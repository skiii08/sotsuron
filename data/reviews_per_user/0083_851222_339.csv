The Rock," Slick, fun and highly entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Rock' (1996) is one of the very best movies from Michael Bay. This is action movie with great actors doing their great jobs. Cast is superb and everyone here plays it straight. Action scenes are amazing, still this day. Chemistry between Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage is the driving force and Ed Harris creates one of the most memorable and sympathetic villains in movie history - without them this movie wouldn't be this great. Story is simple yet script is very entertaining. It is also very funny at the times, with best lines coming from Sean Connery - his 'seen it all' character creates a great contrast to Nicolas Cage's character.Overall, 'The Rock' is a bad-ass action film with superb performances and great action scenes. Movie works because reliable actors create these characters we do care about. Soundtrack is also great. All in all this is a must see action film from the 90's.",9,2,2,23 August 2015
Ford v Ferrari," One of the very best movies from 2019
","Greetings from Lithuania.Some say that 'Ford v Ferrari' (2019) is a must watch for all who are 'motor-head'. I personal do not think so - i think it is a must watch for all who love great and involving cinema. I do not like car sports personally, but when i see movies like 'Rush' or now 'Ford v Ferrari' i kinda wish would like it more.'Ford v Ferrari' is a great movie. It is superbly directed, write, acted, edited and crafted from start till finish. Running time 2 h 30 min ran like a wind because this movie was amazingly involving and paced. I did not know this story, therefore for me everything here was a surprise (story wise), but even more i was surprised after i realized that this might have been the best movie that director James Mangold has ever done, and i loved his 'Logan'.Overall, whether you like car sport or not, this movie is for everyone. It is stupendously involving from start till finish. Definitely one of the best movies of the year.",10,0,0,16 February 2020
The Blair Witch Project," A Real Horror Movie Classic
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) was a movie that started 'found footage' genre way back in 1999. I remember watching this movie like 3 times upon its release on VHS, and every single time i was terrified of it. Many good and bad thing were said about this movie, so i won't repeat it, this is a great horror movie (skip negative reviews), which in a best horror movie traditions doesn't show you evil things (or does it?), but plays with viewers imagination with images, with sounds, with mood. Overall, 'The Blair Witch Project' is a true horror classic, which by this day is probably seen by everybody who loves this genre. Really looking forward to see this new sequel and will probably revisit this legendary movie one more time. Great movie.",9,1,3,16 September 2016
The Lobster," Original, intriguing, provocative and absurd
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Lobster' (2015) is definitely a very good movie. The first hour was simply amazing, the second half was a bit weaker, but as a whole this movie is very original, very intriguing, interestingly written, very well acted (especially by Colin Farrell, it's one of his best roles actually). The premise and concept of this movie were original, and it's a very hard thing to achieve in 2016 when so many plots have been already used or re-done remade and etc. - 'The Lobster' is truly one of the kind.Overall, 'The Lobster' isn't for everyone. Those who appreciate something original and fresh, made not for mainstream audiences but at the same time done very well and professionally will enjoy 'The Lobster' more then those looking for some stupid comedy. This is a very good movie.",9,1,6,19 April 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Great Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.First things first - i did like 'Blade Runner 2049' (2017) more then i did the first movie, and that movie was a good one on entertainment level, and amazing on its theme and craftsmanship. That said, 'Blade Runner 2049' is great movie, simply wonderful one. On almost every level.Its impossible to distinguish on thing that makes this sequel great. Its the amazing cinematography by a legendary Roger Deakins to start with. It the great story and solid screenplay. Great acting by everyone involved, and great directing by a great Denis Villeneuve. Set design and special effects were simply... true - it literally takes you the place, not to mention amazing music by legendary Hans Zimmer. Take all these talent and result is very clearly seen.Overall, 'Blade Runner 2049' is simply a great movie, the one that in my opinion surprised the great original. Every single shot in this is movie is a thing to be seen and admired on biggest screen possible. Great movie.",10,4,13,13 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Predictable, yet not bad for one evening
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Million Dollar Arm' (2014)is a very predictable, yet good looking movie. It's actually constructed very smoothly, on the running time at almost 2 hours it doesn't drag a bit. Acting is OK, script is nice and directing is very solid. Yet i will consider this movie as a disappointment because it's soooo predictable, based more on a movie formula than on actual story itself. After 15 min you will know exactly what is going to happen, how and who will end up with who at the end. Did i say that this picture is predictable? Overalall, 7/10 for 'Million Dollar Arm' - it's a very good looking good feel type of the film (Disney - no wonder), yet it's so predictable, so formulaic that if you have ever saw couple of movies about sport, it means you already saw this picture - it's nice for one evening, but don't expect anything more.",7,0,0,10 October 2014
First Man," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.Spoiler alert - 'First Man' (2018) is a great movie. The story it told was not surprise to me as it shouldn't be to any human being. What surprised me a bit, is how superbly this movie was crafted. The story centers on a First Man who was on a moon, but its also a personal story. There is a heavy doze of his life, his looses and his biggest win.Craftsmanship of this movie is amazing. Music was superb, directing was Oscar worthy and while acting did not blew me away, everyone was just terrific.Overall, 'First Man' is a superb, haunting and amazing. It puts you very closely near Neal, when most of the movie is simply told from his perspective. Great movie.",10,0,4,23 January 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A great warm up to the final chapter
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1' (2014) is a truly enjoyable movie, if you liked the first two. I'm not a fan of the series, and don't wait for these movies to come up, haven't read books and i don't even try to watch them as soon as possible, but when i do i enjoy them very much.Part 1 continuous the story where it left in previous movie, but i won't go into details here. If you liked first movies, you will like this one as well nevertheless it doesn't feature any games this time. It's all about revolution from now.Overall, Part 1 is a very solid movie on it's own and a great warm up to the final chapter. It's has some solid acting (especially from the lead, but no wonder here), nice settings, interesting and involving plot, very good special effects (although there aren't many of them here). Looking forward for a final installment.",9,0,7,8 April 2015
Come and See," Great Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Come and See' (1985) is a powerful, brutal and unforgiving take on a WW2. This movie, more like experience left me speechless and angry. Angry on humanity itself. Its unthinkable to see these things that happened, and they did happen. Overall, 'Come and See' is a bold and mesmerizing experience. It literally transported me to the place and time, in which i did not want to be. You can only witness it from outside and still feel anger. It shows you humanity on its knees, in its darkest times. It shows you what human can do to another human, only to call some of them human is a disgrace to human race. Great movie.",10,3,3,16 March 2018
Howl's Moving Castle," Big disappointment
","Greetings from Lithuania.If you like Hayao Miyazaki's works you might be pretty disappointed by 'How's Moving Castle' (2004). Visually this movie looks amazing - so many colors, drawings - sometimes they are breathtaking. But the story here is absolute mess. The beginning was intriguing. Later, at somewhere around ~40 min in it's running time, and starting to have some questions. Later on, i started to wonder - what the heck is going on in here. By the end i didn't care at all - just which it would end sooner, but this movie is SO long, way to long. I know that this is fantasy, but in director other movies stories were very interesting and intriguing, but this one lacks any credibility. By the end of this movie i had so many question why that or that happened, how and etc. But it would have had any sense, i would care.Overall, 'How's Moving Castle' is amazingly looking and amazingly empty and not involving movie. The story is here is beyond any fantasy stories he ever made, there are no rules - everyone can fly or whatever. It's ridiculously boring, and it's hard for me to say this because i truly admire this director Work, but this one is just pretty lame.",5,2,7,13 May 2015
Alien 3," Nice movie on it's own; Bad Alien / Aliens sequel
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Alien³' (1992) has two sides. As a standalone movie it's not bad, but as a sequel to two classics, it'a a bad one. Sure, it's easy to dismiss this movie and call it bad when you compare it to two movies masterpieces. Two things that were interesting in this flick every time i watched it were surprisingly to me Charles Dance's character Clemens, and second Ellen Ripley of course. Clemens was the most interesting character in this movie. I know that this movie have had big problems during making, especially script rewrites, and you can clearly see this, it has plot holes, and not really focused on anything. Even creature itself was a big letdown - take whatever you want scene from 'Aliens' with the creature and you will see that on 18 million dollars budget (4 times smaller than Alien³) maestro J.Cameron made a multi times better looking creatures than this one, which is sometimes CGI, good at the time, but very out dated now. I saw 'Aliens' and 'Alien³' recently back to back in one day, and 'Aliens' put 'Alien³' on a shame in every possible way. Sadly 'Alien³' is not comparable movie with it's precedes.Overall, 'Alien³' is not a bad film, just don't even try to compare it to 'Alien' or 'Aliens', and it's not a bad flick. I even voted 9/10 just for the love of this masterful franchise, which is probably my favorite ever.",9,2,3,26 October 2014
The Monuments Men," NIce movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Monuments Men' which has a great cast, isn't an Oscar material, and it does not try to be one. What it want's to be and what it successfully accomplishes is a good feel film about dark times. It's a bit comedy, well acted, well photographed and very well directed - i liked this film. It's not 'Schindlers List' , it's a nice adventure flick set in the II world war, based on the real events, about group of art lovers, who were saving art in the surrounding of hell. Overall, 8/10 for this flick, and skip the highly negative reviews, this is a quite, and very solid entertainment.",8,0,1,18 June 2014
Your Name.," Great story
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Your Name' (2016) surprised me more then i thought it will do. It has a lot of going on here, with some school student problems at the beginning, body swapping story later and then some more - i won't spoil it. The story here was great, if a bit maybe to complex down the road. Music was beautiful as well as voice acting and animation. Script was very involving. 'Your Name' is also a very beautiful love story.Overall, the only reason i'm not voting it higher is because i was a bit lost near the end. While the story is great and not one dimensional one, it was a bit to complex for my taste. Yet second viewing would be required. All in all 'Your Name' (and what a beautiful title) is surely not to be missed one by anyone who loves great stories beautiful told.",8,4,8,17 August 2017
Captain Phillips," Very well acted and constructed movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Captain Phillips' (2013) is a very good movie. Great acting by all involved, very solid directing by a great Paul Greengrass - from first minutes till the very last ending this movie grabs you and hold you totally involved. The fact that is based on a very true events (i heard about them at the time on news) gives a huge advantage to whole experience. Everything in this movie works very well to keep glued to the screen.Overall, 'Captain Phillips' got his 6 Oscrar awards nominations not by accident. It's a very well produced motion picture, superbly acted and constructed from start till finish. It's not 'Die Hard' type of flick, but if you like intense and gripping stories (that are actually based on very true events), this one is not to be missed.",9,0,2,31 January 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Very effective thriller with some way over the top ending
","Greetings from Lithuania.The last act of '10 Cloverfield Lane' (2016) for me was a bit a disappointment, given what a movie successfully established before - a great suspenseful thriller. That said '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a highly enjoyable thriller, with superb performances by all three leads - especially by John Goodman. If you liked the first movie, it kinda doesn't mean you will enjoy this one as well, because the setup and the whole story is set totally different, it only shares the same universe. I was involved into this movie from the first minutes till the end - it was a superbly paced movie. Overall, if not for the last act of this movie, which was i my opinion anti-climatic (considering all that was set up before), '10 Cloverfield Lane' is superb thriller. It is very involving, with some mystery, very solid acting, great pacing and tight script. Highly recommended.",8,3,4,13 June 2016
The Equalizer," Great action thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Equalizer' (2014) is a very well made action thriller. Acting was solid, directing, script are the first rate. The picture is superbly paced - at 2 hours running time it never drags or gets boring. The movie kinda surprised me whit it's plot, i guest it the other way around at the beginning of the film, but i was surprised. It's R rated so don't be surprised that it's violence is on screen - it would have been impossible for this movie to have other more soft rating - violence (but not gore) perfectly fits this brutal, dark and gritty world.Overall, 'The Equalizer' is first rate picture that every action thriller fan should not be missed.",9,2,10,17 December 2014
War Dogs," Superb movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'War Dogs' (2016) is highly involving, superbly made movie based on a very true story. I do think this is Todd Phillips best yet, even better then great 'The Hangover' which i loved. Script was very involving from the get go. Acting was superb by everyone, especially of course by two lead but especially by Jonah Hill. Directing was very solid as well as some superbly old songs that played right when they needed to be played.Overall, 'War Dogs' is a superb movie on all amounts. It is highly involving, very strongly acted, superbly written and very solidly directed true story. You can't ask for more.",10,2,4,1 December 2016
Source Code," Great movie. Only should have ended 8 minutes earlier.
","Greetings from Lithuania.Great film. This is the best thriller I've seen this year so far. The writing is outstanding. Actors are great. Directors work, cinematography is good.I have only one problem with this film, and it's the ending. They should have ended it when the life support was turned off, everybody on a train where happy living their last moments, Jake Gyllenhaal saying 'What would you do if you have one minute left to live' and Michelle Monaghan answering 'I would make those seconds count' and everything freezes on a beautiful and poetry note. But, they put an ending, that makes totally no sense at all, just like 'Deja Vu'. It's just didn't work to me. When i'm going to thing about this movie i'll think about my ending :) Overall, a very good Sci-Fi thriller.",10,0,2,24 July 2011
Iron Man 3," Entertaining and much better then the messy Iron Man 2
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Iron Man' 3 (2013) was an entertaining action blockbuster which had much more linear story and better writing the second movie. Surely the first one was and still is the best from the trilogy, but this second movie improved over Iron Man 2. Special effects were great, action scenes were good and the whole tone didn't seems so cheezee as in the second movie.Overall, Iron Man 3 is an entertaining movie which does not drag, had a great action and better story as well as writing then the lackluster 2nd part. Fun movie all around.",8,2,2,14 November 2018
Child 44," Very good story with nice execution
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Child 44' (2015) is well made drama / thriller / mystery story. The story itself is very well and intriguing, and kinda fresh in my opinion. There is a saying that good movies about Russia can create only Russians, but 'Child 44' is nice exception.Acting was good by all involved, cinematography is OK but nothing special and direction was nice. Set design was great. At running time 2 h 6 min this movie drags a bit here and there but i was involved into story from start till finish. I liked the very realistic approach to Stalin era Soviet Union.Overall, 'Child 44' has big story, which sometimes felt like to big for one movie. It good drama thriller set in fresh surrounding. It won't win any Oscars, but it's a definitely nice movie.",8,3,11,19 July 2015
Deepwater Horizon," Deepwater Horizon
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Deepwater Horizon' (216) isn't the best 'based on true events' movie I've ever seen, far from it, but what it did it did so well - kept me involved into this story for the whole 1 h 40 min during which more then one time i was like 'oh my God!' during the horrific event. I do of course remember the story when it took place in a real life, and Peter Berg i think did they outstanding job into showing us what has happened (partly at least) during that horrific night. Acting was pretty solid, directing 'is Peter Berg all the way' - which i love it and special effects were really good / great - you kinda can feel the heat (no wonder it got 2 Oscar nominations in tech. categories).Overall, 'Deepwater Horizon' is a very good action film (yes) based on a very true events. It is superbly crafted picture.",9,1,2,5 February 2017
United 93," Masterpiece on all accounts
","Greetings from Lithuania.'United 93' (2006) isn't my favorite picture by a mile. But this is probably the ONLY movie in my lifetime which left me speechless, for like literally 10 minutes after credits start rolling. Words can not express for devastating, vulnerable, angry i felt after first few minutes when this movie ended. I can not recall when a movie took me so hard, delivered me to the place and left me experiencing events so purely like 'United 93' did. It is not a movie where you can identify with someone - you are just a viewer, seeing things from outside - in the beginning (because the whole picture is shoot in almost documentary style). After some time, you won't be feeling yourself as a viewer - you will be in there, with theme, at the time, EXPERIENCING everything. Strange, but i didn't felt like i was seeing good guys and / or vs. the bad guys (although they are the worst what planet Earth could produce in it's lifetime - that is my opinion). That is because of the brilliant and one of the kind to say the least directing and screenplay by Paul Greengrass - for this movie he should be remembered forever (calm down - no one will ever forget 'Bloody Sunday' or even 'The Bourne Ultimatum' - but i do not want to even hint on title 'Born' in with the movie like 'United 93', which is a most powerful tribute, probably, ever). Overall, if you are human being with emotions and comprehension - 'United 93' is something to be witness by yourself. Don't be shine to be devastated by it - it is how a human nature should be responding to it. And to all of you who hated it and called it propaganda and etc. - i feel sorry for you - this masterpiece isn't for you, although it should have been... as we are all human.",10,0,1,7 June 2016
It," Superb
","Greetings from Lithuania.'It' (2017) isn't the most scariest movie I've ever seen, damn, its even not the most scary movie I've seen this year, but it is a hands down the most involving horror movie I've seen in many moons, simply because first and the most important thing - it a very, very good movie /drama WITH horror theme. Script and directing here were top notch. Music was excellent and acting by all young actors were superb. Overall, 'It' works as a good drama and good horror movie. Its superbly well paced - at running time 2 h 5 min i was never bored or lost interest in this story. Superb movie all around.",10,7,19,8 September 2017
Hereditary," One of the most original horror movies I've seen in a while
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Hereditary' (2018) will be a disappointment for those who look for cheap jump-scares type of horror flicks. This is a very slow burning movie which builds its story and outcome. Near the end the movie was highly creepy and scary. And the story here is great - not your typical horror flick story. Script and directing by Ari Aster were truly great - there are some highly original shoots in this movie. Acting was phenomenal by Toni Collette - she shouldn't be overlooked when the best actresses considerations of the year will start circling. Overall, while 'Hereditary' is not the most scary horror movie I've seen in years, it is definitely one of the most original ones.",9,6,11,27 August 2018
If I Stay," Meehh
","Greetings from Lithuania.'If I Stay' (2014) is so sweet and cheezee that unfortunately it comes as a disappointment for me. There is absolutely no chemistry between two leads, and when a movie about love and life has no chemistry between lovers, it's a problem. 'If I Stay' is nothing new, nothing original, just an empty eye candy at running time 1h 40 min. It drags. The pacing is OK but the screenplay is so predictable, so one dimensional and cheezee that at moments i had my eyes rolling over the screen. Chloë Grace Moretz has nothing to do in this flick, it's definitely far from her best. Overall, for 14 years old girls this will do just fine, for all older i can say, you can safely skip this. It's not a bad movie by any means, just unfortunately it's very predictable, it has nothing new or exciting to offer and at running time 100 min. it drags and repeats itself - it has well intentions, but unfortunately it just doesn't click.",6,10,20,16 November 2014
Training Day," Excellent Action / Thriller with Superb Lead Performances
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Training Day' (2001) is definitely one of the most memorable action thrillers that came in a period 2001 - 2010. It has amazing acting by two leads, which is thousand times better then in your usual genre movie, acting by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke is one of the kind here. Denzel creates this Alonzo guy - a crooked cop on the edge so memorable, that it actually carries this movie in higher realms. No wonder he won Oscar for this performance, when usually no one wins Oscars for action movies - it is a statement of this performance is one of the kind. Directing by Antoine Fuqua was great as well as solid script by David Ayer. It is an intense, involving movie that you kinda can't stop watching no matter how many times you have seen it whenever you catch it on TV - it is that good.Overall, 'Training Day' is a great genre movie which goes above the rest genre movies because of a legendary performance by Denzel Washington. solid script and good directing. You can't ask more from a straightforward action thriller.",9,0,0,29 March 2017
Detroit," Gritty, intense and involving
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Detroit' (2017) is a very good movie from start till finish. It is superbly acted, directed and written true story. The great duet Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal teamed up again after two masterful and one of the most two memorable movies of the past decade 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty'. While 'Detroit' is not in the same league as two above mentioned titles, yet their collaboration is clearly visible in every scene.Overall, 'Detroit' a gritty, intense and very involving thriller based on a very true story. A very solid movie all around.",9,2,4,25 June 2018
John Wick," Headshot
","Greetings from Lithuania.'John Wick' (2014) is a very cool action flick. It has Keanu Reeves in a bad-ass role, playing an unstoppable hit-man who goes on a vengeance road after his dog is ... well i won't spoil it. This flick is very well constructed - great action scenes, lots of blood (but not gore), simple but strong central character and a lot of bad guys to shoot at. John Wick had probably more head-shots in this movie than i got in a 'Call of Duty' - that's how you make sure that bad guys are dead for good.Overall, 'John Wick' is a very enjoyable action flick. It has over the top central hero, very simple but cool story, great action scenes. Do not take it to seriously and if you enjoy action movies, 'John Wick' is not to be missed.",9,6,15,26 January 2015
A Star Is Born," A Great Modern Classic
","Greetings from Lithuania.So i finally watched 'A Star Is Born' (2018) after all the praise, Oscars, money, admiration and love it gained starting from its release. What took me so long from seeing it! Damn, what a great modern romance / music movie that is. 'A Star Is Born' sets a bar for all future modern music movies - i don't ever want to see anymore in a future movies any actors mimicking their music performances or music people trying to act - 'A Star Is Born' (2018) showed, what can be done when such talents do what they do best and not only one of them directed the movie for the first time, but what a great, modern classic it is.Overall, 'A Star Is Born' is a Bradley Cooper's masterpiece. Terrific acting to say the least, directing, writing and music itself elevates this movie into a modern classic. Great movie all around, loved every minute of it.",10,0,4,27 March 2019
Gravity," Alfonso Cuarón's 'Gravity'
","Greetings from Lithuania.It's been two weeks since i saw 'Gravity' and i still can't forget this movie experience. Experience is a word that comes closest to mind when talking about 'Gravity'. This movie will make feel. Can't remember last time i saw more visually stunning and bold movie. Films like these come once in a decade. They touch you. 'Gravity' is a film that must be experienced in a theater, 3D. This is definitely the best 3D film yet, and i loved 'Avatar'. Watch this masterpiece in theaters while it's still runs,because movies lake this, as i said, comes very rarely. 'Gravity' will definitely win Oscars for best special effects and cinematography - they are breathtaking.Alfonso Cuarón is master director and S.Bullock gives performance on a lifetime, it's that good.",10,4,8,19 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Good, but not great.
","Greetings from Lithuania.I read some reviews about 'Lone Survivor' where it was mentioned alongside to a 'Saving Private Ryan' - you can throw a rock at me if this comes close to 'Saving Private Ryan' which is beyond many moons and seas compared to 'Lone Survivor'. 'Lone Survivor' is good action movie, with some heroic stuff (they definitely couldn't avoid that...), and i know that it's based on real events, thats why i'm giving it 8, because many of things displayed in picture were sadly true, many, but definitely not all. When someone is being killed in this movie (exept for bad guys from Taliban), it's shown in a similar way as Jim Caviezel aka.Jesus was suffering in 'The Passion of the Christ' - only true American heroes die like that, not afghans who are more or less just a meat between bullets and Americans in this movie.Overall, i liked this action picture, the sound design and sound editing were really top notch (no wonder it got 2 Oscar nominations) - you can hear every detail in the forest, every breaking bone (ye, the fall from cliffs scene was gripping). Actors were just OK, nothing special. The gunfight was terrific at least in the beginning of battle, truly terrific sound design and camera work. Later, well, when bad guys were shooting with RPG's every 2 min to our heroes, and they were suffering real good but still were able to do some heroic stuff, the tension was kinda lost.Overall, 8/10 for me because of good production values and for that it is based on real events.",8,71,115,24 March 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Good comedy, good and intelligent movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.As much as 'Life of Brian' (1979) is a good movie / comedy - its an intelligent movie to begin with. Yes, the absurd it shows us is kinda absurd, but on the other hand, there are even more absurdity in life and religion. I liked the performances in this movie. Directing and script were great. The ending was great. Its not a perfect movie, but i kinda was surprised of how intelligent actually it was if you think about it. Also everyone gets their 'share' in this movie - Jewish, Romans and everyone else. This is a good movie overall.",8,0,1,1 May 2018
Wind River," A movie that makes you to appreciate life more
","Greetings from Lithuania.I was stunned by 'Wind River' (2017). In many moons have i not seen a thriller that caught me right into it with its story, surrounding and a brutality of a human nature. If you would say that these kind of things do not happen in real life every day, i would say you are living in a dream world - good for you.'Wind River' (2017), written and directed by a brilliant Taylor Sheridan (a masterpiece 'Hell or High Water') just made my list of just a few movie creators whose movies i'm looking forward to see the most. This movie reminded me of 'Silence of The Lambs' somehow, but even that movie is like pop song compared to this grounded and brutal look at human nature. How this movie wasn't even nominated for at least one Oscar is beyond me.Overall, while 'Wind River' is not for those looking for a slick and high octane thriller, it sure will leave everyone on the edge of its seat and even maybe start to appreciate life more - you can never know... This is definitely one of the best movies of 2017.",10,0,3,6 July 2018
Se7en," Masterpiece
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Se7en' (1995) is a true masterpiece, and i don't use this word often, actually, i use it very rarely. This film blow me away from the first time i saw it, and i saw it many times after. It's always engaging from start till finish. This is one of the best stories ever told on screen. More of it, the story isn't that really important in this movie. What important is that you will feel your self in there, at the bottom of Dantes inferno, this is New York you won't see in advertising pictures.One of my favorite directors (and of the best ever) master David Fincher created an unforgettable piece of work. This film is must be seen to understand, what a real film is about, and it's not about the action. The ending of this film will leave you speechless.Overall, 10/10 for this motion picture, it's a true art, true cinematic tour De force, with images and characters you won't eve forget after witnessing 'Se7en'. A must watch.",10,2,5,11 October 2014
Unbreakable," What if Superman was here on Earth and didn't know he was a Superman
","Greetings from Lithuania'Unbreakable' (2000) is one of the few best movie by M. Night Shyamalan. That said this is great slow burning psychological drama about a man founding something very interesting about himself. The movie wasn't big hit as director's earlier masterpiece 'The Sixth Sense'. This a different movie in it's narrative, but it's story is very absolving, involving and interesting. Performances are great through the movie, as well as great music, some great cinematography and movie crafting overall. Overall, 'Unbreakable' is as a bit of 'What if Superman was here on Earth and didn't know he was a Superman' more then a straightforward escapism. It is a very solid drama overall and a very solid movie overall.",9,0,3,20 November 2015
Fury," Superb WW2 movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Fury' (2014) is a must see for all moviegoers. Superbly acted, directed and constructed, it's set in WW2. It's not as good as 'Saving Privat Ryan', but it's definitely a gritty, bloody and powerful achievement. The cast is great, everyone is perfectly cast and delivers superb performances except of Michael Peña who was more of comic relief, nevertheless it's a very solid job as well. It's perfectly paced, and a sequence in the middle of the movie within Germans women house was very good, perfectly paced and places.Overall, 'Fury' is great WW2 picture, it has visceral scenes, great battles on maybe smaller scale but gritty as war itself. If you like this stuff, don't miss 'Fury'.",9,2,7,3 November 2014
Akira," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Akira' (1988) is a surprise to me seeing it for a first time in 2019, 31 years after its release. I did not expect for this movie to be such a deep and effective. Animation itself was simply amazing - terrific attention to smallest details. Story itself was epic, deep, dark and brilliant. The storytelling was superb - this movie did not dragged for a second (well, maybe a bit by the end). The world itself was amazing and dark.Overall, 'Akira' is an amazing movie. I'm not anime fan, haven't seen many of them, but this movie i simply loved and admired - every frame of it. Its not perfect, but its great.",9,0,1,17 January 2019
Train to Busan," Excellent
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Train to Busan' (2016) was hands down the most involving, intriguing, nail biting and visceral experience I've seen in many moons, considering this so called 'zombie' genre. It has more in common with '28 Days Later' then G.Romero zombies and even 'World War Z' influence is pretty obvious. But 'Train to Busan' was by a moon better then 'World War Z' - at running time 1 h 50 min. i wished it didn't ended and that happens rarely in movies these days. This is a superbly crafted picture from start till finish. The first ~50 min where nothing short of spectacular - great special effects, superbly constructed action / chase set piece at the station, clear character development and very clear and involving narrative. Second part of the film was just great - a nail biting horror / thriller. Overall, if you do like zombie movies - 'Train to Busan' delivers goods - big time. This is one of the best if not the best example in this genre in some long time. I wasn't a sequel.",10,1,3,1 May 2017
Citizen Kane," A very solid movie with some mystery
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Citizen Kane' (1941) isn't the best or most important movie ever made in my opinion. As there one word cannot explain man's life, one movie can not influence flow of cinema itself. That said 'Citizen Kane' is a very good picture, while it's opening ~17 min are nothing short of brilliant and next 40 min are superb, the movie felt short a bit during the end, with to much being focused on 'the singer' rather on Kane's life itself. There are some truly brilliant camera shoots in this movie, which i suppose was one of the first camera tricks at the time. Acting is very good, especially by Orson Welles - he should have won Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Script is great and directing is also a tip notch, that is why this movie barely drags.Overall, 'Citizen Kane' is a very good movie about with some mystery. I kinda guest the meaning of this word during the end, and last scenes confirmed my guess - it is a good mystery but maybe a bit over-hyped (no spoilers). This movie definitely worth seeing once (even as i'm watching for the first time just now in 2015).",9,3,4,15 September 2015
Darkest Hour," A very good movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Darkest Hour' (2017) is a very good movie by all accounts. It has an amazing central performance by Gary Oldman (Oscar well earned), good and involving script, good directing and story which we all know. It was very interesting to see of how hard it must have been to this man to face a treat like that and to make a crucial decision. And with this performance Gary Oldman made me feel for this man.Overall, 'Darkest Hour' is a very solid historical movie. It is involving, very solidly made and acted, with one exceptional performance in a lead. Very good movie overall.",8,0,3,31 March 2018
The Maze Runner," Entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Maze Runner' (2014) is very well paced, directed and crafted motion picture. It's a very compelling sci-fi, which tells very interesting and involving story. Although the main structure of 'The Maze Runner' will probably look familiar if you have seen more then 100 movies in your life, it's still expertly paced and done so you will be glued to your screen for the whole ride.Overall, 'The Maze Runner' is not to be missed one if you like sci-fi movies, which are good crafted and tells interesting stories. It's not revolutionary good, but it does a very good job for a one evening viewing. I will look forward for sequels.",9,32,62,3 December 2014
Inglourious Basterds," A masterpiece. Simple as that
","Greetings from Lithuania.Going to be short here.This movie is a masterpiece, lets face it.Everything, and i mean EVERYTHING in this movie works on the highest level. Writing is the best one in 2010, and i LOVE 'The Hurt Locker'. Acting, directing is brilliant. Christoph Waltz is unforgettable here, and the others are a joy to watch, especially Diane Kruger (whitch i didn't tough was a good actress before this movie) and Michael Fassbender (he will certainly win an Oscar one day).This is my favorite movie from a cult director Quentin Tarantino. 'Pulp Fiction' follows next. Watch it, this is an unforgettable movie and real joy to all haters of Nazis and fascism.",10,4,11,19 June 2011
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Highly Entertaining Movie With a Perfect Ending
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' (2016) is a superb entry into 'Star Wars' franchise. This is a first standalone 'Star Wars' movie, and it is a superb one. 'Rogue One' tells the story ... well you all probably know what by now. But is does this in a gritty way - it feels and looks more like a war movie then lets say Episode 1 and 2 or 3 did in every possible way. 'Special effects were amazing. Battle sequences up in the sky were great (far more better then in Episode 7). Performances were very good. Alan Tudyk absolutely killed and stole every scene as a K-2SO - can't remember more funny robot in this franchise yet. Script was involving and kinda surprising in ... i won't spoil anything but i surely didn't expected to see so many endings (lets call them that way) in a 'Star Wars' movie. And this is where the ending comes - absolutely amazing and surprisingly gritty but at the same time - hopeful. Overall, 'Rogue One' isn't a perfect movie, but it is surely not to be missed one especially if you are a 'Star Wars' fan. Very entertaining movie with the perfect ending.",9,6,19,15 December 2016
Captain Marvel," A boring cartoon
","Greetings from Lithuania.It would be disrespectful to a cinema to call 'Captain Marvel' (2019) a real cinema. Its a live action cartoon made for kids - that is it. But that is not what makes it pretty bad - its that during whole 2 hours i was bored out of my mind watching this. This 'movie' has zero character building, zero real story and zero involvement - all you get here is just a colorful cartoon - you can't even say anything good about acting - it was wooden and dead on - it looked like no one had interesting in making it.Overall, if this 'movie' wouldn't be a part of MCU, it would tank at box office. It contains nothing of what a motion picture should have. This is an empty and boring cartoon.",4,12,19,6 October 2019
Iron Man 2," A pretty poor sequel
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Iron Man' 2 (2010) had a lot to live up to its great first part. It everything to be a great sequel, same director, more money and freedom, fresh and hot from his Oscar nomination performance Mickey Rourke but at the this movie failed. The reason is pretty all over the place writing of the story. I mean the story itself was OK, but not its writing. The pacing also suffered as they tried to show to many things at the same time.Overall, Iron Man 2 is the worst from its trilogy. It lacked everything that first movie had. Its not a bad movie, but its a very poor sequel considering its great original.",6,1,1,13 November 2018
Alien: Resurrection," Not bad for die hard 'Alien' fans.
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Alien: Resurrection' (1997) is kind of cool movie if you feel nostalgia to previous 'Alien' / 'Aliens' movies. It's far from being at least partly good as those two, but it's a descent 'Alien' movie on it's own, on the same level as 'Alien3', which was OK. It has some style, some interesting shoots from visual point, it has OK acting, so this movie is just OK for spending one evening with, but don't expect to be so engaged in story and movie itself to come back to it for repeat viewings. Unfortunately 'Alien: Resurrection' doesn't have the suspense the first two had because of characters – they are not so sharply written so you could really care for them the way you did for characters in 'Aliens'. The situations they encounter are menacing, well shoot, but again, the characters that you could care is what missing in those scenes – and what a great action sequence underwater – simply the best in whole movie.Overall, 'Alien: Resurrection' is not bad movie at all, it has cool visuals, OK acting, some great action sequences and Aliens themselves! What is missing is better characters, and more human Ripley – and didn't care for her in this movie at all which is strange when I consider her one off my favorite movie characters in the history.",8,1,1,28 October 2014
Passengers," What a terrific surprise
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Passengers' (2016) has to be one of the best guilty pleasure movies I've ever seen. I can understand why it got so many negative reviews from critics and viewers, and you kinda have to leave your believes behind the door when you will watch this movie, because there are some 'how can that be?' moments in this movie, but they are far and in between for a what beautiful, original (!) are simply great this movie is. The premise is original, and kinda fresh (and this goes from a Sci-Fi movie buff). Acting was very good by all (i won't spoil how many faces) involved. Script as well directing was very involving - at running time almost 2 hours i was engaged into this story more that i could have possibly imagined at the beginning. Overall, 'Passengers' is a terrific Sci-Fi entertainment. Its not a very deep on its core (aka Interstellar), but it delivers on a most important thing - to like a movie very much do to its involvement in a story. This one truly delivers a great, great guilty pleasure.",10,2,5,4 March 2017
Zootopia," Brilliant
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Zootopia' (2016) is by far the best animated movie i have seen in many, many and (did i just said MANY) many moons. Script is brilliant. Directing is on the spot and perfectly matched the brilliant script, which has many references to classic movies / shows / or some pop culture references, which youngest audience members probably won't be able to understand, but adults will be in nirvana watching this brilliant animation. Voice acting was also superb - there aren't superstars in every role, but that isn't a letdown, because every voice in here is brilliantly matched to the character, not the other way around. And there is a sequence with Flash - a killer scene.Overall, i do not know what other animated masterpiece should be born in the rest of 2016 that would claim Oscar for best animation in next years Oscars. This is a big winner, which i think can easily gain nomination for the best original screenplay. 'Zootopia' is colorful, superbly funny, excellently paced and amazingly written animated movie which is easily my favorite movie so far this year. Brilliant stuff.",10,6,12,5 July 2016
The 13th Warrior," John McTiernan's Last Great Flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The 13th Warrior' (1999) was always one of my favorite movies of John McTiernan. Maybe that's because i've seen this movie when i was 15- 16 years old, and i saw it like 5 or 6 times, yes, loved this film at the time. What still strikes me the most is how superbly atmospheric this movie was. Set design was superb, you can clearly see many objects build specifically, and they weren't just cheap sets. Actors were all superb and did a great job for this material, only wished to see late Omar Sharif more on screen. This movie plays like a adventure movie (in the beginning), later it becomes like 'Predator' and at the some sort of 'Siege' movie. All genres clicked in here, thus creating this superbly involving and brutal world.Overall, 'The 13th Warrior' was the last great flick of the great John McTiernan, who's carrier after this movie basically went into oblivion (but not because of this movie). Shame. Having this skill of creating superbly involving, intense and plausible looking entertaining movies, he should definitely would be still very helpful around. 'The 13th Warrior' is the proof.",9,4,6,20 September 2016
The Impossible," Powerful and emotional experience
","Greetings from Lithuania.This is great film. Sad, heartbreaking and moving, it also one the best emotional movies in a long time. The performances are a top notch, directing at it's best. Director did a phenomenal job bringing the realism into this movie. This movie is also one of the best disaster movie of recent time. The story is good with a balance of the disaster itself and the aftermath including the search. You won't forget this soon and at the moments you will be speechless, believe me. The Impossible is one of the best films of 2012 - and the late Roger Ebert was absolutely right - two big thumbs up!",9,1,2,10 April 2013
Argo," Amazing thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.Academy got it absolutely right when selected 'Argo' (2012) as the best picture of the year - it is amazing picture. Based on very true story (which i won't repeat again), this is a recreation of the events and this is simply one of very best thrillers i have ever saw. Direction, editing, cinematography, script are flawless. How did Ben Affleck wasn't nominated for best direction is still beyond my. There isn't a single flaw in pacing of this movie, from the opening sequence till the end this movie is masterpiece of tension. Acting is solid by all involved, but it is a craftsmanship of the movie that are true stars of 'Argo'. The only thing that i didn't get (and that is not issue with movie) is that Alan Arkin got Oscar nomination - as good as he is in here, this isn't Oscar worthy role.Overall, if you like realistic nail biting thrillers based on a true story - 'Argo' is the first candidate that comes to my mind. When it comes to pure film making and creation of suspense - this is the film of the highest order and this is one of the times when Academy got it right - this is best picture of 2012 hands down.",10,0,3,18 October 2015
Last Flag Flying," Great acting and writing carries this movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Last Flag Flying' (2017) has to say something about war and politics. It does not like either of them. What i did like about this movie was not its message, perhaps, but acting and writing. On its core its a 2 hours road movie with some war veterans who share some dark secret. There are no revelations at the end of they journey, but there is some sort of accomplishment of what they did on the road.Overall, while 'Last Flag Flying' isn't as good as Richard Linklater's previous movies (far from it), i did enjoy this picture entirely because of veteran actors doing good job and reading fine lines. This is a very anti-war movie without a war and a solid road drama.",8,0,1,7 July 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Kinds should watch it even today in 2019
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) is a great Disney classic which should be seen by youngest ones even today. It has great music, timeless story, good writing and a heart in a right place.Overall, there isn't really much to say more about this movie - its a classic and deserves all praises. Good movie overall.",8,1,1,11 June 2019
The English Patient," One of the best
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The English Patient' (1996) is a superb thing. I saw this picture 4 time, and it took me away every single time. What a picture! 9 Oscars doesn't go so simply to one picture. It's a superb movie making, superb story, and a superb experience all around. Late superb movie maker Anthony Minghella created his masterpiece almost without flaws. Yes, this movie is not for everyone. On the core it's a love story. But at the same time it's so much more. It's represents life and time itself. Every single time i saw this picture, i felt time that is going by, like in this movie, time is irrelevant, and on the same time, no one can escape their destiny, and time itself. Life goes on, and it doesn't really matter if you still here or not, life will go on. This is a haunting movie, it created ideas, feelings in my mind that i will never forget. When we see Hana at the end going in a truck, sun is shining and she is moving by those trees, we see life itself, the world will be still here, only human will change - grab this moment, enjoy it while you can, because time is unstoppable.Overall, 10/10 for 'The English Patient' - a superb love story, a true art in ideas - it's hard to imagine a true moviegoer who won't appreciate this picture.",10,0,0,11 October 2014
Green Room," Realistic, intense and ultra - brutal thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Green Room' (2015) is a one of the most realistic, plausible and highly brutal movies in a recent memory. Why did i gave it 8/10 and not 9/10 ? Well maybe the very, very last ending with someone just sitting and ... talking kinda took away that realistic approach to the material which was showed during the whole 1 h 30 and almost not dragging minutes run time. What this movie stands for the best is realistic screenplay, superb acting by all involved and brutally true gun and not just gun fights and they outcomes - human body isn't meant for human brutality. Performances were superb by absolutely all involved, this is one of those movies were not only good guys shine in their performances - everyone has their moment to shine in this very realistic world. Overall, 'Green Room' absolutely surprised my by it's very realistic screenplay (which kinda isn't always a very good thing actually - and yes, i know it sounds kinda crazy) and very realistic and absolutely brutal approach to the material and some scenes (and there are many of those). This isn't a gore fest, it just shows you a realistic approach and outcome of the ultimate cruelty. A very descent movie, which will kinda stick in your memory for more then one day.",8,4,9,12 July 2016
The Babadook," Nice, but could have been better
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Babadook' (2014) is well made psychological horror flick. It has some truly creepy moments, is extremely well acted by both leads, has nice pacing and director clearly has eye, some scenes are very well paced and crafted. But unfortunately, somehow this movie didn't made impact on me so I could call it great. I was kinda disappointed on the level psychological / horror level, because you can't clearly be sure, was it all just imagination, or was it real, and although scenes at the end hints and shows the true meaning, I wasn't sure, so it left me unsatisfied. I know, some will find this ending and events interesting and absorbing, but I like more when horror pictures doesn't play with you and goes straight – otherwise I can't fully accept the chills and whole scary mood.Overall, this a very nicely made picture, with some genuine scars, bus sadly it didn't kick as much as it could have.",7,0,7,17 November 2014
Us," Slasher movie done a bit differently
","Greetings from Lithuania.As a one who loved 'Get Out', i went to see 'Us' (2019) just tonight on its opening night. At the end i wasn't disappointing of because 'Us' is a very well made, pretty original, superbly acted movie. This is a much more straightforward horror slasher movie then 'Get Out' was, and in my opinion it wasn't as good as that one. But on its own, 'Us' does deliver. Its bloody, funny and pretty original. While it suffered a bit from a pacing here and more near the end, it did enjoyed this movie as a whole.Overall, 'Us' is a pretty straightforward slasher horror flick with pretty original idea, amazing acting by all 4 leads and good writing. Its pacing unfortunately wasn't that great especially near the end, but overall its a good genre movie.",8,6,13,22 March 2019
The Danish Girl," OK movie, but mainly for women (no offense)
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Danish Girl' (2015) is movie mainly for women. Don't get me wrong but as man i had some questions running through my mind while i was watching this movie, and one of them was 'WTF am i watching?', and had some laughs during moments which weren't intended to be funny. That said i have so praise the acting - both leads were mesmerizing, this was amazing acting. Story was well... lets just say there was a story. Directing was nice, because at running time 1 h 50 min this movie had my attention during it's whole running time, more or less. Music was good, and make up and costumes were good as well.Overall, i don't regret i watched 'The Danish Girl', because this is story nicely told. But one viewing of this movie is more then enough for me. This is a bit more then OK movie, hope i didn't offend anybody.",7,2,4,21 April 2016
Knives Out," Intriguing and well made
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Who dunning' type of stories are not my favorite, but i couldn't resist from watching 'Knives Out' (2019). A movie with such a stellar cast and raving reviews from critics as well as audience - i was intrigued. And after watching it i can say - this is a very well made movie with that stellar cast doing an excellent work - you can see and feel that they had a blast doing it. But its directing and script that made this movie work. The intriguing story kept me guessing as well.Overall, there are not many 'who dunnit' type of movies today. And given the cast and writer / director behind it - 'Knives Out' truly stands out as a very intriguing and very well made movie.",8,2,3,9 March 2020
The Secret in Their Eyes," A very solid mystery movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.I found 'The Secret in Their Eyes' (2009) a good mystery movie with some great performances, deep and not one note story and very solid directing. The ending was great. Although the movie dragged a bit during middle, not for a second did i was bored from the overall experience.Overall, 'The Secret in Their Eyes' (2009) is a good movie. It was a powerful story, great acting, writing and directing. Good movie overall.",8,0,0,19 June 2018
The Irishman," A great cinema
","Greetings from Lithuania.The only reason why i did not gave this movie a 10/10 is maybe that the story felt a bit too long, at some points anyway. And maybe de-aging of Robert De Niro didn't seemed as natural as other stars. But that is that. Other than that, 'The Irishman' is a movie like only Martin Scorsese can make. When you watching a movie like this you feel like you are in a hands of a master.The pacing was excellent - even at three and a half hours long this movie is superbly paced. Acting was superb by all of them. Writing was engaging and involving, although i was a bit lost in the beginning.Overall, at the end of the day i still prefer 'Goodfellas' more then 'The Irishman', but only because of that its more focused on its subject. 'The Irishman' on the other hands showed a lot of things a plots, and only if it could have been more consistent on its plot... Anyway, a really great cinema.",9,3,6,9 December 2019
Point Break," Inconsistent yet not bad action flick with some stunning images
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Point Break' (2015) is kinda inconsistent action flick with some stunning visual. It not as good as original, by a mile. That said, this 2015 version isn't bad at all. It doesn't capture that free- spirit aura that kinda had first movie, and it isn't that involving but i have to say i kinda enjoyed it, at least for the first hour. The first hour of this movie was very good until the gold mine scene, from there this movie kinda lost it's track. Later there were also beautifully photographed scenes which unfortunately didn't ad up. Acting was OK by everyone involved. The real star of this movie is the nature itself and how it was photographed - there are some truly stunning images in this movie, and you can clearly see why this movies budget was more then 100 mill. $. Shame that they didn't spend it one script, which feel kinda broken during second part of this movie.Overall, if you are hoping that 2015 version of 'Point Break' will capture the same guilty pleasure of it's proceeder, you won't find it here. On it's own this new movie isn't bad at all. Unfortunately second half of this movie is very inconsistent, with characters popping up in places at the same time that would be impossible. That said 'Point Break' 2015 as a whole isn't not bad flick to see it once, but after seeing it you won't ever gonna want to come back to it again, opposite to first movie, which kinda watch in a couple of years again and again.",7,0,1,25 March 2016
The Fifth Element," Love Will Save The Earth
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Fifth Element' (1997) is a superb escapism. Saw this movie like 4 times in my life, and the last one just recently, so i can safely say - this is a pure escapism. Performances were (really) by all involved - and this has to be the best (still) performance by Milla Jovovich of her carrier. Speciall effects are truly special, while sound, music (great stuff), art design, costumes are great as well. While this movie still drags a bit in it's second act (at Korben Dalla's apartment) by the time the third act begins and Chris Tucker steps in - it is a blast till the very last second.Overall, if 'The Fifth Element' would have been created in 2016, this is probably would have been one the worst movies of the year. But as it was done back in 1997 - it is (and was) a helluva escapism. Great vision, superb effects, great acting and pure energy of it creators still makes this movie a must see. Great, pure escapism.",9,0,1,6 August 2016
Creed," 'Creed' Is A Winner
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Creed' (2015) is everything a one could hope from 'Rocky' movie and more, much more. It tells a story of a new face as well as continuation of our below boxer from Philadelphia. Acting was very good by all involved - leads Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone are above good - they are great in this picture, with Sylvester Stallone absolutely deserving Golden Glob nomination - it's going to be hard to get Oscar node, but lets hope on this one, this is by far the best Sylvester Stallone's performance since 'Cop Land' and very first 'Rocky' movie. But he is just a supporting character in this movie. The new star is Adonis 'Creed' Johnson. Hope to see future movies with him. Overall, 'Creed' is a great movie. It has great acting, amazing direction (one boxing scene is done in one-shot take - never seen that before). Directing is actually on the same level as acting - Ryan Coogler does a magnificent job in every scene - it looks and feels real, not just another sequel or spin-off, it is a real life on the screen. Boxing scenes are all (and there aren't many of them in the movie) great - last one (and you know there will be the last one 'good guy' vs. 'bad one') is not predictable (which actually is a bit, but that is not a complain to 'Creed'), very plausible and realistic. Can't recommend this movie higher - 'Creed' is simply a winner.",10,2,4,2 January 2016
The Great Dictator," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Great Dictator' (1940) is only 3rd movie with / by Charles Chaplin that i saw. After watching 'City Lights' (1931)and 'Modern Times' (1936) i can safely say that 'The Great Dictator' is best of this trio.Charles Chaplin is brilliant in double role here, and he shines in both of them, while two of these characters are biggest opposites possible. Direction of this movie (also by Charles Chaplin) is great, and writing is brilliant (Charles Chaplin). I was involved in this movie from the first scene till closing one, and WHAT a speech at the end! I think this speech was more for the people watching this movie (and breaking a 4th wall at the same) - it is a triumph.Overall, 'The Great Dictator' is a great movie by all accounts. It is involving, very funny, tells a story and sends universal and essential message. What else do you want from motion picture?",10,1,3,2 September 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A so so movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' (2009) is a poor installment in the franchise if you will compare it to movies which came till 2015 now. The story is the weakest component in this movie. Directing is also so so, acting was OK, even very nice actually. I won't go into details, but the movie kinda shows us the origins of Wolverine, 'kinda' because it is not very interestingly or memorably done. Special effects were just OK, nothing special.Overall, 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' is probably the weakest entry in the franchise. I'm not the fan of the series, but saw all 'X-Men' movies and this one is still my least favorite. If you are a die hard fan of 'X-Men' you should check it out, if not, you won't loose anything if skip this one.",7,1,1,21 August 2015
Orphan," Superb thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.First time i saw 'Orphan' (2009) is kinda expected it to be supernatural horror movie. I won't spoil anything, but the movie surprised me in a very good way.Performances were very good by everyone involved - especially by Vera Farmiga, Isabelle Fuhrman (superb role) and even Aryana Engineer (as Max). Script as well as directing were very involving - it has great suspense, mystery and even some blood. Overall, i loved 'Orphan' more then i thought i would. At this moment i saw the film for 3rd time on TV, it is not one of those classics to which you kinda need to return from time to time, but as horror / thrillers goes - this one is not to be missed one.",9,1,2,23 April 2017
Spotlight," Very solid movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Spotlight' (2015) isn't the best movie of 2015, but it a very solid and good one. There isn't any action, but at running time 2 h it is very engaging and involving. Directing, script, acting are a top notch. While i did heard about true story on which this movie is based, i was intrigued in a process of that was achieved. This is because once again thanks to great script, directing and acting by all involved. Now about the acting - as much as i would love to see Sylvester Stallone winning Oscar for acting this year, Mark Ruffalo deserves his i think more for acting in this movie. He steals every scene he is into - honestly this one of the very best American actors at the moment - he is always different in all movies, like a great chameleon. But as much i adore Rachel McAdams - i don't get it why she got an Oscar nomination for acting in this movie - performance is good, but not Oscar worthy in my opinion - not even nomination. I didn't get that.Overall, 'Spotlight' (2015) is expertly paced movie. While the story lacks action, you will never will bored for a second. The story which was uncovered here is horrifying, and it happens not only in Boston or USA. Every country in a world has got this problem for more or less degree. Superb movie about true good people uncovering people at their worst.",9,0,0,20 February 2016
Terminator Salvation," Great entertainment
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Terminator Salvation' (2009) is a great entertainment. It not equal to first two movies by far, but it is better then 3rd and surely by many moons better then 'Genisys'. That said 'Terminator Salvation' delivers goods in terms of entertainment and it does a great job in being a 'Terminator' movie set in days after Judgement Day. The world is bleak, set design is very good especially in out-door scenes. Special effects are great (i love the bicycles assault scene especially were one spins over the screen - great scene). Robots are crude and not sharply done by purpose, this is early period of after Judgment Day and Skynet doesn't evolved to create sharp models - they are created for purpose, not fore eye candy. Yet. The only complain about this movie in my opinion was the very end of this movie (after all battles scenes at the camp). Last scenes - they aren't strong and don't leave lasting impressions, but they are not bad by any means. Christian Bale does a descent job, but Sam Worthington gives a superb performance, he is the soul of this movie. McG direction is also solid, he shows us this bleak world. The references to first two movies are great, with lines and characters and etc. Overall, i always highly enjoyed 'Terminator Salvation'. It is not as good as first two movies, but it shows us this universe in new fashion. I would love to see sequence for this movie MUCH more then a dreadful, not involving and just simply boring 'Genisys' - 'Terminator Salvation' delivers what it promises.",9,1,4,2 September 2015
Aquaman," Spectacular, dumb, fun and entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Aquaman' (2018) was big, dumb, very spectacular and very entertaining. The reason why i did not rate this higher is probably because plot seemed so familiar, like seen in hundreds of other superhero movies - literally. And this movie worked because it was spectacular, superbly paced, pretty good acted (uniformly i would say) and it looked just great.Overall, i really enjoyed 'Aquaman' - big dumb and really fun. I will be looking for a sequel.",8,1,10,2 May 2020
My Neighbor Totoro," Honest and very good
","Greetings from Lithuania.'My Neighbor Totoro' (1988) is a one honest, not cynical and masterful movie. The story here is simple, yet superbly told. Never for a second was i bored nor involved into this movie. Script was very good as well direction by a master of genre Hayao Miyazaki. Overall, 'My Neighbor Totoro' is just a joy to watch from the first minute. It has good story and great storytelling, you can't ask for more.",9,1,1,19 September 2017
L.A. Confidential," One of the best, richest movies ever
","Greetings from Lithuania.'L.A. Confidential' (1997) is a true art. This film is gem, it's an unforgettable movie making. Remember when i saw this picture on VHS weeks after it's initial release, at only of being 12 years old (oh my god hod how time flies), i was stunned be this film already - really. Years after, i saw it more and more time, and every single time i saw it something new in it, this picture is like good painting, you have to see it more that once to truly appreciate it. h acting is mesmerizing. Directing is a top notch. Script is great, confusing and at the same time so rich that you will have to see it more than once to true appreciate it. Overall, absolute 10/10 for 'L.A. Confidential' - a true picture, art, thriller at it's best.",10,0,2,11 October 2014
Concussion," Solid movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Concussion' (2015) is a nicely told drama with superb performance by Will Smith. Actually, i my opinion this is one of the very best performances by Will Smith for which he definitely could have (but not necessarily should have) been nominated for Oscar. But because in this year there were more then one absolutely criminally robed movies during that ceremony, i don't even want to mention that award anymore - shame on them.Overall, 'Concussion' is a good drama, which could have been even better if they could stick more to the discovery itself, and not how it made it feel his wife and etc. - that was the weakest thing in the movie. First hour was great, i would have rated it 9/10, but second was not that great, so overall score for 'Concussion' is 8/10. Solid movie which could have been great. And David Morse steals every scene he is in - unforgettable performance.",8,1,3,24 March 2016
Deadpool 2," Not as bold and funny as the first one, but still a good fun movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Deadpool' 2 (2018) is a fan escapism. Its not as bold, original and funny as the first one was, but i still had a good time watching it. Maybe by taking it into more dramatic places creators did not have enough room to inject the boldness that was present in a first movie, but i liked even the direction they took here. There are plenty of action here, cool special effects, some unexpected turn of events and some heart in between.Overall, 'Deadpool 2' is better then many of its competitors right now which are taking them self too serious. This movie also took some direction into more serious approach, and while that did not heart the overall experience, they should make the third one closer to the first one i think, Still, a good movie overall.",8,1,2,11 September 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Fun comedy
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Thor: Ragnarok' (2017) was much more fun then i thought it will be. First and the last thing best said about this movie is that its basically a comedy - and that what i loved about it. It always was a comedies (these movie i mean) which took them self way to seriously. This one on the other said was pure fun from start till finish.Overall, i highly disliked previous part of this movie. This one i loved it. All Marvel movies should be made like this - stupid but fun comedies.",9,1,6,29 January 2018
Children of Heaven," Great family movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Children of Heaven' (1997) is a very economically told pure and simple story. I was genuinely caught into this movie from it's opening shot till the very last end. This is superbly paced and involving movie, which at running time 1 h 25 min. isn't to short nor it is too long - it's length and pacing are excellent. Acting was very good and natural by all involved, especially by children who portrayed young brother and sister. The story as the movie itself are very warm.Overall, 'Children of Heaven' is a superb movie for all family who's best evening with a movie isn't bunch of popcorn and some Marvel flick. This is a very warm and charming movie that will definitely win you over. Great movie for whole family.",9,0,0,29 June 2016
Youth," Superb movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Youth' (2015) was a very good movie by Paolo Sorrentino. Lead actors Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel were very good, and i also loved performance by Paul Dano but it's Jane Fonda who steals scenes when she is in. Others were good as well. There were many references to famous people in this movie, which takes place in some heavenly beautiful SPA and the most obvious reference was to Diego Maradona. The movie is beautifully shoot, there are many beautiful and gorgeous locations, and the whole production seamed sometimes surreal because of that beauty. I also loved pacing of this movie, which at running time 2 h almost doesn't drag, this is a very good sign about a movie in which nothing that much really happens. Music was also fantastic, with opening and closing scenes containing great songs, superbly performed.Overall, before seeing 'Youth' i kinda thought it will be like 'mucho do about nothing', which is basically is true, but nevertheless i highly enjoying this picture. Highly recommended.",9,1,3,19 April 2016
Milk," A very good movie carrier by a mesmerizing performance by Sean Penn
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Milk' (2008) is a superb biopic about Harvey Milk. I have not heard about him before this movie and the whole thing which he was up to is not my kind of thing, but all aside, this movie was great. Now after seeing this movie i absolutely sure that Sean Penn deserved Oscar for this performance more then Mickey R, for 'Wrestler', and although that movie was also very good with great central performance, Sean Penn absolutely killed it in here - now here is some powerhouse acing which you won't see every day. Directing and writing were first rate.Overall, 'Milk' is a great movie. At running time 2 hours i was captivated to see this man's live and what he fought for. This is a very good picture.",9,0,2,7 October 2018
The Terminator," Happy birthday to a monumental motion picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Terminator' (1984) is a true classic, and one of the most important movies ever created. By 'important' I mean that it started lots of things, which later became very common in cinema itself.There isn't anything new that I could write about this picture that was wasn't said hundred times before. Everything in this movie works and clicks on all cylinders. Made only for couple of bucks (in terms of today's sci-fi / 'actionier' budget, even considering B movies) it stuck in people memories forever. How did maestro J. Cameron achieve that?Here are the main reasons in my opinion: Original and high concept story; Very good and believable acting by all involved; Great script; Cool action scenes; Terrific pacing; and of course all cudos to all technical stuff, effects, cinematography and so on. The idea was always the driving force behind movie, which is now safe to call masterpiece. J. Cameron proofed his genius with his first movie (first movie I mean 'Terminator', not flying fish stuff J).Overall, as you have already saw this picture many times, there is nothing new to say. It's a true classic in every meaning of this word. Even now, 30 years after its release, this small budget B movie sci fi flick from 80's is still managing to attract audiences. If you could check some torrent sites, you would always see this film as one of the most down loadable, whenever you check it, no matter what season is, what movies there are – it's always among the most popular. It's simply just for one reason – a true movie entertainment is timeless and ageless.",10,3,3,30 October 2014
Sleepy Hollow," Highly entertaining with superb production values
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Sleepy Hollow' (1999) is superbly entertaining horror comedy. It's no surprise that it's funny movie, because when budget is 100 million $ you can't simply make a horror flick, it would be to risky. Thankfully this movie was fun from the beginning till very end. Set design of this movie is simply one of the very best ever created till this day. Film looks astonishingly, with all Gothic touches, it is definitely of the best and stylish looking movies of all time. The story is very good and intriguing, it plays like good old fashioned mystery with horror elements. Although i don't find this movie particularly scary, it has some spooky moments.Overall, 'Sleepy Hollow' is now a some sort of classic. It still looks incredibly amazing, and maybe pacing of this movie suffers a bit there and there, but this movie overall is a lot of fun.",9,1,1,1 November 2015
Ready Player One," Entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Ready Player One' (2018) is the kind of a movie which i didn't realize i haven't see before. Its not that i missed it, but i liked how it played out. This movie is going to be pure heaven for those who plays a lot of videos games, loved movies and etc. because it is heavily inspired by those same movies, games and etc. I did not read the book, but i liked this movie a lot. 'The Shining' sequence was big a pleasant surprise to me. Special effects were really great and there is a lot of them in this movie.Overall, 'Ready Player One' is pretty smart, has tons and tons of popular cultural references and is really superbly made. All in all this is pure entertainment.",8,1,2,24 February 2019
The Hateful Eight," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Hateful Eight' (2015) is a bloody great entertainment. If you never were a fan of Quentin Tarantino, this movie probably won't make you his fan now. Nevertheless, 'The Hateful Eight' is closer to 'Reservoir Dogs' then anything he has ever made, it is like 'Reservoir Dogs' in the old west. The plot is very simple here actually, i won't go into the details or spoil anything, but this is kinda straightforward story. But it is done SO good, that at running time almost 3 hours i was involved, intrigued and engaged with a story very much. Script is great as usual, acting is electrifying by all involved, music is haunting, directing is very solid. As much as i enjoyed 'Django Unchained', which is more epic in every way, i have to admit that finally 'The Hateful Eight' involved me more into the story - sometimes less i better.Overall, this is a great movie. It has a very simple yet jigsaw type of plot, great performances, amazing and involving writing. 'The Hateful Eight' is much more serious in tone then 'Django Unchained' and is much more closer to 'Dogs'. All in all this is a great movie on all accounts.",10,5,11,7 March 2016
"I, Tonya"," Powerhouse acting in a very involving movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'I, Tonya' (2017) is a masterfully acted, written and directed movie. Performance by Allison Janney for which she won Oscar was great, but its Margot Robbie who stole the show in my opinion - this is a powerhouse acting at is best. I never heard before of Tonya Harding, but i was very involved into this story. Storytelling and script in 'I, Tonya' were superb - this is a movie which is hard to put on when you start to watching it.Overall, 'I, Tonya' is just a superb biopic - biopic like you have probably haven't seen yet. It doesn't shay away from anything and does not show people in more beautiful colors then they were. A superb movie.",10,0,0,2 April 2018
Molly's Game," Highly involving and very well made
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Molly's Game' (2017) is a very well made movie based on a very true story. Aaron Sorkin shined here with his amazing screenplay - he also directed this movie (his first one ever). Jessica Chastain shines in here as well playing a real life person Molly Bloom. Overall, at running time 2 h 20 min i found this movie to be very involving because of a great script and superb acting. A very good movie overall.",9,1,2,30 July 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Great story, great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.While 'BlacKkKlansman' (2018) isn't the best movie of the year (although it earned that nomination), its surely is a superb one. The story here is a very involving one, directing by a legendary director was very solid (that might me his most enjoyable movie since 'Inside Man'), and acting was amazing by leads, but my favorite was from Jasper Pääkkönen as Felix Kendrickson - he stole every scene in my opinion.Overall, 'BlacKkKlansman' is funny (in some dark way), involving, superbly paced, directed and acted movie. It tells a story which is kinda more then relevant today, and as the ending suggest, its more then a real one. Great movie at the end of the day.",9,6,10,28 January 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not bad but far from best Spider Man movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (2017) for me isn't the best Spider Man movie by far. To be honest, i did like 'The Amazing Spider-Man' (2012) and its sequel (!) much more then i did this one. Although 'Homecoming' is pretty entertaining and fun, it felt formulaic and yes, of course, predictable (which Marvel movie isn't??!). Because these isn't anything to talk about in acting category (and that stands for all Marvel movies), needless to say movie does look good but nothing that great. It does feature some nice action scenes, but the 3rd part of this movie (in which a superhero meets super villain and as usual superhero wins) dragged - usual stuff when many things blows up but apparently no one ever dies in Marvel galaxy. Overall, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is somehow fun and entertaining, but it does not deliver anything fresh to the table. Many were complaining about previous spider movies saying 'oh no another origins story' - and here is a movie which does not deliver origin story and guess what - its as formulaic as Marvel movie can be. Not bad flick overall, but that's the best i can say about it.",7,1,4,22 November 2017
The Bodyguard," The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Bodyguard' (1992) is a wonderful drama / thriller / romance. It is not cheese romance by a mile, you can point your finger at any direction these days and find much, much more cheese movies then this one. Acting was solid by all involved, but especially of course by our leads Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston - we do care for these two sharply drawn characters. Directing was solid as well as involving script. And the outcome with the killer wasn't the for me the ultimate ending of the story - it surely was that plane scene.Overall, two great charismatic leads, involving writing and amazing (one of the kind) music makes this a very cool movie. It has some romance, it has some thrills and its all done in a very good way - add the unforgettable soundtrack and 'The Bodyguard' becomes the ultimate guilty pleasure.",9,0,1,14 September 2016
The Beach," Good movie, if not for everyone
","Greetings from Lithuania.I always like 'The Beach' (2000) more then it probably deserves it. I has breathtaking scenery, nature is itself is wonderful and it was wonderfully shoot. The story itself is simple yet more complex then it appears. This is not a straightforward adventure drama as it might look like, it tries to go a bit deeper, and it is even a pretty good character study movie. Movie also raises some interesting questions from words of its protagonist Richard, he also has some interesting thoughts during the movie about humans being as vermin - trashing this planet to its core. When heroes of this movie finds safe haven on earth, it is not as innocent as it seems. Overall, 'The Beach' is a bit more then a simple straightforward adventure drama flick. Maybe sometimes it tries to do and show to much that it looses it excellent pacing and flow. But all in all this is a one hard to forget and not to enjoy movie experience.",8,0,2,23 October 2016
Alien," Pure masterpiece
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Alien' (1979) is a masterpiece, pure and simple. If there is still anyone who somehow haven't seen it (i can't imagine how could that be even possible), do your self a favor a watch it, not with your friends on Friday evening, but alone and let this movie blow you away. I saw this picture for 5-7 times in my life, and the last time i did (actualy today), was on my 2m x 2m screen projector with all sound system ready to roll. This is timeless film because of many things. The atmosphere, the rising tension, the craftsmanship of the scenes, acting - it all works here because they are not overplayed, and build on seemingly simple approach. 15 minutes into this movie again i caught myself that i forgot everything and i was in there, with them. Thats because of the script, directing, acting - it's all in the first place here, not settings, which still looks great - a bit dated, maybe, but it's not Star Wars type movie were visuals have to be sharp - 'Alien' shows things in shadows, moody style to create feeling of uncertainty, and it does it brilliantly - that is why this movie is never going to age. Please don't ever compare it to even superior (in my opinion) 'Aliens' - 'Alien' is different kind of a movie, it's purpose was to scare people with deadly and very claustrophobic atmosphere, settings and the creature itself, to feel people uncomfortable (in a good way) knowing that no one is safe here and around every corner there could be your end - just look at the close ups near the end of the movie, or shoots where camera is showing person and a deep dark space behind him, thats were imagination starts to fill the darkness.Overall, 10/10 for one of the greatest achievements in the art of movie making.",10,6,10,22 October 2014
Malcolm X," Great biopic
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Malcolm X' (1992) is a great biopic. Its an epic story about man known as Malcolm X. I didn't know much about the man himself, therefore this movie was really interesting to me. But what makes this movie great is that is very entertaining picture. It is superbly paced - at running time 3 h 17 min it barely dragged and was involving from start till finish. Acting by Denzel Washington was phenomenal - but i did not expected anything else - he basically carrier the whole movie. Directing by Spike Lee was great, This movie also has great costumes and overall design was very good.Overall, i really enjoyed 'Malcolm X'. I learned much more about him and the history around him. This is a very good, old fashioned biopic.",9,1,2,24 February 2019
Black Mass," A very solid true story movie, not the best gangster movie by far, but a very descent one
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Black Mass' (2015) is a very true story about a local mobster in Boston, who by the help of FBI ruled the streets for some time. This is a very good movie, absolving one, with great acting by all involved, very solid directing, engaging script that never isn't boring, and is involving from start till finish. That said 'Black Mass' isn't 'Goodfellas' by any means, because you can re watch 'Goodfellas' again and again, and 'Black Mass' is basically a one time movie, but nevertheless it is a very solid one. The best acting in this movie was not Johnny Depp's (altough he is VERY good in here, haven't enjoyed Johnny Depp's movie in very, very long while now), but from superb and always reliable Joel Edgerton. He creates or recreates in this case this FBI guy, who is as much as a good guy trying to do good, but at the same time he is more then an friend to James 'Whitey' Bulger - and that isn't a really good thing considering the circumstances, but he was as he was. This is a very solid performance. And about Johnny Depp - in the beginning of this movie noticing his eye lenses and make up - it was a bit to heavy in my opinion even distracting, but it grown on me during the movie, it is a very solid performance.Overall, Scott Cooper, a great director (of a brilliant 'Out of the Furnace') does a very solid job in recreating true events. I liked this movie very much, it not a classic by any means, but just a very solid film. I also liked that this movie never tried to show any glimpses of Whitey's redemption or anything like that - he was a bad guy at the beginning, middle and the end - he is just a bad guy. All in all this is a very solid movie for one viewing.",9,0,1,3 February 2016
The Best Years of Our Lives," Great Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Best Years of Our Lives' (1946) is a one amazing single motion picture. I just saw it for the first time now at the end of 2016, 70 years from its original release and i can safely say - this is an absolutely must see movie for everyone. I loved everything in this picture. Writing, of course, comes in the first place. It is a superb one, highly involving, sometimes painfully true and always plausible. Magnificent acting by 4 central actors. Yes, i do believe that there are 4 magnificent performances, first of all of 3 lead men - Fredric March (Al), Dana Andrews (Fred), Harold Russell (Homer) and a terrific performance by Teresa Wright as Peggy who i think was under rated for this performance - i can't remember when i have saw more natural, charming and all the way great performance by a lady from a movies before 1946 - i won't believe that anybody didn't had a bit crush on this charming young lady. And of course directing was amazing, as well as the story itself which is sometimes hard to watch, sometimes hard to not laugh and always amazingly told and inspiring.Overall, all in all 'The Best Years of Our Lives' is great, great movie. At running time almost 3 hours i was captivated from start till the very last frame. The movie ended perfectly, i can not recommend this movie any higher to anyone who hasn't witness it yet - do your self a favor and watch it - this is a unforgettable motion picture. Great movie.",10,6,7,20 December 2016
Suicide Squad," Meeehhhh...
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Suicide Squad' (2016) is a real disappointment. After finally seeing it (extended cut), the best i can say about it is that it isn't a bad movie by any means, but its a very predictable, mediocre and average film overall at is best. Now the first and the biggest disappointment here is a script, with no doubt. It lacks any kind of suspense, humor (dark or whatever) and interest in the story itself. Here you have like worst of the worst criminals (who are more like a movie characters then real baddies), who have to team up for a suicide mission. And think of the most predictable non-exciting ways it will develop from there - and you got 'Suicide Squad'. There is even a scene in a bar in which all baddies sits while the world is ending (sort of), and writers didn't even tried to make it at least somehow darkly funny - every single line is so average and mediocre that i started to roll my eyes, really? The whole Jared Leto / The Joker hype was just a marketing trick - the character has ZERO of ... anything! You could just cut him out of this mess and result would be the same mess. And please don't even mention Heath Ledger in the same speech while discussing the character - they are in a different universes. Of course, writing should be blamed here in a first place.Overall, 'Suicide Squad' isn't a bad movie for seeing it once on a boring evening - and that is the best that i can say about this highly over hyped mess. Now i'm a big fan of DC movie universe overall, i even like it more then Marvel to be honest, but is this really the best they could come up with? Big disappointment.",6,2,3,4 December 2016

And, where i can put it..? No doubt - in 2nd-3rd place - LIKE,SAW.The technical aspects of this film are great. Acting is top notch (L.Di C.did it again).The suspense is good. The ending is 'interesting' (no spoilers here).There is just SOMETHING missing in this film. SOMETHING, that would make it a wonderful/great movie. SOMETHING, that was missing in the island, was missing in this movie too - a HEART/Scorsese's heart. ... 8/10.",8,0,3,20 March 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," OK flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.I'm not a big Marvel fan, nevertheless like many out here i have watched all Marvel movies. I still think that 'Iron Man' (2008) was the best of the bunch, more exiting than 'The Avengers' (2012) - now you can start throwing rocks at me. I also highly enjoyed 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011) - it was very cool movie. And the worst from the bunch was annoying 'Thor: The Dark World' (2013) - crap, not a film. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is what Marvel does the best, it's not very complicated, but very enjoyable action flick - nothing more. Actions scenes are very cool, not overdone in CGI, i was surprised seeing greatly done car chases in superhero movie, they were really cool. Like i said, i'm not a fan of Marvel stuff, so overall, if you enjoy the first Captain America film, you are going to like this one as well. Nothing really new, but still 2 fun hours to waste.",8,1,2,9 August 2014
Life of Pi," Breathtaking movie experience
","Greetings from Lithuania.To say 'Life of Pi' is one the two best movie of 2012 is to say nothing. This is visually most stunning film i've seen in years, yes in years. There are some breathtaking scenes of skies and waters capes, animals an almost entirely CGI created tiger (Richard Parker) makes for an amazing character.I was like a kid while watching this movie and i can't recall when the last time that happened.I'm so stupid that didn't see this movie in a theater. I watched blue ray on my projector, and that was incredible stuff (the 2:35 aspect scene is also a thing of beauty).Overall, watch this masterpiece on the biggest screen you can find, this is a movie for ages.",10,1,3,17 March 2013
Over the Top," Enjoyable flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Over the Top' (1987) is an enjoyable flick. The story is old as the movies itself, there is absolutely nothing original or particularly interesting, but at the end it works. Yes, there some unbelievable stuff, like kid traveling from his home to Las Vegas at end - come on... But one the other hand, it has Sylvester Stallone in his top form, in 1987 - it's surely the only reason to watch it anyway.Overall, 8/10 - very nice music, composed by maestro Giorgio Moroder, corny but suitable for this material acting (altrough kid was mehh..), very predictable plot, and arms wrestling championship, when everything comes at the end to glory of fingertips literally. Kick back and enjoy.",8,2,3,21 September 2014
Doctor Strange," Entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.Strangely, i did enjoy 'Doctor Strange' (2016) more then i thought i would. I haven't read comics (nor it will ever will), and haven't even heard his story before, nor i haven't read synopsis - and i think i even didn't see the trailer of this movie - and this is a strange part - i enjoyed the movie very much. I'm not a fan of Marvel universe (i like DC universe more), but i did see every Marvel movie - they are good escapism type of entertainment, although a bit formulaic and to safe. And 'Doctor Strange' isn't anything fresh or highly original - but everything is so damn well crafted here, that i really enjoyed the whole ride. Overall, great special effects, solid acting, funny / involving and really good script as well confident directing makes 'Doctor Strange' a really good entertainment.",9,6,9,19 February 2017
Barry Lyndon," Amazing
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Barry Lyndon' (1975) is simply a must see for everyone. Sure, if your favorite movies are 'Transformers' franchise, you shouldn't bother with this piece. For all the rest 'Barry Lyndon' will be a movie gem.Everything here works on highest cylinders and creates a deep, rich and unforgettable motion picture. The story and storytelling are amazing. I was captivated from opening scene till the very last end. At running time 180 min. this period costume drama never drags and is involving from start till finish. The production values are a first rate. Cinematography, costumes, music, acting, directing and script are on the highest level. I will be honest, i just watched 'Barry Lyndon' for a first time, and i have to admit it, i enjoyed it more than 'Shining' or 'Full Metal Jacket' - two very powerful pictures. That's i think because story telling in this movie is flawless. It is done so well, so simple that you are drowned into the story totally - can't remember when last time i was so captivated by a story.Overall, 'Barry Lyndon' is a true classic, and after seeing it i can totally agree. It has everything that a great movie must have. If you somehow didn't see this picture yet, do yourself a favor and do it. Take your time, because this movie is very long, but it is done so well, that time will fly fast watching this gem.10/10.",10,3,5,17 February 2015

","Greetings from Lithuania.'Interstellar' to simply put, is a magnificent motion picture. It is a close call masterpiece (surely a classic). The whole hype wasn't just a hype, it's true, and you have to witness it on the big screen to truly appreciate it. It has everything a true sci- fi movie should have and everything that a truly great motion picture must have. Everything here works on the highest level. The music (without doubts, a locked Oscar nomination), sound / sound effects (two possible Oscar winners), acting, directing, script special effects (a sure nominee) are a top notch, and combined with realistic sci-fi ideas, this movie is must see. It has to go down as one of (if not THE) very best science fiction movies off all times.Overall, 'Interstellar' is as good as movies goes. It has everything to held you glued to the screen for almost 3 hours, but trust me, watching 'Interstellar' you will be delivered to a movie magic without a wormhole help.",10,6,15,9 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Jacket
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) is definitely one the best Vietnam war (anti-war actually) movies ever made, although it's not one of my favorites. Maestro Stanley Kubrick created this movie in two very different parts - preparation for a war, and war itself but both of them features people in a 'world of shix', as one character puts it.This is a splendid movie from the get-go, and after seeing this movie for the 3rd time, now i don't even know which part is better, probably the first, with unforgettable and jaw-dropping performances by R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. Second shows war itself, and it is a stunning movie making in every frame - watch this movie on biggest screen possible, some scenes were soldiers move trough a bombed remains of a city are so haunting in it's realism.Overall, 'Full Metal Jacket' is a true movie classic, and i can see why. It's Kubrick's movie written all over it, with long shots were characters act and talk like only in a movies by Stanley Kubrick, always plausible, but with that rare detachment and absolute observation feeling which you can only feel watching this movie genius pictures. This is a great, unforgettable movie - not my favorite from Kubrick, but a superb experience nevertheless.",9,1,2,10 July 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' (2017) to sum it up is a great movie. How in the world of academy Martin McDonagh did not win Oscar for best screenplay and wasn't even nominated for directing is beyond me. This is the best movie of the year.The screenplay itself was amazing. This is a movie which kept me on the edge of my seat during whole almost 2 hours its running time because of how unexpected everything was and at the same time it was absolutely plausible. Acting was a fist rate - no wonder 2 actors won Oscars here. Directing was flawless. Overall, 'Three Billboards' is an outstanding movie. Everything clicks here on a highest possible notes. This is a pure classic.",10,1,3,22 April 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," Great Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Grapes of Wrath' (1940) is a one powerful and heartbreaking movie. It tells a very simple story but does this in a great way. Its been a long time since i felt true sorry for people shown in this movie or more specific life that they had to endure during the time. The craftsmanship of this movie is great - directing (amazing pacing for whole 2 h 8 min), involving and realistic writing as well as great acting. Best performance in this movie was hand down by Jane Darwell who played Ma. She glues the family together in its hardest time - literally i could seen my mom in her - this is a wonderful performance of a wonderful human. Overall, 'The Grapes of Wrath' left me heartbroken many times during its time. The most saddest things for me when watching a movie isn't when somebody cries - but its when a life tries to knock good and hard working people down on its knee. 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a great movie.",10,2,3,18 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Unnecessary and boring mess
","Greetings from Lithuania.I'm not a big Star Wars fan, but i saw 4 films including new spin offs in a theater, and of course all of them at home. But i skipped Episode IX from seeing it in theater because there was no interest after episode VIII, which wasn't bad, but it kinda so so finished this story which was superbly set it episode 7. There was no point of making episode 9 except of course for money, and that clearly shows. I finished watching this movie at home just now in like 4 days. This was the least interesting Star Wars movie since Episode II - Attack of the Clones.Story was a complete mess, because after 40 min or so i kinda taught that maybe a missed some movie in this series, because i have literally had no idea what was going on! And after the movie ended (finally), i still did not really get it what was this movie about. Everyone were running, searching for some relics, going somewhere, with superpowers at their hands that could put even Superman to shame - to have to see it to believe it what superpowers these characters had in this movie!Overall, Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker (2019) was a nice looking but unfortunately unnecessary boring mess. Its the worst type of blockbuster Hollywood does - it even reminded me of some the Transformers movies - all visuals, no real story. Hope they will make big adjustments for new trilogy, which we will eventually get - its just a question of time when.",5,7,11,24 March 2020
American Sniper," Superb movie in all directions
","Greetings from Lithuania.'American Sniper' (2015) is a must see movie for all who enjoy great movies. This one has it all - outstanding acting by lead, and superb performances by all involved. Direction is confident, clear, engaging and superbly paced. At running time 2 h this movie never drags. Set design is superb, you really feel like you are in location during the whole movie, and outstanding cinematography just enriches the experience. No shaky camera (although i don't mind of it) - it's really rare thing to see a war movie shoot in old fashioned way. Sound design is also outstanding - there is simply not one weak point in this movie (well there is one actually with the definitely fake baby, which kinda distracts for a moment, but it's a to minor complain. There is a lot of down to reality action, there is a good and solid drama, and it's a war biopic that shows its central hero from child till his last days.Overall, 'American Sniper' is a superb movie. It tells interesting story and although it's nothing groundbreaking original, but everything here is done so well that you will be glued to your screens during the whole movie. All in all, this is a great movie.",10,18,34,26 May 2015
Lion," Powerful and Unforgettable
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Lion' (2016) is definitely one of the most involving and powerful stories done in 2016. What is the most amazing thing is that this is a true story. Its not hard to imagine kinds being lost now and especially back then in India, but its hard to imagine a more deeply moving coming back home story of one of those lost kids. I was involved into this movie more then i could imagine even i knew it was nominated for 6 Oscars. The storytelling here is magnificent. Directing by Garth Davis and writing by Luke Davies and Saroo Brierley himself was amazing - deeply moving, superbly paced and involving. Acting was top notch from everyone involved, and if there was one moment during the whole running time almost 2 hours that i thought 'it was done mainly for Oscar bait' and this is Nicole Kidman monologue about her childhood nevertheless everyone shined in this movie especially Dev Patel, Priyanka Bose, Nicole Kidman and Sunny Pawar (as Young Saroo).Overall, 'Lion' is definitely a movie that should be seen by everyone. It tells a true, powerful and deeply moving story about how you should never give up on hope of searching. Great movie.",10,0,0,11 August 2017
The Lost City of Z," Great Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Lost City of Z' (2016) took me totally by surprise - a very pleasant surprise. I did not expected much from this movie, but what i got to see is one the best movies from 2016 which i saw only now. Shame on my for missing this movie on a big screen back in the day.'The Lost City of Z' is not a commercial movie to begging with. The story here is kinda slow, and seemingly there aren't many 'involving adventures'. But this is a movie which literally transported me into the time and location. And what a haunting, harsh, beautiful and bold this world was.Directing was simply amazing. At running time 2 h and 15 min i wished this movie lasted longer (seriously). Setting were simply real. Acting by great - this has to be the best performance by Charlie Hunnam yet. Robert Pattinson totally disappeared into the role - its one of his very best - great two lead performances.Overall, 'The Lost City of Z' is kinda old fashioned movie about journey, discoveries and everything in between. It is superbly crafted, amazingly acted and sometimes very haunting journey into unknown. Its also sadly one of the most underrated and overlooked movies in resent memory. Great movie.",10,0,0,15 November 2017
Southpaw," Formulaic yet very entertaining movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Southpaw' (2015) is a movie which you basically already have seen if you ever saw 'Rocky' or another boxing movie in style of 'Rocky' (and not a 'Raging Bull' or 'Million Dollar Baby' which are a ten times better then 'Southpaw' ). Nevertheless i was involved in this movie during the whole 2 hours, it wasn't boring for a second, it is superbly acted - Jake Gyllenhaal is simply superb in here and Forest Whitaker could receive Golden Globe nomination (this is the kind of role that looks like modeled specifically for some award). The movie is superbly paced (Antoine Fuqua is a great director), script is simple yet intriguing and very engaging. There are some emotional moments, and overall tone is also very satisfying. Overall, 'Southpaw' isn't Oscar material, but it is definitely worth your time and money. Ending is predictable by a mile, but it arrives to it on a very satisfying and entertaining road.",9,0,0,11 October 2015
Ant-Man," Nice flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.While premise of 'Ant-Man' (2015) is beyond absurdity, it is quite entertaining flick. While movie is good, i can go with any premise or story, no matter how ridiculous it might sound, and 'Ant-Man' is no exception.I don't read comics and i'm not a fan of Marvel movies, although have seen them all. That said 'Ant-Man' isn't surprising or original like 'Guardians of the Galaxy' by far, but it is nicely made flick. Special effects were good, action is your usual Marvel stuff when things gets blow up but nobody except for villains don't die. Acting was OK by all involved, but nothing serious. On the other hand it just can't be serious when you are playing in Marvel universe movie - no one will ever win Oscar for performance in Marvel movies - it just not meant to happen because of the formula and material. This is why i consider any minute of 'The Dark Knight' trilogy better by many moons in comparison to best stuff from Marvel movies. Overall, this flick is very nicely paced so at the running time 1 h 45 min it does not drag. It is also has some humour mostly from coming from the best comic relief currently in business Michael Peña (will he ever will have some serious roles?). It is very easy movie best enjoyed with bunch of friends.",8,0,2,29 November 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)' was a really good origins movie. Its fun, entertaining, well written, solidly acted and directed. This movie was involving from start till finish. Later it kinda spent into a series of its own, and while this one isn't the best in the series, its a very enjoyable movie on its own.Overall, 'The First Avenger' is a solid entertainment. Its not the best in the series, but i liked it for what it was - a fun and good entertainment.",9,0,0,25 December 2018
Incendies," Powerful Story
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Incendies' (2010) strength lies in its powerful and hardly forgettable story, which at the end left me speechless - literally. This movie is also wonderfully crafted - cinematography was amazing, it should have been nominated for Oscar in that category. Acting was good, especially by the lead who played Nawal Marwan. Directing was very solid by now famous Denis Villeneuve - he was a great guide in this at first kinda tough story. There are many names and places in this movie, but what matters most is what it tells at the end, which i definitely won't even hint at. Sure, the coincidence is one in a million, but this is a movie, and a very powerful one.Overall, 'Incendies' is a highly recommended drama / mystery / war. It has very solid movie craftsmanship, but its biggest strength is the story - a hardly forgettable one.",9,2,4,13 September 2016
Predator," 27 years later it's still rocks
","Greetings from Lithuania.Gona be short here, you all have probably seen this film, many times, so just wanted to throw my two cents - it's a genre classic. Everything works in this film, effects, characters, atmosphere. Ye, the atmosphere is so good in this movie, you always feel tension, it always there. This movie has aged so well, it's better then the first Terminator, and on two Arnies best movies ever (after T2). The creature is unforgettable example of effects, S.Winstons best. Hope nobody will ever try to remake it - it would be an assault to classic. Watch it again, it rocks.",10,0,1,27 March 2014
Nightcrawler," Involving and provocative
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Nightcrawler' (2014) is a very good movie. The central performance is very solid, so as the supporting cast. Directing, script are great, and the cinematography is amazing. 'Nightcrawler' tells kinda fresh and provocative tale about todays need to get information at any cost and it wasn't approached from this side before. The ending maybe wasn't as good as the rest of the movie, but at running time 1 h 50 min i enjoyed this movie very much overall. It's expertly crafted, very well paced and keep you involved during the whole picture.And regarding the famous Oscar nomination snub for the lead role - i think it was very good performance, but it had 50/50 chances to be nominated. With this kinda acting skill, i'm pretty sure he will get one eventually.",9,4,6,1 February 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," OK flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' (2016) is kinda OK and not a bad attempt to mock some current days superstars (J.Bieber especially). It is a not bad comedy and ... nothing more. As the story itself you probably have seen many times in better movies then this, this one has many famous superstars cameos, some a bit extended. Music is lame, as it was targeted to be (but that is the kind of music that is unfortunately dominates today's TOPs.Overall, 'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' is a pretty OK flick for one evening with some friends and maybe some light alcohol involved. Don't' take it to seriously, its OK flick for seeing it once.",7,0,1,18 October 2016
Léon: The Professional," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Léon' (1994) is essentially a movie with everything working so well that you might forgive it's lunatic plot and enjoy for what it is - a movie. The plot is like a fairytale for adults, that would never happen in real life, and there aren't people who live like Leon, nor there are 12 years old girls who can come armed with two weapons into police headquarters with main goal to kill a detective. But this is a movie for god-sake, and a great one it is.It is very sentimental, but that is just one of the parts that makes it's unique and unforgettable. Character are drawn very sharp in here and we start to care for both lead from the opening sequence of them together - that is because of performances, great and simple script and wonderful chemistry between two leads - this is still i think one of the very best performances by Natalie Portman. Directing, cinematography are great, with some clearly visible style and mood trough the film, which makes it feel like a unique - still.Overall, 'Léon' is great action film with lots of well made sentiments. Performances are amazing by all three actors (Oldman including), but it's Natalie who steals the show. Add craftsmanship which creates this unique style, simple but sharp script and tons of sentimental moments (but not to much) and a bit coming of age story and you will get a mix of superb motion picture, a true fairytale for adults. This is a great picture. Still.",10,3,4,2 November 2015
Oblivion," Good, but not great.
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Oblivion' is a good Sci-Fi, action adventure movie. Tom Cruse is good, but you don't see passion in his eyes, the one you saw n Mission Impossible I and III. The story is what keeps this movie going, and it's a good one - for a real Sci-Fi lovers. Althrow it borrows from many others movies like 'Matrix', 'WALL-E' and so on, but hey, do you really see that much of original stories these days? No. But 'Oblivion' has one - not the most original, but a really good one. Effects are very good, but they are not the essential thing in this film - the story is. Overall, if you like Sci-Fi - action stories, \which contains good special effects and a good story even if not the most original one - 'Oblivion' is not to be missed.",9,1,3,31 July 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," This movie and music won me over
","Greetings from Lithuania.I'm not the biggest fan of 'Queen' and after reading some mixed and even many negative reviews from critics (and from some of my favorites), i was skeptical about this picture before watching it - i thought it will be over hyped movie. But this movie won me over. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018) is a great peace of entertainment. Its superbly paced - at running time 2 h 8 min this movie never dragged for a second. Second thing - it is very involving, because of superbly simple yet involving script, great directing (as i said - terrific pacing), great production values during the third act end of the movie and superb performance by Rami Malek - he owned the movie.Overall, its hard not to start singing along during the final act of this movie. And its hard not like this movie overall - its a great peace of entertainment.",9,0,1,10 March 2019
Bird Box," Amazing
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Bird Box' (2018) was an amazing movie. If you like this so called genre type of 'something terrible happens / the end of the world' movies, or you simply like a great intense thrillers - 'Bird Box' will leave you breathless - at least it left me. I loved pretty much everything about this movie - simple yet great and not that predictable story, superb directing (the movie is terrifically paced and very intense) and amazing acting by Sandra Bullock - that is her best performance since 'Gravity' in my opinion - she was truly amazing.Overall, 2018 gave us two movies of this so called genre which are among the very best in this genre, 'A Quiet Place' and now 'Bird Box' - both have similarities, but both movie were just great. To sum it up - 'Bird Box' is in my opinion one of the best movie from 2018. I loved every single minute of it. Great movie.",10,1,8,12 January 2019
Baby Driver," Fresh and original take on the heist movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Baby Driver' (2017) does not have an original nor very fresh plot, but its the execution that makes this movie really work. While writing by Edgar Wright here and there wasn't very involving (but nevertheless very good overall), its directing were he truly shined with this movie. This film is heavily stylized, with superb music soundtrack. Music was very important to 'Baby Driver' and they superbly implemented good songs into it. Acting here by everyone was solid, although no awards for acting will shine in here. And then there are few chase sequences - done so good! The first chase sequence simply puts to shame every Fast and Furious movie in this decade. Overall, 'Baby Driver' is a really good and fresh take on heist movies. While the plot isn't original, this sometimes very bold movie created situations like I've not seen in some time. Good movie overall.",9,1,3,1 October 2017
Justice League," Hopefully their solo movies will be better then this empty mess
","Greetings from Lithuania.As the one who really enjoyed 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' as well as 'Wonder Woman' i found this movie pretty flat, unfortunately. Why do superhero movies these days have to have stuff like 'orbs', 'cubs' 'keys' and similar devises of doomsday which are very stupid, childish and just lame. Boy oh boy how i miss movies like 'The Dark Knight' or 'Batman Begins', where on the center were characters, their actions and consequences - not fucxxx orbs, cubs, keys and similar toys!Overall, 'Justice League' is the kinda movie which just splashes before your eyes and vanishes from your memory the second credits start rolling. There is nothing that will keep you from seeing it once. I think its about time they should very seriously consider to change Zack Snyder into someone with more fresh vision.",6,1,3,28 May 2018

","Greetings from Lithuania.This movie is in my brains. This movie is in my soul. This movie is in my heart.'Armageddon' is a movie of my childhood. I watched it with my friends for about 20 times 10 years ago. Two of my friends have died now. I remembering them when i watch this movie now, it's timeless, best fun movie ever, and i cry every time i see it. And it's giving me so much tears every time i watch this one, it's just GREAT, unforgettable piece of the most unrealistic, spectacular popcorn movie EVER.'Armageddon' - you have to see this one.",10,18,30,12 August 2011
The Village," Good atmospheric thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Village' (2004) was probably the last good movie from M. Night Shyamalan, after near masterpiece 'The Sixth Sense', and terrific movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. It is not as good as those three movies, but it's a damn good atmospheric / drama thriller with some twists along the way. There are couple of twists in this movie, and watching this movie back in 2004 in cinema (i was a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan at that moment) i was hugely disappointed by first twist, but the second (and last) was amazing - didn't see that coming for sure. Acting is good in this movie, with Bryce Dallas Howard best performance (period) and strong supportive acting by the great Joaquin Phoenix. The whole cast is great in here, and although not everyone received opportunity to shine, they all did a pretty good job in my opinion. Direting is good, but movie drags a bit there and there mainly because of script - it is good but inconsistent.The best part of this movie is in its atmosphere, which is created beautifully here (superb sound design (picture has to be seen with the best possible sound system) and good cinematography). There are some great suspenseful scenes as well - kudos to great direction in those scenes.Overall, 'The Village' has problems with pacing, but overall experience is very positive. It's best parts are not in conversations (which drags a bit due to script), but in overall mood and some great suspenseful scenes as well as feeling that something isn't right in here and question 'who or what is behind this all'. When all questions will be answered, some of them are very disappointing, but most of them will force you re-think and probably re-watch this movie twice - and it is worth seeing it more than once (but two times will be definitely enough).",8,1,2,8 September 2015
The Revenant," Raw, brutal yet breathtakingly beautiful epic
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Revenant' (2015) is in my opinion the best movie of 2015. 'Spotlight' was very good, yet 'The Revenant' is more visceral experience, one of the kind actually - once seen this movie is hard to forget. Cinenamtography by the great Emmanuel Lubezki was breathtaking - he just delivers viewer to the place and time - 'The Revenant' has to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Directing was amazing, and the overall craftsmanship of this movie is simply stunning. And yes, the bear attack scene is brutal and unforgiving - how did they done that? And yet i don't really think that Leonardo DiCaprio was such a sure Oscar winner. His performance is very good in here, he surely got trough a lot during filming, but is that what best performance is all about? The only reason he won is that there weren't really strong contenders last year, given any other year in the past, he wouldn't won.Overall, 'The Revenant' is a great movie, but can be a disappointment for those who are looking for some adventure flick. It has some spirituality themes along, and it's not very easy to sit trough this long 2 h 35 min movie - but it's a damn worth every minute of it.",9,1,2,10 April 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Entertaining, yet forgettable flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Trouble with the Curve' is fun, entertaining flick while it lasts, and after it, you won't really remember what happened. Acting is very OK, but the only reason i watched this is only because of Clint Eastwood who, lets admit it, is an absolute film legend. Who doesn't like Clint Eastwood? He didn't win an Oscar, but thats not a problem, everyone knows him and respects as an actor and a filmmaker, he could not wish for more. And he's very cool here, as usual - you believe that he is a scout legend - that is what Eastwood usually brings with him. As a film, 'Trouble with the Curve' is a fun nicely done flick + Clint Eastwood = solid entertainment (althrough kinda forgettable).",8,2,3,2 July 2014
Bridge of Spies," Excellent movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Bridge of Spies' is a superb movie. Not only based on a very true events in a kinda complicated times and situations, it highly entertainingly and clearly tells and shows this story - leave it to Steven Spielberg to make an entertaining movie about not very entertaining things. I won't go into the details but the plot is very involving and the movie itself is very absorbing, with no good / bad sides - it kinda even inspirational one.About the acting - all involved were very good, but there is one exception. Mark Rylance. THIS is the very best acting i saw in a 2015 movie so far. Give my all movie about his Rudolf Abel - i couldn't take my eyes off him - EVERY scene he is in he steals it. His face expression, eyes, talk, the way he smokes and everything - this is the Best Supporting Acting from 2015 - sorry Stallone, as much i enjoyed 'Creed' and your acting - Mark Rylance more deserves an Oscar in upcoming awards - 'stoykij muzyk!' Overall, 'Bridge of Spies' is very good movie on all accounts. It is a bit maybe to Hollywodical' here and there, but this is a highly involving movie and superbly crafted movie which takes place in seemingly forgotten time. Filled with very good performances and one exceptional, this is an excellent movie.",10,0,3,2 February 2016
Split," Intense and very well made thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.So just before the very end of 'Split' (2016), a movie by M. Night Shyamalan that i haven't had enjoyed this far since well, maybe 'Signs' back in 2002, i kinda thought that there won't be a any twist at the end (kinda even can't remember times where a movie by this director was an event film) - but i was surprised more then i could imagine after i heard a very familiar and great theme back from a very good director's movie back in 2000 and the there was HE! No spoiler - but count me in for any sequels from this 'universe'.Now back to the 'Split' - i did enjoyed this movie a lot. This is a tense, involving and intriguing thriller where once my favorite M. Night Shyamalan is on his good form - writing was good, dark and involving - its like non of those shxx movies before have ever happened (and you know what movies i do refer). Acting was very strong by James McAvoy and good by Anya Taylor-Joy. Directing was solid - the movie is intense, good / dark looking and moody thriller. Overall, hopefully M. Night Shyamalan has returned to the form for which i enjoyed his movies A LOT (to say the least) in the past and he will stay with it. 'Split' is a proof of this - an involving, intense and just a good thriller.",8,6,19,17 April 2017
North by Northwest," Highly enjoyable but far from realistic thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.'North by Northwest' (1959) is more like an adventure with some mystery and thriller elements than a real thriller - it has this lightness that separates it from more serious approach of the material. And maybe that's is the strangeness and at the same time the weakness of this great and exciting movie. It is superbly photographed, features splendid cinematography (the scene with the plane in the fields is simply amazing, still after first time seeing this movie in 2015). Acting is very solid but not very serious, you won't believe for a second that one of the characters were experiencing a real peril, it is more like acting in front of the camera, not 'beeing there sort of acting'. While the story is intriguing at first, it becomes more or less intriguing by the end, and although i really enjoyed the last sequence on the monument, some acting in there weren't just that good or realistic. Overall, 'North by Northwest' is a definitely a great movie, but more of its parts are great that the whole. It has great comedic moments, especially by Cary Grant. Eva Marie Saint is more powerful in dramatic scenes rather that in action scenes, she isn't convincing in those, she is dramatic actress, not an action heroines. Directing is solid here (by legendary Alfred Hitchcock!). 'North by Northwest' is very enjoyable movie and i absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of movies, and while the individual scenes are almost brilliant, the movie as a whole isn't as brilliant as the sum of it's parts.",9,1,3,28 September 2015
"I, Robot"," Good action, sci-fi thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.'I, Robot' (2004) is still one of the best action vehicles of Will Smith. This is a smart, involving, exciting sci-fi thriller, with good high concept story, great special effects and good acting by all involved. I starts as a futuristic detective story and becomes much more, although it doesn't go very deep, still this is a movie were story is at it's center, and the comes special effects, not another way around.Overall, one day there is definitely should be a sequel to this movie. Complex story and with special effects of this era - sequel could be terrific. If you still haven't seen this movie, you should definitely check it out - it's a very good entertainment.",8,0,1,5 August 2016

","Greetings from Lithuania.'We're the Millers' is definitely the best comedy of this year, and i liked the 'Heat'. I'm not the fan of Jennifer Aniston, but she's quite good in this one. Many things work in this comedy, and i laughed very hard - and that is a rate thing. Jason Sudeikis (who's last name is Lithuania'n)is very good in this one, actually, everyone involved in this flick did a strong job. One thing i really liked about this comedy, that jokes aren't unnatural (hope you know what i mean), they are very natural and that's why they work an are funny. Overall, this is a very good R rated comedy. Beware - it's really R.",9,0,1,7 November 2013
Apocalypse Now," Masterpiece
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Apocalypse Now' (1979) is to simply put - a true movie masterpiece. There isn't anything new that can say in a praise for this movie. This is one of a few best war movies ever made, and this is simply one of the top 5 movies ever made. I don'e even know where should i start to praise this movie. This movie is probably one of the cases where you not only 'love it' or 'hate it' - 'Apocalypse Now' won't leave anyone, and by anyone i mean casual or true movie buff in some way 'unmoved' - it has everything (well maybe except for a love story- but save that for a 'Director's Cut'). 'Apocalypse Now' is in some sort a 'road movie'. It is also a 'war movie'. It is also a 'finding yourself' or even 'coming of age story'. It is about finding a true horror in surrounding of nature, and how this horror becomes part of you. But no matter the way in which you will see this masterpiece - one thing is clear - it is simply one of the best movies ever made. Overall, i saw the original cut like 3 or 4 times, and 2 times 'Director's Cut'. For all rookies of 'Apocalypse Now' I would recommend the original cut first, and after this masterpiece will become a part of your mind, then you can see 'Director's Cut' - it is a deeper road into a rabbit hole.",10,0,2,20 May 2016
Divergent," Superb entertainment
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Divergent' (2014) is a superb entertainment. I haven't read the book, but i was hooked from the beginning till the very last end. Shailene Woodley gives a great performance for this kind of movie, you simply can not resist for rotting for her. Other actors did a descent job for the material. 'Divergent' which is based on a book is type of the movies that i call '21 th century movie adaptations Beverly Hils style' - it's all actually a bit familiar for this type of movies, aka. 'The Host' (2013), 'The Hunger Games' franchise - you get the structure, and there is always a hero (a heroine)which isn't like all other, and she starts a rebellion - no spoilers here. But 'Divergent' is better then 'The Host', and it's better than the first 'The Hunger Games' film.Overall, if like these adaptations, you will definitely will love 'Divergent', which is wonderfully paste, good acted, solidly written and to sum it up, it's a great entertainment.",10,2,8,10 August 2014
Ender's Game," Not bad for one viewing
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Ender's Game' (2013) is enjoyable movie for seeing it once, once you have done with it, you won't be having a need to return to it. The premise is kinda absurd, so just go with it, don't think much. Visuals are pretty good in here, and there a lot of them. Sound effects aren't memorable, but cinematography and editing are not bad at all. Acting is OK, nothing special. Ben Kingsley seems to accepting every possible role these days, and lets just say this isn't the most bizarre of them. He is just a paycheck actor with an Oscar on his list these days.Overall, 'Ender's Game' is enjoyable movie for one time. It is a Sci-Fi drama. The ending kinda sucked in my opinion. It is not the best not the worst movie, should do it for one boring evening.",7,0,1,16 August 2015
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," R rating saves this flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' (2013) is mindless fun. Leave your brain at the door or turn it off before watching this flick, because it's so stupid but altogether so clever and fun that you will definitely will like it.It's not the recreation of the famous fairy tale, but more like and our days mainstream fun for Jerry Bruckheimer fans. It is fun, it has some clever moments especially with production design and some gadgets or tool that represents these days tools with old fairy tales spin. But one of the most important things why this mindless flick works is R rating. Without it this movie would have become a big flop.Overall, 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' is a fun those who wan't to have some fun while watching a movie while doesn't taking it to serious.",8,0,0,11 April 2015
Dreamgirls," Easy to watch, but hard to get involved
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Dreamgirls' (2006) is the kinda of a movie which is easy watchable, but its hard to get involved or really to care about the plot. Its a very good looking movie with tons of great performances (with singing, i mean), great sound and etc. On the other hand i wasn't involved into the story itself. Its kinda bin there, saw that type of movie in every scene.Overall, 'Dreamgirls' is not a bad movie by any means, but its not a great one either for sure. While production values are really good, its hard to be involved into the story.",6,2,4,21 October 2018
In the Name of the Father," Powerful picture
","Greetings from LIthuania.'In the Name of the Father' (1993) is powerful picture. Superbly acted, directed and written, this is one of those pictures you won't shake it of easily after seeing it. No, it's not gruesome of gory, but at times it's disturbing in showing us the reality. The situation that these people have faced is not an enviable. I haven't heard about this case in real life, and i somehow don't believe that everything that was shown in this movie happened in reality just like this, but it's a dramatization of the events, and it's an amazing one. Overall, a solid 10/10 for 'In the Name of the Father' - amazing acting, very involving autobiographical story, great directing - this is a must see.",10,0,2,12 October 2014
Face_Off," One of the most memorable actions films ever
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Face/Off' is a terrific action flick. It has ingenious plot, terrific action, great acting by two lead, and again, great action sequences, created by J.Woo himself. This is the best J.Woo's film of his carrier, and i know has made some great action flicks back home, but i think 'Face/Off' is his crowning achievement.By the way, last time when i was re watching this flick, i have noticed some goofs in the film, one of the is very clearly visible - how could they leave cables around the guy who N.Cages character (the evil one) blasts with the shotgun in the first shootout, is beyond me.Nevertheless, 'Face/Off' is probably unforgettable action classic, which with the help of simple and ingenious plot ranks among the best action flicks ever. Yes, it's that good.",10,1,2,1 July 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Fun and entertaining adventure
","Greetings from Lithuania.As a big fan of the franchise i can safely say - 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' (2015) is very solid entry into the series after (in my opinion) weakest part 'Ghost Protocol'. Finally there are gunfights, not overdone action sequences in some kind of super location. If 'Ghost Protocol' is the most visually stunning but most flat on simple tension entry then 'Rogue Nation' is back on track.Acting is everything you can expect in the series (which means everyone in they uniformly good form), with one exception - Rebecca Ferguson steals the show with this sometimes fragile but one the same time though (as Ethan) and deadly spy. Action sequences are very good (and over the top as expected), with underwater sequence that steals the show - great stuff. Overall, while not the best in the series (that title goes to III part in my opinion), this is a very solid entry to the series, wishing be to see more installments in the franchise.",8,0,1,22 December 2015
Collateral," Great thriller as well as great character study movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Collateral' (2004) serves as a very good thriller as well as good character study movie. There are two characters are its core, and they are both very interesting due to great performances and very good script.First time i saw 'Collateral' back in a year of its release. Second time was today. 16 years ago i rated it 9/10 on this page. Today, 16 years later, i would rate it same - great movie from one of my all time favorite Michael Mann. Yet this time i saw faced i did not notice 16 years ago: Mr. Mark Ruffalo & Mr. Javier Bardem - two of the greats in a supporting roles here, you can see why these actors year later went to the top.Overall, 'Collateral' is the only movie were you will see T.Cruse in a villain role. Or isn't a villain? Listening to him, you kinda starting to doubt. What a great script and great performances in a very good movie.",9,0,2,20 May 2020
Dark City," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Dark City' (1998) is a definitely a movie that every sci-fi lover must see - at least once. The story is the star of this movie and add here a great movie making - 'Dark City' blow my mind back in 1999 the first time i saw it. Now i revisited it just for the second time, and this time i watched it the director's cut. This is a visionary movie to begin with. The story itself was mind blowing back in the day when it was created - there was no 'Matrix' and other similar movies back then, so you have to give a big kudos to creators to making this bold idea into a story and executing it at its best. Set design is astonishing, special effects serves the story, not other way around and script is great - it is not the most involving movie i've ever seen and you have to love sci-fi in general to truly appreciate this movie, but writer did a superb job in showing this world piece by piece.Overall, 'Dark City' truly will stand out the test of time and will be considered as one of the best sci-fi movies around. It has great, brilliant idea and its execution is one of the kind. This is not a mainstream popcorn sci-fi - this one plays with ideas of such as 'what makes us human after all?'. It is a one helluva movie.",9,2,4,17 September 2016
Dunkirk," Amazingly Crafted War Thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.First of all - 'Dunkirk' (2017) is not the best war film ever made in my opinion. By far. I don't think that there ever will be a better war movies then 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) or even 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), 'Platoon' (1986) or 'The Thin Red Line' (1998). It is not even the best Christopher Nolan movie at the moment (the crown goes to 'Interstellar (2014)). That said, 'Dunkirk' IS something absolutely unique, stunning, kinda mesmerizing movie going experience. It is not perfect, sometimes even a bit confusing (because of the time lines, but its not 'overdone') movie, but the one which HAS to be seen in a movie theater.The best thing about 'Dunkirk' is the craftsmanship and the biggest star of 'Dunkirk' is without a doubt Christopher Nolan THE director. The script in here is not a great one, and like i said i was a bit confused at some moments, but the story here is so powerful itself that it tells everything. Music is simply astonishing. Hans Zimmer (again) does something absolutely unique with Nolan movie - it transcendence the whole experience. Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is a masterpiece. Sound design and sound mixing are so good, so sharp that it adds more to this movie then just a sound - it makes you kinda grab your seat. So here are the 4 Oscar nominations here for sure - best director, music, cinematography (probably a winner) and sounds (sure winners). Acting was good given the roles, but nothing very memorable except for a great Mark Rylance and Fionn Whitehead which i really liked in this role. Overall, 'Dunkirk' is not a bloody or gore war movie. Its 'horror' is terror. The situation and how it is presented in this movie made me think couple of times about the war that this is a true terror. This is not an 'easy' movie going experience because you have to pay attention during a whole movie and it doesn't have sharp characters to which you can relate - its about a situation at the moment - right here right now. There are 'time line' sections / intersections that makes you think about what you are seeing. And it is done so unique, so ambitious that i probably haven't witnessed this kinda movie before. its not a mainstream 'war movie', basically its a thriller set in a WW2. But its crafted so uniquely that it can not be missed. A sure classic, if not for everyone.",10,1,12,21 July 2017
Aliens," There will never be the same 'ALIENS' again...
","Greetings from Lithuania.What can i say about this movie that wasn't told hundreds time before. Excellent. This is the only word that can describe this movie. Excellent direction. Excellent acting. Excellent camera work, editing. Breathtaking (still!) special visual, sound effects. Unforgettable hero! The best of the decade. The best in its genre. Every time you watch it gets better and better. The atmosphere and suspension will never be the same again. EVERYTHING in this movie works brilliant! My favorite director J. Cameron created the timeless masterpiece. Bill Paxton really deserved an Oscar nomination that year. One of my favorite five motion pictures ever. And it will stay there forever...Overwhelming masterpiece.",10,19,27,13 March 2008
The Exorcist," The Greatest And The Best Horror Movie Ever Made
","Greetings from Lithuania.To start with - i love horror movies in general. I love the very genre itself. Its my favorite genre along with SCI-FI and great dramas. I do watch A LOT of horror movie. I'm seeing horror movies even if they are at their minimum required budgets, no matter how poor he flick is. You do cry when watching dramas. You are being carried away when watching a great SCI-FI movie. But horror is the only genre that puts something literally into you. Leaves some marks. It is not easy to 'put' them away.'The Exorcist' (1973) is the ONLY horror movie that literally scarred my as a human being to the core. Not as a movie-goer, when you see a good or poor horror movies, which scares you, and after seeing it you kinda go to bathroom after it done with lights on and you are saying 'it was only a movie'. The one and only 'The Exorcist' scared me to the bones.I do not know were to start in praising this movie. The plausible and realistic 'down to the ground' world it shows adds to the overall experience. The way it all starts, its just mind blowing. The things it shows, the way this movie shows it, is better then anything i have ever witnessed in his genre, and i'm a pro in his genre. Acting is simply perfect. This movie never, ever uses a scene for genuine scare just to show it - like 'oh it was just a cat' and something like it - its build in its atmosphere, and its greatest strength lies in it. Directing was perfect. script is beyond good. And all the make-up effects adds to the realism - its not just a monster acting around - it is a pure human being caught in a nightmare, which you are witnessing along.Overall, i could write a book a bout this movie, but to be as short as possible - this is the best horror movie ever made, and this i'm saying as a genuine horror movie fan. Everything works in this experience, no way to say it somehow else. A pure movie, a pure terror.",10,1,1,22 September 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Good and fans will love it
","Greetings from Lithuania.'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014) is very solid flick, with a big budget and even bigger stars it delivers what it promises. It's a very good X-Men movie, but for me, not as good as 'X-Men: First Class'. Settings, special effects are great, you can clearly see that lots of effort was put into making of this movie. Don't have to say anything more actually.Overall, 8/10 for 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', a very solid, entertaining X-Men flick, with one slow motion standout sequence which you will want to see many times.",8,0,1,11 October 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Truly a superb entertainment
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) is the best movie in this franchise since the first 'Iron Man' and with the exception of exceptional 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Finally there was a story that was in a first place, and then the action, which was simply - amazing. Fight scenes and special effects were amazing to say the least. Stunts were superb as well. Craftmenship is as good as these movies gets - 250 mill. dollars surely were spent wisely. Finally there were a consequences of the action which i looked forward since the first Avangers - what about thousand if not million who died during these movies - so great that it was finally questioned here (maybe a bit to late but it's better then never).Overall, 'Captain America: Civil War' is just a superb entertainment which kept me glued to the screen during the whole 2 h 5 min. And you better find the biggest screen possible if you missed it during theatrical run, cause this is a blast.",10,2,11,5 September 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Better then i thought it will be
","Greetings from Lithuania.I never was a big fan of 'Harry Potter' series, but i liked all of the movies. Those were kinda better then 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' (2016) - in my opinion. That said i never intended to see 'Fantastic Beasts', but yet i did finally at at the end i wasn't disappointing, but that is because i didn't expect much. It has a lot and good special effects, but not that special. Set design was very good as well all of production design. Yet the movie dragged, not much but at running time 2 h 5 min it could have been a bit shorter. Overall, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is not a bad movie at the end, i wasn't disappointing. I will check the sequel, maybe some time after it will come out.",7,0,0,4 September 2018
The Conjuring 2," As good as the great original
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Conjuring 2' (2016) for me was probably the best horror movie i've seen since, well... 'The Conjuring'. Try to skip all trailers and watch this movie in a movie theater - it's a truly one scary and superbly crafted ride. James Wan is definitely a horror movie pro - he knows the genre very well and delivers everything you would expect from this kind of flick and more, much more. Just take the ending scene - you won't expect this kind of closing (no spoilers) scene after all the horror we witnessed during the whole 2 h 15 min. superbly paced ride - a scene which will definitely generate some applauding from audience (at least in my local theater it did). Or take the one were Patrick Wilson character 'interogates / talks' with the possessed girl with everyone including him turned away from here - it is a long, one shoot - killer scene.Overall, 'The Conjuring 2' was better then i expected it to be. I loved the first movie, witch wasn't perfect, but was a great horror movie. Before attending the screening i had doubts that they probably won't achieve the success of the first movie. I was wrong. It is as good as the original. It is superb sequel in all directions. 'The Conjuring' franchise THIS quality is very welcomed.",9,0,1,11 June 2016
Inside Out," Best Pixar movie in many moons
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Inside Out' (2015) is simply amazing motion picture experience. I do call it motion picture because although it's animated, few animated movies had ever reached the dept and multi-layered story as 'Inside Out'. The story is very simple here, but it's just on a surface. You have to keep your attention during the whole ride and catching all small details, because this movie perfectly shows how does emotions control over human's mind, how one can not exist without another or how joy can co-exist with sadness. 'Inside Out' has also reminded my 'Inseption'. Altgough on a surface they are very different, down deep both of their stories are based on human conciseness.Overall, 'Inside Out' is extremely smart, involving, superbly voiced ('sadness' voice steals the show), beautifully animated and multi-layered story for young and adults. It is sometimes very funny, with some small but memorable movie inside jokes (aka. 'forget it Jake, this is 'Cloud' town') and touching as well. Hands down this is the best Pixar movie in many, many years.",10,5,29,1 December 2015
Die Hard 2," Great action movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Die Hard 2' (1990) is a pure action classic. Its not the best in a series, but its highly entertaining, involving and impressive action movie all around. It has simple yet great premise, terrific action sequences, good dialog, very solid acting by all involved and great directing.Overall, as there isn't anything new to say about this pure action classic, if you haven't seen it in a wile, you can do it, as this movie barely has aged. Great movie.",10,0,1,24 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Big, funny, entertaining and sad for those who are invested into this series
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Avengers: Endgame' (2019) was funny, a bit sad, very entertaining, spectacular and maybe a bit too long for me personally. I did enjoy this movie from start till finish though, and while its not my personal favorite from them all, this was a very solid movie in my opinion (and i'm not a huge fan of these movies to start with, so tears haven't been found during my watch).Overall, 'Avengers: Endgame' brings half of the Hollywood famous actors into one big, entertaining 3 hours (!) long escapism. At the end i enjoyed this film much more then i thought i will be.",9,5,14,25 April 2019
Independence Day," A mainstream movie classic
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Independence Day' (1996) is true classic. Good plot, terrific special effects, great action scenes, lots of heroes - it has it all to be called a classic. Sadly, i haven't had a possibility to enjoy it on the big screen at the time, i believe it was a blast off. It started Will Smith who at the time wasn't a big star, and it proved, that this man can save the world. Needles to say, this is probably the best film of Roland Emmerich, other pictures, who i enjoyed very much didn't come to this stuff. A film that still has a great look, great special effects, and it can take you the place that only movies can.",9,1,2,10 August 2014
Alien vs. Predator," Not bad if you are a die hard fan of either of these franchises
","Greetings from Lithuania.'AVP: Alien vs. Predator' (2004) is not bad movie if you are a fan of one of the franchises. If you are not - for you it will be just another slasher with a twist - it has monsters instead of people.I remember i had high hopes for this movie upon it's release back in 2004, i saw this movie in a theater and it wasn't a big disappointment because it has these two iconic monsters in one movie and there were some nice Easter egg left for fans. What it did lack was a sharply written characters - this was one of the reasons why first two movies in both franchises did worked - there were people, not just caricatures that we did care about.Overall, because you have probably have seen this flick already, there isn't anything new i can say about it. If you are a die hard fan, you can check this one out - it will do just fine for one evening, but if you want a serious movie about 'Aliens' - now you can wait for the upcoming Neill Blomkamp's so fan untitled 'Alien' movie. Now that i hope again (and have all reasons to do that) will be a great movie.",6,1,1,6 April 2015
District 9," Superb
","Greetings from Lithuania.'District 9' is a superb action and sci-Fi thriller. The great Neill Blomkamp superbly directed this picture, of which first 45 min. are mesmerizing. Later this movie becomes action flick, with some 'Transformers' type action all over it. The second half of this movie isn't as good as the first ~45 min. but overall this movie is a superb. Opening plays like a high profile documentary which simply takes you to the place and makes you see things very purely. It is a superb film-making. Overall, i'm giving this movie 10/10 despite the fact that second half of this movie isn't as original and exciting as the opening like 45 min. because overall this is a pure sci-fi done very, very good. It gets rid of all clichés from the beginning, and puts you right there with Wikus Van De Merwe. It's is superb film making by newcomer (then) Neill Blomkamp. Can't wait for his 'Alien' sequel.",10,0,3,1 July 2016
The Fault in Our Stars," Beautiful movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Fault in Our Stars' (2014) is simply beautiful picture. Great acting by all involved, and especially by my favorite star of recent years Shailene Woodley this is an involving picture from start till finish. I didn't found it very predictable, sure, if you are watching a lot pictures, you will now where it's coming, but still i was captivated from start till finish. On it's core this is a romantic picture, with unusual characters. This picture is not about cancer either, it's about embracing your life in every step, no mater what - this is i think is a point of this movie.Overall, flavorless acting especially by both leads (and another standout performance by Shailene Woodley), nice script, refreshing love story and nice drama - this picture is simply a joy to watch, and yes, don't forget to have some handkerchiefs - you will need them, 9/10.",9,0,1,9 September 2014
Non-Stop," Not bad thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.Liam Neeson stars in 'Non-Stop' a mystery thriller flick set up in transatlantic flight. It's not an action aka Die Hard, it's a thriller, mystery with the bad guy being revealed at the enc, and a nice one. Honestly, the way that leads up to the end was much more interesting than the reveal itself - nothing brilliant at the end, but also nothing impossible, well, almost nothing. If you like Liam Neeson post 'Taken' roles aka old, wise, 'bad person' doing good stuff, than you will probably enjoy this flick as well, it's nothing special, but for what it is, it works, and it's a nice escapism with some friends taken along.",8,1,3,28 June 2014
Saving Private Ryan," A true masterpiece
","Greetings from Lithuania.I can not really say anything about 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) that was not said before countless of times. I'm just going to praise it one more time. 'Saving Private Ryan' is a masterpiece of movie-making, it's true. Almost no other war film can't take you to the place like this picture does. 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Saving Private Ryan' are the best war movies ever. Very different, yet very similar on the note of anti-war ideas. Now back to 'Saving Private Ryan'. The opening scene is ... well, you all know, it's a jaw dropping experience, and i mean, experience - for a 20 min you can partly feel what is war and how it was to a soldiers on that day. This scene alone is a excruciating masterpiece. The film settles then in to a journey through hell picture, it still remains unforgettable. No matter how many times you are watching 'Saving Private Ryan', it grabs you from the opening scene and does not let go this the very last image. As i don't think there are people who never saw this film, i can just say, watch it again. It'a a film to remember, and to learn. It'a a masterpiece on all levels.",10,2,3,9 August 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Good but not as great as the first part
","Greetings from Lithuania.'How to Train Your Dragon 2' (2014) is a colorful, big, amazing looking follow up to the one of the best animated movies in a long time. It's visually amazing, and although it doesn't feature anything groundbreaking in visual department, it looks fabulous. The story here is probably were this movie felt a bit for me. It's good, but not engaging as the first one was. 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' expands the universe of the first picture and gives some new characters, but only one of them was interesting - voiced wonderfully by Cate Blanchett. Overall, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is a true big screen experience for almost all ages. It's looks and sound wonderfully, and although the story isn't anything new or special, it's definitely worth seeing. There were moments were i felt this movie dragged a bit in the middle section, but it has one interesting turn of events near the end of the movie that i didn't see coming.",8,1,2,16 February 2015
The Favourite," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Favourite' (2018) is a period costume drama for those who usually do not like period costume dramas. The script, directing and acting were outstanding. The movie, at running time 1 h 55 min never dragged and was involving from start till finish. And the ending, the very last long scene was truly remarkable.Overall, 'The Favourite' is a superb period piece. Its not as good as 'Barry Lyndon', but i enjoyed it more then any other costume period drama in recent memory.",9,4,5,22 April 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Letdown
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' (2011) is a worst movie in this franchise. By saying this, i know i will get a lot of negative thoughts as this movie is ranked the best in the franchise. Please don't get me wrong – it's not a bad movie by any means. Actually, it's the most impressive looking movie if compared to other three. It has gorgeous visuals, top notch settings and heart stopping and jaw dropping sequence with the highest building. Do why do i ranked it weakest in the series? It because of couple of things. First, there is no dread, no suspense in this movie, except for one sequence i already mentioned. Ghost Protocol' became more family friendly and it's not a coincidence that it was released during holiday season movie. Every good action movie has to got good villain, unfortunately Ghost Protocol' lacks a true villain, there is only one Russian general who want's to destroy the world. Really? And i don't even wan't to go into a details of scene in which Tom Cruise enters Kremlin with fake mustache and worst accent ever – it's beyond sci-fi. During the whole movie i wasn't interested in plot or where did main characters were going next – it's how uninvolved this movie was.Overall, 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol' is impressively looking empty auctioneer without a simple treat – it's has cool looking plastic' action scenes and no intrigue at all. This is the most disappointing chapter in of of the best action series ever.",7,1,3,14 December 2014
Foxcatcher," Very solid movie with excellent performances
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Foxcatcher' (2014) is superbly acted biography sport drama based on very true events. The three leading actors were superb, two of them earning Oscar nominations. Mark Ruffalo stole every scene he is in, it's a terrific performance. Overall, 'Foxcatcher' isn't inspirational sport drama. It is based on very true events, so read as less synopsis about this movie as you can before watching it. At running time 2 h 7 min is superbly paced, doesn't drag and is very well directed. Not a typical sports movie, but a very descent film.",9,4,7,22 February 2015
It Follows," Good and kinda original horror picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'It Follows' (2014) has got some really intriguing idea. It's not the most original horror plot, but it will definitely raise a question - 'what would i did in this kind of situation?' - so you can count this one as having a truly kind of original horror movie plot twist.Execution of this plot is also done not in a traditional way. Cinematography is terrific in here - there are some steady and long shoots, there is no shaky camera, so you can always see bright and clear what is going on. Direction, writing are very solid. Music was also very good, and not a traditional horror movie theme. Acting was good, much better than in average horror flick, although no one here will win anything for in acting department.And yet, i'm giving to 'It Follows' 'only' 8/10 - seeing the praises from critics i thought the final rating will be higher. Don't get me wrong - this is an exceptionally well made and kind of original horror picture. It barely drags and is involving from start till finish. But it doesn't grab you as hard as it could have, the premise and execution of it's parts are better then the whole. Nevertheless, this is superbly well crafted horror picture, which in my opinion isn't THAT scary, but it has great mood, great idea, terrific cinematography, great direction. All in all, this is good movie.",8,38,76,4 June 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," What a pleasant surprise!
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was a really good entertainment. It has so much good things, that i actually enjoyed this movie much more that any 'Planet of the Apes' movie put together. And this is the best movie i saw in the last months. Visuals are great. The storytelling is at its best. And motion capture technology is beautifully used. Andy Serkis steals every single scene he is in. Cesar is a wonderfully executed character, you really understand him, love him and feel for him. Hands down, this is probably the best summer movie in 2011. I'm really looking forward to the next movie of this franchise.",10,2,5,20 November 2011
Legend," Entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Legend' (2015) is kinda 'been there saw that' type of crime biopic. Performances were descent by everyone including the brilliant Tom Hardy - he is good in here, playing two roles. It is far from his best performance, but it is a pretty good one and involving. The movie itself is also kinda entertaining. It is not a best gangster drama by far out there, and although at running time 2 h 5 min this movie does drag here and there (especially towards the end with Emily Browning scenes) while it lasted i was entertained. Overall, 'Legend' is definitely a pretty good movie. Good central performance / performances by Tom Hardy and pretty entertaining script makes this movie involving. It is far from anything great in any category, but it is a pretty descent movie.",8,0,1,28 May 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Good movie, but not that great to be on the list of IMDB 250
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018) was a pretty fun and good movie overall. The ending kinda saved it for me to be a 7/10, ending was good and that is why i'm giving this movie 8/10. But i do not believe that it will end eventually the way it ended in this movie, common - there a more bucks needs to made from this universe. That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then 'Terminator 2' or 'Apocalypse Now' - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself.Overall, 'Infinity War' was a good 2 h 20 min escapism, but it suffers pacing issues here and there. At the end i liked this picture and will check the 2nd part as well.",8,4,6,18 August 2018
JFK," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.Wheter or not do you believe the things shown in this movie are true (or at least mostly) - 'JFK' (1991) is a one great movie. First time seen just now in 2016, it kinda blew my away because i didn't expected that director's cut which i've seen, that runs almost 3 h 20 min will be THIS entertaining, involving and provoking at the same time. Cast is probably one of the very best (if not the best) i've ever seen, and while some of them played a bit over the top (J.Pesci), there isn't a weak performance here - that is because of a great director working in his best form. Now i do believe that this Oliver Stone's (who's movies are a bit uneven sometimes but ALWAYS interesting to watch) movie is probably his most ambitious ever, as much as i love 'Platoon' and 'Born on the Fourth of July' and highly admire almost every other (well except for the poor 'Alexander'). Script of 'JFK' is brilliant. Many times watching this movie i asked my self a question - did this really happen or this is a pure fiction? I do not ask these questions in my life often (almost never), as i do not believe in big conspiracies overall (fake moon landing and fantasies of haters in that spirit), but this movie is so superbly written that during the movie and closer by the end i started to have my doubts. I do not honestly know many facts about the killing himself, just as much as probably everyone else, therefore seeing things in 'JFK' made me think otherwise to official story and a theory that was presented by the end by Jim Garrison sounded very, very convincing to me. So who actually killed Mr. Kennedy? Lets leave it to the history.Overall, 'JFK. The Director's Cut' is a superb drama in all directions. At running time 3 h and 20 min (!) it is, hear this - never boring or uninvolving for a second! The pacing (amazing editing), writing and directing are one of the kind and with a cast witch involves almost every well known face in a Hollywood this is a must see movie whether you like conspiracies or not. Great movie.",10,3,7,28 August 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A great ode to Hollywood and cinema itself
","Greetings from Lithuania.The more you like cinema itself, the more you will likely to enjoy 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' (2019). This movie is about movies. Movies they were once, not now. Movies when there were stars with names, faces. Now it is a color of spandex that separates faces or characters. Back then it was different, and better.Tarantino's latest has most in common with his previous movies with ending and dialog. Those are as usual involving like no other. Ending is like its own 'Inglorious Bastards', fictionalized, but so so satisfying. Because this movie is about movies and those who are in love with them, and not about some dark humans.Overall, without any spoilers, i highly enjoyed this almost 3 hours Tarantino's movie. Its a great one. Not his best, but a one that shines with all that makes great movie - it looks like it was made like some 40 years ago, by its style, its settings and etc. This is a great movie for those looking for a something entirely different than today's mainstream cinema, yet superb.",10,12,15,14 December 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Fascinating movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Behind the Candelabra' (2013) is a truly amazing movie, filled with outstanding performances by two leads, and superb stuff by supporting actors. This is a great biopic, i didn't new nothing about the musician itself, but was so involved in a story unfolding on the screen. It's a superb picture in all directions. Michael Douglas is mindblowingly great in this picture, truly deserves all cudos and awards fro this picture - if it had been made for a big screen, it would be a guaranty Oscar for best performance. Writing, pacing, directing, everything works here to create one great picture.Overall, this is not your typical biopic about heroes, it's about a man, with his wishes, weaknesses and life itself. Great picture.",9,1,5,31 October 2014
Beasts of No Nation," Very solid cinema
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Beasts of No Nation' (2015) won't win the Oscar for best picture of the year nor the good leading performance by Idris Elba. Nevertheless it is a very solid film, sometimes brutal about realities in Africa, were children have to become soldiers and they day to day life. Cary Joji Fukunaga does a great job in directing, writing and shooting this film - cinematography is very good in here, it could get Oscar nomination. Directing is very solid, movie almost doesn't drag and is involving from start till finish. Although it was a bit hard to get attached to these kids doing very adult things, performances by young actors (who many of them were real soldiers) were amazing. Movie was shoot on locations and you can clearly see it and feel it. I also loved couple of long and unbroken shoots (they weren't as jaw-dropping as it was in 'True Detective' 4th episode of season 1, but they are great in here).Overall, although 'Beasts of No Nation' isn't very original (we kinda saw these stories before), it is a very solid film. It is sometimes bloody as war itself, but it's not gross. Craftmenship of this movie is very good in all directions, and although running time 2 h 13 min are a bit to long, this is very good and watchable movie.",8,3,6,1 November 2015
Gone Girl," Good picture, but don't expect to be blown away
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Gone Girl' (2014) is a very solid picture that grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go till the very last finish, which sadly to me was a bit disappointing. All actors did great job, but no Oscars will shine in here. When entering the theater i just read synopsis and some comments indicating that this is gonna be twists based thriller. There are twists, but they aren't that surprising, and the ending was a bit of disappointment. Nevertheless, i'm giving 'Gone Girl' 9/10 - it's very good written, acted and directed picture, at almost 2h 30 min. it doesn't drag, it's greatly paced and will leave you on the edge of your seat till the very end - very solid picture, but don't expect to be blow away.",9,1,12,5 October 2014
Django Unchained," This one has it almost all and truly delivers
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Django Unchained' (2012) is a superb flick in every way. Outstanding acting by all involved. Superb direction, mesmerizing writing, great art direction - everything works here on almost every cylinder. By almost i mean the ending, which for me looked a bit dragged. After the standout shoot out in the house, they went for some more additional 30 min, which weren't necessary in my opinion. Nevertheless, it's not a bad ending by any means, just the one that wasn't necessary.Overall, 'Django Unchained' is for You. No matter if you enjoy westerns. No matter if you enjoy over the top violence. No matter if you like Leo. No matter what - 'Django Unchained' is a pure movie escapism at it's very best. There are sequences in this movie that i have never ever witnessed in motion pictures before - and they are terrific. Only Quentin Tarantino could have made such an ultimate flick. Just sit back, kick off and enjoy 'Django Unchained' - it's a superb stuff in every direction.",9,1,4,10 January 2015
Get Out," Hands Down One of The Very Best Movies in 2017 So Far
","Greetings from Lithuania.So after seeing glowing reviews from critics and amazing score here at IMDb of 'Get Out' (2017) as a horror movie mega fan i was kinda dying to see this movie. After finally seeing it can safely say - this is simply of the very best (actually the best at the moment) movie in 2017 in my opinion. And i saw tons of film this year.'Get Out' isn't true terror horror movie, its not even the best horror movie out the at the moment to be honest. What makes this film special is its kinda mind blowing story, jaw-draping writing and perfect directing. Yes, the acting by everyone involved was more then uniformly good, especially by Allison Williams - this is a star making performance. How perfectly, smoothly and involving everything here is done is just beyond me - this newcomer writer / director Jordan Peele should be on a map of every movie goer from now on - it is hardly gets better then 'Get Out'.Overall, i wan't spoil anything nor i will go into plot details, but do yourself a favor and watch this amazing film no matter what genre you prefer. This is a blast from start till finish, easily one of the very, very best this year so far.",10,10,21,18 May 2017
The Theory of Everything," Good biopic
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Theory of Everything' (2014) is a very solid biopic. The two leading performances are very strong here. Music is amazing. Directing and script are good, but not as strong as performances or score. This is a very accurate biopic about a man we have seen on TV at least once, and by seeing it on screen you can clearly see the similarities. Eddie Redmayne gives a breakthrough performance, he surely deserves Oscar nomination and Golden Globe award. Overall, 'The Theory of Everything' isn't much about science - it's about the relationship between the famous physicist and his wife. It's not revolutionary fresh take on biopic genre and it doesn't reach the highs of 'A Beautiful Mind', but it's a good picture.",9,0,0,8 February 2015
Frozen," A First Rate Disney Product For The Youngest Audiences
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Frozen' (2013) is a one amazingly looking good feel animated movie for a youngest members of a family. Adults surely won't like it as much as 'Shrek' or etc. because this is a more friendly and cheezee movie oriented for the youngest audiences. Yes, it is cheezee as hell if you ask me, with especially some songs scenes looking more like an Eurovision song contest then actual movie, and with some songs (which become very popular) to which if i would need to ever listen to one more time again... don't ask. Overall, 'Frozen' is a beautifully looking, sometimes a bit (but just a bit funny) animated movie targeted especially for the youngest. It is a good nature movie, and its pacing is the best thing for more adults - at running time 1 h 35 min it almost never dragged. It is a good movie to see it once, but it isn't as original or exciting as i kinda hoped it would be.",8,3,7,30 January 2017
2012," Destructions of biblical scale
","Greetings from Lithuania.'2012' is a very solid entry into disaster movies genre. It has everything that one would like to have: great special effects, tons of action, larger than life main characters and destructions on a biblical scale. Hey, it's surely isn't the best picture of the year, but it does exactly what it promises, entertains us by showing end of the world and 2 dimensional characters trying to survive it. The master of these flicks Roland Emmerich have destroyed cities in the past pictures, but here he goes on total annihilation.Overall, if you have somehow skipped this flick on it's release, you can safely check this one out you like disaster flicks in general, because '2012' has it all.",8,3,5,2 January 2015
Room," One Of The Very Best Movies of 2015
","Greetings from Lithuania.Here is what a professional film critic from New York Post has to say about 'Room' (2015): 'Dopey as the film is on a plot level, it's equally vapid in its psychology'. Here is what i have to say to this 'professional film critic' - 'Dude, please, change you profession, ASAP, thank you'.'Room' (2015) is THE best drama that came from 2015. It features great performance by Brie Larson for which she deservedly must win Oscar, great supporting work from veteran familiar faces, and probably THE best acting from a child i have ever seen. This movie could have felt apart very quickly if it weren't greatly played by actor portraying Jack, in my opinion the key character in this story. Fortunately Jacob Tremblay gives unforgettable, jaw-dropping performance that glues this movie together. Superbly crafted by director Lenny Abrahamson and amazingly written by Emma Donoghue (based on her own novel), 'Room' tells the hard, gritty, and sometimes very difficult to imagine story, that unfortunately has happened in a real world just months ago (without children as i read). The first hour of this movie is simply a masterpiece. I won't spoil anything, but the second hour goes in a different direction, but never looses it's reality or great movie craftsmanship. I was waiting for this movie months after i heard about it, and finally seeing it i'm so glad it delivered everything i have hoped for - not that i wanted to see such a story - i wanted it to see happening on the screen, in a movie world. 'Room' is as good as movie drama gets it.Overall, i can't praise this movie more - this is the best movie that i saw in 2015. There are more movies from Best Picture contenders that i haven't seen it yet, but those will be more visceral experiences. 'Room' is different kind of drama. It unfold just in front of, keeps you glued to the screen for all it's running time 1 h 50 min. Sometimes it will be difficult to watch, but don't turn away - this is the best movie of 2015.",10,1,6,18 February 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Often uneven and sometimes breathtaking and gorgeous
","Greetings from Lithuania.Want to watch good film, with some breathtaking scenery, nice acting and nice story but nothing new or memorable? 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is for you. Don't expect anything revolutionary, no twists at the end, just a nice film, with as i said some gorgeous scenes, and some nice cameos. Actually, before watching a movie and reading summary, i imagined different film, with B.Stiller acting out in some crazy / fantasy comedy (and at the very brief moments - it is), but i got different film than i imagined, a really nice one. I don't think i will remember this film for more than two days after i saw it, but i glad i did, it was nice one while it lasted, but nothing you will remember for a long time, sometimes it gets all over the map. It's clear that a film had a good budget, you can clearly see this, but it didn't have good screenplay, and that you can clearly see it as well.",8,0,0,15 April 2014
Schindler's List," Excruciating masterpiece
","Greetings from Lithuania.To call 'Schindler's List' a great movie would be a huge underestimating. This is simply one of the best motion pictures of all time. I know it sounds banal but truth is simple - 'Schindler's List' is a masterpiece. No matter what are your believes, not matter what is your life experience or anything else - this is a monumental movie experience. Probably no other movie in my life grabbed my so hard, delivered me to the place and made me experience events so purely as 'Schindler's List' did. This is a movie making at it's very best. Everything in this movie works on highest level for some simple reasons - to get the knowledge and to learn. Learn from our past, learn from our unforgivable mistakes and to witness a descent humanity in the most ruthless places of our times. I won't going to start to admire this movie craftsmanship. It's brilliant. Everything here combines to a one excruciating masterpiece. One who will experience 'Schindler's List' won't going to ever forget it. This is a timeless masterpiece. And one of the most sticking things that ever haunted me was that this picture was created in Hollywoood, by Steven Spielberg who at the time was mostly known for mainstream blockbuster experiences. How could they come up with such an idea and most important how could they created this kind of a movie, which doesn't represent popular teams and tones is still beyond me. I guess, true art find it's way, and for this motion picture Steven Spielberg will be remembered forever.Overall, if you haven't experienced 'Schindler's List' by now, do your self a favor and witness this masterpiece ASAP. I'm writing this review from a country which is neighboring country to Poland. I'm so grateful to a simple luck that i wasn't born and wasn't there when these unthinkable events have happened. And my honest sympathy for those whom it has ever affected.",10,9,13,17 January 2015
The Lion King," Great looking yet boring and uninteresting
","Greetings from Lithuania.While i'm not the biggest fan of the original The Lion King because i was 33 when i first watched - yet even that one was way better then 'The Lion King' (2019). It wasn't a bad movie because it looked amazing, but other then that and great voice acting by Seth Rogen this new version wasn't interesting and was kinda boring to be honest. Songs were pretty lame and uninspiring and the whole thing just felt poorly paced.Overall, i would recommend to watch the original for those haven't seen it over this one. It isn't a bad movie, but not a very good one either.",6,0,0,6 July 2020
I Am Legend," A Great Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.This is a great movie. Not only W.Smith fans but all movie lovers are going to love this one. Acting is superb by, actually, two stars of a movie - W.Smith and dog Sam (Abbey), she definitely deserved nomination here :) Settings of 'I Am Legend' is one big character of the movie. Visual and sound effects are great. I liked the original ending more, but alternative ending is quite good too. Watch this one, you won't regret. 9,9/10",10,0,1,29 August 2011
A Quiet Place," Highly entertaining, involving and effective thriller
","Greetings from Lithuania.Just came back from the screening of 'A Quiet Place' (2018) ans i can safely say - this movie worth every minute of your time. Its a superbly crafted movie (kudos to director John Krasinski) and superbly acted by everyone involved. It is very intense, very involving and interesting movie. There are many very intense moments, as well as jump scare moments (not that i'm a fan of those). The tension is created amazingly.Overall, you should definitely watch 'A Quiet Place' if you like intense and involving thrillers. Sometimes the quite itself can be more efficient then big monsters. Superb movie.",10,4,8,8 April 2018
22 Jump Street," Fun movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'22 Jump Street' (2014) is real fun to watch. Everything that worked in first film appears in this as well. All actors are great for this material, and they are good. It's funny, fast, very well paced and at the moments hilariously great. There also are interesting and very well inserted inside jokes and references, for example, the very brief Benny Hill joke was hilarious. If you liked the first part, you will be laughing watching this flick as well. Overall, 9/10 for '22 Jump Street', a really funny, good flick - if you enjoyed first, it's safe to see this one as well.",9,3,9,19 October 2014
The Game," One Of The Best Thrillers Of All Time
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Game' (1997) is a true example of superb, edge of your seat and intelligent thriller. Everything works in this movie so good, that you will be glued to your screen during the whole movie. Saw this movie back in 1997, and 3-4 times after - it hardly gets better than this. Michael Douglas stars in one of the best films of the great David Fincher (first one is STILL his 'Se7en' in my opinion) and he does a superb job in creating a wealthy man who gets a birthday present of a lifetime called as 'The Game'. When 'The Game' starts, you are in a thriller ride of you lifetime. Overall, 'The Game' is a good as thriller can possible be. It's not the best of all time, but it is unforgettable movie. Scene by scene you will be involved in this picture, and by the very end you will definitely say, 'what a great movie that was'.",10,2,3,31 August 2015

It isn't, but what it is is a solid coming of age / character study drama carrier by a very good acting especially by Timothée Chalamet and good writing. The movie takes place on one of those places were you would love to spend your summer.Overall, 'Call Me by Your Name' is a solid romance / drama. It was superbly acted and solidly written and created this world were everything looks so easy. Good movie overall, but not that great.",8,0,3,15 April 2018

And, once again, as much as i love 'Avatar' - 'The Hurt Locker' is the best edited film of this year (and one of the best ever).I'm not an American,and i don't really know all the aspects of war in Iraq. But this movie is SO much more than just politic, it's a spectacular character study (almost as good as we saw in 'The Thin Red Line').Watch this film, because it's a 'small' masterpiece in almost every possible way. BRAVO to Kathryn Bigelow - and, for the last time, as much as i love 'Avatar' - good luck on the Oscars evening.",10,33,51,20 February 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Unnecessary sequel which isn't particular bad, nor its really good
","Greetings from Lithuania.When watching 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' (2017) i couldn't honestly remember which movie this was in a series, honestly. I know i saw them all, but that is because the series become very forgettable. While it lasted, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' wasn't at least boring - it was an OK flick to say the best when watching it on some boring evening.Special effects were pretty good, and i kinda liked the opening sequence with the bank - that were some good and pretty impressive settings. Later it become 'as usual kinda flick, where someone chases someone and they are all after something'. Performances were forgettable as is this movie - Johnny Depp is just a costume and make up in here - there isn't any signs of great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow as it was in a first movie for which he was nominated for Oscar - here is clearly just for a big paycheck. Overall, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' isn't bad movie, nor its good. Its somewhere in between but by the end i realized that this series needs to end or be rebooted completely. They should start with the basics and first of all make an involving story first. All in all 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' is an OK (at the best) but highly forgettable flick.",6,0,1,7 November 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," It would be a lie to say it wasn't entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.To my surprise (after reading some pretty bad reviews from critics) - i had a pretty good time watching 'X-Men: Apocalypse' (2016). Because i'm not a fan, i was pretty lost at the beginning - although seeing all movies in the series i wasn't even sure what time line are we in it this time - its because previous film was so forgettable, i wasn't even sure what was going on in the beginning, when all of these x-men started to pop in on screen - like 'wait - wasn't he or she a villain in some previous whatever it was movie?' Wasn't' he or she killed? Oh wait, this is a prequel. To a sequel? Wait, what? About the best thing in this movie - with every performance of a brilliant Oscar Isaac i witness, the more i believe this man will hold Oscar statue pretty soon - it's just a question of when. Although under heavy make-up and costume, he was a superbly cool villain in my opinion, who just FELT as a total bad ass of bad asses - surely some better lines for him wouldn't have hurt, script isn't strongest in this movie, but it not bad at all either. Others were pretty good, but none of them really shined. Overall, to be short as possible and honest, i'm not a fan of 'X- Men' nor other Marvel superheroes. But it would be a lie to say i wasn't entertained for like 2 h 15 min. watching 'X-Men: Apocalypse' (2016). It has lots of special effects, and they were solid. It also has pretty cool scene in the middle, when someone gets to save someone - nice stuff. Film also had a nicely paced plot, although there is a lot of going on in this movie, A LOT - it was nicely paced and i wasn't bored nor i lost my interest in watching it.",8,4,5,19 September 2016
Meet Joe Black," Good movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.I liked 'Meet Joe Black' (1998) when i first saw it back in 1999 - i was 15 at the time. Today i watched it for a second time - i'm 34 now, so its been almost 20 years - and i still liked it the way i did first time. 'Meet Joe Black' is by any mean a great movie - it is not. Nor its a classic, but what it is a superbly looking 3 hours movie escapism. It has great premise, great story, very solid acting by my all time favorite Sir Anthony Hopkins and very good performance by always reliable Brad Pitt. Claire Forlani on the other hand did not create very memorable character in my opinion, although she looked absolutely stunning in this movie - you can't take your eyes of her. Production values of this movie were stunning - cinematography by a future 2 times Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, production design by a legendary Dante Ferretti - this movie looks absolutely stunning - no wonder it cost almost 100 mil. to create.Overall, 'Meet Joe Black' isn't a great movie, because it has some issues with screenplay (no a great premise), some corny dialog and situations and some scenes that do drag. But other then that - here is fantasy / romance movie that is marvelous to look at. Good movie.",8,2,2,22 February 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Amazing indeed
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' (2014) in my opinion is the best Spider Man movie yet, and i enjoyed it much more than any of the Marvel studios created movies yet (though i haven't see 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2014' yet) - you can already start throwing rocks at me. Why is it so good?At 2:20 h. running time i was captivated from first till last second. Ye, it was a bit cheesy at the end in the street fight with the kid stepping in, but overall, it's a hell of a entertainment. Great special effects sequences, absolutely marvelous chemistry between two leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, and very captivating plot - it's all works. Althrough the sequence in which J.Foxx becomes a villain (no spoilers here) was kinda lame, he was a cool villain. And what an ending! Bottom line. As i see here at IMDb that there are many who disliked the film, here is the last nail in my review - i will wait for 3rd installment of this franchise much more that i will wait for a sequel to any Marvel movie that i have seen yet - it is superb entertainment.",10,23,39,24 August 2014
Ex Machina," Good sci-fi drama, but not sensationally good
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Ex Machina' (2015) is sci-fi drama with a few thriller elements. There isn't much action in this movie, dialogs do the action here. The plot is good and somehow fresh, but not an original one. Performances are good by Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander, but not so much from Domhnall Gleeson - he is just OK here. There aren't many special effects but they are done very well. There are some great ideas that asked in this movie, yet never really answered. In my case, i just wanted to see good movie, 'Ex Machina' is a good one but ideas didn't really involved me.Overall, 'Ex Machina' is good sci-fi drama. Maybe it's a bit over-hyped when seeing critics reviews or very high IMDb rating, but nevertheless it's a solid picture. My vote was 7, but strong ending got the final vote for 8.",8,0,3,25 May 2015
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Very good
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Kaze no tani no Naushika' (1984) is another superb piece of art from a great Hayao Miyazaki. It tells a very involving sci-fi / fantasy story and it tells it very well. The animation is deep, rich and beautiful as always, although not as impressive as it will be in creators next efforts, but that's understandable as it was one of the first movies he created.Still, 'Kaze no tani no Naushika' is not to be missed to all who loves works of Hayao Miyazaki and who likes good sci-fi stories. It has intriguing story, a strong environmental message, superb pacing (at running time almost 2 hours it surprisingly never drags). Overall, 'Kaze no tani no Naushika' is not to be missed.",9,1,2,1 March 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," Very solid picture
","Greetigs from Lithuania.'Pawn Sacrifice' (2014) is a very solid, entertaining, involving and good biopic drama. It tels a true story about not your typical sport star, and does it well. The guy was very annoying, and i wasn't rooting for him to say the truth, but at the chess table, he was something to say the least. Picture, despite being about chess grandmaster, it very entertaining and intense. All actors did a very good job, although no awards will shine in here. Director also did a great job, pacing of this movie is very solid, at running time 1 h 45 min movie barely drags.Overall, this is a movie about troubled chess-grandmaster. It tells involving and true story about sport which isn't the most popular or involving, but is surprisingly well depicted in this movie.",9,1,5,24 December 2015
Men in Black II," One of the worst sequels ever made
","Greetings from Lithuania.Writing. Writing was the first and the most important reason why 'Men in Black' II (2002) is actually one of the worst sequels that has ever been made. I loved the first movie, which was truly funny and original piece of entertainment. But this one lacked anything that made first film so good and in a first place - a good writing. While the story here is pretty pathetic, i believe that every story no matter how crazy they are can be made into a good movie, but there has to be a good writing in a first place. 'Men in Black' II did not have it and it failed miserably.Overall, 'Men in Black' II is not only a low point of the series, its one of the worst sequels ever made. Its overproduced, overwritten and lacked everything that made first movie great.",3,2,4,28 October 2018
Coco," Amazing
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Coco' (2017) is a one beautiful and just amazing movie to experience. It exceeded my expectations on every level. Music was beautiful and not overused, story was great - this movie has a pretty unique and fresh story to be honest. Directing was great - at running time 1 h 40 min i was highly involved into this story and world. Animation itself was simply stunning.Overall, when Pixar is at the top of its game, 'Coco' happens. This is a sure classic, the one that should be seen and remembered by everyone, no matter the age. Great movie.",10,0,2,27 March 2018
1917," A visualy stuning cinema
","Greetings from Lithuania.'1917' (2019) is a movie during which i constantly said to myself - i have never seen anything like it. And indeed, from a craftsmanship perspective - this movie is visually stuning piece of art. Its not my favorite war movie ever by any means, but its a great entry into war movies genre. It reminded me a bit of 'Come and See' (USSR masterpiece) regarding its visual style. Directing was amazing as well terrific cinematography - Roger D. deserves another Oscar for this masterpiece of visual telling of a story.Overall, while '1917' lacks more character development, its unlike anything i have ever seen (and i saw 'Victoria', truly done in one shot). This is a great cinema.",9,1,3,11 January 2020
Children of Men," Alfonso Cuarón's 'Children of Men'
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Children of Men' is a masterpiece, pure and simple, deep and true. I have watched this film probably 5 time, and every single time i see something new, some new details. What a film!How this movie wasn't nominated for Oscar for the best achievement in directing is still beyond me. Just look at it - it's breathtaking. I saw documentary with the director, claiming they were creating 'Anti Blade Runner' future, and you can almost feel it - everything looks real, you can almost touch it - if this situation would happen in the real world, it would definitely look like that. Everything in this movie works. It's definitely not you typical shoot-em up science fiction - it's just one of the best movies ever created. And i don't event want to start with the long shots sequences - they are mesmerizing and breathtaking. The performances are top notch. M.Caine does outstanding job in creating this 'light at the end of the tunnel' type person that you just want it would be real in this dark future - it's that good. Every performance, every actor is at the top of the game. This movie is a true masterpiece in directing - so much details, the backgrounds - it's like watching the real world unfolding right in the front of your eyes.Deep and true, sad and tragic, 'Children of Men' is one of the most unforgettable movies you will ever see.",10,1,3,25 July 2013
Million Dollar Baby," Clint Eastwood's Masterpiece
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Million Dollar Baby' (2004) is a masterpiece - pure and simple. It knocks you to the bone. I have seen this movie like 3 times in my life, and it never looses it powerful punch. That is because of simple and simply perfect directing work by Mr. Eastwood, powerhouse performances by Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman both won Oscars for crying out loud!) as well as one of the best (if not) by in his carrier by Eastwood himself. And the heart of the movie lies not in a boxing sequences (although they are brutal and real) but in a relationships between these characters we do care about. And when the ending comes, prepare to have some pure small tears in your eyes - because this movie earns it.Overall, as a director C.Eastwood made a lot of great and amazing movies, but 
'Million Dollar Baby' in my opinion is his crowning achievement. Movies are hardly being made better then this one.",10,0,1,30 September 2018
Donnie Brasco," Great gangster movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Donnie Brasco' (1997) is a sure killer gangster movie. It features great performances from all involved, especially as expected by two leads, but supporting actors do a great job as well. It tells a real story, and that is why this movie is so powerful. I won't go into details, but plot here is much more then in other gangster movies because it is real, well most of it. It is impossible to imagine what one might feel when every single minute in his job could have been his last - now that's a job for which successful accomplishment a watch a 500$ paycheck looks like a sucker punch in a face and below to say the least. Overall, 'Donnie Brasco' is superbly involving and great gangster movie. It has many true things to say about mafia and friendship. Great true cinema.",9,0,0,24 August 2015
Grave of the Fireflies," Good
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Hotaru no haka' (1988) is a very good animated movie. It's surely not for children, especially not for children of this generation. 'Hotaru no haka' is for adult viewers, who will find here many things that were touched by war. It's a sad story, not inspiring one.Overall, 'Hotaru no haka' is a really good movie. It's perfectly paced, it's storytelling is good and it has some truly moving and sad parts. If you in for this stuff, 'Hotaru no haka' (aka 'Grave of Fireflys') is surely not to be missed. It's not the best animated movie of all time, but it's a very compelling one.",8,2,4,26 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A fun and impressive movie for a Friday evening
","Greetings from Lithuania.I did enjoy 'Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi '(2017) for what it was - a funny, spectacularly crafted adventure extravaganza. I do however understand why so many fans are upset with this movie (i'm not a huge fan of the series) - it lacks continuity from previous movie / movies not it really sets up next film because most of the things were kinda done in this part, episode 9 now does not look so promising.However as a standalone movie going experience, 'The Last Jedi' is a fun movie, you got to give it to it. It contains superb special effects and action sequences, and to be honest it is a bit more original then previous part - it added something new. Acting was great by Benicio Del Toro and Mark Hamill - best performances in this movie. Writing was pretty solid as well as directing - at running time 2 h 30 min this movie did drag a bit in the middle, but its a well paced movie.Overall, as not a huge Star Wars fan i have to say i did enjoy this movie. It is a big budget extravaganza which isn't the best in the series, but far from cheezee mess that episode 1 and 2 were. Fun movie overall, definitely worth watching on the big screen.",8,1,9,17 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Best Marvel Movie Yet
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014) is simply the best Marvel movie yet. I saw them all, and honestly, i wasn't so dragged into a simple joy of watching a Marvel universe picture before. This one has it all and beyond. The script is so good, so funny, so not to serious about itself that it's a joy to simply listen to a characters, and what a great characters there are. Directed wonderfully by James Gunn, it's a winner from start to finish. The visuals are superb (sure Oscar nominee), the soundtrack is excellent, acting settings and all clicks on every cylinder. What is unusual for big budget flick, is that is not takes itself serious, and this is why we can't help of watching it with wonder - it's very original. MIchael Bay should watch this movie as an example and learn of how big budget movies should be made in the first place.Overall, whether you are Marvel fan or not, do your self a favor and watch this picture with your friends and I guarantee you, you will have a truly entertaining movie evening.",10,2,7,18 December 2014
The Imitation Game," Very solid movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Imitation Game' (2014) is a very solid biography, history drama. It has great performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, very solid directing, involving script. Nevertheless this movie isn't perfect, because although it's very solidly made, the feeling that i'm being a bit manipulated was over me during whole picture. Reasoons for that are a bit one note performance by Keira Knightley - she's just so good-natured person and best friend next door during whole movie - hard not to like her, this is a good performance, but not that good to earn Oscar nomination. Script, which won Oscar is great, involving and intriguing, but i also felt some minor manipulations here and there, because it's a bit formulaic / routine biopic. The scene in which we first meet Keira Knightley's character and the outcome of it was clear after the first seconds of this scene.Overall, there aren't many flaws in this movie and it's very good - you should definitely watch it - this is superbly paced movie about person who made some truly amazing and important works but wasn't recognized during his life.",9,1,4,18 April 2015
Ip Man," Solid film
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Yip Man' (2008) is a mix of biopic and martial arts movie. It has some drama, but nothing really deep or unforgettable. It has cool fighting scenes, great art direction, nice acting. The movie looks beautifully, the set decorations are very good. The story, based on the life of real Yip Man, master of Bruce Lee, is involving and sometimes touching, although i believe it was all like this in real life, i do believe it's based on many real events, but certainly they haven't fight like this in that time or place.Overall, 'Yip Man' is enjoyable cross of biopic set in WW2 times, with some greatly choreographed fight scenes, great art direction, nice acting. It's a big predictable at times, but nevertheless i was involved during whole movie.",8,0,0,2 November 2014
From Dusk Till Dawn," Superb
","Greetings from Lithuania.Imagine my surprise when nearly 20 years ago i was 11 years old and got a VHS copy (a highly good quality at the moment) of 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. George Clooney was just a new and nice screen presents at the time and the many horror action flick were in the future. At the time i didn't know what was the true genre of this movie, thought it was going to be a nice thriller.For the most 50 min. it was actually a very well made thriller, with some hostages and a very likable main hero (or antagonist) and very basic plot line. But then, suddenly everything changed. At running time i think 55 min (didn't saw this movie in many many years now so sorry for inaccuracy) suddenly this thriller changed his genre in a moment, like probably no other flick till this date (02/05/2015) has ever did. From a heist thriller this became a monster movie, with NO earlier hints on that. NO hints. This is a rare as it can be. Tarantino? No. Yes and no. Even he prepares audience for a ride in a first minutes whatever wild roads it might take them. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' was a different kind of beast. Gory, bloody, over the top, and bloody entertaining.Overall, if you haven't saw this flick, you probably won't be surprised of suddenly change in it's narrative during the ride because it's surely was spoiled many time already. Nevertheless, you should DEFINITELY see this flick as it delivers goods. All in or nothing - this flick delivers.",10,1,2,2 May 2015
The Last Emperor," Production values and overall craftsmanship makes up for slow burning story
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Last Emperor' (1987) extended version which runs for 3 h 34 min is a truly great bold cinema. It's an epic biopic in every meaning of this word, and yet is not a traditional epic because there isn't very much action in this movie, and person described in this movie wasn't the one who could look really great in epic picture.This is a slow movie, and it's running time 3 h 34 min can be unforgiven for those who want to see this movie - take your time to watch this picture, because you may not view it in one time.Production values of 'The Last Emperor' are magnificent. Famously shoot at locations it features one of the very best production of epic movies i have ever saw. The costumes, music, cinematography, direction - it's all was Oscar worthy - no wonder this movie took 9 Oscars - it's a fabulous creation.Overall, i won't lie - 'The Last Emperor' is a true movie art and not an entertainment for mainstream audiences. It's a very long picture, and 3 h 34 min doesn't fly fast - this movie takes it's time to show us this story and pacing of this movie is not rushed, for some it might be unbearable to watch this till the end in one viewing. Nevertheless, this is a great movie.",9,1,1,2 May 2015
Jurassic World," Highly entertaining and a true sequel to the original
","Greetings from Lithuania.After my next words i do believe i will be stricken by a lightning but still here it goes - 'Jurassic World' (2015) is THE most entertaining 'Jurassic' movie YET. Before you starting to throw rocks at me, here is the only reason why i think this movie is the best in the series (including the original) - simply because it is superbly entertaining.The first film had a groundbreaking special effects, and the first hour or so was amazing, but when the shix hit the fan, it wasn't so exciting anymore. I always believed the human characters were weak in the first movie, although actors and acting were very solid, somehow for me second part of the movie was simply boring. Yes. Second movie was the worst Steven Spielberg's movie yet, even Steven Spielberg have admit it. The third was OK, better then 2nd by a mile. That said, 'Jurassic World' should have been the true sequel to the original. It is bigger, louder and more entertaining - everything that a good sequel must have. Special effects in here are truly special, i don't see any movie this year who could steal the best special effects Oscar from 'Jurassic World' - they aren't groundbreaking, but they are truly spectacular. Acting was very cool, as well as cinematography and very solid directing. Now i kinda see why this guy will helm one of the new 'Star Wars' movies, which about i was skeptical before seeing 'Jurassic World'. Overall, 'Jurassic World' is a highly entertaining movie. Best of all is to see it with friends on the biggest screen possible, it is a helluva entrainment, not a perfect one, but the best from this franchise yet.",9,38,66,27 September 2015
Silence," Good movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Silence' (2016) is a good movie made by one of the best Martin Scorsese. This is surely not the directors most involving movie, but that is because of story. It is an important and unique one, as movies goes. But its also its kinda weak point in my opinion, because at running time 2 h 40 min this movie does drag a bit, but only because of story which is like i said is fresh and important, but as a movie subject does involve kinda hardly.That said, 'Silence' is a one gorgeous movie to look at. Craftsmanship is a first rate. Acting was great, especially by Andrew Garfield. Script was also very good one because during the whole movie i wasn't bored by it - i was involved but like i said because of amazing craftsmanship, not the story.Overall, 'Silence' is a very good movie. While the story here isn't the most involving thing, the great craftsmanship and script demands this movie to be seen once for sure.",8,0,1,13 August 2017
Logan," Wolverine Has Left The Building
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Logan' (2017) is, to put it simply - the best 'X-Men' movie I've ever seen (and i saw them all). This is not as much as 'X-Men' movie, and it doesn't even feel as a third part in its own 'Wolverine' series - 'Logan' is a standalone movie, which you can safely see even if your first and the last seen 'X-Men' series movie was the first X-Men (2000). From start till finish, it is a blast. Now i'm not a huge fan of 'X-Men' series, but i saw and enjoyed all of them. Strangely, when watching 'Logan', i barely and even very hardly remembered that i have seen first two movies - they were so forgettable. But after credits of this movie started to roll i was sure - i won't forget this movie for sure.This is a superhero movie for those who think that all Marvel studio movies are to formulaic and plays it to safe. This is a superhero movie for those who think that DC movies aren't to focused and are all over the map. This is a superhero movie for those who lost their track of a countless of 'X-Men' sequels / prequels / spin offs / reboots who works as a prequel and sequel ... wait what? 'Logan' is arguably the best superhero movie i saw since the 'The Dark Knight' trilogy. It is not as epic as 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, not to mention all other superhero movies in a market. This is a bloody, gritty, realistic, down to earth approach to this 'genre' and so involving that at running time 2 h 15 min i was involved from the first minute till the closing scene (and it is a great, great scene). Acting by all involved were great, with Hugh Jackman giving one of the best performances of his carrier (seriously). 'Logan' shows very clearly and without turning camera away of what happens when Wolverine claws hits the human flesh - it doesn't look so 'superhero cool' anymore - and i loved it. There is no doubt of why this is an R rated movie. The story itself kinda reminded me of 'The Last of Us' - it is that simple yet powerful tale. Overall, 'Logan' is a blast. This is a superhero movie like i haven't seen before, even in 'The Dark Knight' movies but i'm not saying its better - no, those were better but i'm still giving this movie a 10/10 - please, 20th Century Fox - bring this quality movies more often, do not go in a formulaic and safe road, bring us something different, fresh and bold. 'Logan' is the best movies of the early 2017 so far.",10,3,8,3 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A nice looking popcorn mess
","Greetings from Lithuania.Can someone please explain to me what was all the buzz for 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'? This movie holds an 7,8 rating at IMDb but is barely 7/10 movie at all. This is a nice looking, turn off your brain popcorn mess - that is it - nothing more. Dialogs were written for 13-16 years old audiences - 'Watch you language'!, really? Although there are some nice comedic scenes, this movie takes itself way to much serious, but it so absurd that i didn't care what was going on, where, who, how and etc. - one sure shouldn't be thinking about movies plot when watching 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'.Special effects were good, but this is no surprise - they have to look great, because there wouldn't be much to watch at all in here if they weren't good. Acting is OK for this stuff - they all just put the mask of 'oh I'm in the Marvel movie' and made their way through the movie. Why did Elizabeth Olsen even tried with the fake accent? No one cared for her accent in this mess. James Spader did a good job in voicing the main villain, but watching this kinda kids movie you know villain is doomed from the moment he appears on screen - you won't win if you are a villain in a Marvel movie! Overall, if you are 14 years old and a fan boy of comics on which this mess is based on - you will like this (probably). If you are not 14 years old and aren't comic book fan - you can skip this one, it is just a messy eye candy with beer and popcorn.",7,4,10,12 September 2015
Hotel Mumbai," Powerful and heartbreaking
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Hotel Mumbai' (2018), based on a true and horrible events is a very powerful, raw and heartbreaking movie. It clearly shows the unthinkable events that happened, when people were killed left and right. This movie, based on these events is a also serves as a white-knuckle thriller, but its just more devastating knowing that all this happened in real life.Overall, doesn't glorify the survivors nor those who helped other to survive that much. It shows events that happened, and does that in a very real way. This is a very good movie about very horrible tragedy.",10,1,14,14 November 2019
The Dark Knight," Not just a 'Superhero' type movie...
","Greetings from Lithuania.This movie 'put a smile on my face!' I just came back from premiere of this movie in our country and i can tell you one thing - this film is a serious stuff.Forget all 'Spider Man' or 'Superman' type blockbusters - this movie is serious as it gets! Dark, real, and scary (in different ways) - this movie beats them all! It is a crime movie and a suspense-thriller - not a superhero movie.Heath Ledger really deserves an Oscar nomination for his Jocker - one of the best villains i have ever saw on a big screen. Watching him on screen i thought - that's what makes performances unforgettable.Ch. Nolan created a 'real' world and a 'real' movie about Batman. It's so real that even scares. One of the things i like about this movie is that it has very limited CGI.'Dark Knight' won't win an Oscar for a best picture of the year, but it's the best action - adventure film of this decade (along with 'Bourne Ultimatum').My hat is off to Christopher Nolan and his brother for creating the essence of a masterpiece.So, 'why so serious?!'",10,6,13,24 July 2008
Everest," OK for one viewing
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Everest' (2015) is kinda disappointing movie if you asked me. It has big great names in acting department attached, although we never really care that much about them - sure this is a sad story, based on very unfortunate events, but script lacks more involvement with characters. Acting was uniformly good, but nothing special. There are some great cinematography, and special effects do create this sense of place, but sometimes lazy directing takes away some tension moments. That said it surprisingly good paced movie, at running time 1 h 50 min it almost never drags.Overall, 'Everest' is a simply an OK movie for one viewing. Maybe we did see those stories before, and some better done, and although this movie is based on very true story, it fails to capture it - it is not a bad movie by any means, but overall package is flawed.",7,0,0,25 January 2016
Annie Hall," Brilliant Wrtting and Amazing Acting Carries This Delightfull Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Annie Hall' (1977) is a brilliantly acted and written romance / comedy / drama. Movie was really funny, more then i thought will be. Directing and especially writing by Woody Allen were just brilliant. Acting by Diane Keaton was amazing to say the least - this wasn't acting - this was a real person right in front of us, this is probably her best performance, her crowning achievement, although i always liked her. The story itself is very simple yet, again, amazingly written. Overall, 'Annie Hall' is a delight from start till finish. Very funny, very smart, superbly written and wonderfully acted this is a great movie on all accounts.",9,1,3,25 October 2016
2001: A Space Odyssey," Great and exceptional motion picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) is truly a great and unique motion picture. By saying unique, i mean boldness of this picture. It is great because of many things - truly unique storytelling, simple and at the same time difficult plot, the special effects which in the year 2014 looks great, classical music incorporated with dazzling and breathtaking visuals and a scope larger then life. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is not a trill ride or 'lets grab a popcorn and watch some sci-fi flick' type of picture. To truly appreciate it, you have to sit down and simply enjoy it - it's like watching a painting, and '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a true art. This movie is segmented in parts, and all of them are truly great in they own way. The most sophisticated and after 2nd viewing still unclear to me is the last part, probably for which i'm giving a 9/10 for this classic. I know, art sometimes isn't meant to be understood, but nevertheless, for me it was a bit to much. Overall, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a motion picture, that can truly be called an art. It's never going to get old, even if humankind will reach Jupiter one day, this motion picture will always going to be viewed as a classic art of movie making. It's bold, unique, gorgeous sophisticated and unforgettable.",9,1,2,29 December 2014
War Machine," Superb
","Greetings from Lithuania.'War Machine' (2017) was a very pleasant surprise for me. I kinda expected it to be ... i don't know what after seeing mixed critics reviews and kinda low score on IMDb. But this is a superbly involving, funny, smart movie in the best traditions of 'Wag the Dog' (1997) and other good satire movies. Brad Pitt absolutely kills it as Gen. Glen McMahon - this is a over the top performance which could be said (and is said by many) is a bad one, but i found it superb - exactly suited for a role - this one of the most interesting performances in his carrier in many moons. Supporting performances were solid and especially by Anthony Michael Hall. There are also some very well known faces made a cameos, all great ones. Script was smart, involving and sometimes very funny. Directing was solid - at running time 2 hours this movie never dragged and was involving from start till finish. Overall, 'War Machine' is a superb movie for those who like smart satires about war. It is surprisingly original movie the one which isn't predictable for a second. All in all this is a superb picture.",9,5,10,1 June 2017
Midsommar," Bold and hardly forgettable
","Greetings from Lithuania.Its been a while since a saw a movie like 'Midsommar' (2019). I saw director's cut, which ran at 2 h 45 min - its a long movie so be prepared. I won't go into spoilers, but i will say that 'Midsommar' does not play as a conventional horror movie. It is barely a horror movie at all. Yet its themes can be horrifying, hopeful and bizarre for sure. It takes a visionary director to make such a film. At times, it reminded of 'Eyes Wide Shut' by S. Kubrick. And this is only a second movie by Ari Aster, whose debut film 'Hereditary' was better as horror movie, but this one was more bold and unique.Overall, i'm affraid 'Midsommar' is not for everyone's taste. If you liked The Wicker Man (1975), you should be at home watching this movie. It is a good piece of cinema, this i'm sure of and i really liked it overall.",8,2,13,3 May 2020
Singin' in the Rain," Hollywood At It's Best
","Greetings from Lithuania.What a charming and beautiful 'Singin' in the Rain' (1952) is. Great acting, music, staged dances, script, story, performances, direction - it all clicks here at it's very best. In general i don't like musical, highly dislike them. I do not understand why i some serious conditions everybody just stars singing and dancing. But 'Singin' in the Rain' one of the few best exceptions i have ever saw (first time in 2016 to be honest). This is a movie that doesn't take it self seriously, but it is a very direct representation of Hollywood's system (behind the scene), and it is just a charming musical as well.Overall, 'Singin' in the Rain' is a great movie. If you haven't seen it yet, do your self a favorite and do it now. Doesn't matter that it is 64 years old now, great things don't age - 'Singin' in the Rain' is like a great bottle of wine - it ages with charm. Great movie.",10,0,2,7 January 2016
The Mummy Returns," Not good and poorly paced
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Mummy Returns' (2001) was fan worse movie then superb first film. It lacks anything that made first film fun - very poorly paced, with lots of not fun adventures and some lines (lots of them actually) and acting that made my eyes rolling. Special effects weren't that special, check out this movie now and you will see how dated it looks now. And the ending with The Scorpion King was pretty OK, but special effects of the The Scorpion King himself has to be (still) one of the worst special effects efforts ever.Overall, 'The Mummy Returns' is louder, more action oriented sequel that lacks everything that made first film truly fun and very impressively looking adventure. As for now, this is the worst film in the series.",6,0,1,25 January 2017
Avatar," The most spectacular motion picture ever
","Greetings from Lithuania.2 years have past since 'Avatar' blow out the cinemas in this 'dying' world. 2 years have past since we visited Pandora for our first time. In these two years, nothing, nothing in this world came even in a mile to 'Avatar's' experience (and i'm a real fan of 'Inception'). James Cameron is my favorite director since his 'Aliens'. I simply love every single movie (except the one with flying fishes - killers) he made. I'm waited for 'Avatar' from the moment i first heard about J.Cameron making his new 'groundbreaking' movie since 'Titanic', it was in 2004. In December of 2009 'Avatar' blew out everything. Never in my life i didn't saw anything like that before (and i saw almost everything) :) In local 3D theater in was impossible to have a ticket. Everyone talked only about this experience in theaters.Recently i revisited Pandora on Blu Ray on my 2,2 m x 2 m HD screen - it's a breathtaking ride.",10,2,4,15 August 2011
Frank," Bizarre and entertaining movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Frank' (2014) is kinda unique movie, it has great feel - bizarre, bold, darkly funny - if you like this stuff, you will definitely enjoy 'Frank'. Acting is good, but nothing outstanding - the script in here is what makes 'Frank' unique as well as very solid directing and nice pacing. Don't take this movie serious, really, because if turn it on to watch some good drama with comedy elements, it can be very hard to watch experience. But if you are in the mood for some bold and funny flick, 'Frank' is not to be missed.Overall, in the traditions of good alternative music album, 'Frank' delivers - don't expect to be blown away, and it will may surprise you.",8,0,1,2 November 2014

","Greetings from Lithuania.'Selma' (2014) is not just a history lesson - it's engaging, involving and very well made picture. It features great performances from all involved, especially by lead man. Settings are good, they take you to the place. Music is very good here, direction, cinematography is solid.Overall, 'Selma' is not just a reminder of history, it is a very well movie on it's own. At running time 2 h this movie never drags and is involving from start till finish. There are some moving parts, but it's not a tearjerker. Based on very true events, this is a good history lesson as well as motion picture. All in all, this is a good movie.",8,0,1,27 May 2015
The Artist," 'I'm not a puppet! I'm an Artist!'
","Greetings from Lithuania.Was is a good idea to make a silent black&white movie in the age of 'Avatar'? - yes, (if you have an idea, passion to do this and not a lot of money). Is 'The Artist' a good movie? - definitely. Is it worth of the awards it won? - definitely. Now the main question - was it wort of winning the Oscar for the Best Movie of the year? In my opinion - no.As i said, 'The Artist' is great movie, charming movie, made with a good idea, wonderful performances of two leading actors, and with a nice score. And yet, i would prefer 'The Descendants' of taking home the Oscar for a best movie. It's when i first time heard all the buzz about 'The Artist', and the love it portraits to Hollywood's 'history', i could bet on everything that we already have a Best Oscar winner for 2011. It's a 'perfect' winner. After watching it, i disagree with this award. Why? Here comes an ugly word for a movie review - it's just 'small'. The world's best film of the year never ever should look 'small'. And yet, i truly recommending to see this movie to anyone who doesn't scare to spend an hour and a half with a silent black&white movie, you will have a really good time. And Bravo to Jean Dujardin - his performance blew my away. By the way, just the fact, Michel Hazanavicius is a real native form Lithuania.",9,2,4,18 March 2012
La La Land," Good movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'La La Land' (2016) is a one good movie. Performances by both lead were great, and directing by a great Damien Chazelle was amazing. Music was also good, and this film could be seen even by those who don't like musical movies at all, like it do. Story here is not very simple actually, its more then a love story. It kinda shows you the realities of La La Land and how can someone go up and someone fail in this land. Regarding best actresses win for Emma Stone, she was very good in this movie and i really like her as an actress (she is very natural), but i still do think that Oscar should have been given to Isabelle Huppert - her performance in 'Elle' was outstanding. All other wins were true regarding that year nominations. Overall, i really enjoyed 'La La Land'. At some points i could have easily gave this movie 10/10 but it didn't blow me away overall as i hoped it would do, nevertheless this is a very good movie.",9,1,4,28 July 2017
Sinister," scary and very creepy movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.I love horror movies and watch lots of them. As a horror movie fan i can say 'Sinister' is a must watch for all the horror movies fans. 'Sinister' scared the hell out of me - and that's not easy to do. It is as good as 'Insidious', maybe even better. Sinister is one of those scary movies where the story is just as compelling as its scary moments, and the mood in this movie is your worst possible nightmare.The tapes presented to us are some of the most disturbing pieces of footage I have ever seen, and they definitely give a feeling of discomfort to the viewer.Watch this movie, it's really good.",10,3,5,26 January 2013
3 Idiots," No, Thank You.
","Greetings from Lithuania.There are only 3 good things i can say about '3 Idiots' (2009): 1. It was a well-intentioned 2. It was not a bad movie 3. I FINALLY finished watching it.It got me one and half week to actually finish watching this highly overwritten, over acted, Uber-sentimental, highly predictable, over produced tear-jerker, not funny 'good feel' / 'comedy'. The only reason why i even started to watching it was its high position in IMDb Top 250 movies. WHAT is this thing even doing in IMDb Top 250? This year i saw bunch of movies better by many, many, many (and did i said MANY?) moons and oceans then this... 'stuff'. To be honest, i think i know exactly what is this flick doing in IMDb Top 250 - but i will keep my opinion just to not offend anyone. Can't remember last time i had my eyes rolling like every 5-10 min during the whole 'experience'. That said, i don't watch Bollywood movies, this is my probably first one, so maybe here lies the reason why i didn't like it at all. Everything is just so 'offbeat' - and not in a good way. Music is so over written and over used, comedy timing isn't good, although it got me couple of times smiling, this is not a funny movie, well unless... again, i will keep my opinion by myself. Overall, if you are like 10 years old and do like Bollywood movies, you will probably love it, but anyone else beyond that age or those who don't like movie production from that country - stay away, far away from this flick. And one more thing - i kinda doing marathon of movies from IMDb Top 250, and at the moment i saw like ~203 of them and was intended to see them all. Until this moment there wasn't a poor movie to say the least, and lowest score i gave in the past from any movie from IMDb Top 250 was 8. '3 Idiots' is the worst from anything i saw yet, and to think that there are more Bollywood production inside of this great list keeps my head spinning - i don't think i will be able to 'experience' such a movie again, although i still considering to do the list... God have mercy.",5,6,12,3 December 2016
Life Is Beautiful," One of the most beautiful stories ever told on screen
","Greetings from Lithuania.'La vita è bella' (1997) - (what a beautiful title) is the movie itself. It's fascinating in every meaning of this word. I first saw it when i was 13 years old, and i never forgot it. What beautiful piece of art. Like life itself, it's a beauty. Wonderfully acted, directed, paced it takes you to the place, involves you, shakes you to the core, inspires you and lets you go on the beautiful note - heroes can be found in the most unusual places, and true heroes goes unsung. On its core, 'La vita è bella' is a fairytale, but so captivating, so true, so beautifully told it will leave you with eyes wet. It delivers on every aspect. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and every single time it left me speechless. Overall, if you somehow haven't saw this movie, do your self a favor and experience it, that the only word that can be found that sums up this picture, like the life itself it takes no prisoners and after it will over, you feel yourself a little bit ... brighter.",10,1,1,31 October 2014
The Hurricane," Superb movie in all directions
","Grettings from Lithuania.'The Hurricane'(1999) is a superb film, lead by a mesmerizing performance from Mr.Denzel Washington. I saw this gem 3 times already, and it's a heartbreaking movie. It's so moving, that sometimes you can't really keep the tears - and it's definitely not a tearjerker type of movie, but because of the story and again of the powerhouse performance from Denzel, it really works on that front. No one would want to be caught in such a situation, and when watching this film you can't get rid of the mind 'what would i do in this kind of a situation' - i think Ruben did what a Strong person would do - he has locked himself from the inside and throw away the key until one kid finally found it.This i truly great biography, kind a dark but at the same time inspiring story , lead by an amazing performance by one of the all time best - Denzel Washington.",10,2,3,5 August 2014
Woman in Gold," Sentimental, involving and entertaining drama
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Woman in Gold' (2015) is shamefully sentimental, yet very entertaining and at the times moving picture. It tels a real story of a woman who wanted to return a painting stolen by Nazis from her family during WW2. The story takes place mainly in present times, but there is flashback story showing us of how did all happen back in the beginning of WW2.Acting was uniformly good by both leads, but especially by Helen Mirren - man does she also look beautiful at the age of 70! Script is engaging, and director did a very solid job in keeping this movie in pace - at running time 1 h 40 min this movie barely drags and involving from start till finish. Overall, 'Woman in Gold' is a drama, but it's a very entertaining and involving one. It's expertly paced and although it's very sentimental at moments, it's never a 'tearjerker' yet it manages to be moving mainly because of very good acting by Helen Mirren. This is a movie that many will adore. A solid 8/10.",8,0,0,25 June 2015
The Legend of 1900," A descent movie with a heart
","Greetings from Lithuania.'La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano' (1998) is a long epic, kinda forgotten one. I actually did not head anything about this movie but just now, when spotted it for a first time at the bottom of IMDb top 250 movies list. Its a bit crazy that this movie came out basically in the same year as 'Titanic' have, which costed nearly 200 million dollar and this movie just 6.Overall, 'La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano' is a good fantasy story about a man who lived his life entirely on a ship. It sound a bit unrealistic, and this movie is unrealistic but its not tried to be anything else. I found the performances just OK but nothing special. The look of the movie was really good and cinematography was great - surely the music itself which plays a huge role was excellent. While at the running time 2 h 45 min this movie did drag here and there (its a very long movie), i did enjoyed it because of the simplistic story which probably will never be told again on a big screen in the age of superhero movies. This is a good movie all in all, which has a heart in a right place.",8,0,0,10 January 2019
Don't Breathe," Fun flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.To be honest, for the most running time of 'Don't Breathe' (2016) i was kinda rooting for Stephen Lang's character. And why not? He is a a bit old blind man whose house is being robed by three thieves. Should I've been rooting for thieves? No way. Then the movie showed a bit more lets just say 'awkward' side of this blind man, which made him kinda villain. Overall, as there isn't really much to say about this flick i only will say that i was entertained during the whole 1 h 20 min. Its very good paced flick which is entertaining if you can leave your brains for a rest for a while while watching this flick. A pretty good flick.",8,3,7,18 November 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Uneven yet not bad movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.I really did enjoy the first ~45 min. or so of 'Beauty and the Beast' (2017). I was superbly paced, well written, acted and directed movie that didn't felt like a cheezee Disney production. Yet by the end this movie started to drag and it was predictable - ye, i'm talking about 'Beauty and the Beast' being predictable...That said, this is pretty good movie overall. Set design, costumes, even some acting were great. The story here well known, and it doesn't provide anything new or original - you know what your are getting into. Also there a tons of familiar faces (at the end) and voices, but nothing memorable in acting category, although Emma Watson was pretty good here. Overall, 'Beauty and the Beast' wasn't as cheezee as i thought it will be. This is not bad movie even if you didn't adore the story (as i am) nor you like Disney musicals (as i am). Its well paced with some superb production values which makes this movie kinda worth seeing it once.",7,0,1,22 July 2017
Sicario," Great craftsmanship and acting in a bit messy story
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Sicario' (2015) is wonderfully filmed, crafted and acted movie, but storytelling is not it's highest point. Script is very realistic, but plot wasn't very good in my opinion, it is a bit messy story although viewer sees everything from point of view of our heroine, i wan't very engaged in this movie. That said the first 45 min of this movie are after they return from trip from Mexico are highlight of this movie. Cinematography is mesmerizing, surely an Oscar (at least) nominee. Directing was intense, acting is superb by all involved, but i liked Benicio Del Toro's acting in 'Traffic' much more, it is very good performance, but not that great. After ~45 min mark this movie was a bit of a let down, as story becomes more and more murky, maybe a bit straightforward narrating would be better in this case.Overall, 'Sicario' is exceptionally well crafted movie, with great acting ensemble, amazing cinematography, very solid directing, but a bit to complex and difficult to follow plot. It is a very solid movie, but i was expecting a bit more involving one.",8,1,2,30 December 2015
Some Like It Hot," Great film
","Greetings from Lithuania.Weirdly enough i never get to see 'Some Like It Hot' (1959) when it run on TV countless of times. I heard it was a classic, so finally i gave it a chance and saw it on a Blue Ray. ]'Some Like It Hot' is a really great film. It is funny, superbly paced comedy plot of which i won't repeat as it is probably have been known by anyone. Yes there are some 'you got to be kidding me - do they really don't see these are men actually?' moments here, but don't take it seriously - this movie is a true fun.Overall, i can see why 'Some Like It Hot' is considering to be a real classic. It has very good acting (in this kind of movie), is invitingly written, superbly well directed (at running time 2 hours this movie never dragged) and Marilyn Monroe at the top of her 'form ' didn't 'hurt' this movie either - she it the one i couldn't take my eyes of it. All in all this is a great film.",9,0,0,9 April 2017
"McFarland, USA"," Familiar, yet very entertaining picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.It's hard imagine anyone who would not cheer a bit after watching 'McFarland, USA' (2015). This is a true story, and the movie is truly good and sometimes moving. It's inspirational story like you have seen many times actually, but it is made so well that at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never drags and is involving from start till finish.Overall, 'McFarland, USA' is sometimes routine and familiar, yet very entertaining movie. Kevin Costner is good in here, and although no Oscars will shine with this movie, it's nevertheless a very well made picture. Directing was solid - pacing of this movie is great. Music was nice, as well as cinematography. It's not very original picture, but a very fine one.",9,25,29,21 June 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Disappointing
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' (2017) is a very disappointing movie considering that i highly enjoyed first part. What a great movie that was - smart, very funny and spectacular. Second part kinda looks great, there are some good jokes, but far and in between. The plot wasn't as fresh as in a first part, but it was OK. The weakest think in this movie was script, without a doubt. There were characters from first movie, but they were near as funny here as in previous picture. The movie was simply boring. Overall, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' has the looks, but its a mess. Its lacks almost everything that made first movie great fun. Its overproduced and disappointing at the end.",6,3,7,20 August 2017
Titanic," Unforgettable motion picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx 'movies' comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.",10,10,15,8 July 2013

It has really good story - and involving, mysterious and superbly told. Script was very good as well.Overall, 'Tenkû no shiro Rapyuta' is a great movie for children and big ones.

The Shape of Water," Good movie, but not the best of the year
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Shape of Water' (2017) is a beautiful movie. It is beautifully made, beautifully acted, directed and written. I was involved into this story from beginning till the end. This is a beautifully made entertainment. So since when pure entertainment movies are receiving Oscars for best picture of the year? It only shows how inconsistent and all sometimes all over the map Oscar voters can be. This movie hasn't have any dept. For example Michael Shannon's character - although i highly enjoyed acting by everyone involved - he is basically a two dimensional villain. Overall, 'The Shape of Water' is a very good movie to see it once, but its not the best of the year (and i haven't even saw 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' yet - something tells me i'm going to love it much more then this one).",9,10,26,21 April 2018
The Disaster Artist," Great
","Greetings from Lithuania.I highly enjoyed 'The Disaster Artist' (2017) - as much as i thought i will be. Acting was amazing by both leads, script was very good (no wonder it got nominated for Academy award). Directing was also great. This movie shows you what happens when you do something of which you don't have any clue, when your ego is as big as well..Tommy Wiseau - 'The Room' is a perfect example. That 'movie' i saw only once and only to prepare myself for 'The Disaster Artist' - and i wasn't laughing when watching it - i couldn't believe my eyes of how bad it was.Overall, 'The Disaster Artist' is a great movie not only about making 'The Room'. It also shows you that you can pursue your dreams, no matter how hard you can fall after achieving them. There is something for everyone to be learned here.",9,0,1,16 March 2018
It's a Wonderful Life," Good luck in not to cheer after watching this picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'It's a Wonderful Life' (1946) truly deserves all the praises and kudos it got true the decades. Seeing it first time this evening in 2015, all i can say that this is an amazing movie in every term. I won't going to into plot details as you all probably know it better than me. Try not to smile after this movie - it's impossible. This is a movie making at highest level. Acting is outstanding (it was made in 1946!), especially by a lead James Stewart - he glues the whole picture. Supporting cast is also great. Script is so simple yet so rich and combined with pitch perfect directing - near every scene (litteraly) in this movie clicks and it is just marvelous to watch this story unfolding. Before watching this movie i really didn't expect it to be THIS good, thought it could be a bit overrated, but boy was i wrong - this is a must see picture for every age, for every person.Overall, 'It's a Wonderful Life' has to be one of the finest pictures. At running time 2 h 10 min this movie never drags, and is superbly involving from start till the last frame. Every scene works here so well, because of great acting, superb direction, great script (simple, yet very involving). The ending is superbly inspiring. I do wonder however about age of some more old characters in this movie, as it seems like they never get old (and some of them should be at around 120 years old by the end of the movie), but it's not even a complain. Watch this movie if you haven't seen it yet - it is an amazing motion picture.",10,4,8,23 July 2015
A Beautiful Mind," Very good and honest picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'A Beautiful Mind' (2001) is a must see picture to everyone who appreciates great quality dramas. Based on the life of John Nash, it tells a story of love, illness and life itself. Played magnificently by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, this is a superbly crafted movie, terrifically paced and very emotional and touching. R.Crowe should have won Oscar for this performance, as good as Denzel Washington was in 'Training Day' - John Nash isn't Det. Alonzo Harris - these are very different movies, and i think that R.Crowe was a definite winner.Nevertheless, 'A Beautiful Mind' is beautiful movie, inspiring and touching. If somehow you missed it - you should definitely see it if you like great quality movies.",10,1,2,7 December 2014
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Funny
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Tenacious D' (2006) is a truly smart and funny movie, if you like this kind of 'stoned' humor. The story is also kinda 'stoned', but it's good. There are some truly funny cameos, who did great job, and also spotted Amy Adams in one super short scene.Overall, this is the kind of movie where you don't think seriously about the plot, because it is absurd. But if you take the premise, it is a truly funny stuff. Writing is especially good, it kinda captures viewers attention from the opening scene till the end. And the music they played was not that bad actually, which is kinda bad, which is weird as is this funny movie.",8,0,0,13 September 2015

The script by William Monahan is complex, and rich in characters.Stunning work from director Martin Scorsese.

The Witch," Not what i was expecting, but OK movie overall
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The VVitch' (2015) is kinda disappointing flick to start with. It has a very good premise, settings are good, and overall tone was nice, as well as acting by all involved. But the thing that disappointed me was not the very clear narrative. I love when horror movies plays with you straight, like 'The Conjuring' or (my favorite ever) 'The Exorcist', but 'The VVitch' is another type of horror film. It doesn't show you things straight, and i'm not sure that i understood the ending well. I messes with you, but at the end it doesn't have this 'punch line', it's more like a mystery movie then a really horror film.Overall, 'The VVitch' is OK movie, not a mainstream horror picture by any means, so if you like to watch some good creepy horror movie alone by in the late night, it will do it's job in terms of overall tone, but as a horror movie it's a miss. Still, OK movie but not a horror movie experience i was looking for.",7,0,3,8 May 2016

","Greetings from Lithuania.'Jersey Boys' (2014) is very fine motion picture. It's a biopic that tells a story of band named 'The Four Seasons'. The music is very good here, and the actors did a great job of playing it and singing it. 'Jersey Boys' is a solid film of the great Clint Eastwood, far from his best, but a decent one - the man simply can't make a bad picture. If you know this band (i knew couple of song, with 'Can't Take My Eyes Of You' in the first place), you will be surprised of seeing how this band came together, and what background did they come from. Overall, this is a very fine picture, solidly directed, very well acted by almost unknown for actors. It features great songs, but it's not a musical. It's not the most involving biopic i've seen, but a decent one. Recommended.",8,0,0,1 February 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," Mesmerising motion picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Zero Dark Thirty' (2012) is a truly amazing motion picture. From start till end, it's as good as movies can be. I won't lie, first time watching it i was a bit confused during the first part of the story. until they kinda found one particularly interesting house, and from that point, i was simply blown away. The second time i saw this movie couple of days later, to simply catch what i missed - i enjoyed this movie even more. The acting is amazing. Kathryn Bigelow once again did an incredible job of creating this real world, not overwritten, not overacted but as true as it is. I don't know how this film is true to events that really happened, but i believe they were mostly true to what is shown in this movie.Overall, I'm giving 10/10 for 'Zero Dark Thirty' - it's unforgettable motion picture, if you like these kind of pictures - it's surely not for everyone, but if you enjoy not popcorn movies - this gem if definitely for you.",10,1,6,10 October 2014
Steve Jobs," Amazing writing and superb acting makes this a very compelling picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Steve Jobs' (2015) is an superbly acted and amazingly written picture, two great things that makes this movie in which not much actually happens a real joy to watch and to listen to. To be honest i'm not a fan of Steve Jobs, i barely knew his biography. That said i wasn't really looking forward for this movie, i actually even didn't really wanted to see it in the first place. Glad i did, because in the first place this is not a straightforward biopic - there are only few some segments from his life that are shown in this movie, it is more of 'right here right now' stuff of biopic, it shows you man's portrait on the outside, not much of the inside. But as acting and writing goes, this is a top notch experience.Overall, the great Aaron Sorkin, always superb Michael Fassbender and one of the kind Kate Winslet shines in this movie. No surprise Kate Winslet won Goden Globe for this movie, she steals every scene in this movie (before 1998 segment in my opinion). This is very good movie in which nothing really that happens, and yet because of once again the writing and acting you are glued to your screen during the whole time.",9,9,20,13 February 2016
Mudbound," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.Watching 'Mudbound' (2017) is like reading a great novel - it sucks you in and like a great novel never lets you out until the last page. 'Mudbound' (2017) is a superb movie.Directing was superb. acting was more then solid - it was just outstanding by simply everyone involved. But the real thing for which this movie is not to be missed out is the story and the screenplay. Its a very plausible, realistic, absorbing, touching and deep story that i have no doubt has happen thousands of times before, unfortunately. Overall, while 'Mudbound' isn't a perfect movie, its running time 2 h 10 min run like a minute for me. Great craftsmanship, amazing acting and superb story superbly written, this is one of the best movies of 2017. Great movie.",9,1,5,22 May 2018
12 Years a Slave," A very solid film. Is it deserve a Best picture award?
","Greetings from Lithuania.This is a very solid film. Not one of the best movies ever made as you might think when see a Metacritic score, but a really good one. Do i believe it will win an Oscar for the best movie of the year tomorrow? Yes. It will probably win. Do i think it is wort of this award? Tricky question. No, probably not. 'Gravity' was so stunning, so unforgettable, that i barely see any winner except 'Gravity', but the winner will be '12 Years As A Slave' - why? because movies like 'Gravity' don't win, and '12 Years As A Slave' is the most popular 'winner' at the moment, but people after many years will remember 'Gravity'. Nevertheless,'12 Years As A Slave' is very solid, good film. Performances are superb. Direction is also very solid. Art decorations and costumes take you to the place. This film however didn't show me nothing new that i haven't saw in movies about slavery before, but it has some hardly forgettable moments.Overall, this is not the best movie of the year in my opinion, 'Gravity' and 'Nebraska' were better for my, but it probably win, and you should check it out, because it does not have any dull or boring moment and it's a very well crafted and watchable movie. 9/10 for my.",9,1,5,1 March 2014
Joker," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.I will be honest - i did not expected 'Joker' (2019) to be this amazing movie. I saw trailer, i liked it, then read that it is heavily influenced on 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' and thought that its going to be at least an interesting and not by a numbers comic book movie. And i was right - its far from any comic book movie i have seen ever, except for 'Logan' and 'Dark Knight'. Well, know there is a 'Joker'. What made those two films exceptional? Its that they went beyond and in different direction then you conventional PG13 comic book flicks from Marvel. 'Joker' on the other hand is a great character study movie - first thing. If you would remove Gotham city and some characters from Batman universe, this film wouldn't even had anything to do with comic book movies. The other thing is that its just superbly done - this is hands down best movie Todd Phillips has ever made (and i loved first 'Hangover'). Cinematography was gorgeous and very stylish, music was haunting and editing was top notch - this film at its running time 2 h run like wind for me. Oh ye, and then there is the best performance of the year (so far) by Joaquin Phoenix - his Joker i think stands on the same ground with a legendary performance by Heath Ledger - its that amazing, and a bit even more complex because in Dark Knight Joker was a side character - in here he is a central figure, and what a great character that was.Overall, 'Joker' is a great character study movie, and a very unique comic book film. Its different, for sure and make no mistake its great not because its different - its because the bold direction creators have went with it and delivered it full. This is one of the very best films this year so far.",10,11,21,3 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," Good movie, but not that great
","Greetings from Lithuania.'To Kill a Mockingbird' (1962) is very well crafted motion picture. Based on a famous novel (which i didn't read) it tells a story from the point of view of two young children. I won't spoil anything, but the story is not the most original or particularly interesting. Nevertheless, what makes this movie a very good one is it's acting - writing, directing. Overall, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is superbly paced movie, at running time 2 h 9 min. this movie barely drags and due it's great acting and writing is entertaining from start till finish. On the other hand, to find this movie at No.84 in IMDb best movies of all time is a bit not right i think. The film is very good, but it's not that great - it's message here is very simple, yet not that deep. The whole movie is more like a fantasy then reality - but maybe that is how it looks through the eyes of children. Nevertheless. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a very solid movie, but maybe a bit over-hyped.",9,0,2,17 June 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Smart, unexpected and exciting
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Edge of Tomorrow' (2014) is superb film in all directions. Everything works here so well, that i can safely say, this is the best blockbuster of 2014 (although i haven't see 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' yet).First 40 minutes of this picture are outstanding, later plot moves to next step, which is also superbly crafted. The very last ending of this picture wasn't as good as the rest of the movie, but it was OK.I can praise everything in 'Edge of Tomorrow'. Directing is great, acting is very solid, production values are a top notch but the real star of 'Edge of Tomorrow' is script - very smart, very involving, unexpected and really engaging. No wonder, because the script was written by heavy-weighter Christopher McQuarrie - brilliant job in 'Edge of Tomorrow', just brilliant. I was engaged in this film from the very first second till the very last shot, it's that good.Overall, 10/10 for 'Edge of Tomorrow' - brilliant script, superb directing, acting and production values - everything clicks here on full cylinders and although a was a slightly disappointed by the very last ending, nevertheless 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a must see type of entertainment.",10,0,2,5 October 2014
Downfall," Great war movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Der Untergang' (2004) is in my opinion one of the most memorable WW2 movies ever made. And this is because of 3 but crucial parts, in opinion - great directing and writing and mesmerizing performance by a great Bruno Ganz, who made for me personally the best depiction of Adolf Hitler on any media, in my opinion. As the movie is basically telling a story of the last days of Hitler and those surrounding him in a bunker, it also later moves into streets of Berlin, were Soviet soldiers came.Overall, 'Der Untergang' is a great war film, made by Germans , telling their story. Movie does not preach, it just shows you a history. Great film.",10,2,2,8 May 2019
Whiplash," Great and not a typical 'drama' / 'music' genre picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Whiplash' (2014) is one of the best motion pictures in 2014. Superbly acted, sharply written and directed this is a music drama tough and nail biting as a thriller. Actually I can't even remember a recent thriller which had more thrills than this seemingly calm movie about a young music student. J.K. Simmons will surely win an Oscar for this performance - it's superb and keeps the whole movie in tandem. Miles Teller is great here, playing a music student who will stop at nothing to become great. The supporting cast doesn't have much screen time, but does the best while on screen. Overall, 'Whiplash' is 10/10 motion picture experience. Great music, superb acting, directing and writing accompanied by terrific sound design - this is a must see for all who appreciate a truly great movies.",10,0,2,7 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," What was the point / moral of this picture?
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Wolf of Wall Street' (2013) i a very entertaining picture. At a ruining time 180 minutes (literaly) it grabs you with terrific acting, top notch directing, script, settings and doesn't let go till the very end. If you wan't to be entertained for 3 hours watching movie, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is not to be mist. But here is the question. What is the moral of this movie? Almost every movie has one. Maestro Martin Scorsese shows you once again that he is a true living movie legend, one of the very best, in not the best. But really, what was the point of the movie? Greed? We saw it many times, in more true way. Or maybe the point was that not everyone can handle the fortune they have? Overall, 9/10 for 'The Wolf of Wall Street' - it's true great movie, with brilliant director on the top, top notch acting all around and just great movie-making, but after 3 hours, and many days after seeing this picture the question to me remained - what was the point?",9,0,1,10 October 2014
Con Air," Great action flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Con Air' (1997) is pretty damn awesome action movie. The setting is great, characters are bigger then life as well as our hero. There isn't uninteresting character in this movie - characters are actually one of the strongest part in this movie.Action scenes are awesome as well. The ending now looks a bit dated, but back in 1997 landing in the streets of Las Vegas looked super cool, as well as car being dragged by plane.There are excellent one-liners, very solid acting by all involved - everyone has definitely had a good time on the set and enjoyed their bad guys characters a lot. Overall, if you somehow have missed this action flick, watch it. It is one of N.Cage's best movies, it is superbly dumb and entertaining action film you will find.",9,3,4,23 August 2015
It Chapter Two," Fast paced, funny and superbly crafted movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.I really liked the entire running time 2 h 45 min (!) of 'It Chapter Two' (2019). This maybe is one of my favorite movies this year, period. It has superbly involving acting, very good and a lot of well timed humor, great villain and superb craftsmanship. This is a monster horror type movie. There are tons of special effects, which does take a away a real horror as usual, but in this movie effects were done tastefully - clearly director of this movie was inspired by Sam Raimi's creations like 'Drag Me to Hell' (2009) and even 'Evil Dead' original movies, because sometimes (many times) 'It Chapter Two' went absolutely crazy and those moments could have derailed the whole experience, but luckily it didn't and this film was a bold and original and fuxxxing insane.Overall, i did enjoyed 'It Chapter Two' very much, without expectations. I loved the first film, and really enjoyed this one. Its a damn helluva, crazy ride.",9,7,11,6 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Good and involving move about ... nothing
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Hail, Caesar!' (2016) was surprisingly very involving movie. At running time 1 h 40 min it never dragged and was surprisingly involving from start till finish. The plot is ... well that is another topic, not for this review. Basically it is about a movie business, and one star who is kidnapped, but there was much more going on. But can someone tell me what was the point of this story? I didn't get it.Overall, 'Hail, Caesar!' has many very well know faces, who has pretty much cameos or extended cameos, but you won't call them as real full performances. Everyone did their uniformly good jobs. Script was also good and involving, i did enjoy this movie which is very clearly told and sometimes funny, but it is not a mainstream comedy. Good movie overall, but probably not for everyone.",8,0,1,9 August 2016
Hancock," Excellent summer movie ride!
","Greetings from Lithuania.I just came back from a cinema and i can tell you people, this is a hell of a summer movie fun! It's even better than i expected! Will Smith is great as usual. SGI are breathtaking. Jokes are great! And - what a surprise, it's a nice quality drama at a moments. Don't get my wrong - it won't going to win an Oscar for directing, neither for script. But as a summer blockbuster - it's excellent, fun, great ride.Buy the way, it's not your typical 'superhero' movie, where the good guy is 'pure' and 'beautifule' like a Superman. Enjoy!P.S. 'Say as...e one more time!!!'",9,15,25,9 July 2008
Kong: Skull Island," OK monster flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Kong: Skull Island' (2017) is a disappointing movie if you compare it to Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' (2005) which was without a doubt - best Kong movie ever made. 'Kong: Skull Island' on the other hand is just a monster flick with Kong in it. Kong doesn't have any personality here nor did i had any feeling towards him - i didn't care if he nor anyone else survived here - and this is the worst part of the movie - so many great actors but there isn't anyone who i would remember, except for John C. Reilly - he delivered and stole every scene he was into. I really liked first ~30 min of this movie when they were setting this story, which wasn't original nor great, but it was done very well and thought 'oh were are in for a ride!'. But when that ride has begun, it was done so unfocused, so kinda badly edited that i almost missed when Kong made his entrance - poor pacing and editing. And after that 'Kong: Skull Island' become very simple, not original, not highly involving monster flick in which i didn't really care about the outcome.Overall, 'Kong: Skull Island' is a big budget monster flick with very good special effects, some nice action scenes, setting but that is pretty much it. It is a disappointing movie considering it has one of the most iconic movie monster ever, and you don't give a damn about him watching it. Not bad flick to see it once with some friends and beer, but unfortunately nothing more.",7,2,3,2 July 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Very good conclusion of a trilogy
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' (2014) is good ending to a trilogy and a fine link to the 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy. It's spectacular, big, involving and etc. There are a lot of CGI in this movie, and although they weren't really special, they were OK. This is the first movie which wasn't nominated for Oscar in special effects category and you can see why, some of the CGI is not the best that we saw in series, and some shoots are even poor. Nevertheless, they don't distract from the movie - without them it would be impossible to create such a vision. The movie which runs for 2 h 17 min is superbly paced and never drags. Overall, 'The Battle of the Five Armies' is a heavy action oriented installment - there are plenty of action scenes and fights and they pretty spectacular and involving, especially that wight at the end one on one. The end of the battle kinda felt rushed a bit, with no real ending of the battle shown. Nevertheless, this movie is a very fine installment and it delivers. The last scene is love letter to all fans.",9,1,3,12 April 2015
Inception," And the Oscars goes to ... A Masterpiece.
","Greetings from Lithuania.Now that was something... I simply out off words, after watching this one. This is going to sound very familiar, but this film was insanely brilliant. This was probably the best experience i had in a movies - ever.As much as 'Avatar' was breathtaking experience in visuals, 'Inception' is a breathtaking experience in storytelling. Everything in this movie works on the level of masterpiece - and i mean - everything! I didn't completely understood all aspects of the film in the first viewing (and i don't thing anyone did) - but this film blew my away.As much as i love 'The Dark Knight', i think 'Inception' is better film. Watch this film, way you still can, because after 20 years, this is going to the be classic like '2001' and 'Blade Runner' - it's THAT good.By the way, the zero-gravity scene in the hotel so reminded my of '2001' - the music, cinematography, the feeling... the masterpiece.",10,1,8,20 September 2010
Finding Dory," Fun adventure, both don't expect to witness a magic of the first one
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Finding Dory' (2016) was a very colorful, fun and always entertaining animated feature. Surely it isn't as smart and amazing as the 'Finding Nemo' (2003) was, this one is more to kids. As crazy as it sounds, the first movie was more realistic (did i just said that?) and smart, this one takes its premise more optimistic and one over the top adventure follows another. Script was pretty OK, it has its moments and it is sometimes funny, but more this is just a sweet and very colorful adventure to the youngest audience.Overall, i enjoyed 'Finding Dory'. Voice acting was superb, visuals were amazing and there were some interesting and very impressive 'action' sequences ('Hands!'). All in all this is fun and very good movie to the youngest ones but their parents won't be amazed as it was 13 years ago with one of the best animated movies ever 'Finding Nemo'.",8,4,12,30 October 2016
Arrival," Science Fiction Movie Heaven
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Arrival' (2016) is without a doubt the best, most sophisticated and deepest sci-fi movie since 'Interstellar' (2014). I was simply blown away first of all from the presentation (not the premise, which lets just say isn't very unique, but that is just at the beginning) and later the, well everything else. The overall story in here is very powerful, not simple by any means and the one which i confess is a bit to hard to swallow at the end. It was sad but at the same time hopeful, and the reason for the arrival itself - no spoilers here - is amazing. Finally, a great sci-fi movie not about destruction. Directing by Denis Villeneuve was amazing. What a scope and skill to show it. Like i said, presentation of this movie is amazingly good. Music was so haunting and so beautiful at the same time. Script wasn't predictable for a second. I loved each and every scene aboard the spaceship, they could have lasted longer. This is an 'aliens' movie so smart and so plausible like i haven't seen since 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' - it is that good, it is not 'Independence Day' by any means. Acting was also superb, with Amy Adams giving her probably the best performance yet.Overall, i do believe that 'Arrival' will be a major Oscar contender this year, because it is way to good to be ignored for its genre. It's so much more then just 'aliens' movie, the one that is so sad but at the same time gives a hope and willingness to take what is the most beautiful and precious for a human being. Great movie and a pure sci-fi movie heaven.",10,5,19,14 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," One Of The Most Inspiring And Beautiful Movies Of All Time
","Greetings from Lithuania.It is very hard to call 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994) a masterpiece, but it is a definitely one of the most inspiring and beautifully crafted picture off all time. That said, i won't going into details, as plot and everything about this movie is so well known. To simply put, this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption. Seeing this movie ~ 5 times in my life i can say that when some time passes, you kinda feel a need to re-watch it again, because this movie is like a journey itself, with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is. I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free - it is a powerful film making so say the least.Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at running time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when action takes place inside the prison and there isn't mainstream action at all. Good things never get old, and 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one the fainest examples.",10,1,1,20 September 2015
Parasite," Amazing, brilliant and just one of the few very best in 2019
","Greetings from Lithuania.Gisaengchung (2019) ('Parasite') is to simply put - the best South Korea'n movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i thing that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion.'Gisaengchung' is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that 'hooked' me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, 'Gisaengchung' is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with 'Joker' which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. Its a universal theme.And this movie is a universal treasure.",10,24,41,9 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Bold, superbly acted but not for everyone's taste
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Birdman' (2014) is surely a movie you won't forget soon after watching it. It's structure is bold, acting is superb by all involved, directing, script are first rate. What makes it fresh and kinda unique is the way how director Alejandro González Iñárritu has constructed it. Filmed seemingly with ~16 cuts per whole movie, it creates and illusion that it was film almost entirely in one shoot. The camera always follows our main character Riggan as well as sometimes his daughter. It looks very interesting. Acting here is first rate. Michael Keaton gives a standout performance, and although i don't think he will win Oscar for this picture, this is a superb performance. There are total 3 Oscar nominations for performances in this movie, and everyone does a great job in for filing this idea.Overall, 'Birdman' is a very good picture. It has fresh, interesting and bold feel, it looks and sounds great and although it doesn't show us very original story, it does this in such an interesting way that at running time almost 2 hours i never was bored nor this movie dragged. It's superbly paced, and although this picture is not for everyone, it will definitely wort seeing.",9,1,7,16 February 2015
The Big Short," Superbly involving movie mostly because of amazing acting and electrifying script
","Greetings from Lithuania.Although i do not really know this world that the movie takes us into, and 'AAA' didn't rang a bell at the beginning of the movie, 'The Big Short' has such a great acting and electrifying script, that it grabbed my attention from the beginning till the very last end, although there were many moments were i didn't understood how exactly that or that works. Hey, but don't worry, Margot Robbie in a bubble bath and Selena Gomez will explain some more innovating term to you - hilarious stuff.Overall, 'The Big Short' is just a great movie. Every actor (especially Steve Carell and Christian Bale) shines in this movie, and because of great acting and superbly involving yet not easy script this movie was a blast. Highly recommended - but not for everyone.",9,4,5,30 March 2016
The Conjuring," Good movie and beyond
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Conjuring' is good film, where everything works - story, acting, directing, music, camera work and horror. And it's not easy to combine all these elements to work - we saw lots of bad examples. 'The Conjuring' gives us usual setting - scary house where 'something' is wrong. Aside from the fact that this is the most usual place for horror story, this movie works. First of all - acting is really good in this film - lead women did a great job. There are scary moments, but before watching this film i thought there will be more of them, nevertheless they are really good, and if you in a mood for good scares - 'The Conjuring' can give you some truly chills. This film is a must see to all horror fans and to all movie lovers.One more thought. I think that the last 3 years are golden age of horror movies in Hollywood. Think of it, in the last 3 or 4 years they produced some terrific horror pictures. The good one 'Insidious', the amazing 'Sinister' and now 'The Conjuring' - these are all wonderful horror movies, equal to gems that we saw from the late 70's. I really looking forward to what comes next.",9,1,3,24 October 2013
Platoon," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Platoon' (1986) is without a doubt Oliver Stone's best film. It's easily the most accurate Vietnam War movie ever made, and one of a few best. Fighting sequences are done in a way like you are always in the center of fight, rather just watching it from outside. There are many good actors here, and all of them did a great job. Directing is also terrific - it's definitely directors most straightforward movie, without all the fancy or stylized editing - it's just a great film making on all accounts.Overall, 'Platoon' is a great war movie and one the few best in it's genre. Craftmenship is terrific - once seen this movie is impossible to forget one. A true classic.",10,3,4,19 June 2016
Prometheus," Great Sci-Fi Epic
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Prometheus' (2012) is a great sci-fi thriller, adventure epic. It works as a prequel to 'Alien' as well as standalone story. Production values are first rate. Cast was great and everyone did uniformly good job with Michael Fassbender stealing every scene he is in. Many disliked this film because it plays in many genres - it is one of the rare sci-fi movies which can be safely placed under adventure, thriller and even horror sci-fi movies. Overall, 'Prometheus' can be uneven, but it is a great sci-fi movie which has a big scope, plays with big ideas and doesn't forget to show some chilly moments - all wrapped up in a terrific production values. Can't wait for a sequel.",10,2,6,31 August 2016
The Water Diviner," Not without it's flaws, but very enjoyable movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Water Diviner' (2014) is a guilty pleasure. Uneven, yet very enjoyable movie almost till the end. First half of this movie was superb, surprisingly highly involving, very skilfully made and very intriguingly written. At the end it kinda lost it's road with ending somehow easily and bit on the 'adventurous mode'. That said, 'The Water Diviner' is very good directorial debut by a great Russell Crowe. The man also stars in a lead role and goes on a journey at the end of WW1 to find his three missing sons in a Galipoli war, known as one of the bloodiest battles in a 20 century. There isn't much of war battles in this movie, although there are some, and they are done well here and serves more to story as well as shows the gritty war side.Overall, 'The Water Diviner' is a good movie. It's has very involving, intriguing, sad and very well told story, although this story loses a bit at the end. The thing i didn't like was Olga Kurylenko - she's is very pretty but i think she is overrated, i don't have anything against her but it's hard to take it seriously to see model Olga Kurylenko always with a perfect makeup in Turkey during WW1, it's just odd casting. Isabel Lucas had a very small but surprisingly good role. Russell Crowe was OK / good but nothing special. Overall i can recommend this movie because you will definitely will enjoy this for the most part. At running time almost 2 hours this movie never drags, and that is a big plus to Russell Crowe direction.",8,5,15,24 March 2015
Wonder Woman," Entertaining and very well made
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Wonder Woman' (2017) was surprisingly entertaining movie. As not the biggest fan of superhero movies, i did enjoy this film for what it was. It has a really involving story, and was made with crystal clear vision. Acting was very good by everyone involved, and script, directing and cinematography were top notch. And while this movie does not invent the new wheel, it was surprisingly good for what it was. Overall, 'Wonder Woman' is pure entertainment. It is involving and superbly crafted movie.",9,2,3,1 January 2018
Paths of Glory," Incredible
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Paths of Glory' (1957) is a stunning motion picture. It's about war, it's about life, it's about immeasurable things. What is courage? What is glory in the face of death? How to measure it? Can it be measured? Does courage or cowordness can be judged? These are just a few questions this movie brilliantly asks. And there is no sure answer. Watching this movie i was stunned how interesting and involving it is. It's superbly acted, directed and amazingly written war drama, that isn't much about the combat, but more of what consequences it brings. I'm still not sure whether the court itself was moral. It's yes and no at the same. If there were no court, many soldiers would have followed by example of those who didn't fight (as it was their responsibility - they are soldiers), and they would have surely lost war, which would ended by deaths for millions. On the other hand, the court itself was just a reminder, of why war itself is the most inhuman thing of them all.Overall, one couldn't summarize this movie and especially it's ideas in one summary. This is anti war movie that raises questions, and as they are eternal, there are no black or white answers to them. 'Paths of Glory' is a must see motion picture for everyone and for all ages. It's a damn perfect classic.",10,0,1,21 February 2015
Marriage Story," A solid drama with amazing performances
","Greetings from Lithuania.Best things about 'Marriage Story' (2019) was phenomenal acting and a good script. The story itself lets just say nothing original or new, but hey, that is a movie about life. About marriage and divorce. And raising a child in a middle of it.What I'm pretty sure about this movie of is that Scarlett Johansson is going to win an Oscar for it - this is her performance of a lifetime. She was nothing short of amazing in here - some monologs that lasted about 10 min. where she goes trough all possible emotions is the best acting I have seen this year. Adam Driver was very good and he should get a nomination.Overall, 'Marriage Story' is a very solidly written and directed movie, with some stellar performances. I see here two or three Oscar nominations worthy performances, and a locked win by Johansson.",8,5,8,30 December 2019
1408," Superb Horror Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.I loved '1408' (2007) for both viewing i have had of this picture. It was superbly simple yet effective story, but its the writing by Matt Greenberg and superb directing by Mikael Håfström who carried this movie. Sure the performance by Samuel L. Jackson was uniformly good, but it was of course John Cusack's vehicle to say the least - he is just superb in this role. I loved how they made a very involving set up and didn't let it go until the very end, which maybe could have been a bit better, stick more closely to the movie we saw before. Nevertheless, '1408' is a very involving and a truly scary movie, surely not to be missed by the fans (and not only by them) of the genre. Great horror flick.",9,1,2,17 November 2016
Raging Bull," Great, intense picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Raging Bull' (1980) is a very good picture, great one (like you haven't heard about it yet). It contains superb performances by all involved, and especially by the great Robert De Nido in a lifetime performance. It's gritty, ugly, true and very intense picture, with a great director in his best form - every scene in this picture pulse on tension. Boxing scenes are very disturbing, they are short, and very brutal - although this picture is filmed in black and white, it's look stunning. Overall, a true gem, called by many the best picture of the 80's. I don't think it's that good, and there are many pictures that i would call equally great, but this one is not to be mist my a true movie lovers.",9,2,2,17 September 2014
Mary and Max," Great
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Mary and Max' (2009) is a unique and very good movie. It's not animation in a mainstream way, but a very complex and unique picture. The screenplay is amazing. It's simple, yet very rich and unexpected in it's way. You won't see such a greatly written animation very often. It's also not for children, it's not gory and there are no swear, only it's themes are not for kids, they won't be entertained during this movie.Overall, a very solid 9/10 for 'Mary and Max', it's sure owns it's plays here on IMDb 250, it's a unique animation, with a superb screenplay, very solid voice work and amazing settings.",9,0,2,16 October 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," It's good to be a billionaire
","Greetings from Lithuania.Yep, if you are dude, watching this movie you will get a feeling that it's damn good to be a billionaire. You have a great flat. Superb Office, car, you can do whatever you want in a middle of a day without worrying for your job. And you can take a girl on whatever date you can imagine.Here is advice, if you are on your first date, DO NOT go watch this movie with your date, because you will kinda feel awkward of seeing the things that you won't probably give to your date.'Fifty Shades of Grey' is a very nicely made product for a target audience. It's nicely wrapped looking candy - nothing more. The movie itself isn't bad as you could thought from seeing rating here at IMDb. I know why it's so low - because it isn't a great movie nor it's an art nevertheless it's crazy popular and people are usually hate these things. If this is a romance of 21 century than please take me back to 20 century were there were movies like 'English Patient' or 'Titanic' or even 'Nine 1/2 Weeks'.Overall, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' isn't some bad porn - it's a soft erotic romance, which looks nice and doesn't want to be anything more. It's nicely paced, at running time 2 h this movie surprisingly does not drag, it has nice and very professional cinematography, very solid acting by lead female, kinda lame but not that bad script. It's not Oscar material, but for one viewing it will do it's job. When it's over you will forget it very fast though.",7,0,2,6 May 2015

Everything works here on highest level, script, acting, directing, technical craftsmanship. The practical effects look amazing, especially at the end during the chase through the streets - it looks real as it gets. Take this movie alone, and it is by miles and many moon better then any of marvel movies put together - it is that good. Overall, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a great movie. It has everything that a mainstream entertainment has to have, and it keeps you entertained from start till very last scene. Terrific ending of the best superhero franchise ever.",10,1,6,16 August 2015

The great Ryan Coogler did an amazing job with this movie - its superbly paced - at running time 2 h 15 min i was entertained from the beginning till end. Overall, 'Black Panther' is a superbly crafted movie which is simply fun to watch. Great movie all around.",9,1,2,5 August 2018
Iron Man," The One that started it all
","Greetings from Lithuania.Its kinda hard to believe that 10 years have already past since 'Iron Man' (2008) hit the screens and started it all. If this movie would have failed, we might have been missing today the whole generation of superhero movies - good that or bad, 'Iron Man' is a splendid entertainment. Robert Downey Jr. made half of the movie's success, and the rest is a great job by Jon Favreau. This was the movie that really worked on all accounts - it has good and involving story, great characters, action and writing.Overall, 'Iron Man' should be considered as a classic now of Marvel universe. The one highly successful movie that started it all for Marvel. And it still is a damn fine entertainment.",9,0,0,12 November 2018
Mother!," A bold and unique movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.With 'Mother!' (2017) the bold and unique director Darren Aronofsky has not disappointing in my opinion. I always highly enjoyed his movies, and this one is not exception. Surely 'Mother!' is not for everyone. While i did enjoyed performances very much as well as script, to be honest, after watching this movie i had to read about what director himself has said about it - simply to understand what was really was it point. I got the idea when watching it, but some explanations didn't hurt for sure. Overall, 'Mother!' is absolutely bold and unique movie. No wonder many hated it, but i found it kinda fascinating. In these years of many predictable and made only for one reason (money) movies 'Mother!' truly stands out as a unique, ambitious and bold movie.",8,1,5,26 February 2018
Creed II," Keep them coming
","Greetings from Lithuania.I guess i will never be tired of 'these Rocky movies'. While not as amazing as first Creed movie, 'Creed II' (2018) delivered everything i was hoping for - big and great speeches about life, great boxing scenes, great villains (Dolph in one of his best performances ever) and mumbling Sly with his hat. Villains in this movie were probably the best in all Rocky movies because for the first time i was rooting for them as much as for our heroes - they are superbly flashed out characters.Overall, i really enjoyed 'Creed II'. Considering that this is 8th movie in a series, it a sort of a miracle this franchise is still attracts millions. Thank you Sly for this movie and this whole franchise of one of the (if not the most) inspiring movie franchise in a cinema history.",8,0,1,9 March 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The Most Epic, Complex, Visually Arresting Superhero Movie Since 'The Dark Knight' Trilogy
","Greetings from Lithuania.This is a short review of the 'Extended, Ultimate Cut'. I didn't saw the theatrical version.So. Afer so much hype and some much negativity (mainly) since the release of the 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' i found (not entirely to my surprise) that this movie is, simply - amazing. I haven't been looking to see 'Extended, Ultimate Cut' (and this is the only version i have seen and it was on my 2m x 2m Blue Ray projector meant for watching movies with all the sound system ready to roll) to be this rich, complex, visually stunning movie. This is the most 'In Your Face Marvel flicks (except for the first 'Iron Man' and 'Guardians of The Galaxy' which were great)' superhero movie i was waiting, although i kinda didn't knew i was. This is a splendid movie from the get-go. The story itself is so epic, so big in it's scale and scope that it should put to a shame all other superhero movies currently in a market. Ben Affleck absolutely kills it as a Batman. As much as i love Christian Bale's interpretation as the Caped Crusader, the latest performance by Ben Affleck is as stunning as it is. All other performances were superb, on spot. Directing is amazing - not a dragging second for a pure almost 180 minutes. One of the many things i did enjoyed in this movie first off all was the complex and rich story. This is as far as it goes from the 'first act (when our hero is being introduced), second act (when this hero becomes a 'super-dude') and the third act (when this super-dude meets 'super-bad-villian' and lots of things and people (which are never shown) are being blown off for real good). Action scenes were superb - it is very clear that many of the scenes were created as real as it gets - many real size locations, models - and it enriches this world, and makes it real and plausible (and were are talking about a movie named 'Batman v Superman'(!)). Overall. If you are a fan of 'one time seeing superhero flicks from one major company were are all know' - this picture isn't for you. And to summarize it: please. Warner Bros - bring us superhero movies like this more often and like you did with this picture: take your time. Enrich it, make it look as real and plausible and gritty as it gets. Make it's running time not according to a simultaneously ending popcorn box of a 'fan boys' in multiplexes, but a one that reveals its story and superbly creates new dimensions for a sequels - sooner or later you will get your money back with a profit. 'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Extended Ultimate Edition' is the closest movie that reminded me of THE best superhero trilogy off all time 'The Dark Knight'. It is one of the years best films. Now you can start throwing rocks at me.",10,23,39,9 July 2016
Ben-Hur," Simply Amazing
","Greetings from Lithuania.WOW. This is the first word that comes to the mind after credits of this movie starts rolling. Terrific story, spellbinding craftsmanship, acting, music - everything works here on the highest order. It's so much more that a simple epic, yet witnessing this movie first time in 2015, 'epic' seems was born with 'Ben-Hur' 1959.There isn't anything new that i can add in praising review of this magnificent motion picture. If you haven't seen it yet, and maybe afraid of it's release date or length - don't be - this is amazingly entertaining epic / adventure / drama which doesn't feel or look dated a bit. And this kind of story won't age, it's timeless. Overall, 11 Oscars (first off three movies with this amount awards) proves, that they weren't sparing when creating this piece. Every scene looks astonishingly even now, that is because it was a pre-CGI era, and we can only be thankfully for this. In this movie i saw so many things that later were copied in another epics (especialy 'Gladiator') - and what was surprising to me - i liked this movie more that 'Gladiator' - it is THAT good. Watch this film - it is amazing in every aspect.",10,0,2,6 July 2015
La Vie En Rose," Good movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'La Vie en Rose' (2007) is a good period piece and great biopic movie. This movie had a great boost because of mesmerizing performance by Marion Cotillard. It tells a story about a great singer, and her hard life. It has great sets which kinda brings you into the time and place. Directing was very good as well as script.Overall, 'La Vie en Rose' is a very solid movie that surprised me of how this famous singers life was - hard as hell. But all in all this is very solid movie.",8,0,0,16 October 2018
Bull Durham," Good, easy and enjoyable movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Bull Durham' (1988) is about baseball and about falling in love. Sounds corny, but it's all about that actually. It works both, it not a deep romantic story, but it sure knows a lot about baseball. Performces are very good in here, especially by Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon. Susan Sarandon should have been probably even considered for Oscar for best role, she is that good in here. Kevin Costner is more or less is Kevin Costner is here, which is also a good thing.Overall, 'Bull Durham' is a very enjoyable romantic sports movie. Story is very simple, and the approach to it is also easy and enjoyable. At running time 1 h 40 min this movie barely drags and it's an entertaining easy ride.",8,0,0,16 August 2015
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," A tale about love and finding yourself wrapped in a good movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' (2008) is all about settings, love and finding your true self. Oh, and it's a good movie too. Set in beautiful and gorgeous locations it's a very well acted, directed and scripted movie. Sometimes it looked so organic and natural - you can see it and feel it only in Woody Allen's movies. It's another very good picture by a true movie maestro. It's not a comedy, but it has some funny moments.Overall, 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a really good picture. It has real and beautiful settings, actors who playing great and relaxed, good script and great director over the wheel. It's not a typical Woody Allen's comedy, this one explores love and finding yourself through love. All performances are great, especially by Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz - they are true joy to watch.",8,0,0,13 January 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," A very sweet film
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Saving Mr. Banks' (2013) is a very sweet, heart warming film. I haven't see Mary Poppins (1964), but it didn't distracted me from watching 'Saving Mr. Banks' - you don't have to see or read an actual Mary Poppins to like this film, although if did see the movie and read the book, than 'Saving Mr. Banks' is not to be missed. The acting is great, especially from Emma Thompson who steals the show as P.L. Travers, the author of 'Mary Poppins'. Other actors did a solid job. The score of this film is very good, very uplifting and sets the mood of the entire picture. And the story itself of 'Saving Mr. Banks' was a very involving, it actually tells two stories simultaneously and both of them are interesting and kinda moving. Overall, i give 'Saving Mr. Banks' 9/10 for a great acting, terrific score, interesting and true story, good directing. After this film has ended, i thought of seeing a 1964 classic by myself. A very solid film.",9,0,1,10 August 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Very good movie with tears and laughs
","Greetings from Lithuania.I really liked 'Jojo Rabbit' (2019) for its good humor, touching story and third act which was pretty perfect in my opinion. This movie has reminded me of 'Life is Beautiful', which is a good thing as that one i consider one of my all time favorites.Overall, there are tears and there are laughs in 'Jojo Rabbit'. It is a superbly written, acted and directed movie. Really good one.",9,8,12,18 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Not quite reaches the highs of 'La vita è bella', but a great movie of its own
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Jojo Rabbit' (2019) is a movie during which i constantly told myself - this is the closest thing to 'La vita è bella' i saw since that movie - because i love 'Life is Beautiful'. The only reason i did not find 'Jojo Rabbit' perfect was that slapstick humor in the first half of the movie and a bit to much of 'Jews are not different from others revelations in the middle'. And i'm OK by that, it was pretty good, but later events of this film transpired its first half. The second half, and more of the 3rd act was simply perfect.Overall, i loved 'Jojo Rabbit' second half. while its first half was just good. In a any way, this is a really good movie, superbly written and acted and directed.",9,0,0,16 February 2020
Speed," It hardly gets better than this
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Speed' is a real action classic. Everything in this movie works. Action sequences are great, effects top notch even in this time, chemistry between actor is solid, script is great for this kind of movie. This movie grabs you from the opening titles till the very last end - and you can count these kind of movies on one hand. Keanu Reeves is brilliant straightforward action hero in 'Speed'. Sandra Bullock is great also. This is an action film for the ages - it's doesn't get old. This is one of my favorite action films of all time. If you still haven't see it (i hardly imagine that this possible) - do as fast as you can.",10,0,1,13 July 2013
Son of Saul," Good movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Saul fia' (2015) is a movie you won't forget soon. It's a story of one men struggles to find some inner peace in the eye of the madness and living hell. Shoot with almost documentary style, camera never leaves its perspective of showing things from the point of view of Saul, we witness events as purely as he is. It creates this tension, which sometimes is unbearable, but at the same time i'm not sure i liked this style of cinematography, i would prefer to see some things from side.Overall, 'Saul fia' reminded me of another terrific and haunting movie about the same place and time - 'The Grey Zone' (2001). If you liked this one, you should see 'Saul fia' but be ware that this is not a movie for everyone.",8,0,3,8 August 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," One of the best action movie of the decade
","Greetings from Lithuania.Die Hard 4.0 (as it is known in Europe) is simply, simply on of the the best action movies ever. This said, i must admit that i'm a huge 'Die Hard' fan. I watched all three films many many times. When 'Die Hard 4.0'_came, i wasn't prepared for this kind of intense, amazing action film. Safe to say now, this is probably the best movie of this franchise since original ( and i loved the third one).I understand that some people think this isn't so good movie, but it really is a fantastic piece of action / adventure.If you're a fan of the Die Hard movies, this movie will blow you away.One can respect and admire Len Wiseman's style of direction and his ability to coordinate impressive action sequences. B. Willis is perfect hero for this kind of stuff.Overall, this is a breathtaking action movie in every aspect.",10,0,2,16 February 2013
Lucy," Don't do drugs
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Lucy' (2014) isn't as sophisticated as it might seem after seeing it, basically, it's action flick with some big speeches about existence, time, space, gravity etc. And although it's a bit refreshing to have these things in action movie, they don't use them very deep - it's more of a style then actual meaning or plot devise. First part of 'Lucy' was fun, the second one for me - not so much, because when they have moved to 'Transcendence' territory it wasn't so much fun because i never buy it as serious stuff. 'Lucy' isn't sci-fi gem, it's simply action movie with some unusual writing - that's it.Overall, 'Lucy' isn't your typical action flick, because it has some sci-fi (more 'fi' then sci) stuff in action movie that you kinda won't see coming. It doesn't have big ideas, it only has big speeches about ides and it's a bit unique to hear them in seemingly typical action flick, which at the end is just an action flick. Not a bad one for one viewing if you ask me.",7,3,8,30 November 2014
The Sixth Sense," One Of My All Time Favorite Movies
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Sixth Sense' (1999) was one of those movies i couldn't get enough during upon its release almost 17 years ago. The mystery, performances, script, directing, horror and THAT unforgettable and once in a lifetime twist at the end that left me speechless - this is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. This is still the best movie M. Night Shyamalan has ever created, and seeing his movies now, he will probably unfortunately won't top this one. That said, i liked many his movies post 'The Sixth Sense', but nothing came closed in comparison to this masterpiece. Overall, as you have probably seen this movie more then once, there isn't anything new that can be said about it. It's definitely one the best movies of all time i think, that works equally good as a mystery, horror, drama and character study. One of the kind movie experience.",10,1,3,9 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Superb entertainment
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015) is a blast off entertainment from start till finish. I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, so i kinda wasn't in the whole hype surrounding this sequel, but nevertheless i was also caught but all the fuzz, saw the trailers more then once and was waiting and wanting for this movie. I saw this movie with couple of friend who are a true Star Wars fans, and they were a bit disappointed by this movie. They complained that is made not much sense as a sequel, and maybe wasn't even true sequel, but from my point of view, it did many things that a sequel, which budget is 200 000 000$ and much of the new franchise's right owners future is at stake, right. It plays safe in terms of story, it is visually stunning movie (Oscar award without doubts), features tons of action, plenty of very good humour, returning iconic characters, some moving scenes and combine it with some nostalgic moments - this is a winner. Overall, as not a Star War fan i give this movie 10/10. I do believe, that if i would have been a 'fanboy', score would have been lover. It has almost everything that a fun and great popcorn entertainment must have - simple and sharp characters, tons of action, superb effects, great humour, interesting (even if not very menacing villains), involving story and a sense of nostalgic to a previous movies if you have seen them. Next movie is scheduled for 2017. Can't wait.",9,7,34,23 December 2015
Flight," Great drama, character study & more
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Flight' is a great movie. Terrific performance by Denzel Washington and great supporting stuff from all involved around. This is a movie making at it's best. The opening sequence is breathtaking and also it has amazing production. Flight, a terrifically exhilarating film, hits all the right notes as a thriller and as a complex drama. A large part of the praise for this film goes to Zemeckis' professional direction (hey, this guy's roots are in Lithuania!)Not usually we see great addiction dramas with performances like in 'Flight'. Outstanding, A must see.",9,2,4,27 January 2013
Unbroken," Inspirational and superbly crafted picture
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Unbroken' (2014) is a superbly crafted movie by a very talented people behind the camera. In script department you have Coen brothers and two other heavyweights - and it feels here - script is believable (yes, i know it's based on true life and adapted from a book), involving and inspiring but not overdone. Cinematography by a legendary Roger Deakins (who was nominated for 12 Oscars in his carrier!) is superb, gorgeous, capturing everything from wide and tight angles and has this classical feel of the movies - 'Unbroken' has to witnessed on the big screen. The actors, who most are little known did a great job. When you have this kind of material and this caliber of people in front and behind the camera, it's a difficult job to fail, and a second time director Angelina Jolie does a descent job in keeping the pacing so well, that at the running time 2 h 14 min this movie almost never drags and is very good.Overall, 'Unbroken' is a superbly told magnificent true story. It has all the right ingredients for a good movie, and good movie it is. It's very inspiring and shows that you must never let go, no matter how bad things can look, there is always an answer to everything.",9,3,7,10 April 2015
The Matrix," Timeless Masterpiece
","Greetings from Lithuania.What can i say about this film, that hasn't been said before. Probably nothing new - just another review that worships 'The Matrix'.Yes, the film is perfect, perfect in any way you prefer. I just like almost all of us have watched 'The Matrix' for ~20 times, in 2-3 years after it's release and each time that was unforgettable tour de force. The timeless plot, characters, action. It created a new dimension in movie making. Almost 10 years have passed since i saw it last time, and last week i got the blue ray of it, and sat down for a re watch, on my new projector and sound system. 'The Matrix', to my little surprise, hasn't aged a bit. Really. The visuals still look the same as it was in the year 2000. Still. The same. After 15 years! After 'Avatar' and many more visuals feasts that i have witnessed, the look of this film in my eyes hasn't aged a bit - i won't lie - i was surprised. Maybe it's because the driving force behind this masterpiece was always a plot, the characters and action wasn't over forced - it always looked as a natural thing of events. So i won't go in to details, plot - you all know it very well. What i like to say, is that you should check this film again if you haven't see it for some time, it really looks stunning. Ye, i said 'if you haven't see it for some time' - i don't believe that there is a living human who likes to watch movies that hasn't see and admire this film before.",10,1,3,18 May 2014
Godzilla," Good movie, with some haunting visuals
","Greetings from Lithuania.Budget of this film was 100.000.000 dollars, not the biggest amount of money to create a huge blockbuster with monsters, so don't be surprised if 'Godzilla' doesn't look like Transformesr type film. It's better that those. You won't see main beast for long, and all battles were created at night or at the dawn, but it doesn't look cheap rater it looks haunting. There is also a nice story, but nothing special. Ken Watanabe's character was looking very surprised in all scenes, but there were no special performances. I'm glad i watched it on the big screen in 3D, because on home cinema i't won't be very impressive, but overall special effects and especially sound effects were really good, and sometimes very haunting. I'm recommending it to all who want's to see some nice monster movie, with some truly haunting images. If you saw the first film of this director, you'll know what i mean.",9,11,24,15 May 2014
Life," Not bad sci-fi flick for seeing it once and nothing else
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Life' (2017) is a movie which will probably appear to those who like sci-fi movies in a first place - more for fans i think. The premise of this movie isn't original to say the least, but i like these 'kind' of movies when they are done good. 'Life' could be best described as a guilty pleasure - it doesn't offer you absolutely anything new or very exciting. Yet the craftsmanship of this movie and the A list cast makes it for a pretty not bad movie overall.The weakest thing in this movie without a doubt was script. There many predictable moments, and some eye rolling lines like 'my place is in a space - i don't want return to 8 billions of the motherfxxxers' - seriously - this line should have been movies dramatic punchline yet it sounded kinda bizarre. This movie also borrows heavily from great movies like 'Alien' or 'Gravity' - 'Life' unfortunately is by all possible moons not as good as any of those movies. Overall, 'Life' is a not bad sci-fi flick for seeing it once at home. It doesn't provide anything new or very exciting, script is pretty weak, yet craftsmanship, music and great actors do deliver. And by the way to call it a creature in a movie with a name 'Celvin' does not work. 'Bob' should sounded more menacing.",7,1,3,17 June 2017
Heat," More than meets the eye.
","Greetings from Lithuania.What can i say about this film, that hasn't been said before. I saw this film for about 7 times, i think. I love this film for a many reasons. Because it's so wonderfully acted and directed (the script is wonderful too). Because it's so epic. Because it's so beautifully sad. This isn't just a 'cops and robbers' movie - NO. I don't know, maybe it's just my imagination, but in this movie i saw a fight not just between cops and robbers but a battle between good and evil. And it's a breathtaking experience, when in one, just one scene, two characters, who are representing good and evil (and two different worlds), just sit dawn and talk. And they are talking not about film's plot, but about they lives. You can feel how similar they really are. If one of them wouldn't be a cop, and the other a criminal, they would be the best friends (i heard and loved the 'theory' that Vincent and Neil are brothers, when Neil says to Eady that 'i have a brother somewhere...'). But enough about 'good and evil'. This is a breathtaking action 'heist' thriller. Yes, i think that scene that goes after bank robbery is the most realistic 'shoot-out' in a movie history (there are other wonderfully filmed 'shoot-outs', but this one i will remember for a lifetime). How this film wasn't nominated for a best cinematography, editing and sound effects is beyond my.For this films line A.Pacino will be remembered forever: 'because she had a great xxx !!!' :). What a great performances, from everyone. By the way, (for a movie buffs), last time i watched 'Heat', i noticed how big influence this film made for 'The Dark Knight'. The 'interogation' scene in 'The Dark Knight' is so similar to a 'conversation' scene (not just a cinematography). Two main characters talks not about films plot but about them self's, what they do, and how they are fitting in this world. Bank robbery scene i a very familiar to 'The Dark Knight'. And this goes for a real fans: don't know how much of You noticed, but at movies ('Heat') time 1:06:00 there is a shoot that goes for 6-8 seconds. This shot shows a car, with all the 'bad guys' when they are going through the city. This is 99% identical shot that was used in 'The Dark Knight', when Harvey Dent is being transported in a cop car through the city - view goes 'from the sky', there is no music, no city sounds, just a night and this excellent tune.Watch this 'Los Angeles crime saga' - this is a timeless art.",10,0,1,10 October 2010
What We Do in the Shadows," Absolutely hilarious
","Greetings from Lithuania.'What We Do in the Shadows' (2014) is without a doubt the best comedy of 2014. It's flat out hilarious from start till finish. Everything is movie works so well, that it's running time 1h 22 min becomes the fastest running movie in a very long time.This is a superbly made vampire comedy, shoot in mocumentary style. It's bloody, funny, hilarious and hellova entertaining. Acting is superb - everyone here is real, and because around them some outrageous things are happening - they are very funny, Script, direction and acting is by the same guys. From now on I will looking forward for their new creations.Overall, if you like really great horror comedies - this is probably one of the very best I have ever saw. It works as a superb spoof of vampire movies (with running gags of 'Twilight', 'Dracula', 'Nosferatu') as well as a standalone comedy. And werewolves are both superbly funny. Amazing flick.",10,0,3,7 May 2015
Deadpool," A truly fun flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.If you are tired of all Marvel Capt. America type of superhero flicks, 'Deadpool' (2016) offers probably the best antidote imaginable. The movie itself is one very fun ride, which (finally!) doesn't take itself to seriously, and mocks everything and everyone - and does this truly funny. It's is rated R but it is not gore fest, back in the 80's and 90's R rated movies were much, much bloodier.Overall, 'Deadpool' is a one highly enjoyable ride. At running time 1 h 40 min it runs smoothly and almost every scene has something more interesting to offer then your average one in a year Marvel movie flick. Thank god this one wasn't made by them, because we wouldn't have this bold and highly unpredictable (in the way it flows) picture. And while the true Marvel fans could be left disappointed that it doesn't play by their fan boys rules, everyone else will be highly entertained.",9,3,9,7 June 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' (2014) is superbly crafted action comedy with some spoof elements. Acting was solid, action scenes weer superb in it's silliness and craziness. The plot is good for this kind of picture, and special effects were really good. The first training scene with water was the best one - great sequence. Maybe the ending felt kinda simple and generic, but maybe that was the point.Overall, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is very entertaining picture. Don't take it to seriously and you will definitely enjoy this movie. It's not as a great as 'Kick-Ass' (first movie), but it's a very solid entertainment.",9,2,7,1 June 2015
Ran," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.To shortly sumarize 'Ran' (1985), a movie made by a legendary Akira Kurosawa - this is a great movie. It is superbly crafted, greatly acted and written and wonderfully directed. There are few battle scenes, but both are memorable in its own way - especially the haunting castle siege scene done without sound effects, accompanied only by haunting score - amazing sequence. I also highly enjoyed the story itself - its shows that one has to know how to give a power to the others, even if others are his family and how it can turn out if its done not in a right way - something to be learned even in these times.Overall, 'Ran' is a pure classic. Superbly made with themes that done age - this is sure must see for everyone who appreciate great cinema.",9,2,3,20 May 2018
Fast Five," Great ride!
","Greetings from Lithuania.This is the best action movie so far in 2011, hands down. Action sequences are UNBELIEVABLE in every meaning of this word. Plot? Nothing new here, but it works. Acting is OK, especially from Dwayne Johnson - he simply rocks in this one! What i liked the most in 'Fast Five' that action sequences doesn't use CGI, or uses it where it's only necessary. Stunts are 'crazy' in 'Fast Five' - in a god way. And that is what makes action seq. in 'Fast Five' look AMAZING - You have to see it on a big screen. Really looking forward to 'F&F6'!9/10.",10,1,2,26 June 2011
The Thin Red Line," A Masterpiece and one of the few best war movies ever
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Thin Red Line' (1998) for many years in my mind was in a constant fight for the best war movie title with 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Apocalypse Now'. For some time i considered 'The Thin Red Line' as the best war movie ever. At the moment i think that both previous titles are better war depictions then 'The Thin Red Line', but 'Line' is a sure number 3 war movie ever on my list and it will probably stay there until my time is done. 'The Thin Red Line' is a masterpiece. I say this very rarely, but it is true in this case. It is bold, unfocused (but highly controlled), poetic, brutal (but not overdone) take on the war. I saw this picture ~5 times, and every time i saw something new. Probably it depends on the age of the viewer, but this is not an easy movie to watch. It's narrative is not a typical, pacing can be excruciating, but when it starts, it is impossible to put it down, its like a great novel. Probably the best way to enjoy 'The Thin Red Line' is simply to relax and be taken by this movie.Never before i saw nature depicted like in 'The Thin Red Line'. With the opening shoot of a crocodile to a closing take on the beach with a flower, the great Terrence Malick shows us that nature is unbreakable, no matter what happens in between and between people, nature like this flower will always remain, even if people will catch the crocodile.Big and one of the most impressive cast ensemble off all time creates characters that are not sharply drawn, and sometimes it is not easy to identify with them. I think that was the point. It is easy to identify to my favorite character Pvt. Witt, because he is like an outsider in this situation. At the same time he is a great soldier (experiences and trustworthy in combat), but at the same time he is not a soldier - he does what he is forced to do. The opening scene with him deserted on the island with locals are amazing, they showcase what is essential - love, life, caring for each other - and when the ship comes, we understand that it carries everything opposite to that. I could write about almost every scene in this movie - landing on the beach; soldiers march through landscape with native who walks by without noticing soldiers; a terrific opening battle scene (music, cinematography, acting); tension before it; unforgettable attack on the village, with long unbroken shoot witch is filled with long lasting images; the conversations between Pvt. Witt and Sgt. Edward Welsh (Sean Penn); the great monologues from Nick Nolte's character; torn between duty and humanity Elias Koteas's captain Staros; scene where human dies, and a bird is being born...Overall, 'The Thin Red Line' is masterpiece, but not for everyone. There are a lot of people who dislike this picture, and it is not hard to understand why. The sometimes non linear narration, construction of this movie and pacing can be very hard for action orientated mainstream audience, especially if you compare it to more 'easier' approach of 'Saving Private Ryan' (which i think is a better war movie overall). The best way to admire 'The Thin Red Line' is just to be taken by it. This is one of the very best films ever created with war theme and overall.",10,6,10,26 August 2015
Green Book," A movie that will leave you smiling
","Greetings from Lithuania.Is hardly possible to give a lower rating then 10 for 'Green Book' (2018). I mean this movie has some amazing acting by two leads, superb directing of the movie, good production values and script that is a bit manipulative but so involving, that at the running time 2 h this movie never dragged for a second. Yet this is a predictable and more of 'movie' story then reality, this is a good feel movie first of all - like a Disney take on racism.Overall, 'Green Book' is a superbly involving and excellently paced movie. It will leave you smiling. Great movie all in all.",10,2,4,24 March 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Solid action film for those who liked the first part
","Greetings from Lithuania.While i don't think that 'John Wick: Chapter 2' (2017) is a better movie then a first part, here i'm talking about one of the better action films in recent years. I really enjoyed Chapter 2, it has everything a super action film should have - clear and descent plot, nice acting, superb directing and action scenes that does deliver. Sure 'John Wick' plays more like cartoon if you start to think about reality of the movie - this is a fairy tale, but its a damn good one. Action scenes were superb, as good as in a first one. This film expands the universe of this 'assassin' underworld and it does this well by not over exploring it. Also this movie was superbly paced - at running time hours i wasn't bored for a second and highly enjoyed this action flick.Overall, while 'John Wick: Chapter 2' doesn't achieve the greatness of 'The Raid 2: Berandal' to deliver action film that leaves you exhilarated by the end, this is non less a very solid action film for those who liked the first part and love good old 'shoot em up' movies in general. This one is very solid.",9,0,1,25 June 2017
Annihilation," Great science fiction movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.Boy oh boy how i missed movies like 'Annihilation' (2018) in the past time. The movie which is interesting, involving, superbly made and makes you guessing the things and the same time wonder. 'Annihilation' (2018) is a great movie for those who like intelligent, not rushed and greatly made sci-fi movies which does not tell you everything in the end clearly - unlike many resent flicks this one does work on every level. It has superb performance by Natalie Portman (her best since her Oscar winning role), amazing directing and writing Alex Garland, haunting score, amazing cinematography. Overall, 'Annihilation' is a great movie which plays more like an antidote to latest so called sci-fi cinema. Great movie in all directions.",10,3,5,31 May 2018
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Very good but sometimes inconsistent
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' (1975) is a truly funny movie, which is also surprisingly involving. Graham Chapman as King Arthur gives the best performance in this movie, others were good. Settings were superb, i wonder how in all that mud they managed to make a comedy. And the movie itself is funny, if you like this humor. Basically it is absurd, and i'm not sure i get the very ending, but maybe there wasn't what to get in a first place. Overall, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' jokes are sometimes (most of the time actually) very funny or funny, but there are some inconsistency as well, and that isn't a good thing. I truly liked this movie overall, it was very involving due to good and funny script as well directing and acting. All in all this a good movie, sometimes even a great movie.",8,0,2,20 July 2016
Aladdin," Good animated movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Aladdin' (1992) is a pure Disney classic. It has great pacing, superbly cute music and heroes to root for. Its extremely well animated, and voice acting was excellent.Overall, because many of people have probably saw this classic already - if you haven't yet, do yourself a favor and watch it, its really good.",8,1,2,27 October 2019
Spectre," Superb Bond movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Spectre' (2015) is highly entertaining Bond movie. It a superb follow up to the 'Skyfall' and it is a great entry into rebooted Bond franchise. Finally we do get to see the famous evil organization behind last 3 pictures, and it does not disappoint. Unfortunately there is one weak side. I thought that Christoph Waltz's character was not fully realized as a ultimate James Bond enemy. He is a great actor, but he wasn't fully and superbly used in here and this is the weakest and the only downside of 'Spectre' in my opinion. Everything else here is superbly solid and highly entertaining. Directing by great S.Mendes was great, very solid and highly controlled. Pacing of this picture was great, at running time 2 h 15 min it never drags and is very involving. Opening was great, with seemingly one unbroken shoot in Mexico - superbly cool costumes as well. Action set pieces are the ones you could expect in this movie, they are great and looks as realistic as possible in this kind of movie.Overall, i enjoyed 'Spectre' more than i thought i will be. After magnificent 'Skyfall' i didn't believe that it would be possible to top it in the near future, and 'Spectre' doesn't top 'Skyfall'. Nevertheless this is a great Bond movie that everyone can enjoy it.",9,19,44,6 November 2015
Braveheart," A True Anthem for Freedom...
","Greetings from Lithuania.Excellent! This is the movie that beats them all! The words can not describe the greatness of this movie. I've cried when i first time saw it. I've seen it about 30 times and it only gets better and better. I have voted for about 1300 movies at IMDb and this is my favorite motion picture of all time. Mel Gibson did a wonderful job with this movie. Direction, performances, music, screenplay, makeup, cinematography - everything in this movie is just incredible and exceptional. I always wanted to see this movie in a cinema, if only i could have a chance...",10,9,17,13 March 2008
The Nice Guys," Entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Nice Guys' (2016) is sometimes hilariously funny, sometimes to much focused on unnecessary things, but always entertaining. Script by Shane Black was good, not original, but good for what it is. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry together and interaction between these two really work. Action scenes were good and almost always darkly funny - very funny actually. Now there are some unfocused plot elements that prevented me to giving this truly entertaining movie higher score, nevertheless if you like 'Lethal Weapon' series, you should definitely watch 'The Nice Guys'.Overall, 'The Nice Guys' is good, fun entertainment. Seeing Kim Basinger and Russell Crowe together again on screen (even for a short time) since classical 'L.A. Confidential' was very pleasant - they have some great chemistry together on screen which is simply hard to explain. Still, not everything worked in 'The Nice Guys' superbly well, nevertheless this is a fun entertainment with far more positive then negative.",8,2,5,15 August 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Incredible
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Mad Max: Fury Road' (2015) is like no other mainstream action movie out there. Saw it last night, in 3D - it's a helluva entertainment. The crazy high metacritic score and praises from critics weren't just an empty thing - this movie is truly great. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' takes place somewhere in between 2 and 3 movie of the franchise, but if you haven't seen previous movies don't worry, this movie stands on it's own, but it's better for you to watch previous parts, especially 'Road Warrior'. To get straight to the point, 'Fury Road' is a blast from start till finish. It's hands down the best action movie i saw in quite long time. It has insane stunts, terrificly directed and choreographed action scenes, crazy, twisted and 'take you right there' settings, solid acting, tight and very simple script, amazing / gorgeous cinematography and very good music. All these parts are combined together in not very traditional and at the same time masterfully good way. This movie feels unique. It has lots of explosions, but strangely enough, we do care and kinda feel every single of it, even if characters or bad guys were on screen for just a second. There are some truly visionary scenes in this picture, which you won't see in a big budget mainstream movies, like the one at night in burned land. The ending is terrific, with a last scene just begging for this movie to be seen again - terrific ending which sort off reminded me of 'The Dark Knigh Rises'.Overall, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is incredible picture. It has the crazy spirit of previous movies, and if you like this kinda stuff, you will be in nirvana watching 'Fury Road'",10,17,33,15 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," One More...
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Hacksaw Ridge' (2016) is one of the very best films i saw in 2016. This is a raw, brutal, violent and very moving one singular motion picture experience. It has to be the best WW2 movie since 'Saving Private Ryan' - it is that good.Andrew Garfield was absolutely stunning Desmond Doss, a true hero who saved many lives in one of the bloodiest conflicts during the Battle of Okinawa. Brilliant as usual Mel Gibson pulled no punches during battle sequences, they are as brutal as I've never saw since, well 'Saving Private Ryan' again. This is a one bloody, gory, visceral experience. Yet it isn't only about blood and guts. It is about heroes who did incredible things during unimaginable events.Overall, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a pure movie experience. Superbly crafted, amazingly acted by literally everyone involved with great music and stunning director doing his great work, this one of 2016's best so far.",10,7,13,13 November 2016
Warcraft," Not bad
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Warcraft' (2016) is a one OK / nice movie to see it in a movie theater for those who didn't play the games and couldn't spell one of many bizarre names of characters in this movie (i'm one of those). Special effects were good, nothing groundbreaking, but good. The weakest part of this movie for me was Travis Fimmel acting. That has to be one of the most uninspiring performances (which should have been inspiring) in big budget movies ever - he just went trough all movie with one face expression - even when something very dramatic happened - he was just staring at the screen, with no emotions visible. They need to re- cast the main actor in a sequels, if there will be any. And sorry Paula Patton, almost every time you went on screen with that ultra-bizarre looking haircut and make-up, i started to smile. The story was quite OK - like i said i only played one of the very first games, so all the characters for me were unknown, and many of them remained unknown after the movie. As not a fan i can say, this movie won't be as much impressive to see it at home, so if you want to spend 2 hours and see some OK flick on Friday evening, 'Warcraft' is for you, but don't expect to be blown away. Overall, 'Warcraft' is nicely paced movie, which at running time 2 hours made me to watch at my watch only once - and it was in a scene were some mags were fighting. Performances were between low and OK - better cast highly recommended for sequels (altough there was one very short cameo - i won't spoil anything, but this great actor / actress should have been more on screen - it's the biggest star of this movie for sure). 'Warcraft' is a one nice flick to see it once on a big screen, and for home media - extended version is recommended (if there will be one), because the strange thing but this movie wasn't predictable overall, and there even were some glimpses for a great, epic movie, but on it's running time 2 hours the story didn't had enough room i guess. So - it's a OK flick for those who haven't play the games, and it wasn't as bad as critics said.",7,1,1,10 June 2016
Gladiator," Great entertainment
","Greetings from Lithuania.As i guess there isn't a life form here on earth who somehow by now have missed this movie - i won't going to go into details and be as short here as possible.'Gladiator' (2000) is a great and superb entertainment in every possible way. From the excellent performances by literally everyone involved, from unforgettable and music so superb directing, set design, sound design, costumes - this is a highly entertaining and involving movie from the opening till tear-jerking closing scene. Sure there tons of historical inaccuracies (bizarre to say the least), but 'Gladiator' shouldn't be seen as historical movie - this is a revenge story set in ancient Rome, and the story and its presentation is universal. Overall, 'Gladiator' is one of those movies which wherever you catch on TV you stay with it until the end. Superbly made, terrifically entertaining movie from star till finish, this is a must see.",10,0,0,14 May 2017
Born on the Fourth of July," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.In my opinion, 'Born on the Fourth of July' (1989) was a definitive best movie of that year who should have won it, and not 'Driving Miss Daisy', which was a pretty good movie, but did not age very well. 'Born on the Fourth of July' on the other hand is a great movie, that left me dazzled and confused when i first time saw it when i was 16 years old, and yesterday for a second time, when i'm 34. This is in my opinion is one of 2 best O. Stone's movies he even made, along with 'Platoon'. That one depicted Vietnam war for perspective of soldiers in war. This is one shows what happened to those who returned injured. The third movie in this unofficial trilogy showed the other side of participants of this war.Acting by Tom Cruse was amazing - he should have won that year as well - this is still by far his one of the very best performances, and i like this actor in almost anything he is still doing. Directing was superb, no wonder it won Oscar. Script and story were sometimes difficult to watch because of the grim reality it showed.Overall, 'Born on the Fourth of July' is a great movie. If you still have not seen it by any chance, do yourself a favor and watch it. Its not an easy movie to endure, but a very rewarding one.",10,0,1,25 January 2020
Born on the Fourth of July," Great movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Born on the Fourth of July' (1989) is easily one of the few very best movies from inconsistent yet always interesting Oliver Stone. It sharply tells a story of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise in one of his best performances (still!), a true young All-American patriot who came to fought to Vietnam driven by patriotic feelings and responsibility for his county, only to be forgotten by the same country later - and eventually his way to some sort of redemption (if you can call it like that).'Born on the Fourth of July' is probably not as good as Oliver Stone's best movie 'Platoon' but it's easily stands second in my opinion. It has all the great movie should have - superb, involving and very true script, great directing (at 2 h 20 min this movie never drags for a second), superb acting by all involved - and like i said, it is a very true story. 10/10 - great movie.",10,0,1,15 June 2016
Macbeth," One of the most uninvolving movies i have ever seen
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Macbeth' (2015) is a shockingly uninvolving movie. Given the A list cast, some nice movie craftsmanship here and there and some nice settings, this movie is beyond boring. If there weren't short synopsis in the beginning, i probably wouldn't understand what was going on at all. The story here, based on well known material (but honestly not for me, i haven't read it nor heard about it much), is not the worst thing in 'Macbeth' - it is the screenplay (which i don't know if is accurate to the material) which lacks anything that would resemble to interesting movie. Dialogs (or more like monologues) were highly uninvolving, and this movie at running time 1 h 45 min. is very, very, very (and did i say VERY) slow moving - it drags like hell. I somehow managed to sit though this mess in like 4 or 5 days, watching it like max 15-20 min. a day and hoping to see something that resembles a movie, but unfortunately it wasn't here.Overall, 'Macbeth' was a shocking experience for me. This movie should be used as a torture devise for those who don't read reviews which says 'STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF!'. You have been warned.",2,3,6,14 April 2016
Goodfellas," One Of The Best Movies Ever Made
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Goodfellas' (1990) is simply put, one of the very best movies ever made. Martin Scorsese's direction is beyond believe, but still i think that Kevin Costner was equally worth winning Oscar for best director for his masterpiece 'Dances with Wolves' (1990). That said, i won't say anything new in praise for 'Goodfellas' that wasn't said thousands times before. It is one of the most involving movies ever made. When it starts, it sucks you in in a second and doesn't let go till the last shoot. There isn't a bad performance in this movie. I could go on and write pages about how great this movie is.Overall, see 'Goodfellas' once again, as this movie is ageless. Simply put, along side with 'Godfather', this is the best mob movie ever made. True masterpiece.",10,0,1,7 August 2016
The Bourne Supremacy," Great Bourne Movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Bourne Supremacy' (2004) was and still is a superb 'Bourne' movie. Directed by the great Paul Greengrass is gave a roots to 'hand held' action set pieces as well as this style overall. The first movie didn't had this that much. Story was involving and fast moving. Action scenes, especially a great chase sequence at the in Moskow still puts all 'Fast & Furious' movies in to shame - amazing stunts, cinematography and editing puts right there in the actions and it always look plausible. Acting was very solid as well as overall movie craftsmanship.Overall, 'The Bourne Supremacy' is a superb Bourne installment and movie overall. Superbly crafted, involving and plausible it still rocks.",9,1,1,23 April 2017
13 Hours," Very solid action movie based on a very true story
","Greetings from Lithuania.It is a bit weird to call '13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi' (2016) action movie when so much in here is based on a very true story - it's not just shoot-em-up - it all, more or less, happened in real life. That said, Michael Bay delivers with '13 Hours' a very solid action thriller. Acting was very solid by all involved, especially by John Krasinski, James Badge Dale and David Denman. Cinematography as well as script were very solid and engaging. Sure, this movie isn't as deep as 'The Hurt Locker' or 'Zero Dark Thirthy', but it is a very solid film nevertheless - i even kinda enjoyed it a bit more then a very good 'Lone Survivor'.Overall, Michael Bay delivers a very solid action based on a very true story movie. It is by many moons better then any Transformers' movie (except the first one), and almost on the same league as 'The Rock' - but as last one was pure entertainment, '13 Hours' delivers more because it was sadly all true.",9,3,10,9 June 2016
Sully," Great film about a true hero
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Sully' (2016) is simply a great movie anyway you look at it. It is superb recreation of the fated flight itself and what happened afterwards. I was highly involved into this story even knowing the outcome and heard a little bit before this movie of what happened next. Acting was amazing by Tom Hanks. After seeing the true Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger on some interviews i couldn't take my eyes from Mr. Hanks - he IS Sully in here. Others were also very good, and you can't expect anything else actually from a movie by Clint Eastwood. It is superbly crafted motion picture about event that probably everyone of us saw it on TV during its time.Overall, 'Sully' is perfectly paced, superbly crafted motion picture. It shows an absolutely true story and delivers you to the plain itself during the event. Great movie.",10,2,4,5 December 2016
Princess Mononoke," Amazing
","Greetings from Lithuania. 'Mononoke-hime' (1997) aka. 'Princess Mononoke' is amazing animated film. Yes, i call it a film, because the story, the characters are so good, that barely can find in movies, not to mention animation. From the opening image till the last frame, it's captivating, imaginative, and simply amazing. The music is superb. The visual style of this movie is amazing, you can even image how much work got in to this one. The script is also fabulous, it very engaging. If you still haven't see this create animated film, do your self a favor an see it on the biggest possible screen - it's truly a great art.",10,2,3,25 August 2014
Alien: Covenant," Great entry into Alien universe
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Alien: Covenant' (2017) is a superb installment into Alien universe. I loved 'Prometheus' back in 2012, and the latest movie serves as a sequel to 'Prometheus', prequel to 'Alien' and a superb standalone movie - if you love sci-fi and alien movies - 'Covenant' is a blast from start till finish.I highly enjoyed pretty much everything about this film. Settings were terrific, acting was uniformly good by everyone with the standout performances by the always great Michael Fassbender and Danny McBride. All the sci-fi stuff was great - really love this universe - it is probably the only movie franchise which i honestly do care about and really try to connect the dots when watching these movies. And while 'Covenant' doesn't go very deep into ideas this time around, it has some good ones. This time is more about xenomorph - and i loved it as well. There isn't really much action in this movie, but there are few amazingly staged action sequences after which i was like 'that was awesome!'.Overall, 'Alien: Covenant' is a superbly crafted movie for those who loved alien movies and this universe. It is amazingly looking movie and at the running time 2 hours i was involved into it from start till finish. Bring me the sequels!",10,90,179,13 May 2017
Draft Day," Predictable, yet very entertaining flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Draft Day' (2014) is a very enjoyable flick. You don't really have to be NFL fan to enjoy this film, this is a well acted, directed and written movie. It's kinda predictable of course, i kinda felt the outcome, but nevertheless, this movie is very entertaining from start till finish. No Oscars will shine in here, but it's a very fine picture for a boring evening. Overall, 9/10 for 'Draft Day' - very good acting (especialy by Kevin Costner), solid script, good directing - even if it's predictable, you will definitely enjoy the ride.",9,0,1,28 September 2014
The Martian," Funny, involving and entertaining
","Greetings from Lithuania.'The Martian' (2015) is not 'Interstellar' type or level sci-fi movie, but it is superb picture. It's funny, superbly paced, greatly acted story. Special effects were very good, and they are used here to support the story, which is very simple, but very intriguing. The only complain i had for this movie is kinda bad module work, when they show a moving vehicle on Mars, sometimes it looks too fake, maybe because it was in 3D. Matt Damon carrier this film in a superb performance -it's not Oscar worthy, but a very solid job, he delivers. I also liked Jeff Daniels acting, great work. Others were very solid. Pacing of this movie is superb, at running time 2 h 10 min. it runs very smoothly and doesn't drag for a second. Music was ... lets just say funny in a context.Overall, 'The Martian' takes itself seriously, but doesn't forget humor, which there is a lot in this movie. This is probably the warmest movie about Mars of all time, there are no villains, no aliens, just a man's will to survive at any cost. 'The Martian' is great entertainment.",10,3,60,2 October 2015
From Here to Eternity," Good movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.'From Here to Eternity' (1953) isn't a real classic, but it is a very solid movie, even when seeing it for a first time just yet in 2016. Performances were very good by all involved, directing and script were solid as well. Film is solidly paced, at running time 1 h 58 min it does not drag. Watching this movie now i realized that it influenced some movies which i have seen. Overall, 'From Here to Eternity' is a good movie, which aged quite good, and while attack on Perl Harbor scenes at the end won't blow you away now, it is not about that day actually. It is about a story that was before that day, and it's good story done right.",8,3,5,22 May 2016
Furious 7," Not the most furious of fast, but still an entertaining flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.'Furious 7' (2015) is not the best in the series, although entertaining flick. If you like this series, you will definitely like 'Furious 7'. It's has over the top action scenes, nice but nothing fresh plot, cool actions scenes - everything you can expect from the series.There are problems with this movie nevertheless. With each installment, the action scenes becomes more and more unrealistic. You have to turn your disbelief meter off to enjoy this flick even as an action popcorn flick. The outcome of each action scene is sooo over the top, so unrealistic that i simply tough 'Oh come on'! after each of them. I know this is an action flick and i know that this is a popcorn flick, but ... really? From many many near dead scenes our heroes witnesses, one with a driving off a mountain when surrounded by a bad guys in this movie stands from a crowd. I mean - really??? You can simply do THAT and WALK from a car with NO bruises??? As usual, there are hand to hand combat scenes and as usual - no one bleeds! Because this is a PG-13 movie.The villain was not bad at all here - Jason Statham, probably the most menacing villain this series have had yet. The opening scene with him was cool, although rushed with bad music and to quick cuts. But i didn't like the outcome of his.Overall, if you like this stuff, you will like 'Furious 7'. It's slightly better then the 6th part, but no match to a 'Fast 5', which is still i think ranks as the best in the series. There is also a nice last farewell scene to a late Paul Walker - really nicely done here and has more meaning to a real life than a movie.",8,0,5,2 April 2015
The Godfather," The Mona Liza of Motion Pictures art
","Greetings from Lithuania.To call 'The Godfather' a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.",10,6,9,7 May 2015
