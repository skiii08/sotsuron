United 93," Some Aspects of a believable Truth
","If you are tired, and you still decide to watch a film, chances are big you will fall asleep sooner or later, regardless of the films quality. Your mind may be ready and willing, but the tiredness of your body is stronger. Yet, from time to time there are very few occasions were the film actually sets you awake. This is the effect United 93 will have. You won't get more tension, you won't get more drama, and still it is a decent film lacking exploitation or exaggeration. Of course, one might be tempted to say, what is depicted here is closer to reality because reality itself is portrayed. Then again, the exact details of what took place on that fateful flight will always remain a riddle. Many pieces have been found, but they can't make up a complete solution. Well aware of this, director Paul Greengrass, on his audio commentary, calls his film an attempt to present a 'believable truth'. - The 9/11 commission found out that the passengers on flight 93 were only seconds away from overwhelming the hijackers. Lines on paper can transfer that into readers minds; but it's images like here that create a lasting impact. So what you see may not be reality, but it's a believable account of how it might have been, and of many aspects in regard to how they must have been. Once seen, you'll never forget it. A film as terrific as it is memorable.",9,0,1,6 April 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," The good Guys and the bad Weather
","Well, it's entertaining. And that is all there is. If you wish to see Dennis Quaid raise to heroic fame as the genius-turns-adventurer to rescue his likewise heroic son in a very snowy New York City, you should pay the bucks for this one. The storyline even manages to give some insight into environmental problems, but of course the pathetic parts stand in front. A typical Emmerich  not too bad, but not too good either. If only those scripts got rid of their clichés It's not even a spoiler to speak of them, since anyone whose ever seen catastrophes in their Hollywood appearance can tell: Quaid loses friend, but never faith; his son delivers material for a Love Theme to be added to Harald Klosers score; his mother sticks to the sick child, come what may. Special effects are fine though. It is a film that was okay for me to watch, but one screening is enough of the rest of my life.",5,0,1,29 May 2004
U-571," Unsinkable
","What I like best about films is when they manage to be entertaining while at the same thing avoiding to repeat the common clichés of their genres. 'U-571' is quite a good example of how that can be achieved. If you like submarine movies like 'Crimson Tide' but wish that had some more war-like-realistic action packaged into all the thrill, then this one may serve your wishes. McConaughey, though usually not the best of actors (but quite good in 'Frailty'), has one of his more memorable roles. Bill Paxtons part is shorter, but it's always a joy to see him act (not to mention if his acts and directs, as was also the case in 'Frailty'). Harvey Keitel has had much worse parts than this one. The German Thomas Kretschmann is fine too, and Jon Bon Jovi looks twenty years younger than he actually is. Direction and script, given it is typical Hollywood warhorse, are good as well, and Richard Marvins music score offers a congenial essay in orchestral tour-de-force. If you don't mind that the historic reality looked a bit different (but who minds that when watching fiction?), then 'U-571' is one of the better entries into the genre.",7,1,5,12 June 2004
