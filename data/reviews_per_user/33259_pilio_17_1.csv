Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stop the Bashing
","This movie and the whole prequel of Star Wars is being bashed and criticized without stop for very bad reasons. I understand that the older people who grew up with the sequel will always love the last three episodes better and I have no problem with that. What I don't understand is why people spend countless hours on saying how bad this movie and the prequel are, something that isn't true at all. I saw all six movies in order and I can say that all of them are very good and nothing less than 8/10.What you need to do to appreciate this movie is to let yourself go into the world of Star Wars and try to understand what's happening at the precise moment of this episode. Don't try to make links with the sequels because you're not supposed to know what's going to happen in the following movies yet. I think a lot of the sequel fans will watch this movie and say it's horrible because it doesn't fit what they thought Star Wars was all about. Well, from a neutral point of view, I can say that all 6 movies were all pretty much the same thing (good story, good acting, creativity) and this movie isn't any exception. I think this movie has a good story behind it and all you need to do is try to appreciate it from a neutral point of view. This movie particularly is very good because it establishes the foundations for all Star Wars movies to come. I personally found it very enjoyable and not at all worthy of all the bad ratings it's receiving. I think another reason that this movie isn't well rated is because it didn't meet the ''expectations'' of people, something you need to very careful with when watching a movie. Basically, watch this movie from a distant point of view (if you are used to the original trilogy especially) and you will realize that it's a great movie for the exact same reasons the sequel are great movies: It makes you enter into a wonderful imaginary world. Someone who hasn't seen or heard of the original Star Wars before in his life will get the same effect from watching this film than people got when they saw the first movie in 1977, and for that I have no doubt.",9,12,20,4 February 2011
