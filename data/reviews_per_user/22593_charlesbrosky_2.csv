Scarface," just incredible
","This is by far the best movie I have ever watched in my life. Al Pacino has gotta be the best actor. The way he plays Tony, you would never think he was anything BUT a Cuban refugee. I can watch this movie every day and not get bored of it. Most other movies always have something in it that could be different, or mistakes in it that you wonder how it could have gotten past the directors and editors, or something that just doesn't make sense. But this movie, in my opinion, has absolutely no loose ends! The single thing I didn't like about it was Manny's accent. It sounded too fake, and it just annoyed me every time I would hear it. Although I was upset Tony killed him because of the obvious reasons, I was a tad relieved that I didn't have to hear that accent anymore. I didn't understand Tonys mom. Why would she turn her only son away. No matter what he has done, you don't turn away a child. ESPECIALLY when he is throwing that kinda cash at you!! Hell, I would love for my kid to give that to me, regardless of how they got it. To sum it up, this was an absolute masterpiece. No other movie could be better than this, and they just don't make movies like this anymore.",10,9,18,5 June 2005
Cinderella Man," excellent
","This was definitely one of the year's best!!! I loved Rocky, and this gave me so much of that heart-pounding adrenaline that Rocky's fights gave me. Although Jim was no Rocky, Mae was no Adrian, and Joe was certainly no Mickey, they did one helluva job!!! This is definitely a must see! The fights were great, the crowds were always loud, whether cheering or booing. There were some really great shots, like when he came on for one of the fights, and it gives you a shot of what he's seeing when he ducks under the ropes. You see everyone sideways, because he's ducking etc... Renee did a wonderful job. She's a truly gifted actress, and although there wasn't that much actual acting in this one, she still did what she was supposed to do, and she did it wonderfully. Loved Russell's accent!!",10,2,3,8 June 2005
