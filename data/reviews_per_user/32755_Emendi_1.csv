Blade Runner 2049," Exquisitely paralleled
","Blade Runner has always been in my best three films. Having now seen BR2049, the original is enhanced. 2049 breathes in the essence of the original and whispers out its gems throughout. The heart-bursting penultimate scene on the steps synthesises the 2 films majestically. A tour DE force.",10,0,8,21 October 2017
