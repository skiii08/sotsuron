Gremlins," A classic but not original...
","'Gremlins' is a monster film which we can always remember and love. But is it really good? Well, here's the thing. This movie has a great idea of finally using gremlins as the monster. They also use them so well that the gremlins are the most likable character (except the leader who's a total pain in the neck). It's also a film which kids and adults can watch with no problem because it's a children's Christmas film and at the same time it's also monster horror movie. Like 'Home Alone', this movie becomes one of those films that becomes a must see on'Christmas' too. It's one hell of a film.The problem of the movie is that it has no originality. It's all about people not believing that there was a monster and they get the monster destroying the whole town. Wait! Where have I seen that idea before? Hmmm... Oh wait a minute! 'Frankenstien'! And there are a whole lot more movies like these too. And it doesn't really help the movie to survive in the movie world. Still, it's really entertaining and it has all the cool clich√©s. So it's definitely a must see for movie buffs or Christmas lovers!!!!",8,1,4,17 February 2011
Inception," Why?
","Sci-fi films are loved all around the world these days. 'The Matrix', 'Donnie Darko' and my personal favorite 'Brazil'. But here comes another film by director Christopher Nolan who finished 'The Dark Knight' 2 years ago and now is ready to do another movie. The critics and the audiences loved it. While I consider it as the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. And here's why.Now I must say that I don't think this is horrible. There are quite a lot of good things in this movie. First of all, the special effects are amazing. There's this scene where the other side of the street starts to bend and it meets the other side of the street. Cars are driving upside down and all those crazy things are happening. It was awesome. Second, the music is ground-breaking. There's always this big boom that comes out in the movie and it just makes your heart rattle. Third, the premise is brilliant. The idea of going into a dream and stealing somebody's thought is a premise that only Christopher Nolan can write. It is amazing at those points and I could've liked it.But there is one big problem I had with this movie. And that was the acting. The acting was horribely bland. It has no taste and I just think that the acting starts to get boring. Leonardo Dicaprio's acting has hardened as time went by. He was amazing in one of his first movies 'What's Eating gilbert grape' which is one of my favorite movies of all times. And of course I had a problem with Ellen Page who I thought was so good at acting after I watched 'Juno'. But no, she is so boring in this movie too. The characters doesn't help much. There is not a bit of character development is this movie. And I want good characters when I watch a movie.On the whole, I don't think this movie is terrible. It has its bad and good. I think he should go back to this days of 'The Dark Knight'. I know a lot of people loves this movie but for me, it's the worst Christopher Nolan film ever. But it's worth a watch if you know what a good movie is. I give it 6/10!",9,7,11,28 February 2011
