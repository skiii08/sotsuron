10 Cloverfield Lane," Good, but one thing rubbed me wrong - one BIG thing
","As far as movies go, whatever. Watchable. But I cannot stand this of-late propaganda that Russia is the bad guy. No, the movie does not wholly revolve around this, but Hollywood, under the current line of D.C. and media lies and propaganda simply tows the line of hatred and racism against any people it deems unfit. Russia is not a threat to anyone. NATO and 'murica are! If anything, it is Russians that need to worry about the current US administration's outright, blatant, disgusting lies and twisted, psychotic, extremist and determined nonsense and absurdity to turn the people of the US against any country insisting to retain its sovereignty and not be told what to do and how to live.I went into this review saying to myself 'Don't make it political, don't make it political,' but when I see Hollywood churning out parallel lies to those of the media and those of the current Washington and banking scumbags, it becomes a matter of simple right and wrong and I cannot help myself. People, STOP. Read, research, read some more (preferably history printed and published many years ago), and just plain use your common sense. Movies like this, along with all of the other nonsensical and conjured propaganda out there, just as with Germans in the 1930s, turn normal people into brainless cattle. The references to Russia in this movie as being a 'threat' are not only unfounded and unjustified, but are obnoxious and relentlessly sinister.To compare Russia as a threat to the US is to compare a person trapped inside their own house while surrounded by armed robbers outside of it, calling the trapped person a 'threat' because they went to the den and got their rifle out... and started cleaning and dusting it off just in case.My review of this movie, while admittedly only touching on one particular point in it, nevertheless is a valid one for those who watch things on television and in the cinema and know nothing of the underlying intent/s within them. The Overton Window is in 5th gear with the pedal to the floor in this film. Just be advised to spot the loony, political BS in it. If Hollywood insists on making every last possible thing on the screen involve wretched, intellectually condescending, and factually skewed politics in them, then it should also not be so terrible to note those things and review these films with the same political intervention they so desperately deserve. I get disgusted whenever the 'Russian aggression' brainwashing train comes thundering in at 100 MPH with no brakes and a blaring horn. If you believe a word of it, including all the lies about Ukraine, Crimea, etc., then forgive me for saying so, but you are a fool. Don't be a fool. Educate yourself beyond what the MSM and Hollywood sell to you. With each little drop of carefully worded lies such as the ones offered in this film, if even one out of ten people buy it, that is enough to make a world of difference -- a difference in the wrong and completely incorrect direction of truth and facts that will shape the minds of easily impressionable people, who in turn will then unconsciously end up repeating the same nonsense thereafter as if they know something. Sorry, but that makes me feel ill. Otherwise, the movie was so-so. I could have given this a 1* rating, but I decided not to let the politics get in the way of the actual story except for this much needed review and point within its context - a putrid, lying, irrational subtext. The writers, producers and director should be ashamed of themselves for that specific reason.",4,5,15,5 May 2016
The Hateful Eight," Liberalism is a mental disorder
","I will give nothing away, but racism works both ways.Thank goodness I did not have to pay to see this. If this gives anything away, then let it be this:Imagine a movie that is all about 'bad whitey, bad whitey, talk, kill, blood, kill, talk, kill again'. There, now you saw it. Quentin is a flake, period. Pulp Fiction was great. Another one or two of his flicks, decent. I do not however get the whole Tarantino craze, especially seeing as how it's basically the same movie every time. Violence? Okay then. 70's meet today? Yeah, got it. Actors in constant dialogue about nothing as they explain every nuance just in case you're too bored to think? Check. Although dialogue in film is great and too few films actually take the time, this is no Heat with DeNiro and Pacino. Like all Tarantino mush, this is just a 3:00 P.M. grade school brown bag of yesterday's pocket-stuffed tator tots and an argument of who gets the monkey bars next. With today's dumbed down average film-goer however, PC society being what it is, the dumber the better I suppose. Guess I'll just stick to reading. More justification to never pay to watch movies. The fact that this putrid piece of junk has an 8.0 rating is by and large a telltale of paid 'reviewers' and a whole bunch of folks in serious need of either professional treatment or a strong case to put into law a mandate that would force some members of society to have to start over from 1st grade, even if they're in their 30's. Tarantino is just a psycho with an audience of like minded fool-- er... sorry, fans, the careful study of who by a methodical actor could lend credence to a successful 2016 remake of Cuckoo's Nest. Oscars all-around! The natives shall dance around a fire and sing praise to the gods of atheism, in who they do not believe, to bring them rain and crops and call them president/s. Welcome to the 21st version of the 7th century. Folks, whatever your poison, the world's gone nuts and film is dead. If you enjoyed this movie then quit your job and move back in with your parents. Whoops. Looks like I'm too late. How late? If you liked this movie then I have non-brand items I'd like to introduce to you. Try snuggling up with the Snuggie. GLH for thinning hair. Mr. Microphone to liven up parties. Wait, but that's not all! Be your own boss and come to my seminar so you too can change your life. Just $395 and after one hour you'll never again have to hear, 'You're late again.' I digress. In summary, if you're over 30 and plan on being a Clinton voter, believe that Russia is evil, and like your eggs made of barley or greens hold the eggs, this film is for you!",1,43,90,22 January 2016
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Stupid making fun of stupid
","I'll keep it short. Every liberal ideal permeates through the attempt to make fun of it. In other words, retards making fun of retards. Stop the planet. You missed my stop. Better yet, if 'the big one' is supposed to eventually hit western California, I think it is long overdue for a 10 on the scale. If Hollywood and all of its pests and vermin sink with it, I will only cheer. Too bad there isn't a fault line running through Washington and through every other liberofascist center on this planet. I would cheer if they all jerked simultaneously. World's gone crazy.Yuck!",1,8,29,5 July 2016
