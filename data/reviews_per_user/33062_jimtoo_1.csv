The Blair Witch Project," overhyped and underdeveloped
","EYES WIDE SHUT was until this weekend the most over-hyped movie of this less than memorable summer movie season.  THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT now wears that crown.It is tedious, predictable, poorly shot (and yes I do realize the camera work enhances the sense of reality but does it have to be sooooo bad?) and most unfortunately it is a bore.  The only time my pulse rate went up was during the previews.  Wake up folks THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES. Because inexplicably most all critics like this fiasco doesn't mean you have to pretend you do.  Since I was a kid this genre has fascinated me but THE B W P is not its salvation.",Null,0,1,1 August 1999
