The King's Speech," A great emotional drama , based on a true story
","My Kings speech Review: This was simply Great. An amazing performance by Colin Firth simply truly amazing , and a great performance by Helena Bonham Carter as well. This movie was well directed as well , a great script based on a true story. I cannot seem to see any flaws in this movie , but be as it may it is not perfect. For some people may be a little bit 'boring'. But still a great movie that will touch you in many levels , a must see to watch with anyone who likes this kind of movie. If you like auto biographies and you like History this is just the most proper movie for you to watch , and now i will mention the thing i most liked in the movie : Geofrey Rush. I am a fan of Geofrey Ruch since pirate of the caribbien but this movie is a landmark of his career!",Null,0,0,20 April 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Great adaptation
","First of all, i would like to say as a Spider man fan my expectations were fulfilled, not only because the actors were so well chosen, but also because the universe that Marc Webb created for this movie was well adapted from some universes of Spider-man comics. And from other reviews i read from some 'displeased' fans, i would like to state that those people were ignorant and knew nothing about arcs that happened in the Spider man comic books. First of all the main plot was based on the ultimate series, but the 'vibe' it self was more based on the classic series, like for an example, Gwen Stacy was Peter's first love interest instead of Mary Jane. To finalize i just would like to complement both the performance by Rhys Ifans but also the loyalty of the Lizard character to the comic book. Thank you Marc Webb.",Null,1,5,7 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Better, bigger, more ambitious and emotionally heavier
","As the story unfolds, and all conspiracies behind Oscorp unwind, the life of our lovable web-swinger gets more adrenaline full and also more complicated. There is a bit of a sense of DeJa Vu, specially when Peter Parker is trying to balance his personal life and his super hero life. But the aspect in which this movie really shines (like his ancestor) is in the characters, however this time the emotional weight is much more present,and the scale of both the drama and action is much bigger. Andrew and Emma were just as great as in the previous movie, and the chemistry between them is fantastic. Jaime Fox also nailed it as Electro, even thou the character itself was not the best written character, but his performance was so great that i was able to overcome the writing. Dane DeHann was equally great as the Green Goblin, at first i didn't like the idea of Harry being the Green Goblin instead of Norman Osborn, but it was a good choice and it matched perfectly with the plot and tone of the movie.(Also Dane has a knack for playing psychopaths) As to be expected there are plenty CGI scenes but it really didn't bother me because the action sequences were done in a very creative way. The Score, composed by Hans Zimmer,is amazing and somewhat contemporary, so it fits the themes of each character and moment. Overall the movie was much more intense and heavier than the first installment, as our main character deals not only with supernatural challenges but also emotional dilemmas.",Null,10,23,18 April 2014
