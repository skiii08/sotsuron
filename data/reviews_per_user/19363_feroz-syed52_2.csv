The Avengers," Avengers..!! Nothing Short Of Awesomeness..!!
","Avengers..!! It would be perfect to describe this movie as nothing short of awesomeness.It's a pleasure to all the senses.!It's a kind of movie for which large screens were built i.e to provide full of entertainment..n avenges is full of promise.. The story line is simple..Earth is in danger,with otherworldly creatures having waged war.Led by Loki, the Norse God and Avenger Thor's half- brother, an army called the Chikauri attack the human race. In their way stand superheroes â€” each as formidable as the other, each dealing with his/her demons, and with each other. The way Joss Whedon handled the cast is impressive..none of the superhero felt left behind..and his direction is at top notch.. Coming to the cast Robert Downey Junior is impressive..he can be termed as 'The Jack Sparrow' of the avengers with his cheeky lines.. Chris Evans,Chris Hemsworth,Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are impressive..but the biggest surprise is Mark Rufallo as the Dr.Bruce Banner a.k.a the Hulk('the other guy')..he Delivers probably the best scenes in the movie and oh boy he steals the show big time..!! never enjoyed anything on big screen as him(The Hulk)..coming to the others Tom Hiddleston is good as a much formidable opponent to the group of superheroes, slimy and evil in equal measure. Samuel L Jackson is efficient well supported by Cobbie Smulders.. In the end to sum up The Avengers is a treat to watch..don't miss it..",10,9,18,27 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spiderman..?? No..!! 'The Amazing Yawn' Would Have Been The Apt One..!!
","Like every other Spidey fan i was disappointed when Tobey n Raimi left the Spiderman franchise..but still had expectations from The Amazing Spiderman after seeing the talented cast n the buzz this movie has created ..But,it was a Collosal Disappointment..!! The story is pretty one dimensional..and the character development is poor.. the attributes that made us to emote our feelings towards peter parker are missing..The action lacked the energy and innovativeness that Raimi had introduced with the spider-man..there wasn't a moment where i wanted to root for spider-man..Coming to the romance the chemistry between the lead pair was good but i think it was over catered for a superhero film..it wasn't necessary..Rhys Ifans lizard isn't terrifying enough to make a super villain..Emmastone has a good presence and Andrew Garfield was impressive but his character was poorly written..so even he couldn't save the sinking ship.. In the end a mark Webb and the amazing spider-man will leave you disappoint in a big way..!!",3,18,38,30 June 2012
