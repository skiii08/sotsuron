United 93," Real
","This is a very real film. It makes you feel as if you were actually on the plane at the time. Now I am not going to actually explain what the film is about because everybody should already know.Acting in this film would be hard because they have to portray real people before they die but as far as that goes the acting was great! The movie itself sort of dragged though. It almost felt like a documentary by its camera and basically whole style.Though the long attributes of this film made it a bit boring, it still proved to be good and show us a story of courage and bravery.That day of 9/11 we saw evil. This film portrays the good taking it over no matter what.",9,0,1,28 February 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," A Fairytale of Utter Bueaty and Emotion
","'Pan's Labyrinth' is by far the best foreign film I have ever seen. It focuses on a young girl's adventure to travel back to her home: The Underworld, though that is not the only storyline in the splendidly nice film.The film has lies, war, blood, loss, death, and magic, all resulting in an extraordinary fairy-tale for grown ups.The acting is good and full of remorse even though it is in Spanish. Though the whole movie is told through subtitles, it is still easy to follow and entertaining.The music really helps expand the artful vision in the magical tale. The sets, monsters, and the whole world of the film is truly breathe taking for its Gothic touch of beauty.'Pan's Labyrinth' is a charming film that is fun and exhilarating to watch. This movie is original and unforgettable. It will always be a classic dark story of believing and never letting go of hope.",10,5,11,11 February 2007
Blades of Glory," Blades of Boring
","'Blades of Glory' is a spoofing comedy on ice. Well if you want to call it comedy considering I laughed three times in the whole film.Sure the acting wasn't horrible nor was the dialog but all of the god damn cliques really killed it. This movie has been done so many times before. Needless to say, the geek falls in love with the hot girl who betrays him for the bad guys and then is sorry and gets back with the geek. I've NEVER seen that in a movie before.As far as the jokes go, there are a lot to keep a general audience laughing but please, these jokes have been told so many times in the last ten years its not even funny.If you want to see a comedy see this or any other teen comedy. They are all the same.",1,9,23,1 April 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Ride down the Road of fun with this Charming Family
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is a total laugh out loud comedy! This film is about a struggling family going to California for the family's little angel's beauty contest. All of the characters are funny and lovable.'Little Miss Sunshine' is most definitely the best comedy of 2006! Its unique and charming. The acting is great along with the music, plot, humor, and style. This dark comedy is a fun film that will be loved by those who have a sense of humor that accepts everything. Have an open mind and enjoy.So travel with this family down to your local movie store and get it today!",10,4,8,8 January 2007
Dreamgirls," Listen to the Song in my Heart
","'Dreamgirls' is about a group of female African Americans looking for fame in the early 60's. As they get higher and higher in the charts, problems brake out. Friends break up, relationships die, and dreams will break, but in the end their dreams will come back to greet them with pure talent and joy.'Dreamgirls', might just be the best film of 2006. The acting was terrific from everyone, and especially from Jennifer Hudson who was tremendous with that booming voice of hers.Tipped with an Oscar and multiple golden globes, how can this fail? See this wonderful film today and let their dreams complete yours.",10,2,5,8 January 2007
The Number 23," The Number 9/10
","'The Number 23' wasn't AT ALL as bad as it was hacked up to be by critics. It was actually very good.It features good acting, dialog, music, suspense shots, and many cool scenes including a very entertaining opening credits sequence.Though Jim Carrey is trying to be serious I just can't help but laugh at him because I just picture him doing something stupid and funny which he actually does make a couple of his...well...we know how Jim Carrey is.The movie also has some comic 'Sin City' Esq scenes that prove to be very cool.The movie has a great twist ending that leaves us with a bitter-sweet conclusion.This film is very good and I Highly recommend it.",10,1,3,1 April 2007
World Trade Center," Pretty Good but isn't Terrific
","'World Trade Center' is about two men who devoted their lives to saving others during 9/11 and end up getting caught under the ruble of the buildings destruction.Emotion runs high in this film. It will most definitely tug at your heartstrings but it wasn't the greatest. Naturally you'd think a movie about 9/11 to be a masterpiece and this most definitely was not. The acting was good and so was the plot but the film sort of dragged on with the men talking about their families in just about every scene. The movie was longer than it needed to be because truly it all could have been wrapped up in about one hour.Though this wasn't the best film ever and I would never watch it again, I'd definitely recommend this to someone who hasn't seen it yet and has a lot of patience.",6,0,1,28 February 2007
Grindhouse," A Great Movie Experience
","'Grindhouse' is two movies in one with fake trailers in between created by movie geniuses Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. With two totally different and twisted plots, 'Grindhouse' puts the thrill of watching movies back to the cinema! So let me start out with the first segment, 'Planet Terror', which was directed by Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Once upon a Time in Mexico, and many more). It was about a science experiment going bad causing a small town of Texas to be infected with a zombie plague that leads a group of miss-matches together to save the world. The movie stars Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Marley Shelton, and Josh Brolin. A great cast for a great film. The film had a talented wide-ranging cast that made the first segment of 'Grindhouse' a great zombie slasher. It had a great score from the director, amazing scenes, and a woman with a high-powered machine for a prosthetic leg. Looks like the fun 70's Grindhouse films are back! 'Planet Terror' is truly an entertaining explosion of thrills.Now let me tell you about the fake trailers in between the movies. They all were full of extreme content from other mastermind directors who brought you good films like Hostel, Cabin Fever, Shaun of the Dead, and so many more. The fake trailers are truly a fun twist to this movie of a lifetime.The next and final segment, 'Death Proof', is from one of Hollywood's greatest directors, Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2, Reservoir Dogs, Dusk Till Dawn, Jackie Brown, and Pulp Fiction). 'Death Proof' is about an aging stuntman who seeks young women to kill, but it is not you're traditional slasher flick, it is slasher Tarantino style. He kills his victims with his car. It features another wide-ranged cast. It stars Zoë Bell, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Kurt Russell, another terrific cast. 'Death Proof' may have a lot of dialog but it is good dialog. Since Tarantino is known for dialog in his films, this one proves to be no different. The movie also has the best car chase ever seen in cinematic history! The chase scene had NO CGI and Zoë Bell did her own stunts considering she is also a stunt double in real life. 'Death Proof' was a hilarious slasher flick that proves to be no better and no worse than 'Planet Terror'.So like I just said, I can't choose what movie I liked better. They were both great and Grindhouse in all would be nothing without one another, and I am happy to say that finally there is a new cult classic, and its name? Grindhouse.",10,2,6,12 April 2007
The Descent," Horror in the Caves
","'The Descent' is about a group of friends who go caving for a fun trip but it soon turns into a terrifying trip when numerous monsters attack. The character development lacks a bit but its OK because there is a lot of characters and you can tell who's who.The acting in this film is superb along with the whole movie itself. The film features suspenseful music and suspenseful scenes.This movie might just be one of the best horror films EVER. This is a new cult classic and will never be forgotten.I highly recommend this film for it is scary, entertaining, and suspenseful, but it is not for the faint heart.",10,3,7,19 January 2007
