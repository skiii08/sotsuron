Gremlins," My childhood nightmare!
","This was my first film memory. My grandad owned a videoshop and my mum mistakingly rented/borrowed This for me to watch at the age of 2/3 which started off fine as I loved it but unfortunately gave me nightmares for years to come. Looking back it's funny as this is a comedy horror but it's so well done and engaging it's unreal. A true movie classic. One of my all time faves maybe down to nostalgia but I must get this one in 3 or 4 times a year. If you want a fun, funny and frightening time then this is a must.8.4",9,0,1,8 December 2018
Aliens," If I had to watch one film for the rest of my life
",It would 100% be James Camerons Aliens. Sequals are generally rather meh but for the two sequals Cameron has provided us with they have both been 10/10 (other being T2 of course). I literally watch this film 5 times maybey more a year. There will unfortunately never be a Sci Fi film like this one again due to the modern era of over the top CGI.,10,1,3,18 August 2018
