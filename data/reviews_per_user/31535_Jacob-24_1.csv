Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," characters make better toys than anything
","I was entertained, but I found major flaws in this movie. I'm not going to complain about how cheesy this movie was, or point out technical flaws like 'Oh look, Han and Luke shot the stormtroopers to steal their armor, yet it remains undamaged when they put it on!' And I accept the style of the star wars movies; jedis will always talk with backwards syntax and there will always be cute little characters and kid-humor to appeal to the toy buyers who aren't obsessive collectors. But I think this movie takes those aspects a little too far. Conversation has never been a strong point in the movies, but there was little character development, something which this movie needed. there wasn't much in the other movies, but I felt no connection to the characters in this movie like I did with Luke or that nut Han Solo. I have heard a lot of people say the acting was terrible, which was what I was thinking at first, but then I realized that the actors didn't really have much of a character to get into, other than an accent and/or a costume. the other aspect of the movie was the marketability. its always been prevalent in these movies, but this movie is taking it too far. i mean, it's already expected to sell 2 point some billion in tickets. i'm not just saying this because greed is un-jedi-like, but i think it affected the quality of the movie. i started seeing the fight scene between the droids and the whatevers as just a bunch of toys. and that jar jar binks was only as annoying as he was because kids eat up that urkel/ninja turtle crap. good special effects, good fight scenes, good action. somehow more high-tech than the ones that are chronologically later?",Null,0,1,21 May 1999
