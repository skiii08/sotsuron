Mission: Impossible III," Better than the last still not up to the original
","While the plot is slightly better than MI2 it is still not great. That being said this movie has MUCH better action and cinematography than the last and I bet we can thank JJ Abraham's for that. The beginning definitely threw me off a bit and made it a bit more interesting I was not a fan of the plot centering around him trying to be normal, I feel like it was too early in the franchise to play that card. However still am entertaining ride despite that.",6,1,1,10 November 2019
Mission: Impossible II," Not nearly as good as the first
",Despite what the title may say this is not a bad movie. Just not as good as the first. Again the tech doesn't hold up but there aren't very many TV shows or Movies that can with the dramaticly changing technology industry. While some of the action was pretty good the plot was sub par at best.,6,1,1,10 November 2019
Mission: Impossible," Holds up daily well
",Aside from all the tech and gadgets being greatly outdated this actually holds up pretty well. Haven't seen it since it was released and had forgotten most of the movie but was actually fairly thrilling and suspenseful none the less. A classic that time will not forget.,7,1,4,10 November 2019
