Alien 3," Watch The Assembly Cut
","Despite a troubled production history and Fincher disowning it, I still thought the theatrical version is an okay sci-fi horror flick that benefited from great industrial set designs, great acting and strong dialogue, an uncompromising dark tone, and a dynamic score from Elliot Goldenthal.However, it's even better in it's Assembly cut form. The narrative flows more coherently, the supporting cast are given stronger development, and the religious theme is more pronounced. The standout performances for me are Charles Dance (who is killed way too early), Charles S. Dutton, Ralph Brown, and Paul McGann.It's still far from a great film due to issues with the script (Hicks and Newt being killed too early, the queen face hugger somehow able to impregnate twice), too many characters, it's poorly-staged corridor-heavy third act, and occasional dodgy special effects.It's not as good as Alien or Aliens, but I still think it's a good movie and would have been a suitable conclusion to Ripley's character. I certainly prefer it over anything that has come out of the Alien franchise since.",7,5,5,25 January 2018
Requiem for a Dream," A Disturbing Masterpiece
","While watching Aronofsky's uncompromisingly bleak journey into the downward spiral of four individuals living in Brooklyn, I couldn't help but think of the famous Nine Inch Nails tune Hurt.The lines, 'The needle tears a hole, The old familiar sting, Try to kill it all away, But I remember everything', bring to mind Harry's (Leto), one of our protagonists, heroin addiction.In a way both Hurt and Requiem for a Dream (RFAD) deal with similar themes regarding individuals engaging in self-harming activities (in this case, drug use) as a means to escape their empty lives.This isn't to imply that RFAD is just a simple anti-drug PSA because while the four main characters such as the aforementioned Harry, his grandmother Sara (Burnstyn), his girlfriend (Marion) and his friend Tyrone (Wayans) are each addicted to different types of drugs; what truly drives their actions are their obsession with achieving the idealistic American Dream in order to find happiness.RFAD MWWith Sara it's being on TV, with Harry and Sara it's starting their own clothing store, and with Tyrone it's the simple desire to be loved by someone like his mother did when he was a child. Protagonists with obsessions that eventually lead to their downfall is a common theme in Aronofsky's filmography whether it's clinging on to their 80's glory days (The Westler) or perfecting ballet dancing (Black Swan) and RFAD is no exception.Aronofsky has also never been afraid to get weird. Much like David Lynch, Aronofsky uses surrealism and unorthodox film-making techniques as a tool to help externalize the emotions and state of minds of the characters.This is on display with the film's then revolutionary 'hip hop montage' technique (previously used by Aronofsky in Pi) in which a large number of rapid short cuts are used to illustrate the character's transition from sobriety to intoxication.While there are plenty of crazy camera techniques and visual elements utilized throughout the movie such as body cams shots (Ex. Tyrone running away from a gang hit) and rapid visual distortion to showcase the characters suffering from withdrawal, by far one of my favorite moments is a quiet moment that features Harry and Sara talking face-to-face while lying in bed together.Instead of being in the same shot, both of their faces separated by a split-screen format. Despite saying they love each other, the cold dialogue delivery and the separation by the editing serves to illuminate the hallow-ness of their relationship. Harry and Sara are more in love with the idea of each other if anything else.There are many other tricks being used in order to immerse the audience into the subjective emotions of the characters, none more so than with Sara who as the film progresses experiences more vivid delusions of being on a potentially non-existent game show in addition to increased stress from trying to lose weight. Let's just say you will probably never be more scared by a refrigerator than when watching RFAD.Speaking of Sara, it would be a crime to discuss RFAD without mentioning Burnstyn's magnetic transformative performance. This isn't to minimize everybody else because the acting quality in general is great, heck, even Marlon Wayans (playing against type in his only dramatic role so far) more than holds his own against the likes of Connelly and Leto. If there was any weak link in the cast (if any because once again, everybody is awesome) it would be Leto due to his uneven New York accent in the first half of the film. Despite all the characters having less than admirable qualities, the acting gives each of them a level of believability that works in conjunction with the guerilla-style cinematography to lend an air of authenticity to RFAD.RFAD SaraHowever, seeing Burnstyn going through her transformation from absent-minded white- haired grandmother to a pill-popping anorexic red-haired wreck is both horrifying and an awe-inspiring testament to having dedication to one's craft. Out of all the characters, Sara is the one I had the most sympathy for since she was the most innocent out of anybody. She sincerely cares for her son Harry and wants nothing more than for him to be happy. This is what makes her 'nothing is left for me' speech to Harry simply heartbreaking. Burnstyn gives some of the best acting I've ever seen because the sadness in her delivery and expressions was so moving that even cinematographer Matthew Libatique broke into tears while shooting the scene.Needless to say, RFAD is far from an uplifting film and is easily up there with Grave of the Fireflies as being one of the saddest films I've ever seen, but it's also a great Greek tragedy-style psychological character study that isn't afraid to show the ugly side of humanity.",9,1,1,1 October 2017
It," One of the Best Stephen King Adaptations
","While the miniseries was far from perfect, it's most fondly remembered for Tim Curry's (Rocky Horror Picture Show, Legend, The Wild Thornberrys) legendary performance as the terrifying children-eater Pennywise the Clown. However, even with the over three hour runtime, certain details or story elements were still changed or entirely left out. One example being that Pennywise was much more cold and demonic in the novel as opposed to Cury's Freddy Krueger-like interpretation.Now, how much a movie is faithful or not to it's source material is of no consequence to me because most of the time..I just want to see a good movie. I don't care how much King hates Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining for being unfaithful to his original story, it's still a horror masterpiece.Having said that, I think the thing that intrigued me most about this latest adaptation of the novel was the decision to split the story into a two-parter with the first movie strictly focusing on the Loser's club story from when they were kids in the 1980's (as opposed to the 1950's in the novel) and the second one with the Loser's club coming back to Derry, Maine over twenty-seven years later to fight Pennywise again as adults.It's a strange choice from an adaptation standpoint since a key element of the novel and the miniseries was it's constant back-and-forth between the two stories in order to showcase the past's effect on the present. The adult narrative also served as the framing device for the child narrative.But in a way, while it may have sacrificed some of the nuances of the novel, keeping the first movie fixed on the past vastly improves the narrative for me because, personally, it made for a much tighter and more intense story. One of my personal pet peeves are when movies make it clear right from the outset that the characters are going to be alright because it kills any suspense. Heck, the movie itself doesn't even make it clear that there will be a chapter 2 until the very end.Plus, I always found the kid story of the Loser's Club from the miniseries much more interesting than the adult story.If I had to describe this movie, it would probably be a combination of the demonic spook- house thrills of The Conjuring series combined with the setting of Stranger Things and the antics found in 80's nostalgic classics such as The Goonies.Even though the trailers have sold It as a horror film and while it is indeed a solid horror film, this is not the movie's strongest attribute. That is because at it's heart the movie is a touching coming-of-age story with Pennywise serving more as a metaphor for the traumas and personal issues that each of the members of the Loser's club must overcome. I think it's due to this reason that the movie not only ends up being one of the best King adaptations ever, but possibly one of the best movies of the year period.This feat is thanks in no small part to the excellent cast. Bill Skarsgard ended up being a great choice to fill in the clown shoes of Curry. Skarsgard's Pennywise is every bit as creepy as he looks and I love how he gives the character a more creature-like demeanor, almost as if at any anytime the unstable Pennywise is on the verge of going full-on monster mode. The character of Pennywise is also helped by the sheer amount of terrifying hallucinations he imparts on each member of the Loser's club in order to bring out their worst memories or fears.While I will always prefer Curry's portray of the character due to the sheer amount of fun he brought to the role and the fact that he iswell.Tim Curry, Skarsgard interpretation is nothing to sneeze at either.But the true stars of the movie are the Loser's Club. For most of the movie we are strictly focused on their perspective and fortunately the quality of the acting is excellent across the board. There is literally not a single weak performance and the chemistry between the actors captures the magic of those coming-of-age classics such as Stand By Me.When it comes to acting prowess Lieberher and Lillis obviously come out on top but probably my favorite character was Richie Tozier played by Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things fame due to his endless supply of hilariously inappropriate jokes and one-liners.I also liked how the sociopathic bully character Henry Bower, played by Nicolas Hamilton who funny enough has been in TWO Stephen King movies this year (The Dark Tower and It), is given some much needed depth compared to his miniseries counterpart.While the film does not skimp out on the horror in anyway (some of the novel's darker elements are included where they were absent in the miniseries), the coming-of-age story and the child actors form the very tender human heart that makes this film seem so special compared to other film's in it's genre.I think this is why I am able to forgive a few of the film's flaws such as Chosen Jacob's character Mike Hanlon disappointingly given the shaft when it came to character development and dialogue, a couple of scare scenes suffering from less-than-optimal CGI and Benjamin Wallfisch's overall excellent moody score getting a little over-bearing at times.So if you are one of the hold outs who hasn't seen It or simply looking for a quality King adaptation to wash away the bad taste left by The Dark Tower..then what are you waiting for?!?!?!",9,3,5,1 October 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Heavy-Handed But Nonetheless Compelling Unconventional Crime Drama
","'In Bruges' director Martin McDonagh applies his dark comedy sensibilities to this unconventional but compelling crime drama that benefits greatly by knock-out performances from McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson.I think what holds this movie back a bit is that in the end, it does feel like a riff on the Coen Brother's brand of modern neo-noir that is lacking in subtlety when it comes to tackling it's broader philosophical and social themes.",8,1,4,11 February 2018
The Shining," A Horror Masterpiece
","Some may not like that the movie deviates from the novel, but The Shinning stands on its own as a definitive horror classic.Stanley Kubrick gives his signature cinematic vision with mind-blowing cinematography, eerie music, and a dream-like atmosphere. Jack Nicholson turns in one hell of a performance playing a writer descending into madness.Like other Kubrick films, the story has many layers of detail and meaning that makes the re-watch value very high.Kubrick manages to make a truly chilling horror movie, and he didn't need to turn the lights off.",10,0,1,25 January 2018
Dunkirk," Another Nolan Masterpiece
","Nolan has created another masterpiece in the form of this suspenseful and grounded depiction of the evacuation of Dunkirk.From a technical standpoint Nolan has really outdone himself from the shocking opening 10 minutes, the dogfights, and the nail-biting claustrophobic boat sequence.The performances are top-notch all-around, with Tom Hardy probably the most impressive since for most of the movie he has to act with his eyes. However, both Mark Rylance and Cillian Murphy also really knock it out of the park.Despite being yet another WWII movie, Nolan still finds a way to make it distinctly his and manages to stand out through it's focus on survival, minimal dialogue, and merciless clinical depiction of war.",10,1,4,25 January 2018
Aliens," A Superior Sequel
","One of those rare sequels that is better than the first movie in every way.James Cameron manages to take everything that was great about Ridley Scott's original 1979 film and builds on top of it to make a superior sequel.It not only maintains the claustrophobic atmosphere of the first, but I found the characters more endearing and memorable (Ex. Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez) this time around.The action is great, the creature designs are better, and the visuals are simply awesome. The Queen Alien is one of the greatest monsters ever put on screen and it's amazing that the effects were all done in camera.Aliens also feels more textured from a character and writing perspective. I love the Vietnam War/Starship Trooper aesthetic (I personally like this movie better than the actual Starship Trooper movie) and the underlying themes of motherhood that is further accented in the extended cut.I also liked how Ripley is upgraded to be an action heroine and Cameron showcases this transition perfectly. It all felt perfectly natural and in keeping with the logic of the story (I'M LOOKING AT YOU FORCE AWAKENS!!).James Cameron back in his heyday really understood that in order for all this action and spectacle to matter, you need to have compelling relatable characters to anchor it.It kinda bothers me that there is this growing trend of stereotyping the film as a 'dumber action shoot-em up' version of Alien, which baffles me to no end.Seriously, it's nearly a full hour before any gun is fired and there is literally zero moments in this story where the marines have the upper hand.",10,14,21,25 January 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Proverbial Really Good Science Fiction Movie
","Sixty years later Stanley Kubrick's proverbial really good science-fiction movie continues to draw awe, praise, and division.Regardless of whether you love it or hate it, the cultural and cinematic impact of this masterpiece cannot be denied. But despite it's wide influence, there still hasn't been quite a movie like 2001.A true experience for the eyes and the soul that takes the viewer on a journey through the history of mankind.",10,1,1,25 January 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's Directorial Debut Remains A Stylish Masterpiece
","Writer/director Quentin Tarantino explodes unto the cinematic landscape with his masterful directorial debut that quickly establishes all of his trademarks (profanity-laced poetic dialogue, pop culture references, black comedy, music juxtaposition, shocking moments of violence).Rarely do filmakers start off with a masterpiece but Tarantino directs this unconventional low-budget star-studded paranoid crime thriller like a seasoned pro.Both this and Pulp Fiction will always remain some of my favorite movies ever.",10,1,2,25 January 2018
The Shape of Water," Del Toro's Best English-Language Film To Date
","'Water is like love, it has no shape. It takes the shape of whatever it inhabits. It's the most powerful element in the universe. It's gentle, flexible, but breaks through every barrier.'-Guillermo del ToroDespite del Toro's love for comics, gothic visuals, giant mechs, and practical monster effects; the famous Spanish director has always been a bit of a romantic at heart as demonstrated by the above quote.From his more artsy Spanish films (Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth) to the more mainstream efforts (Hellboy and Pacific Rim), there is a touching reoccurring theme concerning the idea of societal outsiders and marginalized individuals finding solace within each other's company.With his fascination with fairy tales, it seemed only a matter of time before del Toro took a stab at creating a straight-out romance tale, which comes in the form of his latest feature that gives a great twist to the 'Beauty and the Beast' concept.What makes TSOW probably one of del Toro's best films since The Devil's Backbone is that taken on a pure conceptual level, the inter-species romance angle could have easily been awkward and almost kitschy if done by lesser hands. But del Toro's mathematical but delicate storytelling, impressive set designs, and the incredibly layered performances from the silent Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones, despite wearing a thick rubber monster costume, turns TSOW into one of the most touching and honest romance tales in quite a while.The performances in general are incredible across the board, arguably the best when it comes to del Toro's English-language movie canon. Hawkins is obviously magnetic in the lead but Michael Shannon as the openly racist research team leader Richard Strickland easily joins the canon of Jacinto (The Devil's Backbone) and Captain Vidal (Pan's Labyrinth) in del Toro's brand of genuinely terrifying but tragic human villains.But the person that I feel really stole the show was Richard Jenkins, playing Elisa's down-on-his-luck friend/neighbor and closeted commercial artist Giles. Giles by far feels like the most down-to-earth character in this fantastical tale and you really do feel sorry for his plight in life. For most of the movie Giles and Elisa's coworker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) have to verbalize the mute Elisa's sign language; giving way to some unique interactions. Giles also provides some great subtle moments of comic relief.Praise should also be level at the spell-binding score by Alexandre Desplat (The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, Argo), giving a film with admittedly strange subject manner a timeless classy atmosphere that further contributes to the fairy tale quality. The accordion and whistle-heavy music that plays over the film's mesmerizing opening underwater dream sequence was the first sign that I was watching something truly special.The movie on the whole has a magical Old Hollywood feel to the whole thing, which is something different compared to del Toro's previous efforts. It's not the type of Old Hollywood tribute that feels pandering either (Ex. La La Land), it all feels born out of genuine affection and is completely at the service of painting the film's intoxicating atmosphere.TSOW on the whole is a pretty unconventional movie that is hard to pigeonhole into a single genre.It's part 'Beauty Meets Beast' romance, part creature-feature, part period piece, part fairy tale, part science fiction and part spy thriller. There is also the fact that this is an R-rated del Toro flick and while it's not nearly as violent as Pan's Labyrinth, there are a few scenes that will make you wince or shiver in uncomfortableness.Even with the trailers it's obvious the distributor's Fox Searchlight Pictures could not crack the egg on how to market the movie. Hopefully it will continue to get more attention due to it's appearance on many critic's 'best of' lists and with award season underway; but regardless del Toro's latest masterwork is one of the 2017's best.",9,42,83,24 January 2018
Mother!," Worthy of the Exclamation Point!
","Even though Aronofsky has never done a straight-up horror, he sure has made some really scary films such as Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream (read my review here). That is one of the reasons that the trailer, released a few months back, for his latest creation peaked my interest because it looked like his most horror-like effort to date.One of the things that first came to mind when watching the trailer was Rosemary's Baby, which is one of Aronofsky's favorite movies. However, while mother! does prove to be his most horror-like entry to date, it is far from the jump-scare horror thriller that the trailers have sold it as and even the plot summary provided above is only the tip of the iceberg as to what this movie has in store.Instead, mother! proves to be something a lot more unconventional, daring, and absolute bonkers!!If you thought the third act of Black Swan was insane.well Aronofsky somehow manages to top even THAT with unexpected apocalyptic imagery, cannibalism and a very surreal cameo by a certain SNL alumni.This is art-house horror to the max in which nothing presented through the lens of our protagonist should be taken as objective fact (think Eraserhead, Lost Highway or even 2014's Babadook) and EVERYTHING is a metaphor meant to represent something else.To me the story is working on two levels.Level 1 is a relationship drama concerning our protagonists' (Lawrence) increasing frustration with her narcissistic husband's obsession over his art and the outside attention it brings. I can see the significant others of famous artists or celebrities relating very heavily to the drama portrayed on screen. Weirdly enough, in a case of life imitating art, both Lawrence and Aronofsky (twice her age) started dating each other during the production of this movie.Level 2 is an allegorical presentation of the Bible with Lawrence being 'mother nature', Bardem 'God', Ed Harris 'Adam' and Pfeiffer 'Eve'. The biblical metaphors only grow in prominence, and even a bit heavy-handed, as the movie progresses to its bombastic third- act. Aronofsky is at Lars Von Trier-level of nihilism, delivering an unflinching portrait of all the worst aspects and atrocities of humanity.Obviously, there is a lot to un-pack with this film, but even without the multi-leveled allegorical narrative, there is a whole lot more artistic merit that oozes from the screen. Aronofsky keeps the camera very tight and claustrophobic (don't take a drink every time the camera is close to Lawrence face because you WILL become dead drunk), creating a suffocating atmosphere of unease. The cinematography alone does a great job in establishing the geography of the couple's house and making it seem almost like another character.And even the movie's worst critics have to admit.the performances are incredible across the board. Both Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are absolutely fantastic in their roles, especially Lawrence in capturing the intense paranoia and agony that her character is going through due to the increasing amount of strange individuals that populate her husband's house. Outside of the two main leads props should also be given to Michelle Pfeiffer; who delivers some really intense and un-nerving words towards Lawrence's character throughout the story.Even though I really like this movie, I will fully admit (hopefully this isn't going to sound pretentious) that it is not for everybody. Aronofsky is not exactly known for making uplifting films and mother! is no exception. None of the characters are straight-up likable and the narrative deals with very disturbing subject manner (human cruelty, abusive relationships, environmentalism, the divine problem of evil).Now, this isn't to say art can't be unpleasant, in fact there is an argument to be made that the best art SHOULD make people feel uncomfortable, but this may account for why many of the audience members were turned off. I think another reason for why the movie is currently bombing at the box office is that it was going up against the financial juggernaut that is It (read my review here).Whether you end up thinking this is a masterpiece or a mess, there is one thing that can be said for surethe movie is NEVER boring or NOT intriguing.",9,2,8,1 October 2017
