Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," I stayed while others walked out
","Well, we should have known by the title that this movie was going to be a stretch. It was. And i pulled several muscles in my patience to make it to the end of the story. And what a really stupid story it was. Apart from the typical massive gaps in the plot that seems to be a standard these days, the idea that vampires where involved in the American civil War was just ill-conceived. And Abraham learned to tap into super human strength just by thinking of the thing he hated most and getting angry. My friends have an almost similar reaction when i mention this movie.The fight scene on the train was pretty good and the makeup on Benjamin Walker was fun. The fake nose made him look just like Liam Neesan who then morphed into Abe Lincoln. I expected silly and i got it so no hard feelings.",2,6,10,31 October 2012
Life of Pi," Brilliant, entertaining, meaningful
",As soon as The Life of Pi started and the opening scene unfolded i was drawn in and i stayed there for the entire movie. I cant recall a single moment in this film where i was not engaged and on many levels. From the beginning there was a point and a meaning. I felt that i was discovering something special throughout the movie. Director Ang Lee has captured a magic in this film. Suraj Sharma as Pi the cast away was truly authentic. Irrfan Khan was subtle and mesmerizing as adult Pi. A brilliant screen play and amazing CGI made this a film experience i have not had for sometime. The incredible thing about The Life of Pi is that its able to encompass all the complexities of faith and religion in a story that seems so simple in it conclusion. I didn't see Life of Pi in 3D but i was simply blown away by the beauty of the story and that is that faith is a matter of choice.,10,4,8,22 February 2013
Hugo," All looks no substance
","The most memorable thing about Hugo is the way it looks. Martin Scorcese has i think, created a visually beautiful motion picture and on that level, it entertains. As far as the underlying story, it is long and worn out by the time it ends, to the point where i no longer cared. There is no doubt that the story of Georges Jean Méliès, is an immensely interesting one. As the man who pioneered special effects in cinema,Méliès early life and career was surely more worthy of telling in some detail. Instead Hugo buries an interesting story in a convoluted one about a boy grieving his deceased father looking for key (sound familiar)in a train station with a carry on inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen)who was terrible in this role. The automaton was intriguing but i cant help feeling that it was just a ruse to keep me in my seat to the end of the picture.i believe there was a far more interesting story to tell that was buried in vague metaphoric double meanings that you really needed to care about to get. Overall a pretty picture but nothing memorable.",3,4,9,1 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Too little and too soon
","I will remember this movie as The not as Amazing as the other Spiderman reboot. I cant understand why this was made and not Spiderman 4. There have been suggestions that previous director Sam Raimi was unhappy with the ideas for Spidey 4 so Sony went with Webb and made this movie instead. The Spiderman hero is such a huge idea that any attempt to bring this character to life needs to be BIG This movie is not worthy. Its more a re hash of the original story with some cheap editing of the more complicated parts like the death of Peter Parkers Uncle.For me, Andrew Garfield was so weak i couldn't believe he was Spiderman, one of my favorite super heroes. Not that Tobey Maguire is that much better but he was first and he played the character of Peter/Spidey with more range.Overall I was left wondering why? There wasn't enough zing to warrant starting all over again. Too little and too soon. They should have made Spiderman 4 instead.",4,3,7,26 October 2012
Now You See Me," No Magic here
","Now you see me is a weak story that has you believing its gonna be good. That's the real trick i fell for. By the time this mish mash was over i felt like i just watched a whole series of xfactor for magicians back to back. The whole premise of a group of elite magicians drafted by a mysterious founder of a secret society to right wrongs and reap revenge using magic tricks is a bit of a stretch, and never really got off the ground. Even with the instant just add water hype i was bored. Morgan Freeman was pretty average and his character Thaddeus Badly was pantomimic. Woody Harrelson did his usual standard with his character of Merritt McKinney the master hypnotist who could hypnotize anyone. Seriously he could have just got people to hand over money instead of creating elaborate scenarios. Mark Ruffalo as Dylan Rhodes was the central character but is so weak it left the movie hollow and bland. If you haven't seen it than good for you. At the count of three you will awake and you will not want to see this movie.",2,11,18,28 December 2013
Django Unchained," Entertaining to the last frame
","Quentin Tarantino has created a sequel of sorts with Django unchained. Its a continuation of everything i can remember about why classic spaghetti westerns where and still are so entertaining. This movie sets out to entertain and it does it so well.Leonardo DiCaprio seemed a little uncomfortable and didn't seem to be as real as he usually is, but, it didn't matter because the plot and story where so interesting. Samuel Jackson played his character with his usual soulful energy and Jammie Fox played the vengeful hero with remarkable ease Christoph Waltz is in my top 5 actors along with DiCaprio and was brilliant as usual. When Franco Nero appeared it made me think that Tarantino is like a chef with his movies - he always puts just enough of the right ingredients in his creations. Django captures the magic again. If i had been charged double to see this film i would still feel i that got a bargain.",8,2,6,4 March 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight falls from the dung heap that is this movie
","i am a big fan of Christopher Nolan' first two Batman pictures so I was really looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately apart from the opening scene this movie was such a disappointing mess.The story was weak, the Batman was weak and AWOL for most of the movie. Bane the villain was just annoying and wore a contraption on his face that was never qualified or explained, and looked like a k-tel slice-o-matic strapped to his head. We are treated to a boring twist in the floppy plot later when we find the real villain is someone else, and who cared less by the time you find this out.There was a bomb that wasn't meant to be a bomb in a truck that drove around endlessly with two other decoys so no one in Gotham could find it.Scarecrow was back but not as Scarecrow. He is as a rebel magistrate that condemns all to death by ice walk across a frozen bay.Cat woman is a cat burglar and Robin is an ex-cop. The villains all drive Bat mobiles and Batman flies a space ship. Cat woman rode the Bat cycle and Robin drives a cop car. Alfred just starts crying and leaves (i felt the same way) while all the cops in the world march into a tunnel together and get trapped there. Doh! ....... LaterBane (K-tel man) was apparently imprisoned in a hole in the ground many years ago - he throws Batman down the same hole where he is helped by what i can only describe as mole monks, who can't get out of the hole themselves. They speak of a legend child who apparently was the only person who had ever successfully left the hole in the ground, i counted 2 but anyway... Bane gives Batman a big screen TV so he can watch Gotham burn but the Bat is not having it and he smashes the TV. Seriously!!!After a strategic punch in the back by a mole monk, Batmans damaged spine is cured so he starts with the sit ups and push ups and now he's ready to climb from the hole, third time lucky with the mole monks chanting for him.Now all he has to do is kill Bane which he nearly does but is foiled by a girl with a pen knife,look out!!! its the real villain. Its OK but, cause Cat women helps the Batman and he gets his space ship back. The fumbling bumbling Gordon calls the shots from a hospital bed but luckily he does manage to tackle the math (three trucks 2 are decoys - villain master mind stuff)he finally picks the right truck and disarms the bomb temporarily.By now nearly everyone knows Batman is Bruce because he keeps dropping hints or telling them outright. What?Batman takes the bomb far away, saves Gotham, goes to France with Cat women and Alfred. And look out sequel - Robin finds another Bat cave. I am not kidding this is a shlock. Chris you owe me the seven bucks I wasted hiring this pile of dung. Please have another go and do it properly this time!!!",1,11,19,29 December 2012
Looper," Not even close
","The whole premise of this story was flawed from the beginning. For SciFi fans time travel is what its all about. Its meant to be intriguing and full of conundrums that most importantly, some how make sense. All the best time travel movies have a consistency that holds the idea together. This is precisely what Loopers does not have. There where so many holes in the plot that it became impossible to go with it. If your going to beam someone to the past to be killed why do you need a Looper. why not beam them straight to the furnaces. And if you have to use a Looper why rely on him to kill himself - let someone else do it. Seriously this was just a few of the canyon like proportions of the gaps in the plot of this flop. If Bruce was not in this i would have walked way before the end. I was fooled. You don't have to be.",1,95,170,12 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," Bloated inane poop
","Get a big bucket – throw in Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant and some other known flavours. Fold in some shredded pages from an award winning novel. Add a generous amount of fake rubber noses, bad costumes and shallow characters. Add some preposterous future speaks and edit to imply meaning without actual relevance.Whisk in some weak acting along with $100,000,000. Half bake and serve in several different pans over three hours on a bed of contrived, pretentious ,irrelevant and inane poop.I hope that those who are responsible for this wearyingly dull and tedious epic are never reincarnated and have no connection with any other movie I pay to see.",1,9,20,18 February 2013
Warm Bodies," Shiny happy Zombies holding hands
","Coming up with a new idea for a Zombie movie isn't easy considering there have been so many of them. Warm bodies is different in a way that hasn't been done before and that's what makes it interesting. Nicholas Hoult plays a Zombie who still possesses a spark of humanity, nicknamed R by a girl he rescues from the other Zombies. The movie is narrated by R in the form of his confused and self loathing self talk.R reveals that Zombies take on the memories of those they eat so after tucking into a member of a Human scout team out looking for supplies, he instantly feels compelled to rescue Julie (played forgettable by Teresa Palmer). Julies father Grigio (not John Malkovich greatest moment) heads the Human colony that intends to wipe out the Zombies. The connection between R and Julie sets up a chain reaction that leads to a Zombie awakening. I enjoyed the friendship R has with fellow Zombie M (Rob Corddry). M also has a spark of Humanity inside him. Unfortunately the movie progresses to a messy and somewhat predictable conclusion. I feel more could have been done with the idea. Still i enjoyed Warm Bodies and for me it was certainly better than many other Zombie movies I've seen.",6,0,3,27 May 2013
