Hereditary," Disappointed
","The photography, setting and atmosphere were great. The acting was indifferent. Honestly didn't care if anything happened to them. The potential was definitely there to be a fantastic film but, it felt short in many ways. We all know that with the horror genre you need to suspend belief, not to expect characters to act rationally or appropriately in given situations. As another reviewer pointed out, in a few situations the characters acted and scenes presented in an incredibly unbelievable way. You make you teenage son take your young daughter (who has a serious food allergy) to a high school party without knowing the parents, friends or location. You send them both off without an Epi Pen. 'Nough said on that scenario. After the accident, no police or school involvement, no therapist. After all the suspension of beliefs, I found it difficult to enjoy the film. It's not a bad film, it was okay. I am sorry I paid for it.",3,1,5,29 August 2018
Aquaman," Being generous with a 4
","I was never a comic book fan nevertheless, I usually enjoy the movies. Loved all the Xmen, guardians of the galaxy, iron man and so on. This, not so much. The underwater CGI was fantastic. The land fight scenes were laughably bad, cring worthy. Acting and dialogue cheesy and that's being kind. The lead actor is just eye candy. Pleasant to look but, He cant act. He's best with 0 or extremely minimal dialogue (he was perfect in GOT).",4,2,4,22 July 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Ugh!
","They just should toned down a few things to give this a G rating because, this was the age level the humor was geared for. As a previous reviewer stated, it's the end of the world and the humor was that of slipping on a banana peel. The Guardians of the Galaxy series did it so much better.",1,4,9,6 May 2018
