The Avengers," Good but not great
","First of all, this is a good film. I watched it twice but it doesn't really make me think it's a good film. I watched it for the second time because I totally forgot how the movie was after a few months.Many of my friends who have always been Marvel fans insists it's an awesome film. Yeah, of course, this movie has all the superheroes you worshiped in it. But you know what? Because they are all together, I couldn't really see the performance of each single hero.As a conclusion, it's neither a bad movie or a great one. It's kind of at the 6-7 range. If you're a loyal fan, you may probably like it. Pure actions, not much drama. Just watch 'em fight.",7,3,7,25 May 2013
District 9," A must-watch movie IMO
","It's all about the relationship between humans and aliens. The aliens are OK-designed and the slum is just like normal slums lol.What is good bout this film is the storyline, I think. It somehow shows that aliens are sentimental and more willing to sacrifice for the others compared to humans. But at last, the protagonist was touched and tended to sacrifice himself to save the aliens and help them to get back to their planets. It's really a great movie. Good graphics, effects and acting. The greatness is mostly based on the story.Really hope to see more movies like this.Highly recommended!",9,2,3,25 May 2013
2012," A Great Movie
","I seriously don't know what the others had expected to see from this movie. This movie has good plot, good acting, good effects and also moral values I suppose.Although some of the scenes do not make sense, so what? As long as you enjoy it, it's a good movie, IMO.This movie keeps me interested from the beginning to the end. It's satisfactory.It's a good movie to watch it with your fellows and family. I gave it an 8 out of 10.I highly recommend it.",8,1,5,26 May 2013
Titanic," Flawless 10 out of 10
","I gave it a 10 out of 10 because it deserves it. This legendary title came out when I was 1 year old. I didn't get to watch its premiere in the cinema, sad case. My parents have told me several times how good it was and my mom had watched it 3 times.When the 3D version came out, my family and I watched it together and it's really awesome. I could hardly believe they could make such a good film in 1990's. The special effects, the technology are just unbelievably good.On the other hand, the actors are real awesome. Leonardo Dicaprio, one of my favorite male actors. He did a marvelous job in the movie. He has such good acting at his age. He's the best actor in the film, imo.No matter how good the film is, don't watch it twice in a week... I went to watch it again with my friends and it's just too boring...seriously. I could clearly remember the whole story and what would happen next.So, overall. It's a must-watch film. I can't really understand why it's not in the IMDb top 250. It's unacceptable, seriously. It's a legend, man. I understand when there are lovers, there will be haters.This movie has a overall rating of 7.6 (at this moment), which is too low for a legendary film like this. Even some pure action film can get 8+ ratings nowadays.Watch it and you'll know what a 10/10 movie should be. One of the legendary movies.",10,4,8,25 May 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Awesome
","I'm always a fan of Batman series. It has good fighting, good acting and good story lines. Though this movie has no Joker, it has Bane, which is kind of a tough adversary to Batman.Batman is the coolest superhero in my opinion. He has no special abilities nor iron suit. He fights with his own hands, of course sometimes with weapons.The special effects in this movie are as good as the previous films'. The explosions, the gunfire and whatever, it's just so good.If you like action movies, or liked previous batman films, you MUST watch this.",9,3,5,25 May 2013
Iron Man," Should've watched it
","I just watched this movie after the release of Iron Man 3. Many of my friends recommend it and say it's a real great movie. As I seldom go to cinema and the Blu-ray ain't out yet. I decided to watch the previous films.I've never watched any Iron Man film before this. I thought it's childish and won't be of much actions as he's always in the suit.After watching the film, I think I was totally wrong. It has some good acting, fighting and story(maybe). It's just much better than I expected. Though he's always fighting in the suit, I always long for him to get in the suit and fight.I guess you should really watch this film. At least give it a try :)",8,0,3,25 May 2013
