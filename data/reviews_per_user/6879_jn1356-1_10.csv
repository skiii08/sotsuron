Casablanca," The Greatest Movie Ever
","This is it. There is no movie I've ever seen I love like this one. My all-time favorite.In the first place, it is not a huge, earth-shattering epic. It is a tiny little story, about a small handful of people. It doesn't have a life-changing moral. It is merely the most perfectly cut, perfectly polished gem Hollywood has ever produced.Humphrey Bogart is Rick Blaine, the burnt-out American who has found a place to die after his heart has died in Paris. He runs a saloon, living more from force of habit than anything else, and his granite cynicism makes him irresistible to others, men and women. When the love whose loss drove him to such despair returns, his mask cracks, and his agony is so wondrous to see. We get to watch his struggle, and he gives no hints as to his final decision until he announces it at the very end.Ingrid Bergman, as Ilsa, is, clich√©d as it is, luminous. She so loves Rick, she so loves her husband. The scene where Victor, her husband, leads that stirring demonstration in Rick's, shows her face full of unadulterated adoration for him. What wouldn't I give to have any woman look at me like that! Her agony is beautiful. We all want her, and all wish we could be either of her heroes.Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, all gave such performances that they have become stereotypes.But I must pay worshipful tribute to Claude Rains. I think he has the very best lines in the movie. His cheerful cynicism, his unbridled lust, his proud greed, never bowing to the embarrassment of even acknowledging his naked hypocrisy, make him my favorite part of this great movie.This is the only movie I've ever seen I love more each time I see it. There are no great depths to plumb here, no hidden pieces of trivia for aficianadoes to find. Just a very nearly perfect story that is enjoyable time and again.'Who's On First' is the only comedy routine that is just as funny every time you hear it. 'Casablanca' is the equally-miraculous movie, just as golden every time you see it, and maybe increasing in value with every viewing.You don't have to know a thing about the time. You don't have to remind yourself, as you do with 'Citizen Kane', that this is the movie that started all these things. It shines like a star. The perfectly cut, perfectly polished gem of Hollywood.",10,1,3,18 May 2008
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Not your father's Star Wars
","Some good friends of mine went Thursday evening, and only said, 'Dark, we won't be taking our children to see this.'I add the word 'Brilliant'.If you need fluffy fantasy space opera, you're not going to enjoy this. If you need Jedi masters and Sith lords doing the impossible, there's not much here for you.If everything absolutely, positively has to be all right at the end credits, you probably should stay away.If you're prepared to face the reality that evil sometimes becomes strong and the only way to fight it is to fight to the death, literally to the death, you may find this as good a movie as I did.Right from the first, there is no blaring fanfare, no yellow letters running diagonally back, back, back into infinity. My first reaction was, 'Hmm, that doesn't sound like John Williams music.' And it wasn't. Michael Giacchino, who gave us the fine music for the latest Star Trek movies, scored this. There are the necessary referrals to John Williams' music, but no more than is necessary.Then there is egregious murder and ruthless Imperial bullying. There is the gritty life of the underbelly of those who either resist, or at least don't cooperate with the great Empire.So much has been made of the blind monk Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen. He's a great character. He's no Yoda, but he doesn't need to be. In fact, for this story he needs NOT to be.The great revelation to me was K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, whose voice is provided by Alan Tudyk. I wish that had been C-3PO's character! I can show his character in one line, spoken with that flat, almost-depressed tone: 'I'll be there for you.' (Jyn looks surprised) 'The captain said I had to.'Most blessed of all, there is no one who has never had any training but who, suddenly, miraculously, is a master of the force, and no one is more surprised than she/he. There are none of the rabbit- out-of-a- hat surprises that Star Wars has done better than any other franchise. For instance, when suddenly the grim, grizzled veterans look to pretty young Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) for leadership, it makes perfect sense.Lastly, in order to defeat an almost-omnipotent Galactic Empire, somebody's going to have to die. And it may be somebody you love. Be prepared.This may be the best chapter in the Star Wars saga, because, beyond all hope, it is the most real.",10,4,9,19 December 2016
Gandhi," Everything Hollywood wants people to think it is--thin, tan, and moral
","How do you make an audience sit that long and not be bored? By making sure your long movie is a great movie.Sometimes movie biographies don't work. 'Chaplin', for instance. You lose a great performance trying to get the whole story in. Attenborough managed to distill the earth-shaking career of Gandhi into a brilliantly enthralling story. Eight Academy Awards, and it truly earned them all.When Gandhi died, Albert Einstein said, 'Generations to come, it may be, will scarce believe that such one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.' Attenborough made this unbelievable paragon human, explained much of his passion, showed him in his weaknesses, in his errors, in his humanity, and, therefore, truly in his greatness.If I could want anything from this movie it did not give me, it is this: what a shame they couldn't find an Indian actor to play the part; somehow ironic that it was a British actor chosen to play the Mahatma. Not that I'm criticizing Ben Kingsley; he did a great job and he earned his Oscar. But...",10,3,7,4 March 2007
Spirited Away," An Anime Alice in Wonderland
","There are about a half dozen things I want to see over and over because I am sure there are gold nuggets buried here I haven't mined yet.This movie is so magical, so mystical, so beautiful it leaves me breathless. It leaves me with a huge list of questions I cannot answer. Is it a real experience? Is it a dream? Is it a magical spell? What really happened? Are the characters symbolic or allegorical? (Should I study Japanese mythology to learn more?) Chihiro is moving to a new home. A spoiled brat, unhappy in the back seat of her parents car, she is taken, unwilling, into a strange world when her father takes what he thinks is shortcut that becomes a dead end. Tired of driving, he wants to explore. Chihiro is afraid, but she is more afraid of being left behind.They find what seems to be an abandoned theme park, where her hungry parents come on a restaurant. They sit down and start to eat. Chihiro is too nervous to eat, so she wanders off. When she comes back, her parents have magically been turned into pigs. And so the magic begins.You don't need to write a master's thesis on this movie to enjoy it. You don't need to answer any of your questions to enjoy it. In fact, this movie stays with you. Its scenes will wake you at night with insights and beauty. The music will haunt you, though I challenge you to remember a single musical theme.I have experienced genius here. I am in awe.",10,2,3,4 March 2007
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Vamp of a Lifetime
","So the Money asked Peter Jackson if he could stretch The Hobbit out to three movies. And he did.I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies, because I accept the fact that they are not J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings movies, they are Peter Jackson's. So, these movies are Peter Jackson's. He has the right to rewrite whatever he wants. And he and his staff have done their homework, and taken liberally from others of Tolkien's writings, and extrapolated well on things Tolkien hinted at and never really portrayed.This second movie of the three has moments of magic and beauty. There were moments where I gasped and moments where I laughed in delight.There were more moments where I drummed my fingers in frustration and tedium. The tedium was in the frequent (of course) and interminable fight scenes. The tedium was in all the special effects, all the CG. Technologically wonderful, though no more wonderful than many other movies that have come out lately.Only one or two of the magic came from CG.The best moments of the movie came when Peter Jackson lets the whiz-bang out step back from center stage and let his fine actors do what they do- -act.Evangeline Lilly is wonderful as Tauriel. Tauriel is a non-royal sylvan elf who has caught the eye of King Thranduil's royal son Legolas (remember him?). She doesn't have the otherworldly beauty of Liv Tyler's Arwen from the previous series. She looks more this-worldly. But she is no less beautiful. In one extreme closeup, her famous freckles show, and she is stunning!Tauriel is as good a warrior as any male. She is also a strong minded woman who cares deeply. So deeply, in fact, that she is willing to break rules and orders. And Ms. Lilly plays her to perfection. Watch her face when she converses, watch her reactions. Wonderful!Worst of all is the near-total waste of the magically-talented Martin Freeman. Well have some more experienced and famed actors fumed with jealousy that Mr. Freeman can stand, wordless, and express three or four emotions silently with his common-as-mud Everyman's face. As I drove away from the theater, I whimsically said, 'It's a shame Martin Freeman had only four lines.' My daughter said, 'He had more than four lines!' I said, 'Okay, six. Eight, tops.'He has more lines than that, and, brilliant movie actor that he is, lines actually can get in the way of his acting. But so can a heavy- handed director who loves computer generated effects than he does actors.Ultimately, the public enjoys spectacle and movie magic. But what we really want is good story-telling. Peter Jackson more or less tells one-third of the story of the novel The Hobbit. But he doesn't really do it all that well. Acceptably, but no more than acceptably.",7,1,4,15 December 2013
Moulin Rouge!," If for no other reason...
","You should see this movie for the beauty of Nicole Kidman, if for no other reason. I think her supernatural beauty reached its unprecedented peak in this movie. Her first appearance, a close-up of her face, is the most breathtaking show of female beauty since the violent eye of Elizabeth Taylor shocked us in the beginning of 'The Taming of the Shrew'.You should see this movie for Jim Broadbent, if for no other reason. It is embarrassing to have to admit it, but I had no idea what this amazing actor could do until I saw this. I had seen him in 'Bridget Jones', where he is spectacularly underused. I had seen him in 'Iris', where he is heartbreakingly brilliant. Later, I would see him in the Harry Potter series, where, like all the other actors of note, he got paid for doing tragically little. He, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, and on and on, lent their names, got well paid, and did little more than propping up younger actors. Broadbent sings, he mugs, he dances, he is hilarious, he is farcical, he is cynical, he is tragic. He is a one-man acting army in this.You should see this movie for Ewan McGregor, if for no other reason. He's almost as pretty as Nicole. But who knew he could sing? And sing he does, wonderfully. And he will make you cry.You should see this movie for the music, if for no other reason. Baz Lurhmann's cheerful anachronisms are hilarious and wonderful, starting with 'The Sound of Music', going through a stellar medley of '60's hits, highlighted with Elton John's 'Your Song', and reaching a farcical peak with a dance number to 'Like a Virgin' which will leave you in pain with laughter. Listen for a grand operatic rendition of Sting's 'Roxanne', which will knock your socks off! You should see this movie for Baz Luhrman, a writer and director who can pull off this improbable, impossible movie, make you swallow it, and make you love it.You should see this movie!",9,1,4,28 November 2013
Beauty and the Beast," It's not New York Metropolitan Opera vocal quality. AND I DON'T CARE!
","DISCLAIMER: I am head-over-heels in love with Emma Watson. I am predisposed to love anything she does because she does it.DISCLAIMER: I am head-over-heels in love with Alan Menken. If he writes the music, I'm there.DISCLAIMER: I love loving things. I hate hating things. It makes no sense to me to equate intelligence with the ability to find fault. Sometimes I see what they were going for and applaud the effort. Sometimes I see what they were going for and weep at how badly they missed it.That being said, I LOVED the new 'Beauty and the Beast'. I was wiping tears from the corners of my eyes frequently for sheer beauty.The original cartoon I loved. Even though there were holes in the plot you could drive a battleship through. They fixed all the plot holes! Go see it, if only for that! Okay, okay, Emma Watson isn't a classically-trained coloratura soprano. She's no Paige O'Hara vocally. For that matter, I missed Jerry Orbach when Ewen MacGregor was singing 'Be Our Guest' and I missed Angela Lansbury in Emma Thompson's 'Beauty and the Beast'. I understand Orbach is no longer available and the supernatural Ms. Lansbury, in her 90's, probably couldn't do the song the justice she did a quarter of a century ago. Guess what. I DON'T CARE! They did justice to the songs. They didn't do brilliance with the songs. I don't care.Emma has a divinely expressive face that carries her emotions perfectly for the big screen. Her Belle was glorious.Is it possible to miscast Kevin Kline? He is brilliant. And his Maurice is delicious. His singing, still not New York Metropolitan Opera quality, carries the song.Luke Evans does just the lightest touch of camp in playing Gaston. I reveled in it! Once again, not the vocal quality of Richard White, and I did miss that amazing bass. But the baritone/tenor carried it off.Now, let's get to Josh Gad.Bill Condon did the lightest hat tip to the Gender Community with Josh Gad's Lefou. If you blink, you might miss it. If you're terrified your little ones might get gay cooties on them and grow up 'perverts', by all means skip this show. But you'd probably better not let them watch any television, listen to any music, or attend any movies, because the portrayals there are not teensy hat-tips. They are full-body bows and curtsies.Now for the real star of the show: The music.Alan Menken is a living miracle. He does things with a musical score and songs that blow me through the wall! All the new songs are brilliant! Beast's song of pain over Belle is stunning. THOSE vocals are magnificent! I've always loved the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'. It is full-blown grand opera, and makes me wish Alan Menken would write a sure-enough opera.This movie dazzled me visually, musically, and emotionally. Yes, there are some things that seemed to me flaws. Guess what. I don't care! You have my highest recommendation.",10,10,25,18 March 2017
Love Actually," The Impossible Movie
","The perfect movie is not a huge, earth-swaddling epic. It is a simple thing, a small story, one that fits in a 1 1/2 to 2-hour span. 'Casablanca' is the greatest, a perfectly polished little gem, the story of two former lovers who bump into each other again in the shadow of World War II. 'The problems of two people doesn't matter a hill of beans...' But they make amazing movies. More is not better in movies. More is simply more.In other words, to try to interweave more than a couple of stories together in one movie is idiotic.Let's see. There's the new Prime Minister who gets a crush on a cute girl who works in 10 Downing Street. There's his sister and her husband, a respectable middle-aged couple with fairly typical behavior- problem kids, and a wicked secretary waiting in the wings to try and destroy it all. There is the writer whose lover jilts him with his brother, who goes to Portugal to write his next novel and becomes enchanted with his housekeeper. There's the cute couple who meet on the job--their stand-ins for a porn movie. There's the man whose wife has died recently and left him with a stepson going through his first crush. There's the aging rock star with the intoxicated leer who is looking for lasting love. There's the lovely young woman with the mentally ill brother. How many is that so far? That's not all the stories.But not only do they work together in one movie, THEY WORK TOGETHER BRILLIANTLY!My standing joke is somebody has to have sold his/her soul to the devil. In this case, it's writer/director Richard Curtis, who also gave us 'Mr. Bean', 'Notting Hill', and 'Bridget Jones' Diary', to name a few.If I haven't convinced you, maybe this will: Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman (as the male porn movie stand-in!), Laura Linney, and (in a support role!) Keira Knightley. What more do you need?If you haven't seen it, see it. Prepare to fall in love with love again. All kinds of love.",10,3,5,10 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," I owe Peter Jackson an apology
","My take on Peter Jackson is that he is an adolescent horror film maker, and that he thinks his audience is so stupid that they can't understand the good guys are in trouble unless he puts them in so deep they cannot get out without some kind of deus ex machina. That's why his 'King Kong' is so bad. I have reconciled myself to his Lord of the Rings trilogy by thinking of it as PETER JACKSON's Lord of the Rings, and after all he put into it, he has the right to rewrite as he pleases.The second installment of The Hobbit is painful, 'WAY too long, with many, many more contrived battle scenes than anybody needs, especially since the only battle in the book is with the spiders. The rest never happened, so to speak.I did not go to the theater today expecting much. I left with a headache from crying.I owe Peter Jackson an apology.Yes, he changed things. Yes, his changes were unnecessary. But some of them are so good, I actually think I prefer his version to Tolkien's in places. I will not go into details, I will include no spoilers. Surely everyone knows he found a way to include Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and he created an elf-maid-warrior Tauriel (the luminous Evangeline Lilly). Furthermore, I believe everyone knows he contrived an unlikely romance between Tauriel and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner, who is almost as pretty as Ms. Lilly). Did you know he made the romance work cinematically? Watch for it. (They who have read the novel knows Kili does not make it out alive. Have a hanky ready) The additions, Gandalf's encounter with The Necromancer, and walk-ons by Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Saruman (Christopher Lee), and Elrond (Hugo Weaving) is no secret either. Tolkien never fleshes out the story, so if Peter Jackson elects to portray it, good on him! He did good.Oh, and I don't read all the pre-release stuff. When I recognized the voice of Billy Connolly as Dain, I was delighted! He is a wonderful addition! My opinion: this is the best of the trilogy by far. I may prefer it to the any of the original trilogy!",10,9,18,27 December 2014
Princess Mononoke," A Beautiful New Sylvan Mythology
","My daughter makes me watch these. Nine times out of ten I'm glad. This time I was ecstatic! Ashitaka's village is threatened by a demon boar. In killing the boar, Ashitaka's arm takes on the infection that has turned the boar into a demon. He must leave his village, knowing his fate, knowing that when he fully becomes a demon, he could kill them all.In his travels, he encounters a huge range of characters and situations, ending with what I can only call a great mythology. The movie is breathtaking.One thing I truly love about this show (I hope this isn't a spoiler) is that in the end there are no villains. There are antagonists and protagonists, but everyone is genuinely, sincerely doing what she or he thinks is the best thing. This is a great, artistic, true expression of how things usually are. A great lesson.",9,7,13,4 March 2007
