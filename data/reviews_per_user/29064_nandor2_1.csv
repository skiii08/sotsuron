Raiders of the Lost Ark," a tad overrated
","So, I'm sure no one agrees with me, but this is not one of the greatest movies ever made. It's OK. Downright mediocre.The one thing it has going for it is the action element. And if you've seen any modern action movies, it'll feel like this movie's moving at 2 miles per hour. It starts off well, and then, it gets really slow.There's some funny parts, but they're spread out, so boredom can ensue.It's supposed to be charming because well, it's Harrison Ford, and it is, but only to an extent, and once again, be wary of slowness.I'm not saying slow movies are bad. I'm saying slow movies that are written like action movies kind of are. I think 'Last Crusade' is much more polished than this one.",5,10,24,29 November 2006
