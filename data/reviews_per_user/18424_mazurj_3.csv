The Blair Witch Project," I would have fallen asleep ...
","I would have fallen asleep if it hadn't been for the people next to me laughing at the movie. Talk about overly hyped. This movie was a crossbreeding of Road Rules and some really really bad Stephen King knock-off. If you must see it, go see a matinee - it is not worth a full-price ticket. I get scared easily, but this movie just didn't do it.",1,1,3,2 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Parody at its best
","This was one of the funniest parodies I have ever seen. And what a timely movie, as we go on blaming the entertainment industry for everything from fat kids to the Columbine shootings. I do not know anyone who did not consider this movie to be extremely applicable to our modern culture.",Null,0,0,2 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," not all that
","I would place this movie in the 'nondescript' category. The acting was definitely very good, but I guess my blah reaction is caused by everybody else's reaction to 'that cool ending.' Come ON, people!!!! I knew nothing about this movie when I walked into the theatre (except that it was apparently a clever movie), and I was able to figure out the ending within the first half hour. It was that obvious. It seemed to me as if the screenwriters were having such a good chuckle knowing what the ending was going to be that they kept beating you over the head with little inside-joke clues. Frankly, I felt as if I were bleeding from being beaten over the head during the hospital scene and the jewelry store scene. If those two scenes had not been so incredibly overdone, then I would have been a lot more surprised at the end.",2,1,3,22 August 1999
