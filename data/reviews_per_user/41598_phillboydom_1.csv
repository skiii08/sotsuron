Men in Black 3," Will Smith is da man
","Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back and it is just as good as the first and second one. Will Smith comes back and is even more cool. Josh Brolin fits unbelievably into the young role of agent K, Josh plays the role so well with the same facial movements (or lack of in this case)he plays the same voice its as if tommy lee Jones actually acted it twenty years ago. The special effects continue to be amazing with fantastically real aliens and fight scenes with aliens. MIB 3 continues to be hilarious and interesting. The story is compelling and gripping, you will be drawn in by the detail for example early on agent K says 'don't talk about your father like that' or something similar and at first thinking this is just K being like a father figure to J and sort of teaching him however then you start to think this is important which later leads to a brilliant finale to the film being very sad and happy to realise J's past. This film will have you laughing, almost crying and intensely interested, one word EPIC!!",8,2,4,18 July 2012
