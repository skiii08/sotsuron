The Sound of Music," The Hills Are Still Alive
","In the Oscar race for Best Picture of 1965 two of the year's biggest productions ran neck and neck to vie for the prized gold-plated statuette. In the end, both films won 5 Academy Awards but Robert Wise's family oriented songfest THE SOUND OF MUSIC triumphed over David Lean's somber Russian epic DOCTOR ZHIVAGO to pick up the top picture prize. The odds makers in Hollywood had predicted a certain win for MUSIC , and it did seem that the Hollywood establishment preferred the joyous strains of Maria Von Trapp's guitar to Yuri Zhivago's plaintive balalaika. There were some disgruntled movie fans who felt that the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical was an awfully lightweight choice for such a prestigious honor. Surely ZHIVAGO had more dramatic heft (granted the Trapp family had to deal with the Nazis but the song and dance element diminished the reality quotient). The only other serious contender for the year's best was John Schlesinger's contemporary British comedy of manners DARLING starring the stunning (Best Actress) Julie Christie as an amoral model living among the jet set. The less popular SHIP OF FOOLS ( a rather ugly soap opera aboard a cruise liner ) and A THOUSAND CLOWNS ( a cute, at times acerbic little comedy) were pretty much 'also-rans' from the start. With the passage of nearly 40 years the reputations of both 1965's big Oscar winners have grown in stature. ZHIVAGO is the model of panoramic, epic storytelling ; as for THE SOUND OF MUSIC , it is by far the most technically proficient of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein film adaptations.Veteran director Robert Wise is the genius behind the movie's success. Although the sticky sentimentality of the original Broadway show remains intact, Wise, along with his topflight crew of film technicians ( cinematographer Ted McCord, production designer Boris Levin and film editor William Reynolds ) truly make this a motion picture experience. The story of a rebellious novice who takes a temporary leave from convent life to care for the seven 'incorrigible' children of a stern widower and army captain was perilously close to being a dusty museum piece on the stage.Wise and company changed all that by making a movie that really moved, from the stunning overhead shots of the Austrian alps, lakes and countryside to the thrilling introduction of Maria as the TODD-AO camera in all its glory swoops down to meet the outstretched arms of the glorious Julie Andrews as she begins her unforgettable rendition of the title song . No other score of Rodgers and Hammerstein had the care and attention lavished on it as this one did. Irwin Kostal's orchestrations are sublime, perhaps the most beautiful ever heard in a movie musical ; it's one of those rare instances where the motion picture soundtrack outshines the original Broadway Cast album. THE SOUND OF MUSIC will always have its detractors. The plot creaks and the dialog doesn't run very deep. It's not MY FAIR LADY. But it is the work of a major film craftsman at the height of his powers , giving the audience a larger -than-life experience. They don't make them like this anymore. THE SOUND OF MUSIC is an enduring entertainment.",10,1,7,23 September 2002
Finding Neverland," Fantasy Land
","FINDING NEVERLAND is a beautifully produced costume drama. Technically the movie is very impressive, boasting excellent acting, gorgeous cinematography, sets, costumes and a lovely music score that mimics composer Edward Elgar's more wistful compositions. The recreation of Edwardian England rivals the best Masterpiece Theater productions. But there is a huge hole in the center of this movie that prevents Finding Neverland from being anything other than a four hankie tearjerker.The true-life story of famed novelist and playwright J.M. Barrie's friendship with the Llewelyn Davies family is given short shrift by a screenplay that insists on telling the tale as a genteel fantasy. Although the dark undercurrents of the story are there, David Magee's script (based on Alan Knee's stage play) elects to tell only part of the story and as a result much potential dramatic tension is lost.There is nothing unusual about movies veering from the hard facts of biography. To make a an effective audience-pleaser it is often essential that real-life events be juxtaposed for effective cinematic storytelling. But in the case of Finding Neverland the actual events surrounding Barrie's life and relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and her five sons were so inherently dramatic that changing the story even minimally seems innocuous at best.Unsurprisingly the best scenes in Finding Neverland deal with the creation, rehearsals and opening night premiere of Barrie's classic play, PETER PAN. The mawkish sentimentalism that pervades the rest of the movie is missing in these riveting scenes that swiftly chronicle the emergence of an immortal masterpiece.James Matthew Barrie was a complex and eccentric genius whose decades-long relationship and obsession with the Llewelyn Davies boys was by turns nurturing , exploitive and ultimately tragic. Johnnie Depp, tall and handsome, cuts a dashing figure as Barrie, an incongruity considering that the famed author was a slight individual endowed with average looks. Depp's performance, while perfectly workmanlike, displays none of the dark moods Barrie was known to have. The actor simply seems to be a conjurer of fanciful tales, a charming babysitter to Sylvia and her sons and a jilted husband to his self-absorbed, philandering actress/wife.The real story is heartrending and unforgettable. The movie is entertaining up to a point but it should prove disappointing to anyone with even a passing familiarity to Barrie's life and the world he created for the Llewelyn Davies boys. Andrew Birkin's biography J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys gives a thorough and fascinating account of this disturbing and epochal love story.",5,1,3,27 February 2005
Brokeback Mountain," One Of The Greatest American Movies Of The Past Quarter Century
","From the pages of Annie Proulx's poignant, sparingly written short story screen writers Larry McMurtry and Diane Ossana have woven an epic love story for the screen and with director Ang Lee guiding a perfect cast have created in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a motion picture that ranks with the great classics of the past. So much has already been written and discussed regarding this prematurely famous film that it seems superfluous at this point to add another comment. But what I find amazing about this film is its dichotomy: on the one hand there is all the current brouhaha concerning the screenplay's 'controversial' subject matter. At the same time here is a movie that dutifully follows the pattern of good, old fashioned Hollywood -style film-making. The 20 year saga of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, their passionate love thwarted by convention and bigotry is given the full throttle treatment by Ang Lee who dares to take the time to tell this story at a leisurely pace. The film's opening section is deliberately paced but never boring. And as we come to know the characters of Ennis and Jack and their time on Brokeback Mountain, the rest of the story becomes an emotional journey for the audience as well. Once off the mountain, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN gains momentum. If the film's longer second half veers into soap opera, as some critics have charged, then it is soap opera of the most riveting and utterly believable sort.Mere words cannot do justice to the performance Heath Ledger gives in this film. His Ennis is a man whose laconic nature barely hides the anger and passion just underneath the surface. I can't recall another performance where such inchoate feelings of love and loss have been so brilliantly rendered. The final minutes of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN are as heartrending as any you will see on the screen. Jake Gyllenhaal compliments Ledger's performance beautifully. His Jack is all feeling and frustration, a sweet-tempered man whose dream of sharing a life with Ennis is seemingly quashed at every turn.Technically labeled by some as a western and/or cowboy movie due to its setting, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is really a universal story. However, time (the early 1960s through the early 80s) and place are evoked so completely that one feels immersed in those Wyoming mountain pastures (actually filmed in Alberta ,Canada for the early scenes). As with every other aspect of this film, the cinematography is stunning. Clear mountain lakes mirror majestic skies and pines; a lone campfire, an orange dot on a mountainside, is nearly swallowed in the immense darkness of night; sheepherders guide their lambs, ewes, dogs and mules through vast mountain terrain, one particular shot photographed from what seems like a perch on the moon; small western towns; garish, neon-lit Country Western bars; a nighttime Fourth of July celebration and weathered ranch homes, barns and trailers are registered just as beautifully. This is a movie where grace and grit go hand in glove. Rodrigo Prieto's camera work is flawless.Ang Lee's achievement cannot be underestimated. He has pulled off an incredible hat trick in making a film that all audiences can relate to. No doubt there are many people who will resist going to see this film, but it will be their loss. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is an ineffably sad tale : an elegy for dreams never achieved and roads not taken. It is an American masterpiece.",10,19,22,29 January 2006
Insomnia," North To Alaska...
","A small commuter plane flies precariously over an eerily foreboding, ice encrusted Alaskan landscape at the beginning of INSOMNIA , director Christopher Nolan's spectacularly picturesque thriller. Its occupants, senior detective Will Dormer [ Al Pacino ] and his younger assistant Hap Eckhart [ Martin Donovan ] have been called to a remote Alaskan hamlet by the local police chief, a former cohort who once worked with them at their base of operations in Los Angeles. Summoned by their friend to help solve the brutal murder of a local high school girl , the invite also serves as a temporary buffer for Dormer, who is the subject of an Internal Affairs investigation.The opening of this picture sets the tone for the entire film ; buffeted by high winds and choppy seas below, the tiny plane cautiously descends amid misty gray clouds pierced by mammoth , spruce covered mountains. Once on land , the plot takes hold of the viewer and never lets go, and leads detective Dormer on a disturbing cat and mouse pursuit that finds the killer all too quickly, but that is really not the main concern of this movie. Once the culprit is found, the ingenious screenplay then reverses things by having the mouse control the cat and ultimately both cat and mouse deceitfully aiding and abetting each other. This is the only way to hint at plot details without giving the movie away; as grim as the proceedings are, this is a hugely entertaining film graced first and foremost by a brilliant performance by Al Pacino as the beleaguered Dormer. Beset by his own demons, Pacino's character is also besotted by lack of sleep, initially provoked by problems back home but aggravated by Alaskan 'white nights', a phenomenon in northern most areas where summer skies don't darken but take on a late afternoon ambiance.Watching Pacino 's transformation from seasoned professional to a haggard husk of a man is fascinating. The scene at the Inn where Pacino rages on the phone to his testy superior in L.A. is acting of the highest order. Also commendable is Martin Donovan in his small role and Hilary Swank , the remarkable actress from BOYS DON'T CRY, superb as an eager detective assisting Pacino. The wild card in this movie is the appearance of Robin Williams as a writer of middling crime novels, a character so creepy it is jarring to see Williams essay this role, until you realize how fully he inhabits the character. It is a chilling performance. On a technical note, this is one of the most remarkable feats of film editing I've witnessed in years [ the entire section where Pacino pursues a hooded figure from a mountain cottage into the craggy gray mist deserves an Oscar unto itself! ]. Last but not least, the use of the panavision camera makes full use of the stunning locale, thanks to Wally Pfister's painterly camera eye.Panavision's rectangular configuration makes a perfect frame for this film, and Pfister's compositions and color timing immerses you into the picture. This is Christopher Nolan's first film since MEMENTO , an oh-so clever film noir that told its story backward, a neat directorial hat trick but one I found exasperating to sit through. This time he tells a more linear tale and in the process has made a better movie.",8,0,0,17 June 2002
Crash," Totalled
","Watching writer-director Paul Haggis' new film 'Crash', I couldn't help thinking about another, much better film with a similar interlocking storyline. That was 'Amores Perros' (2001), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's gritty, no-holds-barred meditation on the lives of some fictional citizens in modern day Mexico City. Although the story was an obvious set-up, with a terrible car crash at its center and how that crash affected the lives of several disparate characters, the movie managed to be engrossing and utterly believable in its depiction of varying social castes in a huge metropolis. The film had the feel of a documentary and was so epic-sized in depicting the teeming life of a city that it managed to triumph over the screenplay's contrivances.'Crash' is a whole other story. Although I can admire the intentions of its creator and the admirable work of a talented cast, the movie didn't work for me on any level. An ambitious contemporary parable about the need for racial tolerance and understanding, 'Crash' offers up a nearly endless series of angry rants and speeches by characters who literally collide into each other on the highway or verbally clash in elegant homes, 'mom and pop' grocery stores or utilitarian HMO offices. The movie is a frustrating experience because the acting by the entire cast is superb and there are several powerfully dramatic scenes.Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser are perfect as a wealthy suburbanite couple obsessed with image. In fact Bullock has never been better, commanding the screen as a spoiled district attorney's wife whose prejudices erupt when her SUV is hijacked by two young black men. Matt Dillon is equally impressive as a bigoted LAPD cop who sexually harasses a woman whose car he has pulled over, only to attempt to save the same women in a horrific car accident the next day. A hotheaded Iranian store owner unjustly berates a Mexican American locksmith for not fixing the door to his liking after the store has been broken into and burglarized the night before. All these story elements (and several others) come to a dramatic conclusion that is at once operatic as it is mechanical. The fine acting, the grainy, unvarnished cinematography, the taut editing and a foreboding, mournful score can't compensate for the fact that 'Crash' is an exercise in manipulation. Paul Haggis allows his characters to preach to the choir instead of giving them a narrative that relies less on shouting and coincidence and more on credible storytelling techniques.",4,7,20,21 May 2005
Lost in Translation," A Dazzling Wisp Of A Film
","David Lean's unforgettable 1946 film 'Brief Encounter' set the standard for cinematic love stories concerning characters who meet by chance in way stations, be it the dingy train depot in 'Encounter' or the austere luxuriousness of Tokyo's Hyatt Hotel in Sofia Coppola's new movie, 'Lost in Translation'. Nearly 60 years separate the two films and yet they share a kinship that makes both films unique. Unconsummated love is not a popular subject among today's screenwriters and even a classic on the order of 'Brief Encounter' was met with some derision by critics and audiences alike. Seen in 2003, 'Brief Encounter ' still has the power to grip audiences with its tale of an unhappy suburban wife and mother who fatefully meets a London physician while waiting to take an afternoon train home and starts a timid affair with the man, himself married. Furtive meetings ensue until the woman , racked by guilt and self doubt, ends the relationship. In 90 minutes of sublime film-making, master director Lean transported his World War 2 audience into a world of newfound love, simultaneously exciting and dangerous and finally heartbreaking in its finality. A deceptively ordinary story of two 'ordinary' people was made riveting through brilliant directing , acting, editing, scoring and sound.Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation' does not reach the artistic level of David Lean's masterwork but it is a very good movie. From its ravishing opening shots of nighttime downtown Tokyo as observed by Bill Murray in a cab to the closing shot of another cab speeding away from the city leading Murray to the airport and home, this new film consistently engages the audience's attention, even when the screenplay seems almost non-existent. An American movie star in Japan to film a whiskey commercial, Bob Harris (Murray) arrives in a jet lag stupor from which he never seems to fully recover. Ensconced in Tokyo's spacious but sterile Hyatt Hotel, Harris gets only a fitful night's sleep, then arrives at the studio the next morning to film his whiskey commercial. This sequence, one of several, showcases Murray in spectacular fashion. An increasingly frustrated Japanese director and a genial translator try to convey to the American actor what they want in the scene. Murray's reactions are priceless. His performance in the entire film is a marvel and the best acting he has ever done.Complimenting Murray beautifully is Scarlett Johannson as Charlotte, the young American wife of a roving photographer of a rock band. The couple is also staying at the hotel, with husband John often away on assignment. Lonely Charlotte, feeling neglected by John, meets Harris one night in the hotel bar, and an innocent friendship results. Harris is nearly 30 years older than Charlotte but their May -December romance is wistful and consists mostly of late night talks, spur of the moment adventures in the big city and sharing a bed fully clothed back at The Hyatt. Through all this director Coppola casts an observant but unobtrusive eye on the proceedings. The movie is very strong in capturing the cultural differences between American and Japanese sensibilities, often to hilarious affect. In fact Coppola's penchant for concise observation goes a long way in covering for the unsubstantial screenplay, some of it obviously improvised. However, the acting by the principals is so strong, and Ms. Coppola's direction so self assured that the story effortlessly glides along, despite a few detours along the way that threaten to stop the film in its tracks.The crux of the story centers on the Murray/Johannson romance, and it is truly sweet. When Murray converses on his cell phone to his wife in The States, we are privy to enough information to know that the marriage has soured. Charlotte spends a lot of time at the beginning of the film sitting on her hotel window sill, looking down on the vast Tokyo cityscape, her eyes brimming with tears. This is a movie about two lonely souls looking for fulfillment. Technically superb, with dazzling color cinematography, gorgeously ambient sound and an eclectic music score, this loosely structured film ends on a fairly pedestrian note, but even so it is deeply moving.Bill Murray's great performance has a lot to do with that, and he is ably abetted by the lovely Scarlett Johannson. When these two look in each other's eye's, it is the most sensuous sight imaginable.",8,1,2,29 September 2003
Spider-Man," A Superhero With Heart And Soul
","On the surface Sam Raimi's new film adaptation of the 1960's Marvel comic book SPIDER-MAN shares all the ( by now ) familiar elements of your standard , big screen Superhero movie : up-dated surroundings to give the story an identifiable , contemporary look that young audiences can relate to ; a fairly straightforward re-telling of the original source peppered with a few hip 'in-jokes' to give the movie a 'coolness' quotient ; and last but not least a dozen or so nifty special effects sequences to make the movie worth the price of admission. SPIDER-MAN possesses all these things but it has that little extra something going for it that places it on a higher pedestal than most of the generic action hero adventures of the past.As with 1978's SUPERMAN , the new film has a very likable hero who has two distinct personalities : the nerdy , unassuming good guy in ordinary , everyday life and the transformed , nearly invincible righter of wrongs. It also shares with 1989's BATMAN a colorful , creepy nemesis who hangs out in a Gothic-type mansion and battles the hero in a rousing fight -to-the death finale. SUPERMAN benefited from Christopher Reeve's affable portrayal in the title role , while BATMAN boasted Jack Nicholson's scene -stealing turn as the evil Joker.SPIDER-MAN is blessed with two wonderful actors who infuse the movie with a rare sense of humanity atypical of the genre. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker , the introverted Queens high school student who gets bitten by a 'new' species of spider during a science class field trip. Kind-hearted and sensitive, he is the butt of jokes and an easy target of classroom bullies. He silently pines for the pretty girl next door , who happens to be the love interest of the chief bully. When young Parker is bitten by the runaway spider , he goes through a strange metamorphosis that dramatically alters his life. In the movie's greatest scenes, an expert series of sequences depicting Parker's transformation from intimidated weakling to a force to be reckoned with, director Raimi and his film technicians pull out all the stops. When Parker sits down at his bedroom desk and takes pencil to paper to design a makeshift costume to wear for a wrestling match , the fusion of cinematography , graphics, sound and a mesmerizing music score add up to commercial movie making at its best. The icing on the cake, however , is the unexpected power of Maguire's performance. A veteran of some of the finest American movies of the past several years , including THE ICE STORM and PLEASANTVILLE , Maguire on the surface can seem to be very bland. One of the very few screen actors who doesn't announce his presence with a huge chip on his shoulder, his seemingly placid exterior is deceptive. When Parker suddenly finds a loved one in grave peril , the emotion that Maguire summons up catches the audience off guard. With tears welling in his eyes and a look of stunned grief that in a flash turns to anger, this remarkable young actor raises this action/adventure fantasy to a higher level.The other standout performance is given by Willem Dafoe as Spider-man's adversary , the enterprising scientist Norman Osborne whose evil incarnation into The Green Goblin dominates much of the second ( and weaker ) half of the picture. Because Dafoe is such a strong actor and a tremendous screen presence, he is able to tide the movie over the more conventional story-telling elements that dominate the film's final hour. Dafoe really doesn't offer anything new here , but he is so adept at personifying evil that this viewer finds him compulsively watchable. He may want to reconsider playing this type of role in the future. With his gargoyle-like countenance Dafoe is a popular choice for off-beat roles, especially villains ; however , he is an actor of brilliant diversity and has played everything from the poet T.S. Eliot to Jesus.The enormous success of SPIDER-MAN assures a series of sequels in the up-coming years. Maguire has already signed on for the next production , which certainly can't hurt. But lightning rarely strikes twice, and no matter how good or financially lucrative the next movie might be , I doubt it will have the nascent power that makes the present SPIDER-MAN so distinctive.",9,0,1,8 November 2002
Pearl Harbor," Faux Epic
","The Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production PEARL HARBOR is one of the great missed opportunities in the history of American movies. A year before the film's May 25, 2001 opening theater audiences were teased with a series of impressive trailers highlighting spectacular action sequences from the 135 million dollar production. Advance poster art for the film displayed handsome visages of the three main stars with vintage military aircraft flying in the background. Could it be that Michael Bay, the director of such mindless crash and burn spectaculars as THE ROCK and Armageddon , had acquired a gift for epic storytelling? James Cameron, another filmmaker noted more for technical know-how than with a gift for the pen had pulled it off a few years earlier with TITANIC , creating a hugely popular historical romance the likes of which had not been seen since DOCTOR ZHIVAGO and GONE WITH THE WIND. Alas, it was not to be. PEARL HARBOR emerged as an overblown , incredibly mediocre wartime romance. A box office sensation in its first 2 weeks of release , its numbers dwindled drastically as a result of lukewarm reviews and poor word-of mouth. The film seemed to gain a loyal following among the younger generations far removed from the events of December 7, 1941. But to World War 2 veterans and older members of the baby boom era, the picture was looked on as a travesty of history and a totally false depiction of the culture and its times. Randall Wallace's original screenplay had the quality of a sloppy first draft. The paint -by-numbers story of two childhood buddies who join the Airforce , fall in love with the same woman ( a gorgeous Army nurse, naturally! ) and go on to seemingly defend all of Pearl Harbor against the sudden Japanese attack is numbingly predictable. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett portray the two boyhood friends with great earnestness but they are crushed under the weight of a poorly written scenario.The lovely and talented Kate Beckinsale , the object of the boys' affections, is also wasted in an essentially generic role. In fact the entire supporting cast is one huge blur, everyone playing 'types' instead of flesh and blood people. The film's spectacular set piece, the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, is a tour De force of visual and sound effects (for which the movie deservedly won an Academy Award) but it can't save the second hand plot from sinking in its own commonplaceness. I wanted to like PEARL HARBOR. Making a movie , large or small can be an enormous task and it's amazing when a project is completed that fulfills even half of what the filmmakers intended. But the creators of PEARL HARBOR announced the importance of their brainchild early on , and the critics were armed on opening day.In this case the critics were right. PEARL HARBOR is the frivolous product of a costly, uninspired imagination.",3,0,1,6 January 2003
Gone with the Wind," The One And Only
","It's the yardstick by which all other film epics are judged, and after 65 years 'Gone With The Wind' still remains Hollywood's most fully realized super production, a brilliant one-of-a-kind meeting of perfect casting, great acting, superb direction (by a number of hands), magnificently photographed Technicolor tableau and possibly the most romantic music score ever composed for a movie. Sidney Howard's screen adaptation expertly distilled Margaret Mitchell's rambling, compulsively readable novel into a concise 3 hour, 40 minute running time that amazingly captured all of the novel's dramatic high points. 'Gone with The Wind' is obviously the reel version of the American Civil War as opposed to the real thing but as entertainment it is an unparalleled achievement in cinematic storytelling. Since its release in 1939 very few films of its kind have matched it in sweep and spectacle.'Gone with The Wind' does show its age : its special effects look downright quaint to 21st century eyes but in its inexorable depiction of a particular American War and Peace it is unforgettable.",10,2,3,8 June 2004
Seabiscuit," The Book Wins By A Mile
","The experience of reading Laura Hillenbrand's SEABISCUIT is one of those rare instances where the right author and subject converge to give the mass readership an unforgettable interpretation of a famous historical character and the events that surrounded his life. The fact that the main protagonist is a diminutive Thoroughbred race horse whose nascent racing career was nearly ended by trainers who misunderstood the beast, and the resulting triumph of that beleaguered animal and his human cohorts who brought him to glory makes this Depression Era Saga all the more compelling. Hillenbrand's great narrative gift was to immerse the reader in another time and place, in this case the gritty, vivid world of America's Depression years. Spanning the entire decade of the 1930's, this true tale of a 'little horse that could' becomes much more than just another horse story.SEABISCUIT is really an Epic, covering the sweeping changes in the transportation industry as well as the dramatic events that shaped the first half of the Twentieth Century in America. How those industrial changes and social events are tied to the main characters in Hillenbrand's story makes for indelible reading.SEABISCUIT has a narrative drive and epic sweep not unlike Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND.In transferring this modern American Classic to the to the screen, director Gary Ross took on a daunting task. As Hillenbrand wrote it, the book covers an awful lot of ground. It starts with a young man on a train trip West with 21 cents in his pocket and ends 44 years later in the high country of California. It is peopled with unforgettable characters: Charles Howard , a former bicycle repair man who became an enormously wealthy automobile dealer ; his beloved second wife, Marcela, who turned Howard's life around after a family tragedy and became a savvy business partner in her own right ; Red Pollard, a down and out jockey who traveled the amateur racing circuit looking for his big break ; Tom Smith, a taciturn, tight-lipped horse trainer who had a secret communication with the equine world ; and George Woolf, the colorful, dashing jockey who raced into the History BooksThe movie of SEABISCUIT is a horse of a very different color. Director Garry Ross has made a staid and stately film of Hillenbrand's book. Technically the movie is very impressive, with its beautifully composed panoramic shots, authentic sets and costumes. The acting by the main principals is hard to fault. Tobey Maguire, a master of understatement, does some real stretching here ; his Red Pollard is a scrappy, moving performance. Chris Cooper offers a more amiable take on the Tom Smith character.Jeff Bridges plays Charles Howard with a sad eyed countenance. As for Seabiscuit , whatever alchemy created this equine character for the screen, it's a great portrayal. The nag is captured in all his moods, from stubborn and rebellious to cunning and victorious. Unfortunately, Ross's film is terribly disappointing. As impressive as the picture is in its physical recreation of the times, it trips up in what should be its most important element : the screenplay. The dialog spoken by the main characters is reduced to cliché ridden bromides. It's understandable that certain dramatic licenses are taken to make a filmed story work dramatically, but in this case there doesn't seem to be the 'ring of truth' to the verbal exchanges. As a result it undermines the movie's authenticity and what emerges is a larger than life historical pageant that only occasionally moves and thrills. Nevertheless, SEABISCUIT does offer a glimpse into the American Past. It's an earnest and honorable effort but It's no substitute for Laura Hillenbrand's saga, a story teeming with the sights and sounds of The Depression and Thoroughbrd Racing on every page. And that is the great difference. The movie has no life of its own.",6,0,0,13 August 2003
Call Me by Your Name," Love Seized , Lost and Remembered
","Director Luca Guadagnino and James Ivory as scenarist have fashioned a luxurious, sultry and intoxicatingly romantic film from Andre Aciman's novel, Call Me By Your Name. And in the process of adapting this bittersweet story of gay love the filmmakers have improved on an often beautifully written novel that tends to ramble with its first person narrative, punctuated by vivid descriptions of the Italian land and seascapes it wallows in , often to the sensual delight of the reader. As he did with the equally colorful , Italy -based romantic drama of 'I Am Love' (2009), Guadagnino paints with robust, sometimes subtle cinematic brushstrokes to bring forth an evocative atmosphere of heat, sun, flora and fruit as vivid background to the main story at hand.What is it about the best Italian film directors whose penchant for telling stories is so entwined with production values that dazzle the eye, be it in black and white our color? Luchino Visconti, Frederico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni , Bernardo Bertolucci and Franco Zeffirelli all had this gift, and it is readily apparent that the torch has been passed on to Luca Guadagnino. Abetted by the brilliant acting of Timothee Chalamet, Michael Stuhlberg and the impossibly handsome and able Armie Hammer, Call Me By Your Name emerges as an unforgettable, erotic and deeply moving saga of love found, lost and remembered.",10,1,2,22 January 2018
8 Mile," Stuck In Detroit
","To anyone over 30 and not familiar with rap music and its culture, watching Curtis Hanson's 8 MILE is bound to be a rather distancing experience. But given an open mind and the willingness to accept the movie on its own terms, this semi-fictional account of white rapper Eminem's nascent rise to fame has its rewards. That it's your basic 'A Star is Born' story coupled with references to past 'troubled youth' movies (the films of James Dean come to mind) makes the movie quite accessible to older audiences. Shorn of its profane language (there's a lot of it)and obligatory sex scenes, 8 MILE is a rather unremarkable tale of a young man's desire to escape the confines of work and life in downtown Detroit for a better life as a successful recording artist.At every turn Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith is confronted by stumbling blocks, be they domestic (his 'trailer trash' mom is dating one of his former high school chums), work related (he's not on good terms with the boss at the auto pressing plant), or social (he's an outsider, being a white rapper in a Black rappers' world.) The world of contemporary Detroit, circa 1995, dominates this movie as much as Eminem's star performance. Eminem (real name, Marshall Mathers, for the uninformed) portray's a version of himself here - a kinder, gentler version. His Rabbit, for all the swearing and incendiary rap lyrics, is deep down a sweet natured fellow given to occasional outbursts of angry frustration, understandable considering what he has to deal with. As with 'Rocky', another movie that vaguely resembles this new film, 8 MILE gets a lot of mileage out of pitting our hero against seemingly unbeatable odds . The city of Detroit, depicted here in all it's paint-peeling austerity by noted cinematographer Rodrigo Priesto, would give anyone pause. This kid's triumph over adversity makes for a fairly absorbing film experience, but aside from it's distinction as Eminem's fist big movie, the overall impression is one of numbing deja vu. What gives the project distinction is Eminem's very appealing performance. Under the expert guidance of director Hanson, Eminem proves to be a magnetic screen personality. Not a natural actor, he does come blazingly alive when he's in his own element. The rap music sequences are compulsively watchable, even though the uninitiated may weary of them after awhile.Dramatic scenes involving Rabbit's mom (played in convincing, frowzy fashion by the usually gorgeous Kim Basinger) are realistically put forth, and there is able support by other cast members, particularly Mekhi Phifer as a rap club owner and Tarryn Manning, striking in the brief role of Rabbit's ex girlfriend.Unlike most of Mr. Hanson's previous films, 8 MILE lacks the narrative drive that made L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE RIVER WILD so distinctive. For all its kitchen sink drama and stabs at realism, it emerges as only a middling achievement.",6,0,1,14 April 2003
Titanic," JAMES CAMERON'S HOMAGE TO SELZNICK AND LEAN
","Jame's Cameron's 'Titanic' struck a chord with movie goers of all ages for one simple reason : it moved. As corny and implausible as the screenplay is, Cameron nevertheless seamlessly weaved historical fact with soap opera fiction to create a movie that hearkened back to Hollywood's Golden Age. Is 'Titanic' the equal of 'Gone With The Wind'? Not by several knots. But it is a monumental production by any standards and in 1997 was the most sensational thing to come down the pike since the glory days of David O. Selznick  and David Lean. 'Titanic' is a grand, immensely entertaining extravaganza.",Null,3,5,26 October 2003
Mystic River," Eastwood's Imperfect But Powerful Tragedy
","'Mystic River' is a film of vaulting ambition and director Clint Eastwood's brave attempt to make a great American Tragedy in a style not unlike Theodore Dreiser's fateful novels or Italian director Luchino Visconti's calamitous domestic dramas. That he partially succeeds is due in great part to a magnificent ensemble cast, a methodical, old fashioned deliberateness in the storytelling and a haunting music score (composed by Eastwood) that reverberates throughout the film like a memento of past sins and regrets.Unfortunately  'Mystic River' falls far short  of greatness. Brian Helgeland's screenplay, based on Denis Lehane's compulsively readable crime novel, preserves the fascinating domestic drama but also retains much of the pedestrian dialogue that made the book little more than pulp fiction of a very average sort. The story of three boyhood friends whose lives are forever intertwined by a traumatic childhood incident  becomes a seemingly endless maze where the history of two working class Boston families are enmeshed in crimes of the past that echo into the present and inevitably  the future. The great American playwright Eugene O'Neill was a master at dramatizing a particular family drama wherein  his characters wore the past like a millstone around their necks. Clint Eastwood does the same thing here on an almost grander scale.Where the movie trumps -up is in the trite exchange between characters, particularly in scenes involving a murder investigation and conversations between a distraught husband and wife. The faults of the novel are repeated  to some degree in the film.That being said, there is much to admire here. The performances by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney are brilliant .  Kevin Bacon  does an admirable job with a rather hamstrung role as a cop assigned to a murder case. His scenes with Laurence Fishburne (another superb performance) are well acted but  undermined by  'Dragnet'-like dialogue that clashes with the more sobering domestic drama. Eastwood's deliberate pacing pays off at the finale. Much of the film is shot under gray skies and dimly lit nighttime scenes. A  patriotic parade under a bright noonday sun seems like a strange coda to end this film, until the camera pans across the murky Mystic River at  dusk , when all the power of this earnest but imperfect movie seems earned.",Null,0,0,12 January 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," A MEMORABLE MOCKINGBIRD
","Since its publication in 1960, Harper Lee's novel TO KILL  A MOCKINGBIRD has attained the status of  a classic work of American Literature , and rightfully so. Winner of the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction , it has become one of the most beloved books of all time ; indeed, one survey has claimed the book's popularity as being second only to The Bible !  However open to question those statistics are, there is no denying the charm and power of  Ms. Lee's  prose in telling a story of  the Depression Era South ( fictional Maycomb, a 'tired old town' in Alabama.) I first read the novel in the Spring of  '63, just prior to seeing the film version which was soon opening at  my home town's local movie theater. As  an impressionable 14 year old, I was hooked by the  book's Southern Gothic atmosphere, which seemed strangely alien to a middle class High School freshman living in upstate New York. As narrated in the first person by  Jean Louise Finch (nickname Scout) ,  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a remembrance of things past, at times humorous, often rueful and sometimes terrifying. It is also a memorial  to Scout's father Atticus Finch, a middle aged trial lawyer who defends a local black man accused of raping a white woman. Scout's reminiscences cover alot of territory, and it is Harper Lee's special gift to be able to give the reader a succinct but substantial history of  the Finch family tree, a short but important history of Maycomb County and its environs, and an evocative description of the Finch home and neighborhood surroundings. The  novel's greatest achievement is giving voice to childhood joys and fears as delivered through the mind's eye of the older Scout , who sounds like a sophisticated, female variation of Huckleberry Finn ; older, wiser but  possessing the charm, compassion and raillery of Twain's immortal character. And Lee's foray into Huck Finn territory is brilliantly displayed when Scout, her older brother Jem and friend Dill pursue the mystery of Boo Radley , a reclusive tenant who lives in the ramshackle house down the street. There's a bit of the Hardy Boys and  Penrod on display here coupled with unnerving suspense, and a hint of the dangers that lurk just outside the imagined safe world of childhood. In adapting MOCKINGBIRD to the screen, veteran playwright Horton Foote was faced with the unenviable task of trying to preserve as closely as possible the outline of Lee's novel and to recreate as many memorable scenes and characters that had captivated an enormous reading public. This is usually a Herculean task, and right from the outset  Foote started eliminating several  characters and incidents  in the book.  Gone was Atticus's judgmental but well-meaning sister , Scout's Aunt Alexandra ; childhood friend Dill's Aunt Rachel was transformed into Aunt Stephanie , a more eccentric character to no doubt provide a little comic relief ; and Atticus's amiable brother Jack, an M.D. A  striking sequence depicting a house fire was scratched, along with a memorable visit to Aunt Alexandra's house at Finch's Landing. What emerged on the screen was the basic story whittled down to it's most important elements :  Atticus's  decision to defend Tom Robinson , culminating in the trial itself ; and the childhood adventures of Scout, Jem and Dill and their obsession with the unseen Boo Radley. What is immediately obvious is that the film is not the book. There really is no substitute for Lee's indelible narrative. Scout's first person commentary is relegated to a few sparse musings, albeit expertly culled from the book.  Since the narrative voice of Scout is basically missing, the movie is guided along by a more conventional story, and incidents that happen to and are observed by Scout (the great , often riotous classroom scenes) are mentioned as off stage happenings. However, the movie is a significant achievement and memorable in its own way. Producer Alan Pakula (who went on to become a topflight director), director Robert Mulligan and Mr. Foote have been faithful to the novel's essence. The screenplay includes the major plot points and retains as much of the original dialogue between characters as is possible in a film running a little over two hours. The stroke of genius in the production lies in the casting. Gregory Peck IS Atticus Finch. Not only does he fit the part like a glove ; he brings tremendous nuance to the role. It's a brilliant performance, one that  speaks volumes even when the actor doesn't  say a word. The inspiration continues in the roles of Atticus's children, superbly played by Philip Alford as Jem and Mary Badham as Scout. Badham's performance is particularly memorable. She beautifully captures Scout's tomboyish nature while exhibiting the tender qualities needed for her scenes with Atticus. Indeed, some of the movie's most unforgettable moments consist of father and daughter alone together. A scene where Atticus lets Scout handle his pocketwatch is indescribably moving, as is the subsequent bedtime dialogue between sister and brother concerning their deceased mother. As long as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD stays rooted in the childrens' experience it remains a sublime entertainment. Unfortunately it hits a rough patch  about halfway through when it comes to the trial scene, a crucial part of the story, but one the nearly undermines the steady filmic narrative that has gone before. In the novel Tom Robinson's trial is seen through Scout's literary eyes and ears. In the movie that voice is missing and we see Scout  as part of the crowd in the balcony above, only when the camera decides to focus in that direction. As well acted as the trial sequence is, as beautifully as Gregory Peck conveys the earnestness and acuity of a smalltown defense attorney trying to save one man's life, the trial sequence stops the film dead in its tracks. Lasting a half hour in screen time , it is the film's one major caveat. And yet it is hard to figure what would have worked better. So much pertinent information is given here, the inherent prejudices of the townspeople , the underlying behavior of the witnesses on the stand : all crucial material.  Once the trial ends the movie quickly gets back on its feet and as it draws towards its conclusion it becomes an unforgettable experience. One of the most beautifully lyrical and frightening scenes ever filmed is Scout and Jem's fateful nightime journey home through the woods. In a forest  right out of Hansel and Gretel , the two children take their precarious steps in a moonlit shadowy landscape that rivals anything done by the great black and white cinematographers of the Silent Era. And then there is that magnificent ending, which I defy even the most hardened viewer not to feel a lump in the throat. When  Mary Badham walks down that sidewalk for the last time on her way home,accompanied by composer Elmer Bernstein's  haunting music score, you realize what kind of greatness motion pictures can achieve.",Null,1,2,16 March 2003
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The One That Started It All
","Here is where it all started. This landmark film, the very first full length animated feature, belongs on the short list of the most influential American movies of the Twentieth Century. If Mickey Mouse was the rock on which the House of Disney was built, then SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS was the cement that helped form the Disney conglomerate as we know it today.Rudimentary by today's standards, SNOW WHITE nevertheless remains a masterpiece of animation because it possesses two qualities totally lacking in most of today's computerized works : Heart and Soul. Despite the advancement in technology, regardless of the magic of pixels and virtual imagery, most present-day animated features lack basic storytelling skills, relying rather on the easy clever remark and an annoying tendency to preach than tell a good tale. And nothing can compare to the inspired and solid craftsmanship of Disney's original 'old man 'team of animators who bravely learned their trade while creating this nascent work of art. SNOW WHITE is the cornerstone of all of Walt Disney's greatest animated films : an involving story, characters the audience can care for and identify with, superbly drawn animation put into brilliant motion and heightened by the innovative use of the then revolutionary multi-plane camera ( a device that dramatically changed the look of cartoons, giving scenes a third dimensional look). Added to all these innovations were the remarkable songwriting contributions of Frank Churchill and Leigh Harline, responsible for the superb musical score.'Someday My Prince Will Come', Heigh Ho' and 'Whistle While You Work' are just three examples of an entire soundtrack that is a model of perfection and to this day one of the great movie song scores of all time. One could go on and remark on the incredible detail afforded the dwarfs' home, the wood sculpturing that adorns everything from the little mens' beds to stair-posts and doorknobs.The detail is astonishing, and the blood and sweat of the animators' labors will forever be enshrined in this lasting work of art.",10,2,3,6 February 2003
Ben-Hur," Big Ben
","When one thinks of the word 'epic' in regard to movies, certain titles automatically come to mind : perhaps the most popular pick among the mass movie-going public would be GONE WITH THE WIND; but I think there is one picture that truly stands out - it may not be the biggest or even the best, but the elements that define the genre are so identified with this film that the title alone has become a moniker for epic movie-making . I'm referring to William Wyler's 1959 re-make of MGM's original silent, BEN HUR. Back in the early 20s the silent BEN was fraught with countless production mishaps that plagued the then merging Goldwyn and Metro Companies but the problems were vindicated when the spectacular production finally opened in 1925. The movie's centerpiece was a thrilling chariot race sequence that purportedly half of Hollywood's population took part in as extras. Done in the standard florid style of the silent era, the picture was the last word in spectacle for its time; fast-forward to 1959 when a desperate MGM was counting on the new production to save the company from financial disaster. The new version did just that, receiving nearly unanimous critical praise and enormous receipts at the box office. There are several reasons why BEN HUR was such a success. The obvious reasons are all there (great story of former boyhood friendship and later bitter enemies leading to a classic tale of revenge; the requisite big set pieces, costumes and a chariot race to end all chariot races ; it tops the silent classic and remains to this day as perhaps the greatest action sequence ever filmed). There is another key to the film's popularity and that is Miklos Rozsa's monumental music score. Is it great music? Highbrows would probably beg to differ, but has there ever been a movie that punctuated nearly every scene with as much portent and exposition? The music is a virtual stew of borrowed styles that seems to be conducted by a Divine Hand ( a soothing lullaby of voices accompanies the Star of Bethlehem as it hovers over the Manger in the pre-title Nativity sequence; the Christ's hand offers BEN a sorely needed ladle of water to strains of a Heavenly Wurlitzer and the announcement that lepers are present gets a huge boost from a heavy laden brass accompaniment). This is program music, maybe not of the highest order but incredibly effective. To sum up , BEN HUR has it all, including a pretty unsubtle homo-erotic spin on the relationship between Ben and Messala ( thanks to uncredited scenarist Gore Vidal. )",10,1,2,26 May 2002
Signs," Cosmic Claptrap
","M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is one of the most remarkable displays of sheer craftsmanship triumphing over vacuous material that I have seen in years. A former minister turned farmer who has recently lost his wife in a grisly car accident wakes up to find his Pennsylvania cornfield bedecked with a trio of huge crop circles, the husks flattened as if by an imaginary , unseen giant. As Graham Hess ( Mel Gibson ) and his younger brother and two children look on , trying to fathom what has caused this phenomenon, director Shyamalan very cleverly wraps the audience around his cinematic green thumb : questions abound - have aliens invaded the Hess property , or have a local gang of troublesome goons decided to wreak havoc on this good man's family? And what about the eerie sounds being picked up by a seemingly ordinary baby monitor? At other times porch chimes clink in a mad cacophony of sound and a child's swing set moves erratically, not by a sudden breeze but a menacing presence that has just slipped into that cornfield beyond. All this is orchestrated by a master film technician having great fun keeping the viewer on the edge of his seat. When the film starts to get heavy with portentous signs of Armageddon ( alien spacecraft are seen hovering over major cities of the world , compliments of a CNN -like newscast ) , Shyamalan leavens the mood with unexpected, goofy moments of humor ( brother Merrill becomes a manic t.v. news junkie, the two kids don homemade aluminum foil hats that look like giant Hershey Kisses .) As the film draws toward its by now not very surprising conclusion, one is amazed out how this incredibly talented young filmmaker has milked a plot so devoid of substance and yet has made a movie that is by and large a riveting experience. He borrows shamelessly from Hitchcock (check out those elegant opening credits and James Newton Howard's magnetic, Bernard Herrmann influenced score ) but he also has his own very definite strengths. Aside from a brilliant mastery of editing and sound design , Shyamalan knows how to bring out the best in actors. Mel Gibson gives his most relaxed and appealing performance in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix displays an immensely likable, goofy charm as the brother and last but not least, the two kids are terrific. Rory Culkin , so good in YOU CAN COUNT ON ME , has a precocious flippancy that provides much needed humor and Abigail Breslin as his younger sister Bo is absolutely adorable; both children emerge as real kids, no small achievement. As to what lurks in those mysterious cornfields, I'll leave that to the uninitiated. The cornfields may be hollow, and you may feel that you've been had by film's end , but M. Night Shyamalan is a ingenious huckster who has you believing while you're watching his teasing, thorny thicket of a movie.",Null,0,2,3 September 2002
The Deer Hunter," The Seeds of Destruction
","For all its faults (and there are many), Michael Cimino's Vietnam war saga THE DEER HUNTER is a movie that leaves a lasting impression. The story of three steel mill workers who leave family and friends to go fight in Vietnam, become embroiled in the horrors of war and return to their Pennsylvania hometown in varying states of mental and physical breakdown seems more powerful now than when it first premiered in 1978. Perhaps the film's greatest strength is its uncanny ability to convey the everyday milieu of fictional Clairton, Pa. ; its depiction of blue collar workers, most of Russian descent who are closely tied to family and cultural tradition, who unswervingly believe in God and Country, may not appeal to the more Liberal audience. Indeed, the movie was castigated by many Vietnam Veterans as a false depiction of the times, a simple minded multimillion dollar action flick that reduced the Vietnam Conflict to a John Wayne -type polemic with nary a peace sign in sight. Director Cimino had always claimed that his film was a story of how war effects the ordinary man ; the fact that it took place in the Vietnam Era was incidental. With unstinting mastery Michael Cimino guides the viewer on a lengthy journey into the heart of darkness that was Vietnam ; how it broke the spirit of its fighting men and the devastating consequences the war had on those men when they returned home. THE DEER HUNTER is not a casebook study. It plays fast and loose with the facts, nowhere more apparent than in the horrific Russian Roulette sequences that dominate the middle and final third of the picture. These scenes , the first of which is set in a prisoner of war camp, are among the most harrowing ever filmed. As a display of action , violence and unbearable tension, it is a stupendous piece of film-making ; it is also cunningly manipulative. For a movie that covers such a large narrative canvas it is remarkable how the pace almost never flags. But THE DEER HUNTER does have an Achilles heel , and it is a serious one. With a screenplay by Derek Washburn and story contributions by Cimino and two other writers, the film is an incoherent mess. Dialogue tends toward the fragmented and clearly thought -out sentences are discarded when the trite and obvious will do. What goes a long way in saving the picture from disaster, in fact miraculously lifts the movie to another realm is the director's astonishing technical mastery. The great tragedy of Michael Cimino's career was that he was never able to speak as eloquently as he was able to visualize. He got away with it in THE DEER HUNTER because his crudely spoken story was enveloped in some of the most most atmospherically drenched, scenically stunning widescreen cinematography ever put on film. From the dark cavernous interior of an enormous Russian Orthodox Church to the outlying depressed steel mill town and the majestic snow covered mountains that surround it; the verdant greens of Vietnam and the blast of orange fire killing everything in its path; and the smoky, hellish interior behind a Saigon storefront, where the stakes are high and a friend's life lies in the balance. Adding immeasurably to the film's power is a superb cast, headed by Robert DeNiro as Michael, whose 'one shot ' code of ethics used in hunting deer becomes a metaphor for the entire movie. Also impressive are John Savage as a boyish bridegroom , John Cazale as a hot-headed drinking buddy and Meryl Streep as the girl who's left behind. But the most unforgettable performance is given by Christopher Walken who plays Nick, Michael's loyal, sensitive friend and hunting partner who becomes lost in the murk and mire of Vietnam. Walken 's portrait of a man scarred by life with eyes that seem half -dead will haunt you. The critical and popular success of THE DEER HUNTER emboldened Cimino to try his hand with an even bigger project for his next movie. But implanted in THE DEER HUNTER were the future seeds of destruction. HEAVEN'S GATE, released in 1980, was Michael Cimino's epic western of Wyoming's infamous Johnson County War. The new film had all the elements that distinguished THE DEER HUNTER : brilliant pictorial composition, stunning locales and riveting action sequences. It also had an unintelligible screenplay, one so inept that no amount of technical resources could hide it. A fine cast was lost in a sea of unfocused characterizations and unclear motivations. The result was an unqualified disaster that brought down a studio (United Artists) and stalled a promising career. Michael Cimino had an unparalleled gift for visual composition equaled perhaps only by David Lean and a few others. HEAVEN'S GATE is worth a look just for that fact alone. Profligate film-making is what got Michael Cimino in the end. But he is without doubt a born film director, and with THE DEER HUNTER he reached boldly, if perhaps imperfectly, for greatness.",8,0,0,6 April 2003
