The Ring," A Great Horror Film After All These Years
","A few Days ago i watched rings which was release this years after 12 years since the ring 2 and i really struggled a lot while watching it, anyway after finishing it i went back and watch the ring (the original) which was released back in 2002 and i discovered immediately why i didn't like the new one.Even this film was originally a remake for the Japanese version (Ringu 1998)it has it's own magic ( The Hollywood magic) which is the way of shooting the film a long side the special effects that no other one can due till this date. Naomi Watts delivered one of her best performance to the big screen she really gave us all the emotions of a women who is more scared of her son's life than hers, even though she is going to die before him! And the best thing that saved this film and made it a successful hit in 2002 is the story line which shows you each day what's going on with the character's life till the final day, which made it superior to the sequel and the remake.",7,8,9,29 June 2017
Interstellar," Gravity is still the best sci-Fic of all time
","first of all i'm happy that the film wasn't number one at the box office and that's for a simple reason it didn't deserve it. I went last Friday to see this film for two reasons : first i like Nolan's films specially Inspection, and second reason is because i thought i'm gonna see a film like or even better than Gravity, but it wasn't. as the matter of fact it was the worst film i have ever seen for years and that's for many reasons: 1- the graphic design was OK, but not like Gravity gravity was much real as if u were in the space with them 2-the story is very long unreasonable ( specially the end) and confusing because once u are in space and once u are in earth i really wanted to leave the theater but i because i paid the ticket i refused to go out. and i the end all i wanted is to( get my money back )",1,15,30,10 November 2014
Flight," I Saw It For Three Times In One Week
","If the star of the movie is Denzel Washington and the director is ( Robert Zemeckis ) who directed legend films such as (Forrest Gump 1994, What Lies Beneath 2000, Back to the Future trilogy), so the result will be fantasticI was really afraid before going to the cinema cause i thought it is the same story about flights, but wan't trust me the film is excellent, the whole crew were marvelous at their Patrs, and Denzel Washington gave us his finest role he had ever done.I went for the same movie three times just to see Denzel Washington performance, and for those who want to be a great actors have to see Denzel Washington performance over and over again he convinced you from the beginning of the movie till the endi hope he gets the Oscar for this year, but I think her will lose it for Daniel Day-Lewis in (Lincoln)",9,6,10,10 January 2013
Joy," So Underrated
","probably one of the best films of 2015 Miss, Lawrence delivered one of her most powerful performance to the screen, and even though she won an Oscar for (Silver Linings Playbook 2012) her performance here is much more powerful. she bring a very hard combination of both comedy and tragedy that no other actress can bring to the screen, and i must give a big thanks to David O. Russell who gave Jennifer three Academy Award nomination for three movie they worked together ( SLP 2012, AH 2013, and this film).There're so many critics criticized the film by saying that all the rest of the cast are so weak or unnecessary and any other unknown actors could do there job, which i totally disagree with. yes the role of other actors are not as the size of Joy's role and that's for a reason ( because she is the center of the whole story), but all of them give a brilliant job. Robert De Niro was amazing in his small role and gave us a couple of funny scenes such as the wedding, and the fighting scene between him and Virginia Madsen ( his ex- wife) which also was so good and funny even though most of her scenes were made in one room the bedroom.Also the grandmother role (Diane Ladd ) which also was the narrator of the whole film was very powerful to the whole film, because she was the the person who encouraged joy to become a important person in this world.",8,26,43,10 May 2017
