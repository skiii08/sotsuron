","Just wanted to see the movie for the high rating on IMDb but was totally disappointed!! It's not worth spending 93 minutes on the sofa, should have seen anything else actually, a bit ruined Saturday evening. This movie reminded me a bit of one van Damme's movies from the 90's - Timecop, and not in a good way! It's was too complicated at the beginning, and to predictable for the next hour, I got bored already in the second time our hero got back to train and the movie didn't get my full attention during all of the 93 minutes, I drank couple of vodka&tonic cocktails, had some pancakes with maple syrup and was waiting for the final titles to show up quicker. Sorry guys - only 4 stars from me, two for the acting of Gyllenhaal, one for the explosions one for that the movie wasn't 2 hours long!",4,0,5,24 July 2011
