The Equalizer," Denzel delivers the goods
","Denzel Washington delivers as ex CIA operative Robert McCall who routinely goes about his business in downtown Boston - with a little OCD thrown in for good measure. Robert promised his recently deceased wife that he would move on from his former life and that was all going well until he befriends Teri/Alina (a very underused Chloe Moretz) who is on the receiving end of some harsh treatment from her Russian pimp. Now this is an action movie - it isn't pretending to be anything else - so don't go in expecting some deep and meaningful character development scenarios. This is Denzel handing out justice in his own way, as Robert McCall decides to help Chloe out by taking out the local Russian Mafia (after trying to buy Alina's freedom). This doesn't sit well with the Russians and soon Teddy (Marton Csokas) arrives to try to figure out what went wrong.From this point in your belief needs to be subdued a bit as Robert appears to always be one step ahead of Teddy and his band of local goons - including the clich√©d 'dirty cops'. Even though the movie has a number of action checkpoints we the viewer need to pass (show me an action movie that doesn't) I found myself buckled in for the ride.What I think could hurt this movie is the fact that Denzel is teaming up with 'Training Day' director Antoine Fuqua - and we all know that was a successful partnership back in 2001. My advice - be prepared to suspend a little bit of belief and just sit back and enjoy the ride and who knows maybe Robert might be back to help someone else.",7,2,5,13 October 2014
Gone Girl," Do we really fully know anyone?
","Fincher is back after a three year hiatus since 'Girl With a Dragon Tattoo' and for me the wait was worth it. This time around he has adapted Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel of the same name (which I haven't read) and from all reports the movie sticks pretty close to the novel - probably due to the fact that Flynn herself wrote the screenplay.The film follows the once loved up couple of Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who both lost their jobs in a recent recession and have had to move back to his hometown, where, using Amy's money Nick owns and runs a bar with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon). It is their fifth wedding anniversary and it is fair to say this is one relationship that has come to end of the road. After a call from a friendly neighbour about his cat (which he shows more affection to than his wife), Nick returns home and discovers that something is a miss - namely Amy is missing.The rest of the movie revolves around the 'media' witch hunt surrounding number one suspect Nick and Nick's quest to clear his name. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) does her best to crack the case while Nick himself has the help of well known lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). The two and half hour run time seemed to fly by and the film doesn't quite follow the same path as most thrillers with some unexpected twists and turns, which is always pleasing to see, and an ending that may disappoint some cinema goers, but from what I understand stays pretty true to the book.",9,5,15,11 October 2014
