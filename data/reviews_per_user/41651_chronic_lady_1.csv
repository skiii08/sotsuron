The Devil's Advocate," Wonderful Piece of Hell
","I must say, at first I never really wanted to see the movie after it got some pretty bad reviews, however, after going through the Keanu Reeves syndrome, I decided to watch this film, and I was glad that I did. Amongst all the characters, I was mostly pleased with Al Pacino's performance, as not only he plays a vicious role, but also his humorous comments were brilliant. Keanu's performance however was mediocre, I thought he could do better. As for Charlize Theron, as this was one of her first films, I think she did a very good job of playing such a serious role at the age of 22. This is a great thriller, and I recommend you watch it. 10/10",10,4,5,28 May 2010
