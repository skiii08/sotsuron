The Lobster," Disappointing
","In the last few days I have watched Olympus has fallen, Me, Earl and the dying girl, and The Lobster. I thought The Lobster the weakest of the three. Does this show that I prefer blockbusters and indie movies to high concept art-house? Not at all, if anything the opposite is true. But I thought the first two were excellent contributions to their genres, firing on all cylinders, while the third underperformed. The Lobster has a terrific cast and it is beautifully filmed with lovely music - though I could have done with less of the staccato Shostakovich. But a film like this needs intellectual clout and the idea driving The Lobster is thin. It simply doesn't sustain a two hour movie, and by deliberately presenting its characters as emotionally distanced, the film denies itself the chance to engage your heart as well as your head. In comparison with a film like Never let me go it is a cold and empty experience. It is beautiful to watch and occasionally funny but that's not enough.",5,2,7,17 March 2016
Spartacus," One of the most intelligent and moving of the epics
","There are of course flaws in this film and they are detailed in other reviews. Some of the exposition is leaden, the women have ridiculously elaborate hair styles, and the dialogue at times is weak. There is a sentimental streak, though it's nowhere near as intrusive as a Spielberg version would be. But its excellent qualities more than make up for this. First the acting. The slaves are not that impressive but the Romans more than make up for it - the Brits Olivier, Laughton and Ustinov make a phenomenal team. Then the action sequences, brilliantly staged and among the best ever filmed. Most important, though, is the handling of the story which manages to be equally moving and thought-provoking. We know hardly anything about the Third Servile War and nothing at all about Spartacus's character and motivations. The overtly Marxist take on the revolt is, well, as convincing as any (freedom for all blah blah) but the way it is woven in with the politics of the day is brilliant. For my money this is the best of all the epics - more consistent than El Cid or Ben Hur, which have dated much more. Incidentally, the novel on which the movie is based, Howard Fast's Spartacus, is awfully heavy going, and I admire the way the script writer Dalton Trumbo gave it the necessary tension and momentum. The music too is excellent and the direction, well, it's mainly Kubrick so enough said.",8,1,3,17 January 2015
The English Patient," Lyrical romance fails to show its age ... as yet
","Twenty years on this film shows no sign of aging, undoubtedly helped by its historical setting (as we know, nothing dates faster than clothing and interiors). I think it gets nearly everything right. The cast is magnificent, the narrative approach highly effective, the cinematography and direction outstanding. The script is so intelligent - much could be said about the multiple examples of symmetry and contrast, between individuals, present and past, circumstances etc. One reason all the cast deliver such terrific performances is that they are given wonderful material to work with, as characters they are all fully fleshed out and convincing. To me it bears comparison with the epics of David Lean. I only have two criticisms and neither amounts to much. One is that, OK, it is sentimental, but I don't find it excessively so. The later cave of swimmers scenes are so moving! I love them. The second criticism is that there are various implausibilities, like Fiennes being able to make his way from a train track in the middle of nowhere to the place where the plane is held. And I don't think the characters would bump into each other quite as much as they do. Minor quibbles when you think of the sweep and scale of the movie, the intelligence, the warmth of the relationships and the immaculate use of the African and Italian settings.",8,0,0,16 August 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," Terrific special effects blockbuster
","Yes, yes, it's implausible, and sentimental at times, but this is a heck of an exciting movie. From the very first scene its momentum is so strong that even though I know exactly what is coming, there are at least half a dozen points when I marvel at the way Emmerich delivers the thrills. Los Angeles destroyed by a tornado, the crashing helicopters, the wave hitting New York, the wolves on the ship, the fall into the galleria, the sudden plunge in temperature. For edge of the seat excitement this movie is up there with Terminator and Aliens. I am surprised by the hostility of many reviews, especially those implying that it's dumbed down. Actually the script is intelligent and at times funny, and the relationships are touching. But it's the sheer visceral drive that continues to impress most. Forget the rubbish science and the corny politics, and just enjoy the ride.",9,1,2,19 March 2016
Alien," Why is it such a classic?
","After all, surely it is just a haunted house or lost platoon movie taken to the extreme? No, it's much more. In Alien everything works to best effect, and that was not simply luck. In Giger's astonishing alien, cold metallic smoothness is synergised with unmitigated, super-swift killing and intelligent cunning, representing an unprecedentedly fearsome enemy. The bickering relationships among the crew set up an atmosphere of unease and vulnerability that the malign intent of the Company readily exploits. And the descent into chaos and terror is orchestrated with devilish finesse through the brilliant coordination of lighting, music and adroit camera work. For me this is Scott's Citizen Kane - it all falls into place. It is his main claim to greatness.",9,2,4,17 January 2015
Bridge of Spies," An excellent character-driven movie about the Cold War
","This film ticked a lot of boxes for me. I am very fond of well-crafted spy movies, enjoy historical settings, love the acting of Mark Rylance and have a thing for intelligent screenplays. They are all here, plus Spielberg's renowned direction and a sterling performance by Tom Hanks in the lead role. The movie is doing well at the box office for which it can thank its bankable names and gripping main sequences - it's hard to go wrong with a high profile trial followed by a prisoner exchange, with some Cold War hysteria thrown in for good measure. All provide lots of tension without standing in the way of some very interesting character development. The relationship between Hanks and Rylance is really well managed. What great actors they both are: in their scenes together there is so much superb interaction in speech and body language. The New York and Berlin locations are exceptionally well recreated, a positive joy to watch. A lot of research, thought and professionalism have gone into this film. Some issues: not much material for the female lead to work with (blame that on the time setting), a bit of a sag in the transition between NYC and East Berlin, some clumsy humour (the so-called family and the delivery bikes in the corridor) and that trademark Spielberg sentimentality in the closing scenes. But these are minor blemishes on a film which should bring in a whole bunch of Oscars next spring.",9,1,3,5 December 2015
Doctor Zhivago," A classic of the big screen - and I mean big
","I saw a restored print of this classic this afternoon, complete with intermission. Fifty years after release it inevitably looks and sounds dated at times, though that is lessened by the historical setting. It demands to be watched in a cinema, without distractions and getting the full impact of Jarre's score. As others have commented, Lean managed to extract career best performances from Christie, Sharif, Courtenay and Steiger, which is quite something. The script by Robert Bolt struck me as less successful. At times he sums up quite complicated political points deftly and even memorably ('the personal life is dead in Russia'), but he manages more straightforward exchanges less competently than a TV soap scriptwriter would. Still, the impression this movie makes on the viewer remains powerful. There are so many brilliant set pieces and they are skilfully deployed by Lean, e.g. the two battle scenes during the partisan sequence are set in midwinter and midsummer, gaining the benefit of the visual contrast in the seasons while telling the viewer how long Zhivago is away from his family and Lara. And the WW1 sequence - which has to be done quickly - is nonetheless very strong. Yes it's sentimental but this is truly an amazing film, a great one despite its faults.",9,1,1,12 December 2015
Zulu," A total classic
","I have watched Zulu more times than I can count and know every line and camera shot. Put simply, everything came together in this movie, from the intelligent, sensitively written script, through the fine acting and camera work, to the outstanding score. It is a classic of the 60s, a miracle as the colour sergeant says at the end. With hindsight it's impossible to see quite how Endfield and Prebble came up with the project and then managed it so successfully, especially taking into account the difficulties of filming on location in apartheid SA. And filming in a burning building too was extremely risky. The film is fifty years old now and while it has obviously aged to some degree, its qualities remain extraordinary, as does its appearance - what colour! The only aspect that doesn't quite convince is the extent of the close combat. I would have thought that in close combat Zulu agility and dexterity with the assegai, plus their numbers, would have won through. I would expect the British to have held them at bay almost entirely with rifle fire. But the historical research was solid so I could be wrong.",10,6,6,18 April 2014
Gone Girl," Disappointing
","All reviews are subjective but I think it applies with especial force to this movie, and I can see why opinions are so polarised. If you are happy to leave your brain at the door and go along with the roller-coaster ride then you're in the right hands - a very skilled director and script writer, good actors and no expense spared in production. Start looking at the plot holes and the whole experience becomes risible - even for a thriller this one is totally over the top. That said, there are a number of specific reasons why I found this movie beyond annoying. One is the absence of emotional engagement on the part of the cast, because disengagement is part of the character of the two protagonists. The result is that the viewer looks forward to the appearance of the secondary characters, like Affleck's sister and the detective, simply because they offer a minimal amount of emotional input. A second issue is the long recapitulation of events narrated by Pike about a third of the way into the movie, which is basically telling viewers they've been fooled and stalls the action for, what, about ten minutes? Also incredible is the idea that a woman capable of such intricate and sustained planning could be hoodwinked by the trailer park villains - it was pure plot device. I could go on. Suffice it to say that this is the cinematic equivalent of a page turner, superficial in the extreme and really disappointing for fans of the director's movies.",1,1,9,23 April 2015
Prisoners," Thrilling but sombre
","I think you have to be in the right mood for this movie. It does have some rather protracted scenes and the various plot lines don't come together especially well. Jake Gyllenhaal's character is not given any hinterland which makes it very hard for him to make the role come alive. On the other hand, if you are in the frame of mind for a whole bunch of creepy haunted house sequences and prepared to tolerate some rather nasty scenes, then you may well enjoy the way it develops. It's grey toned and slow but packs a real punch at times, with some edge of your seat moments. Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but a worthwhile investment of your time. Interesting that it's set in Pennsylvania but was shot in Georgia.",8,1,2,17 January 2015
Woman in Gold," Dull and obvious
","This is not a bad movie, it is just an awfully tedious and oh so predictable one. Helen Mirren does her formidable best to bring her character to life but regrettably she simply has no material to work with and the performance is formulaic. The intermingling of past and present is constantly irritating and while the spoken German is a brave attempt at authenticity - though Viennese it is not - it is also jarring. What really kills the movie however are two things, the absolutely clunky script and the mediocre direction. You know exactly what's coming and how it's going to arrive. Yawn, just more Nazi kitsch. Regrettably even Mirren can't rescue this plodding effort",4,6,12,6 August 2015
Les Misérables," Avoid if you are musical
","This was not at all the right film for me because I love listening to beautiful singing and this was the exact opposite. Tom Hooper is a very capable director but getting untrained voices to handle this score was a total mistake. It is constantly painful to hear them simply barking out the lines, and it's not helped by the fact that the lines themselves are so thoroughly banal. The excellent acting, detailed recreation of 19th c. France and brooding drama of Hugo's great tale do not succeed in overcoming the agony of the so-called singing, which ruined some fine songs (though in truth there are not that many). For me hell would be having to sit through endless films in which Helena Bonham-Carter does her 'get me, I'm a little slut' act. UghBy the way, never was there a revolution with so many well fed, good looking insurgents.",1,2,5,13 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A good movie but far too long
","Nobody could deny that Leonardo Di Caprio turns in a fantastic performance in this movie. There are several standout scenes including his various speeches to his staff, the hilarious encounter with the FBI agents on his yacht, and above all the incredible gymnastics with the car at the country club. I found him absolutely credible as a man driven by - not exactly the pursuit of wealth, because he carries on long after he has more than enough - rather sheer energy, the need to be incessantly active, whether in making money or spending it.And it's the spending of the money that drags the film down. What on earth persuaded Scorsese that we needed not just one or two drug-fuelled orgies but so many they couldn't be counted? The film could have lost an hour with no damage at all to its narrative arc or its exploration of human greed and white collar criminality. Ironically, the movie didn't take up on the opportunity to pursue the consequences for the duped of Di Caprio's fraudulent schemes. A very short scene on the NYC subway showed what was missed in that regard. Instead we had the constant pounding of the stock selling, the drug taking, the crazy behaviour. In some ways a remarkable film which took the time to explain how the scheme worked but alas not to illustrate the damage it inflicted on the victims. It might have been Scorsese's masterpiece.",7,1,2,12 March 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," A very disappointing Coen brothers movie
","The Coen brothers make a lot of movies and some are better than others. This one is among the worst. The satirical targets are easy, the jokes thoroughly predictable, the plot ... well, it's another kidnap, another ransom note, another fade out. I seriously wonder why they bothered making it when it so closely resembles what they have done before. I couldn't believe the repeated use of the old sword joke, and the scene at the foot of the cross. Was there anything that wasn't as old as the hills? It was the Coen brothers so the stars queued up for their brief appearances, maybe because they were so stereotypical the demands made on their skill were minimal. To be fair, the direction was as good as ever and there were one or two scenes that did impress but what a disappointment from such talent! Their movie making career is starting to resemble that of Woody Allen.",4,1,3,18 March 2016
Life," Solid entry to the space monster genre
","'Life' was good, a respectable 3.5 out of 5, and it would have been a 4 but for the cop out ending, which I think reflected a lack of confidence on the part of its team in the quality of their output.The writers and director did not disguise their debt to 'Alien' and to a lesser extent '2001', and their overt referencing of those films was sensible - after all, with a plot like this one nobody can ignore such masterpieces. 'Life' stands up well to comparisons, being a well scripted and capably directed effort. I liked the way the members of the crew were fleshed out with backstory and some character development. There was a cost in terms of slackening tension but it was worth paying because you cared more about their fates. The creature was very well managed as was the spaceship interior. Action scenes were lively and full of impact.Yes, there were plenty of implausibilities, but I can live with those if the result is worth it. And in 'Life' it was.",7,4,11,26 March 2017
Inside Llewyn Davis," One of their best
","This is a funny, thought provoking, beautifully made film about another member of the seemingly endless line of Coen Bros losers. Some of the shots make you gasp, they are so lyrically filmed. I am surprised that so many viewers found it disappointing. The range of cameos by some of our best actors is an added attraction. Carey Mulligan is absolutely gorgeous and the role she plays very interesting. Above all there is the music, which as so often with the Coen Bros is one of their strongest points. The songs are crucial to the theme and tone of the movie. All this and a lovely ginger cat - really, it's hard to ask for more. Somebody said that in an ideal world every film would be directed by the Coen Bros and it's hard to disagree on a showing as convincing as this one",8,0,0,2 June 2014
