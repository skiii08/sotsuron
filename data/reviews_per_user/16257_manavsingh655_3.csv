It," When a brother takes revenge from a clown..
","This movie is not just horror.It does not have twists and turns.
It neither has suspense.So what makes it a movie worth watching?Such kind of movie has never been made before in my point of view.
Its about friendship n bravery.A friendship of bunch of boys who always get bullied by older tough guys and a girl who has become so weak inside due to personal issue with her father.When all of them come together,they pledge to solve the murder mysteries 
of kids which repeat after certain period of time.Ther are some moments of scare n thrill which will keep you on edge of your seat.But all it coveys is that people can fight the demons inside them
and can overcome the weakness.
And the friendship is all about unity.",6,0,2,5 February 2018
World War Z," Disappointment for serious zombie action lovers
","I am a huge fan of serious zombie movies.Some of them in my list are The Horde,Devil's playground,Dead Set Series which i consider better than World War Z as per the action sequences concerned with them.My expectations from World War Z were very high as i found trailer quite interesting.The scenes such as Zombies running and jumping on the people to catch n eat them and forming a very high pile to jump over a large wall were something new for the hardcore zombie fans..What left me disappointed was that all those scenes were already shown in the trailer and movie did'nt offer any more of such kind of eye catching sequences..Moreover the storyline is not strong enough to keep you hooked on your seats..Acting by almost all actors was good but direction was not upto the mark with some fighting sequences very fast paced thus affecting the visual clarity..Screenplay did suffer from some flaws but overall it was fine..Climax was impressive which perhaps made way for a sequel..All in all World War Z is a one time watch..No need to regret if you miss it..I rate it 5 out of 10",5,1,4,29 July 2013
The Descent," Do you call it a horror movie..HELL NO
",To be serious after watching the descent i was not able to decide whether to include it in horror genre or not..It did'nt scare me at all..I would have rated it better if it was an adventure thriller and not promoted as a horror film..More than 60 or 70 minutes of The descent consists of just adventure and some nice thrills with girls moving down and down inside the cave due to which the movie got the title The Descent..And as they descent down the cave we get to see some humanoid creatures which were perhaps the weakest things i have ever encountered in such type of films who were not too much for the girls..Had there been the cannibals the movie might have generated nice scary moments..For most of the time the girls dominate those creatures who were quite a lot in number as compared to just 5 or 6 girls..The director tries so hard to scare the hell out of the viewers but fails miserably otherwise if we talk of some thrill and adventure he has done a decent job.Special effects are fine too but not scary..What was more disappointing was the time devoted to the action sequences between the girls and those humanoid creatures which was less than 30 minutes..Had it been more i would have definitely rated it higher..Never the less The descent is watchable considering that you don't expect it to be a horror movie that will make you pis* your pants,5,1,2,29 July 2013
