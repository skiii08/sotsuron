The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A war fought over a teenage romance
","I really wanted to like this movie, trust me. I tried giving the books a shot and didn't like the style, the first movie was alright but the second was pretty good. This movie however, is filled with the most arbitrary plot points a five year old could possibly conceive. It seems that the entire resistance movement spends the movie convincing themselves that Katniss and her boy toy matter in the scheme of things. Honestly I'd be spoiling the plot if I elaborated, but it involves dropping flowers after a bombing run, throwing around intel like hot potatoes, and the weakest sleeper agent anyone could find. Honestly the presidents actions have become so contrived that every scene he had was him being filled in on how stupid his enemies were and then just staring off into the distance and muttering something cryptic. There were so many stupid scenes that I laughed out loud several times. There was seriously a scene where a deer looks at Katniss pointing a bow at it and just casually looks away. Gale then mutters 'it's never been hunted before.' Apparently the screenwriters believe fear and fight or flight are conditioned responses. There was also a scene with Katniss, a flashlight and a cat, where she plays that game that everyone plays with cats where they chase the light. As she does this she seems to have an epiphany about her current situation and I'm all like 'okay now this is good, the cat is the resistance, and the light symbolizes freedom. This could be some good stuff.' She then walks over to one of the other tribute boy toys and basically says that it made her realize she needs to save her boyfriend...So much potential for good sci-fi squandered on typical teen romance bullshit",3,26,37,2 December 2014
