The Ring," PLEASE WATCH THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION !!!
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I urge anyone who liked this movie ( or found it disappointing ) to PLEASE WATCH THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION because simply, this remake is not half as scary as the original. Don't get me wrong; I have nothing against the remake, I think it was decently done; but as a someone who appreciates good scare movies I think I should at least let the liked minded know if there's a better one out there - and there is.There are many reasons, technically and in the storyline itself that makes the original stand out. *possible spoilers ahead* Firstly, the music and sound effects were absolutely chilling - written by Kenji Kawai ( who wrote the music for Ghost in the Shell and Patlabor series  It was also very Japanese in flavour, which complemented very well with the other Japanese motifs that appeared on and off the movie ( ie, the japanese character Sadako inscribed on her eye, etc ). Secondly, the remake removes important plotlines from the original that strengthens the original story. For example, Sadako's mother ( and later herself ) were born with telekinetic/pyschic powers, which aptly explains why Sadako, even in her afterlife, continue to have devastating powers of curse ( in the form of the tape ). Also, the japanese versions of Noah and Aidan were also psychic, which explains why Aidan was able to communicate well with Sadako. In the original movie, Nanako ( Naomi's character ) becomes increasely desperate and worried for her son with each passing day to the coming of her death, ( in the final moments her love for her son puts her courage and strength to test ) but we see no such worry nor sense of urgency in the remake. Thirdly, THE ORIGNAL JAPANESE FOOTAGE OF THE TAPE SCARES LIKE S***. NO JOKE. There's a lot more I could go on about, but it'd be hard to explain unless you've seen both and did the comparison yourself.So again, if you liked this movie or think you're the kind that can't be scared, get the Japanese version, sit up alone at night, and challenge yourself. You wouldn't be disappointed.",Null,0,0,5 January 2003
