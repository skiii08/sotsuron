Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is strong with this one!
","I cannot understand why so many 'Star Wars Fans' don't like this movie. I am a fan of the original trilogy since I was six years old. I watched the three films for more than a hundred times and although I think that Episode 1 is even better.I guess that the old three films were loved by so many people for very different reasons. I loved them because they were great fantasy movies with hundreds of strange creatures,swordfights,adventure,heros,magic (although called Force)and amazing effects. The Phantom Menace beats the old trilogy in all these points. I agree that Jar Jar Binks is not funny but was C-3PO? No the golden gay was not!The digital effects are amazing and the created worlds of Theed,Coruscant and the Gungan World are perfect.Two full-skilled Jedi fighting against armies of droids and an incredible final battle make this movie my favourite.Although I can hardly wait for 'Lord of the Rings' I'm sure that it will never compete with Episode1,2,3.May the force be with you!",10,32,48,11 November 2001
