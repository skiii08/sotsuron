E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," What a beautiful movie!
","Hi, I'm studying in EF language school. Actually, I'm from Korea and in USA now. I watched this movie, ET, in my class. Then my teacher recommend to me writing down my review on this site. When I saw the movie, I thought that ET could speak was so funny. Such as 'ET phone home~'. However, FBI in the child's house is awkward. I think, because it's too old movie maybe. My favorite scene is at the moment when ET and child fly in full moon with bicycle. It's so beautiful and famous scene. Eliot, hero in the movie and his friends were really good at riding a bicycle! I saw that when they ran away from FBI. And they flew in the sky because of ET's magic. I want to do that, too. Lastly,emotional factors were very impressive. When Eliot and ET said good bye, I was so sad T.TAnyway, I don't know if my short review is good or bad. I just wanted to try to write my opinion on American Internet site. And I did~ It's my first time. Bye~",8,1,2,3 November 2009
