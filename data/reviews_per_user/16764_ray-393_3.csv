United 93," A chilling reminder
","Almost like watching a documentary. Some good casting (with the exception of the very wooden Air Traffic Control Centre head-man). Not done in the typical brash Hollywood style, simply a harrowing tale told in a very matter-of-fact way. Not sensationalised at all. Made in a respectful way to all the families of those who died, for instance, they resisted the temptation to show the build up to the two planes slamming into the twin towers (with the exception of a scene where the ATCC are watching CNN). This was nice to see, especially since it was the 'obvious' thing to do. They could have exploited those horrific images to the full without spending a cent on stunts, special effects, pyrotechnics - but they didn't. Well done to all involved. This film makes you think. Watching it now, you imagine that if you saw these terrorists at the airport, your suspicions would immediately be aroused, but thinking back to pre 9/11, the film depicts how everyone was oblivious to what was going on around them.",8,1,4,7 October 2007
The Exorcist," Truly the greatest horror flick of all time
","I'll keep this brief. It is my opinion that The Exorcist IS the greatest horror movie of all time, bar none, taking into account the year in which it was released and the social response at that time. Nowadays, the shock factor is gone. Our senses have been dulled by the constant flow of lame so-called horror films that promise so much but fail to deliver. When you consider that this little movie emerged from relative obscurity in 1973 at a time when people were a lot more fearful of religion than they are now, and when you look at the horrific imagery and blasphemous dialogue that was hurled at the unsuspecting cinema audiences, it is little wonder that some of their stomach contents made an even earlier exit than they did!",10,2,3,30 October 2005
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Refreshing film-making
","I'm very glad I watched this film. A little high-brow for me, I thought but no, it was engrossing from beginning to end. The story unfolded really well and it didn't pull any punches along the way. What I really liked was the way the dialogue was delivered so 'naturally'. It was really noticeable that the actors 'fluffed' their lines on more than one occasion and in any other film, these scenes would have been re-shot but these faux pas were left in and the film is all the better for it. I've never seen that done in any other film. It makes it true to life. How many of us speak eloquently 100% of the time, getting every sentence uttered in a word-perfect fashion? None of us, so why do they do this in films? It makes me look at films I've watched since in a different way, thinking much more about how many takes a particularly tricky piece of dialogue took to get right. Good stuff!",8,1,5,7 October 2007
