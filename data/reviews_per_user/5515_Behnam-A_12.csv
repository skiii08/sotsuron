Come and See," A great movie
","The movies starts rather slowly and just like a real storm rises up and up until it riches you with all its power and takes you up into the bloody, dusty, dirty and cruel atmosphere of the war.There are some exaggerations which I think are not unrealistic but maybe probability of their occurrence in a sequence is not high, even in the world war. However, I think it is intended and the scenes are masterfully developed to compress more necessary plots in the limited time of a movie.you will be introduced with the horror of war in the 30 minutes of the movie in which you haven't experienced before. No matter hoe many movies you have seen or how many stories you have read, you will have a new experience here for sure. Don't miss this movie",9,1,1,17 December 2017
It," Overrated
","This is probably the most overrated film ever. There was too much advertisements high ratings both among the critics and also on IMDB and other rating websites. However, that is the only thing that keeps you stay to the end after you start watching it. It is not scary at all, it is not a good comedy too, and the drama is also lame and you will be bored as hell. Then you think maybe it is been made only for kids, and then you think again even kids don't give a F to this clown. And you know what is weird the most? It is the final scene when they are preparing the audience for something like It (2) ! and then you leave the movie saying: Really?Oh, one more thing: It may amplify your disappointment in 2017 movies if you are not among the few lucky people who have only seen a few good ones or still haven't seen any of them.",1,3,5,19 December 2017
Monster," Outstanding performance and brilliant directing
","The movie is beyond excellent in the matter of directing and production aspects. The story is very well been presented where one can say it is not possible to do it better. The acting is superb as well especially Charlize Theron's magnificent performance.The story itself at the other hand is not as good as those perfect qualities. It could be paced better in the scenario I think. Turning worse from bad is something expected but showing the exact break points and the effects of the pas right in the present is not an easy job. I think scenario could have been written better in which the audience could see the chain of effects from the past while the current events happening, the true motives and how they work. The movie tells the story of a broken young girl turning bad and worse from an abused child to a prostitute and then a killer. That is well explained but while we see a movie about that process the most interesting part would be a detailed explanation of how that happens. I felt like the 'how' part lacks something after I have watched it.However, beside that lack of detailed scenario, the movie absolutely worth watching and is no doubt interesting. You will enjoy it for sure even if you are not a big fan of crime movies.",7,0,0,26 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Just an average marvel movie, maybe a little lower than average
","Although Captain Marvel is a typical lower than mid range superhero movie (which are full of cliches and plot holes), yet it is not a terrible one. If you are Ok with typical superhero movies and usual optimistic plot and happy ending in those kind of films then you can enjoy this one too.However, considering marvel's last significant improvement; Avengers : Infinity War; Captain Marvel is a huge let down. So be warned! if you expect something like Infinity War, Great disappointment is ahead.",3,4,7,10 March 2019
The Babadook," A unique horror movie
","Digging down to the depth of sadness and fear, this very symbolic film presents the harsh environment of loneliness and helplessness. I haven't watched a good movie for a while even though I watch at least for o five movies a week. theActing is brilliant, plot and the scenario are as well excellent.give it a shot, you wont regret it.",8,1,1,28 November 2018
Us," One of those 'going nowhere' Movies
","If we can categorize movies in two main classes: 1- ones that straightly stick to a subject and follow a solid story line and 2- those that use metaphors and symbolic expression of some phenomenon to deliver a message in a deeper way.Most Horror movies belong to the first category. Although there are some horror movies in the second group, except a handful of them like 'Babadook' and 'Oculus' they are disable to successfully perform the idea beyond the horror shell. I am not sure about this one in the matter of categorizing but I am sure that whichever it is it is a failure. You may consider some hidden layers especially in the first half but immediately you regret of thinking that way, so you have no choice to see it only as a horror tail having some sci-fi theme. And then again you see too many flows and nonsense plots that lead to nothing, not even the horror is scary enough. The only good the performances.So it is a complete waste of time and I think you may not enjoy it.",2,0,1,27 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An average movie, worth watching but not more
","Story and the plot are the foundation of any movie and this film isn'tr very well in that matter. of course much superhero movies are like that however.It is obvious that we can expect things that are not rational compare to real world in sci-fi or fantasy movies so we measure them in compare to their own introduced logic. we accept some basic unnatural things and then we follow the new rules. Based on the rules the marvel universe has introduced us previously, End Game has too many holes. characters suddenly get very stronger than what they were seconds before or in compare to their history with no reason. Time traveling bugs like in all other time traveling movies present here as well. this happens also to emotional relationships between them. movie has too many cliche scenes with boring dialogs.when we compare this one to Infinity war, it is a huge disappointment. However, it is still worth watching and if you are a fan of Sci-fi, it entertains you. It is just an average superhero movie.",3,43,75,26 April 2019
The Shape of Water," If you are going to watch this because it is an Oscar nominated movie, DO NOT WATCH IT!
","This movie is everything but a masterpiece or a very good one or perfect and titles like that. So if you are expecting something very special because it has been nominated for Oscar, Please highly avoid it or you will be disappointed. Well, actually it's better to avoid all the nominations maybe except 'Get Out' because movie-making machine in 2017 terribly sucks. You have been warned!",2,46,92,3 March 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Truly a masterpiece !
","You can not find even a moment that bothers you or you may say it can be removed, not even one second of it. And well, despite being all necessary to the plot, you enjoy it all. Sanity in story telling is at it's top, Dialogues are priceless and actors performance is brilliant(hats down to Morgan Freeman or the lovely Red, Thank you Sir for making this memorable experience available for us all). That scene with beers on the roof and after that when they talked about it in prison dining were simply reflection of the highest level of acting and plot development I have ever seen. I am Writing this review after watching this movie for more than fifty times in different occasions, having different moods and with different friends. And every time this movie took me out of my life to be consumed in Shawshank Prison trying to find a way to redemption alongside with Andy and Red,an excellent experience of pure enjoyment. I am no expert or critic reviewer but simply one can say something with this characteristics is a rare thing. I haven't yet met anyone who has watched it and didn't enjoyed it. This movie is a true masterpiece that deserves to be at the top.",10,0,0,2 September 2017
Mother!," being only mysterious doesn't make you smart, sometimes level downs you terribly
","If we assume this movie is about the story of god, religions and the creation, The idea of showing how religions can create, expand and be used by different people using the example of a hilarious book written by a brilliant writer is a good idea.However, to connect these two phenomenons together, some exact, solid, understandable and logical links are needed. in this matter, the movie was unbelievably awful. For example, we couldn't see how people went mad. maybe it was not important that why they went mad, but it was certainly crucial to find out how. People can't just get together in a house and suddenly decide to take walls down and steal the belongings of the owner. I mean yes, maybe people rush over each other to have a piece of a dress of a highly respected religious man but we know how that happens during history, we know they even get mad and kill for it but there is no logic when people of a modern society suddenly act like medievalists. leaving that for audience to guess is not smart at all, it indicates that the plot has nothing to fill that gape.Similarly, How those leaders in the crowed came to be leaders, who were they? why them? and more importantly there is no need even for a man with the need to be worshiped by his fans to sacrifice his own house and family. Even if we accept based on religious stories the god did that(by sacrificing the greatest archangel), there was a disobedient on the table which was missing here. There was too many missing links and too many rushed conclusions without any logic to support them. Now, if we assume the movie to be about man and the nature relation and selfishness of man, we can't even find similarities in that case! And if it is just a dramatic thriller movie(which I don't think it is), it is a very awful one again.I don't give it 1 only because of the general idea of criticizing the religious story of creation(the only possible reason of making this movie that comes to my mind) and the good performance of Jennifer Lawrence.",4,3,7,8 December 2017
Annihilation," Perhaps Biology explains the psychology better!
","Annihilation is a movie that needs a little more attention if you want to enjoy it completely. I found it very symbolic which includes some inner (maybe hidden to first look) layers of psychology behind its sci-fi outer shell.Unlike many other metaphoric movies, I think using metaphors was an excellent idea to explain a complex phenomenon like psychological changes of human mind while it faces serious challenges and the overall path of humanity that is heading to final extermination. Using Biology as a tool to explain it is also a very brilliant idea. You can simply pick that up when the psychologist which is also the expedition team's leader clearly gives the hint while she is explaining the difference between suicide and self destruction and then she says perhaps you(the biologist) can explain it better.
This Movie is about people's reaction to challenges, the way they look at themselves and when they face their true nature, the way they try to pull themselves out of the big universal failures of the humanity and the effects that remains even if the power of the will is strong enough to pull them out. I will not go further through details in order to avoid spoiling the story. Go watch it for yourself and enjoy it.
 
The cinematography is very good, green views and beautiful imaginative pictures of alien form plants and environment are interesting especially considering the budget of the movie. In the matter of acting, it is simple because the characters has been written that way so maybe you won't be able to say if a person's performance is good or not. Especially for Natalie Portman, I think her talent is way beyond her character so obviously she plays it the best way and obviously it is meaningless to judge her performance based on it.Finally I can say if you are a person who is interested in complex ideas especially in subjects like psychology, I definitely recommend this movie. If you are only interested in sci-fi aspects and mysterious ideas you will also enjoy it but not as much as movies with big budgets and huge computer works.",8,4,9,16 March 2018
Law Abiding Citizen," Usual plot holes, good story, Awful ending!
","This movie was all good until the final 20 minutes.A man who has access to such resources and being that smart just got surprised simply through some property research. And that research was not introduced to audience in which it clarifies its importance. That was a total downfall. It was a good movie with some usual holes in the plot that I could ignore them and enjoy the movie. but that last 20 minuets ruined it into the ground.If you wanna watch this movie, be warned, you may enjoy most of the movie, However you will be greatly disappointed at the end.",2,1,2,24 September 2017
