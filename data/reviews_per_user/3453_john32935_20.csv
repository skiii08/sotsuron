Million Dollar Arm," Not quite a home run, but not a strike out either
","This is a well-intentioned film, based on a true story, of a sports agent trying to score a big break by being the first to raise interest in baseball to the potentially huge audience in India. Since it is a Disney film, it tends to follow the underdog-makes-good formula without detouring far from the predictable course. As such, it does not live up to the enchantment in director Craig Gillespie's prior work 'Lars and the Real Girl,' perhaps being constrained by the true story element or the oversight at the Mouse House. Still, it is a generally likable film and one that is pretty safe for the whole family.Jon Hamm does a competent job as the lead sports agent finding his way in India and in his own life. Mr. Hamm is well cast as his considerable charm helps to raise the scenes above the dialog and plot which at times can fall to the level of the made-for-TV genre.To see my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",6,0,0,1 February 2015
Black Swan," Just a mess
","I do not understand Black Swan's receipt of so much critical acclaim or box office popularity. To me the film is a mess and not worth seeing.The story is about a competition between 2 ballerinas for the lead role in the production of Swan Lake at a prestigious NYC ballet company. Fine so far. I am not a big fan of ballet, but I can appreciate the rigor of the dancers' training, the competition among the performers for the spotlight, and the grace and athleticism of their performance. What I cannot appreciate is director Darren Aronofsky's muddled approach to this world's presentation, including the representation in the psychologically disturbed world of one of lead characters (Natalie Portman in an Oscar-winning performance). The characters are two dimensional, the script is a hackneyed jumble of film clichés, and the plot is obvious. If you love dance and want to see films about it, there are far better ones to see, including the seminal, The Red Shoes, as well as Julia, to name just two.The only good thing I can say about this film is that it better than Mr. Aronofsky's followup project, Noah, which is even worse.",3,2,4,20 January 2015
The Equalizer," Non-stop action
","I am not a fan of violence in movies, especially when done to excess. This movie pushes past my normal limit for body count, but it is done is such a way, i.e., without much gore, that I did not find it gratuitous or off-putting. Additionally, Denzel Washington turns in another stellar performance as a man of violence (e.g., Training Day, among others) that the viewer does not mind the extreme willing suspension of disbelief that the director requires.Mr. Washington's character has very little in the way of backstory although his motivation is readily apparent. I suspect that some explanatory scenes were cut from the final print since the movie runs long at over 2 hours. Also I find it difficult to believe that both Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo, each leading actors in their own right, were cast as old friends of Mr. Washington's character with the original intention that they would have about 3 minutes of combined screen time. It seems that these characters would have been the time when the backstory would have been revealed.While there is nothing really new in this movie that makes it a must-see, it is well-shot, action-packed, and, as stated above, well-acted thereby earning a viewing recommendation.To see more of my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",7,2,5,16 March 2015
Training Day," A Star Shines in Training Day
","In his Oscar-winning performance, Denzel Washington inhabits the role of the street-tough narcotics cop to such an extent that you forget that, prior to this movie, Mr. Washington had begun to be stereo-typed as the perpetual good guy. No one ever denied that Mr. Washington could act, but by casting against type (as is often the case) people finally noticed the depth and breadth of his acting skills.Of course, in order to truly shine, an actor needs other elements to be in place as well. And Mr. Washington has them all here. His co-star, Ethan Hawke, does an excellent job of providing the innocent counterbalance so that Mr. Washington looks even tougher by comparison. The action sequences are well shot and grittily realistic. The plot twists, while not truly shocking, are unique enough to keep the movie's tension at a high level throughout.To see my other reviews, please visit: https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",8,1,1,25 January 2015
Friday Night Lights," Almost as great as the TV show
","It was difficult to watch this movie as I am a big fan (along with many, many others) of the TV show that was based on this movie (and the book on which it was based). However, if you can leave behind your love for the fantastic casting of Connie Britton and Kyle Chandler as Tammy and Coach Taylor, you will also love this movie for the same reasons you loved the TV show. The depth of the character portrayals are as rich as those developed in the TV show, and the dialog rings as true there as here. And who does not love an underdog sports story.'Being perfect is not about that scoreboard out there. It's not about winning. It's about you and your relationship with yourself, your family and your friends. Being perfect is about being able to look your friends in the eye and know that you didn't let them down because you told them the truth. And that truth is you did everything you could. There wasn't one more thing you could've done. Can you live in that moment as best you can, with clear eyes, and love in your heart, with joy in your heart? If you can do that gentleman - you're perfect!'Or as the TV show condensed this speech: 'Clear eyes, full heart, can't lose.'The movie is not perfect, but it is darn close.For more of my movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",8,0,1,25 February 2015
Begin Again," Clichés avoided
","I am a big fan of movies in which the writer and/or director do not make the easy/clichéd choice. I can now add Begin Again to that club.The plot is simple even if little optimistic. Gretta (Keira Knightley) moves to NYC with her long-time boyfriend (and song-writing partner) when the boyfriend is signed to a big label. Of course, the romance does not survive the newly-found fame (ok, that was a clichéd choice but I can live with that). Gretta now has to find her own way, without her partner (romantic and song-writing). Her discovery by a down-and-out music label exec (Mark Ruffalo) (ok, another cliché) allows her to grow and to get her own chance to sign to a record label. But Gretta makes the unexpected choices regarding romance, recording, and her future (hence the membership to the non-cliché club). OK, you can see some of these choices coming but may not actually expect the characters to go through with them. Kudos also for not allowing the close-knit relationship between the two leads to develop into romance. Platonic relationships do exist and the film recognizes that.Good dialog, good use of NYC for making ambient song recordings, and good acting all- around (including a credible job by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 as the jilting boyfriend). A special treat also for fans of the world of struggling musicians.This makes me want to add director John Carney's prior work, Once, to my queue of movies to be seen.",8,1,3,20 January 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel successfully breaks away from its own mold
","With Captain America – The Winter Solder, Marvel steps away from its mega-moneymaking formula of witty dialog and action, action, and more action and moves into a darker direction based on suspense and political intrigue. Surprise, the movie still is a mega-moneymaker. That is mostly because Marvel retained an engaging cast (Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson), top- notch action sequences, and brought Captain America into today's world where moral ambiguities predominate the absolutist approach to good vs. evil.This film will be enjoyed by anyone who has enjoyed prior Marvel offerings but should probably only be seen if you are familiar with Captain America's back-story through the comics or the first movie, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).",7,0,0,20 January 2015
Divergent," More than a Hunger Games ripoff
","This movie has me torn and may qualify as a guilty pleasure. While clearly in the same category of Young Adult novel adaptation as the mega-successful Hunger Games trilogy, this first installment of the Divergent series has some obvious similarities and some differences. I think the similarity that has me liking this movie is the strong female lead played wonderfully by Shailene Woodley. However, Divergent's dialog is weaker, its plot more obvious, and its philosophy delivered more heavy-handedly; all-in-all making it the inferior of the two series' initial installments.I understand that the movie also sanitized some of the more violent aspects of the book in order to avoid the harsher R-rating which would have hurt its box office potential. Such loss hurts the movie as the danger element is not as apparent as one would like to better vest the viewer in the trials of the lead character.Are these flaws enough to make the film unwatchable? No. Are the strengths of the movie (Ms. Woodley, good CGI and production design) enough to give the movie a strong recommendation to watch? No, too. However, if you are a fan of science fiction and action- adventure (whose body count is high but whose gore is very limited), you too make like this movie. But if you are looking for Oscar-caliber movie-making, this is not for you.",6,0,1,20 January 2015
The Lego Movie," More than a glorified product placement piece
","The Lego Movie was one of 2014's biggest blockbusters bringing over $257 million domestically, so the chances are you have seen this already. But if you were reluctant as I was, you may still be thinking about it as award season rapidly approaches.As the budget for the animated movie is reported to be only about $60 million, it is no doubt that sequels, prequels, and related projects are rapidly in the works at Warner Brothers, proving once again that there is vast market for good, family-friendly movies.Wait, did I say 'good?' Well, much to my chagrin, I did wind up liking the movie more than I had expected. The animation is outstanding. The voice casting is spot on and quite diverse – Chris Pratt, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks, the 3 Wills (Forte, Arnett and Ferrell), Tom Welling, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Morgan Freeman, among many others. The story, while not original, has enough twists to keep it interesting for young and old. But be warned, the theme song 'Everything is Awesome' is just catchy enough that it will stick in your head more than you want or are willing to admit.As with most good movies aimed mostly for the young audience, this movie keeps the grown-ups interested with a non-ending stream of insider references. You do not need to catch the director's knowing winks to the audience to understand the story, but it is enjoyable to see how many they sneak in.In short, you can safely watch this with your children without fear of wasting their time or yours. You can even watch it if there are no children in the audience.",7,0,1,20 January 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Melodrama successfully avoided
","Two teenage cancer survivors find each other and fall in love – sort of sounds like a trashy romance novel, an After School Special, or a Lifetime movie. Yet, somehow, this adaptation of the best-selling novel moves beyond those melodramatic hazards into a touching portrayal. Shailene Woodley continues her string of good to great performances and her march towards stardom. Ms. Woodley and Ansel Elgort provide the grace, charm and lift which takes the storyline (and sometimes dialog) laden with potential pitfalls into an engaging film about growing up, love and loss. The supposed twist at the end is not very hard to foresee but still it does not take way much from this well-crafted movie.",7,0,0,20 January 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Not sure I would vacation here, but well worth a movie visit
","One of the darlings of 2015's pre-Oscar activities, Wes Anderson creates a world full of quirky characters, bold costumes and scenery, and most importantly, witty dialog.While the plot of the movie is slightly convoluted from the normal Hollywood formula, it really is Mr. Anderson's fantasy world that captures and keeps the audience's attention. Bold colors. Quirk characters. Unexpected plot twists and turns. And a story that sort of leads you somewhere, but you never know where.As long as you are not expecting a typical action-adventure movie, I highly recommend visiting The Gand Budapest Hotel.",8,2,4,20 January 2015
Mr. Nobody," Total pretentiousness
","After having watched the disaster that is the disaster film 'Noah' earlier this week, I thought that I had my selection for worst movie I had watched this year. Well, lo and behold, we have a new contender with Mr. Nobody. This is pretentiousness posing as art. The sad thing is that way too many people have bought into it.While at times visually stunning, the 'story' centers on Nemo who as a pre-teen had to choose with whom he would live after his parents divorced. The movie then goes on to show several possible lives that he could have lived all the while juxtaposing the various story lines, as well as jumping back and forth in time, all to advance the 'deep' theory that choices have consequences. And it takes the movie over 2 1/2 hours to say that. Sadly, I cannot jump back in time and stop myself from putting this DVD in the player.This movie is a collaboration among many international organizations including French backers, which probably should have been a clue to me about the movie's potential for being watchable. Here is a very telling quote from the movie as the main character Nemo is being interviewed:Young journalist: Do you remember what the world was like before telemerization? Quasi-immortality? What was it like when humans were mortals?Nemo Nobody aged 118: There were cars that polluted. We smoked cigarettes. We ate meat. We did everything we can't do in this dump and it was wonderful! Most of the time nothing happened like a French movie.And that pretty much sums up this movie. Nothing happens.",2,4,7,20 January 2015
22 Jump Street," Sequel worth seeing
","This sequel to the surprise mega-hit 21 Jump Street (2012) follows the same winning formula and gets the same winning result. Again smartly relying on the excellent on screen chemistry between stars Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, non-stop broad (OK, borderline vulgar) humor, massive explosions, exciting chase sequences, and knowing winks to the camera, 22 Jump Street will not surprise anyone. But if you liked the first movie, the sequel manages to provide the same level of entertainment without being boring.Be sure to stay for the ending credits for some more laughs regarding some hypothetical sequels.For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",8,1,3,31 January 2015
Jersey Boys," The hits just keep coming
","If you are a fan of the music of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons you will love this movie. If you are unfamiliar with their music, take a chance on this movie, and you may learn to love it too. If you do not like their music, well there is a chance you will like this movie anyway. I fall into the first category.Adapted from the Broadway play, the movie traces the growth of 4 young teens from the gangster streets of New Jersey, to the rise to the top of the pop music world, the breakup of the group due to financial strains and internal bickering, the rise of Frankie Valli as a solo star, and their reunion at the induction in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. Throughout the film their music and the wonderful performances (both dramatic and musical) by the 4 actors will bring a smile to your face.While the beginning is a little slow as director Clint Eastwood develops the background of their youthful interactions with the wrong side of the law, the pace picks up one the hits start coming. And come they do.The film probably could have done without some of the vulgar language even if still trying to maintain the realism of the story. The R-rating may be a little harsh compared to other movies and it probably did hurt the film at the box office.For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",8,0,0,1 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," DId I miss the 90s?
","In the latest collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio (still with no love from the Academy), we get a glimpse into the world of high finance, high living, greed, decadence and corruption in the Wall Street of the 1980s. With Mr. Scorsese's usual excellent direction and Mr. DiCaprio's charisma, the 3 hour movie never pauses for a moment or allows the viewer to become bored.The plot is straight-forward without any surprises yet remains interesting on the sheer power of the director and the star. Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) starts as a straight-laced, young Wall Street broker eager for the things only money can buy. But after being laid off following Black Monday, Belfort learns about the world of finance removed from the glitzy world of Wall Street. Learning to take advantage of his salesmanship skills and the ignorance of the general populace (as well as the undermanned regulatory agencies), Belfort amasses a huge fortune illegally which he spends visibly and without restraint on drugs and women. When finally cornered by the FBI on his illegal activities, Belfort first chooses to fight before finally facing the reality that all is lost.The movie fully earns its R Rating for the record-setting number of F-bombs, as well as rampant drug use and graphic scenes throughout.",8,2,5,20 January 2015
Mary and Max," A wonderful journey
","The details in this claymation movie are beyond outstanding. But, more importantly, the script is witty, original and moving.The 2 main characters, a lonely, young girl in Australia and a mid-40s single male in NYC suffering from Asperger's (each beautifully voiced by Tino Collette and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, respectively), begin and maintain a pen-pal relationship that is initially random and bizarre but turns into the most important friendship for these 2 people who suffer from social isolationThe ups-and-downs in 2 decades of correspondence avoids the sugar-sweet path that could have easily been followed. Instead, we watch the growth of these two people, each with flaws, learn to accept the other and themselves.",8,1,3,20 January 2015
Shall We Dance," Romance is alive and well
","Richard Gere films fall into 2 categories me: 'really like' and 'really dislike.' There seems to be little gray area. Count this one strongly in the 'really like' column.An Americanized-version of the original Japanese film, the story is centered on Mr. Gere's character and his willingness to break his routine looking for more from life (some people do not appreciate how good they have it). His life from the outside looks enviable – great job, great wife (Susan Sarandon) and great family. But as Mr. Gere commutes home every night he spots the lovely and lonely-looking Jennifer Lopez peering out the window of a dance studio. On a whim, Mr. Gere jumps off the train and into the studio hoping to meet Ms. Lopez. He is quickly taught that there is no hope there, but in the process learns that he loves to dance. As his wife becomes suspicious of a change in his routine and attitude, she learns of his secret lessons and questions the reasons for them and the secrecy. To say more would spoil the plot, and that would be just wrong.I recommend this as a wonderful movie to watch – for young and old, for a great date movie, and even a great Valentine's movie. Just a warning to the male viewers, your woman may visibly swoon at the sight of Mr. Gere in a tuxedo carrying a red rose for his lady. Hard for us normal guys to live up to that image.",8,0,0,20 January 2015
Moon," More than science fiction
","A fantastic, small movie that forces you to think about the future, the impact of isolation, bio-ethics and more.The setup is simple: in the near future, man establishes a working base on the moon to mine for mineral resources for the Earth. Sam Rockwell (in a fantastic portrayal) plays the sole person manning the operation and he is nearing the end of his 3 year commitment. He yearns to return to Earth and his family as he has had limited contact during his service time with anyone other than the interactive (talking) computer running the station. When he makes a discovery regarding an apparent accident, he questions all of his underlying assumptions about himself.",9,1,4,20 January 2015
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Movie lacks focus
","Notable as Angelina Jolie's first movie as a director (and also as the screenwriter), this movie fails in many respects.The movie mainly centers on the life of one woman in the Bosnian war as she is held captive by a soldier who alternately protects her from the severely harsh life as a prisoner and then physically abuses her and kills her kinsmen. Had the movie just focused on this story from her point of view, it may have succeeded. But the movie strays into plot lines of military strategy of the civil war, other prisoners and horrors they face, the politics of the 'outside world' ignoring the on-going genocide, and more. Each of those could have also been a successful story, but when combined into a single film, we are left with a jumbled mess of a story all the while relentlessly bombarded with Ms. Jolie's message that 'war is bad.' Since the atrocities shown are all performed by one side, it is clear that Ms. Jolie is also lecturing us as to who she believes the bad guys are. While I do not expect a Hollywood movie to be the equivalent of a documentary, since Ms. Jolie intended to show more than just the story of the captive woman, she should have (and easily could have) included a little more balance to the political agenda.For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",3,3,7,31 January 2015
Draft Day," Sign me up for more
","n the most recent of Kevin Costner's sports-based movies, here Mr. Costner plays Sonny, an age-appropriate General Manager of the lowly Cleveland Browns. The movie is set entirely in the day of the annual college draft. Despite the distractions of a recently deceased father (and beloved former Browns coach), a mother who chooses draft day as the only day to hold the memorial service, and a relationship with a office colleague who tells Sonny of her pregnancy on draft day, the film wisely minimizes those tangential subplots (they could have been lost entirely in my opinion) and focuses on the pressures of the wheeling and dealing and the last minute decision-making of the General Manager. Even more wisely, the film lets Mr. Costner do what he does best – serve as the center point for calm amongst all the chaos.Most of the characters are fictional although some notable cameos are made by players, sportscasters and the commissioner all appearing as themselves. I was a little concerned when I learned that it was the first film endorsed by the NFL (as evidenced by the commissioner's ample screen time) but the endorsement seemingly did not impact the storytelling to any real degree. I suspect if the NFL endorsement had not been obtained, some of the players may have had some more negative traits (PED history, crime and the like) which would not impact the story anyway. While there are no dirty tricks played, there are some wilely negotiations that ring mostly true in style and spirit. The excitement and pressure of being 'on the clock' are wonderfully portrayed.",7,2,3,20 January 2015
