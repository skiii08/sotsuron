Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This film shows the humor disconnect between adults and youths
","Anyone over 30 who enjoys this film is a very sick puppy, as it only should appeal to immature 12-14 year old boys and some very challenged older sympathetics who think that gross verbal and visual bathroom humor is the ultimate in funny. Borat was nothing more than a moronic fake documentary liberally doused with overt and base racial, sexual and toilet joke attempts and scenes that were meant to offend and were not even close to any real humor that takes real effort, thought and instincts to pull off. I didn't laugh once but sure did cringe a lot. I guess it's OK with today's youths to be a racist in the USA if you use a fake foreign accent and try(but fail miserably) to be funny as you slobber and mispronounce your racial slurs. No sale here.This gross, crass, and no-class experiment in very amateurish filmmmaking was impossible for me to watch(I left after 40 minutes of pure torture)as it added nothing to my storehouse of real humor, and added only to my sad awareness that the young people who liked it have a very different and much lower set of standards of 'humor' appreciation that is way out of bounds for anyone older than 30. Ads stating 'The funniest movie ever!' are a total trumped up shill/fraud by people who stand to gain from it and are as low grade as this scummy slime of a film.I know that mental children of all ages who liked it a lot('Oh, my god!')will read this and disagree, but this was not written for them but for older, smarter and much wiser souls who may be wondering about whether they should spend a couple hours of their lives on some movie entertainment by seeing Borat. Warning To Anyone Over 30: This film will be very hazardous to your mental health and to your already slim hope that this world will be eventually turned over to people who can run it for 10 minutes without the earth self destructing in disgust.Where is a shower, I need a shower, a very long one with lots of soap and maybe some strong disinfectant. Ughhhhhh.",1,38,76,22 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," OK, not great
","Iron Man is much better. If you read further than this I'll tell you what was wrong or missing. Here are just a few: < 1. Way too many leaps of faith needed, as too many details were taken for granted and not explained or just eliminated as the story flew past. But, it was made for kids and what do they know? < 2. Edward Norton was totally miscast. Too wimpy. Too hurt little boy looking. Liv Tyler, she of the big botox upper lip, was also way too tall for him. < 3. The Hulk's face looked like a cross between Michael J. Fox and Ray Liotta. Not scary at all, unless little boy faces scare you. Just a little boy Bluto head on top of a Lou Ferrigno on mutant monster steroids body, just an everyday green body you see all the time. < 4. Why did the Hulk have to roar like a gorilla or a lion all the time? Just for scares? Didn't work. Not with that little boy face. And, people, even Hulk/people, don't do that all the time where I live. < 5. If bullets and bombs, etc. couldn't take him out, how could the Hulk hurt his little headie-poo by bumping it on a cave ceiling? < 6. The movie set up yet another sequel so obviously and shamelessly it could have been a classroom case study on 'what not to do when ending a good film', except for Hollywood blockbuster action filmmakers only caring about all the money they make from kids now and on the endless sequels, even if it is their parent's money. What do they care? < 7. This was the very last Hulk I will pay for. Seen it all.",6,2,6,30 June 2008
Captain Phillips," Ineresting, but too long
","Pretty good tale based on true events, but dramatized and fictionalized for entertainment effect. Tom was an everyman ship captain, and was more or less the way we like to see him, but his role was not as humanly personal or as special as his parts were in Castaway, or Philadelphia, for example. We did not get to see much of the Tom Hanks that is so endearing to audiences for decades, as he was more of less just a ship captain doing his job here.I do not like ships so the story had to be good to interest me, and it did a pretty good job of that even as I felt the film overall was too long and tried to sustain fear and suspense beyond what was believable for full effect, and especially the long and overdone part in the lifeboat. We could only be shocked by one or more 'shoot him if he moves' statements, but there were way too many of those to sustain a high tension and believability level. To me, it finally became tedious. Also, from the few seamen I have known,, the crew on the ship appeared much too wimpy and scared for 'real men'. However, the Navy rescue scenes were involving and well done.My main questions of the story are about ship security. Tens of millions of dollars of cargo and not one gun for security on the ship? How could that be? No arms or security system at all. A few weapons and that piracy would never have happened. And, no wonder Republicans want a big defense budget, as the cost to taxpayers of providing Navy security for private business ships has to be huge, and of course, free to them. Even taxpayers who never buy any of the products on that ship have to pay for that protection. That is just not right. Those private ships should have their own security and not military security paid by the American taxpayer.I am sure our gov't will get right on that.",7,2,5,28 October 2013
3:10 to Yuma," OK, but nothing great
","Too many historical inaccuracies to ever get my nod as great, as the much too lenient way in which Ben Wade(Crowe) was escorted to justice just never would have happened in the old frontier west. Look at an old west crime history book with photos sometime in your library and see that captured criminals were chain-shackled from head to toe, hardly able to move a finger let alone kill two men en route and still, yes still, be treated with the kid glove leniency and poor security shown in this film. No way this would have ever happened, and the presence of 21st century security and emotional softness toward criminals in a 19th century, hard scrabble, tough-guy western story was laughable to me as a frontier historian.Eastwood did this too with Japanese soldiers in his Letters From Iwo Jima, putting the same 21st century body language and belligerent attitudes towards authority in Asian soldiers who never in a million years would have ever acted that way 65 years ago. I think both of these filmmakers feel that modern movie goers need to relate to speech patterns and attitudes they are familiar with, as honest 19th century speech, manners and social practices would be too foreign for viewers to relate to? I don't think so. Why don't they try it sometime for accuracy, integrity and honesty, and see if we like it? I, for one, would be a lot more happy with truth and realism than with someone's fictionalized tall tale of what sells better to movie goers.The obvious, but never overtly expressed, devoted hero worship angle tending toward homosexual adoration expressed toward Wade by his psychotic #2 in charge was probably missed by most viewers, but that subdued part was possible in real life then even among cold blooded killers, as almost all feelings and emotions in the old west were heavily repressed and thus seldom surfaced except in nuance. It was not an age for touchy feelie sentiment or for being overtly 'queer' in the manly world of frontier crime. That being said, with all true-to-life story realism put in your pocket and never given a thought again while you watched this film, it was entertaining as pure shoot-em-up escapist fare but was certainly no Shane or Red River or Once Upon A Time In The West. Not even close.",7,1,3,24 September 2007
United 93," Interesting , engaging, and well done
","Excellent quasi-documentary of a tragic flight. The airport traffic control center scenes were especially dramatic and authentic-appearing as the boss shown was the real guy in charge that very day, not an actor. He was a natural! And, I especially liked the everyday lead-in scenes to the main story that showed travelers, planes, airports, employees, etc., going about their typical daily business and jobs before any alarms were raised. Really well done story development.As much of this film's story is necessarily supposition as there were no survivors to tell the real story, surely a lot of it is not exactly as it happened and much was surely added for dramatic effect to make an engrossing movie. All facts cannot be known so a lot of guesswork and deduction was obviously necessary, and we just can't know how much of what was shown in the film really happened and how much was dramatic film-making. The plane flight scenes were scary and effective, with the passengers showing their individual humanity in their many emotions ranging from cool control all the way to abject basket cases. The Arabic hijackers were shown as vicious, cruel and sadistic as hell but this may have been exaggerated for effect as they may have actually been more coolly efficient; we just don't know what really happened. But, what was shown made for an extremely dramatic film even if it may not have been wholly accurate.The military's part in the film was shown as frantic and unorganized, and pathetic in results, as no one really knew what the hell to do so they ran around in circles. No one higher up seemed to want to make the 'big' decision to attack the hijacked airliner even as it sped toward Washington, D.C.! Finally sending up 2 unarmed jets was a sure sign of hopeless unpreparedness and incompetence from the outfit that is supposed to guard our country. It was really embarrassing and maddening to me to know that at least some of what was shown actually happened. Are we better prepared now? The only criticism I have of the film-making is that it took at least 5 minutes for the many angry male passengers to storm the cockpit and get to the pilot, having to overcome just two Arabs, one food cart in the way, and one thin cockpit door. The filmmakers surely had to guess about those details, but I thought those determined men could have easily gotten to the pilot in much less time, as 5 minutes is an eternity in a severe crisis situation like that. The stretched-out time line was most likely an example of artistic license done to draw out the intense dramatic tension. Getting there quicker probably wouldn't have made any difference in the outcome anyway but it was the only thing in the film that rang false to me.The filmmaker did do an overall great job in scaring the wits out of us and portraying the actual terror that had to be in the hearts of those doomed passengers. And, the heroism of those who finally attacked the hijackers should be lauded forever as a sign of true American courage and part of what makes us a great and powerful country.",8,0,2,8 May 2006
In Bruges," 'Isn't vicious murder funny? Let's make a comedy about it.'
","Don't much like films made like this one. Ultimately psychopathically vicious, treacherous, and murderous but....'let's have big fun with it by making bloody murder and psychopathic hit men funny in the beginning before we get down to the real cruel blood and guts at the end'...... more or less a tired copy of one of Tarantino's films like Pulp Fiction, and it was mostly a one trick pony commercially calculated to depict sick but marginally entertaining segments of contrived and cruel human behavior including all the violence, blood and suffering an audience could stand for 2 hours without turning theaters into vomiteriums. The worst aspect of this film was that it shamelessly copied others in this genre who have done a much better job of it, like Tarantino, Peckinpah, and Scorcese. In Bruges was two disparate films tacked together.....the first one was a goofy, near Monty Python sketch of a forced stay in Bruges, Belgium by two joking and wise-cracking hit men sent there by their head man to cool off after a botched assignment in the UK, and the second part was a cruelly vicious and bloody version of a typical Peckinpah/Scorcese/Tarantino film of terminal comeuppance and payback for treachery and nearly limitless earlier sins. The two film parts and the character's actions in each part did not match well and thus the result looked contrived and uneven overall and appeared to be done by one who has a lot to learn about what makes a film good, and that includes consistent characterization that he did not well control. And, it does not include shamelessly copying a story style done better many times in the past 40 years and essentially pretty worn down by now.So, to me there was little substance that was interestingly new or different here. Instead, go see No Country For Old Men for this story genre done as well as it can be done. But, Bruges did look like a nice place to visit.",6,8,23,3 March 2008
Two for the Money," Lame title but good movie with lots of 12 step program philosophy
","Al Pacino is the greatest and most natural talent in the movie biz. Everything he does rings so true, and we can't take our eyes of him when he is doing it. He sure has left DeNiro in the dust and is now America's premier senior actor.TFTM is a love story, oh yes it is, because all stories are love stories, every single one. The presence of love or the absence of it is at the heart of all stories, and this one is no exception as there are no exceptions. But this one is so special due to Pacino and his magnificent talent in making us believe this fairy tale was real and magical. Renee Russo was very good as his checkered-past wife and chief backsliding preventer(gambling), and Matthew McConaughy was terrific cast as the hunky, can't miss, football score prognosticator who made it big in Pacino's sports line empire and then......well, see the film. Ever see Wall Street? Nuff said. Armand Assante was also good in a small but easy role....the bad guy who hated losing, as opposed to a real addict who loves it as it reinforces his self hate. Al spewed lots of spot-on 12 step program self-help philosophy and personal insights throughout, and as we are all in our own personal 12 step program of some type or another, it kept my attention glued to him as his brilliance alone was worth the ticket price.Pacino's character had all the good/great lines, as he should have had. Especially great was his stunning address to a 12 step program group about addiction. Believe me, he was right on the money. But, how his really bad heart stood up to all his manic shenanigans, drinking, and smoking, I'll never know. Perhaps he needed them to really feel alive. Hey, it's a movie.Whether you agree or disagree with gambling, this film is sure to entertain you greatly with its NYC rich slickness and deep look inside the huge sports line 'business'. Or, see it for your latest Al Pacino fix, and you'll be glad you won that gamble, you addict you.",7,5,11,7 October 2005
The Impossible," First half great, second half not
","The bad last half of this film ruined the great first half and made it an overall loser to me. Great visual effects of a violent tsunami and its catastrophic aftermath gradually turned into a sappy, maudlin, Family Channel-level tear-jerker with tons of group hugs, tears, and scenes manufactured wholly to activate the tear glands and the wallet. Scenes of The Perfect Family(none truly exist)early on so obviously portended horrible things later, as everything coming later was so telegraphed in advance that the outcome was obviously predictable.........the perfect family was all back together and it was going to be so perfect once again! Wow! No. Ugh.Say goodnight, John Boy!",5,0,5,18 January 2013
Midnight in Paris," Another cutie from Woody
","Woody has a way of making romantic comedies so attractive in person and in location that you always want to be there too. I would bet that tourism to Paris increases this summer due to this film. And, Paris never looked lovelier, as the first 3 minutes of the film was a running postcard of still-shots of Paris' greatest and most beautiful sights. Just an inspired leadoff for a film full of great shots.The idea was that the Woody character, this time the well-rumpled Owen Wilson as Gil, a frustrated novelist and Hollywood screenwriter, was half of an engaged couple who, along with his fiancé Inez' elitist parents, visit Paris. For many good reasons, he opts out of doing the sights with her parents and ends up going walking alone at midnight. He, as in a fantasy, meets a strange classic limo that stops, people inside beckon for him to get in, which he does, and he is instantly transported back to the Paris of the 20's, the era in which he always longed to live. He does this same midnight escapade again and again, and in time he wondrously meets all of the famous Paris artists of that day. These fantastic adventures determined the course of the story, which also included Michael Sheen as an arrogant, pedantic college professor friend of his fiancé that Woody, I mean Owen as Gil, detested. His fiancé? Far from it, as you will see. And, Adrien Brody was hilarious as Salvador Dali, as in 'Dali!!!' and 'Rhinocerous!' That part was priceless.Gil as Woody(let's just use Woody OK?)met a couple of gorgeous women interested in a romance with him, one of them being the terminally cute Marion Cotillard(Adriana)on his visits to the 20's, and a sweet antique dealer in the present time. After finally resolving his life's troubles caused by his fiancé and by his many trips to his fantasy 20's world, Woody ended up as he should have with the right partner and the right life's direction, and apparently is still in Paris living happily ever after. Ah, if it all could be so grand and ending just as it should, as it always does in Woody's fantasies.",8,2,5,31 May 2011
Zodiac," I'll never buy another 3 cent stamp again!
","Anyone who gets the relevance of the above statement to one of the characters in Zodiac can continue reading. All others please go away. Just kidding, but John Carroll Lynch, who played the hulking and probable Zodiac murderer here also played Norm, the barely-above-comatose husband of police chief Marge Gunderson(Frances McDormond) in the great movie Fargo, and in Fargo he played the winning artist of the federal 3 cent stamp competition. How much better does life get than winning that, I ask you? Anyway, he graduated to playing the ominous serial killer here, but that fact was unproved technically(but proved well enough for me). Lynch is a very good character actor seen often on film and TV in widely diverse roles, even cops.Good film, a little long in story development, and tedious in the obsessive Graysmith part(J. Gyllenhaal)from the midpoint on, as to me he was the least interesting one of the 3 main characters hunting or writing about Mr. Z. The main case cop Dave Toschi(Mark Ruffalo), and ace crime reporter Paul DeVry(the very terrific Robert Downey, Jr. here)were much more interesting, if not as zealous in their very long term pursuit of the Z as was the fanatical and never-say-die Graysmith, a cartoonist for the SF Chronicle(which of course made him imminently qualified to research and write a book on the Zodiac murders....Not!) I am not making this up, folks, as we all know that truth is stranger than fiction, and especially where the Zodiac was concerned all bets were off. I live in the SF Bay Area and know how off-the-wall the SFChron can be at times, so putting a cartoonist on the case may not be too unusual for the Chron.Well acted film overall in a good story, with Gyllenhaal seeming a bit of a weenie in his Graysmith role. He was portrayed as soft and sensitive but a real bulldog with a bone when it came to finding out who Z really was, and he never quit until the job was finished, for me, but again, not technically and legally. This horrible case ruined, or nearly ruined the careers and health of all 3 of these men, and the film showed that harsh deterioration well also.Great inside view of police work, OK, police work Hollywood style, but it was interesting to see the many official gears working to solve crimes even if it wasn't that scary/exciting, except when the Z was doing his dirty work.Great old '60's SF locations too; interesting to relive how our office workplaces used to look before high tech and computers took over everything.People loving good crime stories will like this film, but others wanting more action may be a bit bored as it is a very long film with lots of suspense but little action.",8,4,11,6 March 2007
Hotel Rwanda," san ramon ca
","This is a fine film, with an especially moving portrayal by Don Cheadle. He never lost his humility nor his humanity through all the horrific experiences any 10,000 people would hope not to see in their lifetimes.Very moving scenes of love, hate, corruption, and abject unconcern with the suffering of others. All too human in all respects. All film tech aspects were expert, and the thousands of extras never looked staged. Just excellent all around and very moving.Here comes the .....'but'. Not a critique of the film but of the base cause of this problem around the world. There is now way too many people for the earth's land to carry, and little or no birth control in Africa to control the numbers that will be born and then uselessly die through warfare and/or famine and disease, as this film's subject will happen again over and over. What will get population under control outside of warfare and genocide? Will it be so crowded that we will eventually have to ask permission of the person next to us in order to be able to turn around??? And what if he says ....'no'! Before it even gets to this horrid state, great masses will be killed in warfare all over the world just like that depicted in this film. That is what will happen when our uncontrolled world population hits critical mass within the next 100 years, and you all know it will happen, just not exactly when, and most probably sooner than later. We see it coming, and do nothing about it. So tragic, and so stupid, as it is avoidable. When nothing to help is done, what happens in this film will happen, and not just in Africa.",Null,1,1,31 January 2005
Once," For lovers, good music lovers and good film lovers
","A very simple, but roughly elegant and charismatic story of a poor busker in Dublin striving to make it in the UK folk/rock music biz, and of his short but very sweet interlude with a musically talented eastern European immigrant girl who helps him with his music but also has her own musical vision. His vision is different and much more ambitious, whereas hers is more familial, personal and introspective. Even though they differed greatly in their need for and of artistic expression, sensitive and unselfish gratitude was shown on both sides for the help they gave each other on the way.Great Frames music throughout, as the soulfulness and pain of love is expressed so tenderly and sensitively, but with great power, by the impressive lead singer of The Frames, Glen Hansard. In real life, The Frames fly well under the huge radar of that 'other' Irish group U2, but it also has its own charisma working well here in Hansard's music. Just excellent songwriting and singing in a perfect blending of Hansard's talents. I was very impressed with him and enjoyed the story and his music immensely(bought the soundtrack).From our typical expectations at film's end, it just proves so well how much Hollywood has influenced us about romantic movie endings as we all wanted the two leads to get together at the end. Life is not Hollywood, and thank heaven for that. As a result, it was a much more realistic story.My best 3 films of the year so far in this order....Waitress, Ratatoille, and Once. All 9's and 10's, and far above anything else; see all of them for a real treat.",9,3,5,10 July 2007
Crash," Tough subject to get right; this film did
","Crash let us know right away that it was not going to be an easy film to watch, with the characters essentially fighting each other in racial struggles sometimes to the death. The racial struggle is still inconclusive in America, and probably in the entire world, and we still don't know for sure how it will turn out. Will we survive it? Crash tried to give us a hint of hope that we may.Crash tried to show that even though some might fear or even hate others for being different than them, we still need each other often in order to deal with life's many issues and problems. That should be the lesson...we do need each other, and emergencies like those shown in the film are the great equalizers...we are all in the same need in those situations, no matter who helps us, and we should be very grateful to those who do help us no matter what their color.Don Cheadle is rapidly becoming a star who takes over a film from other actors, even though most did a good job, especially Matt Dillon, Terrance Howard, and even Sandra Bullock who really surprised me with her ability. Cheadle was again wonderful as he usually is, and was very soulful as a world-weary cop with a junkie mom and criminal brother riding on his overburdened shoulders.Matt Dillon's tough/gentle cop character showed the realistic changes a person can make when thrown into conflicting situations evoking the opposite emotions of anger and compassion...one time he was an angry brute bent on cruelty, the next time a gentle and compassionate rescuer of the same person he earlier brutalized. And he was a loving son too. Just like all the rest of us can be in different life situations.Terrance D. Howard, who has a great face and looks a lot like a black Benicio del Toro, was a standout. He was an Oreo entertainment exec hot shot in the early going and he wimped out shamefully in a tough racial situation involving his wife and a white cop, but his character came through later with some real backbone when he felt pushed hard enough to take a stand against perceived racial profiling and persecution by the police.Stereotypes are with us because, as shown in this film, a lot of them are based on truths or half-truths, but are just plain wrong when applied to individuals. Crash showed well how wrong all races can be by pigeon-holing others into convenient niches that fit their own built-in prejudices. Sometimes it even killed them.Great night shots of LA and wonderful film technicals throughout, using very clever cutaways that seamlessly melded one scene's end into the start of a totally different scene. Very slick and effective. The only false stretch for me was that it is realistically an impossibility for all the different characters in the film to run into each other so often in 12 million-people strong L.A. That just couldn't happen, but it made for a very interesting and fantastic drama, if not always a totally realistic one.",9,0,8,20 May 2005
The Town," Best movie of the year so far for me
","Ben Affleck has hit full stride with this taut, scary crime thriller. All aspects ring so true, from the superb caper planning and preparation to the actual caper timing and interactions with victims to after the caper is done and the money is in hand and causing all kinds of divisive thoughts and actions. The ensemble acting was uniquely superb overall, and that shows so true that Ben conveyed exactly what he wanted from the cast, the surest sign of a great director, and a resulting great film.The best lesson to be learned from this terrific film, if one is learned, is that abjectly insular upbringings such as those shown in the Irish Charlestown section of Boston, are almost totally determining of most people's eventual fate if a fierce and unshakable attitude is not taken to get out and thus eliminate those strait-jacket forces holding one back from liberating self-improvement. That it is exactly the same in Harlem, East L.A, or Bensonhurst is proof positive of its eventual destructive nature. The same can be said of a religious or drunken or drugged or parentally self-absorbed household/community or any other form of severely constricting environment. One must get out forever to fully realize one's true self and destiny.This film was much more to me than a crime caper. It was a crucial human lesson in how to correct an unfortunate circumstance of birth, that of being forced into a restrictive corner in life due to being born in a certain place. When that happens, everyone must do as Ben did in this story..........work your a$$ off to get out no matter what it costs temporarily. It will pay off in the end much more than any caper ever could, and that is what I thought was the most important message in this terrific film.",9,3,7,24 September 2010
Lion," Liked it, but overly sentimental
","Liked the India part way best, with little Saroo lost and bewildered trying to get home. In Tasmania, to me, the story faltered and was inconsistent with a lot of logic and story flow flaws. Not getting overwhelmed by emotion, I looked for the bits and pieces that told a complete story of a lost kid's almost divine rescue from probable tragedy. Little Sunny was great as Little Saroo, and Dev Patel was good as older Saroo. Nicole Kidman was also really good as his adoptive mom.As an internet researcher, I found that older Saroo was not very good at connecting the dots in order to find his home and his Mum in India. If I did it, first I would best figure how far he traveled by time and train speed, find a town name that was closest to what he remembered it to be, find if it had a water tower, then a covered rail station, sited next to woods and a rock quarry, on and on. Wouldn't take long, certainly not as long as it took him, so that was a very weak part to me, but it added to movie drama, of course. And, I must allow that he was delayed in his search by his dreams progressively telling him more details about his childhood home that led him further into his search.Sorry to get so scientific about such an emotional movie, but I saw too many realism flaws to make it a more rewarding story to me in the second half. And, after I saw the harshness of poor India the closest thing I had to an tearful emotional moment was..........God Bless America.",7,2,5,29 December 2016
Gone Baby Gone," No good deed goes unpunished
","At the end................what a moral dilemma! The end of this smart film will not be revealed here but it is the kind that has you thinking and talking for days after. Ben Affleck's directorial debut shows he has the right stuff for stories set in his childhood area of South Boston, as he hits all the right notes to me except for two in this gritty, grim and non-smiling story about child abduction, a situation that is getting to be as common as roadside trash in our rapidly declining society.The poor white working class characters of South Boston were shown in all their lack of glory, as downtrodden a folk as you will see anywhere in the country, city or rural. Poverty, obesity and other physical repulsiveness(and not just the people),decay, trash, and trashiness were everywhere and in nearly everyone there, and set the scene well for the very harsh tale to follow. Ben's brother Casey was very good in his starring role as a private detective hired to help solve the kidnapping. He is short on emotional range, but that usually fatal defect in an actor actually became a positive in this very serious role, as after much violence and deception, he finally solves the confusing riddle of convolution created by the terrific Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman in their pivotal cop roles involving the kidnapping of the 4 year old daughter of a drug addict single mom, played by the accomplished stage actress, Amy Ryan.Amy Ryan was mostly very effective overall in her druggie/mom from hell role, but her poised body language learned for the stage was not realistic compared to the slumped over, beaten down body language of the addicts I have seen. But, she did convey well the repulsiveness of the poor white underclass, using gross denial, insult, disrespect, and abject irresponsibility and foul language to the hilt, and was especially upsetting when we saw a 'mother' like her repulsive self 'raising' an innocent daughter who would surely pay, along with society, in many hard ways over the years for the sins of her horribly flawed mother. If she was lucky enough to live through it, that is.Another nagging problem was that Casey's Dudly DoRight character was very conflicted at the end about the dilemma discussed below, but not at all about taking the law into his own hands earlier and making a decision that is only the state's right to make. Extreme moral right and criminal wrong in the same person?.....just like many of the rest of us probably, but disturbing here in that his lawless deed was so in contrast with the rigidly self-righteous stance he took at the end.Michelle Monaghan was gorgeous and terrific as Affleck's smart and aware girlfriend and business associate and, to me, had the correct opinion of what should have happened in the end. It all boiled down to this......yes, what happens to one child, good or bad, will not change the world much I understand well, but the growing collective evil in the world has to be questioned and examined by all of us when it is seen to grow by the choices we all voluntarily make in our lives that we think are right at the time. So, is traditional moral right always the best solution for any problem? Or, compared to strict traditional moral right, is what is best for one child at a time the practical best answer overall for that child and for society even if it contrasts with traditional moral right?That is the very tough issue all responsible viewers will give much thought to upon seeing this film. See it...and think hard about the problem. It's a crucial issue in our decaying society, and Ben Affleck showed it here in as convincing yet entertaining a way as anyone could show it in film. But, don't expect a feel-good Hollywood ending as there was nothing of the kind, and I applaud Affleck for making that choice here. One of the best films of the year so far.",9,2,6,29 October 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
","Yeah, maybe, if it doesn't wear you down so much that you die an old man at 40. Bourne had as much physical activity in this film as a typical person has in a lifetime, so dying at 40 doesn't seem too young for him. No sleep, constant travel, running, fighting, shooting, tension, worry, no love, no sex, etc. ...it made me need a nap just watching it. That said, I enjoyed the totally unrealistic chase throughout, as it was just one long and glorified chase flick, with top non-stop action and technicals...the first non-stop action film I've seen, even though Live Free or Die Hard came close. Bourne had to snuff tough assassins wholesale, avoid supernatural surveillance electronics(no one really thinks that stuff exists, do they? If so, get real. That was the gov't, folks.), resist one potential sexual encounter, and stay on his one-track-mind pursuit all the way to the 'end'. What a job, and who could ever have the fitness and energy for all that? But, what fun it all was to watch.Matt Damon was at his stone-faced best, and the great Joan Allen as a CIA sub-boss nearly stole the show and still looks great and so trim. David Strathairn as the evil CIA boss was OK, but no way would the real CIA ever let a HQ headman have hair that long. Why do filmmakers let actors keep their hair the way they have it when they show up for filming when it is not realistic for the role? Details, details.More detail nitpicks department: why do you think the filmmaker had to tell us(ignorant dopes?)each time in writing when the action went to these cities, that Paris is in France, London is in England, and Madrid is in Spain? Maybe he thought we might mistake unforgettable views of the Paris skyline for that of Paris, Texas? Jeez, even people from Texas know better than that. Maybe.Entertaining movie overall, even if 99% of it was unreal fantasy. These days, movie cartoons are live action films with real people playing the cartoon parts, but make no mistake, they are still cartoons. Bugs Bunny...eat your heart out!",8,1,3,20 August 2007
Nightcrawler," Jake is beyond creepy here
","The most suspenseful film of the year to date. It was mesmerizing to watch writer/director Dan Gilroy's shocking portrayal of a psychopath calmly doing the very dangerous and criminal things that exited him no end but would leave a normal person senseless and useless. The story and format of the film has been discussed so I will concentrate on the very engrossing way the story told about Louis Bloom(Jake Gyllenhaal) and the very scary way he lived his new-found dream(nighcrawling TV sensationalist 'news')and why he was so successful at it when we are all told that psychopathy is a severe mental disease with no cure and no hope of a normal life. In this film story it was so well shown to be the opposite in this story, as the psychopath Louis Bloom not only did well, he prospered greatly by living his crazy but carefully calculated life without the personal care, caution and integrity that most of of us try to live by. Nothing mattered to him but his work, and big success from it, as all people were mere pawns used for his game, even if it killed them. His all-engrossing intensity during 'the chase' and accompanying car chase of each story was mesmerizing to watch. You will not forget Louis easily after seeing this film. Nightmares may result. Watch your neighbor carefully.The denouement suspense was without equal, the car chases were wonderfully shot in nighttime L.A., especially the last one that ended in tragedy(but not to Louis, of course, he loved it). And, the final, nearly sexual climax conversational interplay between Louis and the TV station news director, so well played by Rene Russo, gave us real insight into the distorted emotions and greed that drives these deranged types to want to show such gruesomely graphic and sensationalist stories as the lead-in stories for their 'newscasts'. Winning at any cost, of course, was their only goal. Nothing else mattered, certainly not truth, facts, obeying the law, or even human decency.The film was hard to watch at times, and it will leave you creeped out at the end but also entirely satisfied that you just saw a great and original film story with great acting. Don't miss it.",9,3,5,26 November 2014
28 Weeks Later," Too many stupid story blunders
","Terrific potential unrealized here, as a possibly good apocalypse story was ruined by stupid storytelling/film-making. Like this.....an unbelievably dumb military mistake caused all the later problems for civilization after the virus problem had been totally contained. The rage virus had been contained, yes, but through its moronic mistake the military allowed the virus out to ravage the world again, this time probably for good. Others have detailed the film story so I'm not going to; I am going to critique it hard as it sure deserves it.The unrealistic story mistake that ruined everything was: why wasn't the infected wife guarded AT ALL BY ANYONE after she was diagnosed with the virus and strapped down on a gurney in a supposedly 'secure' quarantine room. Her uninfected husband walked unseen right into her room, no guards anywhere, and was promptly infected by his wife's kiss.... The possible end of humanity if she escaped and NO GUARDS ANYWHERE GUARDING HER to prevent it? Have I made that goof entirely clear? The newly-infected husband then ran right out of the entire building with no one at all seeing him, or anything! Incredible, and so stupid as to be beyond belief. But, I guess it had to happen to keep the filmmaker's senseless mayhem going but it should have been done much smarter, like have the husband sneak past guards going in or overpower and infect the guards coming out or at least something halfway smart! I lost all interest at that dumb point and knew it would be a stupid film. It was.After the mistake that probably ended the world later, the military decides it would be real smart to lay total waste to the entire city to kill all the people infected by the husband AFTER he escaped due to the military's dumb mistake. It was made very clear that the military is good at killing lots of people(innocent and uninfected victims were also killed)afterward but it can't guard a single infected one properly. This showed what the military does best... kill, as it sure didn't use any brainpower(military intelligence?) to prevent lots of killing later.More totally stupid things: the infected husband follows his kids around London as they run this way and that trying to escape the infected ones, but then he tries to infect them as soon as he gets a chance. What happened to the father's suggested paternal instinct(why would he follow ONLY them?) but that hope was cheaply sacrificed for the sake of infecting his son to ruin the world later, and then he got shot by his daughter as he tried to infect her. Another bad decision by the filmmaker was that the soldier leading the escape group to supposed safety couldn't shoot any more civilians due to moral problems with it, but he could readily kill his own soldier comrade without a problem to help the group escape? What happened to his morals there? This film story was so dumb, purely in order to move the horror along no matter how unreasonable it was...'just make it scary, don't worry if it's stone dumb, they'll never know the difference'! There were other mile wide holes in the story I could tell, but you get the picture of how bad it was.This was a dumb movie made for and by dopes, with easily seen, gaping holes in its gaping holes, as it pushed the same gory sensationalism scene after scene with no attempt at good, intelligent and tight storytelling. Forget it, and quickly. Just awful. If this is what passes for smart entertainment with the youth of today, God help us.",3,9,22,11 May 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Cute summer fare
","LMS is a good summer-quality movie with most of the humor in goofy sight gags occurring on the family's long and trouble-filled road-trip. The real fun was in the goofy characters and their many Keystone Kops antics. Greg Kinnear did a great job as The Dad, as his straight-as-an-arrow American Dad looks made him the perfect straight man all the others played off of for laughs. He was annoyingly funny as an unsuccessful, 9 step program motivational speaker, and he drove the family nuts by spouting his 9-steps whenever the family found itself in crunch after crunch on their trip, as he dimwittedly believed that following his 9 steps would solve any problem. Thus, he was the chosen family doofus as they travelled from New Mexico to L.A. in an quirky(typical)VW bus, where they intended to enter their daughter in a really tacky, little girl beauty contest. Those nauseating contests really do exist, believe it or not. The hilarious Alan Arkin played the off-the-wall, heroin-addicted, and profane grandpa to the hilt as usual, and Tony Collette as the wife and her very odd, vow-of-silence son were good too. But Steve Carell of The Office was outstanding as the morose, suicidally gay uncle taken along on the trip so the family could keep him from killing himself over a failed job and romance. His acidly sardonic remarks were some of the film's best moments. But their 7 year-old Little Miss Sunshine contestant daughter was the real star of this movie. She was a natural and showed just the right spunk and guts for a beauty contest entrant, even though the choice of her talent act reflected more of her sex-obsessed grandpa rather than her normal little girl self.Sounds really sick, but it was funny in context. I did wonder afterward why our national child protective services didn't comment about the provocative sexual content in her act as it related to a little girl, but guess they considered it 'humor' and not serious enough to make a fuss about. But, the creepy pedophile in the contest audience was truly scary, as he could have been based on reality. Uggh. Think of JonBenet Ramsey. But, aside from that, it was a very entertaining movie.",7,1,13,15 August 2006
Silver Linings Playbook," Best movie of 2012
","Been wondering all year when a truly good movie would show up, and this one is it. The subject matter of the mentally ill was not all that different or special, but what made this film special was the screenplay first and then the marvelous dead-on acting of the entire cast. Jennifer Lawrence will surely be the next big name in female actors, as she was so natural and real in her demanding role that you never saw the acting, just the character. Bradley Cooper played well the lead 'problem person' in this film of many, his riveting blue eyes nailing to the wall any he looked at and spoke to. Robert DeNiro, in yet another role as an off-center parent, was his terrific self in much more than just a supporting role as he was integral to story development.But, above it all was the truly great David Russell screenplay, as we have all seen stories with similar subject matter that were harmed or even ruined due to out of place and/or flat comedic elements and collective bad acting or a low quality script. This movie not only had the gravitas of truth and honesty in it that most don't have a clue about, but it also glowed from the very rare and intangible inner magic of a screen writing gem that resulted in an ensemble triumph most films would not even hope for, much less obtain.In your lifetime, if you have ever felt marginalized or on the sidelines or not really 'in' life due to personal issues, and that covers most of us at one time or another, do yourself a true favor and see this wonderful movie of initial anguish and despair that eventually becomes one of believable hope and triumph.",9,2,6,26 December 2012
Jarhead," Too much empty, not enough full
","A war film should be about the fighting. Why make it otherwise? Make something else. This one was all about the sidebars of war, not war action thus it left me wanting much more of the war action part and not what this film was about, which looked like all the director's outtakes put together. I could not get used to seeing our soldiers well prepared for battle and then not fighting the war they were trained to fight, instead fighting their own personal demons and new-age introspective 'issues'. How PC and touchy-feely the war 'situation' was in this film...no fighting, just personal 'issues'! The soldiers' personal life 'issues', and their waiting around, bickering, waiting around, intimidating, waiting around, digging foxholes in the sand, waiting around, heat and dust suffering, waiting around, walking around, etc. and other mostly boring in-between-the-actual-fighting filler material should lead to a great action payoff in any good war story, but this film did not pay off at all as it lead nowhere and ended nowhere near a good war action story(I was in the Army so I know a lot of being a soldier is waiting around, standing around, sitting around, marching around....all the time waiting for the big payoff to make up for the other very boring crap that the filmmaker thought was so important to show us for 2 effing hours.....but not to me!).So, in the future, if I ever get the urge to see another 'war' film about all the 'issues' stuff that goes on while the soldiers are not actually fighting, I'll beat myself over the head until the urge goes away and save myself 2 wasted hours. Or, see a great war movie like Saving Private Ryan for the 10th time!",4,0,1,18 April 2006
Dunkirk," More like a documentary than a dramatic film
","Not too much I liked about this film. Emotionless story for the most part, with mostly repetitive bombing and killing and a soundtrack that was deafening and unrelenting. The film's color was also washed out which bled any potential emotion from it. Character development was non-existent. Mostly scenes of scared to death young men trying to survive.Didn't like at all the 3 stories in one gimmicky approach to this important historical event. Scenes constantly jumped from one of the 3 stories to the another with no relationship to the last scene shown, only to the last scene of the same story shown earlier. Also, too much repetition and different angles of air attacks, with soldiers constantly in the water from bombings and too little of anything else that made Dunkirk the historical war icon that it is known to be. For example, in one scene it was disheartening and historically inaccurate to show one destroyer that didn't even fire a shot at a bomber that sunk it even as the plane was clearly visible from miles off. And, the many plane dog fights were too repetitive and did not look realistic for the most part. There were also too many scenes that looked 'off' in historical accuracy to me, one example being the one of soldiers in an abandoned boat on the beach, being shot at by an unseen shooter, but none of the soldiers were killed or even hit by the many bullets that pierced the boat's sides. Not one.The entire story and editing of the film annoyed me to the point that I ended up not caring much what happened at the end. That is never a good thing in a war movie. The different time lines of the 3 stories were more than disorienting at times as the film cut from story to story and back again, with all time in each......suspended. If this famous filmmaker wanted to make a documentary, he should have made one. What was missing was a dramatic movie. To me, bad form to mix the two but keep an emotion-starved, washed-out color, documentary style story throughout. This story could have been told and shown a lot better.",5,9,14,23 July 2017
Ratatouille," Second best movie of 2007 so far
","Only Waitress was a better film overall for me as it was real people, but Ratty was close, and both were great. Both were so original, inspired, visual, great stories, well acted, funny....all the good things that make us know movies can still can be great. Disney struck gold when Jobs sold it Pixar...the gift that just keeps on giving. Great entertainment to us, bags of money to Disney.What great voices, especially notable was Peter O'Toole as villain-turned-good guy Anton Ego..... he was perfectly egotistical and snobby as a scary food critic. The story...who doesn't like food? The inner workings of a busy French kitchen was fun and interesting. The animation showed continued tech improvement as nuances and shadings and physical movements are getting so much better and more realistic with tech advances. God is in the details in animation, that's for sure.Loved it throughout, if you could overlook all the kid chaos and noise in the theater on the first day. Any lesser film would have been disturbed by the incredible din. Everyone loved it, with much applause at the end.Do yourself a favor and see it in a theater. See the vast improvements in animation and color, but not just for that...see it for the great and touching story of a rat that appreciated great food over the garbage his friends and family liked, and due to that love he made sure he became a part of the haute cuisine world forever. We are all better off for it.See Waitress and Once also, if you haven't. All three are terrific films, and prove that summer fare doesn't have to be lame.",9,2,3,6 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," Very faithful to the book, and even better
","Writer Cormac McCarthy, he of few and common-man words in his latest books, weaves an anxious tale of West Texas crime, murder and deep mystery in this 'who's going to go down hard' tale of rabbit and coyote, one running and the other chasing relentlessly for nearly the entire film. The story is basically this: Drug deal goes real bad, outsider finds money and runs, drug dealer hires killer to find the money and deal harshly with the interloper and anyone getting in the way. And he does this at times in the most creative fashion by using a slaughterhouse stun gun, of all things. (No more storyline here, as it has been revealed in detail in other reviews.)The Coen Bros. nearly outdid their great success Fargo here, but humor mixed in with the mayhem and a classical musical score in Fargo made it a more satisfying story experience overall, IMO, than the almost pure evil and ill will toward innocent humanity that this story pounded at us relentlessly. And, as I remember it, there was no music at all in this film until the credits ran but that rare decision fit this harsh film well.The magnificent Spanish talent Javier Bardem played Anton Chigurh, the single-minded psychopathic killer hired to chase down Josh Brolin's interloper character Lewellyn Moss, and he was as scary in looks, words and practice here as any screen heavy ever, and was positively blood-chilling in his brilliance. Bardem is a real masterpiece, as in The Dancer Upstairs he played a good man to the bottom of his soul in the face of abject evil, and in this film he was the exact opposite and even more effective. Both jobs proved his immense range and talent and that he is unquestionably at the very top of the list of the most talented international actors working today and easily the most memorable character in this film full of good ones.Brolin's working class good looks and manner were perfect as a poor welder who found $2 million in drug money and a bunch of dead guys while he was out hunting antelope. He was just a regular guy living a meager life in a trailer with his overly dependent wife, who aggravatingly asked him endless and clueless questions in the way a 2 year old child does, and this found money represented his only way out of the deep hole he was in so he intended to do all it required to keep it. Tommy Lee Jones, who played Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in the middle of the chase to catch up to both Moss and Chigurh, was as downhome terrific as only he can be playing a leathery Texas character. As a very savvy, old school, near-retirement lawman, he knew from the start that he was overmatched in this case and was merely spitting upwind against the hurricane of modern drug crime, often wondering aloud why and how it all happened and befuddled him in the process. He was getting old and nearly irrelevant in modern drug crime casework and he knew it, but he still almost got the job done due to good fundamental police work. And, while almost shocking in its abruptness, the film's ending implied that much of the crime committed in today's complex and ruthless drug world is realistically impossible to solve. The opponent is just too rich, powerful and persistent, but also more willing to go to all out bloody war at all costs to win.As a result, if you need stories with feelgood Hollywood endings, see something else. But see this one if you want story and acting quality above all else.",9,2,5,26 November 2007
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," All action. No heart, no soul
","Wildly impossible but typical action flick of today, and lacking any character development in its break-neck race to the end credits. Tom is his usual inscrutable and unreadable, buffed-up MI self, always in mortal danger while careening under, over, around and through all obstacles and dangers to win the day that would kill a real man in seconds. Why have Superman when Tom does all day just about anything S-man could do? Ridiculous to show a mortal man surviving all that bodily damage, let alone prospering with no ill effects. Sorry, but this movie was no more than mindless, thrill-seeking action of the Stallone/Willis type, but sure seems to be just what some want today for their movie going dollar. Not me, as I actually like a real story with real people in it.The never-possible-in-a-trillion-years 'story' was all action, all the time, start to finish, no rest or sleep possible, but rang phony from the word go for the lack of humanity in its players. It was no more than a non-interactive video game that used human actors instead of CGI-created ones, but allowed them the superhuman actions and death-defying nature of CGI. Absurd genre to be sure, but one that really clicks with those wanting only physical and no mental. Read some other reviews here for proof of that.",5,5,12,26 December 2011
The Theory of Everything," Wanted more science
","But, as a life tragedy film, this was better than most. A Ron Howard-type, 1940s-style emotion-seeker using Dr. Hawking's sad illness for a center point, this story was very little about what made the man great in his field, and almost all about what made him such a force of mind and will while enduring a physical illness that felled most others with it early on. Living on for decades beyond expectations showed the results of that great will along with the long-suffering, loving care his wife showered upon him for all those years of indignity and degenerative insult. To show his brutal struggle's accomplishments as well as the film showed them was grand and very encouraging to behold, but I truly wish the film had shown more of what made him so heroic in his field as well as in his illness. Thus, the film failed in that for me.Eddie Redmayne as Hawking was outstanding, as his amazing physical similarities were only overshadowed by his uncanny ability to portray Hawking's illness's effect on his body and face as he declined. Felicity Jones as his loving and caring and so enduring wife, was also outstanding, as the fierce will and love she showed in her role was surely as strong as Mrs. Hawking showed in real life.Don't expect much of Hawking's science in this film, as it has just enough in it to engage us about Hawking's life mission, which is the title of the film. He is still working on it, and I am sure that is what is keeping him alive for the rest of us to someday benefit.",6,1,2,8 December 2014
The Lives of Others," Probably the best film of 2006
","Even though The Departed may be judged by most to be more powerful and shocking, this film shocks but it also saddens, and then encourages the heart in a unique way that senses-bludgeoning films like The Departed cannot...in the inexorable and certain life-draining way that only stories detailing the harsh realities of a life without hope can do, and then which show a complete about face and tell the resulting story of total transformation and its effects on the same people. Always difficult to do, but was done with brilliance in this film.Most of this film was about people's unhappy lives without hope under Socialism, but then come the transformations, individual and national, that change everything. This film develops the story of dreary but threatening communist 'hope oppression' better than any I can remember since the '50's film, '1984'. Without hope to encourage us, what else is there to the real value of life? The very soulful and talented Urich Muhe(his features hint of Kevin Spacey) plays the role of a hardened national police captain who is the central screw on which the story turns, a totally committed socialist party cop who undergoes a complete, but not overtly joyful, change of heart that works to alter forever the fortunes of the story's foil, a writer/playwright of increasingly 'questionable' political views who, as a result, becomes a central target of the Stasi, the national security police that was shown to be ubiquitous and all-powerful, and every bit as formidable and scary as the outrageously inhuman 'Big Brother' that terrified citizens in '1984'.Early on, Muhe played the police captain as a Jack Webb/Joe Friday-type cop.....humorless, cold, stiff and ruthlessly committed to doing the best but also the meanest job he could do in a mean business to root out any and all political dissenters. Muhe's role interpretation in his gradual but complete transformation to the other side personally and politically was nothing less than acting brilliance, and probably the best acting of the year in any film. Don't miss it, as you will be missing rare acting greatness if you do, and at least the equal to the brilliance of Massimo Triosi in Il Postino.Also, along with the greatest movie-ending lines in history, the very last line in this film summed up everything that happened before in the best and fewest words possible, and it will surely move you greatly, not only from immense sadness and pity for what happened to the disgraced former cop but also from great hope and gratitude for the people in this world who finally see the true light as did Muhe's transformed police captain, and then put it to work bettering the world even though the personal cost may be great. An heroic act of course, but even more, one worthy of emulation by all of us.'The Lives of Others' was so emotionally powerful throughout but nearly overwhelming at the end, as it showed so well one of the greatest life-lessons that can be learned by anyone, and one never to be forgotten....some of your good deeds will be rewarded in some way.(added 1/23/08: one of the best movies and lead role acting in decades. Urich Muhe died recently, and what a tragic loss of talent and person. His death makes me also sadly grieve the similar fates of the magnificent Massimo Triosi of Il Postino, and the creative genius Adrienne Shelley of Waitress....both also died much too young right after their highly acclaimed triumphs in those films.)",9,6,8,12 March 2007
The Incredibles," Way over-hyped, and not very funny
","Pixar has seemingly regressed in its computer animation technology with this film as it had a stiff, flat, washed out, pastel look reminiscent of Toy Story many years ago. Not at all the great and vibrant colors of Finding Nemo, nor those of a competitor, Shrek 2. Maybe it was an older film just now released? ('To heck with making it great, just rake in the big bucks from the boneheads now!!!')Anyway, the film was Hollywood animation-film formula all the way so I fell asleep, which I do in boring movies. Everything was so predictable...storyline, jokes, action, rescue, insults, ending, etc. Been there, done that many times. It was also 20 minutes overlong and dragged badly in the middle, and needed some good story editing to sharpen it up all the way through. It was very Ho-hum to me all the way and a mediocre effort at best. I generously give it a C-.It's OK for kids and those others who think all animated films are just super great, but not much for one who thinks animation and its stories should stand up well against other film types, which this one doesn't do well.",Null,1,2,8 November 2004
The Illusionist," Sepia-toned period thriller
","I enjoyed this beyond-magic thriller a lot, even though the ending was pretty easily determined ahead of time by any Conan Doyle aficionado of Sherlock Holmes mysteries due to close similarities to at least two of his stories. But, the film was so well done that it more or less overshadowed that obvious bit of copy-cat that gave the film a Sherlock Holmes mystery look and feel, and especially due to all the horse-and-buggy clop-clopping through the old city streets. I fully expected Sherlock to emerge from a buggy at any time, hot on the trail of the perp.The sepia-toned filter used in all scenes gave it a perfect touch of faded age, and the Prague locations used provided the necessary quaint but regal 19th Century look of golden years class that few cities today can provide for horse and buggy age films. The film had a look of quality and class throughout and was mostly very accurate in its period details.Edward Norton was terrific in his usual inscrutable-faced way as the magical illusionist carrying out his own illusion of a 'murder' mystery, and Paul Giamatti continued to amaze me with his growing virtuosity in another demanding character piece, this time as a deadly serious but role-conflicted police chief trying to solve the Big mystery, more for his own satisfaction in the end than to bring the perps to eventual justice. The Scarlett Johannson-lipped Jennifer Biel was innocently effective as the main squeeze, but Rufus Sewell was a bit much and over the top in his overtly vicious villain role as the emperor's scheming nut-case son. Amusingly, his obviously fake mustache made me watch it in amazement all the time instead of watching him as he progressively chewed the scenery throughout his crazed evolution from a quietly jealous and pompous royal ass to a violently drunken and murderous maniac. Who else noticed his really bad fake mustache and why didn't the director catch it? Most of the reviews here are very enthusiastic and are mostly well deserved as it was a fine film, but if you know Sherlock Holmes' stories well you will have the ending figured out far before it actually ends and that will away take a bit of your overall enjoyment.",8,1,2,25 September 2006
Children of Men," Grey, grim, gritty and depressing, as it should be
","I won't tell the story of the film as others do over and over, but I will offer a commentary.In this gritty and harsh end-of-the-world-coming film there were too many unexplained reasons for everything bad that had happened/was happening to the world for me to say this was a great movie, but it did have its very effective moments if you could look past its story holes, inconsistencies and oversights. It is true that harsh, apocalyptic films like this one are tough to watch, but are absolutely necessary for all of us to see many times from this point on, as people worldwide do not respond to subtle messages about our environment, pollution, war, and global warming so they must be hit in the face by a story like this one regularly to show what can/could happen to us if we don't wake up and stop the world-killing atrocities that we are committing against other humans and to the earth. The film story left out the causes of the horrible state of the earth and concentrated on the effects of these atrocities, which were truly horrible to witness. All of it was very shocking, as something like it really could and may happen.The story of getting a mother and child, the only one in the world, out of England to someplace secret to perhaps provide a chance for humans to start anew, was your typical chase story with all the typical suspense, pitfalls, threats, violence and mayhem along the way. Nothing too unusual or different there. The ending was the hope the filmmaker gave us. But, what would that baby girl do later to save our species even if she escaped? Any possibility for the future hinged on finding a fertile male somewhere, but no babies had been born for many years so what were the chances of that? Would they try to use frozen sperm from an earlier and fertile time? No questions like this one were ever posed or answered.The impact of the obvious 'baby Jesus' scene near the end was very forceful, as it represented the filmmaker's idea of perhaps the only chance at a new beginning for our human-screwed-up-world in 2027, just as Jesus' birth was hoped to be 2000 years earlier. That powerful scene showed the immense reverence and amazement of even the military, which briefly ceased its vicious attack on insurgents as the mother and baby passed by. It was like a 2x4 slamming into your head as it made its point of, 'this baby is perhaps the only chance for human survival!'.I had a problem with story inaccuracies, as in its technical representations everything.....the tanks, guns, cars, clothing and even TV's showed no improvements over those around today and in many cases they were worse. No progress there, so the problems shown were obviously around for many years, perhaps since 2007? No clue, no answers. Also, if the country was in such chaos, why were the roads everywhere passable without roadblocks? Where did they get fuel? And, how did everyone eat, sleep, work, make money to live on, etc.? No good explanations were given for any of that. The film just wanted us to accept what it showed and concentrate on the devastation and human depravity. But I needed a more full and complete story of the social mess and its causes, and this wasn't one so I was left with too many unanswered questions that should have been answered.This movie has been out a week and hardly anyone was in the theater, so it probably won't make a profit.... depressing and/or apocalyptic films, even though foretelling an impossible or even somewhat hopeful future for us, usually don't make money. We just don't want to face what we have done and what may result from it so we stay away.",7,3,5,16 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Good but not great
","I liked MDB but not as much as some did. It portrayed the gritty boxing gym scene OK in parts, but had some glaring boxing technical mistakes or oversights that bothered me. Why didn't Eastwood run the film for boxing technical advisors before the final cut? Oh, well. But it did convey the emotion and drama of 'fight night' pretty well, however Eastwood's very spare acting and direction have gotten quite threadbare for me over the years, and often I wish for a bit more emotional 'ooomph' in his films. I get kinda weary of the Joe Friday, 'just the facts, maam', school of acting and direction so typical of Eastwood.Swank was terrific in her role but too was way too angelic and saintly for real life as a vicious knockout fighter, Freeman didn't ring true for today when he did not take any offense at all when called the N-word over and over by a mentally defective, wannabe fighter, and Eastwood was not terribly convincing as he vastly underplayed his role as a crusty and irritable trainer and manager. But the film did make a creditable attempt to show that sometimes a life just may be worth dying for certain people in certain situations, especially after a tragedy takes 99% of it from them beforehand. Very controversial issue in America's 'just say no to assisted suicide' position of today.Not nearly as good a film as Sideways, but worthy.",Null,1,5,10 February 2005
Garden State," A film for Seinfeld lovers
","A film about....nothing, just like Seinfeld, but not funny like Seinfeld often was. To me, over 40, this talkathon boredom factory was a total waste of time. No plot, no nothing. Just immature yak, yak, yak. Probably the most boring film I've seen since Haiku Tunnel(maybe not that bad). Made for GenXers, and should be seen by only GenXers. Only those types will understand it, I guess, and that is their big problem(and the world's!). I must admit that Natalie Portman was terrific in it but she was wasted in this junk, and even she could not save it from imploding in upon its formless, shapeless hulk. There was just no 'there' there.I gave up on it after an hour, so don't know how it ended, and who cares? See Sideways a hundred times and it still would be more interesting than this flop.",2,3,7,15 March 2005
Prisoners," Great story, but many flaws
","Prisoners was a gritty and engaging, child kidnap film that got our attention early and kept it until the end. However, it had many needless quirks and meaningless distractions and misdirections that it was difficult at times to follow what was necessary to the story and what was not. The highlight of the film was Hugh Jackman's character Keller, the stressed-out and angry father of one of two kidnapped little girls in Conyers, Georgia. This father's anger over losing his little girl drove the story and gave it its powerful energy that had all eyeballs glued to the screen throughout, which is the true +mark of a successful suspense story.Bad weather prevailed in this gloomy story that was so full of uncaring, devious and sick human behavior that it almost made you ashamed to be one of the same species. The entire cast did a very effective job, Maria Bello as Keller's depressive wife, Paul Dano as the uber-creepy suspect nearly tortured to death, Melissa Leo as his psychopathic aunt/mother(?), Terrence Howard as a soft and sensitive black man and neighbor whose child was also taken, and Viola Davis as his so sad, grieving wife. Jake Gyllenhaal was Loki, the also sad but serious and dedicated case detective whose outward bland calm was belied by an eye-blinking facial tick that well showed the giant stress he was constantly under to solve the case for his incompetent and pushy, but very antagonistic and unhelpful, captain.As the story has been detailed by others, my concern was for the details in the telling of the story. The first half of the film was terrific and built the story effectively and emotionally, but the second half had so many unnecessary twists and incomplete explanations of what really happened that it left me with a feeling of 'that could have been done much better'.I had the case figured out much faster than Loki did, as he missed the main clue from an earlier murder that would have solved the case if he were a better and 'more observant' detective(isn't that their job?). That he missed it was the main flaw in the story to me, but I was also irked at the case conclusion that was merely flashed too-briefly in newspaper headlines. That part left me with.....'That's it?' IMO, it was a too-quick and unsatisfying resolution to the long and harrowing, two and a half hour film story. However, the cut-off ending of the film that others have complained about was very impactful even if what led to it was tipped off earlier, thus very predictable.All in all, great acting in a flawed but very interesting and foreboding film story made my rating of it a strong 7. Warning... bloody human torture scenes and violent psychopathic behavior.",7,1,4,23 September 2013
Into the Wild," Like Grizzly Man in his naive love of wildness
","A disturbingly interesting film directed by Sean Penn, and very true to the original book. We all can relate to the true story lead character Chris McCandless(he changed his name to Alexander Supertramp for his sojourns), innocent, naive and youthfully stupid as we all were at that age, expecting the whole world and it's peoples to be our friend and nurturer and helpfully allow us to create a personal Utopia. Sadly, when we finally grow up, we see life doesn't turn out that way. It's filled with a lot of hard work and compromises, which we start to see realistically somewhere in our mid-20's or so. Alex didn't get old enough to see that truth, as he and Grizzly Man met the same fate due to poor judgement coming from just being young and dumb, and not seeing that their youthful utopian world view must be adjusted, compromised and modified greatly in order to live successfully later on in this world. Even most 60's hippies(the smart ones) who did the same vagabond thing saw that eventually. It seems to be human nature for the young to never seem to gain much insight from the previous generation's experiences even though they are basically very similar down through the ages.Just like those 60's hippies, Alex hit the road as a vagabond and fell into many interesting adventures with oddball characters along the way. The story had all the usual trite causative and motivational bells and whistles behind it....bad parents(bad I guess because they were rich and successful)who did fight a lot, a cloyingly close sister(Hmmmm)who narrated the story, a liberal college degree, and no money problems at all growing up that may have protected him from the more practical world and life views of the less fortunate.Thus the eventual Supertramp wanderer developed a serious hate of our capitalistic system(anything better out there?), and decided to live his life as a road tramp, working temp only when he needed the hated dollar in order to live and travel, and eventually get enough savvy and $$$ to get to Alaska where all the best things in life resided(in his mind)........beautiful scenery, wilderness, living off the land, no people, no need for money.........but also, 45 below zero winters, little natural food, no sufficient shelter(an old, uninsulated school bus in the middle of nowhere?), no one to talk to or love(he seemed asexual anyway), flooded rivers hemming him in so he couldn't go anywhere else much of the time. As he went to Alaska mostly unprepared for anything bad that could happen, it's too bad Chris didn't see a film like this one to discourage him before he went there and paid for for it with his life.Emile Hirsch did a great job in the role of Supertramp, as he had the air of innocent confidence that Chris obviously had in order to undertake such a journey. Also, great road characters abounded in the film story, with Vince Vaughn and Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook showing off as, respectively, a funny and sympathetic South Dakota farmer... a loving, aging hippie vagabond and flea market rat.... and an old desert-rat retiree who developed intense fatherly feelings for Chris and knew that Chris was headed for a bad ending. All helped and cared for Chris along the way as he prepared for his great and final Alaska adventure. The film had many beautiful scenes throughout of skies, deserts, rivers, mountains, tundra and ......of course......beautiful, but deadly Alaska for the unprepared.I read the book so I knew the ending..... and just as in Grizzly Man, a lot of naive and emotionally-driven mistakes can get you killed, even if they seemed good at the time. Penn showed all of this well in his film and I recommend it, but don't go if you want a feel-good Hollywood ending, as it definitely does not have it.",7,1,3,10 October 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I liked this film for about the first 20 minutes,
","then it became a jumbled, confused, and yes, tortured mess that did not know where to go or how to get there.  The middle part, which was the memory erasure part, was over an hour long and was way too long and boring and convoluted, with terrible and choppy editing, as the story and the director seemed stuck, as in Groundhog Day, and didn't know what to do next to get out of it.  Not well done at all, and it sure tortured me. Groundhog Day was a great film, by the by, and far superior to this flop.More emphasis on the differences and similarities between the two separate relationships of the same two people would have been a great improvement and would have saved the film.  Also, how others interacted with them in the two relationships, and how the two leads related to these people would have worked well too.  The film became so unworldly and screwball that it lost its humanity and love until a conventional  formula Hollywood ending 'saved' it(for the box office).Also, why did the filmmaker think that sloppy and careless Gen-Xer slackers with bad hair, hygiene, clothes, and personal behavior would be the best ones to do the critical memory erasing jobs???  Absolutely no credibilty there, and surely was done because the filmmaker is obviously 'one of them''. I say, Booshwah to that.Spend your money somewhere else, you'll be glad you did. This film is going nowhere and will be another failure for Carrey.",4,3,8,19 March 2004
Elysium," Began intelligently, ended stupidly
","Good story premise of an artificial planet, Elysium, where only the rich and otherwise privileged live in the mid-21th Century after earth has been ravaged by class warfare. The riff raff still suffer on Apocalyptic earth and live like criminals/animals. Effectively depicted was the ravaged look of a potentially human-destroyed earth(actually real life living conditions in today's District Federal in Mexico City...Ugggh). Matt Damon's character wants in the worst way to get up to Elysium to save his life. Of course, lots of obstacles to that come up. Duh.The film broke down IMO when Damon's character got to Elysium and the explosions, bangs, gun play and other adventure film idiocy took over for the mostly intelligent beginning and the story resolved into a standard sci-fi adventure flick with way too many suspensions of logic and disbelief required to get through it. For one major flaw, where was the premium Elysium defense system when Damon's ship arrived to invade it? You would think the filthy rich would have a super-duper foolproof setup to foil any mongrel humans from getting in and soiling that fine nest. But, no. Thus, they got in. Dumb, but that's what allowed the downtrodden a very improbable win. Yea! for the downtrodden! IMO, an average sci-fi adventure flick overall, no more.",6,1,4,26 August 2013
Woman in Gold," Mirren is headed the way of Maggie Smith
","This Mirren vehicle was a crowd pleasing time-passer not overly concerned with historical accuracy when compared to lavish 'production values' that always make the filmmaker and studio much more money, as they know viewers will always choose entertainment value over factual history(so booooring!). Everyone know what 'dumbed down' means? Also, Mirren is getting typecast in her recent 'queenly' roles just as Maggie Smith has been firmly typecast in her old lady, snipey zinger slinger-roles of late in Downton and Marigold Hotel. A profitable trend for both of them no doubt, but it only adds to their bank accounts, not to their list of great roles.Lovely and stately Vienna, one of the world's greatest cities, was at its stunning best here, along with its many dramatically regal rooms that were used for virtually every scene filmed there. The story is of of a Mrs. Altmann, now a clothes retailer resident of L.A., but late of a wealthy Viennese, Jewish family, many of whom where killed later in WWII concentration camps, and how she escaped Nazi rule as her family's treasured art did not. All were stolen by the Nazis and reside in a Vienna museum that will not let them be reclaimed by the original owners.Getting that art returned to her was her life's passion and she almost never gave up that pursuit, and did need tremendous support along the way from her attorney to achieve it. The Altmann family's famous, Woman in Gold painting was the center of this eponymous story's attention due to its great artistic merit and vast monetary value. (Why and how there should EVER be any question at all about the righteous retrieval of those stolen paintings back to their legal owners is well beyond my understanding and conscience).The often humorous but sometimes harsh interplay between Mrs. Altmann and her young attorney, who zealously worked his backside off to get for her the fair and legal return of her treasures against the absolute denial of that wish by the museum's Nazi-like officer, was the story's main 'grab'.The story was not always right on point but it always interesting, most always engaging, with the end result mostly justifying our time in watching it. Now, go read the actual history online to know the entire story, and even though it has more or less the same ending as the movie does, it is well worth anyone's time who is as interested in the factual events of important global history as in what movies do with it to entertain us. Monument's Men is another one even more interesting...the real story, not so much the movie.",6,0,2,11 April 2015
Invincible," And yet another 'Rocky'
","Old South-Phillie-town.... trashed and worn out, with hard times, broken love and broken dreams in spades, but it turns out to be a winner anyway, even though this story's been done so many times before. Hard to say that any new creative ground was broken with Invincible, but it was well done and con-Vinc(e)-ing enough to get a thumbs-up from me. We all love to see a deep underdog win, even if it's for the 100th time, and even in worn out Rocky-town. This was a football Rocky flick, yes, but the story moves our hearts just the same, as it is a profoundly human story that will always move us if well told, and this one was surely well told. Faith and hope are what keeps us all going, and this film was filled with both.What I liked best is that it showed that people still can and do pull together for a common cause if their beliefs are strong enough, even if it's sports and not the world of real life(To these guys, the Eagles were more important than real life). Beliefs here were shown to be stronger almost than breathing, really more like a choice between life and death. The poor, struggling but tough-as-nails guys shown in this 'hood had such a hard time being even close to successful in life, but their faith in the Eagles kept them going until it all finally paid off in a winner, and especially for Vince Papali, the bartender/substitute teacher profiled so well here. And, he got the girl! Yo, Adrian, where are you when we need you?",7,0,1,21 September 2006
Inside Man," Entertaining overall, but slow in the middle
","I mostly liked this Spike Lee film, but I wondered early on if Denzel's cop character was going to turn out to be the real 'Inside Man'. He did get a gift from the genius bank robber at the end. Why? It was probably a token from the genius crook, who by that act was paying a smart detective handsomely for the rare challenge to his brilliance, or maybe for not being smart enough to catch him? With Spike, it has to be the former. And, actually, in the end, the detective actually did the bank robber's dirty work for him that cost the Big Cheese dearly and maybe even bought him down, so the detective worked out to be the brilliant crook's Inside Man after all. Pretty formulaic, but sharp and engrossing. Denzel was his usual very impressive, cool cat self and Clive Owen as the genius crook was terrific.Jodie Foster played a powerful rich bitch very well, one who rubbed viewer noses in something smelly that we already know, that the filthy rich are very different than the rest of us(maybe it's the money and the power and all the rest( and can do what they want to the rest of us. She did provide an important connection to the real bad rich guy of the story who paid her well for her slick work, and her bitchchick role was a great choice for the fixer between Denzel's cop and the Very Big bad banker. I liked the way that part was pulled off and the creative and suspenseful conclusion. In the end I thought it was worth the slow pace and lightweight violence that dragged it down midway.Spike Lee's boring and out of date racist drone of the white guys always being the bad guys and the black guys always being the good guys is getting real old. Not very realistic today, just like a lot of this film. But, it was a good story of a smart and creative caper and that is enough to make me recommend it.",7,3,3,10 April 2006
The Departed," Great, but brutally exhausting to watch
","With his films, Scorcese usually tests our guts, stamina and tolerance for pain. With The Departed he even exceeds his previous unbroken records in all of these areas. This is the most powerful film I have seen in ages, but is hard to get to the end without feeling emotionally wrung out from watching his graphic depiction of human venal excess. The extreme violence, profanity, evil, treachery and power addiction wore me out by the end but also made me remember that various forms of these abominable human behaviors do exist in real life and are not exclusive to the criminal world but occur in regular society and the business world as well.The film story has been outlined by others, so it is my interest here to discuss the philosophy behind making it. Was it made just for profit, or did it have other agendas? It is MHO that with Scorsese, any possible harm to our children and adult sensibilities from watching his films always comes in last compared to the quality of the story told, no matter how tough the subject, from Mean Streets to Taxi Driver and Goodfellas to here. All were degraded and mean societal bottom feeder stories, but were dramatized versions of real life that some people live on some level every day. All of his films show the grittiest and harshest aspects of the tortuous underbelly of our modern 'civilization' that cause cruel things to happen in some people's lives and not just to the lowest underclass. Most of us don't know that and Scorsese knows we don't know that so he does his best to show it to us in a way that forever shocks and assaults us as much as Tarantino, Kubrick, or Peckinpah ever did, and maybe more so. And, to do so is very profitable for him as we eat it up, violent wild animals that we are. And, I am very sure that his degrading depictions of our progressively more violent 'culture' don't help us improve socially as it is becoming more and more commonplace to see violent degradation everywhere and not just in films(but especially IN films), and Scorsese is only too willing to dramatically show us the reprehensible behavior in our culture that some of us commit on each other for personal gain without thought for the consequences to all mankind in the end. Maybe Scorsese is doing his part to force some form of social change by rubbing our noses in human behavioral filth. As a counterpoint though, how many of us think the violence such as that shown in Scorsese's films is worse than or not as bad for our society as the severe and life-ruining emotional and financial damage to millions of people's retirement as done by Enron, WorldCom, etc.? Hmmmmm.Finally, I have to admit that I am drawn to his films like a moth to a flame and I can't say that I like that about me, but it is true that Scorsese's work holds an uncomfortable and almost addictive attraction for me and many others. Maybe it's like smoking, drinking or drugs done to excess...all of us know these are bad for us, but some of us just can't help using them even though we know all too well the brutal consequences. We just continue to say, 'Someday I'm going to stop.' Sure we will.",8,0,0,10 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Cruise miscast as a dumb guy
","Tom does not do dumb parts well, as nearly all of his previous film characters have been intense, driven and very smart guys. But Ray Ferrier in WOTW was just plain dumb, thus Tom was way out of his element and the wrong choice for the role as I wanted him to be so much smarter. Forget all the recent Scientology crap, Tom is still at the top of the list when smart, intense and driven is needed in a film lead, and that is why WOTW was so wrong for him, and for me as a result. Could he have chosen a dumber way to escape the aliens than going along with all the other dopes trying to escape in the very same way? I would say, 'get supplies and take to the woods where no other people are, as the aliens will concentrate on populated areas thus you will have better survival chances'. But, no, duhhhhh.I have never seen a film that was so badly disconnected in its two main elements....story and special effects. The FX were among the best, as with all Spielberg flicks, but the story was among the dumbest ever and maybe even worse than The Day After Tomorrow storyline, and appeared even worse when put together with the great FX. Someday, maybe someday, someone will make an all out apocalypse/alien invasion film with only war action and without all the junk like the sappy Spielberg family touches he puts in all of his 'family' films(but not in Saving Private Ryan which was a truly great film. See, it is possible!).... like parents and kids constantly hugging, crying, screaming, whining, clinging....all so dam aggravating that they tear down the quality the other film elements have built up to the point where it all comes together as just mediocre...the very worst thing a film like this one can be and just like this sappy one made by a real family guy with 9 kids for god's sake, as Spielberg has!When that great action film is made, without all the mushy family stuff to ruin it, I(at 50+) and all the techies and teenage boys in the world will see it 20 times or more for the great FX details alone, but I won't see this one even one more time due to the stupid and obnoxious story...dumb dad, bratty kids, moronic escape plan....and how all of these mostly ruined this great earth invasion story by H.G. Wells.I am waiting and hoping(I have even written Spielberg and Lucas) for the time when films are made to be interactive, so anyone can edit all the film shot into what makes a great film for each of us, and then share it over the internet to win contests or movie careers. Before that though, please Spielburg, make at least two versions of your films with at least one without all the sappy family/kid crap that you like so much but ruins it for me and is intended only to get the girls and the girlie men's butts in the seats so you can make more money.

There Will Be Blood," Great epic tale of a post-frontier oil tycoon
","(Earlier made the mistake in this review of calling this a Coen Bros film; was thinking of No Country For Old Men, another great one. Sorry for the mistake; correction made)You might have thought Day-Lewis' character Plainview was just 'plain' nuts in his desperate search for oil and he was, but most fantastically successful businessmen of olden days(some today too) were ruthless, heartless competitors who not only wanted to win, they wanted to bury the competition just as Plainview did. He was a certain type of harsh man perhaps more common in that day and time than now, but in contrast, he could also appear to be a regular family man and father and could be downright friendly in his own direct businesslike way of holding town meetings in which he gently but persuasively tried to convince landowners to sell or lease their land to him for oil exploration. And, he was mostly fair to them in what he paid for their oil rights. He was totally paranoid within his mental illness, but he was a very good businessman and fabulously successful in what he did. This very different and fascinating film was at times hard to watch as it kept us upset and anxious throughout, always trying to figure out the madman Plainview and what harsh thing he would do next. On the one hand, so loving and affectionate to his non-threatening,(stolen-not-adopted) sweet young son, but so ruthless and killer-hateful to that same son when grown and wrongly perceived as a competitor. So single-mindedly driven in his search for oil, so crazy-minded when anyone threatened, or even maybe threatened, what he wanted to do to get all the oil and win everything while utterly crushing the competition. He was a self admitted people hater, and showed that immense hate whenever any disagreement with what he wanted arose. What a study in contrasts he was, and Day-Lewis made him one of the most interesting film characters in ages with his spot-on, brilliant portrayal of this madly-obsessed fortune hunter.(A side note: when someone so outstanding in their field displays their immense talent and skill, it is a wonder and honor for us to watch, and Day-Lewis is that person in films today, as was Hopkins in his prime, and of course, Brando. Pacino, Sean Penn, and P.S. Hoffman might also be placed in that rare atmosphere today.)Blood was such a special and uniquely made film, with many starkly lonely, but very effective mining country shots and a deeply brooding classical score contributing much to the special overall strangeness. As the young Plainview explored for his first oil discovery, we saw only him digging in his mine, with no spoken words for the first 15 minutes or so, to mesmerizing effect...when was the last time you saw(did not hear)that in a film? And Day-Lewis...what more can be said about his talent that has not been said? This much can be added.....see him every time you can as there have been few in his talent realm in the entire history of film. He is of greatness.If I had my second thoughts as Anderson, the filmmaker, I might have ended this harsh story about 15 minutes before the actual end, or eased the ending a bit. But, that would have been a mistake, as the ending used did so accurately show the horror that a driven and deranged person is capable of doing to another when a slight done even many decades earlier is still felt hotly burning within and crying out for the worst possible revenge.See this film for a great epic story of early-day, American empire building, and to get to know the type of man who did much of it a hundred-plus years ago, and may still do it in today's world(Bill Gates?).Also, read J.P. Morgan's biography or that of Henry Ford if you think Plainview's character was pure fiction. It happened.",9,2,8,22 January 2008
Downfall," Effective drama, grave and shocking
","Yes, Hitler was an unlikely leader of nations but was not a king nor an emperor but was duly elected into office by a supportive populace. The driving force of his impossible vision was due to two main things not often told or even known....one, his deeply neurotic mother love which gradually transformed itself into his deeply neurotic mother love of his(replacement)mother country and two, the character warping accomplished by this utopian artist's unshakable idealistic vision of the perfect world where all perfect things are forever perfectly in their places, just as in a perfect painting on a canvas created by a 'perfect' artist such as he. An impossible combination, but always possible to him.The mongrelized and thus, to him, imperfect world around him could never be the glorious Aryan world he wanted it to be, but he could not see that truth until the broken end of his fantasy dream, and the film showed well the harrowing result of that break through his collapse into madness and physical debilitation when the real truth of defeat became no longer avoidable.In the future, all determined Utopia-builders will be forever feared, hated and defeated every time they arise, and this fact is in large part due to Hitler's undeniable but personally unknown contribution to the future of mankind and world history though his defeat. Unfortunately, this very same lesson has been obviously shown to us over and over throughout man's long history, but successive generations from each such event seem to have to relearn, through their own tragic experiences, this cruel lesson, the cost of which is always unspeakable human suffering that could have been essentially avoided if we humans could only better learn this oft-repeated historical lesson. One would think that, for man to endure, this lesson must stick tight to humanity one fine day.Perhaps this defect indicates in part the real potential of human cloning as a future way to hopefully avoid the gross historical mistakes from which we humans cannot now seem to learn in order to co-exist in peace. Cloning scares me greatly, but we have to be open to its unknown possibilities for improving human beings as a species.About the film....the main story of the film was the Russian invasion of Berlin, but it was so drawn-out and inconsistent, as they were near the bunker and then not, near again, and then not, and then again, until they finally were there and triumphed. Obviously it was done this way for greater dramatic effect as it made for a more exiting film, but even small changes in well documented war history annoy me when only done for entertainment's sake, thus more profit. True history demands greater honor than that.Hitler's secretary was an important part of the film and of the true bunker story....but Fraulein Jumps' marriage and name change to Frau Junge was not even mentioned.....a sensitive congrats from Hitler that actually occurred was overlooked in the film, possibly in order to not humanize Hitler too much. In reality, Hitler was very fond of his Bunker 'inmates' throughout the siege and thanked them often for their contribution to the cause, which proves that even monstrously sick people such as he can sometimes do nice and very human things on the long and uneven road to infamy.Overall, the film was very effective in showing the main downside to the personal impact of infamy, that for some of them the only way to escape the terror of inescapable immense public hatred and humiliation resulting from a fall from grace is through the coward's door of suicide, and many criminals along with Hitler have passed through that inglorious door to eternal silence without ever having to face the incredible damage of their actions.",7,1,9,21 March 2005
The Wolf of Wall Street," Entertainment, not reality
","Yes, Scorsese has always entertained us so well with abberant types, from mobsters to street criminals to boiler room stock brokers, all dealing death or financial destruction 24/7. But, do any of them bear even a faint resemblance to what really happened, and did those people actually behave that way? Regarding this film, I worked on Wall Street during that time, and even though we had heard of Jordan Belfort's firm, it was totally discounted as a boiler room and had no Street cred at all, just a terrible rep as sleazebag junk. It was no more than a side story to the real Wall Street, as those boiler room types were the lowest level of that era's greed-is-good WS slicksters.But, the movie.....could any human superman take the amount of drugs and unprotected sex shown in this story and even function, let alone at a high continuous level and not have a fatal heart attack? None that I have known or seen, and I have seen a lot. But, Dicaprio as Belfort was a marvelous choice for this outsized role, and he played it to the hilt as never before, with Jonah Hill as his sidekick comic relief, and Matthew Macconaughey a great choice for Belfort's oddball, probably whacked out(off?)mentor, and Bob DeNiro in a short mobster spot.It was such fast action that the 3 hours went by quickly, with not a dull moment in it. I enjoyed the fantasy ride that Disney could not have done better, but I could never get past the fact that it was 99% dramatized fiction, done to sell tickets(greed is good!) but not to enlighten us at all about the real Wall Street of that era.",Null,209,392,26 December 2013
American Gangster," Denzell owned this film
","I've read a lot about Frank Lucas, the Harlem drug lord of the 80's depicted in this story, and even though I liked this film for pure entertainment, it did vary so much from the truth about Lucas that it was closer to fiction. It did do the broad strokes about his life pretty well, but purposely added or subtracted many connecting details for greater audience entertainment value. Director Ridley Scott usually puts a lot more suspense, fear and terror into his films so I was surprised that there was so much less than his usual in this story of the kill or be killed jungle of street drug dealers in Harlem. There is almost no life on earth tougher and more life threatening every second of the day than that of a drug lord, and it was in reality much more threatening to his life and that of his family than was shown.Denzell Washington as Lucas, even though he is as coolly intense as an actor can be, did not let much 'street' break through his high and mighty, cool cat demeanor, even when the story might have been better with more of it for greater crime realism. However, his prominent role was by far the best one in the film and more convincing than Russell Crowe as Richie Roberts, an(the only?)honest cop soon to become a defense lawyer, who dogged Lucas to jail after he finally found out that Lucas was at the top of the drug dealer food chain, a perch that was heavily supported by the men in blue, most of whom were on the take. Crowe was satisfactory overall in his bad husband/good cop role, but it was Washington who really owned this film. He is such a powerful presence as an actor, and when he was watching or listening to someone you could almost feel the wind from the wheels turning in his head. That alone conveyed well the stone cold calculation necessary for survival at the top in his jungle.A very entertaining film all in all, and I was glad to see that the storyline didn't kill Lucas off in a a fit of typical Hollywood, crime-does-not-pay, phony comeuppance, but he was shown briefly as he walked out of prison in his $50 suit, looking sadly out of place and a nobody in the modern outside world after so many lost years in prison. What could be more pitiful and humiliating than that one thing for anyone who used to have real power? Does any crime ever pay if you have to spend even one night in the very cruel and unloving embrace of the graybar hotel? Not to me.",8,1,6,6 November 2007
Inception," Creative and inspired nonsense
","I gave this film a 7 due to its technical, acting and CGI innovation and brilliance, but cannot recommend it as anything other than attractive theoretical masturbation. It was great entertainment, but that is all that it was. No story could be much further from reality than this one was.As a scientist viewing it from a purely scientific position, the absurd theory and its execution in this story would be approximately akin to one postulating then expecting that 'pregnant cows sent into space would give birth to pigs and then return to earth as puppies water skiing behind porpoises'.The above postulation is almost as absurd as this film story was, but maybe not quite. Leo is now one of our great American film actors and did a great and convincing job in his role, as did the entire film for extracting great reviews from people who know absolutely nothing about real science, but sure do love loud and visually exciting and bombastic stories of extreme pseudo-science. However, my scientific training and experience would not allow me to join them in that fawning praise even though I did like Leo and the CGI work a lot. Human reality and truth are too crucial to me to ever become a fan of such utter nonsense, no matter how attractively presented it may be. Perhaps that may be my loss, but so be it.",7,4,10,19 July 2010
Lord of War," Cage as an actor is like Costner...too laid back
","in most films to involve me much in what he does. That being said, he does a pretty good job here as his all mind no emotion approach to his arms-running 'job' is right for the central character of this horrifying film subject. It's not often that money over lives is shown so graphically to be of such greater importance to the depraved people doing it that whatever happens to the world as a result means absolutely nothing to them....they would merely say, 'it's a business, like any other.' As with most Nick Cage films it doesn't survive close scrutiny for details and realism, but it is a good non-stop action film about one of the lowest forms of human activity, about one step above or below child porno/sexual slavery. And, neither have any regard for human life.As most others have detailed the film's plot and, alas, its outcome, most of what is left are the emotions evoked by the film's subject, that of private-business arms-running to wherever in the world there is a bloody 'war' and big money to be made off of it. The main question is.....It does make obscene money and is grossly immoral, but does anything it does or causes make an ant's toenail difference in the big world picture? Some would say no, others would say it makes every difference. These strong arguments can be made either way, as some might say, 'if I don't do it someone else will, so what?', and on the other side, 'it just brings us that much closer to the Appocalypse'.We alive now probably will never know the eventual true cosmic cost of this seemingly heinous activity or whether it has a cost the world truly cares about, but it may suffice to say that violent human behavior through history has been forbidden and/or supported in every human endeavor, including religion past and present. But, who can say with authority that it means much to the world in the long run, or if there will be a long run as a result? Some would say it makes no difference to the world as we are all worm food in the end, and the recycling of our bodily energy is all the world cares about whether it is too early or too late or now or whenever, just so it gets done and allows the earth to go on doing what it does best to survive.But, it is really aesthetically and spiritually worth living in a world that coldly pragmatic, with no other importance for us than to feed the eternal earth recycle? Most on this earth would say no. Thus enters religion, and the other side of the meaning of life issue for most of us. This eternal conflict was the main thing I thought of as the film credits rolled. For that reason, this terrifying film was worth seeing.Which side are you on?",7,0,5,29 September 2005
The Good Shepherd," Slow, but had the foreboding nature necessary for good spy film
","The comment by an identity-stolen soviet spy midway through this film that Russia was rust and could barely hold itself together and that the Cold War was a USA invention reminded me of what my tax man said about the IRS, 'everyone worries without cause about an audit; hell, the IRS can barely keep its doors open it is so incompetent.' Maybe Russia was incompetent and the Cold War was a USA invention to keep taxpayers paying big taxes to the gov't to support it, and to give them something to hate other than their own corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. At times during this film, I was leaning strongly toward those views, as the people shown, who were supposed to protect us, were so corrupt and wrong-headed about what is good for America that they were obviously of the same breed that is causing this country so much of its world trouble today. Remember, the Skull and Bones Society of politically ambitious, 'patriotic' Yale men displayed so often in the film is also the secret club where the two Bush failures-as-president got their 'patriotic' start. Hmmmm.Matt Damon as the main spy Edward Wilson was a curious casting choice for the humorless lead spy, with his ageless boyish face and big toothy grin. Not whom I would have chosen for the part, but he did a serviceable job in a glum role. I once knew a retired FBI lifer and he was life-of-the-party cheerful, so the mostly somber, life-or-death tone of the CIA lifers in this film may not have been accurately depicted. William Hurt, Bob DeNiro, and Michael Gambon were terrific as high level CIA operatives/executives, as was Wilson's deaf girlfriend, a gorgeous Judy Garland lookalike. Angie Jolie was even pretty good as Wilson's bored and detached wife but was pretty much wasted in her role.Overall, I thought the film accomplished its end of showing how seriously close we came to war during the Bay of Pigs episode, which would have been enough material for any sensible film. But, no, it was an overlong epic running the course of about 40 years, with too many unnecessary side stories thrown in along the way that damaged the pacing and flow of a good spy tale, but that is the way of Hollywood film-making these days, as one good story doesn't seem to be enough for them when ten lesser ones are possible. That way, there is 'something for everyone', but that can ruin even a great film by trying to get all of the available paying butts in the theater seats instead of just those wanting a great spy film with no unrealistic distractions thrown in.",7,2,3,28 December 2006
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," You will not forget this film
","A priceless film by director Alejandro González Iñárritu, a genius totally at odds with Hollywood values, and one not fearing to ask of his actors total truth and exposure and even madness to get at the bare and painful truth of the story. Michael Keaton plays Riggin, an aging actor famous for his Birdman character in a Batman-like, comic book movie from twenty years earlier. Washed up and broke, he now risks whatever is left producing and acting in an old play about love by a famous playwright he once met in a bar. The play is now rehearsing on Broadway, and Riggin is torn and thrashed at every turn by the play's production problems, his star actor's arrogance, his own past, his angry daughter, a vicious media critic, and most especially the insane voice in his head and his life-threatening fear of failure.Director Inarritu, he of 21 Grams and Biutiful fame, fashions a film story unlike any director working today, more like a play than a film, with no 'movie star turns' by any actor, with no one character overpowering the others, all working for and off each other for the best end result....the most truth in themselves and in the story. Keaton was an inspired selection for the lead considering that he once played Batman 20 years ago, and that he obviously had personal experience with a lot of the same emotions that Riggin felt....trying to come back, trying to overcome old and worn out fame, trying to prove that he was more than a has-been movie star. Riggin was also giving his life trying to prove to himself and the world that he could make it as a real producer/actor in the toughest venue possible....Broadway. He must prove it to himself... even after he harmed his chances by scolding a hateful critic that was determined to make his play a flop. Plus, as if more pain were needed, Riggin was a 'recovering' alcoholic and an guilt-ridden absentee father to his resentful daughter who was helping out as a gofer. All of that impossible to overcome? Yes, perhaps, except for grace that the Unintended Virtue of Ignorance might provide.Edward Norton and Naomi Watts were strong support, along with a great turn by Zach Galifianakis as Riggin's agent/manager/best friend, and Emma Stone as his daughter. Inarriti always gets such honest but tortured performances from his actors, and the result of that effort is a film that surely will be a future classic and is without a doubt the best film of the year to date. Keaton is a lock for a Best Actor nomination as is Inarritu for Best Director. The searing and painful truth of this story and its superb acting is what great and classic films are made of. You will never forget it.",10,8,20,1 November 2014
Paths of Glory," Along with King & Country, the best anti-war movie ever made
","Kirk Douglas is far and away the best actor never to win an Academy Award for Best Actor. Consider his work in this film, Lust For Life and The List of Adrian Messenger as 3 great examples. And, there were other performances nearly as great, as his work in Detective Story.The straitjacketed thinking and actions of the military mind(and the gov't) was never shown better than in Paths of Glory except perhaps for All Quiet On The Western Front. There is no question that this thinking is why we go to war instead of using all other alternatives to the very last degree in order to avoid it. Also, if the old men who declare wars and send young men into battle to die also had to fight those wars on the front lines, there wouldn't be another war, ever.In POG, the hideous part where the sick and dying soldier was shown being executed instead of being allowed to die a soon-forthcoming natural death was the best example of the cast-in-concrete military mind I have ever seen. And, so true, as I was in the Army and saw things such as this firsthand.If you like this film, also see The Young Lions for a similar message and a great Marlon Brando performance.",9,0,0,9 December 2005
Casino Royale," Top notch entertainment but don't expect any realism
","For proof, the initial chase scene between the 'new' Bond(Daniel Craig, a Shakespearian-trained Brit) and the bad guy could only have been accomplished by androids or the like, as no human in the world is in such great condition to be able to do even 10% of what they did. And, neither was hurt or breathing hard when Bond finally got his man after about 15 minutes of full-out running and falling and crashing into hard things, like steel cranes. Way cool, but also way unrealistic as is typical with all previous Bond films. Nothing different there, and all FX were marvelously done and very dramatic, as always.I really enjoyed the new Bond..ice blue eyes, and rough, tough, buff and more sensitive but also more blue-collar than all previous Bonds. He had none of the snooty, upper-class Brit mannerisms we saw in the previous 007's. Richard Gere said in An Officer and a Gentleman, 'I have no place else to go', and this new Bond could have said it too, as he 'is' 007 through and through and could be nothing else. His new 'humanity' instead of previous Bond imperviousness or insensitivity was refreshing, but it did somewhat shock me to see a real human being with loving feelings wiping out scores of people without a second thought even if they were the baddies. Again, not realistic at all, but tres entertaining. Don't try this at home.I enjoyed this movie more than all other Bonds except Goldfinger..the storytelling was more or less the same as others and predictable, but Bond was very different this time....and much better. I hope he does many more.",9,1,2,11 December 2006
Amélie," When the magic works, it is truly magic
","Audrey Tautou is the cutest French actress since the other Audrey(OK, Hepburn was Belgian but spoke French) in Roman Holiday, and stole my heart with every funny look. For me, this French comedy had the most clever, quirky, and interesting human character story since La Cage Aux Folle. It twisted and turned constantly, showing us Amelie's lonely and odd life and the goofy lives of the other characters while charming us at every turn, but it always guided us back to Amelie's diligent and very creative attempts to get the man of her dreams, detailing the ingenious ways she used to finally reel him in to great happiness for both.The scene direction was incomparable, the story line was wonderfully drawn, and Audrey Tautou has the most sparkling comedic looks and timing since Goldie Hawn. But, one thing stood above even these great attributes.....the cinematography was about the best I have seen in any film. The OZ-like colors, of course done digitally as they were cartoon-like exaggerations, were true art and made the film so much more magical and fantastic than it would have been just using the realistic colors of Paris. Camera angles and movement, shot selection, and lighting also were so creative, and I marveled at them just as I would looking at an old masters painting. It was that good.French films are generally so humanly clever, and I never tire of watching them for their constant creative genius in showing us quirky 'French' ways of obliquely seeing people's personal lives and their human foibles perhaps as through a little side window instead of through the big front door, as is usually done by Hollywood. This one was the absolute best I have seen in doing that. Don't miss this charmer.",9,0,3,19 July 2005
Moonrise Kingdom," If you like Tim Burton you will like Wes Anderson
","A fun movie. Maybe not quite a classic like Beetlejuice but will entertain for years as the story is timeless and done with a totally straight face by every character, even though it was so totally odd, quirky and funny that it never could be possible in real life. I kept looking for Johnny Depp, knowing he he had to be in it, but he wasn't.The filmmaker Wes Anderson made each scene a viewer's paradise, as the main scene was always just part of the whole action. Two, three or even four odd and strange sub-scenes were always in the background, so each time you see it you will see something great you may have missed before.The story is of a foster home runaway twelve year old Khaki Scout boy who meets a lonely girl on a rural East Coast island, and love blooms. The entire story is how they constantly evaded being found after running away to hide together in all the island's secret spots, but then were found.Bill Murray and Frances McDormand were the girl's very odd parents, with Edward Norton in an against-type role as the dead serious, officious and so-procedurally-correct Khaki Scout Master. His scout camp scenes with his scouts were priceless. Anderson is a master of scene decoration and cast costuming as well as dialog, and constantly hits exactly what is needed perfectly for best audience effect. The zany dialog was always spoken so earnestly, even though it was mostly outrageous, which made it best for surprise and resulting big laughs no matter how unlikely the story or dialog so it never seemed contrived or phony. It was so well done that it will be one of the summer's best comedies, for sure. If you liked the total quirkiness of Ed Wood, Ghost Story or Big Fish, you will like this one. Don't miss it.",8,2,4,18 June 2012
Munich," Best Spielberg film in a while
","Spielberg's last film had a deficient story patched together with great modern FX and was a failure, even with Tom Cruise in it. Munich was a great story with almost no modern FX. Which film was better? Munich, hands down. Thus, FX alone does not a great Spielberg movie make, contrary to the opinions of many children of all ages who wouldn't know a great story if it came out of a dark closet wearing King Kong's ape suit. 'Show me the action', they would say. Well, Munich had plenty of action, and plenty of great story too. That's enough for anyone who loves great and authentic(as is possible in a dramatic film) history films as much as I do.Ahhh, Munich, that Spielberg labor of love so well done overall.....dramatic..... balanced.... well acted.... so aware of historical truths on both sides. Other than needing about 20 or so slow minutes cut out to enhance the pacing and suspense element it was terrific, and scary as hell in places. Spielberg knows better than most how to show the common man in uncommon crisis situations, with that man's warts and incompetences and humanity(or lack of it) bared, and he did it just right here, almost to nerve-wracking, nail-biting excess.Others have detailed the story to a fare-thee-well, so I won't. Suffice to say, Spielberg 'gets it' about the Middle East and its conflict history, and shows it in this film. His film told that a thousand years of Islamic-Jewish warfare is not going to be cured by trading lives now, just as it hasn't helped over those many past years. As one Islamic character in the film said.... as long as the Jews have a chunk of Palestine's homeland, the conflict will continue forever until they are gone, every single one. The keyword here is 'homeland', even the film recognized that, and the Palestinians will stop at nothing until they get it back so they can die at home in peace and glory.Carve another piece of land from some other country and give it to them instead?....Forget it. Palestinians will never stop until they get their original homeland back. It's ingrained in their religion and culture and they will never stop fighting for it. So, on it goes, endlessly.Will they get it back under Dub's watch?....No! Will it ever happen?... Arabic people are many and Jews are few and the world has many days left. Jews have had the world's sympathy since WWII so they have prevailed in this war to date, but with time and possibly more sympathetic world leaders to this Palestinian plight, who knows? That's as good an answer as any, and it could happen someday. It's a fickle world and alliances change.Someday, sometime, endless religion-based killing in the Middle East has to stop. See this film and understand better both sides of this issue. That's Spielberg's point, and I commend him highly for telling it so well.",8,6,12,3 January 2006
The Social Network," Ah, the ironies
","Terrific hatchet-job story of Mark Zuckerberg, genius, oddball, killer-competitive greedfreak, and perhaps Asperger-afflicted founder of Facebook. Whether I agree about the value of Facebook is not relevant to the worth of this film, as it is one of the best high tech film stories of the new millennium and revolves around what is now just so critical to many millions of people around the world.....internet social networking(OMG!).Even though his mother may have overdone it with endless 'be sure to close your mouth' admonitions in his youth(you'll see), Jesse Eisenberg was fantastic as the mind-in-his-head, maybe-inventor of internet social networking(but probably not, as shown)Zuckerberg, as was Andrew Garfield playing Eduardo Saverin, his his best friend and co-founder, maybe not as brainy but way more emotionally healthy. The rest of the cast was equally good, even Justin Timberlake was terrific, but with his outsized ego in full speed mode I am not sure he was 'acting' as Sean Parker, the cocky inventor of Napster and world-class devious manipulator. This story sadly but powerfully showed so well that youthful vigor, uber-creative ideas, killer-competitive juices, and premier business connections and execution will always be the best allies to selling out all previously held moral/ethical principles for the sake of humongous bucks and great fame.But, that said, the massive in-your-face ironies of the story were what was most interesting by far. Zuckerberg, as shown, was not social at all but wanted desperately to create a 'social network'. He also initially didn't care a bit about being rich, but he is now America's youngest billionaire ever. He also didn't think advertising was 'cool' on Facebook and was initially repulsed by it, but now his resistance ethics are well past totally sold-out and Facebook makes billions every year in advertising and rivals Google as the net's biggest ad bank. How many more personal ironies could the filmmaker have shown about Zuckerberg? And, can they all be that true?Thus, the story candidly displayed how easily and quickly one's honorable intentions can get left far behind when big money and fame arrives on the doorstep in truckloads. It also showed that even lifelong best friends and business partners are not safe when big success comes calling in its mask of many faces.See this perhaps best film of the year and learn some great net business startup savvy and pitfalls, but try not to get sucked into the money-making end of it. At least try for a minute or two to make your mom happy.",8,1,2,4 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," Style over substance, but what style!
","Probably the most lavish film production since Gone with the Wind. Wow, I could not stop thinking about how much this film had to cost, it was that outrageously extravagant(Liberace would have loved it!)Style trumped substance so greatly that the story was secondary to the production, and it resulted in a story that appeared to be more fairy tale than real life, which was just the way Gatsby wanted it to be in his attempt to be publicly accepted as a great party host and man of distinction, especially as he made his great wealth through hidden criminal enterprises that he painfully tried to keep very secret.DeCaprio was more or less effective as Gatsby, as his strangely nervous and angry moods and behavior reflected more a mental case than they did a fabulously successful businessman. I thought he should have been, as he was in the book, much more of a mystery man and less personally exposed in his great flaws for the story to be as engaging as the F. Scott Fitzgerald book. I did enjoy Toby Maguire's character Nick's story narration done later from a mental hospital, as he appeared at the time of the story to be the one normal person in a roomful of damaged people who could say what really happened. Carey Mulligan as Daisy was cute but didn't add enough presence for the role.Films change original stories a little or a lot to match what the writer and director want as entertainment, which is always more important in and to Hollywood than is adherence to source material, so this film result was not fully faithful to Fitzgerald's book as it was more a Broadway musical/drama hybrid extravaganza that was as over the top as it was an unrewarding story about the Great Man. If you love lavish productions and costuming, see it for that and forget about the flawed story relating to the book. It was as grand a show as they get but not much more than that.",6,1,1,13 May 2013
Cinderella Man," Typical Ron Howard commercial crowd pleaser
","Ron Howard makes the most commercial, feel good, crowd pleasing movies of today. That does not mean that they are the most thoughtful, insightful, expert, soulful, or innovative, but just that they are well crafted, basic and timeless morality tales that will be just as watchable 20 or 30 years down the road, as our hard wired human nature doesn't change enough in order to make his films outdated in that short time. His films are like 'The Wizard of Oz' in their simple old fashioned morality that we quietly love but won't admit to anyone, and just as timeless. That is Cinderella Man in a nutshell.However, I can only stomach about one of his sugary films every few years, and am thankful that it takes him about that long to get another one out. Cinderella Man showed Braddock as a saint worthy of being selected the next pope, not a real man with faults, and even if it was a good tale it still hit that spot in me that yells, 'no way!' History shows Braddock to have been a decent man and very tough fighter, but he had many well documented human failings that were not shown at all in the film. And the many shots of long wet kisses and fond caresses with his always responsive wife.....hot married romance with 3 starving kids and no food or heat or money?.......again, 'are you kidding?'! But the gals just eat this kind of phony stuff up and add greatly to ticket sales.My main concern was the same as with all phonied-up Hollywood films of today...the human body just realistically can't take anything near the brutal punishment these films show it can.... innumerable full force head punches, bomb explosions, hundreds of bullets, head on car wrecks or plunges off cliffs....and the lead character walks away just fine every time, just like Braddock did in this one after taking enough hard head punches to kill a hundred men. All baloney, but kids unfortunately believe a lot of it and sometimes kill themselves acting it out.This film was a human cartoon, no different than animated cartoons from Disney or Pixar.....with all of them having about the same believability, but it's the way Howard likes to see life through his films. The truth is, he never left Mayberry and Mayberry likes simple morality stories that end happily ever after, every single time.",6,1,3,13 June 2005
The Martian," Disappointing after reading the book
","So much was left out from the book, as of course it had to be with the limited time frame of a film. But so much of the science that was so interesting to me was omitted, and a lot of unnecessary stuff that bored me was inserted to get butts in the seats. Not much to do for Matt Damon as Mark Watney, the stranded astronaut on Mars, so Hollywood did what it does so well, it added emotional scenes not in the book to get the heartstrings going, but not so much the brain. Some of it was too silly for credibility, from a science perspective.Great visuals and NASA-type sets though, and I enjoyed those, even as the story was very lacking for those who read the book before.",6,2,9,10 October 2015
The Fighter," Christian Bale owns this film
","Bale gave one of the great performances in modern film in his role as Dicky Ecklund, former contender for a world boxing title, and brother of 'Irish' Micky Ward, the subject of this film's story. Bale was so great and Oscar-worthy in his role it is hard to believe he was not a boxer at some time in his life, as he had all the tics, moves and brain-damaged mannerisms down solid. Mark Wahlburg was quiet and competent as Ward, as he typically plays all of his roles, but the real acting kudos go to Bale, Melissa Leo as the mother of Ward and Ecklund and their seven blowsy sisters(!), and to Amy Adams as Ward's gorgeous but tough-as-nails, bartender girlfriend who supported and protected him against the specious love of his mother and brother who took every parasitic advantage of Ward to pursue their own wants at his expense. Coarse and ignorant ethnic mannerisms, speech patterns, and social behavior of that clannish Irish ghetto were so spot-on one could imagine all of the cast living their entire lives before this film in that poor, decrepit and decaying factory-town part of Lowell, Mass. They were that good.The story of the rise, fall, and rise again of Ward's boxing career was a good and involving one, made so much better due to the intertwined story of Ecklund's former boxing glory shown in stark contrast to his later life of a crack addicted, criminal loser whose job was to train his brother to be a world boxing champ but most often got derailed by his bad habit and truly pathetic friends. The harsh but loving family interplay of this big and rowdy group was the best thing in the story, as all the behavioral things that keep poor people down were shown so well here.......irresponsibility, ignorance, temper, addictions, clannishness, and a skewed view of reality and right and wrong and how to deal with all of it. A real lesson was shown in how to screw up your life, but also shown for balance was how to improve it through hard work and the love and concern of those who truly care. This outrageous family really cared for each other, hard as it was sometimes to believe, and it proved out in the end.One of the best films of the year and a true labor of love for Wahlberg, who tried for many years to get it made and finally did so in triumphant fashion. A real winner for him and for us.",8,2,2,23 December 2010
Up in the Air," shows the increasing personal detachment of our modern society
","Very slick film satire that tells a lot more about increasing personal detachment and heartlessness in the modern workplace than how companies do anything possible to avoid any unpleasantness associated with firing workers, although it did show the latter to nearly the most disgusting level possible. I did not like the movie's subject at all, but that huge negative alone should alert any critic to be very careful to make sure the story negative does not taint an honest review of the total film. This is a crummy topic told and shown well in this film and should be seen as much for its satire of craven human heartlessness and shallowness as much as for its entertainment value. My hope is that the former will teach you more than the latter.George Clooney, that smiling charmer, did a wonderful job as Ryan the star terminator, contract-firing everyone in sight while showing that selfish, facile, shallow and a big smile do the best work in a dirty and dully repetitive job(involving lots of full airports)that most people would avoid like the plague, and one that would quickly emotionally execute anyone with real human feelings. Anyone like Ryan who would say that firing is a prerequisite for possible world fame and power later is surely unclear on the emotional concept at least, but for Ryan it made it almost a plus to get fired as now the really big things in a person's life could begin! The old switcheroo gets them every time! Huh, what? But, when Ryan finds that his company plans to initiate video-termination(hey, a new video game?)instead of flying contracted people around to do that dirty job in person, he gets angry(maybe for the first time in his life? Remember, he's shallow)and expresses his disapproval but also his willingness to show them it won't work which he does with a vengeance. Along the way he gets to give a smarty-pants and uppity company newbie her comeuppance, find a hot but morally vacant female counterpart to play with for a while, and in the end get to continue what he does for a living as if nothing ever happened. From what I've seen of life, nothing really does happen in life to change shallow and emotionally bankrupt people like Ryan. And, we have all known some, and more's the pity for that unpleasantness.",8,0,5,15 December 2009
Atonement," Very slow chick flick became a bit more watchable as it went on
","After the first 30 minutes of total despair watching this slow, muddled and garbled chick flick, I was ready to leave and wondered why it was reviewed so well. What did I miss? But, I stayed due to my wife's effective insistence, but even at the end it still was just a watchable film overall, certainly not great and surely mainly interesting to female viewers wanting/needing a love story. The skin-over-bones, skeletally-thin lead actress, Kiera Knightly, was a aggravating melodramatic mess(channeling a young Katherine Hepburn?)with all her exaggerated gestures, and with her very unattractive figure and underbite she was totally unappealing to me as a romantic lead. But, hey, the critics sure liked this movie, both 'male' and female, as they watched and whooped it up while drinking their pink ladies and bloody mary's in their hot pink feather boas and tights, I'll bet.Of course, Brit females and girly men everywhere surely loved it, but I'll bet that most men of any nationality surely did not, and if any non-Brit male or female understood even half of what was said I'll give them money. That it had garbled dialogue would be a big complement for the lousy sound. This is good film-making? Not to me. And, with its irritating soft and out-of-focus cinematography, the only visual things I liked were the '30's period sets and costuming, and the lush English countryside. That's it.I'm as bored writing about this film as I was watching it. It is not worth any more of my words. Instead, see Before the Devil Knows You're Dead and No Country For Old Men for two films actually worth seeing.",5,2,7,23 December 2007
