First Man," First Man
","The first opening film of Venice. Like Armstrong's own feat, the film's word-of-mouth may fall into polarization, and the strong national spirit permeated is worth pondering, but it is still one of the most important biopic films this year. Chazelei slightly lost the aura of the first two parts, and the patience of hard shooting led commander Gao to show enough restraint, but some of the bridge sections can still feel the burst and romance in our memory. The director deliberately blurs Armstrong's boundary of whether he is a lunatic or a mission to the moon, and restores it from all levels of his husband's father, colleagues and friends. The best effect is to be an ordinary man as a husband and father.",7,0,0,7 April 2020
Black Swan," The missing point is scared away
","With a large section of ballet, the director's ability is very good, the whole movie is just right, but the beauty is everywhere, and the depiction of psychology is meticulous. Natalie sacrificed a lot for the film, and the performance was remarkable. From an artistic point of view, this film is comparable to red shoes. The exquisite cutting and the integration of human nature discussion have promoted the film to a new height.",9,0,1,16 April 2020
12 Angry Men," 12 Angry Men
","The plot unfolds well, but the part Davis advocates is only vague speculation. In fact, after proving these things one by one, the child may or may not be the murderer. It's just that the initial work of the prosecution has not been done well, the cross examination of the defense has not been done well, and the case should be investigated again, rather than simply acquitted. It's a great honor to see someone take a screenshot and quote this short comment 11 years ago as a vulgar mass representative. Now I would like to add that it is one thing to say that the dereliction of duty by the organs of power. There is no fault in reasonable questioning, but there is a fault in the verdict of acquittal. Because no matter whether the masses are blind followers or male masters, they are just crushed. Literary and art youth criticized me for pursuing the truth and vulgarity. So long as it is contrary to the institutional view, is it fair and just to accept the innocent result.",9,1,1,2 May 2020
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine
","Thanks to little misssunshine, I met me when I was tired and bored with nine to five and three to one. Little Miss Sunshine didn't tell me anything, didn't let me sink into the roof, and didn't use profound philosophy to get through my two veins of Ren and Du, and let my inspiration for life gush like a spring. Even it is in the process of uncertain future. I thank it because it makes me see so many people who have not been labeled as successful, who are living so hard and beautiful, just like all living beings, just like the world?",7,0,0,20 April 2020
Hugo," Hugo
","The old film is like a broken robot. It needs to be reopened by the repairer with the key of love. The rotation of the spring is the rotation of the film projector. The graffiti of the pen is just like the magic of the movie - to let future generations appreciate its charm and discover its history. Mr. Ma has fully demonstrated his feelings of enchantment, and the smooth 3D sports long lens has fully built up the sense of space, which is much better than those 3D throwing things to the audience at the screen at present!",8,0,0,14 April 2020
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now
","I agree with Roger Ebert on this film: modern civilization is just a crumbling building, perched on nature 's hungry mouth, and will be swallowed without hesitation. A happy life in front of this frailty is only a day-to-day reprieve. It is not so much about war as how it reveals the truth that we will never find.",9,0,0,7 May 2020
Dallas Buyers Club," Dallas Buyers Club
","According to the adaptation of real people, it vividly represents the living conditions and rights movement of AIDS patients in the 1980s. From patients to drug traffickers, they are very motivated. What's more, they don't give up their lives at home and eliminate their internal prejudices. The smuggled drugs that have more advantages than disadvantages to the outside compete with the drug administration that has more disadvantages than disadvantages, which is warm and powerful. Two actors are really using their lives in acting, using acting skills to fill the whole movie!",8,0,1,12 April 2020
Spirited Away," One of childhood's favorite movies
","After the re-release, I went to the cinema to see it once, as good as I remember, But unfortunately I didn't see the ending of two people together .",10,0,0,13 April 2020
No Country for Old Men," No Country for Old Men
","It's amazing that Oscar has awarded the best film to such a dark work. Harvey Baden's slayer of the spring gun is as cold-blooded as death. The narration is calm and abstemious, but most of the time it is frightening. The desolate Texas wasteland reflects the powerlessness and fragility of the individual in front of the mysterious evil. When the mood is stretched to the limit, the Cohen brothers directly omit the climax, leaving only the dry and staring audience to taste the despair and nothingness in silence.",8,2,3,19 April 2020
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan
","The real significance of the blockbuster, the beginning of the beach grabbing and the end of the rammel blood battle machine control into the magic skill, Niubi's primary and secondary close-up like a surviving World War II alliance veteran spitting in memory of the war. In front of him is the end of this slightly absurd task, and in front of him is the tomorrow of James Ryan.",9,0,1,5 May 2020
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of Everything
","The actors were very successful. Eddie and felicity both gave the best performance of their careers. The stubborn eyes of the latter were especially infectious. Focusing on the love and personal life of great scientists, soft light, cold / warm light, virtual focus, high-speed and Super 8 lens are widely used to create romantic temperament. It's smart to do the right thing. Hawking is an unfortunate but lucky man. Bless those strong and selfless women.",8,0,0,11 April 2020
Room," Room
","Between relative freedom and absolute freedom, movies let me see what kind of state people live in modern society. Although the change of space makes the painting style on the surface of the film suddenly change, in fact, people's response to the surroundings in different spaces has not changed, sometimes it's suppressed to make people tremble, sometimes it's melted by warmth. Love makes people safe. In order to get safety, we begin to possess, possess and destroy love.",8,0,0,10 April 2020
The Incredibles," The Incredibles
","This movie has taken the anti type films of superheroes to the extreme. There is not much talk about the middle-aged crisis and feminism. Talking about 'the villain is caused by superheroes' and 'the anti superhero act' is enough to make several films in Marvel movie universe. Besides, the problems raised by the movie were 14 years ago! Brad bird's films over the years are almost all excellent (except 'tomorrow's world'). It's so successful as a director!",8,0,0,1 May 2020
Call Me by Your Name," Call Me by Your Name
","Art, photography and just right soundtrack are all excellent. The beautiful summer time is just the story of first love. This director has always been very characteristic and outstanding in the image. The last scene is really fierce, a little bit of sentimentality. Although I thought it was OK and pretty good when I watched it, I always remembered the ending scene. It seems that I still remember it",8,1,2,9 April 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Hotaru no haka
","In fact, brother is the most difficult, mother died miserably, not only can't grieve in front of her young sister, but also must live a strong life, take care of her sister, take care of herself. In the era of war and turmoil, everyone can't expect anything from relatives and friends for food, only relying on themselves. The lively and innocent little sister is in sharp contrast to this background era!",10,0,0,6 May 2020
Up," Always keep the dream for life
","At the beginning of the film, the review of the life of the old couple is undoubtedly the biggest tear. They have lived a very good and happy life. When they are old, they still love each other deeply. Even if you are no longer there, they should take a risk in the end of their life with their shared dream. Just like children are not afraid of all curiosity, life is not hindered by dreams, no matter how old they are",9,1,1,17 April 2020
Joker," Joker
","The craziness of society brings about the collective craziness of anti society. It only takes a bad day for everyone to become a clown. To be honest, the proposition of 'doing evil because of oppression' is not new, but jackun Phoenix's step-by-step Methodist performance sublimates the whole movie! His body and expression perfectly tell the world what is the absolute darkness of the airtight~",9,3,5,6 April 2020
The Matrix," The Matrix
","Is it possible that the whole world is simulated by computers, and that we and everything around us are just a bunch of codes in computers? 'You are born to be a slave, just like everyone else, and you are born in a prison that you can't feel.' this assumption is enough to shake people's hearts, but the depth of 'The matrix' is more than that. It also raises new questions on this basis: will you choose blue pill or red pill? Is it to choose a beautiful fantasy or a cruel reality? On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but in fact, it is much more difficult than we think. On the one hand is the doomsday world in the future, devastated by hunger and cold, and faced with the danger of being chased by robots; on the other hand is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery on a bright day, and even the chance to become a successful person. Indeed, everyone knows that the best dreams are just dreams. But seifer is willing to sell everyone for a dream. If we really escape from the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as sever. Just as when you have a dream, you would rather stay in it than wake up.",8,0,0,3 May 2020
Slumdog Millionaire," Slumdog Millionaire
","Moving music, smooth rhythm, beautiful pictures - even dirty but also beautiful, are full of that kind of tenacious, unstoppable vitality all the time. But I still think In any case, it has the meaning of European and American directors looking at the East. This kind of 'curiosity hunting' is the same for us - Mumbai, which is prosperous and filthy, Taj Mahal in the sun and dust, dark streets and lanes, slums on garbage There are too many elements and symbols. Of course, they have ambition and enough means, but at the same time, they will also disperse a lot of things. Probably still alert. Anyway, Danny Bauer has two brushes There are not many storytelling directors these days.",9,0,0,18 April 2020
