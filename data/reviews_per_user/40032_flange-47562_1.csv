Blade Runner 2049," A lot of good stuff in this movie
","Good visuals, CGI and photography. Nice presence and mood. And most of all, a goodly number of plot twists, not like most scifi type movies. A bit long but it carried it well enough. Yes there are holes in the plot/action but it had to follow the universe created in the first film. Enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.",8,1,4,3 January 2018
