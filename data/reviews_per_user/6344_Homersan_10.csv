The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Boring Games: Mockingjawn - Part 0,5
","Sooooo, this was boring.... Sorry to be blunt and all, but that's just the sad truth I'm afraid. As other reviewers already mentioned... nothing really happens in this Part 1. Everything just feels like it's building up to something and then there were credits. Kinda like the first Hobbit movie.I liked the first 2 movies of Hunger games. It even convinced me to start reading the books. Books are great... but then again, these books can't be stretched anymore to make more money. Aaaaand the movies can. Let's lure more people to the movies, yeah!So, if you feel like watching a trailer of about 2 hours... be my guest. I'd advice to see the real trailer, it pretty much sums everything up. Oh yeah acting not bad but mostly forced dialogue. Almost George Lucas'ish... 3 action scenes that'll wake you up in time before the movies over.Can't wait for part 1,5!!!!!!!!!!!!",3,30,45,22 November 2014
Sucker Punch," Has it really come to this.... Teens, Sex and Crappy CGI
","'AAAaaaahhh, that sucked!' was the first thing I said when - finally - the credits rolled over the screen.I mean... what the hell did I just watch?? Is it a music video for the new rock-bad chick band called sucker punch or ??You could say they tried to make kinda a movie. When you see some of the reviews for this film, I'm thinking that this is the only they've ever seen, because we've seen it over.. and over... and over again. Not to mention a lot better!!You wanna see a good 'mental hospital' movie where someone also get's lobotomized and you'll actually give a damn?? Watch 'One flew over..' (Won't even finish the title, as it is an insult to me if you don't know this movie!!)As for the - I don't want to experience anything bad - scenes going into video game mode. Well, what can you say. Everyone's raving the CGI. I mean come on!!! Why don't you just go play the latest Quake, Half Life or any shooter and you get 10x better graphics than this.As in terms of movie CGI... to me, the best CGI's are the ones where you can't tell what's real and what's not. Watch the making of of Forrest Gump and be amazed how they used CGI to create some amazing shots!! Or Gladiator and how the created the stadium. That's CGI to be proud of !! Not a crap-fest like this....So in conclusion:Hot babes - check Crappy CGI - check Crappy story - check Tits hanging out all the time - check (thought this movie was supposed to be about condemning sexual violence or whatever)= a 'Sucker Punch' to the head and gut.But the guys from 10 - 18 will probably be having the time of their lives so.CU",5,7,18,19 June 2011
The Hunger Games," Good, because we've seen it already, otherwise it'd be great!
","OK, There was a potential 9 out of 10 here, but because I had a déjà vu feeling the entire movie I had to make it a 7. Which is still pretty good. First things first, Hunger games. I haven't read the books and tried to not let myself get 'captured' by the hype, as it mostly works negatively rather than positively imo. But the basic premise of the story, already dampened my anxiety. Drop people in a cage and the sole survivor wins. Battle royal anyone?? Don't know why no one made this comparison, because it's exactly the same...OK, I'll admit that this movie has more depth... but you can't deny that the killin' in battle was more awesome. Anywho, it's been done before basically. Also, the feeling of oppression, the underdog, the poor ghetto districts vs the rich and famous,... almost everything felt really familiar. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't good either. Another thing was the shaky camera in the beginning...Don't know the meaning of this, because normally you start a scene with a wide shot and then, you do the close-up etc. You don't shake your way through everything, hoping the audience feels like it's 'into' the movie more. The entire beginning up until the reaping was just one long headache to me. What I did like was the heartfelt acting involved. Have to give it up for the casting department here, because (almost) everyone was perfect. My only casting criticism was our president snow or what's he called? Mr. Donald Sutherland. Very fine actor, but what was he doing in here?? Looked like he was about the fall asleep. Which saddens me, because he got a good surrounding cast to work with. Give it up for Jennifer Lawrence who gives the performance of a lifetime. My favorite movie moment was a certain burial scene when the games are well on their way, and afterwards she gives their district's salute to the entire world, and by doing so, give the nudge to her people to fight for their own. Wow, I was just mesmerized by that. OK, the guys involved..Hutchersons, Ludwig and Hemsworth are also very fine actors and hold their own. I was even fine with Woody Harrelson, and that's saying something!!I hope that this movie get's the praise it deserves, as it is soooo much better than a certain other book/movie franchise that's going around, intended for the same age group....Here's hoping for 2 more movies and here's looking at Jennifer Lawrence!Raf",7,5,13,24 March 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," A must see for the entire family !!!!
","Ooooohhhh, what a movie, what an adventure, what a.... I can't... I'm lost for words !! How to describe the experience that is Tintin?? Even the opening credits will have you locked at the screen and it holds you there until the ending.So we have Tintin, a young reporter, that comes across a model of an old ship: The Unicorn. And so the adventure begins. There are a lot of action scenes that are really fast paced, but just when you think: It's getting too much, they slow down and you can rest for a while. If you've read the comic books, it helps of course as you remember a lot of things of your childhood. I advise everyone of you to read these comics and go see the movie, you won't regret. Best 10$ I've spend in ages.Major props to Andy Serkis, who plays Captain Haddock perfectly. Jamie Bell as Tintin is also very good, but I'd have to give it to Steven and Peter for creating this epic, and hopefully successful franchise.PS.: Try to avoid the 3D version... I didn't have any choice and although it was the best 3D experience yet, I still don't like the format. Stupid glasses and you get tired after 45 minutes...Best regards, Raf",8,0,3,7 November 2011
Saw III," Definitely the best of all 3 SAW movies !!!
","Hey Hey,Just saw saw III this evening (I'm not stuttering, it is correct :-) ) and absolutely loved it !! Man oh man is this a sick movie... In terms of all the horror scenes that is. In terms of thriller, storytelling, acting , etc. it's all very good! Not that the horror parts were bad or anything, I'm just saying.. On the contrary, I would put these scenes next to Hostel ( and that's saying something...)If you don't yell, get scared or flinch now and then in this movie... something gotta be wrong with you.. oh oh oh , how good was this film.One thing that the 'I hate SAW' people need to understand is that SAW is a genre on it's own now. The first was very good but you needed to look past some points were it could be better. Every movie has flaws... and for a fairly low budget it was very well pulled off!!For me, it's mostly the way the story takes one place ( most of the time, those places are horror, murder scene , related ) , but has a totally different meaning towards the end. And it produces these feeling in all the 3 films. But you never get the feeling that it's the same, you're just wondering throughout the film... Who is JIGSAW testing and how is he doing it ??conclusion :A MUST for thriller/horror/scary movie fans...but one warning, it's not for the weak hearted... you have been warned ;-)It surpasses the two previous saw movies in every way... even if you think halfway that you don't understand what he's doing, wait till the end !!! It is worth the confusion , that's the idea !!10/10P.S. A nice bonus touch for the fans of the previous SAW are the flashbacks to the previous saw films... very nice touch to bring them back.",7,3,5,18 December 2006
Unknown," Did you happen to see the latest Mercedes commercial, it's called Unknown ??
","Hmmm, I have some serious issues with this movie. Saw the trailer and liked it, but said at the same time that it's one of those - we-have-seen-it-all-before type story lines that depend more on how they tell and play it out. Then there was the ending of the trailer that ruined the entire movie.... He says: 'I haven't forgot everything' and then goes into a typical end-fight. Any of you guys remember this? When I was watching the movie yesterday, that line kept coming up and about 20 minutes in, I just about told the entire plot to my wife, like: I have a theory... this guy's actually their best assassin and this life was his cover, but now he only remembers this. Man oh man, talk about lame. Too much Bourne identity if you ask me.Then, about my subject... any1 wanna guess who the sponsor was for this movie??? I think I counted like 3 or 4 other cars that weren't Mercedes. Also, the cliché older actor, younger actress is still alive. Remember Sean Connery & Catherine zeta Jones in entrapment? Anyway, I gave it an 8 for effort, a 4 for execution, which makes a nice 6 for an evening of entertainment, but extremely forgettable. Could have been better.Best regards,Raf",6,2,5,1 April 2011
Jurassic World," Jurassic Park: The Reboot
","So, let me first say that... this is NOT a bad movie! I know, most of us were somewhat skeptical about another 4th franchise movie since **ahum** Indiana Jones **ahum** which I refuse to acknowledge exists. But anyway, I also had my reservations and was not really excited for this. But I went anyway without any expectations really.The good:Chris Pratt... I mean obviously. I'd almost watch it again just for him. He's definitely on the right track with his role choices and I hope to see more of him. Great mix of fun and action. Could be the next John Mclane or Indy if he wanted to. Jurassic Park memories. The beginning of the movie, where everything is just fine, you really get thrown back into the whole hype of dinosaurs. It's not on the same level as the actual Jurassic Park era but the soundtrack helps a lot. Still one of my faves.Special effects. OMG, it just all looks so realistic. Very impressed and not too much as would be very ease to go overboard with this.The bad: Story. Bad is not really the best word for it, it's rather safe than bad. If you haven't seen the movie yet but think about what the storyline will be, 9 out of 10 you'll be right. So nothing really out of the ordinary happens, although there are a few WTF moments for sure.Open ended... You all saw this coming right... you have to leave room for sequels if this one makes some dough. And it sickens me... but hey, chewing out sequels just for money is what Transformers are all about so. So yeah, I'm glad I saw it and it's a fun, somewhat brainless, action family movie. If you're gonna see it, do it in a cinema, just to hear the deafening roars!",7,6,20,13 June 2015
Big Fish," One Life , a million story's
","I saw this movie today and I had certain expectations when I sat in the movie theatre, because I know some of Tim Burton's work ( Batman , Sleepy Hollow , Nightmare before christmas and Beetlejuice too I think... ) and I really like his view on fantasy and imagination. I didn't really know what this film was about so I just went and saw it. I must say it's really really good! Gave it a 10. The perfect storytelling movie... I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. But I'd recommend it to every person that has a touch of imagination and likes good movies! The story itself is about one man, who everyone likes because he can tell pleasant story's and is a likeable guy... and so his life goes. Also nice romantic feel to it.To end I just wanna say this film is wonderful and my expectations for another tim burton movie are gone because he has my respect that it's gonna be a good movie anyway...",9,0,0,22 March 2004
Dark Shadows," A little bit of everything and a whole lot of NOTHING
","Meh... that was our reaction when the credits rolled after seeing Dark Shadows. I wasn't even planning to go see him in the cinema, but my friends wanted to see him and just went along. Afterwards, they liked it even less than me, which was funny. Everyone is talking about the collaborations of Burton and Depp. I dunno, IMO they make only movies for themselves and if the public likes them, they got lucky. Separately they are brilliant and both have great movies. Together, something happens... every movie is 'different' to say the least. I think Sleepy Hollow is still their best one yet, and I don't think they can top it. This one however... I'm never going to see again. Because what is it about, do we even have to think about this one? Why did they even take time and money to make it?? Is this what people are waiting for I wonder. OK, short overview: Visuals were great as we've come to expect of Burton. Depp is a great actor, but stuck in a terrible roll. Eva Green is as hot as they come!! The red dress!! The young girl, who I recognized from Kick-Ass is growing up nicely... I know she's fifteen, but you can already tell she's gonna be a beauty in years to come. I actually liked her performance best of all, until she became a *spoiler* at the end when the whole movie was ready to be put out with the trash. What sucked? Everything else... story? no Plot? even less Idiotic chars? Too much! So to conclude: better watch the old goodies once more and keep up the dream of their perfect collaborations. Best regards, Raf",4,2,4,20 May 2012
Happy Feet," Everyone saw Casino Royal and too Happy Feet, they took their kids with them...
","I read this line(Summary) in a review once and for me, it explained the reason why this movie made more money than Casino Royal at the box office. This is for me a perfect example off a Christmas holiday family movie. The story is fairly minimal in terms of the Humans vs Pinguins. The thing that makes the movie good is for me the singing !! Offcourse the singing, every time you see those penguins going at it, you just keep laughing and laughing. Thumbs up for the voice actors : Hugh Jackman, Nicole kidman , Brittany Murphy and last but certainly not least ROBIN WILIAMS !! He makes the movie funny off course, with his Ramon character stealing the show. It will never be anything like a Pixar animation movie but it's still very entertaining. Also the graphics are of the highest quality again. ( the snow storm !! ) and I like those cute little penguins... oohhhI have one negative point I like to add. The way they wanted to mix the 2 story lines : on the one hand you have all penguins that sing their song, one who can't and tap dances his way into a girl penguins heart...and on the other hand you have the political matter of the humans that are responsible for their fish shortage and that has to be stopped... OK OK , no problem.. in the end the movie worked... but the way the had to pull strings to make the 2 stories into 1 again was pretty lame ... releasing a penguin with a transmitter after he's captured..come on...But aside from that I found it a very amusing, romantic, funny, family animation picture for the whole family !!8/10",8,2,4,12 December 2006
