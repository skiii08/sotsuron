First Man," A Major Letdown
","You couldn't invest any emotion into these characters because the actors and the director didn't invest any real emotion into making it! Very poor cinematography and some of the worst special effects ever. I understand they were trying to give us a 1960 - early seventies feel but it ended up looking more like poor production value was achieved. This movie had a chance to be great and even when the story gave them easy situations to tug at your heart, they still failed to deliver!",5,22,38,14 October 2018
