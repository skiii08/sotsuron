First Man," Total Waste of Time ... AND MONEY!
","Boring, boring, boring.... first and foremost it was not an accurate portrayal of actual events. Poor Directing and the worst acting by Goslin made it one of the worst films I've seen in a while.If you rent it at Redbox for $1.50, you are still wasting you money. Very sad that such a large amount of money was spent on making this movie to fall off into oblivion.
Hollywood has lost tune with America and movie-goers, way too political and most asinine when it comes to 'political correctness!' Maybe one day they will realize people go to the movies for entertainment and not their sick ideologies.",1,3,9,22 January 2019
Aquaman," I Liked It!
","I liked this movie... it was exciting, kept me engaged, and the graphics were awesome! The story line was good... a bit corny though. Even still, it was worth the money.",5,0,0,22 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Not a Family Movie...
","Well... the stench from Hollywood has reached an all time high with this one. It didn't take long after the movie started to realize the language had already turned me off. I was thankful we had no children with us.
The story line was very good, but, as usual, Hollywood can't seem to offer America anything but filth.
Very disappointed with the stars in this movie even allowing them to write such mess for them.
I wasted my time and money on this one... Hollywood has just got to do better...",1,82,208,23 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Great movie... dialogue lacking...
","It was good to finally see another sequel and the anticipation was about to kill us to get to the theater. This was a good movie, great characters, great effects, and a somewhat good story line. Some of the dialogue was a bit lacking, almost corny. However, this being a lacking part of the movie, we found it to be engaging and exciting. The end was great and we left satisfied having purchased our movie tickets.",7,2,14,4 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Best sequel yet!
","I am one that hates to see sequels because they all seem to let you down, however, Avengers: Endgame delivered on the spot. It's thrilling, adventuresome, full of nail-biting excitement, happy one moment and then... sad and tearful as well. This movie is worth the time and money you spend to see it. After Endgame, I do wonder how the Avenger's sequels/new story lines will be like... even still, I am a fan!
(its a much better movie than a lot of mess coming out of Hollywood these days).",9,0,1,22 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Exciting All The Way Through
","Loved this movie! Kept me hooked and on the edge of my seat. Photography and special affects were masterfully done, acting was superb... my one disappointment was the ending. Just another ploy from Hollywood to milk movie goers out of more money. Instead of just doing a sequel they chose to bait and switch... even still, I had a good time at the movie. Not sure I will want to go back for the second part, loosing a bit of trust in Hollywood... very sad.",8,1,2,23 May 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Bravo! Bravo!!!
","This movie was a bit off the beaten path for us... but it drove deep a feeling of compassion about love. I would not doubt there are many who have in their youthful pursuits found a liking to a fellow chum. We may surprised to learn that many have trotted down the path only to allow fear to keep them from finding happiness. Morally, I have in the past felt it was wrong, but I am not one to be a judge... we must allow others to live their lives and not interfere, for in doing so I think we hurt ourselves more than them.
This was an excellent movie and should be seen by all...",10,4,9,23 May 2018
Logan," Exciting, powerful
","I've always like the Wolverine character and was excited about seeing this movie. I enjoyed this movie but was a bit taken back with how depressing it was through the entire movie. Still, packed with a lot of action, it kept me on the edge of my seat. I would have preferred a bit more realistic approach to making the movie with futuristic cars, stores, etc... remember, this is 2024. I liked the performances of each character, they were superb! I also like going back seeing movies more than once, I will probably go back on this one for a second time... but I think I will let it be then.",4,1,5,30 March 2017
Kong: Skull Island," A Journey Into Pure Excitement
","Whew! I almost could not get out of my seat after the movie. I was emotionally drained, physically weakened, and just plain numb... it was awesome!!!! The graphics, the sound track, acting, and story-line was perfect! I am not really a fan of Samuel Jackson and his character was status-quo for what he normally plays, but, he was believable and a strong part of what drove the movie with an exciting story-line. It was really great to see John C. Reily playing a major role in this movie... it was long over-due and shows what an outstanding actor he is. In fact, he put the icing on the cake in this movie.Kong is a movie I can watch again and again...",8,0,4,30 March 2017
Black Panther," Most suspenseful!!!
","I really enjoyed this movie... it was well worth the price of the tickets.
It took me a few minutes to come down off the high from the graphics, story line, acting... everything!
I will be getting this one for my own personal movie collection and watch it a bunch times over!",8,1,2,16 July 2018
Mother!," Forgetable...
","The promotion for this movie stated that Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem gave 'unforgetable' performances... and rightly so they did, but this movie is one that you will want to forget!
It was a total waste of two hours and money. A two hour stay at a bar and the money spent on a drink would have brought a lot more entertaining.
Director Darren Aronofsky should be barred from Hollywood and arrested if he ever tried to come back... he deceived the movie goer in using two top named actors to produce a very poor story line. A movie that should be thrown into the Hollywood cistern of excrement that they seem to produce without forethought or intelligence.",1,0,0,18 September 2018
