The Blair Witch Project," Rare gem unspoiled by weak ending
","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]It seems to me that horror films have evolved over the past 20 years to the point where the writers are forced to rely on pretty superstars running from a masked villain and directors are required to have buckets upon buckets of fake blood and intestines on standby.All in favour of a change, raise your hands.I thought so.'The Blair Witch Project' is an oasis in a desert of pathetic, half-thought out chop-slop flicks and is destined to stand out among such greats as dePalma's 'Carrie' and Friedkin's 'The Exorcist'.  The reason I say this is simple:  Nothing like this has been done within recent memory.  The concept itself is so unique that the directors very well could have let the concept 'coast' the film along, but instead they chose to make it a character study and it paid off.What really made this film great was the sense of impending doom that slowly crushes the spirits of the three characters.  Several scenes in the film such as the scene in the abandoned house and the discovery of a certain item hidden within a bundle of twigs are sure to go down in cinematic history.My only problem with 'The Blair Witch Project' was the ending, which seemed to be rather 'tacked on' and personally speaking not all that scary. However, the rest of the film does not pale because of it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting the bejesus scared out of them.10/10Nathan Taylor",10,1,2,2 August 1999

","Well, I've got to hand it to director John McTiernan: either he has incredibly high hopes for this film or he underwent a brain transplant from aliens from the planet Moronis.  Apparently he thought a film with the name 'Eaters of the Dead' wasn't vague enough, and by changing it to a name that has next to nothing with the actual story (more on that later)....well, you get the picture.The 'script', based upon the novel by Michael Crichton, is thoroughly awful, which is even worse, given what potential it had.  Perhaps it wasn't the script that needed work, but we'll never know when we've got an actor such as Antonio Banderas reading them in a drab, monotonic voice that only he can do.  For instance, one of the subplots that was only mentioned but never explained was Ahmed's 'prophecy' to kill the bear-people.  Yeah!  Speaking of 'profits', I wonder if this movie made any?The only two redeming features that this film has is that it pumped some desperately-needed funds into the Canadian film industry (The bulk of the work was shot in Vancouver Island), and occasionally, the cinematography stands out (esp. the scene where Ahmid 'learns' the viking's language, and replies to their insults with the retort that is sure to stand out in film history:  'My mother... was pure woman from a noble family!  But at least I know who my father was, you pig-eating son of a w***e!')That line bumps my vote from a 1 to a 2.",2,1,3,4 March 2000
