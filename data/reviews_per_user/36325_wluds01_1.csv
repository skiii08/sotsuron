The Longest Yard," Pathetic Trash
","Bad, awful, cheesy crap. The acting is lame, so lame probably because the cast is made of hacks from WWE and NFL. The characters are assassinated with dreadful acting and Sandler try's to hold it together but in the end even he stinks! Storyline is OK, but the acting is so terrible that whenever they go for an emotional scene to capture the audience it comes off as cheesy. Even the humor is 3rd rate; I can only imagine that they let the WWE meat heads write the comedy as well. Oh yeah, what is going on with Courtney Cox fake breasts...looks like she got hit in the back by 2 scud missiles.Overall it is complete and utter trash, even the rubbish man would be offended if you put this out in your weekly garbage collection. Sandler must be hanging his head in shame over this one!",3,1,3,4 June 2010
