Casablanca," Classic-blanca
","This classic love story really delivers. I may even venture so far as to say it is the best romantic movie of all time. Humphrey Bogart's acting is once again phenomenal. He delivers his lines soÂ…coolly. He is very suave and is equally matched by Ingrid Bergman. They have so much on screen chemistry. The flashbacks to Paris add to the whole romance. The audience gets the treat to see their love come full circle. Their final moments together rip your heart to shreds. However, even if you are not into romance as a genre, there is still something to be gained in 'Casablanca'.Curtiz's direction is understated and subtle, but that is one of the movie's strong suits. He doesn't let his personal style and need to creatively express himself overpower the plot and take away from the movie. Curtiz's direction adds to the movie and compliments it beautifully. Furthermore, the screenplay is the second cherry on top when it comes to the production.The scene where the national anthems are dueling each other is powerful. The story is strong because it is about the war but also not about the war at the same time. 'Casablanca' instead focuses on people indirectly involved in the war and how this moment in history shapes them.'Casablanca' is all-in-all a very well crafted movie. A must see.",8,1,2,10 March 2010
Citizen Kane," Just Plain Greatness
","'Citizen Kane' is truly fantastic. It is understandable why film critics often cite this as the best movie of all time. The way the story is told is particularly interesting. The story is a mesh of other people's point of view. It makes Kane's life a sort of puzzle that the audience tries to piece together. Kane is a very complicated and enigmatic man so the puzzle seems to be a never-ending one. I am not quite sure if Kane being based on a real life person (the famed publisher: Hearst) adds or detracts from the story. It is definitely worth mentioning though.Orson Welles' direction takes us on a never-ending cinematic roller-coaster. It seems as if every technique in the book is crammed together. If you want a lesson in direction, watch this movie. Welles also works actively with both the foreground and background, creating a rich scene. All layers of this film remain in focus and a lack of cuts showcases just how fluid the camera is. Low-angle shots often make ceilings the backdrop. This is a rather strange and unique technique that is nonetheless interesting.The cinematography is excellent but it is really the story that sticks with you. Kane realizes in the end that he became everything he set out not to be. 'Citizen Kane' shows us the evolution of childhood innocence to the sobering reality that experience leaves you with. Whether or not Kane is a monster is for you to decide.",10,1,2,10 March 2010
The Birth of a Nation," Great Film that doesn't leave you with a Great Feeling
","Let me begin by saying that 'The Birth of a Nation' was cinematically a great film. It is truly amazing how J.W. Griffith made this historic film that is nearly a century old feel like a contemporary masterpiece. An excellent use of parallel editing, a complicated series of cuts, and the variety of wide and close shots make this film a must see if you want to see where 'epic' films first began. The color hand painted onto the frames helps set the mood and evoke emotions in the audience. A great example of this is where the scene of Atlanta burning is painted red. The shots of the battle scenes are so grand. It is very evident that so much planning among so many people went into the making of this movie.This movie also has a high degree of verisimilitude, mainly because it is based on nonfictional events. Because the audience knows the gist of what is going to happen, the director uses the lighting and variation of shots to create suspense. An example of this is the Lincoln assassination, where John Wilkes Booth is creepily shrouded in shadow. The score also adds to the anticipation.A troubling part of this movie is how it goes beyond being politically incorrect to being downright offensive. Though Griffith gives a disclaimer saying that his intent is to be historically accurate rather than racist, I believe the movie went above and beyond in a negative way. The racism is sickening and the historical accuracy is questionable. The K.K.K. is depicted as being heroic, saving society from the 'black savages'.Though 'The Birth of a Nation' made great strides cinematically, the outright racism made the movie's achievements secondary in my reflection of the movie. The length of the movie, though ground breaking in 1915, was excruciating. Watching this movie is an endurance test not for the faint of heart, especially since the second half of the movie is utterly sickening.",5,3,5,27 January 2010
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'You can't fight in here! This is the War Room!'
","Kubrick seems to turn everything he touches into gold and the same goes for 'Dr. Strangelove' This film is plagued with fantastic acting, flawless direction, well built/chosen sets, and a timely theme. Kubrick masterfully turns a movie about the Cold War into what he has termed a 'nightmare comedy'. This comedy carries with it a heavy message about how foolish war is and how flawed and foolish the people who start the wars are.The history behind this film is also very interesting. Many lines were dubbed over and scenes cut out of sensitivity to the sudden Kennedy assassination during filming. Mentions of 'Dallas' were dubbed over to 'Vegas'. The original ending—the pie fight—was taken out all together.'Dr. Strangelove' is a must see. It is rightfully cemented as a modern classic due to Kubrick's genius.",10,1,2,21 April 2010
Fargo," Awesome movie, ya?
","'Fargo' is a refreshing film. The audience is thrust into this spoof of a crime movie, full of goofy accents and eccentric charactersâ€”which are oddly spot on to people in real life when you think about it.These Midwesterners are not all apple pie. They are sinister and complex. The people of small-town Bainerd, Minnesota treat the triple homicide (and growing) nonchalantly. In fact, there are really no hysterics that are expected to accompany a murder spree anywhere in this movie.The movie makes you question your reaction to things. You laugh during violence and gore and you almost feel guilty for your unusual and 'immoral' reaction. The movie has a quiet beginning, a loud body, and a quiet ending. 'Fargo' is truly an enigma and a fantastic movie.",10,0,0,5 May 2010
The Graduate," Visually Amazing if you can Stay Awake
","Let me first start out by saying that visually, 'The Graduate' is amazing. The color is so rich and the variety of shots keeps film buffs interested. The layering in the scenes is excellent. There is a shot of Ben (Dustin Hoffman) through a fish tank with Mrs. Robinson standing in the doorway in the background that exhibits this layering. There was also interesting choices in framing. Characters who were talking oftentimes had their heads cropped off or the camera on the back of their heads.My main beef with the movie was Dustin Hoffman. He just doesn't do anything for me as an actor. And on top of that, the movie was long, slow, and boring.Another strong suit is the amazing soundtrack and how music is effectively intertwined with the plot and transitions. The film also does a good job of showing the generation gap. The ending at the church and the fight scene are amazing and almost make up for the pace of the rest of the film. Overall, I have mixed feelings on 'The Graduate' and recommend others to watch the movie when you're tired and in bed so the slow pace won't annoy you.",7,0,2,21 April 2010
Psycho," I'm going Psycho for Psycho
","Woah! 'Psycho' is truly amazing! Everything you have heard about this undeniable classic is true (well only if you have heard very good things, that is). The script is amazing. The acting is flawless. 'Psycho' truly delivers in every sense of the word. The sound in this movie is spot on, adding to the visual experience (when Balsam is attacked, for instance).Hitchcock's directing is so skillfully done that 'Psycho' is definitely his masterpiece. Janet Leigh screaming while being attacked in the shower is a scene that defines a whole genre, and it's Hitchcock's work that has made that scene, and the whole movie, simply timeless.'Psycho' is particularly good (and troubling to audiences) because it steps back from the fantastic beasts who stalk towns. Instead of vampires and werewolves, 'Psycho' has a much more realistic (and thus haunting) beast: one of us. Instead of gore, there is suspense. Instead of lengthy action scenes, there is more character development. In addition to this, the movie is perfectly cast. Anthony Bates plays Norman Bates. His subtle and creepy demeanor is unsettling.'Psycho' is truly a great psychological thriller that is a classic for a reason. Do not hesitate; go watch this movie right now.",10,1,2,7 April 2010
