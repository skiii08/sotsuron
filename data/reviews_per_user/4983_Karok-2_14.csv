The Blair Witch Project," Not as scary
","It wasn't as scary as I thought! I thought that this psicological fear would be much worse! I have to recognize that Daniel Myrick and Eduardo SÃ¡nchez, have done a great job in this 'different' excellent movie. I like all the actors job. They really seem desparate in the movie. The bad thing about it is that I heard too much about it! I heard that the directors made all the tricks, and that the actors were improvising, that sometimes when you are watching the movie, you are thinking what were really those people thinking? The scary part is that they really were there, that the trees aren't fake and that when they run, they really run, and that when they are hungry they really are. I have to recommend the movie though, because is a good movie to watch. if you are tired of Hollywood, and if you are tired of movies in general, becuase you think they all look the same. This is your oportunity to go and see that young people is worth in this Industry. an 8/10",8,0,1,27 December 1999
Casablanca," A good one!
","Well. I have to recognized I enjoyed this movie a lot. It diserves everything it got and more.The actors are just wonderful, and I bet all the today's actors would like to be a part of a movie just as half as good as this one. Not many of them will have this luck!Is a movie that everyone that loves cinema should watch!",9,0,0,14 January 2000
Erin Brockovich," Julia shows the world that she is an actress besides just a movie star
","Today I've seen this movie. Is sure going to be one of the bests ones in the 2000. Maybe is not going to be worth to get the title of the best! But sure nobody will be able to say that this movie is not funny and very interesting in some kind a way.Well, maybe the plot is kind a easy, but that helps to understand the movie. Well, maybe is not so exciting, but is just the way life it is. Is an extraordinary history about a real strong woman. Julia Roberts should really get nominated for this role! I know is soon to say something like that, and of course the movies that show up to the world that soon are just forgotten for the Oscars! But I give my vote for Julia Roberts to be the first star of the 2000 movies to get that award! She just has shown the world that she is not just a movie star! SHE'S A GREAT ACTRESS!!!Albert Finney and all the actors do a real good job in it. And even that I think is a little too long. IS A MOVIE THAT SURE SHOULD BE SEEN!",8,0,0,21 April 2000
Taxi Driver," Robert & Jodie
","Robert and Jodie. Those two names make a bad movie a good one. And directed by Scorsese. I don't know why, but I guess that Scorsese is one of those directors that you can understand his movies, just when you are so mature, or you really know what is he talking about, or you really like this kind a movie. I'm saying this because I just think I'm not old enough to watch that movie. Or maybe is just that is not my time movie, or just that I really don't know what is the movie talking about. I'm not from America, and that may affect. I have to say that I just watched because Jodie is in the movie, and whatever she does is good. And she did it with one of the best actors in our times (DeNiro). So I had to watch it, but I wish I could understand that movie a little better! Oops!",7,0,2,24 December 1999
American Beauty," Well described characters
","One of the best things of this movie is their characters. The man that knows that has nothing to loose and wants to play hard. The woman that just worries about getting money and be important and show it to all the people, and make them know that she has a good life. All this reasons is what makes this family do not work very good!
The daughter that feels out of her family, and her popular beautiful cheerleader (very, very, very, very common in American Society, and every day gets common to any other country).The neighbors. The crazy mother, and the strict general, and his weird but intelligent son, that doesn't know how to leave his house.All this definitions is the way I've understood this movie, and how all this people is trying to get their goal, even if that has to destroy other peoples life. In this movie, everyone sees reflected in some way. The younger people, more or less has felt like the daughter at least once. And looking around, this family is what society asks for, but Lester! He would be the trouble maker one!Great screenplay on my reason, and very well played for each actor! I don't know if it deserved all the nominations that has gotten, and I don't know if is the best movie of the year (I haven't seen all of them, so...).
Well, I wish my best luck to all of them!",9,0,0,12 March 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Great Job again
","Steven Spielberg has shown again his wonderful talent in Saving Private Ryan. Personally I don't like to watch warlike movies. They always look the same, they always say the same, they are the same thing each time I see one. But Steven Spielberg just has told us that a warlike movie might be a GOOD movie. He did a great job at the Schindler's list, and he did it again in Saving Private Ryan.The reality of this movie is even scary. It makes you think what would happen if a war would start now, and what would I do on front of somebody that would shoot all my partners. Would I be strong enough? He is asking that to each person that watches the movie. He is asking that. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? That is why I think is a scary movie! It looks so real that makes you think you are one of those people, and that in any time, the guy next sit will get shot. Or even that yourself is about to get shot.
Not everybody is ready for a war. Most of the people is not ready for a war. And many people is not even ready to see one of the best movies ever done!I can't believe Shakespeare in love was considered better for the acadamics. That was a shame. Shakespeare in love is not bad, just not as good.In my opinion; IF YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE READY TO SEE BLOOD, TO SEE VIOLENCE, TO SEE THE WAY WORLD WAR II WAS, GO AND ENJOY THE MOVIE AT THE SAME TIME YOU THINK THAT THE HUMAN BEING IS THE MOST DUMB THINK IN THE EARTH. And thank Steven Spielberg to let you know it!",8,0,0,19 December 1999
Schindler's List," There is no love story
","There is no love story good enough to be able to be compared to this movie. The love showing up on this movie, is much bigger than any story! The love for keeping people alive! This is one of the best movies ever done. We all have to thank Steven Spielberg to be so great and being able to this all of this movies! SO THANK YOU. He did just as great in Saving Private Ryan! The images in this movie, makes it closer to the time that was done. Makes it more real, more believable. The photography is just ART! the acting is great. the screen play is material to read at Junior's classes (not the Scarlet letter, or however is called that book!). Is movie that should be watched at History class, because shows IN A PERFECT WAY how it was, and if it doesn't then better not know what really happen at that war! We just have to sit down and clap to this movie, that I would call THE BIGGEST MASTERPIECE ever done for a screen. Thanks Steven for giving the humanity the oportunity to have this movie!!!!",10,9,13,17 December 1999
Annie Hall," Nice couple of hours
","The best think of this movie is definitely its different, magnificent and funny screenplay. You don't see movies like those that is just about a relationship between a guy and a girl and their problems and their sweet moments, and is not even a relationship that it ends like a love movie usually ends.I actually discovered Woody in this movie. The subtitles about what they are thinking, or the moments when he is looking or talking to the people of his past life is just amazing! So I think I'll try to watch some more movies about this guy because I think that with his movies I will see what cinema should be like. Fantasy mixed up with reality, where the directors and writer thoughts are important to the plot and were the audience is being entretainned and having a nice couple of hours!",9,0,0,31 March 2000
There's Something About Mary," American surprise
","Well, well, well. Is kind a surprising that America is capable to laugh at this movie. Is that kind a movie that you think nobody will ever do. But is hilarious. Is funny, different and of course the most important in those movies. Entretaining. I really enjoyed it and laugh it at this movie. I could promise that is the best comedy-romantic movie I've ever seen. And has got Cameron Díaz, one of the most hot hollywood girls now. And the good part is that she doesn't care to fail in the ridicule! Remember the gel part! Well, I recommend to see this movie to everyone if got the opporunity, is funny, very funny. A good way to spend an afternoon, because after the time that takes the movie, you could spend the rest of the day just talking about it and keep laughing. That is the good part of the movie. You keep laughing, hours after the movie, even days and even months! I recommend it to you!",7,0,0,19 December 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Funny and sad
","The humor of this movie is not making fun of the horror of the war. I would say that is completely on the other side. This movie made for me this horror even worse were the love of a father is stronger than soldiers, than war, than anything else. This movie is just sooo wonderful the way it mixes sadness and humor. The way it makes you laugh and the way it made me cry like a little kid at the end like I never did in a holocaust movie (Schindler list of Saving private Ryan, were Spielberg made a good representation of the war).The only thing I didn't like about this movie is when at the end Roberto plays about the sadness that people feels to put in the movie an American guy. It looked just like he was looking for the Oscars or something. When all the people is crying they put an American over there and Sofia Loren screamed Roberto!!! and Life is beautiful sounded a couple times more, once by Helen Hunt giving it to BEST ACTOR. At least I have to recognized I liked better than Shakespeare in love! Is much better than that one!Well at least he was funnier than Almodobar this year!",9,1,2,10 April 2000
Titanic," Social event
","Titanic! Now, when people hears that word doesn't think with the ship Titanic anymore. Now the people thinks about Kate Winslet or Leonardo DiCaprio, some even think about James Cameron. And some just think of the movie itself. But is not the Titanic anymore, is the movie of Titanic. People knows better Titanic than even Gone with the wind. It was just a great social event. Some people loved it! Enjoyed the great direction of James Cameron, with the beautiful soundtrack of Mr Horner, and the great visual effects reconstructing the terrible event of the Titanic. Some other people thought it was another stupid romantic film (the lovers of Van Damme thought so) and some just hated it because of Leo! (jealousy reasons? they will not recognize, they'll just say he is the worst actor they ever seen (not true!)). What is for sure is that nobody got out of the movie theater without an opinion. I have to say that not much directors could do what Mr Cameron did. But we should congratulate them, and we should congratulate each actor.Oh, I just think that if James Cameron can make sink the Titanic again! He should have taken care that Kate Winslet and Mrs Stuart don't have the same color eye. So you can see that one has blue eyes and the other has brown eyes! Well, if you haven't seen it yet. Congratulations! Not much people can say so!",9,1,2,3 December 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," The best
","Has been for many years my favourite movie, and Jodie became my favorite actress. There is a great movie, thanks to Mr Hopkins and Mrs Foster. They did great performances, and the Oscar was deserved. All movie deserved the five major award. I enjoy the movie every time I see it again. Jonathan Demme did a great job directing this thriller, that keeps you interested about it since the first moment you hear a conversation in the movie. Is just great!",10,1,1,26 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," The best ending
","I just gotta say that I gave a 10 at this movie just for the sooooooo unexpected ending, that is the best of the movie.Haley Joel Osment and Willis and Collette are doing very good interpretations (even Willis has done a good job). The sad part is that has been one of the lossers of the Oscar night. It deserved the best screenplay for Shyamalan at least! But, Oh well, it has gotten the surprise of the year, and sure will be one of the movies of all time! Of course if the ending keeps in top secret ALWAYS!",9,0,0,2 April 2000
The Matrix," Great visual effects
","Well, I heard a lots of bad stuff about The Matrix, and i heard a lots of good stuff. I think is just great. It has a very interesting the theme that has touched the movie. Who knows if is real this world? But I don't think this is the important part. We all have seen many love movies, and they might be good movies. But in visual effects, this is real art!! Why should just be romantic movies be considered as a good movie? Okay, probably the interpretations of The Matrix are not the ones at the Schindler's list. But the visual effects makes that movie an important. Because made what cinema was made for. ENTERTAIN! And sure that the movie got this part!",8,0,0,26 November 1999
