Skyfall," Definitely in my top 5 Bond films for sure.
","I just saw Skyfall yesterday afternoon. Two hours and twenty-three minutes later I came out of the theatre in a very enjoyable mood and was nearly giddy, but reserved. It was the first time in several years that I've seen a good Bond movie (obviously I'm referring to Casino Royale as opposed to its sequel Quantum of Solace, the latter of which was below-average in my mind). It's not often that a Bond film starts off immediately with a lightning fast action sequence that has more than its fair share of tense moments culminating in a sudden, shocking climax before the intro (speaking of which, the intro sequence was good, but it could've been done a little better), but Skyfall does it so well. The last thing I'll say about this without spoiling anything is that it just shows viewers that sometimes 007's 'superhuman' abilities fail him or don't materialize as originally intended.Now onto the acting. Craig, as demonstrated in his first two films (more CR than QoS though) is a hard-nosed Bond who portrays the spy as one who still has something to prove and can still play a large role in being a spy. Craig acted very well in this movie, arguably his most significant experience surpassing what he did the first time he played the role. Javier Bardem played one of the best villainous roles in any Bond movie and was an equal to, if not superior than Craig was. The fact that his character's prime motive was a fresh one as opposed to the classic 'taking over the world' mantra gave credence to his portrayal of a shrewd, confident and evenly-tempered psychopath (yes that's a bit of an oxymoron). Not very many love scenes in this movie and the Bond girls aren't seen very much, but perhaps that's because the 'real' Bond girl is M. Judi Dench plays one of the largest roles of her character in the history of Bond films (if not the largest), and the film explores the intricate relationship between 007 and herself. She even gets in on the action a bit, as has previously happened in The World is Not Enough. Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney also had notable roles in the movie.Lastly, I did mention that this would be in my top 5 Bond films. I'd place it at #2 on my list, as my favourite after yesterday is still Goldfinger. The last thing I'll mention in this review is that Goldfinger fans would be delighted with some key moments in this movie.9/10 - A job very well-done.",9,3,11,14 November 2012
