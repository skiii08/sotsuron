It," Omg why such a good rating.
",I don't know why this movie has such a good rating. It's a good movie only for kids hoti age 15!!! Not for adults attttt alllll ... total wastage of time.,6,0,3,15 September 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Omg what was that
","I'm a huge Leonado DiCaprio & Brad Pitt fan. They're the best actors but what was this movie. It was so so so boring and unbelievably long! How did it get this good rating idk!
Yes the acting was just perfect but there was no story!!!! Not recommended at all. Literally slept in between. Only let 10 minutes were good!",3,10,14,24 August 2019
The Lion King," No comparison to the original
","This is a total rip off of the original Disney!! Few very good dialogues are missing. The charisma of Muffassa is missing , it just doesn't have that feel , that music , that aura that would grip you , hook you and take you in total trance of the grandeur of the king. Nothing like the real thing !!!!",2,2,2,17 March 2020
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Deepest impact.
","I cannot imagine or think of another movie that literally left me so devastated and speechless than this movie. Extremely moving especially the last scene. It's impact didn't leave for next so many days.
What you sow, so shall you reap!!!
Must watch",10,1,2,13 May 2019
The Lion King," So close to my heart!!!
","Even at the age of 31,, this Disney movie is just the closest thing to my heart.. as a child I never understood why it attracted me so much but as a grown up & after losing my own father... every word in this movie seems to be written for me. So intense & heart warming at the same time spiritual ... love it",10,1,1,24 April 2019
