Hereditary," Less Would Have Been More
","This film had potential to be a brilliant psychological study of family tragedy and the failures of communication. Instead it devolved into a second rate creep show that overused gore, death and unexplained revelations. For so much trauma to be visited upon one family gave me horror fatigue during the last half of this film. In a review by NPR, the writer and director Ari Aster, says that he, 'wanted the film to function first as a vivid family drama before I even bothered attending to the horror elements'. In this aim he certainly does succeed, owing to the brilliant performances of the cast and moments of writing genius. Aster says that the turning point of the film was 'designed to operate like a chute that opens up under audience and kind of drops them into hell'. Aster also says in a Vanity Fair interview that he 'wanted to make a film that served as a serious meditation on grief and trauma.' In these objectives he ultimately fails because he uses the gimmick of horror, inspired by Rosemary's Baby, Psycho, and other similar movies, to try take us down a rabbit hole of the supernatural, instead of exploring the non-supernatural horror of their situation. The real terror is invoked by the riveting performances of the actors, especially Toni Collette, whose character's grief and suffering touched me more deeply than desecrated graves, headless corpses and hovering evil monsters ever could. Alex Wolff also gets kudos for his heartbreaking depiction of teenage angst taken to the extremes. But, the supernatural elements of the film left me completely cold. It seemed like the easy way out for Aster who convinced me that he didn't know where to take the real horror that such misfortune can engender.",4,3,4,3 March 2020
John Wick," Two Hours of Plot and Character Inconsistencies
","That was one of the all-time worst movies I have ever seen. And a sequel is coming out in 2016? That adds insult to injury. So many things in this movie just do not make sense: Here are just a few: 1. Vigo and Iosef are right: It was just a car and a dog Now I am an animal lover but the dog does not justify in any universe the wanton destruction of dozens of people brutally and in public places. 2. A real Vigo would have killed him and never let Wick go after his son. After spending all that time and money to prevent his own and son's murder? His actions when he catches Wick make no sense. Just off him. Oh yeah then the rest of the movie can't happen. 3. Kill a priest in front of his church in broad daylight? Rubbish. 4. Suddenly Vigo is no longer afraid of Wick?5. Marcus has no reason to set up his expensive equipment and elaborate stake outs to not kill Wick. 6. A hotel that is so out in the open about being a hotel for gangsters? Really? And men dripping blood show up at expensive hotels all the time?7. A hotel that has a doctor whose stitches and staples gangster wounds for a living? So unbelievably disappointing I just want to blame someone - and get my money back. But alas, I only have myself to blame for sitting through it.",1,15,29,27 December 2015
Knocked Up," Don't Let The Title Fool You Into Thinking This is Just Another Tasteless Puerile Comedy
",This is a completely delightful and warm movie. It sometimes plays a little stilted but that only endeared the movie to me more. A friend of mine mentioned this film to me several weeks ago and I sneered at him thinking it was probably just another tasteless toilet humour flick.Yes it is crude but at the same time it portrayed real people with real pain and real joy. It presents the turmoil of trying to make it through a difficult situation without any guidance whatsoever and somehow getting through it all it same. I loved the understated way the actors move through the action and the lines. This downplaying actually underscores the tragic comedy and gives the film an easy and believable naturalness that is rare is most mainstream movies.,8,10,21,4 December 2007
Vanilla Sky," Mostly Misses The Mark - But The Film Was Oddly Compelling To Me
","(Warning: Some Spoilers)I do not think that this movie accomplished the filmmaker's goal. The whole mystery unraveled in a rather melodramatic and pedantic way at the end. It was bad science fiction (but not as bad as 'Return of the Clones'). It is as though the filmmaker thought it was unthinkable for the audience to be left with the impression that the character David Aames (played by Tom Cruise) could possibly have murdered his lover. The movie might have had a lot more impact if the question of what was real and what was dream had been left ambiguous. Tom Cruise had some fine acting moments in the film, but in many ways he merely reprised the emotional outbursts that were so fine in 'Fourth of July'.The movie seems to be about a life reformed. I think this is is one of the film's main messages. Witness when the character Sofia says to David during the evening they spend together: 'Every passing moment is another chance to turn it all around.' But David Aames never does take advantage of that opportunity. His life, a loveless one, essentially ends the next morning. The movie also seems to be about a perfect love realized. But this is only on the surface. It is actually about a love never realized yet acted out in someone's fantasy anyway.In his fantasy Sofia tells him that he never should have gotten in that car with Julia, his stalker, that fateful morning. That is the opportunity he missed to turn it all around - to resist the temptation to join Julia. Instead he could have moved forward in a reformed way instead of giving way to vanity. The character of Julia, is, I imagine, supposed to represent a mirror to his vanity and the selfish lovelessness of his life.The movie revolves around one sexually charged but unconsummated night with the only woman one man will ever truely love and the chase to capture and hold the fantasy of that love, which remains unfulfilled. But it is about hope too. When David Aames confronts Sofia in the club and implores her to share her thoughts and feelings about their relationship, she, in my opinion, tortured but compassionately replies, 'No I can't. I will tell you about it in another life...when we are both cats.' This is the great hope of the movie - that somehow their love transcends this life (or this fantasy). In some way true love never dies and will manifest itself in an afterlife and beyond.",Null,0,0,11 April 2003
