The Rock," One of the greatest Action films in existence.....
","The Rock is without a doubt one of the best films. This is how all Hollywood Blockbusters should be made! Great plot, great acting (especially Connery and Harris), all topped off with some of the most intense action scenes ever. Pity how Micheal Bay hasn't made anything worthwhile since....DoNjUaN",Null,3,4,23 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Have you all been brainwashed or something....??
","How on Earth can anyone say this is the best movie ever..? This has to be the most overrated film I have ever seen. Prior to seeing the movie, I checked it's rating on the IMDB scale (best movie site ever), and to my surprise it was rated in the top spot. I mean, that makes it better than Pulp Fiction right?. Wrong. Let me say first off that LotR is a good movie. The direction is flawless. Very pretty. I fell in love with New Zealand. My main gripe is that the story is boring. Stupid actually. Not enough to sustain my interest for the three hour running time. The Visual Effects are not spectacular. Pearl Harbor, in my opinion has the best visual effects in a feature film. I even enjoyed the flawed Pearl Harbor more so than LotR, even though Pearl was deeply flawed. But this all just my opinion, and I just cant stand people saying this is the best film ever, when The Usual Suspects is.",Null,0,0,4 January 2002
Armageddon," People, People... Listen to yourselves...
","To everyone screaming 'This movie sucks!', lighten up... This is a summer Mega-Blockbuster, which means leave your brain at the door and buy an extra-large box of pop and enter into pure escapism entertainment. Entertainment. Isn't that the reason why us humans go to see a movie?... To shut out the real world and the problems associated with it and just escape. I found this movie 'entertaining'.. not a 'life changing- spiritual awakening' motion picture. Sure the movie had a shaky script.. sure the movie has implausible outcomes..( a shuttle exploding in space(?!)).. but really who cares... Micheal Bay is a great director and a great story teller to boot.. see his most recent work 'Pearl Harbor' to see how amazing he is.. Out of ten I give 'Armageddon' a seven.. it promises non-stop action and it delivers. And for those who want to bitch about how the movie is unrealistic and stupid, damn, get a life and just enjoy entertainment at it's costly best...",Null,1,2,11 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," Amazed again...
","I saw Pearl Harbor again today, and left the cinema amazed like I did the first time I saw it. I don't normally see a movie twice at the cinema, usually wait for it until it comes out on video; but this movie is incredible. No doubt about it. The Re-enactment of the attack at Pearl is spectacular. But you all know that. Congratulations to Micheal Bay for doing an amazing job. Only Steven Spielberg I believe could match his brilliance. I also loved the cinematography and the filters used during the attack. Nicely done. May be a little too patriotic at times but I've seen worse. I've been reading reviews in papers from critics trashing Pearl, yet these people are the same ones who gave 'Titanic' five stars. Titanic is crap. You know that and I know that. >Pearl surpasses it by a long shot. See the movie and you will be impressed.",10,4,9,30 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," Beautiful, amazing, corny and predictable film..!!
","(!!Possible Spoilers!!) Well I just got back from watching 'Pearl Harbor' and I must say I am in absolute awe.. This definetly has to be one of the most amazing films I have ever had the privilege to witness.. The CGI/effects throughout the movie is amazing.. no.. Mind-Blowing!.. The aerial scenes are terrific.. Better than those of Star wars fame!! Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) have really outdone themselves and surely will win the Oscar For Visual Effects.. But what really got my juices flowing was the initial attack on 'Pearl Harbor'.. It was an eerie site following the 350 Jap Zero's on their way to bomb Pearl Harbor.. And once the bombing commenced all one could do was just sit and stare.. It was so realistic that it felt you were right there getting hacked to pieces by zero fire.. Kudos go to Michael Bay for staging the 40 minute attack sequence. Michael Bay is definetly one of the world's best action directors.. The action in this movie is absolutely amazing.. from the scenes of the Battle of Britain to the DoLittle raid.. amazingly crafted.... But what really spoils this film from being one of the great motion-pictures ever.. is the love story.. which is very ordinary.. and VERY cliche'.. The script is penned by Randall Wallace who co-wrote 'BraveHeart' and in his latest outing he hasn't delivered the goods. It was sadly just too predictable and corny. I won't go into detail about the love triangle because I don't want to spoil anything worth spoiling. Overall this is way above your average Summer 'Blockbuster'. The script is your ordinary Summer Blockbuster fare, but what seperates this gem of a film from the rest of the pack is the action which surpasses anything in modern cinema. I know that's one hell-of-a statement but it's true. The 'critics' (who I honestly think should go f*** themselves) have blasted this movie from every penetratable angle. Please people don't let these hypocrites deter you from witnessing the spectacle which is 'Pearl Harbor'. It is by far the best summer movie in the last decade and I highly recommend it. Just stay comfortable for the first hour so the love story can unfold then prepare to be dazzled.In my opinion I think this movie deserves 8 out of 10 on the imdb scale.. 2 off for the predictable love story..",10,4,9,19 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," Not the best film ever, but extremely entertaining none the less...
","As I browse through IMDB (best movie site ever), I notice not a lot of people find this movie very favourable. The story sucks; laughable characters; overlong and boring. And 'Titanic' won best picture. Sure, the resemblance to 'Titanic' is strong throughout, but I believe it surpasses it. James Cameron and Micheal Bay are two minds that think alike. Can't develop characters very well but they sure can develop destruction scenes very very well. Yes, in 'Pearl Harbor' the love story is pretty bad, but arn't all Hollywood love story's bad?. I believe foreign films potray them best. But if there is one thing that Hollywood can do well, it's blowing up stuff real good. 'Pearl Harbor' has, in my opinion, one of the most spectacular action sequences ever comitted to film. It sure beats 'Titanic's sinking ship. So yes, I do recommend this film. One more thing... why is 'The Lord of the Rings' holding the top spot on the IMDB scale?.",10,0,3,27 December 2001
Black Hawk Down," Great...
",I thought it was a great film. Got off to a slow start but once all the choppers are en route to the destination it never lets go of you. I didn't expect the violence to be so in your face. I felt as if the RPG's were literally flying all around me. The best movie which shows that war truly is hell.,10,0,0,27 February 2002
