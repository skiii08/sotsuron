Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A big, cartoony heart, it offers more on every viewing
","'Smile, Darn Ya, Smile,' sings every cartoon creature in Toon Town, in the over-the-top second act production number as Eddie drives into town. It is a song from a 1931 Friz Freleng cartoon. The whole countryside is singing, including the trees, the sun, the flowers and the birds. It is so ridiculously happy, so infectious and outrageous, you can see how a sourpuss like Eddie would be annoyed. But it makes me incredibly happy each time I see it. It's exactly what cartoons represent in this movie -- pure joy.It is a wonder that such unbounded silliness can suddenly bring tears to your eyes. I speak of the scene when Eddie Valiant is flipping through some newly developed photos, to find pictures of his dead brother and partner, taken before he died.The movie does not play this scene for cheap sobs, but tenderly and humanly. Eddie shows little emotion on his face, and the music is sweet and simple. Suddenly we know what everyone was talking about when they said, 'A toon killed his brother.' The photos show he was more than a brother. The slow pan across his brother's desk show his whole life, just as Hitchcock did for Jimmy Stewart's character in the first scene of Rear Window. The story? Here was a business partner who had shared Eddie's successes (successes now lost in dust and drink), and a best friend who could hang out at the beach with Eddie and his girlfriend, sing, drink and have some laughs. He was someone Eddie probably didn't know how much he loved until he lost him. Now he was alone, his business gone, and his life over. He couldn't return to his old work -- Toons -- because that was the world of joy he had lost. He thought that joy had betrayed him.The extravagance in details, especially the small ones, are what sells this movie. The sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the humor is in every line and gag. It's pretty funny to see Eddie snag a free ride on the back of a trolley car with a bunch of school boys. It's more funny when Eddie hops off and thanks the boys for the cigarettes.The melding of the real world and the cartoon world is brilliant. Cartoons have a natural effect on their surroundings. Cartoon logic makes complete sense in this picture; when Judge Doom tries to trick Roger out of hiding with his 'shave and a haircut' routine, it's hilarious because it's true, and it's suspenseful because it's true. It's perfect.It is an homage to every cartoon ever made. The saxophone player and the dancing brooms giving a bow to Fantasia... And a swell, multi-level gag that most people miss: When Eddie takes pictures of Jessica 'playing patty-cake' with Marvin, the two *really are* just playing patty-cake. What a gag. But when Roger flips through the photos, they move so quickly that the actions in the still photos become animated. What you are looking at, in fact, is the very first kind of cartoon -- the animated flip-books that once sold for a few pennies, long before the first movie was ever made. It hearkens back to the earliest days of cinema and animation. It's simply sublime.This movie does have its flaws; it drags during the warehouse scenes, for some reason. But watch for the many sub-references to the world of cartoons, and the rich sets, the beautiful color, the flawless editing, the physical humor. The movie revels in the rich history of cartoons, bringing together characters never before seen on the same screen. Such a movie will never be made again. It is old-time cartoons' last bow. It's a marvel.",10,0,0,27 September 2005
Being John Malkovich," Clever, original and always funny
","Once I was involved in the story, I was so absorbed by the story and the characters, I forgot where I was...Where I was was Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center tonight, at the premiere of this extremely original and funny film.Seeing the trailer two weeks ago cracked me up so much I went to and watched it again and again.  And this morning, to my surprise, I read in the NY Times review that it would be playing tonight and tomorrow.Boy, am I glad I showed up early and hunted down a spare ticket (it was sold out) at the New York Film Festival.  Cusack, Malkovich and Keener perform wonderfully, as do Diaz and the supporting cast.You probably know what this film is about, and if you don't I won't spoil it, but whatever you've heard, take a chance and see it.  It is a winner and I predict a nomination for Best Original Screenplay Oscar, and possibly some acting awards for Keener, who turns in a first rate performance.A strange inner life takes over the story, and it truly challenges the viewer to think about the strangest and even profound questions of reality, love, existence and life and death.  But mostly it was goofy, surreal and very clever.What a treat it was to see the actors walk the red carpet, pose for the cameras and whisper to each other on the way in to the show.  And it was a privilege to ask the writer questions in person at the panel afterwards. I'm definitely joining the Society and will make sure I see more films this way.  It is a great evening out.(While Mr. Malkovich walked down the carpet, I got a few laughs from the crowd by yelling, 'Malkovich!  Malkovich!'  Those who have seen the movie will understand.)",10,1,2,1 October 1999

Life Is Beautiful," The true-life Chaplin connection
","You will read many comparison's in these reviews to Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' (1940).This is not a coincidence.  Benigni has described 'Life is Beautiful' as an homage to Chaplin's film, which he has seen many times.In fact, the number on his prison camp uniform is the same number on Chaplin's uniform in 'Dictator.'I was charmed the first time I saw this movie, and knew of course it was a masterpiece, but on second viewing the film had much more power.  I took my mother, who loved it, and now want to see it again.  A lot of little details can go by if you're not careful.   See it again if you have a chance.Benigni's generous love and affection have such power.  I truly feel sorry for the poor louts who think it is a 'comic treatment' of the Holocaust, or that it uses the Holocaust as a 'backdrop' for comedy.  This is simply not the case.I rearranged the letters in 'Life is Beautiful' to create the following ironic anagram:  'Lie a bit, if useful.'",9,2,3,3 March 1999
WALLÂ·E," Sadly, this movie did nothing for me.
","I was expecting a thoroughly enjoyable film, and am sorry to say it is not even marginally enjoyable. What is all the hubbub about? Nothing about this movie charmed me.
