Come and See," A True War Film
","We live in a time where war movies are always about a hero. They show how a soldier risked their life to save a friend how heroic they truly are. This movie whether we like it or not, glorify war. They make it seem like a good option for someone to thanks part of, they basically say 'Hey there might me death but hey you will be a hero at the end!' and we know that is now hoe it goes. Some of these movies could even be called war propaganda in a way. They paint war as a glorifying moment in a soldier's life but it is extremely weird for a movie to show the other side of the war. Not the soldiers who trained and became heroes but the people who suffered because of war and this is exactly what Come and See does.Come and See is a movie that I could not get out of my mind for a moth. This is a masterpiece with a deep antiwar message. In the movie, we follow Florya a young Russian guy who decided to join the military during the Second World War. He does not become a hero at the end but a victim, what most people who go to war are. We follow Florya through a period of time where he lives the most terrible things a human being could possible experience. He is forced into situations no one should be put through. His life becomes a tragedy in its purest way. Not in a single moment of the film do you see a hero or you feel like Florya might have a good life after. This movie focuses on the real side of war, the bad side, the terrible side which most people in war experience. This is what I would call a war film, and the best one I have seen. It opposes war in all of its aspects not separating the good or the bad side but simply showing the bad that war does to people.",10,5,5,2 May 2017
