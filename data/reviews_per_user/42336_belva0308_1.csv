The Longest Yard," Lots of heart!
","Don't underestimate this film. It is funny but it has a lot of heart. Adam Sandler has a way of doing that with his movies that I full embrace. It reminds me of the way Burt Reynolds did his films. You always feel like you are 'in' on the joke. Not just watching it play out, but a part of it. I need to mention that there is more to this picture than meets the eye too. I don't want to give it away, but you aren't human if you don't shed a tear. Watch without agenda and enjoy!",7,0,0,5 July 2019
