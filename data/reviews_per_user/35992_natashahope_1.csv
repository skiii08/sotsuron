Men in Black 3," Spielberg-Sonnenfeld Dementia or Their Great Fall.
",We loved parts I and II and it was enough. Right now we will not watch them anymore. Part III killed all our love. If you cannot make a good part III do not do it at all. We were in anticipation to see a great entertaining show... Man in Black!!! IMAX 3D!!! It turns to be extremely boring! Dialogs about nothing. Repulsive looking fortune teller in an idiotic baby cap and etc. Just waste of time and money. Best part is funny speech on the alien language of the agent O and the first scene with security staff in the Canaveral Space Center. My dad asked: How come all these great actors agreed to play in such a bad movie? My dad thought that actors can choose what to play in the US. We are done with Spielberg and director Barry Sonnenfeld.,1,30,68,27 May 2012
