The Avengers," Finally, Joss Whedon gets the recognition he deserves!
","Finally, Joss Whedon gets the recognition he deserves...After creating some of the most compelling, intelligent and entertaining TV shows of all time - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse - he brings the same mastery of writing ensemble casts to the big screen, and people see what he is capable of.Just give the guy a blank cheque, and let him write all the sci-fi and fantasy he wants.Far from being immature entertainment, his previous masterpieces all respected the intelligence of the audience, and contained characters that were so likable and charismatic, that it was impossible not to tune in each week.Here, he does what he did in Buffy, Angel and Firefly, but he does it with a massive budget, and some of the most famous superheroes in the world. Who else could have written and directed a film starring Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and Captain America, but doing them all justice? Not only that but also doing justice to Nick Fury, Hawkeye and Black Widow. His trademark aptitude for writing strong female protagonists really came through with Black Widow.Go see it - then watch all of Buffy, Angel and Firefly.",10,7,14,8 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This isn't a bad film, just different....
","Honestly, a lot of the negative reaction to this film, aside from it's flat dialogue (a well known trait of George Lucas films, but also present in the original Star Wars), came from the fact that people had rigid expectations. They wanted a space western, full of Han Solo type characters, epic classical warfare, and a visual style that was identical to the original.Lucas however had always planned the Star Wars saga like an epic novel; the era of the Republic was always going to be one that was markedly different from the era of the Empire. He displayed a remarkable understanding for how history unfolds, and how humans doom themselves. His goal was also not merely to produce entertainment, but actual art; something that spoke about timeless truths. The Jedi may not articulate it very well, but there is a depth of real philosophy at work under the entire film. One of the sources of inspiration for him, was the idea that certain truths are beyond culture, and have been expressed many times in different ways. He wanted to express them again, in a way modern people could understand, no matter what their cultural background was.It isn't actually a bad movie.Compared to some recent attempts in Hollywood to craft a perfect film, painting by numbers, with scene after scene of music-video like cool (but shallow) ideas, which results in utterly bland entertainment - this is actually interesting. It is interesting because it does not try to be perfect - no film can be; by not trying, you often end up with something more imaginative. It has actual substance.The Jedi order, the Republic, the galaxy, it's planets, it's species, it's people - they are all caught in a time of change, yet have no understanding of the forces shaping their lives.The Jedi order, hold a historical position that is like a mixture of Roman legionary, Knight Templar, or martial artist monk. The influences underpinning them are surprisingly diverse. They share traits from many different cultures; monastic communities from medieval Europe or Asia, mysticism and philosophy that wouldn't be out of place in ancient Europe, ancient India, ancient Persia, or ancient China.In other words, they represent a certain tradition that has been present in all human cultures, in all times. They represent the best of that tradition, and not the corruption and dogma that it so often became associated with.The force they fight is nothing less than the problems that our civilisation deals with to this very day. They fight the worst tendencies in our lives, the ones that determine whether we are happy or not - whether a politician is corrupt or not - whether we hurt others or not - whether we are comfortable in our own skin or not - whether we can maintain a relationship or not. Anger, hate, fear, bigotry, self-doubt; all the psychology that we know collectively as 'evil' - and the people who use it. These forces manifest as corruption, exploitation, slavery, war, racism and are exploited by opportunists and fanatics - the antithesis of the the Jedi order. It is the story of the decline of a civilisation, and the decline of a single man. In short, it is actually a very good film.Worth your time, worth deep consideration, worth multiple viewings.",10,6,12,21 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Why the Star Wars prequels deserve due recognition....
","People habitually criticise George Lucas.A far cry from the days when he was seen as an untouchable cultural genius on the same plain as J.R.R. Tolkien, Gene Roddenberry, Joss Whedon, or Stan Lee.For all it's flaws, the prequel trilogy, is one of the most important cultural works of our age. I think George Lucas, in spite of perhaps not being the best writer of dialogue, is something more important: one of those writers who manages to articulate the timeless truth about how we should live. J.R.R. Tolkien was also accused of being someone who couldn't write characters, yet his book, firmly grounded in subtle English culture and morality, inspires billions.At a time when civilisation is mired in self-doubt, bombarded by a huge variety of opinions.... people (especially adults exposed to competition, blame, guilt and shame) have lost their sense of what is good and bad in life.Is there such a thing as right and wrong, or are these just culturally-instilled? The Romans thought that keeping slaves, and having them kill each other for other people's entertainment was fine. Who is to say they were wrong, in an age when 50 different religions, and 500 different cultures, all say different things? This is an example of the confusing reality that we live in, with every TV show, film, comic, novel or game, having a different opinion on history and morality. It's pretty easy to either lose self-respect, or hate others, in a confusing storm like that. Either way, they lead to anger, hate.... and a dark life.The Star Wars saga, and the prequel trilogy in particular, show how a man can lose self respect, and become an addict. Someone who fears everything, and who's fear becomes hatred. Anakin Skywalker believes what many people now believe; that we can change ourselves for the better, become more powerful, take control of our fate.The truth is that we have no control over what will happen to us in life; all we can do is try our best to be happy, and not be afraid. A person who thinks they can control the world, will inevitably hate themselves, because the universe is too big, with too much momentum, for us to ever have certain power over it. The illusion of the self-made man makes us hate ourselves and others.Anakin's long journey toward self-hate and hate of others, concludes in Revenge of the Sith.The peaceful Jedi order, for all their many flaws, were a people who strove to accept themselves and others. They tried to do some good under unfortunate circumstances, and to understand the mysteries of life a little better. They did not believe in the cult of self-improvement. Their training was not to become the ultimate swordsman, or the greatest seer. It was a constant journey of learning, and not everyone agreed on what path was best, with Jedi like Qui-Gon Jinn and Mace Windu taking different approaches. They tried to do what good they could, embraced difference, and the spirit of the law. They were never perfect, but strength of character can give a person respectability.Anakin had different ideas. His personality was torn. Perhaps in many ways he was a victim of his own prophesy. Having been told he was the chosen one, he perhaps believed that he could change the galaxy. Fundamentally, where other Jedi knew the limits of reality, Anakin believed that with enough power, a person could shape their own destiny. This has never been true. The last straw that finally broke him, was the idea that he could prevent his wife's death, if only he could learn force magic powerful enough. Think about this. Nobody can prevent death. It was futile, and failing, he would blame himself where others wouldn't.Like an addict, or people suffering from the neurosis of modern life, he experienced a thrill, followed by the inevitable shame. Like so many people, he sought to explain his pain, and his dread by projecting it's cause outside of himself. Such people reason like addicts. Addiction is a mental problem as much as a physical one, and does not require a drug. The circle of blame widened and widened, until his views were so different and illogical compared to a healthy man's reasoning, that we couldn't understand him anymore.Why didn't Obi Wan feel guilt and self-hate, for failing his apprentice? Because, for all Obi Wan's flaws as a man, he never believed he had control over the world. He just tried to never wrong anyone. He refused injustice when he noticed it. He did his best.The Sith played on the weaknesses of their times, and rode the current, hardly needing to do anything. If the Confederacy won, they world gain a droid army. If the Republic won, they world gain a clone army. A million short sighted politicians with no strength of character could not see the weakness of their system.A film will never be perfect; rather by not trying, they often become more interesting. Attempts to craft perfect films, with no blemishes, have resulted in some of the blandest 'experiences' in living memory.",10,5,9,21 October 2012
