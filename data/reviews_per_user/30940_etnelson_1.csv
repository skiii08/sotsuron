Hereditary," This is what a movie version of 'Click Bait' must feel like...
","Suffice to say, that the hype was the biggest compelling factor in me seeing this movie. I expected this generation's 'Exorcist'. Honestly, The Visit was far scarier than this. Actually, the word 'scary' does not apply to Hereditary. Specific points of disappointment:
<ul><li>Very slow in the beginning</li></ul> : I'm ok with character development and setting a backstory. This was just slow
<ul><li>People doing unreal things:</li></ul> : You find a dead body in the attic, YOU CALL THE POLICE!!!
 : Actually hearing the husband basically say this caused me to laugh
<ul><li>The big effect at the end is a life size nutcracker doll</li></ul> : REALLY!!!Just points that stick out. I left the theater, solemnly feeling that I just got 'Rick Rolled'.Oh well, the popcorn was good.",2,7,16,13 June 2018
