","It's just a brilliant movie about junkies, but it's soundtrack makes it almost perfect. If you watch this movie (I strongly recommend you to do so), you'll never ever think about using drugs. Movie doesn't shows how needle pierce the body, or how junkies scream (IMHO that's the movies main advantage), it only shows how people feel and act.",10,0,0,1 April 2003
