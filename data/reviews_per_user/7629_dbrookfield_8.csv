Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A contrary opinion
","I like most of Quentin Tarantino's work, a lot.  And this movie has a lot to recommend it, particularly interesting camerawork and photography.  You don't see a whole lot done with overexposure and backlighting like you do in this film.  The quirky, Mamet-esque at times, unusual dialogue is at times a bit much for me but I got it in the cartoony way in which I am sure it is intended.  But I think some of the quirkiness of QT's films comes from Quentin himself, and this is a guy that is a bit too self involved for his own good much of the time (at least on the talk shows that I've seen). Ultimately, this movie suffers from that in some of the excrutiatingly slow, labored speech that is intended to be dramatic.  Maybe this is in itself part of the cheese factor that this movie embodies, but between interesting bits, action, and comedy are vast boring wastelands of 'Eyes Wide Shut' slow paced dialogues.  Making so much of the dialogue in this pace simply isn't good art in my view, there is a whole palette that can be used.",4,3,6,19 April 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Trix Are For Kids
","Having seen (and enjoyed) the Harry Potter movies, and to a lesser extent, the overlong Lord of the Rings movies, I decided to join some friends for this bit of fantasy.I do think it plays well as a kids movie, but as an adult, it's just a bit too slow-paced and cutesy for my taste. The characters were thin and underdeveloped and the action scenes tended to fall short for the most part, at least in comparison to other films in the genre. I'd recommend you check out Potter and his Goblet of Fire instead.The ending, in my mind, unfairly rewards the youngsters. Thousands strived long and hard for this particular goal over the centuries and died trying, while the kids reap the rewards simply because they are fulfilling some arcane prophecy. The message seems to be, 'no need to work long and hard, kids!'",4,2,9,10 December 2005
Insomnia," Kept me wide awake
","This is the first decent film I've seen in a while and just felt the need to comment.  I saw the original foreign version of this a couple of years back and enjoyed it, and I think they did a good job of translating it into a solid American movie.  Definite Hollywood budget, but with at least a bit of an independent/art feel.  Many scenes seemed to be lifted note for note from the original, and I have no problem with that.Pacino already has the look of someone who has been up for days, and he's got the cop thing down to a science.  Based on the trailers I was a bit afraid that Williams wouldn't be able to pull off his part, but I was fine with it, and Swank has a good supporting role.We need more like this and less of the Sum of all Fears crap that Hollywood spews out.",9,0,0,4 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," fairly solid, but long
","I guess it is not surprising, given the excitability of people, to see LOTR instantly thrust into the top 250 films of all time.  But for myself, as a relatively impartial observer, I find it hard to give this film a 10, 9, or even an 8, for that matter.  I do think it deserves credit for an excellent production, filled with fantastic creations of creatures and fanciful matte and CGI work.  I could care less whether it is an accurate reproduction of the original story, as it's been over twenty years since I read it.I do have a pet peeve with films that are too long, or slow paced, and although I think this was done well for it's length, it was not without some overlong passages.  I was not alone on this, as I could hear the passive aggressive sighing of those around me who were uncomfortable with some of the duller segments.  Frankly, I feel any director who feels the need to push the 3 hour limit has some serious ego issues.The ending is particularly unsatisfying, as one might imagine going in, as the story has not come to closure at this point in the saga.  The audience was loudly disapproving at this point.  Cries of 'oh come on' and 'you've got to be kidding' rang out as the screen faded to black. Finally, I found the actors for Boromir and Aragorn to be too alike, as they are of the same phenotype, the same face, hair, facial hair, and the clothing was not exactly dissimilar.  Kind of confusing for a moment or two, and totally unnecessary.",7,0,0,24 December 2001
Resident Evil," Horrible, boring
","Okay, I went in knowing full well this would not be great cinema, but I was just looking for a good time, some action, some Milla, and I was banking on the fact that a couple of reviews said this was at least the best of the 'game' movies.False.  This movie makes Final Fantasy look like Shakespeare.  Bad, bad, bad.  I was frightened exactly, umm, zero times.  This movie is entertaining only in the same sense that Plan 9 From Outer Space is entertaining.  The attempts at both horror and scifi were quite humorous at times.Completely unabsorbing.  Occasionally I would be stirred to interest with some development here or there, but it was all too brief.  Milla-wise, the beginning has a flash of nipple.  If you hold out to the end you'll get a near Basic Instinct moment.  In between you might want to go to the lobby and check out some posters of upcoming movies.This movie would have benefited from some extensive rework on the story, the storyboard and less clothes for Milla.  I mean, as long as you're going to be gratuitous, you might as well do it right.",2,0,0,17 March 2002
Hero," Ah-ha, so-so
","Yep, great look to the film, some great cinematography and use of color.Great visual style.  And there's some meaning there, and some love.  So there are a lot of elements there, but ... ultimately it's just lightweight packaging used to enclose a bunch of fight scenes.It just doesn't move.It ain't no Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring, that's for sure.4/10",4,0,1,27 August 2004
The Thin Red Line," The Long Boring Movie
","If 'Saving Private Ryan' was four star, this should be about one and a half. Pitiful mistyped cameos by Travolta and Clooney.  Well filmed, but too long, too slow, tried to do to much.  Lots of heavy spiritual voiceovers by some pseudo enlightened redneck that just never came across to me.  The action scenes were fine, but the attempts to balance with the other side of the 'line' failed miserably in my estimation.",4,0,0,13 December 2001
Donnie Darko," minority opinion
","The film came highly recommended, but it simply did not hook me.  I love movies that give me something to think about, but the actual moments of the film, the characters and dialog, have to entertain me in some way, and DD was pretty mediocre in this regard.  I loved Mulholland Drive, so I clearly can enjoy movies that are puzzling, thought provoking, and fairly well outside of the mainstream.  I liked some of the subplots and ideas, but overall to me this was a lackluster film.  I'm surprised that it rated as highly as it did, but hey, it happens.",4,5,10,4 June 2003
