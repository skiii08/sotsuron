Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What's wrong with you negative people?
","You've got to be kidding me. So many people hate this movie. It was a let down compared to Star Wars. Well for crying out lous, what isn't? Pretty much LOTR and the Godfather. This movie was good.Episode 4: Quest to save a princess. Episode 1: Quest to save a planet!I don't see this weak storyline, it was definitely alright.It had a sweet battle sequence between the Trade Federation and the Gungans, all those lasers bouncing off those shields and the droids marching in, albeit Jar-Jar's segment of battle sucked and was unrealistic at best. Pod racing ruled (even if they did a lot of building up to it but hey, it's gotta be longer than an hour and a half)and the Jedi lightsaber duel was good, too.What did you guys want? A Jedi and his apprentice go on some rag-tag ship in search of something else? That's exactly the same as the original SW! They try something a little different and it's rejected.",8,1,2,17 May 2002

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Wonderful pixels and inane writing
","When I read some of the newspaper reviews abut this movie being coarse and juvenile, I didn't care very much. And I was going IMAX so it would rock. Well, they were right. I didn't want to believe it was written for and by 12 year-olds. I cringed often. And it was still good. During the fights I got chills. They have upgraded the visuals and the Blu-Ray should be incredible.They really made this movie dumber than it needed to be. I almost feel like I have to ADMIT to liking it as a whole, signifying shame. Overall it is a drunken movie. Sensory candy, utter sweetness and brain rot.In theory they should construct a cohesive plot to answer questions. After this attempt I wish they would just leave unanswered questions. A three minute scene attempting to verbally spell out the entire plot is banal and adds nothing.My main objections are as follows. One, many of the elements are unnecessary and just made me long for the next explosion. A lot of it is tediously repeated from the first movie, such as the parents and air strikes. The twins are racial stereotypes but more vulgar than many, adding nothing but annoyance. Oh and our armed forces 'gently' disregard civilian leadership in an emergency situation, which was comforting. Who needs the president and NSA when we have the ubiquitous solution of BRINGING THE RAIN!And this is nothing new but time continues to be disregardedÂ… transport from California, the East coast, Diego Garcia, and Egypt flows to about a brief intermission from any one to the other.At times it feels like an over-sized, overdrawn advertisement for two of the most bloated government-supported organizations: the military and General Motors. Deleted scenes will surely have Bumblebee leading a feel-good 'This is ooooour country!' moment while saluting the flag. This is not a huge departure from the first movie but it is gratuitous. Speaking of... Megan Fox basically is a video vixen in this spectacle. Female roles are terrible, we even lack the young techie.The new Big Bad Villain, in an apparent nod to General Grievous, entered one battle for about 5 minutes and died. The new Super-Sized Decepticon was destroyed by a convenient Super-Size gun in range of Egypt. Oh and the Decepticons are apparently powerless against tanks and aircraft. Or humans on foot if they're main characters. Even hill peoples have Soviet flak cannons and RPGs. And everything was made secret after the melee in L.A.... right. I still can't give it a poor score.Basically it's a ridiculous $200M shark with LAZERS!!! And some plot attached as a lamprey, straining to complete a story arc. They really could have done a better job with what they wrote down but the pixels are breathtaking. It's like a thrill ride with long boring waits, or a video game with long boring cutscenes. Waiting for BD.I have renewed respect for Beast Wars and Beast Machines writers, and I wish they had the same technology and money.",7,1,4,4 July 2009
Gangs of New York," Excellent and resonant
","Within the first few minutes this epic builds up great tension. The proud Irish take a serious battle march with music that still sticks in my head. Their battle royale with obstinate natives does not disappoint, and is actually more brutal than the civil war battles in most movies dedicated to the mid-1800s.For the film, it was very well done. I had the Blu-Ray and the quality looked fine to me, apparently it was not a good transfer. Daniel Day Lewis is a savant, DiCaprio holds his own, Neeson maximizes his short time and Jim Broadbent playing Boss Tweed is tremendous. The set has to be one the best ever and the extras show that. The ending was a good twist on what was expected earlier in the movie.For the general content, the rough melting pot is old New York, and a libertarian experiment, perhaps dream. I won't belabor it but the actual police are ignored or beaten and the gangs police down to blatant discrimination. Taxes are privatized, fire squads are fueled by theft and pride, and hookers are seemingly everywhere.",10,1,3,22 September 2009
Gladiator," Not very good at all
","It's a good 'train' of a movie, but it kind of derails . I loved all the characters except Russel Crowe. I prefer it when action stars are not one of the 10 most beautiful hollywood stars. I couldn't root for him but his performance was bad anyways. Good guys escape from death too much (forest scene). Please hollywood, give me something more like Die Hard where he comes out of the experience bruised and bloodied rather than just kick everyone's butts on his own in a matter of seconds and is pretty much unscathed. If I personally were facing chariots, I would aim a little higher with my spear, you know, impale the guy guiding the horses instead of aiming for the wheels.  Sheesh.",7,1,2,2 June 2002
