Casablanca," To sum up, a little overrated.
","Even though I did enjoy the film very much, I have to say that there was a lot of overacting, and the characters aren't defined very precisely. In my opinion, just a romantic flick.I think that the best actor in the movie was Peter Lorre, followed by Claude Rains. Bogart was pretty good, but he is exactly the same in all his other movies.",Null,2,4,15 December 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," # 1 Top 1000
","I just can't believe it still is after LOTR! Lord of the Rings was great, no doubt about it, but greater than Lawrence of Arabia? This is truly a movie to remember. Peter O'Toole doesn't do his best at it, but it still is fabulous. Amazing performances by the turks, arabs or whatever (especially Omar Sharif). The screenplay is rank 10, not to mention the photography, and, yes, what no one cares about, the Film Editing. That's what I have to say. It's a 10.",Null,0,1,10 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Definitely, worth seeing
","Before talking about the movie, I would like to make some remarks about some thing said. When I entered the movies, I KNEW I was gonna watch something that lasted almost 3 hours (2h 50m to be precise), so the only thing that annoyed me about the length was that I was starving.I also knew that I was gonna watch a movie, not watch a book, so I didn't expect it to be exactly like the book.But, I didn't enjoy at all the final speech that Sam and Frodo had. I just looked at the trees fighting and all that to find out that Sam had been talking nonsense all that while. Happened the same in Harry Potter: 'touching' dialogs with soft music.No words about Gollum, nicely made, I understood him, as I understood Frodo being nice to him. Maybe Frodo realized that HE was gonna be another Gollum. I didn't even notice the trees being mixed up with the war. If I had seen that war more than half an hour (JUST-A-WAR) I would get the hellaouta there. And when the trees came down from the forest to destroy the giant headquarter, I couldn't help to smile like saying victory!
I have seen better scores, the were sometimes uncomprehensible. I sometimes was trying to find out if that was a scottish instrument or a violin.Bull's eye when someone said quasi-Irish, quasi-classical.In the beginning the acting was a little unconvincing. Spoilers: We MUST remember that in that time -the middle ages- the fire did not extinguish because of water. In the battle, when the rain starts, almost everyone has torches. If that actually happen, I just do not know how the fire kept alive. If some can explain that to me... Also, I don't know if hobbit can have some kind of a disease, that changes their height but sometimes they went underneath a horse, and, what kid can pass underneath a horse. The weren't THAT small. Sometimes very predictable. Who DIDN'T know that in the forest they were gonna be saved by a giant tree. Sort of a clich√©. Great movies, the spoilers only made me laugh.",Null,0,0,4 January 2003
