Casablanca," Movie Never Loses Tension
","A classic. Terrific actors, without exception (I wished Peter Lorre's part were longer). Great production. Incredible direction (look out for the head profile shots at the end, at the airport - that still remains striking). Unsurpassed screenplay. I could have taken a star off though because plot developments are glossed over too quickly. Bogart holds it all together and was never better. Movie captures the tension, desperation, romance and sacrifice of wartime magnificently. Only other criticism is over-use of music to manipulate viewer's response. Too noticeable. 
SPOILER ALERT. As examples of rushed developments: Rick's change of conviction and Ilsa's acceptance of Rick's decision that he is staying and she has to leave with Laszlo. Hard to believe she would be comfortable leaving it up to Rick to tell her husband she was leaving him. And her decision not to meet him at the train station in Paris (after she learns Laszlo is still alive) because she thought Rick wouldn't leave Paris without her - well, to be kind to her I guess she believed that Rick would get over her in time and didn't need to know she was married (I realise Laszlo wanted to keep their marriage a secret to protect her but I think in the circumstances Rick could have been told). Because the movie never loses tension any of its shortfalls are masterfully hidden. It all passes in a whirl and the movie is over before you know it!
Trivia: Hitler is never mentioned. Only a portrait in Strasser's office. 
An interesting approach to the film is to look at it as Rick's ultimate revenge on Ilsa for deserting him in Paris. He really deserts her at the end. She has no choice but to go with Laszlo. Rick could have got a letter of transit from Ferrari at the Blue Parrott. Ferrari had offered one to Laszlo and Ilsa but they had turned it down because they wanted to leave together. It seems incredible looking back that Ilsa was willing to leave her husband behind in Casablanca to fly off to Lisbon with Rick. It was really only Rick who forced her hand to leave with her husband.",10,2,2,2 April 2018
John Wick," Revenge Porn
","For gamers only. Reeves makes it watchable if you're into brainless violence. I'm not, so only made it half way through.",5,0,1,15 April 2018
Gravity," Not My Kind Of Movie
","This is just not my kind of movie. Disaster movies leave me cold so I only went along for the ride and except for a couple of tense moments, it lost me. At the end, was it really resolved? I hope she landed in a US-friendly zone!",5,0,0,24 March 2018
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Genius
",Genius. Watch out for George Harrison as man lending mounts on Palm Sunday!,10,1,2,29 April 2018
Mississippi Burning," Powerful, Powerful
","Powerful, powerful movie. I' sure everyone involved in it is justifiably proud of it.",9,1,3,18 May 2018
Shutter Island," DiCaprio Is Mesmerising
",Modern Greek tragedy set in an experimental mental hospital of the early '50s. Thankfully DiCaprio and Ruffalo are there to help us get through it. Needed to be 30 mins shorter. DiCaprio is mesmerising.,6,0,0,11 May 2018
Barry Lyndon," All Show And No Heart
",A movie that relies on constant narration and an incessant music soundtrack never succeeds in compensating for the lack of any real emotional depth displayed on screen by characters presented mostly with little sympathy.,7,0,2,20 December 2018
Romeo + Juliet," Luhrmann Is A Genius
",This and the '68 adaptation are so different they don't really compete with each other. Luhrmann is a genius. This version still stands as completely contemporary. The director makes the two kids wholly believable and alive. I liked the change he made to the death scene ending. DiCaprio stands out as ever. (viewed 4/17),8,2,3,22 May 2018
Fargo," Not Exceptional
",Rarely do violence and comedy/satire go well together. This movie is not the exception! (viewed 11/16),6,0,3,18 May 2018
Nightcrawler," Plot Holes
","It's a pity Gyllenhaal's great performance is in a movie where the plot lets him down. There is ample evidence from his digital records - cell phone and computer - for the police to charge him. And earlier, you have to overlook triple murderer parking his SUV in the street neverthelone not even trying to disguise it! Otherwise, a wonderful expose of TV news.",7,1,1,25 April 2018
The Caine Mutiny," Hollywood Psychosis
",Mostly unconvincing Hollywood treatment of psychosis is over the top. Characters are really stereotypes moved around to dramatise the plot. The acting fortunately saves the film from being boring. Van Johnson solid as always but beside whom Bogart appears over-dramatic. (viewed 10/16),7,0,2,15 May 2018
Bridge of Spies," Disappointing
","Spielberg gets more disappointing as the years roll by. Here, movie is manufactured and heavy-handed. Could only stay with it for first half hour.",4,1,4,29 April 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Doesn't Bear Scrutiny
",Life/people are complicated and this movie portrays that brilliantly. But it is at times static and then bamboozles its audience with sports betting jargon and then loses me with superstition and finally a pat ending that hides any worries we might have about the characters' future. And didn't we all guess that Pat knew what he reveals at the end? Performances are great. Pity the movie doesn't bear scrutiny.,7,1,3,25 April 2018
Inside Out," Whizz-Bang
",I feel mean being negative about this movie but I am not the target audience and only got half way through it. You can see the incredible imagination and skill everyone has put into getting this together but unfortunately I wished it hadn't been so garish and whizz-bang.,5,0,4,8 May 2018
Foxcatcher," Entertaining
",Not your typical sports-themed movie. Unfolds slowly but entertains. Great acting from all three leads. Didn't recognise Steve Carell under his makeup. And the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave makes an appearance. Being based on true events adds another dimension.,9,0,0,30 April 2018
Lawrence of Arabia," Fascinating Character
","Overlong and repetitive screenplay. O'Toole is charismatic. Story followed Lawrence's disillusionment with his Arab followers but he must have been equally disillusioned with the deception of the British and the French. This is referred to but Lawrence is largely left out of it and we are made to believe his disillusionment is more to do with the Arabs rather than the politicians. I think the reverse is probably truer. To see him confront those who betrayed his ideals would have given balance to the movie. The motorbike death is portrayed as an accident. I had the impression it wasn't. In all, Lawrence was probably even more fascinating than he is here. His probable homosexuality is never referred to (his masochism is hinted at). Omar Sharif matches O'Toole perfectly. Film is worth the watching for these two performances alone. (viewed 9/16)",8,0,1,14 May 2018
Legend," Twins' Relationship Centre Of Movie
","Is there anything Tom Hardy can't do? Great performance from Emily Browning too. I liked how the film treated the relationship between the twin brothers- it becomes the centre of the movie. I find the pair fascinating as twins more than as gangsters. Btw, if you are usually annoyed by voice-over narration (as I am) hang in there as here it turns out to be a clever device.",8,1,3,28 April 2018
Behind The Candelabra," Funny, And Tragic!
",One of the funniest (and most tragic!) movies ever. Two heterosexual actors play the gay leads magnificently.,10,2,6,26 March 2018
The Number 23," Highly Irrational!
",Worth watching for Jim Carrey's performance. Incredibly well-produced. The story? Depends on your personal taste. Some people will love all the hidden meanings and fatalism of the numbers (numerologists?). But even if you're not into the character's obsession the mood of the piece will carry you along. For a plot that depends on the logic of numbers though it is highly irrational!,6,0,3,25 April 2018
Moulin Rouge!," Spectacular One-Off!
","Original, zany, lush, spectacular musical drama. A one-off. Possibly the greatest putting-on-a-show movie ever! (viewed 11/16)",8,1,2,18 May 2018
Ex Machina," Dithers
","Static setting. Adolescent-level story hides behind nerdish dialogue that isn't even 'deep' for sci-fi. Development at times slow. Cliched. Offers Asimov no competition. I love a good futuristic android story (I, Robot) but this just dithers too much.",5,4,7,14 April 2018
Grudge Match," Rollicks Along
","Delightful. Great to see De Niro and Stallone acting together and looking good. The rest of the cast are good too especially Arkin, Basinger and Hart. Script for the most part rollicks along with some witty lines. It's just great to see a screenplay based around aging actors who don't shrink from facing up to their advancing years! Perfect balance between mix of humour and drama. Also between the nostalgia of the stars' past boxing movies and the present contest. Some will probably watch because of their pairing but the movie doesn't play this up. It stands by itself.",8,1,1,4 May 2018
1917," Too Clever
","More an exercise in film-making than entertainment. Music totally inappropriate for a modern audience. I just didn't like the approach of the single camera set-up. I want to see actors interacting, not a disembodied voice off-screen. And the lack of a physical face-to-face enemy took away a lot of the terror of war. I love war movies but maybe this isn't really one! Just left me feeling flat. 5/10 for effort. (viewed 1/2020)",5,8,21,13 January 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Concept Missing
","I loved the imagery, the music and the warmth of Jim Carrey's performance. And great to see an (early?) Mark Ruffalo. But I just wonder what the concept of the movie is. Does the title come from Alexander Pope? (viewed 1/17)",8,0,2,20 May 2018
Frank," Film's Purpose A Puzzle
","Parody that unfortunately plays on our feelings. Hard to believe that main character Jon (despite film's title) is intrigued by these characters. Well-acted, direction and production good but film's purpose escapes me. Maybe reading Jon Ronson's original article that inspired the film would help.",6,0,0,3 May 2018
Selma," Soundtrack Only Sour Note
",Magnificent re-telling of struggle for recognition of black voting rights. Incredibly it wasn't awarded an Oscar. Only real qualm is the soundtrack which is all over the place. Oyelowo's central performance holds everything together. Film doen't try to be over-ambitious with result that it isn't over-blown.,9,1,4,20 April 2018
Woman in Gold," A Very Rare Movie
","A very rare movie. Besides the superb acting, a film that blends the pre-WW2 and more modern parts of the story seamlessly. Not often does a movie like this come along. Watched until end credits had finished!",10,1,3,21 April 2018
Love & Mercy," Otherwise Wonderful
",Fascinating story of Brian Wilson and his mental health issues. Let down by its pacing. Otherwise a wonderful movie.,8,1,1,3 May 2018
Sicario," Pessimistic
","Production is top-rate but some aspects of story are weak. Surely Kate (FBI) would be aware why Matt (CIA) needed her along. This was obviously withheld to add an extra element of suspense. But it's really a trick and probably like Kate we don't like being fooled! Later, I read a review that said the film is wholly pessimistic. This is very true. Kate (Blunt) is outmanoeuvred at every turn and is unable to fight back. We are left feeling helpless that government cannot do anything but play outside the rules. And all that was really achieved was vengeance.",4,4,7,5 May 2018
Titanic," Still love Leonardo
",Mills & Boon on a boat. Still love Leonardo though!,4,6,11,22 March 2018
To Kill a Mockingbird," Perfectly Paced
","Amazingly, film captures aura of the book (only wished there were more Southern accents!)
Director Mulligan paces action and actors perfectly. Case in point, watch Scout's final mesmerising scene with her father.",9,0,1,8 April 2018
The Big Short," Doesn't Tell The Whole Story But Worth A Watch
","For those who lived through it, we all knew how this ended so the story really is the why did it hsppen? And there is plenty of explanation here. Except the government is almost totally left out of the story. I read somewhere Clinton's deregulation in the '90s led to the subprime crisis in 2007/08. Anyhow, well worth a watch especially for those who didn't live through it.",8,1,1,18 March 2018
Paths of Glory," The Politics Of War
","This movie sped by - was it rushed or was I enthralled? Whatever, it captures the politics of war beautifully and it's the fighting man who is expendable. SPOILER Why is Broulard prepared to mount a case with all the ensuing publicity against Mireau? Dax seemed surprised too. Broulard didn't do it out of any sense of guilt or fairness as he makes clear in his final speech to Dax ('the village idiot'). This movie can be compared to Ray's Bitter Victory which I preferred for its non-literal treatment.",8,0,1,14 May 2018
Raging Bull," Documentary Feel Constrains Emotions
","Two things I miss in this fight movie: the actual training for the fights and any sense of real happiness. Maybe that's the characters' make-up but it produces a movie very much on an even keel emotionally. It's probably the director's constrained attempt to give everything an almost documentary feel of realism. This sucks the blood out of the core of the story. Of course, brilliant acting and camerawork. (viewed 10/16)",8,1,1,17 May 2018
Vanilla Sky," Confused Characters
",Potentially a great movie but lacks cohesion and real feelings. I was intrigued where the story would lead but characterisation was confusing. Didn't finish. (viewed 4/17),6,0,0,22 May 2018
Cloud Atlas," Confused Stories
",Got through half an hour of confused stories with actors in multiple parts and no emotional attachment to any of it. If it was all ultimately satisfactorily resolved I don't care! Each to his own taste.,4,2,5,14 April 2018
The Great Gatsby," Fabulous
","Fabulous. Over the top. DiCaprio perfect. Faithful to the book with Maguire as Nick Carraway looking uncannily like Fitzgerald himself. The book is almost impossible to transfer to the screen as language is a large part of its effect. Cleverly, Luhrmann has thus made Fitzgerald's text part of the movie by having Carraway narrate it and even writing the words on the screen as he says them.",8,0,1,23 April 2018
