Gremlins," Really good movie over all
",Truly this was a really good movie i loved the mild terror of the look of the gremlins and the cuteness of the mogwai so it was over all a really good movie i would recommend this for a 8 year old. the beginning is a little boring but the middle and the end get the hype up so it is really amazing,10,0,1,18 December 2017
