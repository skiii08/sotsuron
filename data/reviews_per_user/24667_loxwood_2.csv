The Blair Witch Project," Probably what would expect from a low budget production.
",Not at all frightening. The hype about it and also the effect that it had on some people that I know convinced me to see this film. i.e. A 19 year male frightened to go back to his house after dark and not wanting to go camping again!  Probably pulling all of our legs. Very disappointing as a genuine horror film. Maybe I have little or no imagination. The script would have been improved with a lot less 'F' words. Maybe they cut too much of the original length that they shot. All in all about 2 out of 10.,Null,0,1,20 August 1999
Notting Hill," Pretty unimpressed
","Did not look forward to this film and was not disappointed. Not a patch on 4 Weddings.  Really difficult to find much to laugh about. Grant's habit of saying 'Right' about 500 times was infuriating. Nobody, including the Welshman, had any good lines. Again lack of colour in the street scenes by leaving out the West Indian contingent was an error. Roberts did look younger and prettier but perhaps she benefited from lack of make up? All in all a film to quickly forget.",1,2,8,31 May 1999
