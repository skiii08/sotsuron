The Benchwarmers," three men that form a baseball team dedicated to kids who get bullied
","This was the best and funniest movie I have ever seen. It was absolutely hilarious! I think everyone should see it at least once. Be careful, you will laugh so hard that you may pee your pants. HaHa Clark, off of Napoleon Dynamite, has done it again. He made me laugh so hard! I thought it was one of the stupidest (but in a good way), funniest, dumbest movie ever. I will definitely buy this one when it comes to the stores. It was so funny that i quoted sayings from the movie all night long after wards. You will not be able to resist this movie. If i could rate it more that a ten it would get the highest number there is. You will absolutely love it. You have got to see it!",10,1,6,8 April 2006
