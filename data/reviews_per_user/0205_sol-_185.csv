The Lobster," Can rules and regulations ever be avoided?
","Set in an alternative reality in which unmarried individuals have 45 days to find a partner or be transformed into an animal, a jilted middle aged man flees to join some outlaws, only to find that they live by an equally rigid code. With such an offbeat premise, 'The Lobster' is always clearly a satire and the film cleverly mocks the way contemporary societies function. The unmarried individuals, for example, have to find a partner with a 'deficiency' in common (like the way dating services work), and they are subjected to spelled out lecturers in which the benefits of being in a relationship are driven home - to avoid rape, choking death when eating, etc. The film is incredibly funny at times too with Colin Farrell giving an excellent deadpan performance, pretending to be uncaring of a suicide at one point to seem as heartless as a prospective partner to-be. Rachel Weisz also has a superb turn late in the piece. With such an outlandish story though, the film unavoidably leaves open unanswered questions. Where does the child suddenly appear from? How can a society properly function where individuals cannot be separate from partners (what about those mall cops?). The film's take on the coupled society in which we live is sharp enough though for make any such issues a secondary concern. There does indeed something amiss with the way people tend to bounce almost immediately from relationship to another in the world in which we live, and certainly it is easy to imagine some of the rituals of our society seeming just as bizarre to the characters in the alternative reality of this film.",Null,4,9,10 December 2015
Vertigo," My brief review of the film
","A stylishly directed mystery film with an eye for colour, good cinematography and some excellent acting, the film is pretty much a triumph all around. The story is intriguing and the characters are all very human, making it easy to relate to them. James Stewart is perfect in the lead, and Kim Novak is absolutely stunning, but a special mention must also go to Barbara Bel Geddes too. Everything falls into place perfectly, and the film has a number of aspects that can be analysed deeper, with a lot of symbolism and a number of deep themes. And with outstanding technical aspects too, which include a good score and artistic art direction, it is pretty well a perfect film in itself.",Null,2,5,22 February 2005
10 Cloverfield Lane," Trust
","Knocked unconscious in an automobile accident, a young woman wakes up in an underground bunker and has to determine whether or not her male companions are telling the truth about a nuclear apocalypse above ground in this unsettling thriller starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Tension hangs well in the air throughout with John Goodman turning in a fine, deliberately ambiguous performances as the chief captor/rescuer who may or may not have lured another young woman down to the bunker before. The bunker itself is also a magnificent feat of art direction as it often looks more like a comfortable den than a traditional fallout shelter (there is a worthwhile brief documentary on the DVD about the bunker's meticulous construction). While the first hour and a quarter of the film is captivating stuff with eerie sound effects and sporadic power failures, the film runs at least twenty minutes too long with all ambiguity erased near the end. Well filmed as the final few scenes may well be, they lack the energy that the film manages to otherwise drum up from making us question what is really afoot. The concluding scene admittedly has quite a bit to say about the choices we make under stress, but the denouement here is nevertheless underwhelming for a film that, for the most part, preys upon insecurities among strangers and the difficulty of developing trust. Winstead is very good though, and with films like this and 'Faults', she is proving herself to be quite an actress. The majority of the movie also moves very well for a director making his big screen debut.",Null,1,1,10 July 2016
War Dogs," Dogs of War
","Two childhood friends discover that there is money to be made as illegal arms dealers, but an atmosphere of distrust, basic human greed and the dangers of the Middle East get in the way in this vibrant comedy from Todd Phillips. The film is based on the experiences of two actual amateur arms dealers and with voice-over narration plus the presence of Jonah Hill, it is unsurprising that the film has been compared to 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. What made the Scorsese film such a ride though was the narration by a very charismatic Leonardio DiCaprio. Here though it is Jonah Hill, not Miles Teller, who is the charismatic one, and it is hard not to feel that 'War Dogs' would have flowed better with the deeply flawed Hill rather than the moralistic Teller narrating the tale. Tension also peters out somewhat towards the midway point, but the introductory scenes are great and the final 40 minutes are excellent as the plot takes a 'Social Network'-like turn with memorable quips like 'you're just playing the part of my best friend'. This final section of the film is in fact so strong, with the friendship between the pair really tested with so much money on stake, that it almost makes up for all other shortcomings. This is an unquestionably bumpy ride, but excellent chapter headings help pace the material well and Teller certainly holds his own even if Hill dominates every scene he is in.",Null,0,0,5 June 2017
The Hangover," Hung Over
","Waking up in their Vegas hotel room with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the cupboard and no memory of the events of the night before, three men desperately try to piece together the events of the previous evening in order to locate a friend who has gone missing in this Golden Globe winning comedy. Given the importance of wild, drunken shenanigans to the plot, one might expect 'The Hangover' to be a juvenile comedy full of laughs of the gross-out variety, however, while there is some over-the-top vomiting and toilet humour, the vast majority of gags in the film are surprisingly well scripted. The screenplay is in fact quite clever and innovative with many mysteries beyond just the baby, tiger and missing friend - most of which only gradually begin to surface as the friends delve deeper and deeper into the events of the night before. The shot of the friends by the side of the road before the film begins to flash back is thoughtfully done too to disguise one of the main twists towards the end. Not all the gags work, with several telegraphed too far in advance (Bradley Cooper mentioning that only the interior of the car is damaged) and some of the characters are a little grating, but the film is more amusing than most R-rated movies out there. A photo montage during the end credits additionally provides a pitch perfect note for the film to conclude on.",Null,0,0,5 April 2017
Raiders of the Lost Ark," No Ordinary Archaeologist
","Hired to stop the Nazis getting hold of a priceless biblical artifact, a 1930s archaeologist has to combat swordsmen, sadistic Germans... and a pathological fear of snakes in this popular adventure film that brought the character of Indiana Jones to screens. The film begins strongly with a thrilling sequence in which Indy has to make his way through booby traps galore in a tomb, and while nothing later on quite matches this tension, there are several exciting moments to be had with a multi-tonal John Williams score perfectly complementing the action. This is hardly a deep or meaningful film, the antagonists range from one-note to one-dimensional and as a character, Indy lacks the charisma of an action hero like James Bond. The attempts to paint Indy as an ordinary university professor who just enjoys adventures never quite gels either since he is more agile and better at close combat than the very best of MI6. All that said and done, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a film full of memorable small moments and there are several excellent artistic shots throughout, most notably some diggers against an orange sunset and Harrison Ford viewed as only a shadow against a wall when first meeting Karen Allen. A supernatural twist near the end also takes the film in some unexpected directions and the iconic final shot of the film makes for a fantastic final note to end on.",Null,0,0,21 April 2017
United 93," Flight
","What exactly transpired on United Flight 93 -- the fourth hijacked aircraft that did not meet its target on September 11, 2001 -- is something we may never know, but using information from dozens of interviews, this speculative drama portrays what may have occurred. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, the film is a riveting experience with the deliberately unsteady camera-work and lack of big name stars making the film feel like a documentary at times. Whether it benefits from flipping back and forth between the title flight and the frantic ground crew is debatable; tension dissipates every time the film cuts away from the plane, but the exposition revealed in the cutaway scenes certainly adds to the sullen mood. The film's more hotly debated issue though is its choice to paint the terrorists as flawed, questioning and equally as scared and nervous as the passengers. It is a curiously objective move, and yet without any of the passengers or flight crew fleshed out in any depth, an odd dynamic develops as we get to know the terrorists better than their victims. The intense final 20 or so minutes of the film do need deep characterisation though as the passengers and surviving crew members band together in a surefire testament to the power of the human spirit. While the denouement is hard to watch here without a lump developing in the throat, there is something uplifting about the film as it showcases just how much a bunch of strangers can achieve together; history today would no doubt be different had they acted differently that day.",Null,0,0,11 February 2017
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," My brief review of the film
","With a surprisingly good dose of atmosphere, thanks to great lighting choices and moody sets, this film manages to capture typical childhood imagination and sense of adventure very well. The second half is weaker than the first, as it becomes a bit too sentimental as it progresses, but I personally still found it thoroughly engaging the whole time through. The music score is wonderful, as is the camera-work and special effects. The editing is a little less than great though, with awkward jump cuts here and there. The film is very simple, and it seems easy to flaw it for being so, however, since the film takes a child's point-of-view outlook on the events, the simple delivery is quite effective. The lack of complexity truly invokes a sense of being young and blissfully naïve again. The only aspect that could be labeled as too simple is the characters - they could have definitely done with more depth. Overall, this is a well-made escapism film: a well-crafted dive into a child's perspective. Its simplicity will annoy some, but others will find it charming. I guess it depends a lot on the individual viewer here.",Null,0,0,19 October 2005
Casablanca," My brief review of the film
","A wonderfully nostalgic piece of cinema, featuring one of the best ensemble casts put to screen, the film is well shot and smartly written, but not really perfect viewing as such. It is poignant and delightful to watch, but little seems possible to gain upon multiple viewings. The film's issues and themes are very much on the surface, and one is able to notice how poorly some of the characters are constructed when it is known already what is to happen on a second viewing. Still, this film is an extremely well made piece of cinema, and a highly influential one too, but call it absolutely 100% perfect seems a touch ill judged.",Null,0,2,8 March 2005
Lifeboat," Adrift with the Enemy
","Stranded on a lifeboat after their ship is torpedoed by a German U- boat, a group of survivors find themselves torn between what to do after rescuing one of the Germans who sank their ship in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. With lots of talk and a single location, 'Lifeboat' moves rather slow at first with some very obvious moral dilemmas; 'we're on our own; we can make our own laws,' one of them claims. Things become more twisted and intense in the second half though, beginning with a surprise revelation regarding the mysterious German, played perfectly by Walter Slezak. In fact, the entire second half of the film is rather riveting once the intriguing Slezak becomes a point of focus (none of the other characters are particularly remarkable) and the film ends on a strong note. The final scene is a little on the didactic side, but it is relatively brief and for a film with a clear anti-Nazi agenda, 'Lifeboat' offers a near balanced portrayal of the Germans at its best. The basic story (by John Steinback) has a refreshingly timeless quality to it too, with ideas in terms of trusting 'the enemy' and the uncertainty posed by wartime conditions coming across as fairly universal themes (see also George Seaton's 'The Hook' and 'The Long and the Short and the Tall'). Beneath the surface of Allied vs Axis tensions, there lies here a human tale here of trust, mistrust and desperation in adverse conditions.",Null,0,1,18 September 2016
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Brian's Song
","Mistaken for the messiah, a hapless a young man from Nazareth tries to avoid crucifixion in this controversial comedy that was banned in several countries upon initial release due to its religious irreverence. Written by the six members of the Monty Python troupe (who collectively play forty roles), the humour is hit-and-miss as per the troupe's norm. There is nothing especially funny about Terry Jones in drag, the lisping of Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate goes on for far too long and other parts are simply silly (mentally handicapped jailer). The jokes that do work are admittedly excellent though. A lesson on how to haggle is a particular highlight, same goes for a stoning scene in which all participants are actually women in disguise, plus the politics of the various rebel factions in Judea are great. The second half of the movie also works better than the buildup to it as the title character finds himself unable to rid himself of followers mistaking him for their saviour and no matter what he says, he cannot get them to change their view. The film is also topped off with the most memorable ending of all four Monty Python movies with its celebration of optimism in the face of adversity.",Null,1,2,18 November 2017
Citizen Kane," My brief review of the film
","An artistically directed film noir drama with arguably the best black and white photography of all time, Welles uses an extensive range of film techniques, and in particular the lighting used in the film is very impressive. Welles is also superb in the lead role, playing the title character from young adulthood to old age, with the assistance of some excellent makeup. However, as impressive as it is, none of the supporting characters are all that well drawn out or acted and the use of music in the film feels inappropriate and it detracts from certain scenes. In terms of film techniques it was groundbreaking in its time, and is still quite admirable even by standards today, but as an overall film it is just not quite as satisfying as what it could have been. Still, it certainly is interesting in terms of plot, with issues of love, fame and happiness amongst others in the film, and it certainly is a film great.",Null,2,5,16 January 2005
Inglourious Basterds," What shall the history books read?
","As Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel states at one point, 'what shall the history books read?' is an important theme of this Quentin Tarantino movie that subverts history to present an alternative look at how World War II might have shaped up with a few unwise choices from the Nazis. The plot has Hitler, Goebbels and other high ranking officials attending a propaganda film premiere together - something that gives two factions the same idea to blow up the Nazis. As per Tarantino norm, 'Inglourious Basterds' benefits from snappy dialogue and memorable characters, but this is very much an ensemble piece and sadly not all the characters are fascinating. Waltz is excellent with his cunning interrogations and Mélanie Laurent has some excellent moments as Jewish woman living under a pseudonym and operating the theatre where the propaganda film will be shown. None of the other characters are particularly remarkable though (same goes for the performances), especially Brad Pitt and the over-the-top Italian accent that he inflects at one point. Pitt does get some of the film's best lines though, including in the final memorable scene. Add in some superb spinning shots from Robert Richardson and this is a pretty good- looking film too, but whether it has much to offer beyond its novelty of twisting historical fact, as sometimes happens in the history books, is debatable.",Null,1,1,3 June 2017
Iron Man 2," Iron Sequel
","Threatened by a Russian weapons designer with a personal grudge, Tony Stark has to conquer alcohol abuse to defend his technology in this big budget sequel to the 2008 hit. The film boasts some great special effects and the first fight sequence between Stark and Mickey Rourke (as the Russian) on a crowded racetrack is simply divine. Add in a fun turn from Sam Rockwell and 'Iron Man 2' shows a lot of promise at first; unfortunately, it fails to capitalise on this. For a superhero movie, the action is oddly sparse and limited. There are few thrilling scenes near the end, but otherwise after the initial encounter with Rourke, all we get is a pointless drunken fight between close friends Downey and Don Cheadle in the way of action -- something hardly that exciting since neither friend feels in mortal danger. The furthering of Stark's character arc is half-baked too. While the Part One offered an intelligent glimpse at naive weapons designer turned selfless philanthropist, here Stark is battling his ego, and it is only mildly interesting to watch him grow humble as opposed to completely change his outlook on life as in Part One. The film is not worthless though. The banter between Downey and Cheadle is excellent, especially towards the end, and Rourke's character is awesome. The film also has a few thoughtful things to offer in terms of how exposed vulnerabilities can be more damaging than death.",Null,0,0,2 June 2017
Seven Years in Tibet," Seven Year Itch
","Thrown into a prisoner-of-war camp at the outbreak of World War II, an Austrian mountain climber escapes and eventually finds a new purpose in life as a mentor to the Dalai Lama in this historical drama based on actual events. Brad Pitt has some excellent, quiet moments as the conflicted main character who gradually progresses from arrogant and resentful to humble and compassionate, however, his attempt at an Austrain accent makes it a hard performance to sit through whenever he opens his mouth. There is, however, a lot to like about Pitt's character and the way he comes to see the Dalai Lama (still a boy upon meeting him) as a surrogate son. The friendship and camaraderie between the pair is very sweet and easily the highlight of the film with the Dalai Lama's intelligent questions and Pitt's thoughtful responses. The two do not meet until around halfway in though, and amusing as David Thewlis often is as a fellow POW who escapes with Pitt, the first half the film does not quite have the zest of the second half. This is a technically well accomplished movie either way though with the atmospheric Golden Globe nominated music of John Williams and all the majestic, vast natural landscapes rendering the tale quite immersive. It is hard not to wonder what may have been though with a more compact run-time - and no fake accent.",Null,0,0,28 September 2017
Zootopia," Road to Zootopia
","Set in an alternate universe without humans in which all mammals live harmoniously in cities, the world's first rabbit police officer forms an uneasy alliance with a fox to solve a mystery in this Disney animated feature film. The movie does a surprisingly good job mixing and a balancing various genres: it is part comedy, part adventure, part mystery, part fantasy, and in amongst all that it has some nifty messages to offer with the species prejudices on display coming quite close to racism in human society today. None of this is particularly subtle with the dialogue frequently spelling out the film's racial agenda, but it is thought-provoking nonetheless and the way the rabbit objects to be called cute even offers a poke at workplace sexism. Solid as the film's messages may be, the film's best achievement is how genuinely funny it is, full of audience-winking quips ('life isn't some cartoon') and eccentric supporting characters, especially a yak voiced by Tommy Chong. The rabbit's neighbours (only heard; never seen) have some particularly amusing things to say; 'it might be worse!' comments one of them through the wall after hearing our heroine philosophise about tomorrow like Scarlett O'Hara. And on the subject of movie references, the film features one of the best 'Godfather' spoofs of recent years too. Not all the jokes hit home (especially the final one before the end credits) and the resolution and ending feel a little rushed, but generally speaking, 'Zootopia' is entertaining from start to finish with the deeper things it has to say being merely icing on the cake.",Null,2,4,22 January 2017
Green Room," Seeing Green
","Coming across a corpse backstage at their latest venue, a punk rock band are a locked in a small room by the white supremacists who own the venue in this independent thriller from 'Blue Ruin' director Jeremy Saulnier. As per 'Blue Ruin', this is a fairly good-looking film with bursts of memorably graphic (and yet never gratuitous) violence, however, the protagonists here are nowhere near as three dimensional as the main character in 'Blue Ruin' and it is sometimes hard to feel for their plight, especially as it was their choice to accept the Neo Nazi gig in the first place. Of course, this might be a deliberate theme: delve into the world of white supremacists and you are playing with fire, etc. The film gets most of its power though from the basic premise of being trapped deep inside a place and having to force one's way out, which becomes even more critical since the band (rather conveniently) play off the grid and have told no one about their latest gig, meaning that it is just up to the Neo Nazis to work out how to dispose of their corpses in non-suspicious ways. With Patrick Stewart well cast as the eerily soft-talking owner of the establishment, the film certainly scores some creepy segments and there is nary a boring moment to be had. Those expecting something as intense and emotionally devastating as 'Blue Ruin' may, however, be disappointed.",Null,0,3,28 May 2017
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," War Over Words
","True to its title, this big screen version of the popular animated TV series features more violence, profanity and obscenities than any prior episodes of the show. The film is not, however, offensive simply for the sake of it; the plot is full of satirical bite as the story focuses on four boys watching a controversial motion picture (not unlike the one that they are in!) and the over-the-top reactions of the local community when they start repeating obscene phrases that they heard. Intelligent debate is brought up in terms of whether offensive language or graphic violence is more dangerous and there is something pointed in how everything culminates in war simply over words. The relative innocence of the boys is notable too; as they say in song, 'the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say'; they are only curious about the adult world and are not interested in offending anyone. Cartman aside, the boys do not repeat any of the obscenities from the film-within in hate. Interesting as all this might sound, the movie runs out of steam well before the credits roll and the carnage towards the end comes across as a rather mindless. The series consists of half-hour episodes after all, and running at nearly three times that length, it is perhaps only inevitable that the material does not stretch out that well. There have also been several better satirical episodes released in the years since this feature length treatment came out, but full of bright songs and quirky characters, 'Bigger Longer & Uncut' does quite well for what it is.",Null,0,1,20 March 2016
The Danish Girl," Great Danes
","Inspired by a 1920s Danish artist with gender dysphoria who became one of the first to ever opt for surgical gender realignment, this Tom Hooper drama offers an intriguing insight into a fairly recent time when such terms were unheard of. The central character's dilemma is, as a result, twice as interesting as he not only has to wrestle with his own identity but a lack of support and understanding. Promising as this might sound, and relatively convincing as lead actor Eddie Redmayne is in drag, his character is always self-absorbed with a near total disregard for his wife's feelings that renders him hard to relate to. Alicia Vikander fares better as the neglected wife in the equation with a more dynamic character arc as she gradually learns to accept that she needs to 'lose' her husband for him to be happy; looks convey more than words in a memorable moment as she is told 'he won't be your husband' after surgery. In fact, a more enticing film could have been spun from concentrating more on her. Something also feels amiss in how Vikander dressing Remayne as a woman (for a pose) is the event that triggers everything. We are later given a couple of anecdotes about him having similar feelings in the past, but it mostly feels that dressing up started it all - not deep-rooted inner doubts. Of course, there is a limit to how much can be fitted into a two hour feature, and with sterling cinematography and great music, plus accurate costumes and sets, 'The Danish Girl' does a decent job, even if it sometimes feels like it is only skimming the surface here.",Null,0,1,24 February 2017
Elizabeth," The Queen
","Loosely based on the life of Queen Elizabeth I, this historical drama examines her ascent to throne following the death of her sister and the hardships she faced as an illegitimate woman wanting to make her own decisions. The film is slow to warm up with a lot of time spent on Elizabeth frolicking about as a youth before taking the crown. The second half of the film flows better with a constant sense of imminent danger and unease. Much of Cate Blanchett's transformation in the title role also comes in the second half as she goes from nervously practicing a speech again and again to confidently telling all her advisors what to do. Highly praised as Blanchett's performance often it is, it is the cinematography that stands out the most here. 'Match Point' cinematographer Remi Adefarasin does a magnificent job shooting the film with spinning shots from extreme high and extreme low angles and lots of gliding shots throughout. The film's next best asset is the performances of Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush and Fanny Ardant, but not everyone is well cast. Joseph Fiennes is only adequate as Elizabeth's controversial love interest while Vincent Cassel plays his role as a cross-dressing suitor with such an inappropriately comic edge that he feels like part of an entirely different film. The casting is generally good though, and the costumes and sets are as detailed as one would expect. This might not be the most accurate or enticing screen depiction of Elizabeth I, but for its insight into the fragile mentality of the monarch during the first few years of her reign, it is a hard film to pass up.",Null,1,1,3 April 2016
Ice Age: The Meltdown," My brief review of the film
","It is amazing how advanced animation has become. Not only are the animated sets in this film impressive, so are the facial expressions that the characters are able to have. The eyes of the animals tell a lot about them in the film, conveying their emotions in the same way that a human actor would in a live action film. So, the animation is superb in this sequel to 'Ice Age', however it unfortunately falls into the same trap of the first film - having a formulaic story and children's level jokes next to the visual delights. That said, it is generally funnier than the first film, but the story is noticeably thinner, and it is mostly worth watching only for the visual marvels and Scrat. The intercut sequences with Scrat are what works best in the film - he has the most interesting personality of all the characters. I would love to see a feature length film with just him in it.",Null,2,2,19 April 2006
Billy Elliot," Dancer in the Light
","Passionate about dance, a teenage boy secretly attends ballet classes and has deal with his father discovering his secret in this British drama starring Jamie Bell. The film may only have the most obvious of messages to offer in terms of the virtues of individualism and the hurtfulness of gender stereotypes, but it still leaves quite an impact with Bell in strong form. Bell has his own prejudices that he learns to deal with, fighting his own preconceptions that all other boys who do ballet are 'bent' and Bell gives us a multi-dimensional character with a love for dance that resonates but also much internal anger. Julie Walters is equally as impressive as his spunky ballet teacher and they really carry the film. The less said about Bell's father, the better though. His father changes so quickly from being against ballet to in favour of it that the progression never rings true. The film has some crafty moments though in which the father's difficulties with work and participation in demonstrations are edited against Bell dancing. More could have probably been made of Bell emerging from such working class origins, but the film has plenty to like as it is with its celebration of dance as something that boys and girls can both succeed at.",Null,0,0,3 December 2017

The exploration into ocean life is perfectly animated, however most amazing is the realism with which Sydney is portrayed. The visual style is not alone what makes this great however, it is as the film's delightful characters and sense of humour that make it enjoyable. All the characters are funny, each in their own way; the film reaches hilarity many times; and the whole production buzzes along well to the brilliant choral music of Thomas Newman. The sound in terms of the sea and seaside noises is excellently recorded and edited too. This is not only perfect family entertainment, but also a perfect film overall.",Null,1,3,17 February 2005
That Thing You Do!," Different Sort of Fab Four
","Inspired by the success of The Beatles, a group of friends try to make it big on the music scene in the mid-1960s in this film written and directed by Tom Hanks. The Academy Award nominated title song is very catchy (and probably should have won the Oscar over 'Evita') and some of the band's other tunes are decent, yet the biggest sell-point here is all the parallels to The Beatles, including a similar involvement in the motion picture industry; the film is very cleverly done in this regard. There are less hurdles than one might expect though as the band rise upwards. Their first manager (who meets them in a rundown van) seems a little fishy, but turns out to have a heart of gold, and same goes twice over for their second manager, played by Hanks himself, who lectures them about treating their girlfriends right and so forth. In short, everyone is a little too pure at heart for the film to have any real edge; there is no producer trying to sell them short as in 'The Harder They Come' and all the messages about not letting fame get to their heads are fairly simplistic. Still, there is much to enjoy in the music and genuine 1960s ambiance that Hanks manages to recreate as writer-director, plus a running gag involving their misspelled band name is funny each time. This is an undeniably pleasant look at the music industry of yesteryear even if it lack a bit as a drama.",Null,0,0,5 August 2017
Hot Fuzz," Shaun of the Cops
","Posted to an idyllic small town whose denizens believe that their low crime rate is due to being lax when enforcing the law, a workaholic city cop discovers something sinister afoot in this police spoof from the makers of 'Shaun of the Dead'. The film has received some flack from those insistent on comparing the two films, and 'Hot Fuzz' does pale in comparison without the urgency or sense of real danger that made the earlier film so dynamite - but it is still a solid comedy with great flashy editing. The film derives a surprising amount of humour from Nick Frost copying things that lead actor Simon Pegg has earlier said but mixing up the words, and zany touches that initially just seem odd (the swan) lead to some big laughs later on. The film also gives Timothy Dalton his best role since leaving the James Bond franchise as a condescending local business owner with something up his sleeve. What really sets 'Hot Fuzz' apart though from the myriad of other spoofs out there is the darkly comical turn it takes in its final third with a grisly solution to a series of local murders Pegg that starts investigating (hilariously, the villagers keep insisting that they are accidents even when foul play is obvious). Adding a little extra depth, the filmmakers also throw the workaholic nature of Pegg's character on the table, questioning what he may be missing out on by dedicating his life to his job. The film never plucks too deeply into the character, but there is ample characterisation for one to be able to appreciate the film as a study of man examining his job dedication in addition to a laugh-fest.",Null,0,0,29 December 2015
Spotlight," Shine a Light
","Based on the true story of how reporters at the Boston Globe shone a light on a culture of covering up child abuse in the Catholic Church, 'Spotlight' tells an interesting slice of modern history. It is remarkably riveting given that the outcome is well known as the film places us in the shoes of the reporters, unaware of just how a big a story they have. The film shows the emotional toll that the investigation has on the reporters; one wrestles with whether to tell his neighbours after discovering a possible predator priest living in his neighbourhood. Mark Ruffalo has the flashiest performance as the angriest reporter on the team, and the film gets some good thrills out of his struggles against bureaucracy to obtain incriminating public documents, yet Michael Keaton delivers the film's finest performance. As a born and bred Boston citizen, he finds himself internally divided and has some excellent moments near the end as he reveals a shocking twist about himself. The choice to focus on the reporters to almost the exclusion of the victims renders the film an odd experience though; the reporters seem more disgusted by the corruption of the Church than the actions of their priests and the psychological impact of child abuse. Never to mind, the characters are interesting enough that the film works as a tale of the power of a few motivated individuals to take on an institution and make a difference. Director Tom McCarthy uses gradual zooms in and out in all the office scenes to smartly prevent the film from feeling static and Howard Shore places the icing on the cake with yet another powerful score.",Null,0,0,30 January 2016
Terminator Salvation," Salvage
","Set in 2018, this fourth film in the 'Terminator' franchise takes place entirely in the post-apocalyptic future as only ever talked about in the previous three installments. The plot has John Connor trying to finally find Kyle Reese (who he is yet to ever meet), while Reese tries to survive on his own, helped out in part by a mysterious stranger, played by Sam Worthington. While the secret behind Worthington's identity is always obvious from the get-go, the film successfully plays on ambiguities as to where his loyalties lie. He also gets some great personality crisis scenes late in the piece. With such a unique and original plot, 'Terminator Salvation' gets full points for not just imitating its predecessors, but through neglecting the formula of the original films, the results are less immersive overall. The film sorely lacks the chase thriller plotting of the earlier movies where everything is about surviving a nonstop killing machine who nobody else believes is really from the future. There are several lulls in the action and without an actor as charismatic as Arnold Schwarzenegger in a key role, the non-action scenes simply lack oomph. The whole muted colour scheme also comes off as a heavyhanded way of showing that the future is miserable, though the heart symbolism at the end takes the cake for lack of subtlety. If not a definite success, 'Salvation' is at least daring different at all times. It is also admittedly interesting to see the war against the machines in action; it is more a case that the war on its own is problematic when it comes to sustaining a feature length film.",Null,0,1,17 July 2016
L.A. Confidential," My brief review of the film
","Overall, there is no doubt that this is a good film, and the final half hour is very thrilling, with an excellent conclusion. It unfortunately takes quite a while to reach this point, and in the meantime the film fails to do anything particularly special. On the positive side, it is intriguing, with a complex web of events, the editing gives the film an appropriately exciting style, and the sound recording, whether it be office noises or gunshots, is always on the mark. A couple of things that the film failed to do for me were setting up a feel for the 1950s (the film looks too modern, and there are few indicators of the time period) and maintaining dramatic tension. James Cromwell looks so goofy in his role, and some parts of the film towards the beginning seemed to indicate comedy, in particular with Danny DeVito's character. Guy Pearce is the best of the cast, though perhaps the only one who pulls off a great performance. Kim Basinger won an Oscar, but perhaps for the film's reputation more than anything else. Other than looking a lot like Veronica Lake, there is little else to her role. The violence in the film does not work either. It is too graphic for it to be any dedication to noir, and it is so over-the-top at times that it is as goofy James Cromwell's character is. Perhaps the big problem though is working at what it is trying to say as a film. It is a study of the police force: corruption and working one's way to the top, but these ideas are only really fleshed out towards the end. The film's insight into detective work is good nevertheless, and at the least the film is able to end solidly. So yes, it is a good film with a great conclusion, but the path to getting there could have been improved upon perhaps. I have not read the novel, so maybe that is another thing? Some say that it is a rather good adaptation. Either way, the film is worth a go.",Null,1,2,14 December 2005
Concussion," Concussed
","Based on the true story of how a Nigerian-born pathologist persisted in exposing the long term health dangers of head injuries in football, 'Concussion' tells a fascinating slice of recent history. The negative effects of multiple concussions were apparently known to the NFL for years, but covered up by those promoting the sport, and the movie succeeds best when exploring this conspiracy and the difficulty of tackling a large organisation with high-up connections. The film is, however, only partially about this with at least half the screen time dedicated to the pathologist's personal life, which is nowhere near as engaging. There is something acute in how our protagonist, played by Will Smith, gradually learns to integrate into society at the same time so many NFL players start to slip out, but the filmmakers never make much of this irony and Smith learning to dance at a night club or gradually romancing a Kenyan woman forced into his company simply does not make for good viewing. Smith plays quite a conceited and arrogant character too, boasting about his many achievements from the very first scene and second-guessing the prejudices of others (accusing others of regarding him as a 'voodoo doctor'). Accent aside, Smith is not very remarkable either for all the controversy over his failure to secure an Oscar nomination. David Morse is, however, very, very good as the first NFL player in the film to lose his mind and Matthew Willig is excellent too. Whatever the case, the film certainly ends on a strong note with an absolutely haunting final shot.",Null,1,3,21 February 2016
Youth," Vacation
","Vacationing in this Swiss Alps with a film director friend, a retired music composer starts to reevaluate his life when asked by a messenger from the Queen of England to orchestrate one of his iconic works once more in this somewhat ironically titled film. Full of dreamy cutaways to the naked bodies of those staying at the same resort, as well as some near surreal nighttime shots, 'Youth' is a stylish film through and through and bits and pieces of the dialogue are pretty good, with an inspiration versus fermentation exchange standing out most. The story at hand is, however, far from encapsulating with the lethargic pacing eliminating any sense of urgency, and then there is the fact that Harvey Keitel's ageing filmmaker character is actually more interesting that Michael Caine's composer, though Paul Dano surprisingly enough trumps them both with a heartfelt turn as a film actor depressed over the fact that has been stereotyped ever since playing a single role in a film that he considers mediocre at best. He has two of the film's best scenes as he unsettles everyone by dressing as Hitler for breakfast one day and as he encounters a young girl who has actually seen one of his lesser known performances. Caine certainly has his own strong scenes (conducting a chorus of cows) but hardly that high an amount for a protagonist. With strong supporting turns from the likes of Rachel Weisz and Paloma Faith, amusingly playing herself, this is a hard film not to recommend, but it is certainly an example of movie that sounds much better on paper.",Null,0,1,18 February 2017
Silent Hill," Hill Has Eyes
","Intrigued by a ghost town that her daughter keeps mentioning in her sleep, a concerned mother drives there and finds herself contending with monsters that may or may not be real when her daughter goes missing in this moody horror film. 'Silent Hill' is atmospheric right from the get-go and much of its nightmarish imagery leaves an indelible impression, but adapted from a popular video game, the film never quite gels as a cohesive narrative. While evidently desperate to stop her daughter sleepwalking, Radha Mitchell's protagonist is rather hard to relate to; her decision to break down fences to take her daughter to a town full of toxic fumes never once seems rational, and it is all her own fault that her daughter gets lost. There are some creepy moments to be had as she goes in and out of abandoned, dilapidated buildings for quite a while, but it is not until around 90 minutes in that the film bothers to try to explain any of the bizarre happenings, and when it does, it comes in the form of a monologue that goes on for minutes on end. In short, the mythology of the movie is too complex for its own good. The special effects ridden scenes in the final quarter of the movie also pale against the suggestiveness of the initial shots of the town. 'Silent Hill' has at least a couple of good scares and the music and set design are first-rate, but as a narrative, it comes up a little short.",Null,0,0,21 April 2017
Hotel Rwanda," Grand Hotel
","Based on the true story of a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand refugees during the 1994 genocide, 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a glimpse at a sad chapter of modern history seldom told. Often mentioned is the blind eye turned by the outside world to what is happening in Rwanda with a key piece of dialogue coming from lead actor Don Cheadle saying that they need to shame the world into helping out. The film is supported by strong performances from not only Cheadle but also Sophie Okonedo as his strong-willed wife who truly rises above stereotype: she is never once fragile, passive or helpless. Upon initial release, the film attained comparisons to 'Schindler's List' with a similar story of a brave man sheltering others in war, however, such comparisons actually reveal some of 'Hotel Rwanda''s shortfalls. Most notably, Cheadle's Paul is honorable and generous from the get-go compared to Oskar Schindler's who gradually progresses from greedy to selfless. Spielberg's inclusion of seemingly random subplots (like the gun that does not go off) also paint a fuller picture of the Holocaust, whereas 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a far more contained portrait of the genocide. And yet, if not the out-and-out masterpiece that some claim it to be, 'Hotel Rwanda' remains quite an accomplished motion picture with tension frequently felt in the air.",Null,1,1,16 June 2017
The Hateful Eight," Cabin Fever
","Blizzard weather conditions lead to eight strangers sharing the warmth of an outskirts cabin, including a bounty hunter suspicious that someone is planning to free his prisoner in this mystery thriller from Quentin Tarantino. It is highly atmospheric stuff thanks a mix of moody music from Ennio Morricone and mobile cinematography from Robert Richardson with shots that slow creep up and down the characters. The film is divided into six chapters. The first three vary in excitement as they merely set up the tension and animosity in the air; the final three chapters though are powerhouse stuff with unexpected bursts of graphic violence, an intriguing murder mystery and the shadiness of everyone's background story (are any of them telling the whole truth?). This is, however, also one of those movies where it is nearly impossible to find a single character to care about or like, due in part to how little insight we get into anyone's actual background. And yet, this is perhaps the very purpose of 'The Hateful Eight': to create an emotional distance between the viewer and the flawed characters in order that we are forced to witness the power of hate, greed and revenge tear the characters apart without necessarily rooting for anyone to succeed. However one cuts it, this is a surefire interesting experience as long as one stays patient during the slower-moving first three chapters.",Null,0,1,9 May 2017
Ocean's Twelve," My brief review of the film
","While there are enough reasons for one to have reservations about calling this a great film, I must admit that I still found it quite decent entertainment. Soderbergh keeps it well paced and entertaining on a visual level, even with some overly shaky photography and awkward freeze frames, plus there is a great plot twist involving Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis later in the film. The best aspect of this crime caper though is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who adds a lot of sparks and a fresh streak to the material. Yes, the film has its downfalls, such as the plot, which is mostly a series of incidents that only work because one does not know what will happen next, and such as Andy Garcia's cardboard acting. The film lacks much depth and does not execute the buddy-buddy aspect as well as the first film did; however it is kind of fun in its own way: mindless amusement with some great visuals, a twisted plot, and credible acting by Zeta-Jones. No, it is not as good as one would expect with Soderbergh at the helm, but neither is it all that bad.",Null,2,4,12 March 2006
MASH," My extended review of the film
","They say that if you are a fan of the TV series you will not like 'MASH' the film. I would not call myself a real M*A*S*H fan. Sure, I have watched a few episodes, but I don't really follow it. Nevertheless I have seen enough to know that it is miles superior to Robert Altman's 1970 film, in terms of acting, characters and especially in terms of jokes.'MASH' was a highly popular film when it was released. Many saw it as the perfect epitome of rebellion against authority and anti-war sentiments. It even received Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director. Nowadays it feels out-of-date and old-fashioned, and not even all that much fun. I have heard it compared to 'Animal House' for its humour and anti-authority attitudes, but what made 'Animal House' better than the average such film was the well developed and appealing characters, of which 'MASH' the film (certainly not the TV series) has next to none.But with the TV series being a later spin-off from the movie, it is not quite right to compare and criticise. But the contrast is stark. However the film gets compliments for providing the excellent song score that would be used in the TV series. Here it has lyrics, and the song is memorable and rather well composed  its purpose however is not. The song is entitled 'Suicide is Painless' and is sung to a MASH worker who wants to commit suicide. Some have taken offence to the song as its proposal as the suicidal in the film wants to die for being homosexual. There is a further reason for this, so the offensiveness is not 100% justified, but the song still feels in bad taste.So what else is wrong with the film? It is episodic but disjointedly so. The small number of adventures of the characters do not fit in well together or flow well. There are also a number of irrelevant sequences that show rebellion against the system or the exploits of the MASH workers but nothing else. And the final main scene goes on for too long without much happening. One of the biggest problems however is that the characters talk over each other constantly. Not to mention, the jokes are dead awful.What can I say? I strongly disliked this film and I feel that it is one of the weakest Best Picture Academy Award nominees that I have seen. Had it been adapted from the TV series and not the other way around it would be inexcusable.",Null,11,22,8 January 2005
Final Destination 2," More Foresight
","Another premonition about a freak accident leads to a different group of 'death cheating' survivors fearing for their lives in this surprisingly decent sequel. While the crash/collision scenes are magnificently intense and very realistic, 'Final Destination 2' does not get off to the strongest start and the first half of the movie feels like more of a remake or rehash of the original, except with even more inventive and elaborate deaths. As the film progresses though, there are some chilling 'outward ripple' connections made to the characters from the first movie, which makes the overall project more interesting as an extrapolation on the events of Part One. And yet, even if one does walk away feeling that this is more of a rehash than a sequel, there are several improvements here. The death scenes, for instance, always leaving one guessing as to just what will deliver the fatal blow, the characters are more varied and have more personality than in the first film, plus there is quite a bit of comic relief that actually works. The sequel does not, however, have the visual panache that James Wong brought to the first film and nothing compares to Devon Sawa's hyper-awareness scenes in Part One. The basic idea is also not quite so fresh while delivering the same unanswered questions. As alluded to though, this is still a more worthwhile film overall than one might expect.",Null,0,0,6 October 2017
Horrible Bosses," Strangers from a Train
","Three friends disgruntled with their bosses conspire to swap murders a la 'Strangers on a Train' in this lively comedy. The film requires some suspension of disbelief as well as few convenient coincidences to click, however, it is an enjoyable enough romp since all concerned are clearly having a lot of fun playing their parts. In fact, if anything, the film is funnier the second time round knowing some of the hilarious set-ups to come. Kevin Spacey sizzles as a condescending boss, Jamie Foxx is great as their 'coach', and Colin Farrell has some truly wacky scenes as the slackest boss in the film - though his best moments come in the blooper reel played during the end credits. Donald Sutherland on the other hand is sadly under-used and Jennifer Aniston is never credible, but most of the performances work. The chemistry between the friends feels real too, and the script smartly gives the trio all of the funniest scenes rather than letting the bigger name boss actors steal the best parts. It also wonderful to see the film so happy to acknowledge its influences and origins with not only 'Strangers on a Train', but 'Throw Momma from a Train' also mentioned. If slow to warm up, this is possibly the funniest treatment that a swapping murders story has ever gotten, though one wonders what Hitchcock would make of it if he knew that his legacy had borne comedies full of crude jokes like this like this.",Null,1,2,17 January 2017
Malcolm X," Becoming a revered public figure
","Right from the opening credits in which an American flag slowly burns to form a letter 'X', this biography of the title human rights activist from Spike Lee is riveting viewing throughout. The film's strongest asset is Denzel Washington's lead performance; he undergoes several character progressions throughout as the film documents his whole transformation from convicted criminal to angry protester to revered public figure. The film benefits from some magnificent editing too with well-melded, dreamlike childhood flashbacks, a clever cutaway in which Washington imagines throw a cake in a condescending young man's face and some very deliberate cutting in a scene in which he looks up the definitions of 'black' and 'white' in the dictionary (probably the most potent part of the entire movie). The Oscar nominated costumes (zoot suits in particular) are great too. What does not quite work so well though is Lee's choice to unabashedly celebrate the title character. The sentimental epilogue seems ill-judged. Also, given how callous Malcolm is shown at times (coldly telling a sympathetic young white woman that she cannot do anything to help his cause) and how close-minded he is on certain issues, he always seems like more a deeply flawed man with his heart in the right place than a leader worthy of Lee's celebratory treatment. Never to mind, the film is engaging the whole way through, regardless of how one views the title character, with nary a boring moment to be had - which is a quite remarkable achievement for a that film clocks in at over three hours in length.",Null,2,5,21 February 2016
Black Mass," Mind of a Criminal
","Based on the true story of Boston crime lord Whitey Bulger and his longtime not-so-legitimate association with the FBI, 'Black Mass' tells a notable slice of American history. The film is credited as a biography on IMDb, which is not quite right; Johnny Depp is electric as Bulger, but he is more of a supporting character in the tale with emphasis constantly on Joel Edgerton as his FBI contact - a childhood friend who finds himself in a tricky position, torn between loyalty to the Bureau and his a lifetime pal who has looked after him for as long as he can remember. It all seems fine at first, with Edgerton able to offer Depp immunity if he agrees to turn informant, however, as Depp misuses his immunity to take down those around him and become even more ruthless, Edgerton finds himself stuck in a corner. On one hand, all the emphasis on Edgerton does not feel right. With limited room for characterisation, Depp's Bulger is defined in very broad brushstrokes; we are led to believe that his anger over his son's death hardened him as a criminal, but we seldom see how he ticks beneath the tough surface. On the other hand, Edgerton is so great wrestling with his internal conflicts that more emphasis on him may have in fact been better. Either way, the film is quite uneven with all the jumping between characters, but solid acting keeps thing afloat. While Edgerton steals the show, Depp has several excellent moments; his anger over a 'family secret' recipe is a surefire highlight, and the scenes where he bonds with his son shed a lot of light on the way his mind works.",Null,0,1,24 September 2016
The Best Years of Our Lives," Coming Home
","Readjusting to civilian life proves challenging for three World War II veterans in this sombre drama from William Wyler. Clocking in at close to three hours, the film has received some criticism about its length, but the ample runtime allows the film to properly flesh out all three protagonists and the camaraderie that develops between them as they meet while sharing a flight back to the same hometown. Fredric March won an Oscar for his portrayal of a banker unable to instantly return to being the shrewd businessman that his colleagues expect of him. Dana Andrews was not Oscar nominated but is equally as effective as a pilot haunted by nightmares of war and vexed by a selfish wife who believes that he could just 'snap out of it' if he really wanted to. The best performance comes from Harold Russell though, a nonprofessional actor who really did lose his hands during the war. There is a truly heartfelt moment when he smashes a glass window and the film handles his uncertainty over whether his fiancÃ©e really still loves him very well. At times, the movie edges into melodramatic territory with Hugo Friedhofer's overbearing score no help, but it flows pretty smoothly in general. There also is a lot to like about how Wyler sets the film entirely in the aftermath of the war and yet manages to convey just how much each man is changed by his experiences.",Null,1,1,17 November 2017
Taxi Driver," My extended review of the film
","'Taxi Driver' has deservedly earned a reputation as one of the best films of 1976. It has however also often been called one of the best films of all time. Whilst it is a brilliant piece of cinema, with a superb lead performance and some excellent camera-work, it is nevertheless hard for me to agree with the claim of it as an all-time great.To start with the good things, 'Taxi Driver' is excellently directed. The whole atmosphere of the streets of New York is captured very well, both in the daytime and at night. The film has a great visual style, giving the streets a dreamlike quality, and it all feels very realistic, or at least up until the final 15 minutes. The cinematography captures De Niro's journey perfectly, with zooms, steady-cam and panning all carefully distributed and edited into the film.It is a character study of a man alone and it definitely digs deep into the protagonist. We are given an insight into his loneliness and are subjected to his social ineptitude. Some of his actions still seem a tad unrealistic, like with the movie date he goes on, but in general, Travis Bickle is quite a well written character, and De Niro plays him sensationally. Every single movement on his face is carefully observed, and it left me wondering all the time whether or not he is insane.However, this is a point when some of the quirks I have with the film occur. For a character study we get to know relatively little about Travis' background. He served in the marines and now he is a taxi driver. At one stage of the film he listens to a speech about Vietnam vets fighting for better treatment. Does this mean that Travis served in Vietnam, and did Vietnam drive him insane? We never really get to know. This is not necessarily a bad thing as such, as it adds to his mysteriousness, and the film still survives, but it did at least have me groping for a bit more.Also while discussing De Niro's high quality performance, what pops into mind is how the other performers in the film were. And that is a bit of problem in my books. Foster received a lot of critical attention at the time of the film's release for playing a prostitute so young. Yet, looking at her in retrospect she hardly does anything with her character. Or what there is of her character, and there is not all too much there, other than that she is younger than the average prostitute, and like the average prostitute, she is sort of unhappy with her work, but yet manages to get by okay. In fact, none of the characters other than Travis' are well developed or well acted. Sure, they aren't poorly written and performed, but 'Taxi Driver' does have to survive on just one good performance and one good character. And actually, considering that, the film gets by quite well.But all that said, Martin Scorsese has a memorable cameo role as a taxi passenger who might just be slightly madder than Travis. Interestingly, from what I've read, Scorsese only took the part because the actor assigned to play the character did not show up on the day of shooting, and despite that Scorsese actually gives off the second best performance in the film, right after De Niro's.A couple of other points worth noting on the negative side are the meandering nature of the film and the music. Neither of these aspects subtracts much from the film, but they do add to the charge that it is not quite a perfect film. The picture wanders around quite a bit to show the nature of De Niro's mind, but this does make it a tad tiresome to follow about. As for the music used in the film, Bernard Herrmann's score is highly memorable and great to listen to, but it is more so dinner music rather than a fitting score for such a realistically grim film.In spite of the problems that I have with the film that I have already mentioned, it is a very solid watch until the final 15 minutes. The film is all rather well put together, and if were not for the film's reputation of perfection, the points I've mentioned would be hardly worth going into detail about. But, the final 15 minutes of the film do seal it as something that I would be cautious to call perfect.The ending is not weak, but compared to the rest of the film the final few scenes are highly unrealistic. The violence and brutality is the type that you would expect in a cartoon, and what happens to Travis in the end is so unrealistic that some have their own interpretations about a sense of reality. But it is hard to discuss this without revealing details that may ruin one's first viewing of the film.At this point in time, I have only seen 8 films from Martin Scorsese, and 'Taxi Driver' is one of only four that I've seen twice. However, I would still be inclined to call it Scorsese's best film. It pretty well made all round, even if not pretty to watch, and perhaps it is one of the best films of the 1970s. There is however enough in it for me to have my reservations about saying how great it is.",Null,1,2,6 May 2005
Over the Top," Deceptive title and poster
","Cast as a truck driver and professional arm wrestler who bonds with his estranged son while the boy's mother is in hospital, Sylvester Stallone gives a touching performance in this deceptively titled film. The promotional posters are equally misleading, hinting at an all-out 'First Blood' style action film, whereas 'Over the Top' is actually about two relatives learning to connect while on the road despite very different attitudes and views on life. David Mendenhall is great as Stallone's eloquent, precocious son, who after years in military school, has come to always say 'sir' and value nutritious food over the unhealthier snacks that boys his age tend to like. One of the best elements of the film is how Stallone, despite being a failure in his son's eyes, manages to teach him to enjoy life while his son also gives Stallone an extra boost in his depressing existence. The narrative nevertheless has striking gaps, particularly concerning why Stallone walked out in the first place and why his wife now trusts him with their son. The final half-hour of the movie is also far weaker than the first hour with everything focused on a wrestling championship, bizarrely edited to include documentary-style interviews. And then there is the ending, which is rushed and too neatly packaged, never resolving the grandfather's hostility. Never to mind, the strength of the first hour makes 'Over the Top' a film worth a look. The movie is also a testament to Stallone's ability to carry a film on his acting prowess - something one does not always feel in his more over-the-top (excuse the pun) actual action films.",Null,0,0,15 July 2016
Barry Lyndon," Trying to find your place in the world
","Best thought of as a film about uncertainty in life, this engrossing Stanley Kubrick drama chronicles the ups and down of an eighteenth century man whose fortunes constantly changes. Growing up, 'Barry Lyndon' was never one of my favourite Kubrick films; after all, the uncharismatic title character never changes very much and lacks personality. The narration also tends to reveal key events too early on for them to retain an emotional punch. A recent rewatch of 'Barry Lyndon' with 'A Clockwork Orange' fresh in mind was a revelation though. While one is set in the past and the other is set in the future, the two movies actually have a lot in common as they deal with young men trying to find their place in cruel and unfair worlds. Barry's breaking down into tears when unsure whether to spy on the Chevalier is reminiscent of Alex being kicked out of his parents' home with the same uncertainty of where to go and what to do, having been displaced from a once-familiar life. Emotionless as he sometimes seems, Barry makes for a highly sympathetic character too. Early in the piece is labeled as 'but a boy and does not signify more than (a) parrot or lap dog!', while later he is referred to as a 'common opportunist' and the film is mostly about Barry trying to change what others think about him for the better. Whatever the case, the film is very well tied together by the employment of non-original music, adapted from the likes of Schubert, Bach and Mozart. Almost every scene is set to music of some sort, and the final duel near the end is given nail-biting tension by the sombre music throbbing in the background.",Null,2,2,13 January 2017
Full Metal Jacket," My brief review of the film
","A fascinating, compelling and at times mesmirising depiction of the grueling nature of war and training for war. The film is done in two parts: training and the real thing. The transition makes the film seem confused about its purpose at first, however by the end of the film it ties in fine. The first section of the film is a masterpiece standard portrayal of preparing the troops for war, complete with a commanding performance by R. Lee Ermey. The second chapter is still tautly done  the intensity of which can be compared to the second space segment of the director's '2001: A Space Odyssey', however it is not as brilliant. Either way, the movie is always intense and very well shot throughout. However, although being high-powered, the film's condemnation of indoctrination is not very potent. Quite good nevertheless as another entry in Kubrick's collection of films documenting dehumanisation.",Null,2,4,14 January 2005
The Grapes of Wrath," My brief review of the film
","A historically important and extremely accurate portrayal of the times and experiences of those disadvantaged by the Depression. It shows how some Californians were inviting and the cruelty of others, and the film manages to expose exactly what the book aimed to expose in terms of the dehumanising effect of the Depression. The degree of accuracy of the film makes it at times painstakingly uneasy, but nonetheless the subject matter is given appropriate treatment. In terms of lighting, acting and direction it nears perfection too. The title refers to how some Californian farmers would spray kerosene on their leftover, rotting produce to stop new migrants from eating it, and that idea in itself haunts the whole film.",Null,2,6,22 January 2005
Lion," Vast Landscapes
","Essentially a film in two parts, the first hour of 'Lion' covers the struggles of a young Indian boy who gets separated from his family in the 1980s, while the second half deals with the boy now grown up, living with an adoptive family in Australia and keen to track his birth mother and actual family down. With a significant chunk of time omitted in between these time periods, 'Lion' never quite feels cohesive, however, both time periods are encapsulating and the film therefore manages to tell two compelling tales within the one film. With large, expressive eyes, first time actor Sunny Pawar as excellent as the protagonist as a boy who finds himself weary and unable to trust anyone after the separation from his family, and eerily enough, none of the authority figures he meets have even heard of his hometown. Equally as good is Dev Patel as the boy grown up who, after learning about Google Earth, becomes 'A Beautiful Mind'-like obsessed with tracking down his Indian family, quitting his job, walls covered in maps and pins, etc. This section of the film may have benefited from a greater depiction of the toll his quest has on his health (physical and mental) and livelihood, driven nearly over the brink by his unwillingness to tell his foster parents of his search, lest they be offended - however it is all interesting to watch all the same. Nicole Kidman is also solid in a small but pivotal role as his foster mother and the aerial photography throughout appropriately captures the vastness of not only India but Australia, emphasising just how significant an achievement his search is.",Null,1,2,20 January 2017
The Aviator," My brief review of the film
","A technically very well made film, helped by some fine acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda, it is nevertheless is not at all perfect viewing. Whilst the film is quite a satisfactory biopic, depicting Hughes' experiences well, it never feels deep at all, even though it tackles deep issues. The film just simply does little else other than show Hughes' life, and although that was the point of the film, it feels just a bit too lacking for it to be worthy of a second viewing. At almost three hours in length it feels much too long, and with almost all the supporting characters underdeveloped, it has little other than just its flashiness to hold one's interest. For the technical credits, which are very impressive, and for Leonard DiCaprio's solid performance, the film is worth watching. However I find little to recommend it as a film for which more can be taken out of it with a second viewing.",Null,6,12,17 February 2005
Léon: The Professional," Professionalism
","Also known as 'The Professional', this Luc Besson thriller follows the bond that grows between a loner hit-man and a preteen girl who he gives shelter to after her family is massacred. The film features several well crafted action sequences, a memorable escape from a seemingly inescapable situation and an excellent pulsating music score. The best asset here though is the unusual bond between the pair, which Besson carefully works through; as an impressionable near-teenager, the girl goes from viewing Léon as a saviour, to a father figure, to a mentor, to a potential lover, to simply a caring friend, and a young Natalie Portman hits every note perfectly in her portrayal (consider the respect she shoes Léon when he asks her not to smoke compared to her real father). Jean Reno is also fine as the hit-man, resisting temptation to lead her on when in her 'lover' phase. Not everything about Reno/Léon quite rings true. His constant drinking of milk (in lieu of liquor) and his affection for potted plants are obvious devices to soften the character, however, his life philosophy feels real at every turn, having to make some very hard choices; he even considers putting a bullet through Portman's head in her sleep to end her misery. The film's best performance though arguably comes from Gary Oldman, more maniacal than ever, talking gibberish about classical music and setting everyone around him on edge. The surrogate father/daughter angle is, however, what really propels the film. It highlights the ability of two lonely souls to connect in the crazy, violent world out there. Thoughtful stuff.",Null,0,1,18 April 2016
The Bourne Identity," Total Recall
","Pursued by unknown enemies, a worried amnesiac tries to remember who he is and why he has such sharp reflexes in this action thriller yarn. As the protagonists discovers a stash of fake passports, each with his photograph, and as police agencies seem to track his every move, the film has a decent dose of mysteriousness. The action sequences are well filmed and memorable too, with a scene in which lead actor Matt Damon scales a large wall and a sequence in which he has to allude an assassin (played by Clive Owen) in some cornfields standing out in particular. Clocking in at around two hours though, the film sometimes feels bloated with a lot of a cutaway sequences in which military types debate what to do about Damon; while these add exposition, they also subtract from the immediacy of the action. A heavily foreshadowed romance between Damon and Franka Potente, who gives him a ride, further distracts from the central plot and Damon's personal identity crisis is hardly all that juicy. The film is all about Damon embracing his old identity as opposed to something like 'Total Recall', which is about attempting to deflect from what one once was. That said, the eventual revelation of how Damon lost his memory comes with much bite with a haunting, near-silent scene on a luxury yacht at night. Damon's increasing anxiety at not being able to get answers comes across well too with some very good scenes in which he dials up various numbers asking for his names on his various passports in the desperate hope of some clue.",Null,0,0,7 March 2017
The Italian Job," Less a remake; more a homage
","More a homage to the 1969 heist caper than a true remake, the 2003 'The Italian Job' fascinatingly takes place in a universe in which the Michael Caine film exists with our heroes plotting to carry out a heist and 'do it like 'The Italian Job''. What similarities exist between the films are entirely due to the characters here taking inspiration, and the parallels are very few, one chase sequence aside. With an essentially new plot, we are treated to better fleshed out characters. Donald Sutherland only appears briefly, but the surrogate father bond between him and Mark Wahlberg (in the Caine role) is so strong that it provides ample motivation. The chemistry between the characters sizzles more here too. There is a lot of great repartee and some genuine laugh-out-loud bits, such as Seth Green imitating Jason Statham, accent and all. More interesting as the characters may be though, the performances are not quite as good. Wahlberg is particularly ineffectual - too withdrawn and uncharismatic for the leader of his gang, and his predictable romance with Charlize Theron lacks sparks. Some of the stunt work is also a tad over-elaborate. There is an instance in which Wahlberg survives a glass window shattering in his face without any cuts or bruises. For the most part though, this is a very impressive remake, just as effective upon revision, and if it were not for a corny ending, one might even argue it as superior to the original.",Null,0,1,27 December 2015
Baby Driver," Driven
","Hoping to settle a debt with a crime boss, an orphaned young man works as a getaway driver, but severing ties with the crime boss when his debt is paid off proves challenging in this violent comedy thriller from Edgar Wright. The basic plot of 'Baby Driver' is hardly new or original and the romantic subplot that develops could have done with more work, but the film is still frequently engaging due to Wright's brisk pacing of the material and constant incorporation of iconic songs. The protagonist suffers from tinnitus (and listens to music as often as possible to drown out the noises in his ears) and Wright uses this plot point as a launching pad to make his film about the connection that we as individuals tend to feel between music and action. In one of the most interesting scenes, the protagonist delays a quick getaway in a stolen car while finding music with the right beat for his mood. This could perhaps be chalked up to obsessive compulsiveness, but with side scenes in which he records and mixes voices, creating his own music, the film makes it very clear how much he adores music. Add in some impressively choreographed on-foot chases (as well as car chases) and this is a riveting little movie. It may not have anything particularly enlightening to say about crime and the difficulties of turning over a new leaf, but there is at least nary a dull moment to be had.",Null,0,2,5 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'it has some interesting elements'
","A spectacular-looking fantasy adventure with the feel of an epic, but yet missing too much to truly rate as an epic. The cinematography is breathtaking (albeit it actually mostly computer generated), the makeup is admirable and some of the set design is really good, but yet in terms of screenplay it ultimately dull. Converting the first part of 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy novel into a film seemed to be an impossible feat at the time of the film's production, as the books were full of so many essential details that they would not be satisfying without all the content. Nevertheless the producers went ahead, trimming things here and there, creating overall a good-looking film but one in which the events are unclear and the plot is too convoluted to be understood by anyone not familiar with Tolkein's novel. The concept of character developed is abandoned in the epic swoop of the film, creating a not very involving watch. The film is very lengthy, which should not be a problem in the best of epics, but in this one it just leaves a bad taste, as there is no reason to care what actually happens. The film indeed brews a tendency to bore at times, and the action sequences are not only mindless, but are too violent for younger audiences, which is a shame as the 'The Lord of the Rings' is excellent for enthusiastic young readers. On the other hand, there are a number of positives to the film, as it is technically interesting, but that is not enough to make it a very good watch  at the most it is an above average film, because it has some interesting elements. It is just a shame that the cinematic virtues of the film were not given more justice by the screenplay. The original cut was 270 minutes, and judged on the overkill length of this version, two parts to the film would have perhaps worked better. Or perhaps Tolkein's novels would have been better untouched by live action film.",Null,14,28,14 January 2005
Grease," Mixed messages but great songs and choreography
","One of the most well-known and widely celebrated motion picture musicals of all time, there is no questioning how iconic the songs and hairstyles of 'Grease' are. The film benefits from spirited choreography and imaginative costumes, plus the film paints quite a vivid picture of 1950s high school life. All of this flashiness and vigour comes at the expense of good characters and a solid story though. It speaks volumes that Stockard Channing's unwanted pregnancy has more dramatic weight in an elaborate subplot than the 'will they or won't they?' question that hangs over the two leads, both of whom are self-obsessed teens who we could hardly care less about. He is a jerk who only cares about acting cool, and she seems pleasant, but is prepared to change her entire appearance just because he's the one who she wants. So much for feminism! The film does not work that well as a comedy either. Some of the song lyrics are funny, especially the interjections from Travolta's friends during 'Summer Nights', but there is an absolutely groan-inducing gym training scene in the mix in which Travolta's lack of physical fitness is awkwardly played for laughs, and nothing ever really seems as funny as the opening animated credits. The film certainly suffices as mindless entertainment, but for a musical that spends more time depicting 50s high school life, more time on gags and more time exploring its characters, 'Cry-Baby' is recommended as a worthwhile alternative.",Null,0,1,14 December 2015
28 Weeks Later," Weeks and Weeks
","Set six months after the events of '28 Days Later...', the rage virus is thought to be under control until another unexpected outbreak occurs in this sequel to the Danny Boyle horror film. With a plot description like that, '28 Weeks Later' might sound like a shameless copy of its predecessor, but it is actually refreshingly different during its first half with helicopter shots of a deserted London in ruins and lots of bureaucratic issues as various soldiers try to control the re-population of the city. Robert Carlyle is also saddled with a curiously morally ambiguous main character who we see abandon his wife early on in a desperate attempt to survive a zombie attack. The second half of the film is nowhere near as solid its the build-up though as the movie descends into mindless zombie attacks that never really resonate that much since Carlyle's kids here are never quite as interesting or well developed as the main characters of the original movie. The ending certainly leaves a bit to think about in terms of how our humanity may end up only making things worse were a zombie plague ever to come our way, though the way it paves way for a potential third movie to come is very unsubtle.",Null,0,2,3 November 2017
He Got Game," Hoop Dreaming
","Released for a week from prison in a shady deal in which he has to convince his son to sign with a particular university, the father of a basketball prodigy struggles to reconnect with his teenage children in this Spike Lee drama. While basketball is a prominent theme and the film opens with majestic shots of various kids poetically playing the game, this is less a sports movie and more a study of estranged relationships with Denzel Washington and Ray Allen having close to equal screen time as father and son respectfully. Allen is nowhere near as polished an actor as Washington, but he has a nicely complex character, torn between offers from various universities, the wishes of his girlfriend, a desire to take responsibility for his sister and lots of resentment towards his father. Lee also admirably avoids spelling out Washington's criminal conviction until partway in, which gives us a chance to gradually warm to his character before discovering his heinous past actions. The film runs a little long with a subplot involving a hooker next door that could have been omitted completely; the ending is also a tad too maudlin for its own good. The vast majority of the film tugs on the right emotional strings though and together with some awesome music and excellent camera-work as per Lee par, this is a compelling watch regardless of one's interest in the sport of basketball.",Null,0,0,24 September 2017
The Revenant," Return
","Left for dead by his companions after being mauled by a bear, an 1820s fur trapper traverses tough terrain to avenge the murder of his son in this epic scale drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Lasting several minutes, the bear attack is very graphic and between the brooding score (co-written by the masterful Ryuichi Sakamoto) and Emmanuel Lubezki's mobile cinematography, 'The Revenant' is often appropriately moody and atmospheric. There is, however, little escaping how relatively simple the plot it is, and as DiCaprio predictably comes across mounting obstacles while trying to locate Hardy, the movie soon turns repetitive. The fact that it takes him the better part of two hours to locate Hardy lessens the tension; his quest is dragged out for so long that his bloodlust fades into the background. More scenes establishing the bond between DiCaprio and his son may have helped, but the film might have also simply been more potent at half the length (twice the intensity). Certainly the contrast between the lush yet hostile landscapes and the hatred at hand renders the film interesting and with thoughtfully accentuated audio effects and the aforementioned virtues, this is a hard film not to recommend. It does take an incredible amount of patience to get through, however, and awesome as the ending may well be, the journey to get there often feels overly protracted.",Null,0,0,6 May 2017
Bridge of Spies," A flawed but interesting insight into Cold War tension
","Based on the true story of an American insurance lawyer who wound up negotiating spy exchanges during the Cold War, 'Bridge of Spies' does a sterling job depicting tensions and insecurities during one of the most volatile periods in US history. While the focus of the film is always the American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, the film successfully weaves in several subplots that hint at what it was like to live during the Cold War. Most potently, the lawyer's son becomes obsessed with preparing for nuclear disaster after watching one too many propaganda films at school. Not so successfully woven in are two subplots involving the men who Hanks has to negotiate getting back in exchange for a captured Russian spy. The time-line of events in the film is also a little incredulous; no sooner has Hanks pleaded for the Russian's spy life to be spared in case of prisoner exchange is a prisoner exchange suddenly put on the table. Never to mind, Mark Rylance is superb as the Russian spy who hilariously keeps asking 'would it help?' whenever Hanks asks him if he is worried. In fact, there is quite a bit of oddball humour in the film (Burghart Klaussner answering the wrong phone, etc), which can probably be chalked up to the Coen Brothers script. Furthermore, one of the film's strongest assets is how it balances light humour and very grim drama. As icing on the cake, the film looks superb with accurate period sets/costumes and lots of fluid, mobile camera-work from Janusz Kaminski. Thomas Newman provides an effective score too in lieu of John Williams.",Null,1,3,23 November 2015
Pitch Black," In Darkness
","When their spaceship crashes on an outskirts planet, fears mount in regards to an incarcerated convicted murderer who fled captivity in the crash, however, the crew and passengers soon find something far more terrifying on the planet itself in this action thriller with a sci-fi twist. Relatively simple as the premise may be, it is undeniably effective with the film's best moments coming from the crew and passengers scurrying about in fear of Vin Diesel's killer, accidentally shooting one another in the process. The tension is not quite the same once Diesel decides to unite with the group to overcome the vicious alien presence on the planet, but there is still plenty to ponder over as all concerned find it so hard to trust Diesel even in the face of a very real alien threat. As for the alien presence on the planet, it brings up a whole gigantic slate of unanswered, perplexing questions, particularly in relation to their allergy to sunlight. Then there is the amazing coincidence of the characters crash landing just before the planet is about to plunge into several days of complete darkness - but this is a pretty decent film when one focuses on trust/mistrust themes and the portrait of diverse individuals all banded together in the name of a common goal to survive. Diesel is very good too in the role that really kick-started his career; he has an awesome line towards the end about saying good night, and with his blacked-out contact lenses and designer goggles, his character leaves an indelible impression that lasts long after the movie has ended.",Null,4,5,26 March 2017
Split," Kidnapped
","Upon discovering that the man who has kidnapped them has a multiple personality disorder, three teenage girls try to manipulate his more benevolent personalities into helping them escape in this horror thriller from M. Night Shyamalan. The film features two distinct plot lines as the kidnapper, played James McAvoy, separately converses with his psychiatrist and interacts with the girls he has kidnapped. Tension sometimes dissipates as the film switches back and forth, but McAvoy's intense and unsettlingly unpredictable performance keeps the film is chugging along. The best performance though comes from Anya Taylor-Joy (of 'The VVitch' fame) as the most introverted of the three kidnapped teens who nevertheless knows the best ways to deal with their abductor; Shyamalan's camera constantly hangs close to her face as her wide-open eyes and nervous glances convey volumes. As the film progresses, we gradually learn that she has suffered past trauma as per McAvoy, though the film's reluctance to explore her past experiences in depth (we only get the briefest of suggestive flashbacks) never feels right. The element of the film that sits least comfortably though is the fact that we are told that McAvoy has 23 distinct personalities, yet we only ever see eight of them and we are given no compelling reasons why he would have so many personalities aside from it sounding rather creepy. That said, the film offers several thought-provoking views on individuals with such a condition, questioning whether they are not in fact 'more evolved' and whether curing such a condition is really the answer.",Null,1,9,5 February 2017
Cold Mountain," My brief review of the film
","A strongly acted and always interesting portrait of the hardships that came with the American Civil War, not only for soldiers but for those who did not fight too. The times are portrayed well, with sets and costumes that cannot be faulted. What can be flawed in the film however is the central romance, which is without much spark or realism. But all the action surrounding the romance is great, with some good-natured humorous touches, wonderful supporting characters and the perfect picture overall of life during the American Civil War. The cast is superb, with Zellweger in particular undergoing a superb transformation from her typical roles. The film is generally well written and well directed by Minghella, so that in spite of a lackluster romance, the film is still a captivating and entertaining watch.",Null,68,97,8 December 2004
The Shining," My brief review of the film
","A great horror story from Stephen King is given the Kubrick treatment here, which results in sheer brilliance, only weighed down by a confused storyline. The story has not only been adapted but also it has been manipulated by Kubrick, giving the film an uneasy ambivalence, especially at the end. Other than the screenplay, the film rarely faults, and it is always intense and intriguing to watch, even when one does not understand. Technically, it is an ultimate horror experience, with a rather sterling production design and excellent cinematography. Great sound effects and an underplayed haunting music score are able to create an astonishing atmosphere that is perfect for the film. Also generally well acted and rather well directed, it is a shame that the screenplay lets a bravura horror film down, even if it is still excellent nonetheless.",Null,6,14,17 January 2005
American Beauty," My extended review of the film
","'American Beauty' is a film about people and how they live. At times it is a biting satire with sharp wit and acute observations, at other times it is a deep drama about unhappy individuals in American suburbia, but all the time I found it an enjoyable film to view, both because of the things it has to say and the high cinematic quality of the production. The best part of the film would probably be Alan Ball's original screenplay. It is alternates from amusing and touching, perceptive and funny, and the characters are all very well developed and feel real. A common complaint I hear about the film is that the characters are thin, but they are just the opposite. We acquire an understanding of what makes each character tick and what each characters wants out of life. Some are motivated by the idea of success and luxuries, while other are prepared to settle for a simpler lifestyle. Some of the characters also have their own individual secrets that are revealed towards the end, and by watching the film again one can pick up their insecurities about their secrets.Another complaint I often hear is that the film is too literal and straightforward. This however is quite a subjective judgment, as where does one draw the line between a film being too complex and not complex enough? If a film is overly complex and too hard to extract meaning out of, sure some people would look deeper, but others will be put off. I feel that 'American Beauty' has quite a good balance between how much it blatantly states and how much you can extract by closer examination, and what is said out loud is not unnatural. It is in that way a film that can be enjoyed by almost all people: casual moviegoers and avid film buffs alike.There is not really much else that people tend to complain about, and really there is hardly anything at all to not like. The types of flaws that one might find in the film are what you expect to find if judging whether one of two films in an all time top 100 list is the better of the two. They are not the type of flaws that should affect one's viewing experience, unless of course one expected to find something more in the film than it offered. But that again is subjective.The technical aspects of the film are wonderful. Thomas Newman's score is very low-key and simple when needed, and more zapped when required. Conrad L. Hall has meticulously set up every single shot. His use of out-of-focus backgrounds and foregrounds, high and low camera angels, and swooping shot is perfect. The film all flows very well, and some jump cut editing is perfectly woven in. The set décor and art direction paint a colourful picture of suburbia but yet they also manage to bring out the monotony of all the individual places. Plus the use of the colour red in the film basically speaks for itself.To compliment the film's other virtues, the cast give it their best with good results. Each actor and actress perfectly suits their characters, and it a shame about the lack of acclaim given to many of the performances. Spacey and Bening do some brilliant stuff as a discontent couple who are learning individually to enjoy life but yet are still full of anger, and Birch is perfect as their insecure teenage daughter. But the often unmentioned great performances come from Chris Cooper as the army type new neighbour, Wes Bentley as his teenage son, and Alison Janney as his wife, who seems just a little too detached from life. Then of course there is Mena Suvari as Birch's school friend who values her looks above everything.This is a film that touches on many different human concerns. Beauty, as in the title, is a key theme, and ideas about different perceptions of beauty run throughout the film. Bentley films a number of sequences on his camcorder, and we are shown the digital pictures. There are also the windows that everyone uses to spy on one another. People see things in many different ways because we are all different, yet we are all striving for a common goal of contentment, and the film tries to show this. 'American Beauty' starts off as a mystery thriller because we know that Spacey has died and that Birch has asked someone to kill him, but the mystery is the end is how we all function and how we are able to find happiness in life.",Null,5,10,26 April 2005
BASEketball," Near Sporting Satire
","Two longtime friends responsible for inventing a new national sport attempt to keep their game pure and free of corruption in this vibrant comedy starring 'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. While neither Parker nor Stone is given writing credit, the movie is full of their trademark vulgar humour and for those not easily offended, there are some truly hilarious parts. At least a quarter of the jokes are too silly or crude to work (particularly the nude locker room scene) but the majority of gags hit home with some especially funny moments with Parker and Stone oblivious to mayhem happening in the background. The film misses the mark somewhat as a sporting satire though. As much fun as it is to have Robert Vaughn as a slimy, underhanded antagonist, it never really works to have Vaughn alone represent everything supposedly wrong with the sporting world as he wants players to switch teams and locations, wants to make a profit from sports merchandise, wants to manufacture the merchandise under child labour, and the list goes on. Ernest Borgnine's acting talents are also never quite maximised, though he does make the most of his half-senile, ageing team owner with one of the craziest video wills ever committed to screen! The film's big plus on the acting front is actually Parker and Stone. The repartee and chemistry between the pair is undeniable and they genuinely come off as overwhelmed by their newfound success and fame, much like they were experiencing in real life back then as 'South Park' found a bigger audience than either of them ever anticipated.",Null,0,0,12 June 2016
Warrior," Brothers
","Tensions flare up even further between two estranged brothers when they discover that they are both competing in the same mixed martial arts tournament in this frequently rousing if rather predictable sports drama. It is not hard to guess early on which two competitors will end fighting for first place and the whole idea of the brothers being brought back together after so many years to erase the bad blood between them is hardly spectacular. The performances are, however, solid throughout with Joel Edgerton crafting a highly sympathetic character out of his high school science teacher turned fighter, set on the top prize to pay off the bank and preventing them repossessing his house. Jennifer Morrison is pretty good as his wife too, even if she is reduced to mere reaction shots towards the end. As the other brother, Tom Hardy's reasons for fighting are not quite as compelling, but he delivers well too, though the best of the very best performance of the film comes from Oscar nominated Nick Nolte as the recovering alcoholic father of the two men who sees an opportunity to get his family back, if only his two sons do not kill themselves in the ring. The fight scenes are compelling too, though they only occur in the second half of the movie and clocking in at almost two and a half hours, this is not a light and breezy affair. It is, however, more encapsulating than one might imagine given the formulaic premise and familiar sibling rivalry themes, which really goes to show how much can be achieved simply by casting all pivotal roles exceptionally well.",Null,1,2,10 February 2017
We're the Millers," Miller's Crossing
","Blackmailed into smuggling drugs across the Mexican border, a small-time drug dealer lures three social misfits to pose as his family to avoid suspicion in this energetic comedy starring Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter. The zest of the film lies with the principal cast, all of whom are in top form. The film particularly comes alive as the foursome jump back and forth between assuming family stereotype roles from overprotective parent, to concerned sister to confused son and so on. There are also several great moments as they keep running into a vacationing police officer and his wife, who turn out to be less conservative than they first appear, while the likes of Luis Guzmán and Ed Helms have great cameo roles. As a comedy, the film is nevertheless uneven with several gags that are telegraphed way too far in advance (walking in on the kissing; the spider bite) and the antagonists are a bit too comical to be fearsome, but when the film does work, it shines. There is a hilarious line regarding a local Apple Store and some great running gags. Fans of Jennifer Aniston will probably take interest in her striptease scene, though the best gag with her happens during the closing credits. Flawed as it may be, 'We're the Millers' is certainly an amusing look at four lonely individuals who, quite by chance, form a really good surrogate family.",Null,0,0,27 August 2017
Edward Scissorhands," My brief review of the film
","A visually magnificent, magical fable, the film features some striking sets and great makeup, which are well photographed in different artistic colours and lights. Depp is good as the title character, however the character itself is hardly a good point of the film. As our hero, the film feels rather cold, because there is a distance between the viewer and the protagonist, to whom the viewer is never really brought close. The story, besides for the scissor hands gimmick, is nothing new or original, and it is rather a bit predictable. Yet with such a grand visual style, the film is able to survive primarily on the visual goodies that Burton provides. It is entertaining as something rather unusual and different, but it is not good enough to do better.",Null,0,0,19 January 2005
Collateral," My brief review of the film
","A technically rather well made and rather slickly directed thriller, the film delivers thrills as well as some character study. It is still a bit on the routine side nevertheless, with very typical thriller moments, a typical thriller twist, and not enough depth to the characterisation for it to be worth the extra length, as the film felt too long. Had it a shorter running time, and had it been more believable and less contrived, it would have been quite a film. But with good technical credits to its virtue, and Jamie Foxx in an effective Oscar-nominated performance, it is still a very solid film nonetheless.",Null,0,2,12 February 2005
Cross of Iron," Straw Soldiers
","The title here refers to the Iron Cross, a German medal for bravery, as the story focuses on one Nazi officer so set on achieving the titular medal that he recklessly puts the safety of his platoon, behind Russian enemy lines, into danger. Maximilian Schell is solid as always as the self-interested commander in question, though he is ultimately a supporting character here as the film is told from the prospective of a recently promoted sergeant in his platoon, played by James Coburn. The storyline is a little messy and comes off as more a series of episodes than a coherent narrative, and yet this chaos is somewhat appropriate for a movie about the madness of war. Memorable elements include Coburn warming to a Russian orphan who he takes back to his bunker, a couple of a latent homosexual soldiers facing off with Schell and a terrific sequence in which Coburn hallucinates while being nursed in hospital, with an excellent editing design perfectly capturing his confused state of mind. The film features a lot of quotable dialogue too and there is something to say for the film's uniqueness in showing the German side of things without demonising (all of) them. One does have to tolerate a lot of Sam Peckinpah's trademark quirks here - most notably, excessive slow motion shots - but the overall movie leaves an indelible impression, chaotic and frenzied as it may be.",Null,1,3,27 June 2017
Goon," Hockey Hurts
","Recruited by an ice hockey team, a bouncer discovers that the game is less about scoring goals and more about bashing the life out of his opponents in this sports comedy from Canada. Seann William Scott provides an earnest turn as the protagonist who has no interest in violence beyond defending others and there is a sweet romantic subplot further humanises him. The film is undermined though by focusing on all the fights that Scott gets into on the ice as opposed to the hockey games. All that ice hockey here seems to involve for Canadians is players clashing into one another and beating each other to pulp -- basically, boxing on ice -- and as someone unfamiliar with the sport, it is baffling how all the fights are championed by referees and considered part of the game. If anything like what occurs here happened in a soccer game, it would be an instant red/yellow card! Put more simply, one's mileage with the film may vary depending on one's familiarity with Canadian ice hockey; for a layman though, this is basically just a film about gory fights on ice. It is not particularly funny either with a gay brother and conservative, adoptive Jewish parents coming off as quirky for the sake of it. Sure, the film has some heart with Scott's gradual rise to fame and desire to be considered a real hockey player when he can barely skate, but this is a hard film to recommend to non-ice hockey fans.",Null,0,0,23 July 2017
Ocean's Eleven," My brief review of the film
","Clever and amusing fun, Soderbergh puts in some nice touches here and there, but the film is weighed down by being a bit of a conventional crime caper, with nothing new to add except a different clever theft scheme. It is, however, the character that Julia Roberts plays who really brings the film down a lot, as she is unnecessary to the plot, except for spicing up a familiar revenge theme, which the film does not work all that well with, and hence could have done without. As entertaining as the film is to watch, it is far from perfect, not only because of Julia Roberts, but a number of others marks of conventionality too.",Null,0,0,9 January 2005
Jackie," Iron Lady
","As per 'The Iron Lady', this is not a straightforward biographical drama but rather a stream of consciousness style movie that flips between timelines while examining Jackie Kennedy with a particular focus on the events immediately preceding and following her husband's assassination. While the narrative is framed by an interview with a reporter, all other time periods are very much blurred. This approach occasionally makes the film difficult to follow, but it certainly gets inside the title character's mind as she processes both the aftermath of the assassination and the event itself, questioning and self-doubting whether she could have done more to help her husband and prevent him dying. Clocking in at around 100 minutes though, the film feels incredibly long for what it is and rather repetitive with much of the screen time dedicated to Jackie's decisions regarding funeral procession arrangements for her husband. Whatever the case, Natalie Portman hardly ever hits a false note in the lead role. Some have criticised her performance as very mannered, but that seems very much on point: she is a public figure, constantly forced to put on a certain face with the smallest of moments (wiping JFK's blood off her clothes and face) all that is needed to suggest depth beyond the mask. The film also benefits from another haunting, moody score by 'Under the Skin' composer Mica Levi and archive footage is well spliced throughout. 'Jackie' is not an easy film to sit through and may have worked better at half its length, but it definitely resonates in the mind afterwards.",Null,1,3,17 January 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fight for a Reason
","Based on a popular series of graphic novels, this elaborate action comedy focuses on an unemployed youth who finds his life turning into a video game in which he has to 'battle' an attractive girl's exes to secure her heart. Director Edgar Wright uses several dreamy scene transitions to establish a blur between reality and fantasy early on with characters in one frame seeming to interact with the action in the next frame. The film is also populated with eye-popping special effects, ranging from info graphics to words and lines that jump off the screen to comic book style punches and blows during the fights. In short, it is visually arresting motion picture through and through. The universe in which the film exists does not always ring true though. Much of the fun comes from how lead Michael Cera is absolutely baffled by the superhero-ish powers of the exes, but nobody else seems to think anything of comic style fights breaking out in the middle of concerts or on movie sets. None of the fights come with much sense of danger either as Cera bounces back being dropped and whacked unscathed like a cartoon character. Never to mind, the film offers a sufficiently engaging parable of the issues facing young adults today with everything that occurs in the film highly metaphorical. It is about Cera standing up for himself (and to himself!), getting over his old girlfriend who he is still pining for, and going the extra mile to win the heart of a girl he fancies. Whether he ends up with the right girl is debatable, but the journey alone is worth experiencing at least once.",Null,0,0,1 January 2017
Gone with the Wind," My brief review of the film
","Addictive as well as engaging, this is the perfect soap opera: a romance film that is not only thoroughly entertaining but also enjoyably educational. The insight into Southern life is wonderful, and the film manages to capture excellently the experience of the Civil War and how it changed people. It is long, but as a result involving because the characters are constructed excellently and played by the cast dynamically. Olivia De Hallivand is especially good, and Vivien Leigh is the perfect lead. The Technicolor sets are delightful: an example of art direction with the focus truly on art. The film is so well done that even the special effects are remarkable for the time! This is one of the greatest epics ever produced, and an example (which has hardly ever been equaled) of how to make a flawless one.",Null,6,12,15 January 2005

","A well made action film, especially of its sort, it constantly tackles below surface ideas, such as justice, fighting crime, fears and corruption, while at the same time the film offers exciting action on the surface. The visual effects are very effective, and the overall visual style suits the project very well. Cillian Murphy is worth noting for an intriguing performance, even if the rest of the cast members only act adequately. The film is somewhat slow to build up, focusing on some of the story elements for too long, but once the film gets going, it is superb. There are certain imperfections that one generally accepts in these types of movie blockbusters. Yes, the on screen romance is dull, but at least here it is not a useless subplot. Yes, some of the characters are inserted just for laughs, and not to add anything to the story. Yes, even some of the necessary characters have pointless moments of comic relief. Yes, the special effects tend to go over-the-top here and there. However, do all these points really matter? If you are expecting a flawless masterpiece then they do, and you will not find such a film here. But, if you just want to see an action film that is a cut above the rest, this is a great example: a film that is engaging both below as well as above the surface.",Null,5,7,4 August 2005
Liar Liar," Truth hurts
","Unable to lie as a result of a birthday wish, a lawyer who has built his career on fibs discovers how hard it is to tell the truth all the time in this Jim Carrey comedy vehicle. The premise is fairly decent with the overarching question of whether it is possible to live without lying a little. One of the film's best scenes has Carrey insulting all the partners and senior members of his law firm simply by telling the truth as he sees it, which they mistake for practical joking (why else would anyone be so insolent?). Most of the film though does not capitalise on this agenda as Carrey constantly chews the scenery, making absurd noises and weird faces as he struggles to lie. In fact, the film's funniest bit comes in the end credits blooper reel as Swoosie Kurtz calls him an 'overactor' - though there is also a fun part in which he tells his son that not only will his face not freeze if the wind changes, but in fact some people (Carrey) make living out of making funny faces! The film does not stack up particular well to repeat viewings though since much of the plot hinges on Carrey doing the unexpected, and beyond Carrey's facial antics, the father/son angle is just schmaltzy. There is also something uncomfortable in how the film wants us to cheer for Carrey getting an adulterous client off the hook and cheer for Carrey himself, who only ever seems like an obnoxious human being. The film does have several genuinely hilarious moments though in between Carrey's mugging though and it does highlight how much society is built on white lies, but 'Liar Liar' is really a Carrey showcase all the way.",Null,0,0,18 January 2016
Zulu," My brief review of the film
","Reasonably well made on an appropriate budget, the film uses good locations, has a great set design, an exciting score as well as some commendable camera-work, but it is overall not quite as good as perhaps it could have been. Some of the sequences are a bit clichéd, and there is a severe lack of background information, but the biggest problem comes from something that would have not been a problem at the time of the film's release. Nowadays, the typical viewer is educated to sympathise with the Zulus, rather than the invading British, and in the film, the Zulus are all one dimensional and the British characters are not developed too well themselves, which makes it a bit hard to know who to sympathise with. Towards the end, the fighting sequences also become quite monotonous, but there are some parts that are interesting. It is a quite well made film overall and Caine is quite effective in a very early screen role, but it is not near perfect, and to a modern audience there is a question of how effective it would be.",Null,1,3,16 June 2005
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Force of Evil
","An unfortunate series of accidents leads to a group of college kids (who have seen 'Deliverance' one too many times) assuming that a couple of friendly hillbillies are psychotic murderers in this hilarious horror film that wittily subverts the 'backwoods brutality' subgenre. The film even begins, as one would expect, with the college kids in focus, scared out of their wits as the two hillbillies stare at them as they briefly drive by. Soon afterwards though, we are treated to the hillbillies' perspective and they remain empathetic throughout, especially as dead bodies pile up around them, completely oblivious to the fact that the college students think that they are serial killers. The fun diminishes somewhat as the pair realise that the college kids have a vendetta against them, but even so, the film remains interesting to watch as the brats essentially create their own downfalls, with their paranoia and instinctive distrust leading to their demise. Occasionally the film falls into clichÃ©, but there is something deliciously postmodern to the way the film daringly swims against genre expectations. The movie also manages to address some issues revolving around confidence and misunderstandings based on unfair assumptions and the title characters are fleshed out in incredible depth for such a short (under 90 minute) feature with both Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine great in the roles.",Null,0,0,11 July 2017
Foxcatcher," Outfoxed
","Invited to train for the Seoul Olympics at a facility run by an eccentric millionaire, a young wrestler struggles to maintain his sanity in this downbeat but engrossing drama based on a true story. The project is carefully directed by Bennett Miller who deliberately paces the material with many elongated silent shots of the protagonist just sitting around and contemplating. This might not sound particularly interesting, but with Channing Tatum in solid form as the wrestler in question, all these non-action based moments give us a great glimpse into his mind. Steve Carell is also excellent in a supporting turn (the BAFTAs got the category correct) as the mysterious millionaire with an unspoken hidden agenda. On one hand, it is a little underwhelming how the dynamics of Carell and Tatum's friendship are only ever implied with only some suggestion of Carell liking Tatum as more than just a friend; on the other hand, there is a lot to admire in how Miller leaves it up to our imagination regarding the highs, lows and rifts between the pair. Mark Ruffalo is also terrific as Tatum's brother, though he is far less subdued. Providing far more questions than answers regarding what occurred between the real life Mark Schultz and John Du Pont, 'Foxcatcher' does not necessarily offer the most satisfying narrative out there, but there is much to like in how moody and unsettling an experience it is.",Null,0,0,24 September 2017
JFK," My brief review of the film
","Regardless of how much is fact and how much is fiction, this is an engrossing and enthralling political thriller, expertly shot and brilliantly edited, combining movie footage, photographs and drawings, as well as a whole lot more. The ensemble cast behind the film is amazing: full of Oscar winners and acclaimed performers, all who deliver well. The only striking flaw in the film is the pacing. It feels far too rushed and far too speedily put together, considering the heaviness of the content. The film could have actually done with a four hour running time, as this would not only slow the film to a better pace, but it would allow some room for a study into obsession - a theme that feels neglected in all the excitement. This is a gripping piece of cinema as it is, but there is some room for improvement.",Null,1,11,23 July 2005
Django Unchained," Years a Slave
","An unlikely friendship develops between a 1850s slave and a German- born bounty hunter who frees him to assist with tracking down three wanted men in this Quentin Tarantino western. The gradual bond between the pair always feels very real, though the plot is more complicated than just that as the partners plan an ambitious quest to rescue the slave's wife from a sadistic plantation owner, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Jumping between serious drama and quirky comedy (ambushers bantering about the bags on their head), it is easy to see why the film might not jive with everyone's sensibilities, but there is a lot to like about the complex characters as well as the way Tarantino generates laughs in a story about one of the ugliest parts of American history. Christoph Waltz is superb as the German bounty hunter, and not just due to delivering excellent comic relief. He is a true outsider in the racist America of the 1850s, and his character's growing disgust with the way slaves are treated really resonates; much like Oskar Schindler's character progression, he may have initially been into killing slave traders for the profits, but by the final hour of the film, there is much more passion to it. Some have been critical of the film's very violent third act, but if nothing else, it comes off well as a response to DiCaprio's questions about submissiveness and the film concludes on a surefire memorable note.",Null,0,1,13 May 2017
Get Out," Meet the Parents
","Nervous about meeting his Caucasian girlfriend's parents, a young African American struggles to work out if everyone is acting strangely around him or if it is just his imagination in this unusual mystery thriller. The film is very deliberately paced with lots of malice foreshadowed but exposition only revealed in tiny chunks along the way. In fact, utterly unsettling as the pre-credits sequence is, it is hard not to wonder whether the film would have been better without it since it is the only scene for quite a while that spells out the horror slant of 'Get Out' beneath its quirky façade. That said, there are enough elements that remain elusive here that the film stays enticing until the end. The final quarter also comes off as a very clever homage to the horror movies of the 1970s, complete with appropriate furniture for the period. What really elevates the film though is its social satire. The racism agenda is a little on-the-nose, but the protagonist's anxiety at being a 'token' African American really clicks, forced to enter into awkward conversations with several houseguests at one point who have no idea how to talk to him without sounding racist. It is actually quite a universal predicament and aside from being a captivating mystery movie, 'Get Out' also pinpoints how strange it can be to interact in an environment when one is a minority, whether it be by race, religion, gender, age or other factors.",Null,23,43,6 May 2017
Drive," Driven
","A stunt driver's life is thrown into disarray after befriending a lonely young mother and her son in this crime drama directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling. 'Drive' is a curious to film watch with Refn's subsequent features fresh in mind. With a more traditional narrative than 'Only God Forgives' and 'The Neon Demon', it is little wonder that audiences took more kindly to this earlier film than Refn's follow-up efforts, however, Refn excels when directing sequences that are dreamy, nightmarish and mysterious and there are less such sequences here due to the more conventional narrative. That said, 'Drive' is still very visually alluring with its nighttime shots set to Cliff Martinez's atmospheric score standing out in particular. Gosling is also more compelling here than in 'Only God Forgives' despite playing a character equally as laconic with equally sketchy background details. The connection he makes with the mother and her son always feels very real with little need for small talk between them. A montage of the trio playing by a lake is way too cute, blatant and unnecessary, but generally speaking, the bond between them radiates in remarkably subtle ways. The limited background for Gosling's character (only ever known as 'The Kid') work fairly well too. Of course, one desperately wants to know more about how he ticks, but by keeping him at a distance, it makes it easier for Refn to spin here what could be considered a parable for the chaos that comes into one's life with a partner and child to support.",Null,0,0,18 February 2017
The Theory of Everything," Brief History of Hawking's Time
","Diagnosed with an incurable debilitating disease, British scientist Stephen Hawking defies odds and continues his important research, even after losing the ability to speak, in this biographical drama from acclaimed documentarian James Marsh. Credibly capturing Hawking's gradually declining health, Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance, but it is actually co-star Felicity Jones who has the film's best moments as his wife, struggling to remain strong and not cave into a desire for normality. She has a particularly touching part in which she tries to get her resistant husband to use a 'spelling board'. Given that the film is based on Jane Hawking's autobiographical account of her time with her ex-husband, it is unsurprising that Jones is given such a juicy character and so much focus; the film is equally about her as Hawking. And yet, Marsh's attempts to balance the film being about both leads to it falling short as an insight into the mind of the scientific genius. Hawking's theories are often pushed into the background compared to something like 'A Beautiful Mind' which had plenty of scenes dedicated to John Nash's thought processes. Supported by an excellent Jóhann Jóhannsson score and detailed sets and costumes, this is certainly a handsome production, but those interested in a film more about Stephen than Jane Hawking may need to look elsewhere.",Null,1,1,24 April 2017
Room," The World
","Abducted and held in a backyard shed with a young son fathered by her captor, a young woman attempts to escape in this grim drama starring Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Some of the finer plot details do not quite add up (in seven years of captivity, she should have been able to work out a four digit security code) and the first half of the movie is a tad repetitive. Things gets more interesting in the second half though with the escape plan in action and superb point-of-view shots as we literally and metaphorically see the world for the first time through the young boy's eyes. Tremblay is excellent as the youngster in question; not all his temper tantrums ring true, but he is great in the quieter moments in which he simply sits back and observes. In fact, the film is more about Tremblay than Larson even though she was the one who garnered all the awards attention. With all the focus on Tremblay though, several plot points feel undernourished; an impending trial, having to eventually tell Trembley who his father is, and acceptance of Trembley into the family are all issues that are mentioned once or twice and then later forgotten. Some have complained that the film runs too long but the ending comes as abrupt if anything with so many avenues left open. The uncertainty is arguably fitting though, and with two very solid lead performances, this is a hard film to look away from, but its resonance will vary depending upon how one feels about all the issues and ideas here that are unexplored to make room for its depiction of a boy seeing the world for the first time.",Null,3,6,25 February 2017
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," 21st Century Secret Living
","Based on the same short story as the 1947 Danny Kaye film of the same title, this is a vastly different big screen adaptation, updated for the twenty-first century with a basic story that is more grounded in reality. The film begins on a similar note to the 1947 incarnation with Mitty (played here by Ben Stiller) tripping in and out of fantasy and reality, however, whereas Kaye in the 1947 version gradually found himself involved in a real life conspiracy more fantastical than any of his daydreams, Stiller finds himself on a more humdrum quest to track down a photographer and a missing negative here. This narrative deflection leads to the Stiller version being less funny (the 1947 film derives much humour from nobody believing Kaye about the elaborate conspiracy). The most disappointing element of the 2013 film though is how Mitty's fantasies so quickly take a backseat to reality in line with a positive thinking and 'living life to its fullest' message. Mitty's fantasies are not valued here, whereas in the earlier film they are what makes him so good at his job in the first place. Comparisons aside though, the 2013 film is not half-bad for what it is (though at two hours it feels incredibly long). Stiller makes for an excellent milquetoast Mitty, the vistas on display are breathtaking, and Mitty's office building, full of blue hues, is an incredible feat of art direction. The film also has some nice, offbeat moments too (Stiller realising just how large certain beer mugs are) in the parts where the filmmakers do not try too hard to be funny, touching or sentimental.",Null,1,1,21 March 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'a good-looking creation albeit not much else'
","The second part of the movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, this is a good-looking creation albeit not much else. It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects.",Null,13,26,14 January 2005
Schindler's List," My brief review of the film
","The most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an epic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age.",Null,222,441,8 January 2005
The Incredibles," My brief review of the film
","In a time when superheroes are the big thing, an animated film like this was sure to gain popularity, and it did. The film is full of action, with many superbly crafted explosive sequences, but yet the film is tame enough to be entertaining viewing for the whole family. However, that is all that the film basically is: amusing action sequences combined with some excellent animation. The characters are never more than run-of-the-mill stereotypes, with the screenplay never rising really above the ordinary, except for a full good jokes. Still, it is all quite watchable, and some of the non-action sequences, such as the driving on roads and newspaper footage, had me very impressed. It is a visual marvel - and the Oscar winning sound effects are good too. But is it anything more? Well, I guess that is up to the individual to decide.",Null,0,0,5 June 2005
I Am Legend," Last Man Standing
","Inspired by the same source material as 'The Last Man on Earth' and 'The Omega Man', this third big screen adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel sits somewhere between its predecessors in quality. The positives include graphic special effects, a touching relationship between the protagonist and his dog, which he has come to see as a surrogate child in lieu of his own deceased one, and some genuinely creepy moments (following his dog into a dark building). The film also provides an impressive portrait of a desolate metropolis in ruins, with overgrown grass and escaped zoo animals wandering the streets. There is additionally quite a bit to like in how much time elapses (around half an hour) before we even glimpse the zombie/vampire creatures. The second half of the film is nowhere near as effective as the build-up to it though. There are some particular dull moments as two new characters are introduced that allow the protagonist to reflect on his existence. His flashbacks are also less haunting here than those in 'The Last Man on Earth' and the film abandons the memorable ending of the 60s version for something far more sentimental if not necessarily upbeat. All things considered though, Will Smith is quite effective in the lead role, and it would have been interesting to see an entire film dedicated to his friendship with his canine companion.",Null,1,2,7 October 2017
Dog Day Afternoon," My brief review of the film
","An intensely realistic crime drama, the at times shaky camera-work suits the project perfectly, Al Pacino is believable in the lead, and John Cazale shines as his partner in the heist. There is an ambiguity over just what is motivating Cazale's character, and this makes him a very interesting element. In contrast, the film explores the character played by Pacino quite well, so that one can understand and sympathise with his motivations. Both are therefore interesting elements. Another factor of interest is the contrasts in intensity that Lumet sets up. Outside the bank it is heated and intense while inside it is generally cool and calm. The film touches on many different ideas, such as trauma for Vietnam vets, police tactics, the media and homosexuality, but unfortunately none of these are explored too well, which leaves the film with little to say. Still, it is generally gripping, or at least until towards the end when it starts to become repetitive, too talkative and at times too much like a shouting match in which one can easily tune out. Maybe the two-hour length is the problem? It is slightly more than what is needed by the film to get through the material. But even if it is flawed, this is still something quite remarkable, and one of the best from 1975.",Null,4,7,4 October 2005
Amadeus," My brief review of the film
","A lavish, highly enjoyable production, the film is one of the finest biopics ever made, not just because of excellent production values, or the mystery element about the title person's death, but because it brings more to the depicted section of Mozart's life than just that. The film brings up and dives into deep religious issues and how important such religious beliefs were in the eighteenth century, and also it brings up some ideas about the profane mixed with the sacred. The whole production is wonderfully set to classical music, and it is technically superb in every area, with very good costumes and editing, as well as some fine acting, particularly from by Jeffrey Jones, who is as delightful as ever as Emperor Joseph. Nevertheless the film feels a bit lively in excess at times, and it never quite feels like it is in Vienna with the mixed accents, but still it is a quite a stunning achievement and simply superb entertainment. The film deservedly won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture. A director's cut of the film was released too, running an extra twenty minutes at no detriment to the film.",Null,15,22,16 February 2005

It is able to shock, surprise, and make one think, and David Fincher shows that he has a sure hand when it comes to creating just the right atmosphere. As long as one can suspend one's disbelief for a couple of hours, the film is a thrilling ride, full of twists, turns and interesting tricks. It is all about tricking the viewer and less about exploring the drone life of a millionaire, but it does touch on such issues, and even if does not deeply examine them, there is enough in thrills, chills and style to keep one watching.",Null,0,1,9 March 2005
Kick-Ass," Superheros minus the superpowers
","Fed up with the complacency of everyone around him towards spiraling crime, a teenager decides to become a superhero in this well-paced mix of comedy and action from 'Kingsman' director Matthew Vaughn. Long before winning a Golden Globe for his scary performance in 'Nocturnal Animals', Aaron Taylor-Johnson is well cast as the near polar opposite protagonist who narrates his adventures with wit and fun pop culture references. The film also takes a surprisingly down-to-earth approach towards his quest as he only ends up being as effective as a superhero without skills, training, weaponry and powers would be. This down-to- earth air sadly evaporates as Nicolas Cage and Chloë Grace Moretz enter the picture as father and daughter trained superheroes. Both Cage and Moretz are a lot of fun to watch though with great banter and repartee and therefore it is hard to resent these less realistic characters coming into focus. Moretz steals every scene that she is in and while some blaring songs subtract from the immediacy of her combat scenes, she makes for a convincingly dangerous character despite her sweet looks. Much of the action here might be over-the-top, but with the comedic potential of the action so deliberately pronounced, it is easy to sit back and enjoy this speculative take on what might happen if more ordinary citizens chose to fight back.",Null,0,0,25 September 2017
The Man Who Would Be King," My brief review of the film
","An adventure film complete with exciting bits, comic relief, but also a fair share of shortcomings, the final 45 minutes or so of the production help it to rise above the norm, with thought-provoking ideas about the characters, the motivations they have, and religion as a way of life. The balance of the film - the first hour and a bit - is nowhere near as solid as this end section. The tone is uneven, Caine's slipping accent is very noticeable and it feels totally implausible. The characters' motivations are also hard to decipher in the first half of the film, and at times it is just plain difficult to understand what exactly is happening. Still, there is a good general feel for Indian and other cultures, thanks in part to great costumes and sets. The overall picture is the best thing for one to judge, and overall there are many good aspects about this production. It is not quite the masterpiece that some claim it to be, but is solid viewing nonetheless.",Null,3,10,26 September 2005

","There are many interesting ideas in this classic war drama, such as companionship and duty, and they are explored very well, plus the film gives an insight into life in POW camps. It is very well photographed and for the bulk of the duration is quite realistic, however the film's editing fails to provide a continuous flow of action at times. The editing is not really too good, with cuts between changes in action and music that make the editing obvious. There is little else to complain about in the film. Sure, it does not have the same power today as it would have had during the 1930s, and the acting is hardly better than adequate, but it is still very well made. Some plot points are initially ill explained, but by the end everything makes good sense and the film's ending is very effective. It is also interesting how language is used in the film - to show a uniting force that can exist between otherwise opposed people.",Null,3,7,21 November 2005
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," My brief review of the film
","An early Miyazaki film, this is actually one rather different to most of his later works, which tend to feature simple characters and rather simplistic story lines. However the simplicity is part of the charm of his later works, though that is not to say that complexity is bad per se. In this case, it could however be. I cannot speak for the Japanese version, but the English dub of the film makes it seem verbose in nature with an overly complicated plot. Some of the dialogue is just terrible, especially the narration by the protagonist that simply feels unnatural. Then again, this may only be in the Disney version. The animation is great, and the memory sequences are particularly well done. There is a distinct atmosphere of the post-apocalyptic, and this causes it to be intriguing. The editing is however awkward at times, the violence is somewhat overplayed, and the main characters are not built up as well as in some of Miyazaki's future films. This is a certainly a film worth giving a go, with some wonderful music as usual and a few fascinating ideas. It is not the best place to start with films by its director though. For that, I would recommend 'Laputa' or 'Spirited Away'.",Null,0,4,25 October 2005
Hidden Figures," Space Race and Racism
","Employed by NASA in the 1960s, three African American women overcome racial prejudice to excel in their respective areas in this film from 'St. Vincent' director Theodore Melfi. As per 'St. Vincent', Melfi blends comedy and drama together to tell his tale, though this is a more sobering affair with several scenes that highlight how prevalent racial prejudice was back then. Unfortunately, most of the best moments dealing with this made in into the film's theatrical trailer, and while there is something curious in how NASA has to overcome backwards prejudices to advance forward in the space race, it is hard not to wish for the film to focus more on the space race and less on racism. The film additionally feels rather unbalanced by giving Taraji P. Henson twice as much screen time as both her co-stars. Henson admittedly has the best character and delivers the most rounded performance, but the achievements of her peers are diminished by making her such a prominent figure. And yet, if hardly the most amazing true-story drama of recent time, the film is very watchable throughout thanks to solid performances by all concerned and an excellent mix of music with input from Pharrell Williams. Sure, the music is not true to the era but it adds a lot of bounce to what is otherwise fairly routine stuff as far as feel-good biographical dramas go.",Null,0,0,11 August 2017
Sing Street," Riddle of The Singer
","Hoping to impress a girl, a 1980s teen starts a band and awakens a genuine passion for music beyond meeting girls in this amiable drama from Ireland. The chemistry between the protagonist and his friends feels real, the sourced song soundtrack is top notch and the band come up with several memorable 80s-style tunes of their own. The film's best aspect though is how it taps into the rising popularity of music videos in the mid-1980s with a superb analysis of Duran Duran's 'Rio' clip, plus an awesome segment in which the friends film a video clip of their own ('The Riddle of the Model') and absolutely nail it right down to the long flowing costumes. What exists here beyond the basic story of a bunch of friends and their love of music is somewhat less interesting. There are standard bullies, nasty teachers who abuse their powers and our hero has a rather humdrum dysfunctional home life. Unremarkable as these aspects of the film may be, the film still stacks up quite well overall since the music is so often in focus. There is also a delightful portion of the film heavily influenced by the prom sequence in 'Back to the Future', and while the protagonist's strained relationship with his parents does not resonate too much, he has some great moments alone with his college dropout older brother who rues the fact that he was the first born and had to suffer their unstable home life for longer.",Null,2,3,16 May 2017

","A powerful boxing film, it is such a good watch because it goes much deeper than just being about boxing. It is very deeply involving and gripping, and it is likely to even encapsulate viewers not interested in the sport. Swank is excellent but it is the acting from Eastwood that stands out the most, full of realistic emotion in this gritty, authentic tale he has filmed. The film nevertheless is imperfect, outstaying its welcome, having a few medical flaws and some real weaknesses in the plot. It is perfect viewing otherwise however and such a potent experience too insomuch that the flaws of the film do not detract very much. It is just a shame that this film cannot be discussed much further without telling how it ends. It deserves to be talked about.",Null,6,9,30 January 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," My brief review of the film
","More auspicious than his first directing effort, George Clooney has directed what is definitely a good film here. The visual side is excellent, with the feel of both a documentary and noir combined into one. While the technical aspects are great, it is a bit shy of being a brilliant film. There is little to complain about as such, except for the inclusion of a subplot with two supporting characters that is meant to be symbolism of McCarthyism, but it is too obvious to work, and is awkwardly fitted into the storyline. The main problem with the film is that it lacks in complexity. It portrays the important events but it does not dare to deeply explore them. Murrow is not explored in much depth as a person either. There is no emotional involvement to be had - it is not much different from reading a history book. Sure, the film tries to say some things about television and the power of mass media, but the ideas are delivered more so as lessons than as subtle and effective messages. So, some parts of the film do not quite work, but it is a fine production overall. If not quite brilliant, the performances are competent and the sound recording and soundtrack music help in establishing atmosphere. It is a well-done film, but when push comes to shove, it had the potential to be more than just a good film. It is certainly worth seeing though, if for nothing else than to see what Clooney is capable of as a director.",Null,6,10,23 December 2005
Mulholland Drive," My brief review of the film
","In a time when many were unhappy with films being too straightforward, David Lynch created this film that is the exact opposite. The film never delivers a straight answer in the end, and although there is a lot to appreciate in the film, it left me too unsatisfied to fully like it. There have been many extensive reviews written about the clues that Lynch offers to the mystery, but those are such which would be better picked up on watching the film again. It is likely to satisfy more on a second time, however is that how a film is meant to be? An excellent film can become better on repeat viewings, but it should be satisfying the first time round too. However, as aforementioned, there is still a lot that can be appreciated in the film without a full understanding. It is a very intriguing film, generally technically well made, stylish and with a good score. But the lack of a linear plot made it rather grim for me. One can surely appreciate it even if one has to look up the answer to understand, but without reaching a happy medium between too straightforward and not straightforward enough, this is not an easy film to admire and like.",Null,0,1,9 January 2005
Dumb and Dumber," Dumb Happens
","Hoping to return an abandoned briefcase to a beautiful woman he drove to the airport, a limousine driver takes his best friend on a cross country trip, unaware that he is being pursued by angry kidnappers in this comedy starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. As per the title, the running gag is that the friends are incredibly stupid - and oblivious to the fact that the briefcase contains a hefty ransom. The film gets its best laughs from the kidnappers coming to believe that the pair are highly trained assassins and criminal masterminds; their ignorance towards being pursued is also often funny with the pair leaving a note to the 'gas man', which the kidnappers think is written to them and so on. What does not work so well are the simple scenes of the pair acting stupid. From blowing their noses on $100 bills to getting their tongues stuck on cold surfaces, it is all pretty groan-inducing stuff. There is an overabundance of toilet humour too (the cop taking a drink scene is very funny though). Daniels also gets far better laughs than Carrey. The way Daniels manages to keep a straight face while saying things like his pet bird's 'head fell off' is far more amusing than Carrey's excessive mugging. Thorns and all though, this is entertaining stuff while it lasts. The gags may vary in effectiveness but the leads are always vibrant and full of energy with a very genuine chemistry between them.",Null,1,3,14 November 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," We Are Groot
","An alliance uneasily develops between five diverse individuals, each after the same valuable orb, in this action-packed science fiction film. It turns out that the orb in question has the power to destroy entire universes, and while the protagonists are initially motivated by greed, willing to sell to the highest bidder, they gradually become the responsible heroes of the title as they instead try to keep the orb out of evil hands. With little explanation of how the orb works, it becomes little more than a Hitchcockian McGuffin, and with a truckload of explosive action sequences towards the end, the film often seems more interested in being a spectacle to look at than spinning a decent yarn. That said, the characters here are surprisingly three dimensional with the film getting most of its zest from how well they interact with each other. Chris Pratt is especially good as the wisecracking Earthling among them with a fondness for 1970s and 80s music, though the best moments are had by a talking raccoon and tree, both genetically modified to the point of being sentient. The film is a little dry in the moments when neither Pratt nor the raccoon nor the tree are on screen, but as they are present in over 90% of the movie, it is an enthralling ride overall even when the action becomes a tad mindless towards the end. The sci-fi content may not be great here, but the humour frequently works, and with such delightfully offbeat characters, it is easy to see why this hit the right note with many filmgoers when it was first released.",Null,0,2,17 March 2017
The Imitation Game," The Incredible Machine
","Cracking the Nazi Enigma machine takes a toll on mathematician Alan Turing in this biographical drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Far from a traditional biopic, the film transitions between Turing's childhood, his World War II days and the 1950s in which he was investigated on charges of homosexuality (a crime in the UK at the time). Some of the transitions are a little jarring, but in general, the film flows well, giving quite an insight into the way Turing's arguably autistic mind worked. One of the best elements of the film is how Turing's code cracking days help the socially awkward man learn how to function in the world, discovering that if he is nice to others, they will want to assist him and so forth. There is something quite sad to his tale; not just because he was persecuted for being gay and never recognised as a war hero, but because his social awkwardness was never properly treated. This is, however, ultimately an inspiring and uplifting tale, with Cumberbatch's boyish excitement when he realises that he has finally figured how to crack the code coming off just as intense as his sadder moments. Alexandre Desplat's score with sounds similar to computer dings is a nice touch too, and while the script may take some historical liberties, it nevertheless provides a fascinating look at the success of a social misfit and the society that refused to accept him.",Null,0,0,24 April 2017
The Last Emperor," My brief review of the film
","A well done and fascinating, but long and poorly explained biopic - compressing sixty years of history and politics into two and a half hours will be at least a bit overwhelming for a viewer who is not familiar with the topic to understand. However, in terms of art direction, costumes and acting the film is definitely fine. Lone is entirely convincing at the title person from young adulthood to old age, and O'Toole is good as his tutor. But the overarching problem with the film is that all this history is presented without much explanation making the film a far from satisfying watch, even if one with many cinematic virtues.",Null,13,21,10 January 2005
Paranormal Activity," It Comes at Night
","Convinced that paranormal things occur in her bedroom at night, a young woman asks her boyfriend to video record her while she sleeps, which leads to some surprising revelations in this found footage style horror movie. While very few of the jump scares and off-screen sound effects are unsettling, 'Paranormal Activity' certainly has some creepy moments as the young woman wakes up in the middle of the night and stands in a trance besides her bed for minutes on end. The film also successfully plays up the unpredictability of the scenario with a slowing down time lapse counter eerily indicating that something weird is about to occur. Promising as all this might sound, 'Paranormal Activity' is a total miss in its non-nighttime scenes. Neither main character is particularly interesting with the film varying between slow-moving and simply dull as the couple discuss what to do for minutes on end and as the boyfriend often seems to be having more fun experimenting with his cameras and getting out a Ouija board than anything else. A surprise hit when first released though, 'Paranormal Activity' may, however, benefit from being watched with limited preconceptions.",Null,0,0,3 November 2017
The Hangover Part II," The Forgotten
","More of a remake of the first 'Hangover' movie than a sequel to it, this second entry finds the friends with short term memory loss and a bad hangover again after yet another bachelor party. The setting is different though, and with the action taking place in Bangkok, there is something fresh to the friends having to contend with unfamiliar territory and locals who do not speak their language in a quest to piece together what they have forgotten. There are also some fun references to the first movie, like Stu instantly thinking 'the roof!', however, with the basics of the plot so strikingly resembling the first movie (a missing friend, an animal in the room, something with Stu's face and the list goes on), it is hard to blame the characters complaining that they 'can't believe this happening again' way too many times. And yet, while a pale imitation of its predecessor, there are certainly some funny moments to be had with lots of outlandish surprise revelations and charismatic new supporting characters like Nick Cassavetes as a blunt tattoo artist and the ever-reliable Paul Giamatti, in addition to several of Part One's more memorable characters making appearances. The film might not have much new to offer in the marriage and/or relationship message department, but for a few laughs, it is hard to go wrong with the lead actors here, recycled as the basic story may well be.",Null,0,0,19 April 2017
Hotel Transylvania," Grand Hotel
","Set in a world in which monsters fear the wrath of human beings, Count Dracula runs a refuge and has to hide the fact that his latest guest is really a lost human backpacker this animated comedy. While never short on imagination, the film begins poorly with lame flatulence and urination gags as well as silly wordplay with terms like 'holy rabies' and 'scream cheese'. The humour does not really improve as the movie progresses either (fingers stuck up noses), but the main characters become well developed and likable, especially the backpacker - an avid horror fan who enjoys interacting with the monsters with a natural curiosity, sticking his hands into skeletons and so forth. Some of the backdrop gags work well too (the backpacker beaten up by an invisible knight) and there is a great sequence towards the end where the monsters come across a town in which they are celebrated as horror legends rather than feared. The film does, however, also become more sentimental as it progresses, especially as Dracula's daughter predictability falls in love, but the overall product is more enjoyable than one might expect from the barrage of toilet humour and groan-inducing wordplay puns early on.",Null,1,1,27 October 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," My brief review of the film
","A whimsical, often spectacular view of a future in which advances in technology dominate the world. It is well shot and although slow-moving it is intense and enjoyable throughout. The featuring of classical music to establish atmosphere works brilliantly; it provides a feeling of awe, mystery and intrigue  the same aura that Walt Disney worked in creating 'Fantasia'. The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology. Aside from the technical pluses of the film, it stands strong as it is one of not many films out there that has something important to say about humankind, and where the human race is heading in terms of our increasing reliance on machines and our unquenchable thirst to discover. Despite an ending that is hard to understand, it is even harder to overlook this film a true cinema classic.",Null,184,312,3 January 2005
Toy Story," Falling with Style
","In a world in which toys talk and move whenever humans are not looking, a cowboy doll experiences jealousy for the very first time after an action figure replaces him as his owner's favourite toy in this popular animated comedy. The premise lends itself to a number of perplexing unanswered questions (in particular, regarding the 'rules' that the toys follow to freeze as soon as there is the possibility of a human seeing them move) but if one accepts the basic notion and runs with it, the film offers a surprisingly compelling story with striking personal identity themes as both of the main toys come to realise that they are not as special as they once thought. For Woody, it comes with realising that his owner can have other favourite toys and for Buzz it comes from awakening to the fact that he actually is a toy and not the famous space commander that he is designed as being. The film is blessed by excellent animation effects too; while many entirely computer generated animated films have come out in the years since, few have used the process quite so delightfully with lots of mobile tracking and panning shots that would have been near impossible to get right in a live action feature. The changing facial reactions on the toys (especially Woody) are impressive too - even if the fact that the toys in the film look more realistic than the humans in the film never quite feels right. This is, of course, a film about the toys though, and fanciful as the premise may well be, there is a lot to like about their loyalty both towards their owners and each other.",Null,0,0,17 February 2017
The Graduate," My brief review of the film
","It is easy to see why Mike Nichols won the Best Director Oscar for this film. It is very well directed with some shots brilliantly set up in terms of the spatial relations between characters. But, despite being well directed, this is a far from perfect overall film. The final quarter is very poorly put together. The second 'romance' is hardly ever developed, and towards the end it all spirals out frantically and messily into predictable territory. The film is also hurt by its soundtrack. The songs are nice but are played far too often, and when played, they are played in excess. One particular sequences stands out where Hoffman is going about his daily business while on the soundtrack a song is heard. The song plays for its full duration, then ends, and then another song begins. It just shows a too heavily reliance on external material. The photography is also uncomfortably close up at times, and all adult characters are quite two-dimensional. In spite of its problems, the film still comes through. It has some very well edited sequences, both Hoffman and Bancroft have a number of fine moments, and Nichols is great in the director's chair. This one of best films that I have seen from 1967; it simply just is not a flawless classic.",Null,1,3,5 July 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," My brief review of the film
","An interesting but far too complex film, which although full of many good ideas, does not execute them well. The subject matter would best befit a short science fiction story, and indeed the content of the film is so slim that it quite noticeably outstays its welcome. Like most short stories, the film would have best been told from a first person point of view only. The film threads in the story of the operators, just not just the operated too, however. This causes the film to become distracted from the more interesting part of the tale, and as a result, it is at times quite bland. It is not that the viewer does not understand  there is just no reason to care. All that said and done, the film certainly has interesting elements, and it will keep one watching for at least three quarters of its duration. It is not really a poor film; it is above average, but I feel it could have been done a lot better.",Null,3,8,13 January 2005
Taken," Take Care
","When his daughter is kidnapped abroad, an ex-CIA agent goes to extreme lengths to locate her in this fast-paced, non-stop thrill ride whose box office success turned Liam Neeson into an action star. Neeson is indeed very good, conveying heartfelt passion and longing for his child, and much of the film's success is due to his commanding performance. The screenplay is certainly less spectacular, full of so many absurd improbabilities and timing coincidences that any sense of realism soon evaporates. There is also something quite ham-fisted in how Neeson spends the entire first twenty minutes worrying that something will happen to his daughter overseas. At first, he seems paranoid, but then the film confirms his every suspicion, in turn implying that all foreign places are really lurking with danger. Clunky and xenophobic as all this is though, even more vexing is the body count. With many men killed in Neeson's quest, it is hard not to question whether the end justifies the means. Neeson even kills three or four men purely out of anger. If they were standing in his way, it might be one thing, but Neeson's strategy of obtaining information, then mercilessly killing, comes off as a major character flaw that the filmmakers sadly have little interest in exploring. Deeply flawed as the film may be, it is still enormously entertaining - even upon second viewing when one knows exactly what to expect. The action scenes are very well spliced together and a sense of danger sublimely lingers in the air throughout. As invincible as Neeson seems, he also always seems utterly vulnerable, and the fact that he is much too old for the role actually works to his advantage.",Null,0,0,19 June 2016
This Is Spinal Tap," Talented on stage; crazy off stage
","Filmed in documentary style, this fiction film chronicles the ups and downs on a rock band on tour with a penchant for outrageousness. The songs are highly memorable throughout (especially 'Big Bottom' and 'Stonehenge') and kooky touches include a party in which all the waiters are mimes and, of course, the amplifier that goes up to 11. This is not, however, the easiest film to get through. Innovative as Rob Reiner's choice to shoot the film as a mockumentary no doubt is, the content soon grows repetitive with the band members saying one dumb thing after another, whether it be professing that spontaneous combustion in humans exists or stating that the insides of a human body look green and blue. Much better dark humour comes in the form of a running gag in which it is gradually revealed that dozens of drummers in the band have died in mysterious circumstances over the years, with the band's current drummer claiming that 'the law of averages' should keep him safe (!) - and yet, the focus here is always on the ridiculous things the band members say and the misfortunes they experience along the way. Along such lines, the film pokes sharply at the notion that talent and intelligence are not always aligned in life, but whether this dynamic is enough to sustain the film is debatable. Certainly, the film has a hardy fan-base with some regarding it as one of the funniest films ever made, and as it is often said, comedy is the most subjective genre out there. This is a worthwhile movie, but probably best appreciated by those keenly interested in rock music.",Null,0,1,4 February 2017
Toy Story 2," Falling with Style Part 2
","When Woody is stolen by an avid toy collector, the other toys in Andy's room hatch a plan to rescue him in this ambitious sequel that takes the toys out of their comfort zone, exposing them to the world at large. Their interactions on the outside are certainly quite funny, causing road accidents and chaos by driving toy cars through a toy store, however, the best aspect of the film is how it furthers the personal identity themes of the first film. Both Woody and Buzz are provided with detailed back stories for their design and Woody has to wrestle with whether to join the toys from the set that he originally came from while Buzz finds himself up against another of him who likewise believes that he is a real spaceman and not a toy. Often cited as the weakest of the first three 'Toy Story' movies, 'Toy Story 2' is certainly a little too sentimental for its own good (Jessie's flashback drags on for too long) and not all the jokes work, but it remains fairly engaging to view, even with the novelty aspect of the first movie not the same. The toy characters are simply fun and interesting to follow around, often displaying surprising ingenuity while on their rescue mission. The film additionally touches on some interesting issues not covered in the first movie, such as the vulnerability of toys when being played with and the sense of loss when owners grow up and move on. No, the magic might not quite be the same here as in the 'falling with style' original, but it is great to come across a sequel that at least tries to take the material in a different direction.",Null,0,0,24 February 2017
Victory," High Stakes Soccer
","'Victory' - sometimes known as 'Escape to Victory' - the plot of this sports drama has Nazi officers challenge their POWs to a soccer match for propaganda purposes; conflict comes as the Allied players find themselves torn between training for the game and plotting a daring escape during the game. The film is nicely shot by Gerry Fischer, with some excellent gliding nighttime shots, and the performances are very decent, especially those of co-stars Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine with all the US versus UK contempt and animosity between them. The rest of the characters are highly interchangeable though with the film's energy coming to a near standstill in the scenes without Caine or Stallone. The basic story is also feels incredibly unrealistic, especially with the Nazis never really seeming to consider to wide opportunities for escape that they are granting the POWs. With enough suspension of disbelief though, the film can be enjoyed. A neat touch is how initially Caine never seems interested in anything but the soccer match and initially Stallone never seems interested in anything other than escaping, but as the film plods along the pair begin to see a little more eye-to-eye. 'Victory' is not quite as potent as 'Stalag 17', 'The Great Escape', 'Danger Within' and other POW escape films since the soccer game plays a very large focus, but it is refreshingly different for sure.",Null,0,0,27 June 2017
Frank," Almost Famous
","Untalented as a songwriter but nevertheless set on making it as a musician, a young Irishman quits his day job to join an eccentric band whose lead singer dons a papier-mâché mask that he never removes in this offbeat drama. Domhnall Gleeson is fine as the milquetoast young protagonist who becomes more and more of an authoritative voice in the band and Michael Fassbender has some solid moments in a mostly voice-only performance as the singer; his observation about normal human faces being a little strange themselves certainly resonates. The talents of the two leads are, however, hardly maximised here. Stories about the rise and falls of bands are a dime a dozen and 'Frank' does little to distinguish itself other than the mask, which soon becomes more of an annoying gimmick than delightful quirk as it distracts from Gleeson's character growth. The music is hardly great either, though the film's weakest area is its supporting characters; it is hard to feel for the band's highs and lows when we only get to know two of them in depth. Then there is the love-hate relationship between Gleeson and Maggie Gyllenhaal which never rings true. Having Gleeson constant tweet about his experiences with his tweets appearing over the action is a further jarring touch that subtracts from the immediacy of the action. Director Lenny Abrahamson would of course later go on to score an Oscar nomination for directing 'Room'. This earlier effort is a strikingly different sort of motion picture at least and may be of interest to those retrospectively exploring his filmmaking origins.",Null,0,0,22 March 2017
Life Is Beautiful," Dolce Vita
","'La Vita è Bella' - better known as 'Life is Beautiful' - this Roberto Benigni movie focuses on a free-spirited Italian Jew who pretends for his son that being sent to a concentration camp is part of an elaborate game. One's mileage with the film will vary based on whether one views him lying to his son as benevolent or utterly irresponsible; certainly, the film celebrates his efforts to shelter his son, but he also often places the boy in danger by not letting him know how serious everything is. The film is hampered by a roundabout structure with 45 minutes of childish pranks by the protagonist as he romances his wife to-be before his son is born. Things admittedly pick up well once the son enters the picture, but with slapstick gags beforehand including splattered eggs, it is certainly a bumpy ride. That said, there is a lot of cleverness in how the protagonist manipulates every situation (especially mistranslating a stern guard) in order to convince his son that it is all one big game. There are some very tense moments too, such as when his son accidentally says thank-you. A lot of suspension of disbelief is required though given how many shenanigans they get away with (sneaking off at will; using the concentration camp PA) and therefore it is hard to consider the film very realistic. It does admittedly resonate somewhat though as a tale of fatherly devotion and trying to make the best of bad situation.",Null,1,4,4 April 2017
A Clockwork Orange," My brief review of the film
","A disturbing but yet very beautiful piece of film-making, Kubrick has created the ultimate study of mind manipulation in this film. It is a protest against reform programs that take away freedom of a choice, and the message of the film in terms of paying for one's sins in all eternity is inescapable, evident to a large extent in the sardonic nature of the tale. Although set in the future, it hardly feels like it is, this being because the message of the film is overwhelmingly powerful and capable of applying to any age. The film has a number of possible hidden meanings to it  a feat equaled on scale only by Kubrick's former film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Besides for the meaning behind the film, there are still the marks of a masterpiece. Kubrick's direction is superb alongside the good photography, capturing shadows and angles needed to establish tone. The editing is excellent too, done in a flashy, brainwashing style at times to have relevance to the film. The choice of cast is again inspirational, however the film achieves the most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliest forms of art, classical music, and give it an unforgettable style and importance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to explain what is so great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe best explained by watching the film itself.",Null,189,280,3 January 2005
From Hell," Don't Know Jack
","Hoping to uncover the motives of Jack the Ripper, a London policeman enlists the help of a prostitute of this fanciful take on the historical murderer whose identity remains a mystery still today. The film is atmospherically shot by the reliable Peter Deming and there are some neat stylistic touches such as time lapse night to day sequence as the police discover one victim's body. Generally speaking though, this is a bit of a lacklustre affair. The film's explanation of the Ripper murders as a part of an elaborate conspiracy to hush local prostitutes never quite rings true. It is almost fascinatingly twisted enough for the lack of credibility not to matter, however, the fact that Johnny Depp's protagonist uncovers the conspiracy through clairvoyance and intuition rather than actual detective work makes it hard to buy into. Imagine if Kevin Costner's character in 'JFK' used his dreams to argue against Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone and you would not be far off. The film is additionally cheapened by a romance developing between Depp and Heather Graham, cast as the prostitute who helps him. Not only does their romance do little to further the tale, the pair have few sparks between them, with each balancing Victorian accents not helping matters in the slightest. Small moments of 'From Hell' certainly work, such as Joseph Merrick making an unexpected appearance and the coins on the eyes myth, but as far as Jack the Ripper stories are concerned, 'Time After Time' and 'Murder by Decree' are far preferable motion pictures.",Null,0,0,25 March 2017
Reservoir Dogs," Dogfight
","Suspicion and paranoia overwhelm a band of criminals after a tightly plotted heist goes sour in this feature film debut from Quentin Tarantino. The film is built on an interesting dynamic with none of the robbers actually knowing one another since they were all hired by a third party, given code names and were told to not tell each other their true identity. How much can they really trust each other's word and could one of them be a police informant? Intriguing as all this might sound, one's mileage with the movie is almost certain to vary depending on one's tolerance of the dialogue-heavy script. While some of the violence is quite brutal, there is precious little of it as the film mostly consists of the characters bantering back and forth, which unfortunately has a tendency to feel repetitive. The imbalanced time spent on each criminal's background feels a little odd too with some of them far more developed than others. All that said and done, the revelation of the police informant's identity is very well done and the second half of the film has many intense moments. The final few scenes are especially memorable with an outcome that resonates in the mind long after the film is over.",Null,1,1,15 November 2017
Love & Mercy," Now and Then
","Titled after his 1988 song, this Brian Wilson biopic depicts two distinct periods in the Beach Boys front man's life: early success in the 1960s and battling psychosis in the 1980s. Events from both timelines overlap each other and in an ambitious move (that recalls 'I'm Not There'), two actors who barely look like each other another play Wilson for the two different time periods, signifying just how different a person he was in the 1980s compared to the 1960s. Well-intentioned as it may be, the technique is a little too distracting to fully work. John Cusack and Golden Globe nominated Paul Dano are both solid as the two Brian Wilsons but their very different appearances only make it all the more jarring when the film switches between them. Some of the switches feel ill-judged too as the film bounces between emotional highs and lows in both time periods. Such issues aside, 'Love & Mercy' is a technically well accomplished movie with nary a boring moment to be had. The sound design - especially accentuated audio from kitchen cutlery in a key scene - is excellent throughout, the detailed recording studio scenes are fascinating and Elizabeth Banks offers a surprisingly multi-layered performance as Wilson's girlfriend in the 1980s storyline. Her silent confrontation with Paul Giamatti towards the end displays more inner strength than words could possibly offer. The film also concludes on a pitch perfect note with the iconic 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' swelling up at just the right moment. By all accounts, the real Brian Wilson was impressed by the film too.",Null,0,0,18 December 2016
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Hedonism always comes at a cost
","'The limit of love is always needing an accomplice' claims one of the four self-proclaimed fascists in this film who kidnap several teenagers to use for their sexual gratification in war-torn Italy. Much has been written about 'Salò' being an allegory for fascism, and the extremes to which the four men take their subjects are shocking even upon revision. What some miss though is that this is equally a film about the four men themselves - four unhappy and once repressed individuals letting their sexual fantasies come to life and living in a hedonistic manner, though not without a cost. The cost is the need for an 'accomplice', and as the camera relishes in the horrified reactions of the victims (rather than their torture; this is NOT an exploitation film), the central dynamic soon becomes suffering for another's joy. The fascists never really want to harm or hurt their subjects; they enjoy cuddling and kissing them, but the gratification that they seek does not provide the same satisfaction to the teenagers. 'Salò' a confronting film and one that is hard to turn away from, with the only misstep being the abrupt ending (apparently Pasolini shot four endings as he was that unsure of how to bring things to a close). The casting is pretty much spot-on. Aldo Valletti as the cross-eyed 'President' and Paolo Bonacelli as the eloquent 'Duke' are especially well cast. Both are so formidable, but also noticeably human beneath it all with their burning desires for gratification. Fascism might be evil, but the fascists here curiously just flawed human beings, drowning in uncontrolled excesses.",Null,2,2,10 December 2015
Don't Breathe," Shut In
","Unemployed and unable to find legitimate work, three young adults take to thievery as a last resort, however, breaking in a blind Vietnam War veteran's house leads to some horrific twists in this home invasion thriller produced by Sam Raimi. From the premise alone, the film sounds a lot like the earlier Adam Schindler movie 'Intruders' (aka 'Shut In') with the notion of the person whose home is being invaded being less helpless than first appears. Along these lines, 'Don't Breathe' seems to up the ante by making the thieves sympathetic; Jane Levy's character in particular has extensive early scenes in which we come to understand how much she and her younger sister not only want but need to move away from home. This dynamic renders the first half of 'Don't Breathe' quite interesting as we are pulled between feeling sorry for the blind war veteran and for the thieves with various incidents causing our sympathies to swing back and forth. The film disappointingly chooses a side around halfway in though as it is revealed that the veteran has a shocking secret in his basement. Not only is the secret implausible, it places us in an awkward position where ethically we have to root for the thieves instead, which just does not sit right. The film certainly has enough in the thrills and chills department that it is entertaining until the end and the pacing is never off. There is also a lot to like in the idea of the war veteran being better equipped than the thieves even without his sight, even if this idea could have perhaps been put to better use.",Null,6,12,16 January 2017
Eyes Wide Shut," My brief review of the film
","A perfectly photographed and superbly directed film about the state of modern marriages and how society is heading, in a world that is becoming increasingly morally decaying. The mystery element of the film provides it with a perfect atmosphere to set up the confused emotions of the main character, and gives the film an intriguing quality. The background music is excellent, and the cast is superb. The emotional state that Tom Cruise is able to bring to his character is totally believable, and film directors Sydney Pollack and Todd Field have interesting supporting roles. The film is nonetheless quite long for the subject matter at hand, but besides for this there is little wrong with the film. Some were repelled by the frequent nudity and sexual content of the film, however without such, this would not be the modern masterpiece it is. Certainly quite a high note for Kubrick to have ended his career on.",Null,8,17,13 January 2005
Pretty Woman," His Fair Lady
","Hired by a rich businessman to be his date for a week, a prostitute has to work out if the businessman is serious about his romantic advances towards her in this romantic comedy that propelled Julia Roberts to fame. A popular movie when first released, 'Pretty Woman' has received some backlash over the years for its lack of realism and indeed one has to suspend disbelief at how kind-hearted both protagonists are. There is enough snappy dialogue though to keep things moving along; 'we both screw people for money' Richard Gere comments at one point, while his observation that 'stores are never nice to people... they're nice to credit cards' offers some unexpected social commentary for a lighthearted film like this is. The other big plus is the talented supporting cast. Hector Elizondo is delightful in a Golden Globe nominated role as a prim and proper hotel proprietor who gradually warms towards Roberts while Jason Alexander is a lot of fun as Gere's cunning lawyer. Realism aside, the biggest issue with the film is how little Roberts changes over the course of the film. This is no 'Pygmalion' or 'My Fair Lady' tale in which we see a noticeable difference in the protagonist as a result of her experiences. Still, it is a pleasant enough movie with some really funny moments (Roberts commenting on an opera) in between the clichés.",Null,0,0,3 December 2017
Some Like It Hot," My brief review of the film
","A delightful cross-dressing comedy, this was one of the first of its type and it still is one of the funniest. It is very cleverly written, impeccably acted, particularly by Joe E. Brown, and features excellent chemistry between the two leads. There are parallels in the film to actual events and attitudes that existed in the 1920s, giving the film a historical insight as an extra virtue. The film works so well not just because of its historical parallels but also because it spoofs gangster films and not just the cross-dressing joke. Overall it is a wonderful film that sparkles along to its glitzy Academy Awarding winning costume design.",Null,24,41,3 January 2005
Inside Man," The Insider
","Two overworked New York detectives try to uncover why four bank robbers who have taken hostages appear to be stalling for time in this unusual heist movie directed by Spike Lee. The amount of thought and detail in the robbers' plan is a constant source of fascination and the film derives a lot of mileage from how the detectives always find themselves one step behind. The mystery at the heart of the film (why they are stalling and what they are really after) is pretty decent too, even if all the cutaways to Christopher Plummer as the owner of the bank spell things out a bit. The film tries to do a bit too much that is daringly different for its own good though. The flashforwards as hostages are interviewed afterwards, for instance, are intriguing but also subtract from the intimacy of the action. They prematurely reveal who survives too. The subplot with Jodie Foster is likewise a mixed blessing. She is easily the most interesting and mysterious character in the piece, however, as the film is primarily about the two detectives and the bank robbers interacting, she likewise breaks some of the tension. Even if is not always edge-of-the-seat gripping though, 'Inside Man' is a film with very few (if any) dull moments. Matthew Libatique (the Oscar nominated DOP of 'Black Swan') does a great job visualising the material together with Lee. From the dark lighting choices, to a vertigo shot on Plummer at his desk, to a tracking shot from Denzel Washington's chest, the film looks great. Terence Blanchard ('25th Hour') also provides another solid music score for Lee.",Null,1,2,8 July 2016
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," My brief review of the film
","While 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' are both generally regarded as good films, ''Empire'' is generally considered to be vastly superior for taking the series in new directions while ''Jedi'' just provided more of the same. I feel that this type of relationship can be applied to this Harry Potter film and the third entry, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. The third film gave a whole new darker and more adult look to the series with a considerable amount of style. This fourth film carries on that style but fails to improve on it; as the director, Mike Newell does not add any touches that are distinctly his own. That's not to say that it is a poor film. It is well made, with excellent makeup, superb interior decoration and special effects that are as impressive as usual, but it is in no way up to the standard of the third film. The new music by Patrick Doyle is quite good also, in the same style as John William's famed composition, but with sensations of its own. The film still does have its flaws, and those who have read the book have also complained about it being the first poor adaptation in the series. It is not too well written either way, with too many love subplots that add up to nothing by the end. The plot also feels rather reduced to just sporting events. Directing-wise, the film often feels too busy, with much of the action looking like it is just for show, and although the cinematography is epic scale and grand, it tends to make the film feel too much like a roller coaster ride. It is yet again reasonably entertaining and engaging to watch, despite its drawbacks and its extreme length. It is full of parts that are amusing and interesting effects. It simply just is not too praiseworthy as a follow-up to the superb 'Harry Potter and the Prison of the Azkaban'.",Null,1,1,21 December 2005
Three Colors: Blue," My brief review of the film
","Carefully directed, with attention to both detail and colour, the film is amazing on a visual scope, but it is also powerful on an emotional scope with a number of very intense and moving scenes. It is a story of coping with grief, with characters fleshed out through facial expressions rather than words and actions, and Binoche is a fine choice for the lead. The intriguing music score and fade-to-black editing provide the film with an interesting sensation, in particular alongside the cinematography and lighting, used cleverly to keep things in and out of focus. Kieslowski also plays with sound in an interesting manner, and it is hard to flaw the film on anything. We are told nothing of the background of our protagonist, the supporting characters at times appear haphazardly thrown around, and yes, there is a lot of meandering and not much story, but this surely depicts the state of mind of the protagonist. Really, it is hard to say anything against this film, as it is so well made and moving that it is really just fine viewing. The first entry in a trilogy of films, it was followed in 1994 by 'Trois Couleurs: Blanc'.",Null,23,33,12 June 2005
Castle in the Sky," My brief review of the film
","Hayao Miyazaki's screenplay here is just excellent. The story is imaginative and at times quite moving, plus there are many funny moments to be had along the way. The characters are however overly silly and only ever lightly developed, but everything else about the script works so well that it easy to forgive its shortcomings. The music is rather charming and the animation itself is great too. Some of the violence does not quite work, but there are so many other scenes that simply radiate with beauty. The running time of over two hours is a bit lengthy, but watching it is by all means time well spent. If not quite the masterpiece that 'Spirited Away' is, this one comes pretty close.",Null,8,10,11 October 2005
The Untouchables," My brief review of the film
","A perfect rendition of events is created in the film, thanks to excellent costumes and art direction, and a very well researched screenplay. Superb music by Ennio Morricone and excellent cinematography provide the film with an exciting epic swoop without ruining its historical credibility. Sean Connery, in a role he won an Oscar for, Kevin Costner, and Robert De Niro, in a brilliant realisation of Al Capone, are all in top form. If being nit-picky one might fault the film in over-glorifying Eliot Ness, but that hardly subtracts from this exciting, excellently filmed experience, which has both style and substance.",Null,41,78,23 January 2005
Zombieland," Survival of the Dead
","Having survived a zombie apocalypse by adhering to a strict set of rules, a timid college student cautiously partners up with a gung-ho fellow survivor and two sisters on the run in this walking dead comedy starring Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson. The film has amassed a considerable following since its initial release, despite never quite being as funny as 'Shaun of the Dead', the film that inspired it, with Harrelson's energetic performance frequently talked about as a highlight. Solid as Harrelson is though, tinkering between down-to-earth and absolute loose cannon, it is Eisenberg's often deadpan performance and witty narration that makes the film work. He has some simply hilarious moments (casually tossing a swig of alcohol out of a car window so Harrelson does not notice) as well as several amusing observations to make about human interaction and the way society functions. The chemistry between all four main players is really good too, with Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin additionally well cast. The film trips up though by letting Eisenberg ramble on too much about love and his unrequited lust for Stone; some very heavy-handed messages about family and relationships overtake the comedy and horror elements towards the end, causing the film to end on a low note. For the most part though, 'Zombieland' is highly watchable. With zombie attacks kept at a minimum (until the climax), the film unexpectedly succeeds best as an uncanny road trip movie with the characters gradually bonding and learning to appreciate each other along the way.",Null,0,0,29 October 2016
Die Hard," My brief review of the film
","A well-made action film with an excellent technical side, the somewhat convoluted plot takes a backseat to the action and thrills, yet the film still delivers its excitement well. The characters are quite run-of-the-mill, including a very typical hero, but at least Alan Rickman manages to bring a bit more to his character: something sly and mysterious. Paul Gleason's character is an annoyance and a waste, but he is fortunately not giving too much screen time. There is too much time though spent on useless supporting characters in general, and the messages about marriage and relationships are too obvious to be effective. Still, if not quite a masterpiece, this is energetic stuff, very good of its type, plus there are some moments of comic relief well worked in.",Null,1,2,23 October 2005
Psycho," My brief review of the film
","One of the most influential films of all time, this is also arguably the best directed film of all time. Hitchcock brought a number of new techniques out in this film, and many clichÃ©s of the thriller genre originate from what was original when this was first released. The amazingly discreet shower scene is one of the best-filmed sequences of all time, put against the chilling music score by Bernard Hermann that haunts the whole film. The acting is also top-notch, especially from Anthony Perkins, who has never had a better role, and most importantly, it is a film that is thoroughly entertaining, even after multiple viewings.",Null,4,7,8 January 2005
The Witch," A Family Torn Apart
","Paranoia tears apart a superstitious and devoutly religious seventeenth century family in this unusual horror movie that debuted to considerable acclaim at Sundance. The film's most striking aspect is the attention to period detail; not only are the sets and costumes authentic, everyone also converses in Old English with appropriate vernacular, which helps to capture the flavour of the times. The film additionally benefits from a superb lead performance by Anya Taylor- Joy as the eldest daughter whose parents and siblings gradually begin to suspect of witchcraft as she undergoes adolescent changes. The less said about the actors playing her siblings the better though and the film's attempts at authenticity are sadly compromised by the washed- out visual approach with so many greys and blues favoured that the style calls attention to itself. The project also narrowly misses the mark for psychological horror. It is, after all, made quite clear that something sinister and malevolent is in the midst, giving little room to question whether it is all in their minds, onset by religious paranoia. That said, there is much to like in the notion that religious fanaticism further drives the family apart and causes them to distrust one another rather than bond together to combat the evil around them. The ending, if a tad overly literal, is highly memorable too and the film certain leaves much to ponder over. 'The VVitch' may not be all that it could have possibly been, but it is quite understandable why it has amassed such a following in this era of highly recycled horror movies.",Null,1,1,22 October 2016
Steve Jobs," Showmanship
","Less a biopic of the computing pioneer and more of a series of snapshots, this Aaron Sorkin scripted film focuses on the title character's anxieties in the minutes leading up to new product launches at three stages of his life. This is an interesting move by Sorkin and director Danny Boyle as we only get to see Jobs when at his most vulnerable, but the effectiveness is debatable. The film is flooded with flashbacks to provide exposition and fill in key details and tension inevitably dissipates with so much cutting back and forth. Sorkin also struggles to get under the title character's skin to reveal a human being. In the title role, Michael Fassbender is cold and distant throughout, proudly stating 'I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me' and cynically commenting that people always 'find a reason to sue me' when asked about contacting his birth father. On this note, the film tries to use the fact that Jobs was adopted as a possible reason for him being so callous but to little effect. His relationship with his estranged daughter is the only really element that humanises him, and even that never quite clicks with their bonding lost in the jumps in time between the three acts. And yet, there remains a lot to like about how the film captures his enthusiasm and showmanship, ruing the fact that movies like '2001' made the public fear computers and practising his product launches time and time again. Daniel Pemberton's pulsating music score is pitch perfect too and it is easy to see why Kate Winslet garnered awards attention, even if her authentic Polish accent sometimes slips.",Null,0,0,22 February 2017
Crazy Heart," The Big Blake
","Frequently compared to 'Tender Mercies', both films feature ageing, alcoholic country singers finding new love and newfound success, however, 'Crazy Heart' spins a noticeably different story. Most notably, the character of Bad Blake (played by Jeff Bridges) in 'Crazy Heart' is still an active singer at the start of the film and one who has zero interest dealing with his alcohol problem. This in turns renders Blake a more interesting character as he has to find it in himself to recognise how much alcohol is ruining his life. He also has a lot more personal growth as he becomes aware that his hedonistic lifestyle is not compatible with his newfound romance. Whatever the case, Bridges shines in the lead role which almost feels tailor-made to his sensibilities; in fact, the very first scene of the film places Bridges at a bar in a bowling alley in an obvious reference to 'The Big Lebowski' - the title character of which has some curious similarities to Blake. There were some questions raised at the time as to whether Bridges deserved to win the Oscar that year or whether it was more of a lifetime achievement award. Viewing the film though, it is hard to imagine how such concerns ever came about as this is easily one of his finest turns. The less said about also Oscar nominated Maggie Gyllenhaal the better though as her romance with Bridges never quite rings true. The film is also set back by the frequency of the musical numbers, which sometimes get in the way of the story developing. That said, the songs ARE that good with Bridges even doing his own singing.",Null,0,1,28 January 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," My brief review of the film
","A powerful anti-war film, which captures both the awful experience of fighting in the war, as well as the disillusionment of those who were persuaded into enlisting. It is a remarkable piece of cinema for its time, with some cinematography that is still impressive by today's standards and high production values. Nevertheless it does feel slightly outdated, and there is a lack of authenticity, with an absence of any reminder that these are the Germans who are featured. Still this barely hurts a film with so much to say. The major flaw of the film is an ineffectual performance by Lew Ayres in the lead, as he is only ever half-convincing. But even if not a flawless film, it is still a remarkable film.",Null,1,4,8 January 2005
30 Days of Night," Day for Night
","Vampires invade a snowbound Alaskan town during a month of complete darkness in this horror movie from 'Hard Candy' director David Slade. It is a pretty nifty idea (where would be a more appropriate place for creatures of the night to feed?) and Slade sets up the movie well with lots of uncertainty in the air before it is made clear that vampires are afoot. Ben Foster is delightfully sinister as a stranger in town who predicts the vampire plague and the icebound vistas appear appropriately ominous. Despite such promise, the film falls apart as it progresses because none of the characters are defined beyond broad stereotypes and none of the actors (Foster aside) have the charisma to render their characters relatable. Setting the film over 30 days is problematic too. It is hard to keep track of time and without scenes set aside to show the characters sleeping, eating, etc., it feels like the whole film has occurred over two or three days - not ten times as many. Most disappointing of all though is the highly repetitive nature of the film. With limited characterisation, everything basically amounts to one vicious attack after another, all of which are filmed in such a frenzied manner that it is impossible to keep track of what is going on. The film does at least recognise the irony of the premise and what one character says early on, 'we live out here for a little freedom', echoes throughout.",Null,0,0,1 October 2016
Sausage Party," Sausage Fest
","Living in blissful ignorance, the food products at a small supermarket consider a revolt after learning that humans buy them to eat them in this animated comedy that purposely pushes the boundaries of good taste (pun intended). While it raises unanswered questions galore, the basic premise is not half-bad and touching on issues of racial intolerance, religion versus atheism and sexual repression, the film even has a couple of good ideas. Most of the intelligence is, however, obscured by the film's penchant for gross-out gags and so much sexual innuendo that one can only wonder the biological purpose of food copulating. The high amount of swearing and obscene language does not feel natural either. With a swear word inserted into almost every line, it often feels as if the filmmakers simply thought that the idea of food swearing was funny in itself. Same goes for the excessive long scenes of the food products getting high. The film is not a total waste though and it is actually rather funny in parts with some very good vocal work. Top credit goes to Edward Norton for a spot-on impersonation of Woody Allen, with David Krumholtz equally as effective in his banter with Norton. There is some neat fourth wall breaking towards the end too if one can make it through without being deterred by the filmmakers trying (often too hard) to be as politically incorrect as possible here.",Null,0,1,25 April 2017
Wedding Crashers," Weddings, Parties, Anything
","Two friends who have turned crashing weddings (to score free food, free booze and loose women) into an art form find their values challenged when invited to spend the weekend with a politician and his unmarried daughters in this jovial comedy starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. The two stars have excellent chemistry together and the film gets off to a great start with many funny moments to be had as they crash an extensive variety of weddings while reciting a charter of over one hundred rules to one another, such as 'Rule #16: Always have an up-to-date family tree' when almost caught out. The fun slows down though when they begin to spend the weekend with the politician. Christopher Walken is solid as always as the community pillar of a man and his family are a nicely eccentric bunch, with Jane Seymour well cast as his cougar wife and Keir O'Donnell delightful as his closeted gay son obsessed with painting. The film tries too hard to have a heart in this section though and subsequently slides into formulaic territory quickly with Wilson winning a girl, losing her through betrayal and then having to win her back. The movie also rather oddly spends more time on Wilson and Vaughn talking about growing up and leaving their wedding crashing days behind than their actual crashing of weddings. It is all a tad too sweet if surely passable as light entertainment.",Null,0,0,7 April 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," My brief review of the film
","A quite well shot, well-acted depiction of extremities under war, and how war affects different people. It manages to portray the setting and the times unforgettably well, aided by some good music. Hayakawa is excellent, giving off a commanding performance as the Japanese general in charge. Despite its merits, the film still does have a number of vices. At times it is difficult to understand what is happening, and the film appears to be deficient in terms of providing the audience with background information. Also, the film is awfully overlong and none of the supporting characters (except for Hayakawa) are well developed. This is nonetheless a film that can be liked for its virtues insomuch as they over-weigh the film's vices  but they do not override the negative aspects of the film. In addition, one may note that it is historically inaccurate  another minor flaw of the film. Nevertheless, it was considered the best film of the year by both the British and American film academies, and it is a good quality film.",Null,4,8,21 January 2005
Downfall," My brief review of the film
","Heavy but generally well made, this film has been marketed as being about Adolf Hitler's final days and his downfall; it is actually more about the downfall of the Nazis on the whole, with Bruno Ganz in very much a supporting role as Hitler. It sounds like a very positive thing that the film explores more than just Hitler's own downfall, however in execution, the film appears far too busy. There is a lot going on to be followed, as the film chases many different plot lines, without any real focus. Also, it is a bit too talkative to be followed at times. It feels drawn out despite all that is going on because suspense and tension is to a degree jarred by the jumping between all the different events. As lengthy as it might seem at two and a half hours long, a three-hour duration could have been a bit more appropriate. Either way, the visual side of the film is perfect for the project, with an appropriately washed out colour scheme, realistic sets and camera-work to match. Ganz is also very good as Hitler, slowly but surely maddening, and it is an amazement to watch whenever he is on screen - which in turn makes it a shame that such moments exist in less than half of the film's running time. Overall, this is a film worth watching for its realistic and harrowing depiction of the downfall of the Nazi stronghold in Germany, and for the work by Bruno Ganz. Otherwise though, it is not a film for everyone, with its large amount content squeezed into two and a half hours - but that does not mean that it is not a good film.",Null,1,3,2 February 2006
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hailing
","Offered a cushy desk job with an aerospace company, a 1950s Hollywood producer wrestles with whether or not to switch career while experiencing the most chaotic day of his life in this lively Coen Brothers comedy. The film is divided into three main problems that the producer, played by Josh Brolin, has to solve. In one, his studio's biggest star, played by George Clooney, is kidnapped by a Communist cell on the set of a biblical epic a la 'The Robe'. In another, a young western star (Alden Ehrenreich) has trouble transitioning to melodrama. In the third, an Esther Williams-like musical icon (Scarlett Johansson) is pregnant but unmarried and cannot tarnish her image. The Clooney and Ehrenreich subplots work best, nicely intertwining near the end and Tilda Swinton is delightful as not one but two (!) reporters looking to write about both actors. Ralph Fiennes is also a lot of fun as the melodrama director. The Johansson subplot does not work quite as well though (despite a magnificently choreographed mermaid-suit number), while an even smaller subplot with Channing Tatum doing a superb Gene Kelly impersonation feels like it should have received more focus. Whatever the case, the film captures the chaos that comes with running a studio, and while the film could have benefited from expanding on how much Brolin loves to fix problems in his producer job, the film certainly shows a level of excitement with filmmaking that simply would not come from an ordinary desk job - and the film could well be interpreted as the Coens' ode to why they keep going in show business.",Null,0,0,28 February 2016
Kingpin," Let's Go Bowling
","Strapped for cash, an injured former bowling champion hatches a cunning plan to coach a talented young man to lucrative tournament success in this lively comedy from the Farrelly Brothers. As per Farrelly norm, the film is littered with crude humour and childish gross-out gags. Also, as per the Farrellys' earlier 'Dumb & Dumber', there are one too many gags at the expense of a main character's naivety. 'Kingpin' is frequently funny throughout though with even some of the cruder puns ('we have a bull') working well. Much of the film's success is due to how likable and empathetic Woody Harrelson is as the bowling champ whose life has gone downhill ever since his arm was severed. It is a character that could have easily been written as pathetic, but on the contrary, he is passionate and imaginative, going to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying the rent and to convince the talented young man (an Amish farmer) to take him on as coach. The film also benefits from Bill Murray at his funniest, some fun movie references ('The Graduate'; 'Indecent Proposal') and the way the story defies generic expectations and ends with loose ends as the fates of certain characters are not actually germane to the plot. And it is quite a warm tale that the film spins beneath its obscenities: a story of not giving up and the belief that all people can change.",Null,0,1,25 November 2017
Ray," My brief review of the film
","A generally well made and well performed biopic, the film is however better than the average such film out there, as it provides an insight not only into Ray Charles' life, but also into music recording, blindness, racism, drug addiction, and the depicted periods in time. The 1950s and 1960s are portrayed very well, with fine costumes and sets, captured well by the director of photography. Paul Hirsch and the editing team give the film a suitably fancy visual style, with different dissolves, wipes and other techniques. The sound recording is by far the film's best element though, and not just because of Foxx's mouthing in time with Ray Charles' dubbed singing. There are also some wonderful bits with sound amplification, to show how deaf persons pick up sound better, and the background noises fit in well throughout. However, it is not a perfect production. From the 90-minute point onwards it all starts to drag, even if it is still rather compelling. The flashbacks could have also been handled a bit better, as sense of time becomes a bit distorted. Still, it is one of the better films of the year, and of course, the acting cannot be forgotten. Foxx won the Oscar for a solid lead performance, but Kerry Washington should not be overlooked, as she has some great emotional moments as Ray's wife. And the music on the film's soundtrack is as great as one would expect.",Null,2,3,2 July 2005
The Good Shepherd," Central Intelligence
","Very loosely based on the life of the CIA Head of Counterintelligence during the 1960s, this drama looks at the early years of the agency and its difficulties with the Bay of Pigs. The structure is quite innovative with the film flipping back and forth between the World War II years and the 1960s as the protagonist, played by Matt Damon, is haunted by memories of past failures after being accused of an intelligence leak. Engaging as all this sounds, the film is oddly hard to get through. The lack of makeup to age Damon is the most obvious vice; the story is impossible to follow at times with it unclear whether certain scenes are taking place in the 1940s or 1960s. Then there is the absence of any passage of time between Damon's son as a preteen and adult (Eddie Redmayne is great in the role though). The film's biggest setback though is the fact that Damon's character is cold, reserved and uncharismatic throughout. With his constant poor choices in life, he becomes an incredibly hard person to like. He is not just flawed but almost without virtue. That said, his extreme willingness to put his work/country ahead of his family is certainly curious and the overall film offers a fascinating portrait of individuals doing morally ambiguous things in the name of protecting their country - the most memorable of which is using LSD in an interrogation (with obvious results). Add in a solid supporting turn from Tammy Blanchard, and 'The Good Shepherd' certainly has a number of things going in its favour, but one's mileage is likely to vary based on patience and interest in the subject matter.",Null,2,2,1 February 2017
Arrival," Close Encounters
","Haunted by memories of a deceased teenage daughter, a lonely linguist agrees to assist in communicating with an extraterrestrial species in this first contact sci-fi outing from Denis Villeneuve. The film looks, sounds and feels like Villeneuve's earlier 'Sicario' with aerial shots that bask in lush landscapes, another perfectly brooding Jóhann Jóhannsson music score and yet another plot about a young woman out of her depth. The action content here is negligible though, which renders 'Arrival' refreshingly different from most other first contact movies as the film focuses on credible barriers with alien communication. The big question is whether the aliens are hostile or peaceful since it is impossible to understand them. The communication theme is not limited to the aliens though; with spaceships landing in twelve places around the world, issues arise from various countries being unwilling to share information. Much like 'Under the Skin', the film also highlights humankind's tendency to always react violently to what we do not understand, but there is actually a positive tone overall. The film has some pacing issues though. The conclusion is overly drawn out (with at least a couple of false endings) and the final few scenes only serve to blatantly spell out plot twists and turns that did not need to be explicitly stated. The scenes of various young military personnel having their doubts also distract from the protagonist's journey. Whatever the case, Amy Adams is solid in the lead role. Villeneuve lets his camera focus on her trembling hands as well as her face, allowing her to give a true full body performance. Strong support also comes from Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner even if it sometimes feels like they could have been given more to do.",Null,2,8,12 November 2016
The Big Short," Foresight
","Foreseeing the burst of the housing bubble that triggered the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, three sets of players in the high finance world elect to 'bet against the American economy' and reap the benefits in this offbeat mix of comedy and drama, based on a book by 'Moneyball' author Michael Lewis. There are some truly zany touches as characters break the fourth wall and announce that certain events 'didn't really happen that way' and there are interesting interludes in which celebrities such as Selena Gomez explain some of the finer technical terms required to understand the story. The film also has a complex editing design with montages of pop culture, scenes noticeably cut short and certain images paused for extended periods, all of which works to make the film anything but the didactic take on the situation that it so easily could have been; by contrast, it is more engaging than 'Inside Job' and it does a better job elucidating what exactly occurred. The crux of the film though are the characters who experience inner conflict over whether or not they are really 'good guys' by profiteering from the GFC. The characters are not explored in extreme depth (give or take Steve Carell as the closest the film has to a protagonist), however, they work well within their function in the plot, provoking us to evaluate whether there are really any heroes in the film's real life inspired story. The most remarkable aspect of the film though is how frequently funny it is. It is quite rare for a comedy (which 'The Big Short' primarily is) to spin such a passionate indictment of injustice.",Null,0,0,25 January 2016
The Conjuring," Haunted
","Loosely based on real events, this horror movie from 'Saw' director James Wan focuses on a house that a family begins to suspect is haunted and two paranormal researchers who they ask to perform an exorcism. The film does not hold a candle to the original 'Exorcist' movie from 1973, but it is a creepy experience all the same with Wan resorting to relatively few jump scares and precious little in the way of CGI; much of the horror is implied from the young daughters' reactions or characters screaming in the distance, with only the exorcism itself loaded with special effects. Wan also does well capturing the flavour of the 1970s with appropriate hairstyles, set decoration and language, etc. Refreshingly different as 'The Conjuring' may be from most contemporary horror movies, the basic story is still no great shakes; much of it feels like it has been done several times before with lots of run-of-the-mill haunted house elements. The novelty is meant to be the evil spirit attaches itself to its victims and haunts them rather than the house, but we rarely get a sense of this (the finale aside) as clocks stopping, strange sounds, figures in the shadows etc are all standard haunted house tropes. The cutting between the family and the paranormal specialists early on also tends to break up the tension. Whatever the case, Wan certainly crafts the movie well. His camera is often mobile, tracking and sliding eerily around the house, and there is a great scene in which one daughter peeks under the bed and the camera peeks along with her, even turning upside down.",Null,0,0,7 October 2016
Platoon," My brief review of the film
","At times horrifying and intensely realistic, this study of comradeship and fighting in war is a stunning, albeit imperfect, piece of cinema. The tropic setting is excellently portrayed, with natural sounds recorded brilliantly, but the explosions and noises of combats are equally captured well. The camera-work and editing and appropriately frantic, and Georges Delerue's haunting music sends a chill down the spine. The quality of the acting from the entire cast is superb and Charlie Sheen is fantastic in the lead - he is able to convey a sense of innocence for his character very well. Towards the end it all becomes a bit too monotonous, and the message feels like it is pushed a bit far, but the only really significant problem I found in it was that Dafoe and Berenger just seem too simply developed as symbols of good and evil. This is not however anything that detracts from the experience, but something that entered my after-thoughts.

Paths of Glory," My brief review of the film
","Based on fact, this superbly directed anti war film is both educational and powerful viewing. It depicts not only the attitudes of the corrupt army officials but also trench life and its futility too with excellence. As a film, it is pretty much a perfect film all round  even the length is appropriately short as to not allow for unnecessary sentiments to build up. Kirk Douglas does very well with his lead role, and he even felt that he worked so well under Kubrick's direction that he chose Kubrick to replace Anthony Mann as director of the epic 'Spartacus', a Hollywood success that lead Kubrick to be able to choose his own big budget projects.",Null,0,1,14 January 2005

","An absorbing allegory about the effects of high school bullying, it is disguised as a horror film to allude to the horror of such mental anguish. The film manages to depict true emotional concerns involved with school life and ontological pressures even while juggling an overcoat of horror. Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek are the perfect choices for their roles, and the overall film is impressive on a cinematic level. The only quirk in the film is the typically horror genre ending, but that hardly can affect the effectiveness of this emotional drama.

","Taken hostage in Istanbul by the Albanians whose relatives he mercilessly murdered in 'Taken', ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills has to rely on his daughter to rescue him in this action-packed sequel to the 2008 hit film. 'Taken 2' pushes the boundaries of credibility at many points (Neeson triangulating various locations) and it is not quite as well-paced as the first entry with half an hour of exposition before the action truly ignites, however, it is not a worthless sequel by any stretch of the imagination. The writers build up rapport between Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace as estranged father and daughter very well, and there is something quite amusing in how she does eventually get a long awaited real driving lesson from him late in the piece. The film's attempt to reverse the formula of the first film works surprisingly well too as she follows instructions from Neeson via cellular phone of how to rescue him. 'Taken 2' also acknowledges Neeson's callousness for the first time, and how with the Albanians he 'killed them all like they were so many nothings' - a refreshing moral stance almost completely absence from the original film. The script is far from perfect though with the sudden reconciliation between Famke Janssen and Neeson seeming like a mere plot device, not to mention many improbabilities, but it is a surprisingly gripping watch and Neeson is as sympathetic as ever as a man out to protect his family whatever the cost. 'Taken 2' is may not necessarily be a superior motion picture to Part One, but it is a lot more interesting than one might expect.",Null,0,0,19 June 2016
Iron Man," Iron Giant
","Based on the iconic comic book character, 'Iron Man' follows a weapons engineer who manufactures a flying armor suit and has to stop those interested in copying the suit for their own evil purposes. Robert Downey Jr. is well cast as the arrogant, wise-cracking protagonist. Shot down in the Middle East, his shock and utter disbelief over his weapons being sold on the black market, causing more harm than good, never quite rings true. His naivety does, however, allow for a solid character progression as he goes from only caring about how much money his company makes to genuinely caring about how his weapons are used. The film spends a refreshingly large amount of time on Downey's back- story too; there are only scattered action scenes during the first half of the movie as the focus is always making Downey's flawed character likable before he turns superhero. The other characters are sadly less interesting. Unrecognisable at first with one zany hairdo, Jeff Bridges has some fun bits, but the likes of Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are given little to do; the film also keeps going back and forth on the possibility of Paltrow as a love interest for Downey. Between the film's robot butler, the in-depth character back-story and Downey's charisma, 'Iron Man' has a lot going in its favour, but whether it is truly one of the better superhero movies out there is debatable.",Null,1,1,26 May 2017
Blade Runner," My brief review of the film
","A dark and pessimistic view of the future, the film has some excellent lighting, good special effects and a brilliant production design, as well as some things to say in terms of artificial intelligence. However, the film is overall rather a routine sci-fi action thriller under the visual marvels. The story is quite simplistic, with typical romance and the idea of getting rid of the baddies, and neither the characters nor the acting is too stunning. The music feels a tad inappropriate too, but generally it is a rather well made film. It has thrills, style and some intriguing questions - and such is enough to keep one watching, no matter what problems one may have with it.",Null,0,1,17 March 2005
Mr. Holland's Opus," Teaching isn't easy
","Taking a position as a high school music teacher in order to pay the bills, an aspiring composer finds the job unexpectedly challenging but also unexpectedly rewarding in this Oscar nominated drama starring Richard Dreyfuss. The film gets off to a solid start with Dreyfuss discovering his every preconception of teaching challenged; there is no 'free time', 'high school is not a democracy' and it is absolutely impossible to leave campus at the same time as his students do. The movie missteps though by not spending more time on this section of his journey; before long, Dreyfuss transforms into an obsessively motivated teacher who has simply come to accept the demands of the job. A deaf son is eventually thrown into the mix to give Dreyfuss a chance to realise how his obsession with his job is negatively impacting on home life, but there is nothing especially novel or exciting about this plot development. A maudlin music score does not help matters either. In fact, were it not for its towering lead performance, 'Mr. Holland's Opus' would be difficult to endure. Fortunately, Dreyfuss is in fine form, credibly ageing over 30 years during the course of the movie. The film also does a good job capturing his reactions to various historical events over the three decades portrayed on screen (his grief over John Lennon's death is highly memorable). Whether this alone is enough to render the film worth viewing may vary per viewer. Clocking in at nearly two and half hours long, the film is not an easy, breezy watch, but fans of its lead actor might well find it worthwhile.",Null,4,4,11 June 2016
Toy Story 3," Falling with Style Part 3
","Convinced that a now college-aged Andy intended to throw them out, his toys take refuge at a daycare centre with unexpectedly rough kids in this third film in the 'falling with style' franchise. The movie tackles slightly different ideas to what we have seen before with Andy torn between moving on and hanging onto the toys he once cherished. There is also a magnificent sequence in which are treated to the detailed insides of a landfill station. For the most part though, the plot of 'Toy Story 3' bares such a strong resemblance to Parts One and Two that it never quite feels like a motion picture of its own. Once again, the story is propelled by the toys not believing and trusting Woody (as per the first film) before meeting an antagonist who initially appears friendly and jolly, which then leads to them making a daring escape (as per the second film). The antagonists in both the second and third film even meet with similar fates! The themes and issues are also strikingly familiar with owners who move on and toys who find themselves no longer wanted. The film does have novelties up its sleeve though. The Mr. Tortilla Head scenes are delightfully zany and the parody of prison escape movies works quite well. There are also some great new toys - even if they do not get a whole lot of screen time. Capped off with an emotionally charged finale (watch for Andy's face and eyes), it is easy to see why many have been won over by the charm of 'Toy Story 3', even if it does not pull in anywhere near as many new directions as the previous films.",Null,2,3,24 February 2017
The Deer Hunter," My brief review of the film
","A film in which there is a lot that can be discussed, this is a good film overall, but definitely one with some flaws. The film is essentially about the varying possible effects that undergoing torture can have on different individuals. With the Vietnam War in the backdrop, it could be deduced that the film is also about the effects of war on the individual, but such little time is spent war scenes that it is hardly a war film, and war related themes are derived only from the symbolism that one might associate Russian roulette with. Anyway, that should be hardly taken a statement on the quality of the film. Cimino is able to set up some really intense scenes, the acting is generally fine, and the film does have some solid ideas, not only about the effects of torture, but also about strong friendships. The key element that limits the power of the film is a number of plot contrivances, that vary from being rather unlikely to next to impossible, and that is without including some of the factual wrongs with the film. The reoccurrence of Russian roulette could also be regarded as heavy-handed, depending on whether one regards it as a symbol of the futility or chances of war. Could something else not also be used to allude to this? It also is an overly long and drawn out film. The first hour is meant to give us a chance to know the characters a bit better, but even so, it goes on for too long, full of excesses of dance, humorous bits and abandoned subplots, all that inform us precious little of the characters. There is a subplot with two of the characters in the latter half of the film that is undernourished too. The music is not really any help either: it is too sickly sentimental to tie in very well. I found a few others things that I also did not like that I will not mention here for fear of ruining a fresh experience of the movie. It is a good film, even if a grueling watch, despite its drawbacks. As a film about the everlasting physical and mental effects of torture, it does a reasonable job, and as a film about the extreme lengths that one goes for a friend, it also stands up fairly well.",Null,3,6,10 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A New Hope Awakens
","Three decades after the events of 'Return of the Jedi', it is up to a young scavenger and a former storm trooper to save the day as the Evil Empire threatens to rise again in this seventh 'Star Wars' film. Whereas 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' suffered from pacing issues and underdeveloped characters, this entry is a well paced, exciting ride and the new characters are excellent. John Boyega is superb the former storm trooper in question and even with his helmet on, his emotions come through his actions as he gradually decides to rebel and flee. His mixed emotions when fleeing are great too; part of him wants to be a hero for once, while the rest of him is humanly scared. Daisy Ridley is even better though, emulating all the youthful enthusiasm of Mark Hamill in the 1977 original and more as her character, Rey, comes to realise unknown powers within her. Promising this sounds though, the plot more often feels like a reboot of the 1977 film than a sequel to it. The trials and tribulations of Luke and Rey are near identical, including coming into possession of a droid with a secret message. Adam Driver also seems uncomfortable playing the equivalent of Darth Vader in black mask no less. He has some unintentionally funny moments as he lets his anger get the better of him, destroying expensive equipment with his light saber (he comes across as a bit of a spoiled brat). For all its drawbacks though, 'The Force Awakens' is difficult not to like. There is a fun new droid on hand, the film includes winks at the prior entries without ever being too cute and the final shot is solid, if an obvious set-up for the next 'Star Wars' to come. Great special effects and spectacular sets do not hurt either.",Null,2,23,27 December 2015
Final Destination," Foresight
","Having foreseen the impending explosion of a plane and saved his friends' lives, a teenager becomes convinced that they accidentally cheated death and that a grim fate still awaits them in this slick horror-thriller. While similar to Thom Eberhardt's 'Sole Survivor', this latter film is still blessed with a fairly original premise and there are several intense moments to be had as the teens try to avoid Death coming for them after two of the surviving friends die in mysterious circumstances. The premise does, however, offer far more questions than answers, such as why Devon Sawa's character is sometimes able to foresee what will happen, why Death takes so long to come after them again, and most strikingly, why almost all of the deaths are elaborate and over-the-top. Imaginative death scenes are great in a movie such as a 'Friday the 13th' sequel, but here it just seems pointless if we assume that Death really wants the characters dead. While it might not all make sense, 'Final Destination' is nevertheless incredibly well filmed. The early moments of Sawa's hyper-awareness pre-flight are very well done and the camera hardly ever sits still throughout, often gliding and sweeping over the characters in a creepy manner. The film additionally deserves some credit for ending on a darkly comic laugh for what it is otherwise a rather grim take on fate and predestination.",Null,0,0,6 October 2017
Rear Window," Lots to see, even on a third viewing
","Made around the same time that televisions started to become an essential part of the home, 'Rear Window' paints an interesting time capsule of a society devoid of television, where the only entertainment if stuck at home all day is watching the neighbours' activities. In fact, 'Rear Window' could even be seen as a film about television, with Jeffries, the protagonist, switching views of other apartments just like a man constantly changing channels on his television set. As Thelma Ritter's character Stella says, 'We have become a race of peeping toms', relating to a key issue of the film: the voyeuristic tendencies of society.Although it would not be made for another twelve years, the film bears a strong resemblance to 'Blowup', with Jeffries stating that 'right now, I'd welcome trouble', an indication that his mind is overactive, searching for something interesting to follow. And with his detective friend, a character representing the devil's advocate, we are constantly hanging on the edge, weighing up the evidence for ourselves. We are also able to do more investigating than what the characters themselves conduct. In different windows, different events occur, some of which the protagonists note, and others of which we ourselves observe only.The cinematography helps a lot in serving this cause. There are at least a couple of shots that scan the courtyard and then go back into Jeffries' apartment. These shots at first appear to be taken from the perspective of the characters, but since they do not end on the characters looking out the window, Hitchcock establishes a separation between us and the characters. We are learning more about what is happening outside when they are distracted. The way we are introduced to Jeffries also probes us to investigate: first we see his leg, then photos of accidents, and only later do we realise that the photographs are of potential accidents, rather than photos of his accident.The opening shots of the film are amazing. Three blinds are slowly opened in the background as the main credits roll, just like how we are slowly opening our eyes as the film begins. Then the camera goes through the window, explores the courtyard, and finally ends up inside Jeffries' apartment, and on a perfectly focused shot of Jeffries. Another great shot is Lisa's first scene, where she kisses Jeffries in slow motion, almost as if it is a dream. The film is full of great shots and excellent camera-work, and to think - Hitchcock probably had to call most of those shots from the distance! It's a very fine directorial achievement.Speaking of Hitchcock, his cameo here serves more purpose than in any other film of his. Before Thorwald notices that he is being watched, Hitch is the only character to actually look back at Jeffries. And aside from that, it's quite interesting with the whole relationship that is then established between director, actor, film, audience: the whole chain that is controlling what we are seeing. If nothing else, Hitch's cameo reminds us that even though we see more than what the characters are see, we only ever see ourselves what he allows us to see.",Null,5,10,11 February 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," My brief review of the film
","The third and final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is an entry that is once again visually impressive to the point of perfection, but also once again with little substance. Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time  that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein's story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success  not how much effort one puts in. It is impossible to deny how much effort the whole cast and crew went to in order to produce this spectacular looking film, but they only ever half-succeeded in capturing the magic of Tolkein's tales.",Null,27,53,8 January 2004
Munich," My extended review of the film
","The word limit unfortunately limits how much I can say here, and I'm sure that there is more to say. These are however some thoughts of mine after seeing 'Munich' for the second time in a cinema after a friend invited me to see it again with him.'Munich' has been criticised by some for its ambiguity, but if anything, I think Spielberg's refusal to take sides in the Israeli/Palestinian conflicts is the best aspect of the film. It is not condoning the actions of Palestinian terrorists, but neither is it supportive of the way in which Israel reacts. There is hardly any bias in the film, which should satisfy those who thought that 'Schindler's List' was not ambiguous enough. According to some reviewers, Spielberg's film is too ambiguous this time round though. Personally, I do not agree to either of those charges. Sometimes the pettiest of reasons are used to badmouth a film. Then again, I'm sure some will regard my supportive comments as petty. So, I will not call 'Munich' the second best film that I have seen this decade, even though it feels that way to me. I'll just take this opportunity to provide some thoughts on why I believe it to be very good. The plot of the film is best discussed when one knows everything that happens in the film. Therefore, I would advise to not read ahead if you have not already seen 'Munich'. My discussion from this point forth, contains spoilers that may ruin a fresh experience.It is hard to condense what the film is about to just one issue, but ultimately it is about the futility of the violence between Palestinians and Israelis. Spielberg does not try to argue who is right or who is wrong, as the reason why the conflicts have started is not important, and this idea is mirrored in the five men unofficially hired by the Israeli government. The assassins do not have any proof of the guilt of those who they are going after, which leads them to at times question whether they are doing right. The one thing that they seem to all fall back on is that even if their targets were not responsible for Munich, they are responsible for other acts of terrorism against the Jews, a point emphasised at the end by Ephraim. But is that good enough reason?Something I find interesting is that none of the killings go as planned, except for one. With the first killing, they are nervous, with the next couple the explosions are too big, and the list goes on. Also, they meet innocent bystanders or other people who may indirectly suffer at every killing scene except the first. The only assassination that they get right, and do not meet any possible indirect sufferers at, is the Dutch woman who was hired to kill Carl. The whole temptress subplot involving her is significant. The reason why they are able to do such a good job killing her is because there is no doubt to her guilt, and they were directly affected by her actions. Avner experiences twice the effects of the others though, because not only did the temptress make him think about cheating on his wife, he was also the one who recommended her to Carl.The film is also about how involvement in conflicts can have everlasting effects. Each of the five assassins experiences suffering as a result of their work. The characters are all very human - not at all like the typical image one has as a hired assassin. They come close to mucking up their very first job, and they dash frantically out afterwards. They are insecure and doubtful about how much of the truth they are being told. As for the actual effects that they suffer, the details are unimportant. It does not matter whether Robert and Hans decided to kill themselves or whether they were assassinated (Spielberg leaves this question hanging). Their involvement in the conflict killed them. Carl died too, and Avner emerges paranoid. We do not see the detrimental effect on Steve, but we still understand it to exist. Steve is strong on the outside, but who knows what he is like inside.The technical aspects of the film are excellent. The camera-work is stunning, with plenty of movement, both following the characters around, and dollying to get close up to television screen and important details. The editing is brilliant, with scene changes including papers being shuffled on a desk turning into papers flying in the street, and the editing in of actual footage flows perfectly. The film actually balances two plot lines that are weaved in thanks to clever editing. At certain times, the actual hostage happenings at Munich are shown, almost like flashbacks - they fade in and out, with matching colour designs. The colour and lighting work is general is great too.There is no doubt something to admire in the art direction also. The backgrounds are mood setting, and it is really interesting to look at the contrast between set up between children in swimwear, running around when Ephraim and Avner first go for a walk, compared to the stillness of the New York backdrop at the end. John Williams' music score includes some drum work this time round, and it is most effective in keeping up the suspense and intensity of certain scenes. It goes without saying that Spielberg does a good job in the director's chair, so the last thing to mention is the acting. Eric Bana is probably the best of the cast, as a man who loses any innocence that he might have once had forever, but all of the supporting cast do fine. Overall, it is a very impressive piece of cinema with plenty that can be looked into in finer details. I would consider say some more here, but IMDb's word limit plays a limiting factor there.",Null,9,13,30 January 2006
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Going back in time
","Provided with a time machine by future beings with a vested interest in seeing them pass History, two high school slackers travel back in time and capture assorted historical figures in this popular 80s comedy. Given how nonsensical the plot is (the film assumes that interactions with historical figures will not alter the past - plus the Beethoven of the film is not deaf), the movie relies heavily on the charm and likability of its young protagonists to carry things through and fortunately the chemistry between stars Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves is spot-on all the way. The pair mispronouncing names such as Freud and Socrates admittedly grows groan-inducing quite quickly, but there is something to be said for the way Winter and Reeves seem able to predict one another's moves, often saying and doing spontaneous things in synchrony. The film also gets some good laughs from having historical figures at a loss to twentieth century living (Freud's constant psychoanalysing of everything is great), however, contemporary interactions with Napoleon were done more cleverly in 'I Dream of Jeannie' and the film does not feature anywhere near enough scenes in which the historical figures bond with each other; one of the best scenes has Socrates and Billy the Kid trying to hit on girls together like high school pals. While bits and pieces of the film do not work though, everything spirals towards a memorable, if over-the-top, auditorium climax and the final line that George Carlin says to the camera ensures that the film at least concludes on a humorous note.",Null,0,0,1 January 2016
Life," Death
","Not the Eddie Murphy comedy of the same name, a more appropriate title might be 'Death' as this film focuses on a spaceship crew gradually eliminated by an ever-evolving Martian lifeform. The film has earned unfavourable comparisons to 'Alien', however, the plot differs in unexpected ways. Most notably, the crew in 'Life' initially befriend the lifeform and raise it in an artificial atmosphere with some great early moments and excellent CGI as the minute creature curls back and forth and forms retractable limbs. The alien's motives are also very different here as it only kills in defense, with the crew bringing the horror upon themselves by their unorthodox administering of electrical shocks and then trying to kill it when it understandably defends itself. This agenda would, however, work better with more credible characters. For highly trained scientists, the team often let emotions get in the way and recklessly break safety protocols. The film also lacks characters as interesting as Ellen Ripley, but Jake Gyllenhaal has some good parts as an astronaut who -- after spending over a year in space -- would prefer to stay there for the rest of his life. With lots of mindless carnage and less interesting creature effects as it increases in size, the film sometimes feels like wasted potential. It is, however, capped off with a really powerful ending and Jon Ekstrand's brooding score is great throughout.",Null,4,8,23 April 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Shadows and Fog
","Four twenty-first century New Zealand vampires are interviewed by a documentary crew in this horror mockumentary written, directed by and starring Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi. Much of the film was reportedly improvised with over 100 hours of footage shot. As such, the film is highly uneven with some sequences dragging; the 'swear-wolves' in particular are far less interesting than the vampire protagonists. Most of the film clicks into place nicely though, and while scattered gags misfire, there are far more hits than misses. At the film's funniest, two police officers visit the vampires' den (dilapidated house) and (without checking) accept that a bloodied corpse on a dirty floor is a drunk friend who has passed out, instructing the vampires to at least place a pillow under his head! Clement also has a great deadpan moment as he casually announces that he must have hit a main artery after his attempt to drain a woman's blood turns messy. Humour aside, the film is thoughtfully assembled with archive footage gloriously spliced into the mix, as well as some faux newspaper headlines. There is also much to like in how comically anachronistic the vampires (wearing period costumes for the most part) are, using Skype to stay in contact and repeatedly failing to get into local nightclubs since they need to be 'invited in'. There are also some fun references to 'The Lost Boys' and vampire lore in general, including vampires' ability to hypnotise and get people to look at them, which for our not-so-skilled nosferatus involves physically knocking on their doors!",Null,1,2,2 April 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Spy movie parody elements plus fireworks
","Not your average James Bond spoof, this espionage comedy features characters who acknowledge the Bond franchise and lament the serious turn taken by the series in recent years with less colourful villains and less imaginative plots. At the same time, 'Kingsman' also features a plot deliciously absurd on the level of 'Dr. No' and 'Goldfinger' with a villain set on destroying most of the human population from his glamorous lair in the side of a mountain. The gadgetry on offer also has a zaniness not seen in the Bond franchise since Desmond Llewelyn's heyday as Q. And yet, even with such absurdities in place, the villain's scheme is remarkably relevant to the world today with climate change issues and conservation in mind, and there is a memorable speech in which humankind is compared to a virus slowly destroying Earth. The film is not without its drawbacks; the tone is often uneven as the story constantly flips back and forth from serious to comedic. Samuel L. Jackson also tends to overplay the villain, lisping half the time for no particularly good reason. Colin Firth on the other hand is very, very good as the proper gentleman spy who trains our protagonist; the way he keeps calm and cool all the time offers some of the film's greatest laughs. The action sequences are also noticeably well coordinated and while the heavy carnage has understandably attracted complaints from some, the filmmakers are careful not use bloodshed for bloodshed's sake. Few films (if any) have used fireworks quite the same way as they are used here!",Null,3,7,21 December 2015
The Hangover Part III," Wolf Pack Conclusion
","Whereas the second 'Hangover' movie was more of a rehash of the first adventure than a true sequel to it, this third 'Hangover' entry does some decidedly different things with mixed yet mostly positive results. Most notably, the film taps into several of the original's subplots as the drug dealer's unseen boss from the first film gets a face with John Goodman in a performance that delightfully references 'The Big Lebowsk'. The fact that Goodman decides to hold on to Justin Bartha (Doug) while forcing the rest of the Wolf Pack to work for him never quite feels like the right move (a more ambitious sequel would have had Doug finally share his friends' adventures) but there is little disputing how well the three main players interact with each other and Ken Jeong gets more screen time than ever before, as well as scattered character growth. Mike Epps and Heather Graham also make welcome returns to the story with the film possessing some truly touching moments as the friends visit Graham's baby from the first film, now at an age at which he can walk and talk. The less said about Melissa McCarthy's extended cameo here, the better though, and some gags (giraffe) push the boundaries of good taste, but in general there is quite a lot here to like with the film actually building on the events of the first two movies rather than just aping them.",Null,0,0,29 April 2017
The Thin Red Line," Fighting Own Wars
","Decidedly different to the 1964 movie, this Terrence Malick version broadens the scope in the original film, giving equal focus to several World War II soldiers of the same platoon as opposed to just Pvt. Doll and Sgt. Welsh. This allows Malick to explore the war from varying perspectives, with multiple narrators and multiple flashbacks; as the film's tagline goes, we really see how 'every man fights his own war'. The film is accompanied by atmospheric music from Hans Zimmer, eerily sharp sounds and tracking shots that effectively crawl along with the soldiers (as if the camera is a soldier). The dreaminess of the flashbacks works well too. Admirable as Malick's approach is, it is nevertheless hard not to yearn for the intensity of the 1964 version, which - by focusing on just one private and one sergeant - acutely captured the ability of war to truly transform a human being. The titular line between madness and sanity also comes out more prominently in the earlier version. There are additionally so many protagonists in the 1998 film that one seldom gets to know them as individuals. The film's sprawling nature is quite true to the madness and mayhem of war though, and the dialogue is as poetic and haunting as ever. It may be unclear whether Malick's version of the tale makes for a more powerful war movie, but it is certainly daringly different and memorable in its own way.",Null,1,2,9 June 2017
Spectre," Very decent if not up to the par set by 'Skyfall'
","As one might gather from the title, this 24th entry in the official 007 series reintroduces Blofeld and the SPECTRE organisation (of 1960s Bond) for the post-Cold War era. The results are relatively successful, even if it often feels like the filmmakers are stretching it by connecting all of the villains of the first three Craig Bond movies to SPECTRE. Christoph Waltz is solid too, however, his performance is hampered by his limited screen time and the difficulty of not comparing his work to Javier Bardem, who one entry earlier created one of the most memorable Bond villains ever in 'Skyfall'. It is also difficult not to compare the overall film to 'Skyfall' - to which it pales - but 'Spectre' works fine if taken as a film on its own. The film benefits greatly from the uniqueness of having M, Q and Moneypenny work side by side in conjunction with Bond throughout. It is debatable whether Q and Moneypenny have ever had as pivotal roles as they do here, and there is something potent in the noticeable bond (pun intended) between all four. The film also successfully carries on 'Casino Royale' and 'Skyfall''s agenda of the double-O program becoming obsolete while including some relevant media and terrorism angles. The film is additionally superbly shot throughout by 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema with effective focus manipulation, lots of mobile camera-work and some excellent shots early on as Bond walks for metres on end towards the camera, setting one on edge, not knowing where he is heading - which is a nice metaphor for the twisty, turn-y plot too.",Null,1,3,30 November 2015
Joy," The road to success is rarely smooth
","Inspired by real events, this David O. Russell motion picture tells of the struggle of a divorced single mother to make it as an entrepreneur while juggling woes with her immediate and extended family. Released with an enigmatic trailer and initial promotional posters that were just white writing against black, it seems that Russell intended the film to be seen with minimal expectations and there are admittedly some surprises in how the plot unfolds. Everything begins on a quirky note as we are introduced to Joy and her unusual living arrangements. Her reclusive mother refuses to leave her bed, lest she miss a soap opera episode. She is divorced from Joy's father, who has begun to share the basement with her own ex-husband, while her grandmother takes care of their kids upstairs! There are some even zanier moments to come as Joy dreams of herself starring in one of her mother's shoddy soap operas and attending a surreal funeral. The film nevertheless fails to maintain this offbeat tone throughout as Joy becomes set on selling her invention, no matter the cost, and while Jennifer Lawrence has several fine dramatic moments as she struggles to overcome the odds, the film soon becomes yet another tale of an underdog rising against the odds, only really distinguishable on account of the solid performances. And yet while it lacks the spark that made Russell's previous two Golden Globe winning comedies so remarkable, the film is often engaging to view and watchable to the end. Particularly interesting is all the gun symbolism and a decision Joy makes this towards the end of the film.",Null,0,4,1 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Road Warriors
","Tom Hardy takes over the role made famous by Mel Gibson in this fourth film in the 'Mad Max' series. The plot has Max reluctantly team up with a renegade female trucker transporting the abused, pregnant wives of a tyrant to safety; distrust turns to mutual respect as the pair fend off attacks from the tyrant's underlings. Right from the opening monologue, 'Fury Road' feels like a decidedly different 'Mad Max' film; add in cutaways to Max's memories of a young girl and the action hero is more conflicted and haunted here than ever before. The film additionally does something different by giving Charlize Theron much screen time as the gutsy trucker with her own insecurities as she searches for her hometown as a safe place for the wives. These two angles do not mesh all that well together, with Max oddly relegated to a supporting character despite a deeper than ever glimpse into his psyche. The limited exposition also leaves open unanswered questions regarding blood transfusions, whether fertility is an issue and what everyone's obsession is with painting their teeth. Some elements (a rock guitarist strapped to the front of one truck) also come off as simply weird for the sake of it. And yet, if never entirely successful, there remains something to like in George Miller taking the material in new directions rather than just recycling what has been done before.",Null,0,0,28 May 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Brave
","Based on the true story of an army medic who insisted on never carrying a weapon, 'Hacksaw Ridge' tells a slice of World War II history that dares to redefine traditional notions of bravery. The graphic battle scenes are very well done with Gibson never shying away from the severity of battle wounds and how precious life in war is. For all is virtues though, the film often feels preachy with the protagonist's religion-motivated pacifism (and how this repulses everyone in the army) repeatedly brought up. A formulaic romance also weighs against the film and some of the casting is downright odd, with Vince Vaughn especially awkward as a drill sergeant who is hardly fearsome and seldom angry. The casting of Hugo Weaving as the medic's father is a stroke of genius though with Weaving stealing every scene as a former war veteran plagued by inner demons and horrific memories of World War I. Andrew Garfield is fine in the lead role, though against 'The Social Network', '99 Homes' and others, it is hardly his best work. Overall, this is an easy to film to recommend for those keen on unflinchingly realistic battle scenes and detailed insights into military bureaucracy. It is hardly a flawless film and perhaps a little message-heavy for its own good, however, it says quite a lot that the movie manages to pack a punch even when one knows about his heroism to come.",Null,5,7,5 June 2017
The Runaways," Running
","Recruited for what would become a pioneer all-female hard rock band in the 1970s, two teenagers have to contend with whether to promote their music or sex appeal as per the wishes of their eccentric music producer in this film based on the true experiences of the title band that propelled Joan Jett to fame. The film is based on the memoirs of the band's lead singer, Cherie Currie, and the film is mostly spent on the dynamics and rising tensions between Joan and Cherrie, with Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart both convincing in the respective roles. Fanning has some particularly good moments towards the end as all the fame gets to her head and a final conversation between the pair provides a perfect note for the film to end on. In order to focus on these two big personalities, the film uncomfortably ignores the other three members of the band though, all of whom are so lightly developed that they remain completely interchangeable throughout. The fact that Cherie's family background gets such a large focus over Joan's when they are equal protagonists does not quite sit well either. Never to mind, the film is well paced enough that there is rarely a dull moment with Michael Shannon stealing every scene he is in as the band's off-the-wall producer with the craziest twinkle in his eye as he gets them to practise playing while food is thrown at them (!) and as he keeps going on about all negative publicity being good. There is also a lot to like about the girls' determination to succeed in a traditionally all-male industry no matter what it takes.",Null,1,2,8 March 2017
Donnie Darko," My brief review of the film
","An amazing sci-fi film that stuns, scares and startles, amidst a creepy atmosphere that the writer-director manages to bring to the film. The mysterious and rather intriguing nature of the film is enough to drown out even the likes of David Lynch. In all technical aspects the film is finely done, especially on a visual scope, with some great special effects and excellent use of lighting. The film's screenplay is almost perfect: it injects just the amount of comic relief without neglecting what the premise of the film demands. It is a touch confusing, but still a superb film, regardless of whether or not one is able to understand.",Null,2,4,19 January 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Keep Up with the Jonses
","Learning of a Nazi plot to steal the Holy Grail, archaeologist Indiana Jones sets out to stop them, a quest that leads to him working alongside his estranged father in this second sequel to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Sean Connery is well cast as Indy's father, with very natural banter between them and there are some great action sequences - most notably a fight on a wooden boat being crushed by a propeller. Nothing quite matches the riveting opening few scenes though in which River Phoenix plays Indy as a lad with bits and pieces that explain his fear of snakes, love of whips and iconic hat. Many curiously regard this as better than 'Temple of Doom', yet for all its flaws and Kate Capshaw's shrillness, the second movie feels like a motion picture of its own whereas 'Crusade' is more of a rehash of 'Raiders' than a tribute to it. The plots are near identical, with Nazi bad guys and a Biblical artifact McGuffin, and neither 'Raiders' nor 'Crusade' can match the non-stop action thrills and humour of 'Temple of Doom' with most of the comic relief this time coming from Denholm Elliott being turned into a bumbling old man. All three films are technically well-made and riveting at their utmost best. As popular as 'Last Crusade' is, personal preferences will likely determine whether one likes it the most of the original trilogy or not.",Null,0,0,30 June 2017
13 Hours," The Hours
","Six security guards struggle to protect the American Ambassador to Libya when his compound is attacked in this true story action thriller. '13 Hours' gets off to a strong start with the latest security recruit's car stopped by local militants in an intense, tone setting scene. As the film subsequently introduces each character in depth, '13 Hours' exhibits all the promise of a war movie with a difference. As soon the compound attack occurs though, this potential goes out the window with gunfire and explosions so rapid and nonstop that it is easy to lose track of what is happening. The action does pause at one point with one security guard ruefully stating that 'downtime is the worst' since it forces you to think about your loved ones and contemplate whether you are fighting for a country you care nothing about - but such thoughtful dialogue exchanges are sadly few and far between with the explosive action resuming shortly afterwards. The action sequences are at least well crafted and Dion Beebe does a great job allowing most of the action to be visible despite nighttime conditions. It is also hard to resent the film's Best Sound Oscar nomination even if campaign violations may have led to the nomination. Overall, this is a decent movie and if not a total success, it is a refreshing attempt from Michael Bay to add some meat to the high octane action stuff he is best known for.",Null,0,1,16 June 2017
Sully," Flight
","Aiming to tell the 'untold story behind the Miracle on the Hudson', this true story drama from Clint Eastwood documents Chesley Sullenberger's safe landing of a damaged plane on a river and how the National Transportation Safety Board sought to scrutinise his actions rather than celebrate him saving the lives of everyone on board. 'In the end, I'm going be judged on 208 seconds' laments Sully, played by Tom Hanks here, and this is the most fascinating aspect of the film: the verdict will determine how everyone will always perceive him, all other merits aside. The film only engages in this dilemma occasionally though, and it is only in the final half hour in which the National Transportation Safety Board put Sully on trial that the film takes off. The first hour of is not worthless, but it is certainly uneven. Clint's decision to leave the real crash until midway through works well as it places doubt in our own minds as to what transpired, but since Hanks does not have a deeply flawed character like Denzel Washington in the similarly themed 'Flight', it is only so interesting to watch him wallow in self-doubt. The inclusion of extraneous flashbacks, like a father and two sons almost missing the flight, also feels like a poor attempt to beef the running time up to feature length. Indeed, the story here is slim for a standard length motion picture with (again) none of the plot complexities of 'Flight'. As always, Clint directs the film in a classy manner and if one avoids thinking about the Washington film in the same breath, it is a solidly assembled piece, if one that could have been much more.",Null,0,0,6 January 2017
Princess Mononoke," Humans and Wildlife
","Attacked by a wild boar and infected by the madness that drove the boar insane, a young warrior stumbles upon a war between human villagers and intelligent wildlife in this animated drama from the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. The film benefits from having no clear-cut villains or heroes; both the humans and the wildlife merely want to use the same territory for their own means and the project as such comes with some positive ecological messages in terms of trying to be sustainable and live in harmony. The most fascinating character is the title one though - a human raised by wolves as one of their own. Oddly enough, considering that the film is named after her, the Princess is only ever a supporting character in the proceedings. Furthermore, the film only ever lightly touches on the intriguing personal identity issues that come with being raised as something that one is not. Fortunately, the infected warrior is a curious enough character with his resilience in the face of impending death that the film still chugs along well. It is also refreshing to see an animated fantasy film that dares to show graphic carnage in order further the story-line. If not quite as dark and impressively nightmarish as 'Watership Down', this Japanese offering certainly comes close to it. In short, this is a relatively engrossing tale if not nearly the best thing that Miyazaki has ever done.",Null,0,0,2 September 2017
Jurassic Park," Not just another Jaws
","It might sound like little more than 'Jaws' with dinosaurs as this Steven Spielberg thriller focuses on mayhem at an amusement park where dinosaurs have been brought back to life, but 'Jurassic Park' a unique and exciting thriller in its own right and one that stands up to multiple viewings. The dinosaurs are quite breathtaking CGI creations, and more than that, they are menacing at all the right times. The dinosaur attacks are very well done with Spielberg not relying on music (sort of the opposite of 'Jaws') and instead dead silence to render the attacks frightening. Spielberg throws a lot of neat directing tricks in the mix too, such as extreme close-ups on Samuel L. Jackson's technician and decent doses of humour, like an 'objects in mirror are closer than they appear' warning visible as a dinosaur roars into an automobile side mirror. Not so successful are the film's attempts to drill home messages such as the risks of tampering with nature, all spelled out through character dialogue. The way the child-hating Sam Neill eventually learns to bond with kids is also so forced and obvious from early on that it never really works despite a credible turn from Ariana Richards as a surrogate daughter of sorts. In fact, the film is very well acted overall, give or take Wayne Knight's inappropriately comical performance as the closest the film has a human antagonist. The strongest of the cast is Jeff Goldblum as a mathematician who finds himself often talking to himself, but Jackson, Neill and Richard Attenborough as the amusement park owner have their strong moments too.",Null,1,1,24 January 2016
Alien: Covenant," Alien Resurrected
","Answering a distress call on an unfamiliar planet, a space crew are hunted by aliens who use human bodies to breed in this Ridley Scott sci-fi thriller. The film is often atmospheric and the special effects are as expected good, but marketed as both a sequel to 'Prometheus' and a prequel to 'Alien', this entry suffers from trying too hard to fit under both banners. There are quite a few alien attacks, but the action does not begin until over 45 minutes and it is seldom anything new or original. The characters are also fleshed out in such little depth that it is hard to get emotionally invested in their struggle to survive. The 'Prometheus'-like elements work better with acute creator and creation themes and a glimpse into androids trying philosophise their purpose beyond serving humanity, but this is very much in the backdrop as the alien attacks become more and more rampant. The vast planet setting additionally lacks the intense spaceship claustrophobia a la 'Alien' and 'Aliens' and absent are the themes of human irresponsibility that made the earlier entries so potent with characters whose doom is brought on by corporate greed, venturing into worlds where humans do not belong and so forth. The film is certainly never boring and Michael Fassbender makes the most of his dual role, but it is easy to see why this was not the sequel that many die-hard fans wanted.",Null,0,4,1 September 2017
The Fighter," Two Brothers
","On the rise to fame and success, a young boxer must decide whether to continue training with his family or seek professional training and management elsewhere in this sports drama based on true events. Mark Wahlberg is solid as the conflicted boxer in question and Amy Adams does well cast-against-type as his foul-mouthed bartender girlfriend, but is Christian Bale who steals every scene he is in as Wahlberg's older brother. A former boxing legend himself, Bale has delusions of grandeur and believes that the TV crew who have recently arrived to film him are making a documentary about his long awaited comeback when in reality they are making a film about his descent into heroine addiction. The overall film fascinatingly follows this structure too, opening with a lot of focus on Bale, only for Wahlberg to be eventually revealed as the true star (what a great metaphor for Bale's character coming to realise that not everything is about him). Melissa Leo also gets quite a bit of screen time as the brothers' overbearing mother, however, the rest of the family are disappointingly barely fleshed out all, including Jack McGee as Wahlberg's father, who could have been quite interesting given that he actually sides with Adams about his son's career. As for the sisters, they are all interchangeable stereotypes. This is, however, principally a film about the brothers and their every interaction is compelling. The end credits are also worth watching here for appearances by the brothers whose lives the film was based on - Dicky and Micky Ward.",Null,3,3,25 February 2017
From Here to Eternity," My brief review of the film
","An emotionally gripping classic drama, it is well acted and is able to paint a vivid picture of life at a naval base, but yet the film feels like a soap opera too often when it could rather be a powerful paralleling of historical events and human emotions. This was perhaps not the intention of the film, but I cannot help but feel that there is some wasted potential, although I still thoroughly liked the film either way. It is quite potent stuff, especially towards the end, and the acting is superb from all the main players, with Montgomery Clift and Oscar winner Frank Sinatra in memorably powerful roles. The film slightly outstays its welcome, and a general knowledge of the portrayed history is assumed, but it sits well in one's memory, and much can be found to like it in, even if one does not like it all.",Null,1,2,18 April 2005
