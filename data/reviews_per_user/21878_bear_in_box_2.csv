Raiders of the Lost Ark," Greatest Protagonist of all Time
","I don't think it helpful for me to blabber on and on about how it is my favorite movie of all time and how I dressed up like Indiana Jones every Halloween for seven years. Instead I hope to clarify to naysayers why exactly Indiana Jones is the most remarkable and fascinating of all movie heroes.There are many words that can describe Jones: Courageous? Yes; Smart? try Brilliant; Obsessed? Absolutely. And he's also quick and funny and drop dead gorgeous etc. But of all the qualities that Make Dr, Henry Jones Jr. so memorable, the most accurate and powerful is: 'Cursed.' As a rule, a rigid regulation, no matter how noble his cause or how fearless his pursuit, nothing may ever ... EVER ... go right for Indiana Jones. That is why he is never boring. The circumstances that contsantly surround him are not just dire ... they are unnecessarily hopeless. They make Job look like Harvey Weinstein. In pursuit of two Arabs dressed in white who have placed Marion in a laundry basket to kidnap her, Indy happens upon a courtyard filled with nothing but Arabs dressed in white carrying laundry baskets;  After barely making it out of a booby trap infested tunnel alive with a priceless golden idol, he loses it to his rival and is chased away by hundreds of angry natives; Finally locating the resting place of the Lost Ark he lowers his torch only to find it is infested with snakes (and it couldn't have been spiders or crocodiles. It HAD to be snakes);  The most likely explanation of why he survives at the end of Raiders is that God gets tired of picking on him.It is for this reason that of all the people who had some part of the creation of Jones -- Harrison Ford's delivery  is incredible, Lawrence Kasdan did his finest work ever on this script -- The credit must go to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg who were both responsible for Indy's conception and the conception of all the painful, frightening and wonderful pitfalls he must undergo.As for the movie Itself I give it a 10 out of 10. thats all.",Null,0,0,3 May 2004
The Usual Suspects," flawless storytelling
","The Usual Suspects would have been a perfect crime film even if it wasn'tshrouded in mystery. It would have been a perfect character drama even if itwas about something other than organized crime. It would have been a perfectghost story if Kaiser Soze was not so absolutely alive. As it happens it is merely a perfect movie ... period. This film succeeds on every level it stands on. There is no weak link. Everycollaborator understood strength of the story and did their job better than they ever had or ever would again.Acting -- The Usual Suspects boasts the strongest acting performance a maleensemble in film history (Twelve Angry Men and Glengary Glenrossnotwithstanding). The five principles have an astounding grasp of theircharacters and the intricate details that make them so memorable. The'supporting players' right down to Hungarian burn victim serve the remarkably layered story as though they were the only ones who could tell it.
Directing -- Look in vain upon a second viewing for clues that will lead you to the climax's revelation. So painstakingly flawless is Bryan Singer's storytelling ability that with every twist comes apprehension: 'why didn't I see that coming?' you ask yourself. But Singer is not giving us merely a mystery with a surprise ending. He allows everything to build as the story goes on; along with thebuilding tension and the guessing is the mounting sense of almost apocalyptic doom that surrounds the characters. It oozes from every frame.Writing -- Christopher McQuarrie has revealed his obsession to be the innerstruggles of those dedicated to doing wrong. He does not give us charactersthat we can relate to but by God we WILL understand them. This is dialog in its purest form, not an extemporaneous syllable is spoken.
But it is all three of these aspects as well as the cinematography, music and editing which create the film's most outstanding effect. Throughout the film the mystery does not seem to be real. It is otherworldy, mythic. closer to Dante's Inferno than to The Maltese Falcon. From the very beginning the events seempart of a dark pattern. One put in motion by a force that no one knows is there but is leading each character into Hell. This force is entirely palpable from the first reel, before it is given a name. And that is a name that will live on in the memory of fictional film for as long as it exists.",Null,0,1,3 May 2004
