It," IT's uneven pacing and head scratching scenes ultimately cause it to fall short.
","I went into this movie expecting a darker horror movie about a kid killing clown. What I got was more a very uneven and strange film. A movie that transitions from dick jokes into creepy sexual dad/daughter vibes back into dick jokes then into a CGI ridden Pennywise scene. Making the movie come across uneven and messy in my opinion. It's as if they could not decide if they wanted a light hearted child driven adventure tale like 'The Goonies' or a dark child driven horror film like 'The Girl Next Door'. What the viewer gets is something in the middle that kind of had me leaving the theater saying 'meh'. As a horror fan and just a general fan of all movies I will not be returning to re-watch or recommend this movie. Also a side note the kids cleaning up a blood soaked bathroom only they can see in a lighthearted musical montage scene almost made me pack it in early, absolutely horrendous. I'm giving the movie a 6/10 because it has some laugh out loud moments and kept me entertained through out. Sadly it's not very scary but some of the Pennywise scenes are still a fun time.",6,15,28,12 September 2017
Midsommar," Strange Self Indulgent Film
","Midsommar brought to us by horror prodigy Ari Aster could have been so much more. Most people are familiar with Ari for his breakthrough film Hereditary. A good percentage of people (myself included) found that to be one of the best horror movies of the decade and were clamoring for Ari's next work. In comes Midsommar a sunny acid trip to Sweden. Right off the bat, the audience is treated to a sorrowful pitch black opening, that while serving its purpose left more to be desired.If you're reading this you know what Midsommar is about. We get a good hour of buildup before anything out of ordinary happens. Once that shockingly gruesome moment happens it's as if we've reached a crossroads. The director had a few different paths to take from there, and he took a more self-indulgent strange one.
Unsettling music, obtuse camera work, trippy visuals, long drawn out scenes, head-scratching moments, a disfigured child, comical quips (both intentional and unintentional) Midsommar is a messy mixed bag.This film could have been more than another beautiful to look at, but hollow art piece. Ultimately it's hard to call it anything more than that. We are left without explanations for some big things, some elements feel like they were thrown in for no real reason outside of being visually jarring, and a lot of this movie feels overlong and dragging. Often times taking itself way too seriously and feeling like it was trying too hard to be something it isn't. Characters felt empty, even given the long run time to aide in giving them more depth.Just as these types of movies usually do we have some allegories here. We don't, however, have much horror at all. The viewer gets occasional feelings of dread and despair, but this is more of a drama than anything else which I'm not faulting it for, the marketing would just have you think otherwise.I can see the appeal, and it wasn't horrible but Midsommar drops into some pitfalls that I can't forgive it for. I left the theater just wanting more ultimately unsatisfied with what I was given.",6,11,29,3 July 2019
The Disaster Artist," Hollow
","There was an odd buzz surrounding this film, that in my opinion was totally unmerited. It just scratches the surface of the story and embellishes some things. I'm someone who is not a fan of The Room because, well it's really bad. That being said I really wanted to see what Franco had to offer here as far as unpacking what the hell caused the debacle of a film. Really Disaster Artist was an empty look and borders on biography and parody. I found the end to be very very overdone and from what I know, entirely fabricated.",6,81,130,17 December 2017
Mother!," A shocking off the rails metaphorical art house film
","Wow mother! was a real wild ride. I stumbled out of the theater in awe. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. It is really nice to see directors like Darren Aronofsky take chances like this. What you get in mother! is one part drama one part horror six parts insanity. The story does not take any time at all to get going, it becomes completely crazy about an hour in and the final 20 minutes will leave you shocked. While I was not totally floored by either main stars performance the acting was surely great. The problem with mother! is, taken at face value it's totally ridiculous. The things that end up transpiring are absurd and over the top to say the least. Therefore mother! will surely be a polarizing movie. As a small example I went with 3 other people to see it, including myself it was a 50/50 love hate outcome. As far as the shocking moments in the film, they are a real doozy. There's one scene in particular that will certainly repel some people. In my theater of about 20 or so people a woman basically ran out during this part. When we left she was waiting outside visibly shaken and yelling at her boyfriend. For me as a person who loves it when films push the envelope and cross boundaries, I was delighted by it all. While mother! is the most audacious original movie of 2017 taken at face value it could be a real bust for some people. After reading into the meaning of the film I'd say I like it even more. I'm giving it an 8/10. A great movie.",8,48,99,14 September 2017
