Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An introduction and setup for some of the best movies ever!
",I have only seen this movie 4 times but i still love it. Darth Maul is DA MAN!! I hope there are more AWESOME characters in Episode II and III. The only problems with this movie is that Jar Jar Binks is in it and the Viceroy talks to funny. Jar Jar should not have been in it (i know that this movie was targeted towards a younger audience). The viceroy and the others like him should not have spoken in funky accents. They should have been speaking in their own language and they should have subtitled it like Jabba. >waited for Obi-Wan to slice him in half. He put up such an awesome battle . I still enjoyed this movie a lot but these things bugged me. That and they should have gotten a better kid to play anakin.,8,0,0,13 October 1999
The Usual Suspects," The BEST. Absolute BEST!
","A friend recommended this movie to me and i LOVED it. You can't get a better movie than this.Wonderful plot. Awesome acting. And to top it all off, an ending that will blow your mind! You'll be saying 'What the..!  HIM!!??'Basically, the movie is about a group of the 'usual suspects' who agree to do some money making schemes but end up learning they are all being watched by a man that they believed to be a myth, some of them still do.'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was convincing the world he didn't exist.'",Null,0,1,13 October 1999
