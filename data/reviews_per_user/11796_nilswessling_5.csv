Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It kills brain cells
","Starwars 1 is about the Trade federashion (the Trade federashion is like the Empior) They are attpenting to invade the planet of Naboo while 2 jedi Obi Wan Kenobi and Jwi Gon Jin (the keepers of the peace) travel to Naboo and are trying to take down the droid army of the Trade federashion. Star Wars 1 is the worst starwars movie so far. It has bad acting, even though there are great acters like ewan mcgreger,liam nesson and sammuel jackson. There terribal acting mainly coused by the really bad diolog that was writin by Gergio Lukes. The charecters are so so so badly writin your just waiting for all of them to die(in pain) There is.not one charcter where you can even build the smallest of connection. I dont reccomend this movie to any age group since it will kill brain cells and be a waste of time ANYWAY!!!",2,0,1,14 April 2019
The Death of Stalin," Its a dark comedy
","The death of Stalin is a dark but a very over exaggerated comedy about none other than the death of Stalin and how Russia reacted to there fallen leader. All of that has been put in a very well made brutal comedy,having a lot of jokes and showing Russia back in 1920s. I think a lot of people will enjoy this movie maybe except for little kids or even teenagers because they might not know whats going on since it does have a lot of jokes that are built on Russia and if you donÂ´t history very well the movie might get a bit boring after awhile. Also some little children might not like the movie since it has some swearing and in some ways it can also seem a bit brutal.I personally enjoyed the movie since you had a laugh ever 30 seconds or so. I thought the movie had a very old and dark style, i think that is mainly because those were dark times for Russia and it played a very long time ago.",8,1,1,14 April 2019
Ted," Inerpropret but funny
","Ted is a very entertaining movie!!! Although its not for every age group. its an R16 and its not surprising.It contains a lot of sexual,sexist.racist comments in the movie. It also shows the uses of drugs and contains a lot of swearing and sexual intercourse,but the political incorrectness of the movie makes it there for funny.Ted is a movie were a very inappropriate teddy bear comes to life and becomes best friends with a man called John.Ted is very family guy like, mainly because it has the same director Seth Macfarlane. The movie has pretty good acting since Mark Wahlberg is the main character of the movie.The movies main female character is Mila Kunis who plays Meg in family guy and the teddy bear is Seth MacFarlane himself. I recermend this movie to family guy watchers and anybody that loves politically uncorrect conntent.",7,0,2,14 April 2019
Some Like It Hot," Old but still funny to this day
","Some like it hot is a old classic movie from 1959. It may be black and white but that does not change the fact how funny this movie is. When I started watching this movie i thought what have i got myself into but then i realised the movie pact full of jokes that still land today. Some like it hot is about to men watch a murder happen in a ally way as the only witnesses they flew to Florida to play in a music band to hide from the gang members that did the murder. sadly the music band was only for girls so the 2 boys had to put make up on and dress up as girls to also enjoy the trip to Florida, but something they can not hide is there love for Suger the hot guitar player in the group. I think this is cuttable for all ages if you give it a go.",10,0,1,17 April 2019
Back to the Future," Great movie to go and see!!!
","Back to the future is a funny and action packet movie which is a perfect family sit down. A 17 year old teenager called Marty Mcfly goes back in time to 1955 and has to find away to get back to his year 1987. The movie is great for all ages since its a action comedy has no swearing,and no physical violence.I don't recommend it for kids that are under 6 years old cause they might get a bit confused, but what is great is that for some older people they might connect with a few things that happens to Marty in 1955 that will seem weird to the new generation which is all normal back then, but anyway the movie still is great it has great acting and voice play with the main characters being Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd who is also in Star Treck. The director Robert Zemeckis has done a great job in explaining the characters so you can build a bond between you and them. I really recommend this movie.",9,1,1,14 April 2019
