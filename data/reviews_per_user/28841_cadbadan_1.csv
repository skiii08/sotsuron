The New World," Better to be prepared before...
","It's not for sure a film in the way people are get used to. Wonderful images and use of camera that give very good sensations like being on the ship arriving in the new world. For the story I'd like to know deeper what message Mr.Malick want to transmit (natural man, society, religion...). Someone know where there are deeper informations?I read of someone that left cinema room before finishing or laughing at the end... In Italy, Roma, happen the same because people, don't knowing the director's story, is waiting a film of different speed (Like a version of Disney's Pocahontas!)In conclusion I suggest the film for photography, body communications of actors playing role of native American, Pocahontas in first position! And the more deep messages that I feel but I can't explain now...I hope in the future... (the Indian wizard at the end of film what is doing? I take my answer for later...)Ciao",8,3,8,21 January 2006
