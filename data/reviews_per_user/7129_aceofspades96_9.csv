The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Satisfyingly Surprising!
","First off I'd like to say that I have long been a fan of the hunger games books. I have read all three of them, and after reading this book, I despised it! The book just didn't have a satisfying plot for me and no real suspense. But enough about book reviews, this is a movie review. I mention my disgust for the book because I went into the theater ready to hate the movie. I thought it was going to be the same plot with the same old characters, and I was going to be disappointed plus out 18 dollars for paying for my other critiquing buddy.I am glad to say that I was wrong! Wow! I'm not going to lie, but this movie blew me away! Usually books based off of the movie have a lot of details left out of the final product. I guess you can say that the book is always better than the movie. This movie disproves that rule! There is actually more detail and more feelings in this movie than what was in the book.Now obviously they can't keep every detail the same as the book, but they did a great job compensating for what they couldn't do, for they could do. In the book you are just thrown into district 12 ruins and you don't have a clue why Katniss is even there in the first place. In this movie, she wakes up in the hospital and is suffering from her recurrent nightmares again. She hasn't seen the ruins of district 12 or doesn't have any idea how many people died. This gives her the fuel to become the mocking jay for the rebellion. In the book she just does because she wants to get peeta back. Jennifer Lawrence does a stupendous job of giving the feeling of being petrified when she sees the ruins in district 12. You feel the exact way Katniss would if you saw what she saw!For the first time ever, the writers are giving the people who actually read the books a treat when they watch this movie. The first being something small, but still satisfying. The cat! You never really get the vibe of how much she hates that Cat in the previous two movies. In the book she hates the cat to death and she wanted it to die. Half of the audience laughed when they saw the cat, and half didn't. The second treat you get from the producers is the hanging tree song. In the movie it is just a song that she sang from the top of her head and all the districts sang it but not the capital. In the book, it goes so much further than that. People who don't read the book don't know that her father was a great singer and that her dad would sing that song to her. The song gave you chills when you heard it and it made you honk so harshly about her dad.The movie does a great job with staying true to the book while adding adjustments to make the story better. The book is from Katniss' perspective making what happens in the other districts unknown unless she is told. There is a lot of boring talking that happens in the book before any real action goes on because of this. This goes for the rebellion at the dam, the forest, or even the tribute rescue mission. Katniss simply doesn't know what goes on. The producers got to cheat with this and show you what really happens alleviating a lot of the boring filler pain from the book. There was true suspense and even boom readers didn't know what was going to happen at times!This isn't something that I can really use to promote seeing this movie, but I will say that my perception and image in my mind was damn near identical to what the film crew put together. I was amazed on how the hospital looked! I figured it was like they were taking my mind and putting it on screen!I will say that they fell short on making peeta look different after every time you see him on TV. Katniss kept saying his voice sounded different and that he looked different, and she was worried what they were doing to him. He didn't look any different. And I didn't see why she was flipping out.This is either Juliane Moore's fault or the directors fault, but the character of Coin was not the same as it was supposed to be. Coin is more sinister, and not fully understood in the book, while in the movie, she is very well respected and she's kind of a badass! You can't help but like her. I don't want to like her because of what she does to.... I guess I'll save that :)The movie does a great job of creating this feeling of helplessness and suspense. The best example is when the capital bombs district 13. You panic just as much as the citizens do when you see the citizens, and when the shot changes to Coin, you are pretty much begging them to do something about it. You feel so helpless when they realize that all they can do is wait it out.Overall I give it a 9/10 for how good a movie this is! The acting was great, the cgi was great, the the music was great, and it's loyalty to the boom was great! I take one star off to the mess up with the makeup on peeta, and the wrong portrayal of Coin. Other than that this is by far the best hunger games movie to date, and I would recommend this movie to anyone!",6,20,55,21 November 2014
The Hateful Eight," Just sit down, and enjoy the movie!!!!
","Right off the bat, I'll go ahead and say that this is unlike any other movie that I've seen before. This truly was a masterpiece of a film! No director handles dialogue quite the way that Tarantino does. This review will be a spoiler-free review of what to expect of this film.First and foremost, do NOT listen to negativity that you hear on a lot of film sites. The negativity in the film can most be attributed to the fact that Tarantino made a very controversial comment about the NYPD saying that they are all murderers. This gave a lot of former fans of Tarantino a negative and unfair bias of people who are now going into this film to hate it. Put aside your biases, forget that this movie is a Tarantino film. Go into the movie theater with a positive attitude, and be ready to be amazed. First off, the dialogue in the movie is utterly fantastic! Each character has his or her own dialects and ways of speaking that are each unique to each other. For instance, the southern sheriff has a different way of speaking than a retired war-veteran does. This is captured perfectly in the lines of the people just by the way they speak. It really creates a diverse atmosphere in the film and really shows the difference in characters. Again with the dialogue, the writer spends as much time as he can putting in subtle exposition-dialogue so the audience can really understand who and what the characters are. He doesn't do this through constant monologues or any other form of cliché per-se. He does this through funny arguments, and simple conversations. Sure the build-up to the climax is very long, and may seem slow, but this is definitely okay in the fact that we fully understand who are characters are. This was definitely not some cheap screenplay that a movie studio purchased from a back-door writer. This is a high-quality well- written masterpiece. The plot of the film is ingeniously planned out and subtly foreshadowed at the beginning of the film. There are lots of subtle things that we as the audience see thinking nothing of, but actually have bigger meaning than one might think. There are lots of subtle details that we may not notice, but will be brought to our attention by a character. I thought that the writer really showed that he had everything in mind already played out, and wasn't just writing as he went along. I love the fact that the writer really adds an 'everything happens for a reason' kind of tone to the movie. This is not your typical western with a typical dueling cowboy soundtrack. The soundtrack of the film sounded very ominous and fit the overall tone of the movie perfectly. Tarantino used this film to his advantage tons of times in the film. He did this especially well in a sequence of the raging blizzard outside; the ominous organ is blaring in our ears and only gets louder when the wind blows harder. Then all of sudden, the shot quickly changes to indoors where it's calmer and warmer. The change from the soundtrack felt like a snap of a finger, and the writer used this masterfully. Just like Jaws, this film has it's own special sinister score that shows when danger is near, and I personally believe that this score should be just as iconic.Man oh man! The acting was just perfect in the film. Every character was played perfectly by an awesome ensemble cast. These faces are very familiar to fans of QT films. As I said before, each character had different dialects. Not only was the overall tone of the characters masterfully shown in the movie, but the manner of speaking felt very authentic. Frequent QT actor Samuel Jackson played his role perfectly. I figured since this is his 2nd western movie with QT and his 6th movie with QT as well, he'd show a bit of other characters that he played in his movie. However, this was simply not the case. He showed no trace of his other characters and masterfully acted in this film. The character that he plays was suited perfectly for him, and I feel like even Samuel L. Jackson as well as the rest of the ensemble cast loved their characters. Again as I said before, do not go into this film wanting to hate it. Go into the film with a positive attitude and just sit down and enjoy the damn movie. Who cares about what Tarantino said, who cares about any controversial statements he might have made. As we saw in all of his other movies, Tarantino is a very controversial man, and should just be given to his credit on screen rather than in person. Focus on the awesome dialogue, acting, and overall great film itself! Go out and see it! You will not be disappointed. P.S. I very rarely rate movies a full 10.",10,20,57,30 December 2015
The Revenant," Eye Candy, but Still Meh...
","Right off of the bat, I'd like to say that the film has some of the absolute BEST cinematography I've ever seen. I don't know how the producers managed to get so many long-shots in there. There are literally shots that will last 5 minutes without cutting in between. This is especially true at the beginning. If anything, this film should definitely receive tons of praise for its cinematography alone. Hand-in-hand with the cinematography are the visual effects. Next to the Martian, this film has some of the best visual effects that I've seen this year. This is especially true with the bear mauling scene. The bear literally looks real, and the manage to generate drool coming from its mouth and landing on Leo's forehead, however, the bear was never there in the first place. The effects looked gorgeous, and I really enjoyed seeing them on the big screen. However, despite the great visual effects, and the stellar cinematography, the film just wasn't up to my expectations. When I saw that this film had 4 golden globe awards including best acting, I truly expected to see a breath taking performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, but I was greatly disappointed. Sure he did great job of acting like he was in pain, and acting like he couldn't talk, however, this is nothing that we haven't seen before. Even in low- budget films, we see acting of a similar caliber where people are suffering for their roles. There simply just wasn't enough lines for Leo to peak our interests or to really steal the show. Leo spends most of his time on screen grunting, screaming, and breathing super heavily. I'm sure that any other trained Hollywood actor could pull this off too; his performance was very bland.The other actors seemed very one-dimensional. There were some great actors in this cast: Tom Hardy, Leo DiCaprio, Domhnall Gleeson, however, I feel like the director spent most of his time on capturing the environment rather than the actors of the film. Throughout the film, I feel like the acting was done in one take. From the beginning with the dispute between Glass and Fitzgerald, to the scene with Fitzgerald and Glass' son. The performances given just seemed so rushed, and I know for a fact the actors can do better. The director for whatever odd reason liked to put slow-motion in areas that didn't need slow-motion. This is really shown in transitions back into the wild. The running time is 156 minutes, and could have been trimmed down to 140 minutes by getting rid of all of the unnecessary slow-motion. Minute after minute, we see nothing but trees. Trees and the moon. This really doesn't do anything for the audience but remind us that we are in the cold weather. Which was kind of implied anyways.Overall, the film was visually appealing, but the acting was not great. The talent in this movie was very much skimped for the excellent cinematography and effects. The film was fun to watch, but nothing ground-breaking, and unfortunately for his fans, I don't see Leo getting his Oscar from this film.",7,3,8,5 January 2016
Dunkirk," Elegantly shot, yet lacking character development.
","A rather unfair notion moviegoers have about Christopher Nolan is that every movie he creates must be instant classics. This notion is unfair mainly because no writer on the face of the earth constantly pumps out classic after classic. While I will agree that Nolan has a beautiful resume under his belt(as well as being my favorite filmmaker), he is only human, and is not perfect.After seeing screen writing paradigms like Memento, Inception, and Interstellar, I fell in love with the characters that Nolan has created. I went into Dunkirk expecting to fall in love with a new set of characters all over again. Dunkirk just didn't deliver any form of character development at all. Unfortunately for Nolan fans, there is no main character for this film. Some actors get more screen time than others, however, the jury is still out on exactly who the story's perspective is told. However, the perspective changes 3 times, and in very rapid succession. We see either a young infantrymen, a trained pilot, or a group of civilians attempting to evacuate Dunkirk. These all sound like excellent ideas for characters, however, we know nothing about these people. Nolan did a fantastic job of making every moment of the movie have some sort of suspense. You were always on the edge of your seat hoping the worst wouldn't happen. However, I feel like the movie did a GROSS disservice to itself by lacking character development. A movie that is written to be this suspenseful should go hand in hand with amazing characters we hope don't die. Except, what we get is a very watered down attempt at suspense, and it really leaves a lot to be desired from the screen writing. For instance, Tom Hardy played a pilot in the Royal Air Force. Seeing him shoot down enemy planes with ease was very satisfying, however, at the end, when we see him captured by German soldiers, we have absolutely no clue why he purposely did that to himself. In fact, we know nothing about the man. All we know is that he is a damn pilot. What's even worse is that Tom Harry's character is a huge plot driver. To make such big plot decisions based off of characters who we know nothing about is very frustrating and overall a very cheap way to write a film.While the film's plot leaves much to be desired, Nolan absolutely nailed the cinematography and effects. Christopher Nolan is the absolute master of practical effects, and you can really see the difference on the screen. I found myself drooling at some of the shots in this film. Some of the shots in this film last for 15-25 seconds all by themselves. It is no joke when I say that one of the best shots in cinema history is when Tom Hardy is flying, and the camera follows the plane. You can see the entire city of Dunkirk France in the background. This was an absolutely gorgeous shot, as well as many others. The action sequences in the film absolutely blew me away too. Right from the very beginning, the film's action sequences sounded, felt, and looked so close to real, I almost thought I was there myself. Being a long time fan of Christopher Nolan, I have to say that I am disappointed in this film. Again, I would never have thought that a polished writer like Nolan would ever have a problem with character development. However, this is not the worst Christopher Nolan film to date, and is definitely better than Insomnia(not that that's saying anything).",7,2,3,9 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Please ignore the abysmal fanbase, this is an original story that works well
","I really enjoyed this rendition of Star Wars. Keep in mind, I try to go into every movie very very optimistically. I like to be as subjective to the film as possible, because I think it really gets the reader thinking about their thoughts. This is a very good Star Wars movie, and it definitely deserves praise. This is not to say it's without its faults; there are things wrong with this movie that simply cannot be ignored. However overall, I thought the movie was an eye candy success. I thought that the plot was very thought-provoking and well put together. One thing I've always appreciated about Disney is how their films always have a moral message behind them. For instance, in Pixar's(owned by Disney) Toy Story, the overall theme of the series was to take life slowly, and live in the moment because one day we will miss all of the things we did before. A Bug's Life showed us that you can be different, as long as you be yourself, and you'll come through in the end. How does this pertain to Star Wars? The overall theme in the movie was failure teaching us to be better. Most people associate failure with shame, and unhappiness, but this movie shows us that failure is inevitable. The film is loaded with red(more on that later). Red is obviously a symbol for failure in this movie. Snoke's throne room was loaded with red; this is important because all critical scenes that happen in this room discuss failure. Ben failed Snoke when he couldn't defeat Rei. Smoke failed to see who Ben's true enemy was. Rei failed in redeeming Ben . All of these scenes happen in this room, and the room is literally covered in red. Even in the chase through the caves in the Millennium falcon are shot in this overwhelming red hue. We see red symbolizing failure again in the final act where Finn and the last of the resistance are trying to destroy the door cannon. There is no coincidence that white salt setting leaves a red trace when it's disturbed. The trails of the gliders leave a red mist as they move. However, despite all of the resistence's clear and valiant efforts, they fail to destroy the canon. After the door is destroyed, and The First Order is about to ransack the base, you can see all of the overturned red salt. Although extremely gorgeous, this scene showcases all of the resistance's failures. It resembled a bloody battle that had been lost. However, what ends up saving them was coming to terms from them and learning from them. 'Failure is the greatest teacher.' I think the ending of the little boy who is presumable a Jedi, was a fantastic way to show off how the galaxy will hear of the failures; they will see these failures, but at the end of the day, they are still there. There is still something to fight for, stil something to learn, still something worth being. The aesthetics in the film were top notch. The CGI looked beautiful! A lot of the film is shot in space, so naturally there are a lot of space battles. You can almost drool at the way the fighters and X-Wings looked in mid fight. The set was dashing with color, and the sounds were so nostalgic yet so new at the same time. However, it's not the CGI that amazed me. What amazed me were the practical effects. Rian Johnson created his own piece of the Star Wars universe and did so in such a grand scale. The entire casino on the distant planet was all practical. China sets, puppets, chips, tables, slots, golden staircases. All of these were made with great care and amazing tact. However, nothing will beat the amazing costumes in this film. The costumes were all practical, and looked gorgeous. The red guard, the casino police, storm troopers, captain phasma, all practical, all real. Not to mention that simple things such as rifles and blasters are all practical props. All of the droids are practical too. The films aesthetics are the absolute best ever made in a Star Wars film.I thought overall, our main characters are very well developed. This is especially true when looking at Kyle Ren. He is a very complex character which makes it really difficult to see what he truly stands for as a character. I loved/hated that the main villain changes in such a tragic and dramatic way. I feel like it really took Kylo Ren's status of a secondary villain to a primary villain. His ascent to the supreme leader status was definitely given a proper catalyst for his future character. I thought the chemistry between Rai and Ben was very believable and something we didn't really expect. Whether the atrocious fanbase of Star Wars wants to admit it, the two characters are connected. Both of whom have shoddy relationships with their parents, both have mentors who have taught them the ways of the force, both of them have a loyal military force at their back, and most of all, both of them are conflicted with themseleves. The two characters both form a methaphorical yin-yang. Rey, this seemingly innocent young girl trying to learn the ways of the force is not at all shocked by her experience with the dark side of the force. I enjoy how this character which is supposed to be from the good side is shown toying with the dark side of the force without hesitation. Kylo Ren, this seemingly evil member of the most evil force in the universe is shown having conflict with the humanity in himself. We see him refuse to kill his mother, lie to General Hux about who really killed Snoke, save Rey's life. While this character is shrouded in darkness, we do see some of the light in him. And I thought that this balance of what is good and what is bad between these two characters did tons of justice for character development in this new trilogy.While the film was overall a success in my eyes, I have to say that there are parts of the film that leave much to be desired. While this may seem unfair to judge this film as part of the trilogy rather than its own film, I will lay judgment down to the fact that this new trilogy creates tons of false hype for its characters. The first example of this has to be Snoke. The Force Awakens introduces Snoke to the trilogy as this supreme evil which is more powerful than anything in the universe. The Force Awakens had me feeling that Snoke was going to be a pivotal character in the series. While the argument can be made that he still is s pivotal character, he is in all the wrong ways. What could have been the most amazing villain in Star Wars history is lost in a bland and very predictable way. I feel like a lot of the hype that was made towards Snoke was very ill-made and the story gives viewers an accidental middle finger in the way that he died. Andy Serkis played the role so well, and it's a shame that he probably won't be returning to the role of Snoke. Disney humor is very distinct. It's hard to explain exactly what Disney humor is, but once you see it, you know it. I feel like there were a lot of blatant attempts at humor that simply don't work and obviously aimed at children. The first example of this was in the beginning of the film where Poe is talking to General Hux via radio. I feel that Poe pretending to not be able to hear Hux was so cliche; it was an overused trope we've seen in so many different films. If Rian Johnson was attempting to make us laugh at this, he failed in epic proportions.Look I get it. Disney owns the Star Wars universe now. And I understand that Disney wants to show us more of this ginormous universe. However, this doesn't mean that you can throw in random strange-looking creatures just for the sake of showing strange-looking creatures. I remember seeing the very first trailer for this film and thinking to myself that the creatures might be an a zealous issue, and j was exactly right. Throwing in random creatures serves no purpose than to show off to the world that this is MY universe, and I want there to be random giants with nipples that give me milk, and why not throw in a random musk that comes from their head? While we're at it, why don't we just throw these random birds all over the place that serve no purpose to the plot other than to take up screen place. Here are some crystal foxes too. I'm not sure why the film spent so much time showing these random creatures, but I don't think anyone was impressed.Lastly, I want to touch on Leia Organa. I have to cut this producers some slack for not expecting Carrie Fisher to unfortunately die too young. However, I just don't see what her real purpose was in this film. She offered no theme-building ideologies, she had lackluster screentime, and she was given pretentious glamor in the script. For a general in charge of an entire fleet and battalion of resistence warriors, she was not given any proper character development. To be quite honest, I thought that Carrie Fisher's performance was her weakest yet. I thought her lines were delivered very cheasily, and the directors made her only sound like she was a cranky woman. This is the woman we've seen fight through an entire rebellion before, and she was given no justice to her former character. I am very ashamed to see such an amazing character have such a bland and anticlimactic end. Guys despite its obvious flaws, this is a good Star Wars movie. I don't know what it's going to take for people to see that their fanbase is not sacred and democratic. This fanbase has done more damage to Star Wars than any writer ever could. This film isn't the original trilogy. Even the first film of this new trilogy, a film that directly modeled the very first Star Wars movie ever written doesn't shine like the original movies do. They never will. Stop trying to think that they will. See this film for what it is: an original storyline that works well.",8,0,4,17 December 2017
Finding Dory," A heart-wrenching story of a fish... I'm serious.
","Finding dory was a great, fun, and emotional journey from start to finish. While the film is definitely aimed at family audiences in 2016, the people who grew up watching Finding Nemo when they were younger will definitely appreciate this film as much as everyone else. Pixar for the most part stayed true to the original film. We obviously have the same characters, the same actors (except for one) and the same overall universe. Pixar did a great job of connecting the dots between the two movies. Some of the same scores from the last film. For instance in the last film when Marin followed the boat, the same score is used when we see Dory's perspective of how the two met. It's a nice little touch, and it really shows how much detail the writers went into creating the character. It really is a puzzle how Pixar manages to create these visually stunning animated films every year. The picture was great! Really tiny details such as dust particles, or individual grains of sand, and other fine touches really add to the great depth the animators went into making the film from the ground up. As usual, Pixar had very little flaws in their work. I felt like Nemo was poorly used. Sure they make references to the other films, but it's the way Nemo says things to his dad that anger me. For instance, Nemo tried to tell Marlin he should trust people because he keeps making him feel like they can't do it. And then they just drop it there, and don't say anything about it again. For the second time in my life, I had the joy of being able to go see a Pixar film. This, and Tou Story 3 are the only two Pixar movies I've ever seen in a theatre. And I'll go ahead and say that I love Pixar's work even better on the big screen. Truly a sequel worth seeing, and a sequel that everyone should love.",7,2,13,19 June 2016
The Sixth Sense," Good movie, but not ingenious.
","I had a good time watching this film. It had a good plot, and the acting was definitive. This and signs, which will come out two years after this film, are the only two shyamalan films that have impressed me. The plot summed up is that an impeccable child psychologist is gunned down by one of his old patients. A year later, the psychologist appears to have made a full recovery. He meets an emotionally unstable boy, who appears to have a few mental, and social problems. After meeting the boy, he learns that he has a secret dark gift: he is able to see dead people.The acting was great. For being only 11 years old in this film, Haley Joel Osment did a fantastic job portraying an outcast, who is terrified of his own shadow. Definitely one of the more talented child actors of this era in film. Bruce Willis did a fantastic job of playing a workaholic psychologist, who is in some marital problems. His reaction to the uncovered secret at the end of the film was almost perfect, until after he calmed down. That one scene ruined his performance for almost the entire movie.The cinematography was up to par, but up to par only. It really wasn't anything game changing, or ground breaking. These are the old cinematic tricks, and I feel that these are the only thing that Shyamalan knows. Close ups, hand helds, and gods eyes over and over again. It was done well with what he had, but it was really bland after a while. Considering most people don't watch a movie for its cinematography, I can't really take off a star for that.The writing. Okay here we go. Some of you may hate me, some of you may love me. This is 16 years after the film was released. I will say that for the time, this was a good plot twist and almost something new. Just because the famous plot twist at the end was new, doesn't mean it was good. It really was kind of expected and didn't surprise me at all. We see a lot of clichés in this movie. Single mom with two jobs, emotionally unstable social outcast with a secret gift, workaholic with marriage problems, bully who is superior in every way ends up being the outcast in the end, and so on. It's fine that he uses them in his writing, but they just don't impress anyone in the end. Oh here we go again! The elephant in the room. The ending. The plot twist at the end. He was dead all along! Gasp!* but not really. Yes it was clever for him to be dead the whole time, but he made the clues too obvious. He never talks to anyone, his wife never makes eye contact, he almost always wears the same clothes, nobody acknowledges he's even there. I mean for gods sake, the dude was shot in his kidney. You pretty much knew he was dead when Cole said he saw dead people. The twist was delivered horribly as well. The ring falls on the floor. okay? So she had his ring? Who talks in their sleep like that anyways? You're telling me that in all the time that he spent away from his wife, he didn't notice that everybody was ignoring him? Nobody heard a kid talking to air since normal people can't see ghosts? This is a very noteworthy paradox that nobody seems to address. Why didn't the boy tell him that he was dead? Surely he could see that the counselor was dead, so why didn't he tell him? Why wasn't he afraid? Why was he scared when he said he was getting a new counselor? He wasn't talking to a counselor in real life anyways. Another thing, is this seriously the only case that a child psychologist deals with? You see at the beginning, he has a folder full of cases, and this is the only one he is dealing with?Overall, I think the movie was a very creative, very fun ride from start to finish. I just see lots of plot holes. This was a great film for its time, but to me, this film is not something that I will remember forever, and it is not staple in film. For the repeated plot holes, and poor clichés, I take off 3 stars.",7,1,4,12 March 2015
Spectre," Good Close To Craig Era
","For those of you who haven't seen this film yet, I urge you to go out and see it. Definitely a great close to the Craig Era. Craig definitely has suited Bond well in the entire franchise, and he's done it yet again in this one too. However, it wasn't anywhere near as good as Skyfall or Casino Royale. I know it says 8/10, but I really would like to give it a 7.5/10Basically, Bond gets a message from a special someone, who gives him a lead on an unknown suspect. Bond travels to Mexico to discover a trace of a sinister organization, and is shocked by what he finds. Acting was great. Nobody seemed fake or anything like that; expect the usual characters, and positions as well as titles. Ralph Fiennes does a great job of playing the head of MI6. He just has this way of seeming so professional, and staying so calm. Daniel Craig does such a good job of playing Bond. Each actor who plays bond has their own taste, and Craig plays Bond like a bad-ass skilled guy who loves his job. The plot of the film was fairly decent, however I feel like they could have spent more time adding onto the back-story of the villains. They kind of just, appear, and they don't really add anything to the plot that wasn't already there to begin with. I'm glad that they offer tie-ins to the former films, but they just don't coincide like they should. It kind of feels forced the way they added the 'final' villain into the mix.The way the plot was set up was also forced as well. They barely talk about how Bond was given his leads, and so on. As for the other villains, some of them don't really speak, but give off this vibe that I want to like them, but I just can't because I don't know anything about them. Also, this is one of the only Bond films where Bond is on his own. You'll see what I mean by that, but for now, just know that MI6 is not going to be helping Bond like they should. What the film does do good of, is keeping the characters the same. The tone of the characters have stayed almost identical to what it was in almost all of the other films. Money penny is still a really cool secretary, Bond is still bad-ass, Q is hilarious, and so on. So be prepared to see your old characters back on the screen again. Visual effects were great! Nothing looked CGI; of course I don't know, but I have a feeling that everything was shot on camera, and very little CGI was used in the making of this movie. Explosions look awesome, and sound awesome. Gun fights are very much up to par; coupled with gun fights, the fight scenes are very well choreographed, and leave us on the edge of our seats wondering who will win. Overall, I'd say it was a good film, and I urge you all to go see it. Not as good as its predecessors, but still very much worth a viewing. Acting was great, visual effects were amazing, and the fight scenes were pulse-pounding. Just expect a tiny bit of a week character development. But other than that guys, I very much urge you to see the movie.",8,10,29,5 November 2015
The Martian," A definitive, eye candy success!
","The Martian was a great, fun science fiction staple in Ridley Scott's career. Of all genres of films that he's tried, this one was definitely spot on where it needed to be. Visuals were great, acting was very warm, and appealing to the audience. In short, the film is about an astronaut stranded on mars with almost no way of contact top earth.Be prepared to have your mind positively blown by the visual effects in this film. This film takes the effects in Gravity, shuts them off, and tears the switch off. The setting literally looks like mars. A perfect red sky, red desolate sand, and lots and lots of red barren mountains. Zero gravity in the film is practically flawless, however Scott is really picky and choosy with Martian gravity which is about a third of earth. One aspect of gravity effects that was rather impressive was the shift from zero gravity, to earth gravity all on the same ship. Nothing like that has been done before.Scott was for the most part pretty solid on keeping the science reasonable. The facts about the martian soil were correct, the rocket science was pretty much correct, so expect to be even more amazed that a lot of what happens in the film is pretty much possible! However, the time delay for radio signals would be about a half an hour, and that was pretty much ignored in the film.The film had an all star cast. Matt Damon did a fantastic job playing an astronaut scientist who knows what he's doing, and can keep both his sanity, and his sense of humor even though he could die at any moment. A good actor knows how to make every character different than the other he played, and Matt Damon showed no trace of his previous roles, and carried out his own phenomenally. Be prepared to fall in love with Damon's performance.The plot was very linear, and was super easy to follow. The screenplay wrote enough not to make obvious exposition lines, but also made it clear to the audience what was going on. The screenwriter didn't just throw you into the dark and expected you to make sense of the universe on your own. cough* Christopher Nolan. However, he used way too many sour jabs at humor. There were so many pointless jokes and gags that made the plot seem less serious. It really takes away from the suspense. Definitely go see the film. Definitely worth seeing in theaters. Be prepared for a fun, epic joy ride from start to finish.",9,11,57,4 October 2015
