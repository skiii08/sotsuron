The New World," Don't waste your money!
","Well, This is just my opinion, but I got this movie this weekend based on all the good reviews I had heard about it. I have to agree with the original poster. I love movies and can appreciate different styles by different directors, but this movie was sooooooo boring. The acting I thought was very well done, but how much running thru the grass do you need before we get the idea that they are in love. A little dialog once in awhile wouldn't have hurt either. You have two amazing actors in Colin Farrell and Christian Bale and they were woefully under-used. I know the story of John Smith and Pocohontas and I was still lost a few times in the story. Hearing so many good reviews about this movie reminds me of all the so called 'art critics' who will give the most glowing reviews of the crappiest artwork because someone, somewhere told them they should. So rather than using their own eyes, they give the review expected of them. So yes, if you asked me was this movie beautiful I would respond yes, however a movie is supposed to tell a story, you are supposed to get a feel for the characters, but without the dialog this one just falls short.",3,1,4,19 June 2006
