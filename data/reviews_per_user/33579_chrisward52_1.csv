United 93,911,"I saw this film today and it was a shocking, brilliant piece of film making. I don't really have anything more to say about it - see it for yourself. Questions I'd pose to people about 911 are:1)When Bush was first told about the attacks why did he continue to read to the kids class for another 7 minutes? did the secret service know something we didn't? 2)why did the terrorists attack between 8-9 am when the buildings where mostly empty? 11 am and each building would have had had 20,000 people in them. 3)Why did the terrorists chose to fly into the toughened side of the Pentagon when the roof would have been much softer to fly through? 4)Where are remains of the aircraft that hit the pentagon and the pictures of this 747 sticking out the side? 5)Wire framed buildings have not historically fallen down due to fire. Didn't the collapse of the towers look sooooo like a controlled demolition? 6)Why has Rumsbvelt got 3 different versions of what he did immediately after the attack? 7)Was United 93 actually shot down? 8)Why did all the normal protocols for incepting planes that communication is lost with not kick in that day. Were they turned off? 9)Who benefited from giving the Bush administration reason to go into the middle east? A 2001 'Pearl Harbor' so to speak? 10) Why has the Bush government dragged its feet on *every* issue that might lead to a thorough investigation of what happened that day?chase the answers for yourselves people",9,3,6,15 July 2006
