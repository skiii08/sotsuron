Vertigo," Exquisite piece of work.
","This overly analyzed, thoroughly absorbing thriller is a strong candidate for Hitchcock's finest cinematic achievement ('Rear Window' being the closest competitor). The pace may feel painfully slow by today's standards, but multiple viewings really make you appreciate the magnificence of this enchanting, visually polished masterpiece. Bernard Herrmann's hypnotic score crowns the experience.",10,2,4,11 March 2001
Casablanca," Not as great a classic as it's chalked up to be...
","I usually love old classics, but I have never understood the appeal of this film. It's not a bad movie by any stretch; it's just a rather pedestrian one if you ask me.When I first saw 'Casablanca', the opening minutes felt bizarre and had me wondering if I was watching the right movie. Ingrid Bergman's enchanting performance is probably the best thing in the entire film, although the Ilsa Lund character is hardly one of her best roles. Claude Rains was superb, whereas Paul Henreid was totally bland and completely forgettable. To sum it up, 'Casablanca' is watchable, but it has no place in my 'Greatest movies of all time' list.",6,3,9,29 November 2001
North by Northwest," A real gem of the genre
","'North by Northwest' is easily Hitchcock's most entertaining movie, although 'The Lady Vanishes' comes close. What makes it so enjoyable is that it's filled with incomparably tingling plot twists and humorous touches. Don't think too much about logic, it will spoil the wonderful experience of watching this film. Certainly one of Hitchcock's biggest triumphs.",10,1,2,25 September 2000
Mission: Impossible," Quite enjoyable.
","'Mission: Impossible' is a refreshing film to watch; an energetic, stylishly directed thriller with imaginative camera work and sharp editing. It starts with an exciting build-up set in Prague and doesn't become dull at any point, thanks to the complexity of the plot. The most impressive and memorable part of the film is undoubtly the incredibly tense and elaborate scene in which Tom Cruise breaks into the computer room. Too bad they had to make the ending climax so over-blown. Despite that completely absurd (even though visually dashing) sequence, I enjoyed the movie quite a lot.",9,2,3,22 February 2001
Where Eagles Dare," Disappointingly mediocre adventure flick
","Too many plot twists, pretty bad special effects, nearly painful overlength. Despite these weaknesses, 'Where Eagles Dare' is not a bad film. But it's disappointingly mediocre, especially compared to another Alistair MacLean adaption 'The Guns of Navarone', which is a near-masterpiece. But like I said, this isn't a bad movie. See what you think of it.",7,2,5,7 September 2000
The Untouchables," Had the potential, but failed.
","The Untouchables seems promising enough; being directed by Brian De Palma, involving a cast that includes Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro and Sean Connery...Unfortunately it's marred by too many totally implausible scenes that make the film almost laughable (see it yourself) and its violence quota is a bit heavy for my taste. One of the biggest mistakes is using a horribly out of place music in the bridge shootout, making the sequence a perfect turn off. The film does have spectacular appearances, however.",6,0,3,5 August 2001
Psycho," Remarkable.
","When Saul Bass' opening credits begin to roll (combined with Bernard Herrmann's legendary score), you know you're in for a treat. However, the first half an hour of 'Psycho' can get slightly tedious as it mostly consists of Janet Leigh driving a car. But as soon as she reaches The Bates Motel, the atmosphere increases to an electrifying level.
'Psycho' made an enormous impression on me the first time I saw it (I was just 12). Luckily I had no idea about the twist in the end because it would have ruined the whole thing. Although the movie relies much on Hitchcock's innovative use of clever camera angles, its greatest asset is Anthony Perkins' outstanding performance that simply cannot be praised enough.
As some others have pointed out, the casting of John Gavin as Leigh's boyfriend was a terrible choice, but I believe Hitchcock wasn't very pleased with him either. Gavin's practically nonexistent screen appeal reminds me of those anemic actors in 'Strangers on a Train'. Can't believe he was to become the new James Bond until Sean Connery was lured back, thankfully!Regardless of that minor flaw, 'Psycho' has earned its status in the history of cinema. It's a remarkable achievement within Hitchcock's career and an impressive work of art whose impact multiple viewings can't wear off.",10,1,4,1 July 2001
Speed," Topnotch genre flick.
","It's hard to find a more compelling, thrilling, as well as entertaining action package than 'Speed'. The plot is a simple yet an ingenious and effective way to create nonstop action without too much of unnecessary violence. Keanu Reeves does actually a pretty good job and the chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock is enviable, while Dennis Hopper makes for a convincing lunatic. Although the suspense level is thick all the way through, the film feels a bit too long. Regardless of that, 'Speed' may very well be the best representer of its genre.",9,0,0,13 February 2001
Rear Window," Sheer brilliance of film making
","I believe most Hitchcock buffs consider 'Rear Window' the director's best accomplishment. And why not, although 'Vertigo' is a serious competitor. 'North by Northwest' is my favourite Hitchcock film, but I think it's 'Rear Window' that proves his mastery perhaps most perfectly.Aside from being a highly enjoyable murder mystery, 'Rear Window' plays like a lesson on film making. Even though when you're familiar with the plot, you can still watch the movie over and over again, admiring how brilliantly it's put together. Elaborate camera work compounded with flawless editing - simply marvellous.John Michael Hayes' script - containing interesting, lively dialogue - is downright delicious; one of the best Hitchcock worked with, not to mention the excellent cast. James Stewart and Grace Kelly are fantastic, and Thelma Ritter adds plenty of comic relief.In a way I can understand some people who say 'Rear Window' is boring. Occasionally it may seem a bit sluggish, because nowadays' audiences are used to much quicker pacing. But when Stewart makes Kelly to believe his murder theory, the story gains momentum at a stroke. From there forward, it's topnotch thrilling all the way to the tingling climax.",10,2,5,20 December 2000
Saboteur," Mediocre Hitchcock
","In my opinion, this lesser Hitchcock film isn't a great example of the master's work. It's fairly entertaining but mediocre; not up to 'The 39 Steps' or 'North by Northwest'. Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane don't have too much appeal, but the other actors are very good. The second half of the film is much better than the first one, which includes some pretty foolish scenes (the travelling circus).",7,0,2,15 September 2000
The Birds," Technically brilliant, inconsistent Hitchcock thriller
","'The Birds' truly shows Hitchcock's directing skills. He builds up suspense very effectively, and the film is technically (camera work, editing, sound effects, etc.) brilliant. But, as a whole, it's disturbingly inconsistent. It feels as if two different movies have been put together; other about birds attacking people, and other about the characters and their problematic relations. This doesn't quite work because of the missing link between them. What's more, the characters are cold and uninteresting.'The Birds' is undeniably a classic piece of cinema history, but it's not one of Hitchcock's top achievements.",7,3,5,24 September 2000
