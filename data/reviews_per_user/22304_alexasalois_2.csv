Hereditary," Unsettling, creepy, stressful, one of the best horror/dramas!
","I'm a big fan of psychological horror movies (not the cheesy 'Conjuring' or 'Annabelle' movies, although they are very entertaining and fun), and so I really enjoyed this movie, as the tension and psychological horror throughout was mind-blowing. You are forced to watch really uncomfortable scenes and truly unsettling family dynamics, I wanted to leave the movie theater from how tense it was, that's how good Ari Aster was at conveying the emotion. I personally enjoy slow-paced horror with not many jumpscares, with more focus on the creepy and bone-chilling moral dilemmas, therefore I absolutely loved this movie. I have trouble watching it again because it was such an experience for me, and I don't know if I wanna go through that again.To summarize quickly, this is an amazing psychological experience through trauma, family, mental illness and fear, and I was completely immersed the entire time, feeling the characters' emotions and it was horrifying to see the story unfold without having control over it, making you question everything as you leave the theater. If you don't like slow-paced and usually enjoy the classic 'Blumhouse' movies, you might have difficulty with this one. Nonetheless, it has been a terrifying and exceptional movie for me personally. The amount of hidden details by Ari Aster is amazing, this is the kind of movie that you have to reflect on, and research about after viewing.",10,4,7,22 November 2019
Midsommar," Another great work from Ari Aster
","I very much enjoyed the horrifying experience of Hereditary, and so I was quite excited to see this movie. Midsommar manages to feel like an entirely new story, although both concepts turn out to be similar (creepy cult-looking stuff). Going into the movie theater, I was expecting to get 'kickked up' like Hereditary had previously done, but I was very pleasantly surprised. This movie had excellent character development, and the emphasis was really on the relationship between the two main characters, Christian and Dani. Even though I didn't walk out of the movie theater shaken and with a new point of view, it was really fun to watch and also had its fair share of creepy and unsettling moments. Once again, Ari Aster hides so many details throughout the movie and the foreshadowing is crazy, which makes it a really fun experience to try to notice all the 'secrets'. This movie was much more casual for me, and a good entertaining psychological horror. I would recommend, but beware, this movie is also quite long, and slow-paced, which might not please everyone. I personally really liked it, it was a much lighter storyline and the cinematography was brilliant in my opinion, conveys emotion really well.Another favourite from Ari! A deeper look into unhealthy and dying relationship dynamics. If you think you're about to see a 'Blumhouse' type of movie, this is not it, this is more of a drama. Nonetheless, still amazing to me.",9,2,4,22 November 2019
