The Blair Witch Project," Pseudo-Horror?
","I somewhat liked the film because, even though I read various things about the 'documentary,' I still wanted to see it to see exactly what happened to Heather, Josh, and Mike on film.  I watched with some anticipation, wondering if the title subject was going to appear so that there was some payoff to seeing something other that three lost people in the woods.  It was enjoyable in that it's sort of cinema verite, kind of 'here it is, this is what happened, it doesn't have to make sense since we're out filming our first documentary,' while at the same time it strives to be a horror film. It's caught between realism and fantasy, and I think that if one's imagination is tossed into the mix, then weird stuff comes out.  At one point I started thinking that maybe Heather was annoying for a reason, and I started wondering if she was part of the myth, had something to do with the witch, and realizing it now I see what effect the film had.  It presents itself as a documentary, but while watching it, I was thinking about one of the characters in terms of fantasy, that she (Heather) was in a fictional film, and so my imagination started posing questions that I felt would be answered if I kept watching.  And that's how the film kept my attention. If the film had a noticeable plot, the plot would be evidence of someone else's imagination, and then our emotional response would be the only thing we would express--we wouldn't ask any questions about what will happen. However, this film just presents itself--with our understanding of how it ends--and makes our imaginations ask questions, which in turn force us to be attentive to the film to get answers for those questions.  The film doesn't want us to take it seriously, because if we do, then we don't enjoy it out of dissatisfaction--we want to believe that it's either a film presenting itself as a documentary, or that it's a fictional film, that it can't be both.  It is that dilemma that I feel makes 'The Blair Witch Project' unique.",Null,1,2,14 August 1999
We Are Marshall," 'We Are Marshall' and Catharsis
","'We Are Marshall,' which concerns Marshall University's struggle to deal with the 1970 plane crash which claimed the lives of the entire varsity football team and their supporters, reflects on and is a cathartic experience, and is most enjoyable.After the crash, Marshall is left with a question: Should we even continue to have a football program? University president Don Dedmon (reliable David Strathairn) believes no, and cancels it. However, a few of the surviving varsity players who were not on the plane, in particular Nate Griffin, refuse to accept this. Although Griffin's stance is admirable, even he has a lesson to learn--he must deal with his grief.Catharsis is the process by which one releases suppressed feelings or emotions, and the entire town has to achieve this catharsis--of their grief over the crash--before they can truly move on. One of the surviving veteran players simply cannot play football because he felt he should have been on the plane; a father of a killed player (Ian McShane) refuses to let his late son's fianc√©e move on by her giving back her engagement ring; and the aforementioned Griffin, who feels that he must go above and beyond in his efforts for the new team because he feels that the late team 'left it in his hands.' But in being led by Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaghey), the town and the new team discover that you honor a team by continuing the tradition, and that by doing so, you find the strength to move on, to persevere, especially since the town invested so much emotional stock in the university and the team.I definitely recommend 'We Are Marshall.'",10,3,4,21 October 2007
The Passion of Joan of Arc," A Film That, Like Joan, Is Rebellious Yet Has a Soul
","WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!'The Passion of Joan of Arc' is, for me, one of the top three films of all time.  I regard it very highly because the film is able to combine influences from different countries (e.g., the set design is part German Expressionism, achieved by one of the set designers, German-born Hermann Warm), communicates both Joan's disoriented state of mind and her spirituality (sometimes at the same time) and accomplishes both of these achievements by the film's third asset:  the cinematography, largely done by Frenchman Rudolph Mate.  Not even in a film by Sergio Leone (Once Upon A Time In The West, for example) was the camera used so adventurously with regard to its use of the close-up.  Dreyer is gutsy enough to violate certain film norms to convey a feeling of disorientation and yet intimacy, so that we closer identify with Joan's state of mind--that of intense devoutness and despair.Dreyer has some shots canted (tilted) very severely, so that we're occasionally looking STRAIGHT UP at someone who looks down at us (such as Andre Berley's Jean D'Estivet, when he criticizes Joan).  Close-ups of people we've never seen before suddenly pop up, and we start to think: 'Who was that?'.  We lose our sense of what cinema calls spatial continuity, or a consistency in how objects are spaced from one another.  Because he uses so many close-ups, we cannot tell where one priest is from another, or where Joan is in relation to a priest who questions her.  We, like Joan, become confused at being interrogated (often the priests' questions are directed at US, as they look straight at the camera) from all sides.  The close-ups also emphasize contrasts in physical features (Dreyer made, as I understand it, his actors and actresses wear no make-up in the film), so that we see the ugliness of certain priests (particularly head interrogator Bishop Cauchon, played by Eugene Silvain) and the physical and spiritual beauty of Joan.It is because of the rule-breaking cinematography, along with the superb acting--no one overplays their role as silent film actors often tend to do--that the film retains its' marvelous power.  Seventy-two years after the film appeared, it is still mentioned in reviews about a film where Joan of Arc is the subject (Luc Besson's 'The Messenger' is the latest example), which attests to the film's strength.  Because of these virtues, I regard 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' very highly, and I strongly recommend that any filmgoer see it at least once, to experience a film that, like Joan, possesses a spirit that is timeless.",10,3,6,3 April 2000
The Deer Hunter," Unorthodox masterpiece
","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS REVEALED!!!I felt that 'The Deer Hunter' is a disturbing and unique film because of how the effects of the Vietnam War are portrayed.  The one thing that I admire about Michael Cimino here is that he had the courage (in my opinion) to throw out parts of the story that he felt had nothing to do with the points he wished to make.  For example, Cimino includes no concrete information as to why Nick, Mike, and Steven (played by Christopher Walken, Robert De Niro, and John Savage, respectively) are going to Vietnam, because he isn't concerned with WHY these men went to Vietnam.  Cimino is concerned with WHAT happened (physically and mentally) to these men once they experienced the war, and so he makes a daring decision to bolster his themes and statements at the expense of character motivation.  Cimino's methods of storytelling are very unorthodox but gutsy moves on how to tell a story in an American film, since normally in a film we expect to see what motivates the characters, and here Cimino violates so-called bedrock rules about narrative in American film.  Also, we see the psychological changes in Nick, Steve, and Mike through their actions after the war, not through espousions of philosophy about the war.The Russian roulette scenes are very powerful, even more so during the climax, since it is near the end of the war and yet the contest is still being staged for betting spectators.  The scene evokes for me images of the Roman Empire putting Christians to death for their amusement while Nero's Rome burns, and therefore it's very disturbing and a bit unsettling.  Also, there's the curious fact that Nick, Steve, and Mike are Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette.Finally, I have a theory about the film.  If you use your imagination and think about Mike's feelings towards 1) the theory of 'one shot' as it applies to the war and to deer hunting; and 2) Nick's girlfriend Linda (wonderful Meryl Streep), and combine these thoughts with what happens in the film, the film emerges with a new theme.Superb acting by all, unorthodox but inventive directing by Cimino, and great cinematography/music, make 'The Deer Hunter' a unique must-see.",10,0,0,6 March 2000
