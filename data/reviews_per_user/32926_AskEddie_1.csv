The Blair Witch Project," Imagination Required..so you can think about something else
","For every person who has claimed that an imagination is needed to understand this film, they are absolutely correct. You must imagine that you are in one of the other theatres, watching a different movie. This movie must be one of the most disappointing films in a very long time. The most devastating blow to its credibility was that there wasn't one genuinely scary scene; only 3 scenes could even be described as potentially scary.The acting, admittedly, was passable; the reactions of the cast were about what you would expect from the 3 filmmakers. However, although the idea was good, the execution of this film was very weak. How can you try to psychologically thrill your audience, when the sound is so horribly done that you can't hear the sounds that the characters are afraid of? In addition, some of the events that make their situation worse could have been handled by some unexplained phenomena; I highly doubt anyone would kick their only map into a river. In conclusion, TBWP is merely an overhyped, extremely disappointing piece of filmmaking that avoids the dreaded one only because of some very good acting in a horrid script- if there even was one.
