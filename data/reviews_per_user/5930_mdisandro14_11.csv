Scarface," The Story of Excess
","This truly is a story of excess, power, and greed and how these can change a man. Also a rags to riches story. This is one of my favorite movies of all times for a number of reason.

Jackie Brown," Decent
",There wasn't too much i heavily disliked about this movie but it was also sort of boring. Not a bad movie by any means but its kind of a dull boring plot line that drags too long. Not your usual tarintino film as it isnt as crazy violent or extreme as most his films.,8,0,0,5 June 2019
