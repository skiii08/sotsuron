Marie Antoinette," Visually beautiful.
","When I first saw the advertisement for this film, I thought it looked very promising and it really appealed to me from a visual point of view. Upon watching it, I realized a few things, although they might not be so true. Sofia Copolla appears to like the directing styles of Baz Luhrman, in a way. Her use of modern music molding in with music that would fit into that time period. It was slightly confusing. However, it was slightly refreshing to be able to sit down and watch a period film and relate to it because of the types of music chosen. The only thing that makes it sloppy is the mixture of the two types.Visually, I was stunned by this movie and I don't think Kirsten Dunst has looked better in any other film she has been in. The lighting and the clothing colour choices were flattering on each of the characters and I didn't feel melancholic just watching it. Aside from the strange music, I think this is the kind of movie where the actors can get away with performances that are just 'OK.' This let it down somewhat and I wish that they had put a little bit more effort into it. In saying this, the acting wasn't bad at it was convincing enough for me to watch.I liked this film, but it just needed a little something more.",7,0,1,30 December 2007
