Lucky Number Slevin," Now thats a movie!
","Lets face it - it isn't exactly new and untried form of movie, but damn! I was entertained, from start to finish. Brilliant actors, VERY good change of scenes and angles.Even Josh Hartnett, whom I'm not exactly fond of, surprised me.All the way trough, there's this, almost subliminal humor - makes you feel GOOOOOD!This movie is HIGHLY recommended, for ANYone, with even the slightest sense of humor.So, if you need a GOOD laugh - Here it is.Dennis Maleki",10,1,6,4 July 2006
Silent Hill," Jesus Christ....
","I have to be frank... What a WIDE LOAD of bull****! As if we haven't seen more than enough of little scary girls... We get it - They're creepy... However, in order to make a film with good spokes - IT IS NOT ENOUGH just to have a little girl with wet hair. She is probably the WORST child actor I have EVER seen in my entire life.And the director: The film is FULL of technical- and visual errors, and if that isn't enough for you - From START to ENDING the movie is SO predictable.Do yourself, your parents and your pals a favor: Don't waste money on a crappy film like this!",1,7,15,4 July 2006
