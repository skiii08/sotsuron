The Devil's Advocate," Dark...brilliant...fits my taste
","WARNING: SPOILERS CONTAINED
However, this film can be either an inventive, experimental masterpiece or a piece of rubbish, I must admit.With different spices added to this flick, Lomax (Keanu Reeves), a promising defending attorney, his wife (Charlize Theron) and his new employer (Al Pacino), are the central characters. A little bit of horror, suspense, fantasy, lust, and incest mixed up. Graphic scenes, especially the naked women. No matter how surreal the plot is, I now consider it a tale which has something to say. It's so much fun to watch Lomax, being a hotshot advocate, has eventually realised that he can't get them both - conscience and success. Or I should say, vanity.So what is John Milton (Al Pacino) anyway? It's good that we don't get a clear answer from the movie. We do know that he possesses black magic, and maybe something even more powerful. Charlize Theron's performance is splendid. And then, the evil is displayed throughout the movie as intriguing force (intriguing, indeed). After Lomax breaks the spell by exercising his individual free will, he gets a second chance to have his life and to make a different decision. Unfortunately, the very ending is rather weak. Nevertheless, I think you can learn something from it.'Vanity is my favourite sin', says Milton. He says it more than once. Maybe that's the whole point. I find 'The Devil's Advocate' profound...philosophical, in a way you wouldn't notice it so easily. I also enjoy the madness, the bloodiness and the sense of 'seeking your success, and succumbing into your own ego and - vanity'. All these fascinating elements are put together beautifully by director Taylor Hackford.",8,0,1,12 May 2001
50 First Dates," Sandler and Barrymore did it again
","Set in Hawaii, this romantic comedy brings you a laid-back, lively atmosphere, although the core of the story is rather simplistic and predictable. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore successfully collaborated 'The Wedding Singer' and this time they gave it a second try. Personally, I don't think '50 First Dates' is as good as 'The Wedding Singer', even the soundtrack is quite similar to the latter's.Henry (Sandler) is a vet working in Hawaii and also a womaniser. One day, at a diner, he meets Lucy (Barrymore) and falls in love with her. It turns out that the day after they have a very enjoyable conversation, Lucy doesn't remember Henry at all. Then it is revealed that due to a serious car crash, Lucy suffers from short-term memory loss and can only remember things that take place before the car accident. Determined to win the girl's heart, now Henry has to start over every single morning to charm her and make her fall for him again. Not as powerful as 'The Wedding Singer', but Sandler's romantic side is very touching and the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore works well. Suitable for a depressing rainy day but nothing beyond that. 5/10",Null,0,0,31 May 2004
The Terminator," Fascinating
","In 1997, there will be a nuclear war. Skynet, a computer, becomes self-aware and the machines dominate the world. Humans suffer from their ruling immensely. But one man teaches the rest of them how to fight back and they eventually win. His name is John Connor.Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a young, gentle waitress who lives in 1984 has become the target of termination, and a cyborg called The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent from 2029 to assassinate her, so the existence of her unborn son, John Connor, will be entirely wiped out. One soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) has also been sent from the future by John Connor to protect Sarah. Now The Terminator is out there, after Sarah, and her life is about to be changed forever...For the film industry, 'The Terminator' is very inspiring, regarding its special effects and even the idea of time travel- 'Twelve Monkeys''s concept upon time travel and what eventually happens to the hero is very similar to the one of 'The Terminator'. For 1984, the visual effects are amazing. Although the second and the third Terminator flicks have even more powerful technology, this one is still the most original among the three. The action scenes are stunning, the suspense is always there, quite spine-chilling, and surprisingly, there is even romantic chemistry- which is rather interesting. AND the acting is good. Not to mention the dazzling directing by James Cameron- highly recommended.",Null,0,0,11 April 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget Jones- the modern Cinderella
","Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is 32, overweight, working at a book publishing company, always embarrasses herself in public AND single. She decides to do something with her life, starting with keeping a diary, in which she candidly tells what she observes in her daily life. She also makes plan for herself- stop smoking, stop drinking, go to the gym, eat less, find a man...when her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) begins flirting with her, she joins the game all at once. Meanwhile, she seems always unable to avoid the annoying presence of Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a renowned barrister who saw Bridget running around naked when she was 4 in a paddling pool- and they just hate each other. In the meantime, Bridget also has to deal with the breakdown of her parents' marriage (which is portrayed in a rather comic way).Eventually, Bridget painfully realises that Daniel is nothing but a j*rk, and gradually she and Mark become more and more attracted to each other, surprisingly. They both confess to each other that they 'like' each other. Bridget ends up kind of like a modern day Cinderella.'Bridget Jones's Diary' is a finely-made romantic comedy, and Renee Zellweger's English accent is quite consistent and convincing (although still not as good as Gwyneth Paltrow's), unlike some other American actors. Hugh Grant is nice playing a different (from most other characters he had played) type of role this time, and Colin Firth is simply graceful and charming as Mark Darcy. The soundtrack is fantastic, and there are many memorable scenes and quotes, among them the very sweet cooking scene and the ultra-hilarious fighting scene. This is worth watching (and even owning!) for its hilarity and sweetness. 7/10",Null,0,0,3 April 2004
Fargo," Blood in snow
","Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is in a financial crisis and he comes up with the idea of cooperating with a couple of wee criminals from Fargo, North Dakota to kidnap his wife and demand his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom so he can split the money with the kidnappers. His father-in-law is later shot dead by the abductors because he shouldn't even be the one who go see them. Then they gunned down a cop and two witnesses on the highway- things go inevitably wrong. The heavily pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is in charge with investigating a case about a stolen vehicle, which leads her to a visit with Lundegaard. Gunderson is about to uncover a chain of bloody crimes.'Fargo' is a gripping, dark film and indeed, in a way, it is a comedy because at times it makes you laugh. Frances McDormand and William H Macy were quite brilliant, Steve Buscemi is funny and his quiet partner (unfortunately I can't remember or locate his name) is even funnier. The whole movie leaves you freezing, literally, not just because of the setting, but also because of the plot. I admire the Coen brothers' work, such as 'The Big Lebowski', which is very different from this one, but is dead hilarious.",Null,0,0,18 March 2004
Notting Hill," Perfect for a rainy day
","I didn't like this film the first time I saw it. However, watching it again and again changed my point of view. As William Thacker, Hugh Grant plays an owner of a travel bookshop in Notting Hill, London, who doesn't run his business particularly successfully. One day, the best-loved American movie star Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) walks into his shop and buys a book. Later on, they run into each other, this time William accidentally spills orange juice on Anna's top. William asks her to get changed in his flat...But under the pressure from media, their love affair cannot last long, especially when William finds out that Anna has a somewhat estranged boyfriend (Alec Baldwin), which totally breaks his heart. Now they part. Seasons change, but William still can't forget Anna. In the end, Anna returns, and asks William to give her a second chance...This is a gentle-paced romantic comedy which is full of tender love and sweet surprises. There are more than one love story in this flick- the love of Max (Tim McInnerny) and Bella (Gina McKee), the love of Spike ( William's flat mate, played by Rhys Ifans) and Honey (William's kid sister, played by Emma Chambers)...Rhys Ifans is impressive as the eccentric and yet creative and hilarious Spike, unlike the roles he usually plays, which is a delight. Sit back and relax, enjoy these tender love stories. The changing seasons at Portobello Market and the Notting Hill area are somewhat idolised (I had been in Notting Hill for three months), but who can say, despite all the chaos in London, that the city itself is not beatiful in some way? 6.5/10",Null,0,0,7 March 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A very successful sequel
","Ten years ago, a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before her child can be born, who will one day be the leader of the human resistance against the machines. Now, Skynet (the machines) once again has sent T-1000 (Robert Patrick) to kill the young John Connor (Edward Furlong) so he will never become the fighter. Meanwhile, the human forces also sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to fight against T-1000, which is, in fact, more advance than the Terminator. Now Sarah Connor has to find the mastermind behind the plan about activating Skynet, and stop him from proceeding.This sequel has lived up to viewers' expectations- it is very different from the original, and Sarah Connor has gone through an amazing transformation- changing from a sweet, innocent young woman into a tough fighter. Edward Furlong's debut is simply spectacular. The film contains loads of high-tech and exciting action scenes, which are well-presented. The movie doesn't repeat the original, which is good. All in all, a nicely-done sci-fi action flick. Too bad 'Terminator III' is far less powerful and doesn't provide anything new. Watch this one and the original.",8,0,0,9 June 2004
In the Name of the Father," Read the book
","In the early 1970s, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) went to London from Belfast to pursue a different life and later on he found work there. In 1974, along with friends and family, he was arrested and later accused of the Guilford Bombing.Conlon was to spend fifteen years in jail for something he had never done. His father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite) was also imprisoned and years later died in jail due to ill health and improper  prison medical care. Gerry Conlon was transferred from prison to prison and he fought for clearing his and his father's names. Throughout the initial interrogations he was heavily abused by the British police.With the relentless efforts of his lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), finally, after fifteen years, the verdicts were quashed.The film is about one man's journey fighting against one of the most shocking miscarriages of justice in British history and undeservedly tortured innocent civilians. This is a moving, powerful story well told. However, if you like this film, don't forget to read the book. It's even more fascinating and you'll realise how much the film has left out. Still, this is for certain one of the greatest films made in the 1990s.",Null,1,3,19 February 2004
Gone with the Wind," An impeccable masterpiece
","WARNING: SPOILERSThis story is about one woman- she is beautiful, she is rebellious, she is daring, she is strong, she is Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), a young lady from a wealthy family in Georgia in the 1860s. The civil war is imminent, and all men are ready to go to the battle fields. Scarlett is deeply in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he is about to marry his calm, graceful cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland) and Scarlett refuses to accept the reality. At Twelve Oaks, where upper-class people gather for a party, where the gentlemen discuss the upcoming war, where Scarlett pleads with Ashley to marry her, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a free-spirited man falls in love with her at first sight. Out of despair, Scarlett accepts Charles Hamilton's (Melanie's brother, played by Rand Brooks) proposal, only to become a widow soon after the war has started.The nation is torn, the great South is a smoking ruin and Scarlett's home, Tara, is burnt down. Once the proud and shining wealth and glory that used to be no longer exist. They are replaced with misery, starvation, poverty, sickness and deaths. Meanwhile, Scarlett and Rhett develop an unconventional but not physical relationship. But Scarlett chooses to marry Franklin Kennedy (Carroll Nye) in order to save Tara and make a good living. Only Melanie, the most compassionate woman in this story, empathises with Scarlett's intention. Unfortunately, their unhappy marriage doesn't last long. Franklin is later killed in an attempted ambush against the Yankees.Finally, Rhett asks Scarlett to marry him and in the beginning, they live a content life. However, when Rhett discovers that Scarlett still hasn't forgotten about Ashley, his intense jealousy fuels and this marks the start of their troubles. Scarlett loses her unborn son, then her young daughter. After all this, she eventually loses her true love- which is Rhett, as she finally realises.Of course this story is told from a woman's perspective, because this story is about a woman. This is a grand epic, the actors were marvellous and the technology was simply unbeatable. This film is about a courageous woman who goes through three marriages and still confused about who her true love is, and her lingering destroys Rhett's love for her. The whole tale is certainly tragic, but the ending suggests that there is hope, so long as Scarlett remains optimistic about the future. This film, in my opinion, is not just for women. I believe everybody can appreciate this outstanding piece of work. This is an all-time classic.",9,2,3,12 June 2004

He forms the class as a choir and discovers one of the boy's amazing potential, transforms him from a trouble-maker into a gifted singer and a more disciplined child. Now the boy is a renowned orchestra conductor. As he reads Mr Mathieu, the teacher's diary written fifty years ago with a then classmate, the memories slowly flow back...Prepare a handkerchief before you see this film. This is a deeply moving story. A little sentimental, maybe, but in a good way, which let us see the bright side of the human spirit. Mr Mathieu is portrayed as a saint, almost too good to be true, but perhaps such loving and dedicated educators do exist. All in all, this is a must see, because the movie touches your very soul.",8,8,14,22 September 2004
The Pianist," One man's struggle for survival; one people's tragic history; one story about war and humanity- an all-time masterpiece
","Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) was a renowned Jewish pianist in Poland. As the Second World War broke out, Jews were forced to move to the Jewish ghetto. Later, Szpilman's family were sent to a concentration camp but he managed to escape, and his hiding began. He went through fear of being found, starvation, thirst and any horror you can imagine. He survived. He once again worked for Polish Radio and became a soloist, and regained his human dignity.The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman is intense and poignant, the film itself is outstandingly directed by the brilliant Roman Polanski (Chinatown) and he realised Adrien Brody's amazing potential. Brody's performance is simply stunning, just perfect. Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) as the surprisingly sympathetic Nazi officer who, not only did not arrest Szpilman, but was so overwhelmed when listening to him play the piano, as though Captain Hosenfeld at long last heard the most wonderful sound, not the sound of bombs and gunfire, and gave Szpilman food and his coat. This other side of one Nazi soldier was just astounding. It's all about humanity.
Being a survivor of the Holocaust, Roman Polanski vividly depicted the era of mass destruction and genocide in the motion picture, the scenes are truly graphic and yet downright realistic, therefore shocking in every way. Adrien Brody also has Polish ancestry and he made Szpilman once again come to life. The movie itself is splendidly made, and words simply cannot describe the impact it has made upon me. Polanski and Brody are absolutely triumphant. This is even better than 'Schindler's List', in some people's opinions. I give this film 10/10. Do not miss it.P.S. In the movie, we never know what happened to Szpilman's family.",10,1,4,28 March 2004
Good Will Hunting," An enriching cinema experience
","Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an orphan who has been to a number of abusive foster homes. At twenty, he starts working at the prestigious MIT as a caretaker on parole, since he's been involved in several assaults. One day the tough maths question on the board is found solved and the searching of the mystery genius begins. When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) realises it is Will who has solved the difficult tasks, he decides to help him by offering him working on further maths studies and seeing a psychotherapist. Talented and yet highly defensive, Will manages to scare all the shrinks away and eventually Professor Lambeau has to turn to psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), his university roommate for help. Sean's unique approach finally touches the deep inside of Will's complex and it gradually dilutes Will's insecurity and distrust of people. Meanwhile, Will falls in love with Harvard med student Skylar (Minnie Driver) but later has to confront his inner uncertainty. In the end, Sean and Will helps each other to deal with their own issues.I simply do not comprehend why on earth some people out there don't appreciate this film, and I don't think I have to, because I know this is a GOOD film. The acting is intense and the dialogue is witty and often hard for the actors to carry out reading. The story is about a highly intelligent young man who has too many past injuries to heal and who eventually is given a helping hand (two, actually) to rediscover himself. The ending is just a clever one. 9.9/10",Null,0,2,19 February 2004
Back to the Future Part III," My favourite among the three
","At the end of 'Back to the Future Part II', Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) are ready to go back to 1985, but the time machine is struck by lightning and Doc just disappears with the DeLorean. Instantly, Marty receives a letter from the West Union, which was written by Doc seventy years ago, instructing Marty where to find the hidden time machine in order to get himself back to 1985, with the Doc in 1955's help and that the time machine must be destroyed after Marty gets back to his time, so time travel will not cause any trouble again. But soon, Marty finds a grave of Doc's and is determined to save his life. So Marty goes back to 1885 and meets his ancestors.Doc lives contently as a scientist who disguises himself as an ironmongery shop owner.

But his death is approaching- he's to be shot dead by 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F Wilson), the ancestor of Biff Tannen (also Thomas F Wilson). Now Marty must save Doc from being murdered and meanwhile he puts his own life in danger by once again succumbing to his weakness- he simply cannot stand being called a 'coward'.After considering the pros and cons, Doc decides to go back to 1985 with Marty and he confesses the truth to Clara, but of course she doesn't believe a word he's said. Heartbroken, Doc is ready to leave with Marty. However, when Clara discovers that Doc has told her the truth, she chases him while Doc and Marty are pushing the time machine with a specially-equipped train...now Doc must choose between going back to his time, or staying with Clara...I love the Wild West scenes, the party and all that...and Doc is in love! Such wonder and magic! The ending is so sweet. This is a perfect ending of the trilogy and the final message is very positive and encouraging- the future can be changed!!! I consider this movie a very imaginative one. Watch the trilogy consecutively, and if you're a time travel fan, you won't be disappointed! 9/10",Null,0,0,15 March 2004
Million Dollar Baby," This movie is about the meaning of LIFE
","Once again, Clint Eastwood did it. 'Million Dollar Baby' has proved to be an overwhelmingly powerful film. Because of this movie, Hilary Swank won her second Academy Award after winning an Oscar for her role in 'Boys Don't Cry' five years ago. Also, Morgan Freeman finally won the same award for Best Actor in a Supporting role, which is well-deserved. I cannot help mentioning Eastwood's previous work 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River'. I think he is a brilliant film director.Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) is a 31-year-old waitress who aspires to become a professional boxer, despite her age. She finds Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), a boxing trainer with a fine reputation and who runs a boxing gym, hoping he will help her. But 'I don't train girls', says he.Notwithstanding the fact that he has turned Maggie down, she goes to the gym everyday to practise on her own, even though she doesn't know how to do it right at all. Her strong will somehow impresses Scrap (Freeman), an assistant and caretaker at the gym, a former boxer who loses an eye during a boxing fight. He starts to encourage Maggie and teaches her some basic things. Eventually, Frankie decides to train her, out of her amazing will power. Maggie trains intensively, because THIS is her dream, her only pursuit, she wants to get there, and in the end, she does get there...Within a couple of years, Maggie is ready for fights. She is indeed a natural, and it is owing to the fact that she works so very hard. Even though at times she has to confront tougher boxers, she makes it anyway. She never backs down. She becomes rich and famous, and she firmly believes her achievement would make her family proud. Now what she wants to do is to take good care of her family.But her nearly penniless mother despises her, because she thinks being a female boxer is simply ridiculous. She is 'ashamed' of Maggie, laughs at her, and her other family members are totally indifferent.By then Maggie and Frankie have developed a father-daughter relationship. As a matter of fact, the relationships between Maggie, Frankie and Scrap are quite intriguing. This picture portrays their interaction perfectly.'Millon Dollar Baby' strikes you when it's least expected. There are many points which leave you wonder: what price dreams? What do you live for? For basic survival or for reaching your goal, so you can be your true self? Are you willing to pay for it? No matter what? And what is LIFE about? If you had seen the film, you would understand what I'm talking about.Maggie has a family who takes her for granted, and Frankie has a daughter who never sees him, who always ignores his letters. In the end, all they've got is each other, but after all they have gone through, after all the respect Maggie gains (Scrap says 'Boxing is about respect. You win respect and take respect from the other guy) and Frankie's being so proud of her, they have to lose each other.This film makes people think. Deeply. This year's Academy Award Best Picture nominees are all good, I have seen all of them, but I would vote for 'Million Dollar Baby' without any hesitation.",10,9,12,7 April 2005
Casualties of War," Is there such a thing as a holy war?
","A good try by Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn is as powerful as always. The performance by Thuy Thu Le is particularly haunting, with the heart-wrenching score. The film is based on the report and the book by Daniel Lang.There used to be six soldiers in the squad. After one of them is shot dead by the Vietcons, Sergeant Meserve (Sean Penn) leads the rest of the squad kidnapping a female villager (Thuy Thy Le) and the soldiers gang rape her, but Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) refuses to do so. He fails to help the girl to escape and eventually she is brutally murdered. Eriksson is determined to bring these men to justice but no one cares and it takes him a long way to succeed.Even though there are righteous causes of wars, the ugliness of atrocities can be seen all the time. Women get raped by soldiers, children being slaughtered, these happen everyday in wars. 'Casualties of War' provides us an important aspect of war, and is only a tip of the iceberg.",9,0,1,24 February 2004

When she has arrived with her daughter and her precious piano, they are left on the shore. Later on, her newly-wed husband, Alistair Stewart (Sam Neill) sells her piano to a neighbour, George Baines (Harvey Keitel) in order to make a deal about his land.

However, soon she finds out that Baines wants more than this. Their relationship turns into something inexplicable and all parties involved end up in destructive, turbulent consequences.
The piano is Ada's voice and her inner passion. She is a victim of a loveless marriage, lust, burning and boiling longing and jealousy. The film explores one woman's desire and sexuality in an achingly romantic way. The colour of the movie is sombre, which fits the story perfectly. For Ada, true love is found in the most unexpected, unconventional situation. The plot is filled with passion and seeking fulfillment.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Too many loopholes
","Despite the trend of violence depicted in this film which serves entertainment value, 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is a pathetic joke. There is no comparison between this and Quentin Tarantino's previous work 'The Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. This flick is utterly hollow.The story is about a heavily pregnant bride and assassin (Uma Thurman) who is severely tortured by her fellow assassins and gunned down by her boss and the child's father Bill (David Carradine). She survives the massacre (all the wedding guests are killed), falls into a coma and wakes up four years later (the assassination squad originally decides to murder her while she is in a coma, but the mission is later aborted because Bill wants to maintain their reputation) and begins her bloody revenge- killing her one-time co-workers, one by one. Here are some of the numerous loopholes in the film:The bride awakes from her coma, looks at her body in disbelief and murmurs 'four years...four years!'. How on earth is she aware that it has been four years since she falls into a coma?She lies on the floor, behind the medical staff member who has been repeatedly raping her while she is in a coma and pulls out a knife and attacks the man. How on earth does she still have a knife with her when she has been hospitalised for four years? She is supposed to have nothing on her. She leaves the hospital in her patient's gown with the car of the attacked man while she is in a coma, and later she arrives at the neighbourhood where Vivica A. Fox's character lives with normal clothes. How does she get them? She then travels light (EXTREMELY light, with only a bag) and buys a single ticket to Okinawa. Where does she get the money? After four years of being isolated from the outside world, is her bank account still valid? Could she really have the money for a plane ticket to Okinawa and another one to Tokyo?There are scenes in which she is on the aeroplane with her sword. Is it ever possible that she is ALLOWED to carry a sword onto a plane?You may find the action bit dazzling, but this is what I call 'pulp fiction'. You may find this movie experimental, but I find it a failed attempt of Tarantino's. The flashbacks is nothing new. I don't see any original, creative or profound meaning in this film.",3,3,6,7 July 2004
The Fly," Disgusting indeed, but that's the way it's supposed to be
","Magazine journalist Veronica 'Ronnie' Quaife (Geena Davis) meets scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) during an interview, at a science fair-like party. Seth has been working alone on 'teleportation', a new way of transportation, if successfully developed, you won't have to get car-sick, or air-sick, or sea-sick, or even tricycle-sick...any more. Ronnie witnesses Seth's experiments, right from the turned-inside out baboon (it seems to be a prophecy for the future horror)  to success. And eventually, the two fall in love.Seth tries to teleport himself and he makes it. What he doesn't know yet is that a housefly gets into the booth and is stuck there with him. The computer gets confused, mixes Seth's DNA with the insect's. He begins to transform into a half human, half bug monster. His changes are not just physical, not just what he looks like, but also mental. He's no longer Seth Brundle, the gentle, shy, intelligent, charming and lonely scientist, he is now vicious, aggressive 'Brundlefly'. He doesn't act like a human being, because he's not a human being. He acts like a dangerous, brutal mutant.It is fascinating to watch the process of Seth Brundle's metamorphosis. At the beginning Seth is scared, then he becomes more like a freak psychologically, although he desperately wants to be a human again. His profound sadness, shame and despair become fury when he sees Stathis Borans (Ronnie's editor and ex-boyfriend, played by John Getz) accompany Ronnie (nothing else, just accompanying her, that's all). This could be the reason why later Brundlefly attacks Stathis so mercilessly. Although it is out of self-defense (Stathis is about to shoot Seth with a shotgun, trying to save Ronnie), but Brundlefly almost kills Stathis because he has always been so jealous of Stathis and hates him so much, even Stathis is no longer involved with Ronnie.Originally it is a good intention to invent teleportation, but when something goes wrong during the scientific experiment with Seth himself, it becomes a personal tragedy. The film itself is intense, Geena Davis delivers a powerful, fantastic performance as heartbroken Ronnie. But I find Stathis Borans an especially likeable character, at first he is a bit annoying and possessive as Ronnie's ex-lover, but later when Ronnie is in trouble, he lovingly helps her and stays by her side.Followed by a compelling sequel.",8,0,1,20 August 2000

Titanic," You LOVE it, or you HATE it, nothing in between
","WARNING: SPOILERSThis film took enormous efforts to make and the special effects were outstanding achievement. Why criticising the movie because the two main characters are fictitious? This is a story based on the FACT of the sinking of the unsinkable, just a story. A very emotional one, perhaps at times too sentimental, but for certain good entertainment. The cast were superb, even though the plot seems surreal. Leonardo DiCaprio deserved more credits for his acting, Kate Winslet's and Gloria Stuart's performances were fabulous. The movie received much acclaim and criticism alike, simply because it was such a smash-hit.Like Romeo and Juliet, Jack's (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose's (Kate Winslet) love would never die, because it is cut short before it can- one brief encounter brings the love that lasts for a life time. I believe love makes anything possible, so even in 1912, an upper-class young woman would fall in love with a third-class male passenger, because Rose is a different girl. She is rebellious and audacious, but feels caged by her upcoming marriage with Cal (Billy Zane), all just for his wealth to support Rose and her mother. Jack falls in love with her at first sight, saves her life and the chemistry between them becomes burning and boiling. Such love affair is possible. Anything is possible. Rose admires Picasso, and Jack is an artist who travels around and only has ten bucks in his pocket. They set each other's spirit free. The party at the lower-class section is great fun, real fun. Rose says to Jack that, when the ship arrives in America, she will go with him.So it is too late when they have realised that the unsinkable has collided with an iceberg, and the life boats are not enough for all passengers. The mass death is gruesome. When Rose hears the boat coming back, Jack has already been frozen to death, so she lets go, watching his body sink into the deep end.When the older Rose (Gloria Stuart) has told her story to the crew who have been searching for the Heart of the Ocean, the blue diamond, their faces are all covered with tears. But what really matters is, the Heart of the Ocean has still not been found. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) gives up his ambition. The diamond will never be found.Rose gets to the edge of the search team ship, get the Heart of the Ocean out of her pocket, and throws it into the sea. So now it is with Jack, forever.If it wasn't Jack, Rose wouldn't be here today...James Cameron created a dazzling work of art. You love it, or you hate it, nothing in between. However, this doesn't apply to me. I am, as a matter of fact, not mad about the film, and don't hate it, either.",Null,1,3,18 March 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Russell Crowe deserved an Academy Award
","John Nash (Russell Crowe), a native of West Virginia, was a maths genius at Princeton. His teaching career was going steadily, his future was promising and he met a beautiful, intelligent woman (Jennifer Connelly)in his class. By then he had been working on cryptography for a special agent (Ed Harris). He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia.As the film progresses, Nash went through hospitalisation, intensive electric shock, was heavily sedated by his medication and watching his marriage and family life about to collapse. His career was nearly over. He then had yet another relapse. However, he managed to conquer it all and decades later came his triumph- Nobel Prize.'A Beautiful Mind' vividly depicts schizophrenia and what it brought to one man's life. This movie is not to be missed. Russell Crowe is outstanding as the highly talented and yet tormented John Nash. I would vote for him for the Best Actor in a leading role Academy Award.",Null,0,1,17 February 2004
Back to the Future Part II," Just cool
","Marty (Michael J Fox) is glad to be back to 1985. A much better 1985 with a much happier family, because back in 1955 something good happens and that changes the future. While he's about to relax with his girlfriend, Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue), Doc Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) comes back from 2015 with his DeLorean time machine and asks Marty to go back to the future to save his children. While doing their job, Marty buys a sports almanac of the 20th century and unfortunately, when Doc seriously asks him to throw it away, Biff (Thomas F Wilson), a long-time nemesis, overhears their conversation, takes the book from the waste bin, steals the time machine and gives the almanac to his younger self back in 1955.When Doc and Marty get back to 1985, they realise that things have changed. Hill Valley has turned into hell, governed by the wealthy, powerful and devilish Biff Tannen. Marty's father has long been dead and his mother is married to Biff. What went wrong? Finally Doc and Marty find out that they must revisit 1955 and get things right...This fascinating sequel has some fun and some dark sides in it. The skate boarding scene is just brilliant. What a deja vu. The 2015 presented in the film is quite interesting (I wonder if 2015 will look just like that) and we get to watch once again Marty playing 'Johnny B Goode' and his father punching Biff. In the end, after getting back in 1985, Marty unintentionally changes his own future for better again. Most sequels are pathetic, but this one is different. It succeeds in exciting the audience. The whole cast did a good job, Michael J Fox is great fun playing several characters at the same time. Along with the original and 'Back to the Future Part III', this is for certain one of the best time travel flicks. Not to be missed!",Null,23,28,15 March 2004
Trainspotting," An excellent comedy which deals with serious issues
","The Edinburgh drug scene, 1990s, five pals hanging out constantly, two of them are clean, but eventually one of the remaining two can't resist the temptation. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) is the main character who attempts to get rid of his heroin addiction but fails. Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) is a huge admirer of Sean Connery's and rather the cleverest of the five. Spud (Ewen Bremner) never thinks of hurting others, Tommy (Kevin McKidd) is a sports fan who in the end suffers tremendously from heroin and Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is the one who gets into fights all the time and who always stays clean. Diane (Kelly Macdonald) is Renton's under age girlfriend whom he meets at a pub. Renton is stunned by Diane's impressive audacity.After a near-death experience Renton's parents are determined to help their son to get clean and when they have succeeded Renton shifts to London to get his one-time pals behind his back, starts a new life and finds a job. Very soon, his 'friends' track him down and they want to talk him into a deal. The ending suggests that Renton eventually chooses 'life'.The scenes that deals with illusions are presented beautifully, with a cool soundtrack and brilliant ensemble performance. Every moment of the film is gripping and never leaves you tired. We see drug addiction, violence, crime, struggle, sex and betrayal portrayed in a very creative way. This is definitely a classic.",Null,0,0,13 March 2004
The Matrix," If only my life could be as cool as it is in...'The Matrix'
","It is such an enjoyable journey to watch this film. Stunning choreography and special effects, spectacular cinematography (which makes Keanu Reeves look so...you know...so...) and the theme of the story - the 'real' world and the virtual world.Personally, I find our real world nearly surreal, almost a dream. But in this movie, you can live a more real life in the virtual world, where it appears to be a dream but it's not entirely so. You can learn so many different things much faster by getting those programmes into your head. In the virtual world you look a lot better, you can be your 'real' self, that is to say, to be able to use your potential to prove to the world that you're someone special.To me, this film has inspired me in some way. The reality is, we are getting closer and closer to that virtual paradise (a paradise with commotion, of course).If you're already a fan of Keanu's, than I suppose you will say to yourself 'Keanu Reeves is my hero! I want to be like him!'; if you're not really a fan, than it's most definitely sure that you'll become one after you see 'The Matrix'!",9,1,2,17 May 2001
The Wedding Singer," Sandler and Barrymore at their best
","Floating back in time in 1985...Robbie (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer who aspires to become a singer/songwriter but now is just looking forward to marrying his fiancee, Linda (Angela Featherstone), who eventually dumps him at their wedding. Robbie then meets Julia (Drew Barrymore), a waitress at the restaurant at which he works. She's engaged to Wall Street stock broker Glenn (Matthew Glave), whom later Robbie finds out has been unfaithful to her and doesn't give a da*n about the wedding planning. While helping Julia planning her forthcoming wedding, Robbie falls in love with her. But misunderstanding causes an undesirable consequence and Robbie must chase the right girl of his life...This movie is simply sweet. I usually am not especially fond of Adam Sandler's performances but I find him likeable in this one. Drew Barrymore's acting needs refinement, the two 'Charlie's Angels' flicks are nothing but disasters and she has a long way to go to get what she achieved for her work in 'E. T.'. HOWEVER, in 'The Wedding Singer' she is perfect. Not like her other films. She used to be a better actress back in those days when she played 'bad' girls, such as 'Guncrazy' and 'Mad Love'. I am pleased with her performance in this movie, though her hairdo doesn't look that 80s. The scene in which Sandler sings 'Holiday' miserably and 'Love Stinks' angrily is hilarious- he ends up in the rubbish. And on the aeroplane when he sings to Julia 'Grow Old with You' is truely romantic. All in all, a good romantic comedy.",Null,1,1,18 March 2004
Back to the Future," What would it be like for me to travel back in time then back again?
","Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is pretty much an outcast at school. His school master doesn't like him and his rock music is not appreciated by his school, either. What he only has is his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) and his good friend, Dr Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty comes from a miserable family, his father George (Crispin Glover) is constantly bullied by his superior Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) and the rest of his family are just pathetic.This is the year of 1985. Doc asks Marty to assist him videotaping his new invention- a time travel machine using plutonium stolen from the terrorists whom Doc is supposed to work for. When Doc is shot, Marty gets into the time machine and accidentally goes back to 1955.There he once again, by accident, interrupts the meeting of his future parents. Now he must find Doc in order to get him back to the future and make his teenage parents fall in love with each other, otherwise Marty won't even exist. What he is not aware is that, by encouraging his father, George, the latter makes a significant step to fight back Biff, who goes to the same high school with him and who has been bullying him forever. This time, Marty changes his future for better, which is a sweet surprise.Without plutonium, Doc and Marty can only rely on lightning to send Marty back to 1985. Fortunately, Marty has got the exact information on when the clock tower will be struck by the lightning, so he can go back to the future. He also leaves Doc a note asking him not to open until 1985...This is the film which made Michael J Fox to stardom and he is dynamic. Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the flaky Doc Brown. It must be utterly funny to travel back in time...thirty years earlier. The film is truly entertaining. An all time classic for sure.",Null,0,1,14 March 2004
