The Avengers," Best movie i have ever seen :)
",After watching this movie one thing which came in to your mind is 'WOOOW' great job in FUN and Action... and their combination is Deadly:) i just watched is yesterday and i buy ticked for today too. Show is on. I must say its a movie which you would like to see again and again and again. Effects are awesome and every super hero play its vital role. My personal favorite Iron Man :) was as usual wicked :) Action of HULK was breath taking this time. Loki was looking good in suit ;-) Over all concept was amazing which we have seen before many times. gathering super heroes for a common cause but the way they did this time was Simply the BEST EVER.,10,1,3,18 May 2012
