Alien 3," The worst of the 3 aliens, but it's a legitimate part of the series.
","Yes this movie was the worst of the aliens trilogy, but I have always considered it a legitimate part of the aliens series.I mean look at Terminator 3... that's CLEARLY not part of the terminator series, its a slap in the face. I think the setting ( prison planet ) and the extremely dark / depressing tone of this movie is on the right track. There are also some gritty and realistic cyberpunk elements which should be given credit.So I'm not saying it's good, but it is part of the aliens trilogy. If you watch 1 & 2, You need to finish off with 3.Aliens 4 is not part of the series, it's just a cash-in on the franchise. Aliens 3 was not a cash-in attempt, it was just bad.",7,0,1,21 December 2009
