United 93," Flight 93 review from a highschool student
","Flight 93 directed by Paul Greengrass in 2006 is a historical drama that takes us to the events that led up to and what actually happened in september the 11th. This movie tells us of the people aboard flight 93 and how they and the US dealt with the hijacking issue. I give this film a 7/10 because of its acting and dialogue and its character development that the film represents throughout the film.Firstly, I will be examining acting and dialogue in the film. Throughout the film we see the actors showing us how they react to situations that are presented throughout the film. Dialogue from the movie was historically accurate and for this the movie represents correct historical information that not only informs the watcher of what happened but keeps us hooked with this dialogue. In the scene when they are making phone calls to their loved ones at home we can see how people acted and sense the horror that they went through.I will now be discussing character development in the film. Throughout the film we see characters learn and adapt the the situation. But as far as character development goes for seeing the characters go through hardships and and developing a new person towards the end of the film we see almost none of this. The characters don't change but throughout the film, only adapt to how I see any human being would adapt to the situation. Because of this lack in character development this film loses its chance at being a 10/10 movie so I give it 7/10.In conclusion, flight 93 takes us on board a historical journey that informs us about events that happened in the past. Flight 93 does this accurately and with good believable dialogue it lets us sense the tension in what was going on through the people aboard flight 93. However it failed to capture any sort of character development which did not allow us to capture how the people of flight 93 changed and evolved over the flight. Because of this I give this film a 7/10 because it accomplished bringing an accurate representation of what happened aboard flight 93 on september 11th.",7,0,1,22 January 2019
