The Rock," One must see, must buy movie of 1996
","I found this movie completely to be what every movie needs to be. Something for everyone.  Great actors (let's face it you can't go wrong with Sean Connery or Nicholas Cage), great story plot, and enough action to keep you in your seat from beginning to end.  Well worth watching again and again.",10,1,2,28 March 2000
The Blair Witch Project," One movie I'm glad I never paid to go see
","This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen.  All the talk about how scary it was peaked my curiousity enough to go rent it and I'm glad all I invested in it was a one day rental fee.  Can't believe the three people were that terrified, running and screaming, yet never, never put down the camera.  Give me a break, what a fake if I ever saw one.  Think this is the greatest 'put on' of all times.",1,3,5,28 March 2000
The Legend of 1900," And I thought I was going to be bored!!
","I am looking for this movie in the U.S., but we don't have it yet on home video.  Last night I watched it on satellite and I am going to watch it again and again.  Over here, it is listed as 'The Legend of 1900'.  This is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time.  The first scene when they are out to sea in a storm and he tells his new friend to take the brakes off the piano, is an extraordinary film footage.  Just fascinating. I can't wait until this comes to us in VHS and those of you who haven't watched it must catch it this month on Starz on satellite and I can guarantee you that you will thoroughly enjoy this one of a kind movie.",Null,0,0,17 April 2001
Titanic," If you're waiting for the special effects, you've got a long wait.
","After hearing several people talking about this particular movie and how many times they went back to see it, I bought the movie, watched it one time, put it away and have never gotten it back out again.  Granted everything was on a grand scale, good story-line, and somewhat interesting characters.  But I'm afraid the only thing most people (females) went again and again to see was Leonardo DiCaprio.  I enjoyed what special effects there were and had quite a long wait to see them and then it was over. Sorry, this wasn't one for me.",3,12,23,28 March 2000
The Sixth Sense," If you love a movie full of suspense and a twist on the ending, this is one to see.
","If you've seen the movie 'The Sixth Sense' at the theatre, I recommend that you buy the tape or the DVD and pick up on what the writer's and director have to say about 'rules and clues' in the movie, then watch it again.  I, for one, loved the suspense in the movie and was completely surprised by the ending.  What a unique twist on things and I didn't even catch on to it. Even the director thought that they had given away the twist on the ending during the scene when the boy is in the hospital speaking to Bruce Willis about the 'dead' and yet when they attended the premiere viewing, no one in the audience caught a thing and were all shocked at the end of the movie. Great job, great movie, a real must see even on tape.",Null,0,0,9 June 2000
