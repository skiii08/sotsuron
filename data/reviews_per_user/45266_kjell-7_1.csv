Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie made me feel like a kid again. Wow!
","The bad reviews about this movie tell me that the critics do not know how to sit back and enjoy. I went to the theater not expecting much and end up being blown away.  This was a simple story that was told visually at light speed.  I found myself staring at the screen with my mouth hanging wide open.  I felt like I had been transported to another galaxy, even if it was only for a couple of hours. Star Wars fan or not, go see this movie and just enjoy (and  forget about the critics).  I know that I am going to go again.",10,1,1,19 May 1999
