The Blair Witch Project," So-so
","No Boy Scout (or Girl Scout) can take this film seriously.  The basic premise of not being able to get out of the woods is wholly inconceivable to anyone who has enjoyed the benefits and perqs of being a kid and growing up in the Midwest or South.  To anyone not so privileged, the question might be, 'Why didn't they take their cell phones?'Unsettling (and that is largely due to jittery camera work) but insufficiently horrific for my taste.  A disappointment.",6,0,2,26 July 1999
Knives Out," Not Nearly As Much Fun As I had Hoped
","I was greatly underwhelmed by the film after reading so many highly positive reviews. Most of the actors are favorites of mine too, and they did what was expected of them, valiantly. But to me, the plot was tedious and the outcome predictable. I am sorry I rented it.",5,2,5,8 March 2020
The Mummy," Unattractive Elements
","Brendan Fraser is wonderful in what is essentially another comic book role, his own charm and sweetness managing to overpower some truly unpleasant distractions in the script.  Although the special effects are occasionally cheesy and threadbare by current standards, they are generally effective and do not distract from the fun.  What does spoil the movie, however, is the implicit racism in the film.  I was particularly bothered by the stereotyping of Arabs as dirty and stupid.  Certainly, this is a kind of anti-Semitism the world could do well enough without --- and so could this movie.",4,0,0,7 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Disturbing and Unsatisfying
","I am not as enraptured by this film as so many others seem to be.  I sensed a disturbing hollowness at its center, and I left the theater feeling as if my emotions had been manipulated.  I found it ugly and shabby. Beautifully photographed, though.",1,32,72,1 August 1998
Velvet Goldmine," Fantastic!
","An amazing and amazingly effective and affecting piece of cinema. This is entirely due to the generosity and courage with which Haynes shapes his highly idiosyncratic and personal approach to his art by exploiting all that is revealed in the sharpest rays of his flourescent psyche. For all its flamboyance, this is a film of great subtlety and high wit, not a dish for all palates.  Todd Haynes knows exactly what he's doing but it takes a smart audience to keep up with him.I give it a nine point five out of ten. Smashing, altogether smashing.",10,3,4,10 November 1998
From Dusk Till Dawn," Super Gore-Fest
","A wonderful, high-spirited vampire spoof that deserves to be taught in film schools for its masterful use of every clich√© of the genre without condescending to its audience.  George Clooney performs his role with style and a twinkle in his eye and Harvey Keitel deserves an award for his impersonation of a disillusioned cleric.  From Dusk to Dawn is a very witty and thoroughly enjoyable film.",9,5,7,4 July 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Celluloid Tedium
","If you like plots that use every know cliche while maintaining a pace that would be called sluggish if it didn't seem pretty close to torpid while serving as vanity displays for a preening half-pint actor who suddenly fancies himself an action hero, this thing is for you.  Otherwise, do yourself a massive favor and skip it.  What a yawn this turkey turned out to be.",1,1,2,21 July 2001
Midsommar," Wearisome
","Much too long and with less suspense than it fancies. To me it was simply the High Church remake of the 1973 version of Wicker Man, a far superior film in every regard. Worst of all, it is a waste of time.",3,2,5,9 March 2020
The Mummy Returns," Terrible!
","Badly acted, badly scripted, and the digital animation is possibly the worst in a major film for the past decade. Brendan Frasier seems bored and the other nonentities in this cast are simply going through the motions.  What a waste of time. There will be no 'The Mummy Always Rings Twice,' you can bet on it.",4,0,1,15 February 2002
Signs," Top Notch Thriller
","All right.  It's not perfect.  Mel Gibson is not the actor that Bruce Willis is.  Some plot issues are curiously unresolved.  Diabetics should be warned about the presence of supersweet child actors.  Joaquin Phoenix seems to have mastered one goofy expression for this role and had his face freeze in it.  The notion of a faith challenged parson is as trite as it is tedious.NONETHELESS, this film is as good a picture as any of us is likely to see this year.  The craft and artistry are nothing short of music for the eye and Shyamalan is fast becoming one of the finest directors presently working out of Hollywood.  Don't miss this movie.  It is simply superb.  Not perfect, just wonderful.",8,0,2,12 August 2002
