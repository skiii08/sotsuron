The Benchwarmers," Pretty Good Film, If you like Crude Humor.
","Definitely not a film, for kids though there is quite a bit of Childish and crude humor in the film. It's delivered well for the most part, with great performances by the leads. A lot of scenes with people getting hurt, so if you enjoy that kind of comedy you should enjoy this film. It was a little over the top in spots but overall it wasn't overly offensive. The only thing that really bugged me is Sean Salisbury's performance as one of the coaches. It just is so out of character for him. Non ESPN watchers shouldn't notice much of a problem however. Overall It's a pretty funny film with a lot of slapstick comedy.",8,0,4,8 April 2006
