Blade Runner 2049," What's this all about?
","This movie isn't about anything and the plot is baffling and uninteresting.This movie is merely a ploy to cash in on the success of the original, but it isn't even a SHIM of the original.Why oh why didn't they at least allow Vangelis to compose the music? He's still active and it would've made the movie so much better. Instead we get some unremarkable and forgettable generic synth rap.",3,5,9,7 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," JJ Abrams should be tarred and feathered
",Abrams should never be allowed to direct in Hollywood again. He ruined not one but TWO American iconic franchises: Star Wars AND Star Trek.Both were absolutely awful and I can't believe any studio would be willing to have him be creative director and producer on any of their priced franchises.Most likely Disney will simply cease producing Star Wars films for one or two decades before trying again and hoping for pent up demand,1,14,21,4 May 2020
Puss in Boots," Great movie
","Compelling storyline and all-in-all great fun for the entire family. I believe this movie to be a unsung jewel, as it didn't do too good at the box office.Too bad it didn't inspire a sequel, though it would have a tough time matching the original.",9,0,0,12 April 2020
