Sucker Punch," horrible movie
","HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MOVIE!!! Absolutely awful. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Zach Snyder is a fantastic director and I'm a fan of his previous work, but this movie was terrible. Their was no character development. Every character was flat. The story line made no sense and the general sense of realism and verisimilitude was non existent. People think that because special effects look cool, that it's a good movie. The ridiculous special effects and pointless action was almost unwatchable. I guess if you like dumb movies where you can leave your brain at the door and sit around like a brainwashed robot and look at visuals for 2 hours then this is your movie. If your actually into 'real' intelligent movies that actually convey story, mood and emotion, then don't see this movie because it lacks all that. The only thing this movie had was cool visual effects, but even the effects didn't fit with the wildly incoherent storyline. This movie along with other recent contemporary movies have really made me questionable as to where the future of the film industry is headed? Movies seem to get dumber and dumber as the years go by, it's a shame.",1,11,23,10 April 2011
Casablanca," movie review
","Great film. Humphrey Bogart really makes it. This movie is so exceptionally well done. The storyline in so complex but is conveyed in such a simple form. Bogarts character is so round that his emotions and character development is what makes this movie so complex but exhilarating. He starts off being carefree, doesn't care for anyone, Shows no concern towards death or the war and hates just about everyone. He's a true gambler. He's just a bar owner who only cares for himself. But then when he finds his true love the story twists to an entire new perspective and Bogart develops character, just something you have to see. Another exceptional feature to this film is the lighting, some of the darkest scenes are lit so appropriately. I also really enjoyed the mood that was conveyed in Casablanca, it was really fun to watch. Good photography, exceptional acting and a very developed story with twists and turns all over. Very good movie.",8,0,1,21 March 2011
Citizen Kane," The Movie
","Incredible. Citizen Kane is a true visual treat. Orson Wells is one of the greatest film directors of all time, you can see his intelligence just from watching Citizen Kane. And I have to say, the man is one hell of an actor as well! This is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. One outstanding feature to Citizen Kane is the astonishing cinematography. Gergg Toland the DP of this movie is truly the best. Not only does he bring outstanding lighting to the film but the shot composition is remarkable. The composition brings excellent stability along with depth and illusion. The Rule Of Thirds is used so incredibly. You'll see how they have shots where they line an actor on the left in the fore ground, another actor on the right of the screen in the middle ground and another actor all the way in the background. This easily conveys depth to the movie. Orson Wells has always been considered a very stylistic director both in film and theatrical plays. Many think Wells is all about style and not story, think what you want. In Citizen Kane, I don't think any other director could have done it other than Orson Wells. He not only brings his own style of filmmaking but tells an incredibly compelling story.",10,0,1,30 March 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," movie review
","This movie was excellent. Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is an epic western. These two badass train/bank thieves strive to disappear from the face of the law, but the law won't let them. This movie was a beautiful work of art. So intelligently made. The movie had excellent cinematography, and the gratuitous violence was so loose, so flexible it had 'New Hollywood' written all over it. The movies shot compositions were very creatively explored throughout the film. One of the best scenes is when Butch and Sundance Kid encounter Bolivian Indians who are trying to steal their money, the shootout is epic. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, I also loved the scene where Butch and Sundance's girl ride bikes together with the music playing in the background. It was intimate and so creative. I loved this movie.",10,1,2,13 May 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," movie review
","Great Movie. 'The Grapes Of Wrath' was known to be an outstanding novel. John Ford brings us his adaptation of it. This movie was so well done. One technical aspect was how great the photography looked, by cinematographer Gregg Toland, one of the best in the industry at that time period. John Ford gave this movie excellent direction, he conveyed good character development and the movie had movement and progression, both in the storyline, the core meaning and the character relationships. It's a sad movie made in 1940, but taking place in the 30's during the dust bowl, families are forced to migrate west to California in hopes of finding work. With thousands of families migrating, few can be accommodated. For the family of Tom Joad luck was rare. The emotions, mood and feeling that come from the very roundness and progressiveness is what makes this movie so desirable. Also the shot composition and lighting really helped me feel the mood of the story. 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a very realistic and sad story of man vs. law and man vs. society. It shows us how the best thing to do is to stick together with your loved ones and you'll get by. This was such and inspiring influential movie.",8,0,0,17 April 2011
Annie Hall," movie review
","This was a great movie. This was a Woody Allen Classic. Annie Hall was so unconventionally entertaining and humorous, like most of Allen's films Annie Hall combined screwball humor with romantic sexual jokes. This movie was amazing. The movie also had a very high end Manhattan artsy like feel to it. The shot composition was very independent like and the acting and overall mood of the movie had Manhattan all over it. It's always funny how an artsy New York Movie can look so different in terms of style compared to a higher budget box office hit, usually shot in California. This movie also had Allen's style written all over it. Classic lack of invisibility. Allen loves to play it out as if he's aware of the camera the entire time, sometimes even narrating to it randomly. In Annie Hall you'll see some examples of this, their is no real definitive line between the films diegesis, in some scenes. He also played out Annie Hall as if he plays himself and his everyday life and a camera is documenting him and his relationship with Annie. It's fascinating actually how unconventional Woody Allen's style is, but it always works. Not to mention the movie had very artsy photography and hilariously absurd humor, like usual I'd expect nothing less coming from Woody Allen. Genius.",10,0,0,29 April 2011
The Graduate," movie review
","This was a great movie. Ben Braddock played by Dustin Hoffman is a college graduate who ends up getting into a sexual relationship with his mother's friend Mrs. Robinson. This movie was made right after the Hays Code era and for good reason. This movie added to the definition of 'New Hollywood' Sexually suggestive themes, partial nudity, swearing and overall morals that said go against the system. The music also had an awesome soundtrack, primarily Simon and Garfunkel. The movie was so well done. The movie was technicolor, shot in 35mm panavision. The cinematography was amazing. The movie had incredibly unconventional angles and even some shots were the camera would remain stationary and people would walk off and all you can notice is people talking out of the shot. I think after the code, it was a breath of fresh air for collaborating filmmakers, because so many films were made that would have never been approved anywhere before 1967.",9,1,2,13 April 2011
Singin' in the Rain," movie review
","great movie. Fabulous. A visual sensation. This movie was made in 1952 but takes place around 1927 in the film industry. This movie is both educational about films at that time and also intriguing with an excellent storyline. The movie is so visually mesmerizing, outstanding mise- en-scene along with superb choreography and singing. A true musical sensation. Also the visual illusions of the movie are not only imaginative but also very creative. The film also had an excellent sound track to mix with the singing of the film. By far the best musical ever made because it's more than just a musical, it's a story as well. This film combines excellent direction and story progression along with astonishing camera and lighting techniques, great acting and dancing, choreography and music to combine and create an outstanding musical film.",9,0,1,30 March 2011
Psycho," Movie review
","One of the most influential and innovative horror films ever made!! Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho shows us all just how great of a filmmaker he really was. Strictly one of his best. This movie goes beyond conventional styles of horror films and brings us into the mind of Hitchcock himself. The movie has an exceptional storyline. The movie also does something exceptional that most horror films seem to always lack, CHARACTER RELATIONSHIP! The movie conveys an excellent stylistic form of really working on the characters. Working on them in such a way that we as the audience can actually grow attached to them. So if something happens to a character in Psycho we as the audience actually feel emotion towards these characters and can really relate to it all. This sense of attachment to the characters and our relationships to them is what draws us that much closer to the movie. That's why Psycho is so scary! Most horror movies show us characters in which we don't know so when something scary and bad happens to them, we could care less. In fact we usually just say 'wow, that guy was so stupid for going off alone.' We don't say that in Psycho. This movie actually scares us, we don't feel that the characters are dumb at all. I really found this style so fascinating. Also this movie had one of the most classic horror shower scenes of all time! One other thing I noted when watching this movie was how well Hitchcock developed the core of the entire story. The movie had an excellent core meaning to it and also showed development, progression and movement. Excellent movie. Hitchcock is a legend and so is this movie.",10,0,0,4 April 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," movie review
","This was a crazy movie. Jack Nicholson plays the protagonist, a man who ends up in a mental health facility. They believe he's not crazy at all, that he's just doing all this to get out of working a job. But only watching the movie can tell you what happens. All I can say is that it was crazy. As far as technical work goes, the movie had very omniscient and interesting photography. The movie also had a few good subjective shots. But what really made this movie was how round Jack Nicholson's character was. This movie was a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie combined. The story progression on top of Nicholson's character just made a crazy dramatic thriller. Also every nurse in the movie was so cold and eerie, especially nurse Ratchet, she was so cold and had such an eerie personality, it just helped build the overall uneasiness of the movie. This was a good movie.",9,1,2,14 April 2011
