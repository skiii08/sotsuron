The Blair Witch Project," Too much hype
","I eagerly awaited the arrival of 'Blair Witch' to the theater and excitedly went last week.  I was so upset with the movie.  I think that there might have been too much hype surrounding the movie, because I guess I expected it to be spectacular but instead found it boring.  Nothing was really scary and the end, which everyone told me was spell-binding, left me wondering, 'Thats it?  Its over?'  The movie focuses more on the conflict between the film makers than the witch.  What a let down!",1,1,2,26 August 1999
