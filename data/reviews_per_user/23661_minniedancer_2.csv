E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Most Amazing Film Ever
","I first saw E.T when I was about 8. To me it was just like any other film, I didn't cry or laugh and to be honest it scared me a bit. Then when I was 16, I sat down to watch it and I have not been the same since. It was INCREDIBLE. I started out laughing, then the music gave me a lump in my throat and before I knew it I was sobbing uncontrollably and I did for most of the day. E.T can move even the most intense and cynical of people and make them remember how truly beautiful life can be. The Cast is fabulous, with admirable performances by Mcnaughton and Barrymore, but Henry Thomas gives a performance like no other in this, film acting way beyond his years. The films central relationship is the kind of friendship that is envied by us all. John Williams's music is beautifully adapted to story telling and it moves you to such an extent you can't think about anything else all day. So if you haven't seen this film, you haven't lived. I don't care if you're a tiny child, a moody teenager or an old age pensioner. This is without a doubt the most magical film ever, it completely changed my perspective on life and if you haven't seen it then see it now.10/10.",10,2,4,26 December 2006
Jaws," It is as if God created the devil and gave him...Jaws.
","Amazing film and definitely deserved more Oscars. From start to finish, superb direction from Spielberg with some terrifying moments brought to life and sends shivers up the spine. The dynamic trio of Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss allows us to access laughter, terror, love and every emotion possible which is often hard to do in a thriller like this. The Effects are excellent with a shark that looked realistic enough for me! Some people have criticised it and said that it would be better if done by CG but as in the case of Spielberg's other masterpiece E.T sometimes creating the actual model itself brings the best out of actors. But for me what was personally responsible for most of the film's success was the chilling score which becomes the voice and character of the shark. A well deserved Oscar for John Williams.",10,0,1,20 April 2007
