Miracle," fun movie
","not sure why others seem so critical of this fun movie. of course, if you are over 40years as i am, the recollection is vivid. nonetheless, there is always room to just recall, forget about the woes of our current lack of soviet opposition, and reminisce.acting is fine, supporting cast is even better. the story is so good, how can't you enjoy?personally, i covered this team when i was in college, and remember predicting that they'd win the gold medal. there was something that they had that transcended our mere human existence, and you could palpate it! there is nothing on screen that could possibly best that, and it is unreasonable to expect such. for those under 40years old, this might be a reasonable facsimile to the real thing since they could not possibly have that experience to have drawn upon.",Null,2,4,7 November 2004
