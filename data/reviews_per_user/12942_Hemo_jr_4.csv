Source Code," Very Cool
","This is an amazing movie. It pulls together a lot of the cooler concepts in physics (some of which are not directly articulated). Ideas such as quantum theory, Schrodinger's cat, and the many-worlds interpretation are combined with locked-in syndrome and the idea that human consciousness and memory itself exists as a quantum construct and can be manipulated as such.The above is the smoke and mirrors that make up the story-telling part of movie magic. And few movies are as deft doing this as _Source Code_. Fewer still are movies that achieve the depth of verisimilitude this one does in using possible implications of real scientific ideas. Once the movie postulates its ideas, it does a wonderful thing. It treats them logically. The movie resides within the rigid framework of that logic. As a long time s-f reader and movie fan, seeing the screenwriters, director, actors and all involved actually having the discipline to do this is very special.The movie then adds a thriller plot, compelling characters, actors that make us care about those characters, romance and a resolution that is emotionally gratifying. That is why I rate _Source Code_ 10 out of 10. If there is a better movie to come out his year, I would be shocked and gratified. I would be happily surprised if there was even one other movie this year that approached being as good as 'Source Code_.",10,0,2,17 April 2011
Star Trek," This is simply the best SF movie ever made
","Watching _Star Trek_ this weekend was an amazing experience. It is not only extremely well written, acted and had amazing effects, but it tugged at emotional chords so long forgotten, I did not realize they were there. I was 13 and an avid SF fan in the Fall of 1966 when I first saw the television version of 'Star Trek' -- and as anyone connected with SF will tell you, 13 is the golden age of Science Fiction. 'Star Trek' was actually good, its universe was well thought out and it attracted not just good TV writers, but good SF writers. When 'Star Trek' looked like it might be canceled after the second season, I joined in the letter writing campaign to NBC to get it renewed for a third season. And when the third season was such a disappointment, I gathered up my feelings, put them in a box and buried them.Watching _Star Trek_ 2009, that box of feelings burst out that box. This was not merely 'Star Trek' revisited, or a new and improved 'Star Trek', but 'Star Trek' perfected. It was 'Star Trek' with all the lightning captured in the bottle. I was proud, I was happy, I feel shivers and goosebumps multiple times, I was in awe of what was on the screen. Seeing Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu et al. in such heroic circumstances being more heroic than ever before was amazing. And the Enterprise, itself, coming out of warp drive with phasers blazing and photon torpedoes shooting to save the day was an emotional catharsis. I had to deliberately calm myself on several occasions._Star Trek_ is a good movie even disregarding the emotional strings it plucked for me. If anyone actually came to this movie cold (born in a box and never let out 'til now?) they would come away from it with the sense they had seen great entertainment. The story, the characters, the visual and emotional impact of the movie all came together here.Now for a few minor nits that could have been picked by paying attention to science adviser on the movie. Eta Carinae is the perfect candidate for a supernova, it could have been mentioned by name. A planet in another solar system may have had its surface sterilized and its atmosphere blown away, but it is doubtful it would disintegrate completely. The sequence and timing of a supernova and its effects could have been mapped out a bit better. A class M planet so near Vulcan so as to see it as a fairly large disk in the sky would make it and Vulcan a double planet. But overall the movie paid more attention to science here than I am used to (kudos for that, as well). Also, the Bones character was heard in situations a ship's doctor would not normally he heard -- apparently just to let him say some of his more annoying catch phrases from the original TV series.On Memorial Day weekend in 1977, _Star Wars_ was released. It made previous all science fiction films look pale and sickly in comparison. This Mother's Day weekend 2009 history repeats itself with the movie _Star Trek_. This _Star Trek_ movie stands head and shoulders above all SF movies before it. It is simply the best SF movie ever made.",10,4,13,15 May 2009
No Country for Old Men," Anton Chigurh = Michael Myers
","After seeing this movie, I was impressed with the fact that Anton Chigurh was just too lucky, and indestructible to be believable. Then it dawned on me, Anton Chigurh is Michael Meyers! True, 'No Country for Old Men' was a much better movie than 'Halloween', but there is still the striking similarity in how each movie's villain not only embodies evil, but apparently cannot be killed and is an unrelenting force of nature.The writers also seem to be unable to bring the story line to a resolution. What is even the point of the Ed Tom Bell character? Apparently he is simply a red herring. And the comment early in the movie about 'the last man standing' is also misleading and a misuse of foreshadowing. Apparently an unresolved storyline makes up for the lack of realism elsewhere in the movie.It may not seem like it, but i liked the movie. But it just is not Oscar caliber. 'Michael Clayton' is a much better movie with a deft touch for character that is exceedingly rare. And 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is a better movie overall, but it not mentioned as an award contender.",6,2,4,22 January 2008
The Queen," Barely Passable as a TV Movie
","After seeing this movie, I was struck how it reminded me of a made for TV movie. The subject was boring, the acting pedestrian and there were no great insights. The fact that this movie garnered a number of nominations and awards in the US is a mystery that can only be explained by an unhealthy preoccupation of the academy with things British. I will concede that the subject matter might be significantly more interesting for those native to the British Isles or those obsessed by Royalty. But to those outside of those categories, this movie offers little.",4,3,5,12 March 2012
