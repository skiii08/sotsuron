Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas does not disappoint
","I do not consider myself a major Star Wars fan, having seen only parts of the original trilogy.  But I must admit that this movie left me with a sense of awe.  The Star Wars saga really comes alive with this movie.  I loved seeing the Jedi Knights at a time of peace and prosperity.  The character of Obi-Wan Kenobi was portrayed very well, and the fight choreography was spectacular.  Most of the humor was created for a younger audience, and the violence mostly involves robot droids being sliced and diced.  But this movie shows that a film does not have to have gut-splattering violence to be a successful sci-fi action picture.  Incidently, the computer-generated animation was spectacular.By the way, has anyone noticed that George Lucas has not released a single television advertisement for THE PHANTOM MENACE?  As of this writing, the only ads on TV are the shameless promotions of three fast food companies utilizing pieces of musical score and prop leftovers.  I might say this lack of organized exposure was another tribute to Lucas's genius, but I'd rather wait and see the weekend totals for the movie before being so bold.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
