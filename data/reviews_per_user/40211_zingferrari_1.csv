Hereditary," Do not waste your money on this!!
",Unbelievable slow snorefest is the best way I can describe this.Laughable storyline a death that doesn't involve the police being called? How would this even happen? Suspend belief and accept this could happen and how do you explain the son not receiving any psychiatric help at all?The movie bumbles along albeit well acted in parts and then rushes a truly pointless ending. Perhaps the back story should be explored as a better starting point?But given the pacing of this 'horror' use the term lightly perhaps be better if left alone and forgotten.,1,1,6,23 August 2018
