Requiem for a Dream," shockingly good 9/10
","i really liked this film, not in the sense of it being enjoyable but it is thought provoking and amazing visually and musically.  It isn't at all a nannying look at drug addiction which it could so easily have been.  The characters are likeable and their demise is disturbing.  The film is about addiction in general but more specifically drug addiction, some of the drug taking scenes with the time lapse camera work and pumping music are exillarating and the more downbeat scenes with string quartet music over beats are inspiring.  This film is better than pi, which was very good indeed but a struggle to watch, Pi assaulted the senses a bit much (intentionally) for me.",9,0,0,3 February 2001
Fight Club," A dark, atmospheric, crazy film.
","Fight club is mind blowing the first time you watch it.  Walking out of the cinema after watching it was a strange experience, a comedown to reality. And watching it for the second time brings across the cleverness of the film.  The first viewing is emotionally stimulating and further viewings are intellectually stimulating in my view.  Here's why:
The film has a great atmosphere-this comes across fromi-the dark locations filmed inii-the excellent soundtrack which is deep and unintrusive, almost subliminal.iii-the central place given to the 'darker' sides of human nature.In this context however, the darker sides of human nature are one result of our consumption driven society, stereotyped in the film.  It is necessary to experience these sides of our nature to escape from this to a future free of inclinations created solely from our environment.  Or this is how the film comes across to me.The film's message is powerful but I can't help thinking that it goes too far the other way in its exploration of a cliche.  It has similarities to American Psycho.  (Bret Easton Ellis praised the book if I remember rightly) But in both these films/book the characterisation of a material possessio n frenzy seems over the top, although it is more of a satire in American Psycho.The film is effective in portraying how we are, to an extent, a product of our society and its conventions and our possessions but I take the view with films that they also bring us away from reality.  Films form part of the experiences we are constructed of and we need to look critically at what the film is trying to make us feel.The film is amazing on the second viewing because its cleverness really comes across.  Without giving anything away, I thought it wouldn't be coherent when watching it again after knowing the ending.  However it does work, requiring only a fairly small amount of suspension of disbelief.
Fight club deserves a nine, it was the best film of the year, if not longer.",9,0,1,25 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," terrible 5/10
","i was so dissappointed with this film.  I don't understand why it has had consistently high ratings and good reviews.  The script was terrible.  Maybe it was the translation but if the lines had been said in english, it would have been laughable.  Some fighting was good but this is never enough to make a film and is not even necessary",5,0,0,3 February 2001
Pi," excellently disturbing
","this film is pretty good.  The way the camera flashes around and the sound provides a very disturbing atmosphere which although at times becomes irritating, is an essential part and aim of the film.  This is a dark film and I look forward to more by this director.  It reminds me slightly in atmosphere of eraserhead by David Lynch but is much better.",8,1,2,18 January 2001
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," 7/10 repulsive film
","i don't think I got the point of this film.  I appreciate it has a message about fascism.  I found most poignant the part where the fascist made the point that the degradation of others is a pleasure for them because basically they take pleasure in 'them rather than us' being in pain, or thats how i understood it.  But i just found it sickening to watch, i really wish i hadn't watched it.  I can imagine horrific things in my mind but the visual effect of them is just disturbing.  All i took away from this film is a hatred of torture and degradation but i already had this hatred before hand.",7,2,3,3 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," definately not the greatest movie ever
","I grew up watching this film and it is one of the most amazing and fun films, if not the most.  But to judge a film just by these criteria is ridiculous.  The story isn't anything special, the acting is rubbish.  It's special effects are amazing, but maybe this just signalled the start of films being purely driven by special effects, which is certainly a bad thing(in my opinion).  I really love this film, it is fun, and i love it mainly because I watched it so many times as a child.  But If I saw it now for the first time, I would think it was rubbish.  It's a kids film",Null,1,2,24 March 2001
The Godfather," An epic masterpiece
","After having watched the Godfather countless times, I have to say that it is (along with the rest of the trilogy) the best film/series of films I've ever seen.  My comments are on the series of films as a whole.Here are my main reasons for this assertion:1-The complexity of the plot which draws one in to an involvement with the film without the complexity being just for its own sake.2-The depth of characterisation of Michael.  The way he seems to inevitably to get sucked into something deep and serious when he initially seems ashamed of the family 'business'.3-The interlinking of scenes from present and past which adds something emotionally at certain points in the film. (eg. the flashback of Michael telling his family about him joining the army)4-the music which creates an amazing and authentic atmosphere.
parts 1 and 2 merit a 10 and part 3 a 9. (part three is better than some have suggested I think)",10,0,1,25 November 2000
