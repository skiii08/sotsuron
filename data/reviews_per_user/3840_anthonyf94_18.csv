The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Interesting universe with weak characters
","In the universe defined by the previous films, the story is now more focused on what is true in a system that is based on lies and illusions. This configuration of the society, Orwellian, deforms all human relationships and Katniss can be not more conscious of what Peeta is and thinks. So an atmosphere in all similar to the previous chapters (but with a movement toward the rebellion argument) is at the service of love story between Katniss and Gale or Peeta: the ambiguity of this strange triangle is very bad defined and the decisions of the main characters seem to be taken for contingent choices and can't react positively with the dystopian ambient. As the other films, good entertainment but with weak personalities and in general a movie rated really too much for what it really is: 'alternative' commercial cinema.",6,0,2,27 August 2019
The Expendables 2," Same concept of the first chapter
","All 'Mercenari' Saga have to be taken as a Hollywood party between Stallone and his friends. Not superficially, this is the most interesting of the movie, the fact that we take unconsciously all the characters of these films not as characters but as actors, in the sense that Stallone is present as Stallone, and so Schwarzenegger or Willis or Norris. So, the most interesting is the fact that the icon defeat the character, and reason of the movie is just to see, with irony and auto-celebrating consciousness, what happens if we find all Hollywood machos in the same war.For the rest, the movie is pure entertainment, and a collection of fights and explosions. There are a lot of worse movie in this genre and we can take this one as a unnecessary but pleasant divertissment.",6,0,0,25 August 2019
Captain Marvel," I love Nine Inch Nails - but just them
","On a thematic level, this movie tries to deal with questions like morality and war, lies and teams and the difficulty of understanding who are the good ones and who the bad ones. But all of this is showed in a confused way that is in line with the unfocused plot and character: if the idea was to use a superhero with his powers since from the start of the movie (without discovering them) and break with the now traditional scheme (discovering-learning-fighting), the result is still imprecise and not so attractive. On the MCU level, moreover, this appears really nothing more than an appendix: there are no epical fights, and the usefulness of this chapter result really hard to understand. In generale the movie is not too much terrible, but the fact that the most interesting thing is the Nine Inch Nails' shirt demonstrates how this movie is anonymous. Maybe the most anonymous of the entire saga.",5,2,6,6 November 2019
This Is the End," Surrealistic Seth Rogen
","Who knows Seth Rogen knows how kind of movies he writes: funny american comedies about mad actions and marijuana. In this movie he brings this principle on a metaphysical and surrealistic level: building a reality-like scenery (actor interpret themself with their own names), the plot turns rapidly in a catastrophic movie in which James Franco, Seth Rogen and others have to survive in their house while outside there's an alien or demoniac invasion (we don't know a lot). Mad and funny in his eccentric develop. Rogen's '8 1/2'? Yes, in a certain sense, as a meta-cinematographic opera. But it's still Seth Rogen.",6,1,2,25 August 2019
The Terminator," The perfect killing's desire
","Terminator represents the fundamental fear of sci-fi era: the war between men and machines and the victory of robots. With a dynamic, fluid, pop style (wonderful electronic soundtrack), and atmosphere of anxiety due to the darkness, Cameron manages to create the most terrible menace for men about technology: a Terminator, a machine come from the future to destroy humans. And the machine can't be dropped: the difference from humans is properly in its incapacity to understand emotion and to understand limits; if it's created for destroy, if it understands just the obligation to live better (and for this also killing creators, seen as weak and imperfect), nothing can't defeat it, and the last scene, with the Termination disposed to fight until it can reveals this strange creepy strength that comes not from willing but from a mechanical rationality and program. A cult for sci-fi world, but also in its pop nature full f philosophical contents.",8,0,1,2 December 2019
Fast & Furious 6," Racers Avengers
","The sixth chapter of the 'Fast and Furiou' saga continues the concept of the last two chapters, so it's configured as a generic action movie without the concentration on street racers like in the firsts movie. This means that, as all the chapters after the third, risk to make the saga just an action saga like another million in the world. Infact, in this sixth episode, in which a kind of Avengers of racers have to defeat his nemesis made by analogue criminal group (and the trait d'union is Letty on the other side because of her amnesy), races are introduced just as a spectacular element, useless for the plot, as in the fifth. The scenes with supercars are simply fights against police, and could be done also with normal cars. Moreover, the dialogues are full of infodumps and unmotivated rhetoric (especially the family one, sometimes really annoying), the characters few analyzed. In conclusion, an action movie sometimes funny sometimes bad done, anonymous as a lot of other films of this genre. You can also not call it 'Fast and furious', like you could for the previous movie.",6,0,2,5 September 2019
Shrek Forever After," Matrix-like Shrek
","The fourth chapter of Shrek saga is based on the desire of the main character to see how it could be a life without wife and kids. But the magician that brings him in an alternative life, after the first joy, shows how the world could be bad without his family love. A surrealist passage between alternative futures is the most interesting of this movie, that's also, however, a little weak and without the great sketches of the first two films.",6,0,1,11 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Too tarantinian to be a Tarantino
","This movie is often received as something different from other Tarantino's movie, so there are lots of people that don't appreciate it. In my opinion, instead, even if it isn't too much à là Tarantino because of there aren't too action and dynamic scenes, it is the regular result of the citation theme of Tarantino's movies.All the film is based on this opposition: Bill and Rick. The first one is a double, the second is the real actor, in a moment of decline. They live near Sharon Tate and the place in which Charles Manson killed her. Now, the opposition generates this situation: the real actor can't live well in the real world (he is in decline, he doesn't manage to reach the great Hollywood as he wants), the double, that's the fake actor in movies, but does the real dangerous scenes (instead Rick avoid them), is able to live in the world (does material tasks, killed his wife, fights and wins against Bruce Lee, that, moreover, is an actor revealed in his weakness outside the set).This mechanism guides the story to a series of situations in which Bill, even if he his who works behind the real actor, manages to do what he wants to do. Until the murder scene: hippies enter in his home and have a fight with him, losing. Also this scene is based on opposition between reality and fiction: the killers, in fact, say that they want to kill the people that teached them to kill, so the actors; at the same time Bill, that had a Lsd dose, thinks that's cruel reality that is happening is just a drug effect (amazing that scene in which he and the killer are one in front of the other, the killer with a real gun, he with a gun made with fingers); moreover all the fight is had between murderers and the double, even if they reached Rick, that instead is in the garden and his action is to kill the hippy with a weapon from a cinematographic set.So, all these things and others (it is the double that goes to the hospital; Tate's murder is leaves outside the movie's space etc.) suggest how strong is this opposition between reality and fiction, that's the typical condition of tarantinian art: the citational system, that's not just a game, but is analyzed in its minimal composition, thought as an estethic question and at the same represented as a concrete mechanism of violence and degradation (of '60s Hollywood, that's showed with a great historical fidelity).",8,3,7,6 October 2019
Room," All of us came from a window in the rooftop
","'Room' isn't just a film about a rape; it is a film about the dialectic of experience of the world, about the perception of reality. Surely the dramatic case of a woman kept in a room for years, and raped, especially if we think that's a real story, creates empathetic feelings for us; but this point is also a way to explore how a kid - taken just as a new born human being - can build his own mythology basing his considerations on what he can find in his world, that's simply a microscopic room. After the exit the difficulty to consolidate human relationships demonstrates the delicate period of exploration of another world that doesn't necessarily coincide with the first one. A movie that mix psychological topics (the strange relationship between mother and son outside their constricted but familiar world) with metaphysical questions about origin and kantian demands about perception of reality. Amazing.",8,1,2,21 August 2019
The Lion King," The money's circle (but what a great computer graphic)
","I'm not a fan of the live-action recent Disney trendy. (Even if this movie is all in computer graphic, it can be considered part of the last live-action Disney works, for its photographic fidelity and for the historical moment of its creation). I think that's just a way to earn money using things that the audience already know, love and often associate to his childhood. But the enormous production behind this works (we are still talking about Disney) makes the movie interesting for the eyes. This, in reality, is maybe its only (huge) advantage; for the rest it repeats the original plot and also loses characters vivacity. A good movie for eyes, almost useless for the rest.",7,1,1,10 September 2019
Puss in Boots," There's no tripe for cats
","After four movies on the main character, 'Shrek''s saga turns on one of the most popular mascot of the franchise: Puss in boots. But the spin-off that represents him doesn't catch all the play of references and parodies that shapes the shrekian concept, and the pastiche that would have to be the point of arrival is just alluded, with the mix the histories of Puss, Humpty Dumpty and the magic beans. The result is an anonymous film sanza infamia e sanza lode, that follows more or less all the stereotypes of the adventure 'for kids': the journey, the betrayal, the redemption toward love. It affects, at most, the rancor that can be hatched inside of what at first seemed to be the best friendship; but the pale result reveals how the Puss character works well, instead, only near Shrek and company.",5,0,0,18 August 2019
Sicario," Law and morality: not a coincidence
","While a lot of action/war/thriller movies are produced in stereotypical and commercial ways, 'Sicario' manages to mix action entertainment with a real psychological detecting. The difference between two kind of police agent groups, that have to work together, bring the the relation between them to fight against law or moral sense. The main protagonist is a woman that thinks police as an activity all based on the respect of laws: attending this different group for a mission in a cruel Mexico, she discovers the fact that other policemen acts for justice but often using their ways, destroying strict rules or also mixing job with personal revenge. The evolution of Blunt's character is all played inside this space of not coincidence between law and morality, and the difficult to understand what is really good to do. The movie passes in a series of cigarettes and psychological problems, without a univocal solution.",8,0,1,15 September 2019
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Dystopian but no fear
","This second chapter rewrites more or less the first one, with an apocalyptic fights in the arena. As in the first one, the quality of this saga is in the group of specific symbols and atmospheres that are those of a well defined universe. But this good elements are not at the service of a well done narrative development, that goes without an anxious feeling that instead should be in a dystopian world like this. Characters reactions are not guided by serious fears or sorrows and all the protagonists results static: the interesting dystopian place described is not impregnated by a terrible feeling that instead we have to expect. In this second movie, moreover, the love plot is more presented but, for the same reasons now expressed, it sounds artificial and moralistic, without a real deraglement of the feelings in a horrible situation like the Hunger Games one. Terribly overrated, as the first one.",6,0,0,27 August 2019
Green Book," Behind black and white
","Story of a black musician and a white bodyguard, 'Green book', through the archaic system of trip and adventures during it, is based on the opposition between this two characters that discover to like each other beyond the differences of status and skin that society stresses. The particularitg is in the fact that the white man is of asocial condition less higher than the black man's one, that's instead a rich and famous pianist. This strange condition, for 60s racist USA, brings the protagonist to a tragedy of not being part of a defined group: he is richer than other black men but always different, for the skin, from 'real' white people; so his dramatic situation is to be outside of all of categories. Through ironical and light expedients, the movie condemns racism but also understand complexity of psychological lifes behind conventional social divisions, and, even if for wasn't the best movie of that year to win the Oscar, it is appreciable and original.",7,1,3,11 November 2019
Minions," The law of the strongest (and of those around him)
","The intuition belongs just to the firsts two chapters of the saga. 'Minions' works like more or less all the mascot spin-offs: his aim is confirm to the audience the reason of the mascot's success. So 'Minions' is none other than a tracking shot of gags, supported by the fact that the yellow little monsters have to reach the despicable and associate with him. The most interesting element is in this archetypical need of survive and fraternization with the strongest specie: something of cruelly Darwinian is hidden behind the small banana-lovers. But for the rest, the line is weak: a movie to take for what it is, a funny tribute to a character impossible not to love. With also some undercurrent philosophical hint.",6,0,0,18 August 2019
Incredibles 2," Superheroes and superparents
","After fifteen years, Incredibles come back to show their powers and their familiar problems. In a world that doesn't accept superheroes (in the same way of X-Men), these incredible creatures have to hide themself and destroy their impulse to help society. The occasion that makes Elastigirl able to become again a great superheroine, and to obtain the rights' recognizing for superheroes, makes also Mr. Incredibile deal with his problematic children and with the most difficult superpowers: managing a family.It is in these coordinates that the movie goes on, putting this family against a villain that use screens to influence people (a strong critic to modern society) but also against the risk of disintegration. Jack-Jack and his numerous powers isn't only an instruments for funny sketches, but also a kind of symbolism of difficulty of dealing with powers.So, wonderful graphics and a story that's interesting for enlightenment of backstages of superheroes and their quotidian problems, make this movie appreciable, especially considering that's a sequel. Maybe it could be a little shorter and a little more precise in narrative evolution, but surely it deserves to be watched.",7,2,3,9 October 2019
The Martian," Robinson Crusoe in interstellar era
","In this movie Matt Damon goes to be alone of new Robinson Crusoe: after an accident during a mission, he remains on Mars and their colleagues think he's dead. Instead, he has to try to live on Mars and to invent solutions to survive using what he finds. Fortunately he's a botanic scientist and manages to create crops and to eat potatoes.This interesting idea open to a reflection on techniques: human being is configured as the technological being, and it's work is creation of artificial stuff. The fact that Mars is inhospitable, makes this process a sort of foundation, a sort of creation of a new civilization that is born from human faith on technological world.This interesting reflection on relation between man, techniques and nature (but with a too clear positivism), however, is not developed with the deepening that I would love to see: beyond a lot of infodumps, there's a no-problematized condition of man in a terrible desert. He's activity is not quite put in dialogue with fear of death and desperation and the final is too easy. In conclusion, for me is a good movie, but if it was thought with a bigger consideration of risks and madness, it would has been better.",7,1,2,27 September 2019
Furious 7," When has Vin Diesel become Hulk?
","Surely the sad final with the metaphoric departure of Paul Walker hit everyone that loved this saga, when he was a child and watched the firsts movie.But beyond this touching tribute, we have to see, critically, what's this movie factually is. And it is, as the lasts chapters, an anonymous action movie that on a side lost all his race characteristics (supercars are introduced just as a spectacular elements, without an unchangeable role in the plot) and on the other risks to lose itself in the sea of mediocre action movies. The introduction of Jason Statham confirms officially this evolution as before did the entrance of Dwayne Johnson. And in fact the movie is full of long, predictable fights with or without arms where those that in the firsts film were pilots now are kind of ninja or 007: I really don't understand how Dominic Toretto can raise a car just with his hands or destroy the street with the foot.In conclusion, the movie is a sufficient action, that forgets the most part of its supercar movie and concentrate all its efforts producing a commercial 'sparatutto', with all the negative points of a entertaining movie (bad dialogues, annoying irony, superficial characters etc).",6,0,0,5 September 2019
