Ford v Ferrari," A fun outing, solid throughout
","Just back from the theater after seeing Ford vs. Ferrari and it's totally enjoyable. It never dragged and never really felt rushed either. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are two of the most watchable moviestars we have on hand these days, and their interaction can easily be seen as the bedrock of the movie.The racing scenes? We get pretty well all you could wish from the famous 1966 races at Daytona and LeMans where the Ford GT Mk II made its mark in racing history. I think in screen time they add up to almost an hour's worth of the 2:32 runtime of the movie, and they're filmed as well as (or better than) any other racing movie I can think of. Full disclosure here though: I personally think auto racing is obscene most of all because of its flagrant waste of fossil fuels, and anyone who argues that it's responsible for all kinds of auto design improvements is just blowing smoke. If and when this whole sport dies its inevitable death, good riddance.But OK, this is a movie review -- how about the cast? Matt Damon is just fine as always. He doesn't exactly have 'range' -- he just plays himself in any movie (like Tom Cruise) -- but that's just fine. I have no idea if Carrol Shelby is really like that, but Damon is so comfortable and engaging in whatever he does that it always works. Christian Bale is much more of a technician, a method actor, and I'm sure he worked hard to nail the eccentric Ken Miles, the race driver and engineer/mechanic who values the pure experience of the business on absolute terms. It's fascinating to see him work.Two or three of the minor parts stand out. Catriona Balfe (best known for 'Outlander') plays Miles' wife and gives her some depth -- much more than just a placeholder. And Tracy Letts (as Henry Ford II), Jon Bernthal (as a young Lee Iacocca) and Josh Lucas (as the smarmy, vindictive corporate suit Leo Beebe) are all good. I don't have any idea how much of the infighting and scheming within the Ford corporation shown here is realistic, though I suspect much of it must be fictionalized to amp up the drama. But it makes for an engaging night out. Have fun!",7,2,5,17 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Science fiction film as art
","In the last few years we've been treated to a string of superb sf films that have totally penetrated into the mainstream: Inception, Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian, Arrival, and now Blade Runner 2049. (Notice that two of these are by Christopher Nolan, and two by Denis Villeneuve. No coincidence!) These are exceptional -- not just the idea-driven stories that good sf films usually are, but high-production works with first rate actors that in some cases are nothing less than works of art.Blade Runner 2049 fits 'work of art' very well indeed. For me the essence of it was not the story line so much as the ambiance of this doomed world and its visual presentation. The original Blade Runner (1982) had the same emphasis, but this new one spends more time away from the ugly, crowded ground-level city streets, in favor of bleak landscapes and overwhelming Metropolis-style architecture that the shadowy controllers operate from.And bleak it certainly is. The city-scapes and landscapes are about as dystopian as you can imagine from beginning to end: supremely ugly ruined factories, bare fogbound lands with dead trees, red windswept deserts. The only change of pace is not much help: geometrically clean and superficially beautiful interiors where this society's rulers carry out their genetic programming with the Replicants that they hope will save the future. A single scene of a sunlit green forest turns out, agonizingly, to be a simulation, and it just drives home the point that simple greens and blues are almost totally absent from the color palette of this movie.The music score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch is similarly monumental. Landscape scenes in which nothing is really happening are accompanied by massive, foreboding music that becomes a feature in itself. This reminded me a bit of Arrival, where Villeneuve uses Johan Johanssen's score for similar purposes. (A surprisingly fun contrast to this persistently grim mood is offered, oddly enough, by the ring tone on K's phone, which we hear several times when someone is trying to contact him. It's a cheerful little six-note tune that is from Prokofiev's 'Peter and the Wolf' -- the start of the theme for the young boy Peter. What that means, I don't know. Maybe it's what Villeneuve uses for his phone and it's just a little inside joke??) Parts of this film are like Arrival, parts of it like 2001: A Space Odyssey, other parts like Interstellar (all good comparisons). But above all, it's most like its own predecessor, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. In that sense it's not the totally original vision that the first film was, but it's a worthy successor to a classic.I'm rating this 'just' 9 out of 10 because I thought the plot line was just a bit unclear at times -- why were the characters doing what they were doing and how did that fit in with what happened earlier? Moment by moment the action holds your attention but it was the longer arc that was a bit muddy. Maybe it will clear up with a second viewing. Still, that gives you lots to talk about later, which a good piece of art ought to.",9,1,6,11 October 2017
First Man," First Man is first rate
","There are two sequences that form the linchpins of this movie, and both happen in the second half. The first of these, predictably, is the Apollo 11 launch sequence that after years of preparation at last sent Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins on their way to the Moon. It's magnificent. The screen gives this sequence the full treatment it deserves, combining closeups from the gantry tower with horizon-to-horizon views of the vehicle climbing into the sky, all punctuated and emphasized by a majestic score from Justin Hurwitz (who also scored Whiplash and La La Land, though I didn't know him by name till now). And the Saturn V multistage rocket that was built for the Apollo lunar missions really was a monster (there's one on view nicely laid out end-to-end at the Cape Canaveral visitor center that is jaw-droppingly awesome. It takes a long, long time to walk from one end to the other.) It's only now, half a century later, that a new generation of launch vehicles of similar power are finally being built again.The second sequence, again predictably, is the descent to the Lunar surface, which is likely the closest this historic mission came to disaster. The last part of it is played out almost in real time and includes segments of the actual footage from the spider-like Apollo 11 lander, during which Armstrong took manual control to locate a workable landing site and touch down JUST before the fuel ran out. This is for real; the nominal site turned out to have too many large boulders for safety, which the astronauts could see once they got close, and yes indeed they were that close to running on fumes.First Man fits nicely alongside other first-rate movies about the real history of space flight including Apollo 13 (1995) and The Right Stuff (1983) -- and also the documentaries Mercury 13 (2018) and In The Shadow Of The Moon (2007). These all have a completely different feel to them than even the best and most realistic science-fiction movies about space (like Interstellar, Gravity, The Martian). You can't go wrong with a film about real history that shows what humans are really capable of.So why do I give this 'only' a rating of 8? Mostly some nagging stylistic concerns with Damien Chazelle's direction. First, Neil Armstrong's story jumps from his beginnings as an X-15 pilot and engineer, to his crucial stint in the Gemini program, and then on into Apollo, but they are shown through a series of vignette scenes rather than a continuous thread. I guess this is just me, but I'm happier with the linear, connected storytelling that Ron Howard used in Apollo 13. Second though, it's Chazelle's decision to use extreme closeups over and over again. Sometimes it works very well indeed, such as the Lunar landing sequence where Armstrong's eyes display a laser-like concentration and focus beyond what most people would even be capable of, let alone under that kind of pressure. It's a great bit of acting by Ryan Gosling and it's done with nothing more than the eyes. Speaking of which, Claire Foy (playing Jan Armstrong) has wonderful, wonderful eyes -- so this stylistic device suits her very well indeed. But a lot of the time this approach generates a sort of claustrophobic feel that would be relieved by an occasional outside wider-angle shot at least to put the scene in context. (And yes I know part of the point was to get across exactly that feel inside a tiny Gemini or Apollo capsule, but why always look BACK at their faces?)Gosling and Foy are excellent, and also I liked the supporting roles played by Kyle Chandler (as Deke Slayton) and Ciaran Hinds (as Bob Gilruth). The settings for 1950's and 1960's USA life and living are meticulously done. Kudos especially for the music score which is among the best I've heard in any movie; it does what the scene calls for, by turns graceful, rhythmic, powerful, or even just silent -- whatever's needed. The lunar landscape is shown in all its bleak, alien glory with a few scenes that do nothing more (or less) than pan across it silently. Most importantly, entirely without dialog we get the feeling of what it must have been like for someone, one human being, to be the first to set foot on an entirely different world that has been sitting entirely undisturbed for the last 4 billion years.All this aside though, the true theme of the film is obviously meant to be a character study of Neil Armstrong. It's well known that he was both an introvert and a very, very good astronaut who had built a record of something you could call extreme competence. He always had the right insight, said the right thing, made the right decisions under pressure -- all of which came into play during Apollo 11. But after the Apollo program was over he avoided publicity and moved to a quiet life as a professor of aerospace engineering at U.Cincinnati and remained something of an enigma right to his death in 2012. Did he actually leave on the moon that tiny bracelet of his daughter who died tragically at age 2? No one yet knows but it was a reasonable guess on the writers' part, and it rather effectively ties together an essential part of his story arc. I don't know how realistically the relationship between Neil and Jan is portrayed, but I suspect that some of it is a bit speculative.But go and see it for those two central sequences. They alone are worth the price of admission.",8,1,5,14 October 2018
Wind River," Flawless execution
","Giving this film a numerical rating seems almost beside the point (though I've done it anyway), because it's so close to reality. The disclaimer 'based on actual events' is familiar enough for movies these days but in this case the underlying themes ring very, very true beyond just the facts of the story line. In this case my rating reflects just how well it delivers its material, which is austere, beautifully paced, and absorbing.It's simple enough in outline -- FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olson) has been sent to a Wyoming Native American reservation to investigate the murder of 18-year-old Natalie (whom we see in flashbacks). Soon, the body of her boyfriend is uncovered too and the case becomes a double murder. Banner joins with local wildlife officer Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) to pursue the evidence. Familiar and excellent Native American actors like Graham Greene, Gil Birmingham, and Tantoo Cardinal have a strong presence throughout. But the real, uncredited star of this film is the mountain and prairie landscape. It's built from the powerfully simple elements of 'snow and silence' -- the only things, as Lambert says to another character toward the end, that we haven't taken away from the native people. In every scene, it's just quietly THERE as the backdrop, and sometimes completely determines what the characters can even do. My wife and I went into the theater to see it on a bright, sunny summer afternoon, but when we came out 2 hours later, the feel of the landscape had seeped in so inexorably that we instinctively expected that it ought to be cold and snowy outside!The actors are all great across the board. No false notes. Olson plays the agent who's been thrown into an unfamiliar environment but is able to learn quickly, lead, yet has the sense to take all the help and advice available. For me though the real centerpiece was Renner's character, a man of subtleties that are uncovered bit by bit. We learn that his own teenage daughter was killed some time ago (and therefore he's the only one who can truly talk to Birmingham's character Martin, the murdered girl's father). He's already been through the abyss and come out the other side. In a sense he's the reverse of the stereotypical tough-guy-with-a-soft-center. He's laconic, matter-of-fact, a loyal father to his remaining child (a young son) and as an expert tracker, hunter, and shooter he has credibility with the locals both on and off the reservation. He's a sympathetic, intrinsically good man. But we gradually see that he's built a rock-hard core into his soul that does not forgive willfully bad choices (such as by the son of his friend Martin) and most of all he doesn't forgive evil. Eventually (SPOILER!) he treats the handful of violent, dull, selfish young men who are finally uncovered as the murderers the same way he would a mountain lion attacking cattle -- and with no greater effect on his conscience. But it's not Terminator-style cartoon vengeance at all. It's quietly done and all the more effective for its realism. The final events pack a real wallop.Afterwards I thought a bit about how this movie would have worked if filmed in Canada. Most of it would carry over with no serious change: same kind of landscape (probably southwestern Alberta would work instead of Wyoming), the same backstory of native peoples held down in depressed surroundings and lack of opportunity, and the same horrible history of their missing and murdered girls. The one thing that would have played out differently was the shocking firefight with handguns near the end: no guns, so no firefight.The only reason I don't give this 10/10 is that it's hard to make out some of the dialog. Many of the actors don't enunciate clearly. Why is mumbling such a common 'style' now?",9,2,5,7 September 2017
The Death of Stalin," Expertly done, wickedly funny black comedy
","I see that some other reviewers really don't like the idea of pulling black humor out of a real historical event -- in this case, the jockeying for power in the inner circle of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union immediately after the death of one of the most brutal dictators in history. Fair enough, it's a personal response. Most entries into the black-comedy move genre are just completely fictional, so it's an extra step into riskier territory to base it on real events. I can imagine certain setups that I might offensive if they were used as the basis of dark humor (Hitler, or Jesus? but there are examples out there of those too, like Inglourious Basterds). However, Death of Stalin didn't bother me at all, and I'm (almost) old enough to have lived through the actual period. Pulling wry humor out of intrinsically bleak situations is, frankly, yet another human ability.The entire success or failure of such films is in how well they're done. In comedy, timing of dialog and plot details is key, and the timing in this expert production is right on the mark. The ensemble cast delivers: the centerpiece is the competition between Beria (Simon Russell Beale, playing him as a power-hungry control obsessive who ultimately loses to his own overconfidence) and Krushchev (Steve Buscemi, playing yet another version of Steve Buscemi) but the work turned in by the other leads is first rate: Jeffrey Tambor as Malenkov, a somewhat spineless figure who nevertheless wants to be a Big Player; Michael Palin as Molotov, speaking inscrutable dialog that refuses to uncover his real beliefs (if indeed he has any); Andrea Riseborough as daughter Svetlana Stalin, forceful and peripatetic yet oddly powerless, along with Rupert Friend as her wacko brother Vasily; Adrian McLoughlin as Stalin himself, a sort of low-class careless thug; and Jason Isaacs as Zhukov, the no-nonsense field marshal who holds real military power is cheerfully unafraid of any of these crass politicians. A big key is that all their personality types are radically different from one another, so the main driver for the plot is to see how all of them bounce off each other. All were real historical figures and no one is safe from the satirical takes in this production. Adding to the ambience are the sets and settings, which accurately get across the time and place.And yes, it is both black and funny. In one little scene Beria and a colleague are walking along a corridor talking while behind them a body bag rolls down a stairwell, unnoticed. In another, a firing squad interrupts its work halfway through as 'new orders' arrive to spare the political prisoners. The first man NOT to get shot looks down perplexedly at the previous one in line dead on the ground, then over to his equally stunned fellows. Lots more like this.There wasn't a dull moment from beginning to end. Go see it, you'll have fun and even learn a lot about the actual era.",8,1,2,8 April 2018
Darkest Hour," 'He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.'
","Western civilization still owes an incalculable debt to Winston Churchill, one of the towering figures of the 20th century and the one who more than any other single person was responsible for mobilizing the Allies to confront Hitler at an utterly critical stage of World War II. This movie focusses in on the crucial first two months of Churchill's stint as Prime Minister, May/June 1940 during which the Nazis were overrunning France, having already swept through Belgium, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. It looked like Britain would be next, which would effectively leave Europe as a Nazi empire. What then?In other words, the stakes in this story are very high. Its dramatic arc is not the actual wartime action (though there are scenes of the attack on the garrison at Calais, and arranging for the evacuation of soldiers from Dunkirk is mentioned frequently). There are already countless movies WWII movies for that -- name your favorite battle or campaign and there's a film about it. This one shows the political and personal drama going on behind the scenes, leading up to how Churchill changed the course of his country's entire approach to the war.The 'villain' of the movie is not Hitler (who remains offstage) but rather Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary who is seen to relentlessly push for peace negotiations using (of all people) Mussolini as a broker. Halifax and Chamberlain have a number of scenes in which they are essentially plotting to make Churchill step down so that they can once again take over. Their basic argument seems to be that this will be the only way to minimize casualties for their own citizens; who cares about the other countries. I don't know how realistic this part of the script is, but it seems like dramatic exaggeration is going on. My guess is that the role of Halifax stands in for the whole negotiation/appeasement approach that did still have some support in general, despite plenty of evidence that it had already failed (see Chamberlain and the infamous 'Peace in Our Time' speech).As Churchill, this is lead actor Gary Oldman's film; in every scene either he's the dominant figure, or he's the subject of conversation by others. There's no doubt Oldman goes all out for this, absorbing himself into the character as he usually does. In the first half he plays Churchill as somewhat indecisive, uncertain just what to do next, and again I don't know just how realistic this is. Churchill was known to have suffered from intermittent depression for most of his life, but it didn't seem to affect his public persona or decision making. At a turning point in the plot, it looks like he will finally buckle under the relentless pressure from Halifax and his crowd. But then two events turn him around and finally solidify the instincts he has had all along: the first is a direct visit from the King (George VI, played very nicely by Ben Mendelsohn), who tells him that the one person who is the most dismayed by Churchill's taking the PM position is Hitler himself. The second is an entirely fictional (but cinematically pure gold) meeting with a bunch of average citizens riding to work on the Underground, who tell him emphatically that they will never give in to any Nazis. The big payoff is his electrifying speech to Parliament 'We shall fight on the beaches ... we shall never surrender'. It's a great scene particularly because this is, in a way, the actual time and place that Hitler's defeat was assured.Everybody else's part in the movie is a supporting one, but I liked the roles played by Lily James (as Churchill's secretary), the underused Kristin Scott Thomas (as Clementine Churchill), and Stephen Dillane in the thankless role of Halifax. Good work all. But coming back to Gary Oldman himself -- obviously no effort was spared in making him up for the part with clothing, prosthetics, cigars (!), body posture and gait and everything else, but he still didn't look convincingly like the real thing. There's something fundamentally different about Churchill's facial structure that all the makeup can't cover for. But in addition to that, the real Churchill's voice had a type of resonance that Oldman can't quite put across. Oldman is no doubt going to get an Oscar nomination, and it's well deserved, but I actually thought he was robbed of the award for his even better work in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011). The character of spymaster George Smiley fits him a lot better.The overall message of this film is a legitimately big one. It's not explicitly said, but it runs unspoken through the whole thing: Individual people matter at the level of world politics as much as they do anywhere else. Individual leaders can plunge their people into the abyss, or they can inspire them forward to amazing accomplishments. It's not any kind of exaggeration to say that Churchill and his powerful oratory turned the tide of World War II. Without him, we would be living in a very different world today.See this one in combination with 'Dunkirk' (also 2017), and the lovely little gem 'Their Finest' (2016). They'd make a great little mini-festival centered on the same era of WWII.",8,0,3,31 December 2017
Captain Marvel," Yes! The Marvel universe has a Superwoman!! plus: thoughts on Troll-Free Ratings (TFRs)..
","I've seen this movie twice now. The first time through it felt a little disjointed, but I'm happy to say that the second time through the various pieces fell together better. The whole storyline is essentially one uninterrupted sequence beginning with Carol on the Kree home planet Hala, through the guerilla mission against the Skrulls, and on to Earth where she meets Nick Fury and pieces out her true identity. There are really no side plots. My thoughts overall:<ul><li>First and most basic, this is a new Marvel Studios movie to have fun with. It's another chance to sit back and absorb yourself in a gratifying fantasy world with superheros doing their thing. What's not to like? The usual great production values, and a stacked cast including Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law, Annette Bening, Ben Mendelsohn, Gemma Chan -- and of course the scene-stealing cat Goose (whose character poster has just been voted the fan favorite).</li></ul><ul><li>Before I forget to mention this: the end credits are beautifully done. They have the same style and feel as the credits from Wonder Woman (2017), which were also beautiful. Kudos!</li></ul><ul><li>I'm pretty sure most of us in the theater were waiting for the second half where Carol finally goes full Binary mode (as briefly shown in the second trailer) and sure enough this carries a great Wow! factor. We haven't seen this kind of mid-air (or mid-space) heavyweight fight sequence since Man of Steel, which qualifies her for the MCU's Superwoman. I'm *never* going to get tired of watching that section and have my fingers crossed that we'll get more in Avengers Endgame. Also, I was wondering how they were going to do the costume transition from the rather cold green/blue tones of the Kree into the warmer, much more appealing classic red/blue design. The way it's done is really clever.</li></ul><ul><li>But I'll probably just have to get used to Brie Larson's fairly light-textured voice. Like some others who've commented on this, I would have preferred it to have more weight (compare the voices of Bening or Chan in this movie). But my daughter assures me that it's all OK. if it's fine with younger viewers in the audience (particularly girls) who are seeing themselves represented on screen, then I won't complain.</li></ul><ul><li>On the other hand, the most important bit of dialog in the movie comes very near the end where Carol pronounces 'I have nothing to prove to you' to one of the key characters in a way that takes the classic stereotypical 'final confrontation of hero with villain' scene and stands it on its head. Right on!! There are a number of feminist-flavor statements or setups throughout the film, but that one scene is where it really does hit home.</li></ul><ul><li>From the trailers I think a lot of us figured that this 'origin story' was going to depart significantly from the comic-book origins of CM (which the MCU has done with a number of other important characters). But ... yes and no. First, half the scenes in the trailers never appeared in the movie. But second, the story ended up hewing surprisingly close to the line in the CM comics, with just a couple of character switches. It's ingeniously done. There is just one MAJOR change from the comics storyline vis-a-vis the Kree and Skrulls, which I won't give away, and which works well enough and also retroactively ties in with certain plot elements of the the Agents of Shield TV series.</li></ul><ul><li>The well publicized motion-capture and de-aging of Fury and Coulson is pretty good, but the technique is still not seamless (Coulson particularly looked somewhat artificial). It would just make more sense to me, if something is set well in the past, not to spend a lot of screen time on familiar characters de-aged.</li></ul>Bottom line for me is that this is a good movie, without being the MCU's best. It does however fill a necessary step in the extended Avengers/Thanos/etc. storyline that has been building up for so long. Yes CM does push social boundaries, but not as much as Black Panther did. What I mean is that for BP, virtually the entire cast were black. To be equally radical for women, the MCU needs to make a movie where almost all the superheros are female ... and to point out the obvious, they've already made a bunch where they're almost all male, so why not? Let's have it, Marvel!OK: now for the trolls, who sadly but predictably jumped on the ratings for CM just like they said in their ludicrous flame-wars before its release. I REALLY wish the rest of us didn't have to waste our time with these hypersensitive misogynists whose only aim is to destroy. However, what's new about their pathetically nasty reactions to CM is that finally these have become outrageous enough that they have provoked collective counterattacks at the institutional level, not just from individuals. The Rotten Tomatoes site has taken steps to purge them, and the entire Disney corporation has actually stepped in with its own response. Not that I'm automatically in favor of what Disney does (e.g. their gutless firing of director James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy), but in this case I think they are doing the right thing. Society has to work out a better way to prevent the damages that trolling, hate speech, and misogyny can wreak. And a necessary step is just what's happening now -- to expose them for what they are in the cold light of day.However, in the meantime we need to have some tools to get Troll-Free Ratings (TFRs) for the movies we care about. Fortunately, IMdB provides the material to do that, because unlike other sites it actually supplies full breakdowns of the viewer voting. Here's how to use the IMdB scores easily and conveniently to get a TFR:<ul><li>First look at the bar graph of the voters' ratings (which you get by clicking on the number of voters just below the mean score). For CM you'll see a pile of votes in the 1/10 bin. Those are the trolls. Eliminate that bin from the average, and you'll get a much more accurate score. Even quicker, look at the 'median' rating which does better than the average at de-weighting extremely low or high votes. (Just for fun, look at how CM rates with 'females under 18' versus 'males over 45'.)</li></ul><ul><li>Better yet, just look at the shape of the bar graph and it's obvious where the true center is. For CM, it's about 7.5, and I think that's fairly much on the mark. This center is technically called the mode of the distribution, and there is a useful statistical rule of thumb to calculate it, which is this: mode = 3 (median) - 2 (mean). For example, at the time when I'm writing this, CM has 86,475 votes with a mean of 6.8 (heavily dragged down by more than 11,000 trolls) and a median of 7. The mode is then 7.4. The 'mode' is a terrific way to get the TFR.</li></ul><ul><li>BUT: (and this is important): the great majority of IMdB voters are male, whereas the moviegoing public is pretty much half-and-half male and female. So a still better thing to do, after you've cut out the trolls, is to take the men's rating and average it *equally* with the women's rating. Thanks to IMdb showing these details broken down by age and gender, you can do that. Women do rate CM higher, but once you eliminate the troll votes it's actually not much higher. than the men.</li></ul><ul><li>As a final thought, you'll see a pileup of votes in the 10/10 bin too. So are these people 'anti-trolls'? Not necessarily. I would argue that a 10/10 vote here is a lot more likely to be sincere and representative of the movie's impact on that viewer than a 1/10 vote is. The aim of an absurdly low vote is to destroy, whereas the aim of an only-slightly-high vote is to promote. Here I'll side with the promoters.</li></ul>",8,13,26,8 March 2019
Passengers," This is a deeper film than most people realized -- it's more than just a glossy sci-fi ride.
","The interstellar starship is one of the major science-fiction tropes. If, as 'Passengers' does, you decide to go with the laws of physics and accept sub-light-speed, then it means taking decades or centuries to go between stars. So then, either you put your crew and passengers into hibernation and completely automate the ship; or else build a ship that people can live in for generations -- so that most of the passengers will live out their whole lives on it and never see the final destination. 'Passengers' effectively invites us to see what both possibilities would be like.In either case the ship has to be BIG, and the one designed for this film is a beauty. It gets lots of screen time too, and for me it was almost the star of the show. (It's fun comparing it with the nicely done interPLANETARY ships for other space movies like 'The Martian', '2010', or the iconic '2001' -- interstellar is a whole different category of complexity.) In general, the sets for both interiors and exterior are well worked out.(Caution: some spoilers ahead. My comments will make more sense if you've already seen the film.)By contrast with the ship, the storyline and the cast of characters are pared down to an absolute minimum while it confronts us with some challenging moral issues. Some years into the voyage to a new colony, Something Goes Wrong -- the ship passes through a cloud of meteroids that partially damage the ship's systems. (Science detour here -- deep interstellar space isn't like an asteroid belt and it shouldn't have much more than sparse gas and dust, not big hunks of rock. They might have found another plot device to get the same result.) A single random passenger, mechanic Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is accidentally woken from hibernation. The voyage still has 88 years to go. The crew, who might be able to fix tings, are also in hibernation and inaccessible within a sealed area, so he's facing the rest of his life being completely alone (not counting the robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen), who's not exactly a substitute for human companionship). More than a year goes by. After agonizing with himself for a very long time, he awakens Aurora Lane, a journalist (Jennifer Lawrence), who then goes through her own cycle of denial/rage/bargaining/acceptance, and of course eventually finds out what he did. Their relationship, which up to that point was starting to go well, predictably breaks down. This is where things might stick, except that the ship's systems are getting gradually worse and clearly something needs to be done. Jumping to the end, the obligatory final action scenes lead them to the ship being restored (with some crucial and unexpected help) and bring the plot to a satisfying, though not completely expected, finish.Jim's decision to awaken Aurora, which is the critical point of the plot, sparked some real controversy around this film. Is his action morally equivalent to murder? Not really. Or rape? Not exactly. Maybe something like abduction??? Yes, it was a personal violation that prevents Aurora from having the life she planned for. Is Jim's decision inexcusable, as many viewers felt? Is it inexcusable but yet understandable? Probably most people would agree that he'd have been justified in awakening some of the crew, because the lives of all the thousands of people on board are in jeopardy. But that's what he (correctly) tried first and was unable to do. What would the audience reaction have been if the tables were turned such that she awoke first and then brought him out? Are the situations equivalent? I think the film is inviting us to visualize ourselves in their places: Jim knows this step is somehow wrong, but otherwise he's facing decades of utter loneliness, maybe madness, or suicide. What would we do? It's an extraordinary situation that no one in today's world has actually had to deal with. There are echos here of the archetypal Adam and Eve story, but there's no God and no Satan, just impersonal forces represented by the ship and the universe outside.However, I think that a discussion over the morality of all this must also include the ending. Almost beyond hope the chance comes to at least partially recover. With the ship back to full functionality, they find that it will be possible to use the auto-doc to restart hibernation -- but for just one of them, because the other one has to set it running. Jim offers to do it for Aurora, and now she has a free choice: shall she opt to get her original life plan back again, or to stay with him? So in a nice bit of symmetry, each of them has to confront a moral decision for which there is no completely convincing answer.The ultimate message, if there is one, seems to be that if you don't get the life you planned, then live the life you get. That's not too bad.What helps is that the actors do a good job of selling it. Chris Pratt is versatile and likable, and the equally versatile Jennifer Lawrence is excellent; she's got a rare screen presence. She is also not simply playing a 'victim' -- in other words, she has agency of her own. The supporting players (all two of them!) do fine as well, but it's the central pair that counts above all -- and, of course, the ship itself.",7,1,1,1 January 2019
Knives Out," See this for the amazing cast, especially Christopher Plummer
","First off, the cast --- wow. Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Ana de Armas, Katherine Langford, and that absolute treasure of screen and stage Christopher Plummer. In a single movie of normal run time it's impossible to give all these accomplished actors enough individual screen time, but every one of them plays their part to virtual perfection as various members of a dysfunctional (but rich) family under the thumb of patriach Harlan Thrombey (Plummer). His apparent murder sets off a chain of infighting and personal back-and-forth among his children, grandchildren, and their spouses that has the feel of just one more round of backbiting that they have carried on their whole lives.Everybody is excellent, but even in this cast Plummer stands out even though most of his appearances (as flashbacks) are restricted to the first half. He can dominate a scene just by being in it, and his delivery of lines is so effortless and commanding at a level that none of the others can quite reach. He's now age 90, so personally I'm saddened that we're likely not to see too much more of him. Enjoy.The two major parts are de Armas, Harlan's live-in nurse (and the only genuinely likeable person in the cast, so we have no trouble rooting for her), and Craig, as the detective aiming to solve the case. A lot of the superficial look-and-feel of the story is supposed to resemble an Agatha Christie mystery, obviously, and the script has a meta touch in that old Thrombey has made his fortune as a mystery writer. But it very quickly veers off into eccentric directions that make this whole thing quite distinctive. There are loads of details that make for a constant thread of understated humor: e.g. the detective is 'Benoit Blanc', an obvious callback to Hercule Poirot, but he has a thick southern-US accent that verges on parody. No one quite knows why he's there in the first place, he seems to be rather a bumbling fool, but this is something of a disguise too ... no spoilers! All the action takes place in a classic crumbling mansion complete with secret passages, side stairs, escape ladders -- and there's a sunroom with a throne-like chair surrounded by knives that resembles the Game of Thrones throne, and even has a key part to play at the end. And of course there's creepy Great-Nana Wanetta (K Callan) who sits by a stairway window all day (and maybe night, we can never tell) and says nothing ('How old is she??' 'Nobody really knows.') Without giving anything away I'll just say that things wind up pretty much the way they rightfully should.Knives Out is thoroughly fun and a great addition to the mystery movie genre.",8,1,2,18 December 2019
Aquaman," 'Worlds of DC' has discovered color!
","Aquaman has loads of spectacle and loads of color -- all the way down to Mera's ultra-red hair. In that one way it's the polar opposite of the dark and glum Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad. Director James Wan has decided to throw the kitchen sink at us, with giant armored sharks, supergiant weaponized crabs, fleets of manta rays, armies of mermen, magic tridents, and even wilder fantasy flights of imagination. What makes this work, which it pretty much does, is that it has the big advantage of being new: we haven't seen this before, by comparison with any other action-driven movies that are usually on the 'surface world', as the Atlanteans refer to it.But as writer Ursula LeGuin once said, if the only thing happening is unrelenting physical action then it's a sure sign that there is no story being told. And that's where Aquaman teeters on the edge. It's got a storyline, which is actually quite simple and barely adequate to support all the action, but in a sense the real center of interest is the spectacle itself largely because of its new and unfamiliar setting. The overall feeling I got was that I was watching some kind of stylistic combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Pacific Rim, Star Wars, and King Arthur all piled together. My (adult) daughter says it's like a cross between Tron and Little Mermaid.About the acting: Jason Momoa is -- OK. Maybe a promise for better things to come. He and all the rest suffer from having to deliver a pretty simplistic script with stereotype dialog. I was generally pleased with Amber Heard as Mera; she got more to do than I was expecting and they gave her a distinctive water-control superpower that was fun to see and came in handy at certain points. Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe stood clearly above all the rest, however, just for their quality of diction; i.e. they didn't mumble. Why has slurring your words become a 'style'?? As a last comment, I thought Rupert Gregson-Williams' musical score was kind of a disappointment. It was workmanlike and did the job needed for an epic like this (essentially telling us how to feel at every moment) but it was nowhere near the standout work he did for Wonder Woman.Bottom line is that you'll get your money's worth for an evening's entertainment. For Worlds of DC it's a step up in production values. Now let's just add some serious storytelling to go with it.",7,1,6,21 December 2018
Deadpool 2," All that you expected, and more besides
","Deadpool (2016) carved out a new sub-genre in superhero movies: satirical, post-modern, subversive, self-referential, and (incidentally) R-rated for over-the-top violence. And of course, style and flair to burn or else it wouldn't have worked. And of course neither Deadpool 1 or 2 would work without being able to build on a legacy of 'mainstream' superhero films; they would just be too bizarre to stand on their own. Both Deadpools are easier to follow if you already know a fair bit about the X-Men universe that they draw from. But even so the script plays fast and loose with a number of the characters including Cable, Yukio, Juggernaut, and Deadpool himself, none of whom exactly resemble their comic book sources or backstory. Nevertheless this feels like the role that Ryan Reynolds has been looking for his whole career -- a likable and talented guy who just hadn't had much luck before this.The plot, such as it is, walks quite a tightrope between an actual serious storyline on one hand, and hyperviolent/satirical/absurdist comedy on the other, simultaneously taking itself seriously and just the opposite. Somehow this works, thanks to the smart, snappy dialog and constantly motoring action so that you never get a chance to stop and think -- you're just reacting to the next clever gag, setup, or action scene. Great thing about the human brain is that it can keep at least two contradictory viewpoints going at the same time, and this movie takes full advantage of that. One reviewer remarked that it's like Deadpool (the hero) exists both inside and outside the film at the same time.Compared with the first Deadpool, this one takes everything further. The violence is so over-the-top that it's cartoonishly absurd -- think Quentin Tarantino but more so, and without the slow buildups. Wonderfully stylish: as an example, spectacular collisions happens, bodies fly in slo-mo, and all to the strains of an Enya song. It works. The first Deadpool routinely 'broke the fourth wall'; this one somehow manages to break the third, second, and first walls at times -- not sure how to put it but that's what it felt like. And about the mid-credits scene sequence, which in some sense the whole movie acted as a setup for -- it's incredible and beyond absurd. How to describe it? surreal? solipsistic? words fail me but absolutely don't leave the theater before you see it.Minor quibbles: too much use of Colossus and not enough of the perversely charming Teenage Warhead. They overused Deadpool's impossible-to-kill powers -- it was used only as necessary in #1 but here it kind of becomes a running joke. He's blown to bits (literally!), riddled with bullets, snapped in half, torn in half, and a bunch of other things almost as gruesome. And Cable wasn't developed enough despite a lot of screen time. But I really enjoyed Zazie Beetz as Domino, who clearly demonstrates that luck is indeed a superpower, but hand-to-hand combat expertise also gives it a boost.I wonder what the inevitable Deadpool 3 will be like. Where can they go from here?",7,0,1,22 May 2018
X-Men," This is where the superhero movie genre began
","Contrary to the ongoing publicity from the MCU, the superhero-film genre did NOT start with Iron Man (2008). It began 8 years earlier with X-Men and director Bryan Singer's deft vision of how to take realistic people who just happen to have mutant powers, and convincingly put them on screen. My rating for IMdB really means a 7 'with an asterisk'. Several years ago I would probably have given X-Men a higher numerical rating for IMdB, but of course the field has kept rising in the nearly two decades (!) since.. But that's really the whole point: this ground-breaking movie itself deserves a ton of credit for getting that train rolling. With apologies to the classic Superman and Batman films of the previous generation (ca. 1980-90), they really had no successors, and the special effects capabilities were not really up to the task. X-Men is what made this genre stick. I watched it again recently on DVD after many years' absence, and it still holds up quite well. It's just so likable. The characters are engaging like people you'd want to know better, the storyline is clear, and the ending is satisfying while obviously leaving threads for a followup. Its eagerly welcomed sequel X2: X-Men United (2003) raised the bar in every way and it still ranks IMHO among the handful of the best superhero films ever made.X-Men gets a lot of things right. For one thing, the X-Men comics from which it draws its basic elements has had a very strong cohort of female characters almost right from the beginning. Sure enough, in this movie the cast of players has something approaching gender equity with Jean Grey, Ororo, Rogue, and Mystique (Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn) alongside the leading men (Professor X, Magneto, Scott Summers, and of course Wolverine -- Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James Marsden, Hugh Jackman). The only thing that doesn't *quite* make it to full gender equality is that the agendas driving the plot are still being set by the two older men who lead the opposing teams of good and bad mutants. Another obvious highlight is the quality of the casting. Stewart and McKellen, already well established top actors at that stage, gave the cast instant credibility are almost perfectly suited for their roles. Hugh Jackman was a revelation in his breakout role as Wolverine: the snarling, physically intimidating antihero continually plagued by the mystery of his own origin. Halle Berry, who I guess was intended to lend another reasonably big name to the list, looked the part of Storm all right but was too soft-spoken: that character needs to have a commanding, regal demeanor. James Marsden is fine as action team leader Scott Summers, though a dozen other guys would do as well. The young Anna Paquin plays a mutant who hates and is trapped by her own power. Famke Janssen, though not a great actress, nevertheless nicely puts across a charismatic warmth. In a key too-short scene halfway through, we get an early foreshadowing of her capability for self-aware self-sacrifice: the mind-enhancing Cerebro computer (straight from the comics!) has been sabotaged and puts the Professor into a coma after he tries to use it. Jean, knowingly putting her entire mind at risk, uses it to uncover Magneto's location. In X2 -- where she's really the central character -- she will choose a much costlier action to save the entire team. For the villains (here called the Brotherhood -- the 'Brotherhood of Evil Mutants' as it was in the early rather simplistic X-Men comics, just wouldn't have worked -- Tyler Mane and Ray Park as Sabretooth and Toad don't have much to do before the final dust-up, but they're fine. The shapeshifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) doesn't need to do much either except look spectacular, which indeed she does, but in the final action scenes she has a great all-out fight with Wolverine. Storm also gets to show off her full weather-controlling power at several points throughout. The first 20 minutes or so has the difficult job of introducing not just one new leading character but an entire team of them. To get this across, we get a very nicely staged series of dramatic entries. First is the flashback to the concentration camp in 1944 where young Erik (now Magneto) has the traumatic experience that shapes his entire life. Then it's the present day with Jean speaking at a Senate committee meeting that also introduces Senator Kelly (an effective Bruce Davison) and the 'mutant problem' that underlies all the X-Men movies, along with Charles and Erik behind the scenes . Then in rapid succession we get Rogue, Logan, Scott, and Storm expertly linked, and finally the X-mansion where the main plot can finally get started. A nice touch is that all the action is placed in historical context: the shadowy contest between Professor X and Magneto and their teams has already been going on for years, and this plot is just one episode in a bigger story. X2 continues the saga pretty much where this important first one leaves off. Finally, I'll repeat what I said in my review of X2: they both succeed because the storyline and the characters take center stage -- not the action scenes. X-Men doesn't skimp on action, but it's what happens *between* the action set pieces that makes a movie like this last.",7,1,1,15 April 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Great on its own, but also a crafty prelude to Avengers 3 and 4
","Clever guys, these Marvel Cinematic Universe planners -- Kevin Fiege and the rest. Like it or not I have to give them credit for thinking way down the path, which they have the confidence to do now that they've established a mega-successful franchise. Every MCU movie is linked not just to the next one but to the entire set. Now that I've seen Avengers Infinity War, a reasonable way to look at Thor Ragnarok is as a prelude to that and to Avengers 4 coming next year. I liked Thor Ragnarok quite a lot -- it covers an amazing amount of ground in its 2:10 run time, has a great cast list with impressively excellent actors (Anthony Hopkins, Cate Blanchett, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Benedict Cumberbatch -- wow.) And Chris Hemsworth really owns this role as Thor now: he can be serious, relaxed, funny, whatever the scene calls for and he puts it across comfortably. And of course the visuals, sets, production values are all as expertly crafted as Marvel has ever done up to this point. In short, it's great to look at and easy to settle into for a fun ride. We start with a great segment between Thor, Loki, and Dr. Strange, move from there to reconnect with Odin and introduce Hela, then (zip!) on to the Grandmaster's planet and join up with the Hulk, then finally the return to Asgard. With all these disparate pieces and drastic changes of tone the whole thing could easily have fallen apart, but director Taiki Waititi pulls it off with energy and humor. Kudos to him. Also, kudos for his great voice acting as Korg, the rock creature on Planet Hulk. He's utterly charming and actually does steal all his scenes.But I still rank the first Thor (2011) as one of the half-dozen best superhero movies ever. Thanks to director Kenneth Branagh it beautifully straddled the mythological Asgardian world with 'everyday Earth' and made it work. Most crucially of all, it gave us a classic, meaningful storyline with emotional resonance: it didn't skimp on action but the action itself was not the heart of the film. Thor: The Dark World (2013) gave us more of the same Asgard-centered setting and action, it wasn't bad at all, but just not put across with the same conviction, and it kind of led to a dead end for the characters.But now Ragnarok: yes it's great but there were nevertheless things about it that bothered me -- for example, in Thor I and II, Asgard is clearly just one of the Nine Realms, in line with Norse mythology. It's essentially in a different dimension than Earth (= Midgard) and to travel between them you had to go via the magical Bifrost. But now MCU seems to have decided that Asgard is just another place in space that you can travel to or from via regular old spaceship -- as we see at the end of the film. This is a BIG change of direction -- it brings the Asgardian 'gods' down to the normal superhero level like Iron Man and Falcon and all the rest. And the Asgardians themselves, who looked terrifically noble and impressive in Thor I and II, here look like just what they are, which is a bunch of casting extras off the street. I'd rather have Thor still be special and I'd rather have Asgard be Asgard.And his hammer -- broken up by Evil Sister Hela almost at the beginning of the story. ??? This is an equally dramatic step away from Thor's Norse mythological roots. In fact there are lots of versions of Thor in the stories, including a period in the Marvel comics where Thor was even a woman, Jane Foster -- but there is NO version of Thor without the hammer. I came out of the theater thinking 'Hey, bring that back! No fair!' Yes, I know -- the dramatic purpose was to make Thor realize that his trademark self-confidence needs to rest within himself and not Mjolnir.This film is also the first serious indication that as the MCU develops, they are willing to start playing real hardball. Trashing the hammer, putting out one of Thor's eyes (ow! gee thanks, Sis), and even Ragnarok itself where all of Asgard is brought down, are messages that they are not just going to continue their movies with the same-old types of stories. As we know by now, Infinity War goes one step further. But I also draw some hope from AIW, because Thor gets an eye back and also the newer and better hammer, Stormbreaker. It was a setup all along. So the MCU writers might seem bloody-minded but they still need to make it all good in the end -- now it's just taking a series of films to do it, not just one standalone story at a time.",8,1,1,10 May 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," SpiderMan movies will continue till morale improves
","So, SM:H comes across with a breezy tone, snappy dialog and pacing, bright colors, and the normal technical expertise we expect from the Marvel Universe. If this were the first-ever Spider-Man movie, it would be pretty great.But it's not. It's the sixth Spidey outing (or 7th if you count CA Civil War). And by this time frankly I've had more than enough of Peter's high school angst, webslinging, and predictable acrobatics without any accompanying depth to keep us more than superficially entertained. We've just seen it all before. Not that there aren't some good things about the production: Tom Holland (age 21) does about as well as you could expect putting across the persona of a puppy-eager, hero-worshipping, earnest but awkward 15-year-old. Michael Keaton is impressive as the in-your-face villain who can genuinely frighten. And Marisa Tomei gives us an Aunt Mae who's quite engagingly different from the previous versions by Sally Field and Rosemary Harris (which were also good).But then we get a big dose of Tony Stark ... for me, this was a BIG mistake. Connecting Spidey up to the Avengers universe so closely is a strategic blunder. In reality (i.e. the actual comics) Spiderman always stood alone, had his own adventures, made his own mistakes, and followed his own learning curve complete with Gwen Stacey and Mary Jane Watson and all the rest. Now, Marvel has essentially turned him into Iron Man Lite with a suit that's just a junior version of the grown-up edition. Tony Stark runs the MCU and we're supposed to expect that everyone else will fall in line? (Does that sound politically familiar?) But the worst thing is that if you look under the hood, there's not much there. It's all surface, and a lot of the time I found myself strangely just bored. Going to the theater to see SM:H pretty soon after seeing Wonder Woman was the biggest possible contrast you could imagine. In WW, the stakes were high, we could build emotional connections with the characters, and somehow things felt like they MATTERED. Some of the scenes moved people to tears -- did I see anyone reacting that way to SM:H? Not a chance. In this summer's sweepstakes, WW wins. It actually changed my standards for what superhero movies can be, whereas this Spider-Man is just a placeholder in the MCU.",6,2,27,3 August 2017
Suicide Squad," 'The Dirty Dozen' meets 'The Mummy' ...
","...but without the verve or charm that either of those two older movies had. The settings and staging are dark to the point of obsession, and I don't just mean the overall tone of the plot and script. The whole look of it is dark, dirty, and grimy, as if exposing any given scene to sunlight would reveal it for the ridiculousness that it is. A low-life bunch of criminals is conscripted to take down a mystic villain and her long-dead and now resurrected consort. Attempts to make this believable are hard going right from the start and never becoming convincing.What's probably worse though is the derivative nature of what's going on. There's actually nothing original here; any scene is something we've seen before in a different context. Same for the script, which is filled with trite dialog on all sides. The acting? The thing about a bad script and bad premise like this is that it tends to flatten everything, drag all the actors down with it to the same uniform low level even if they're capable people to begin with. There is actually almost no one here among the characters who you feel like rooting for or identifying with. Probably the only cast members who escape with their dignity intact are Will Smith (whose inimitable style seems to be able to carry him through anything) and Viola Davis (whose harder-than-nails Amanda Waller actually borders on believable -- though even she looks like she's rather be somewhere else). I know Margot Robbie is getting credit for standing out among this low bunch, but to me she looked trapped, as if 'how did I get involved in this mess?'was coming out through her eyes whenever she said or did something. Give her credit for trying. As for all the rest, they behave like escapees from the Monty Python School for Overacting. Adam Beach is probably glad that his character got killed off early.What remains is the special effects and CGI. Not bad, but ugliness overtakes them too. The Enchantress (Cara Delavigne) villain does leave a strong impression in both her guises, as some sort of tribal priestess and then as a powerful ancient-god kind of creature, but otherwise the highlights are few.Hard to believe they're intending to make a SS 2 (news as of mid-2018) rather than working on the more promising paths of the DCEU that are starting to open up. This however is probably more a statement about the standards of the studio and Hollywood in general than about anything related to quality.",4,0,0,5 August 2018
Doctor Strange," Nice take on a unique character.
","I'll give this a 9/10 for the excellent acting, the nice special effects, and the usual Marvel production quality. This character (Dr. Strange) could have gone horribly wrong in translation to the screen but they pretty much got it right. And I went into the theater with some trepidation because Dr.Strange is probably my favorite Marvel character of the whole works, so I really didn't want to sit through a travesty. I actually started reading the comics in the honest-to-god Steve Ditko era (declaring my age here), loved his (literally) un-Earthly other-dimensional settings, and was totally grabbed by the ongoing plot that went on issue after issue unfolding bigger, deeper layers of reality from Nightmare to Mordo to Dormammu to Eternity.Once I saw that Benedict Cumberbatch signed on for the lead role I was pretty confident that he'd capture it. (and I don't think there are that many top actors who could nail the combination of strength, self-confidence, intelligence, with just a bit of willingness to step over the edge into unreality. Robert Downey Jr may be great for Iron Man but he'd have ruined Dr.Strange.) But the other roles really filled out this movie. Rachel McAdams was great (and underused) in her role -- rightly upgraded from Night Nurse to a full-fledged doctor -- and she commanded the screen quite equally with B.C. in their scenes together. Would love to see her again. Benedict Wong was the surprise hit as the stone-faced librarian, and Chiwetel Ejiofor turned in his usual solid work as Mordo, someone who starts out on the right side but turns out to be just too rigid for his own good.Now some minor cavils (nothing huge, but these prevent me from going to 10/10).<ul><li>Tilda Swinton really commanded her role as Ancient One. The 'whitewashing' didn't bother me all that much, but what did bring an 'arrgghh' reaction was tying her power to the Dark Force, revealed at the end. That would *never* be the real (= comics) Ancient One's style.</li></ul><ul><li>Dormammu -- hmmm. Yes, he's the powerful villain Behind It All, but why just a huge black stony face?? The comics version (a complete humanoid figure, but with a head that's just a ball of flame) worked perfectly well and was plenty scary enough.</li></ul><ul><li>Where's Clea??? Can't they bring in Dr. Strange's REAL love interest, and from another dimension no less? oh well, maybe next time.</li></ul><ul><li>and I was really hoping Scott Derickson would go ALL the way to the real, Ditko-esque scenery -- alternate dimensional worlds built of nothing but overlapping geometric shapes extending off into the distance. They did get pretty close, especially in the rapid-fire 'grand tour' that the Ancient One put Stephen Strange through near the beginning. I just wanted more.</li></ul>Overall, pretty satisfying and a great addition to the Marvel movie universe.",9,1,3,22 November 2016
Interstellar," Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece
","I'll say a number of things about Interstellar but basically ... words fail me. This is one h*** of a movie. Even though it has some flaws, or at least certain things that bother me a bit, I find this film so absorbing from start to finish that I just can't resist giving it 10/10. Big-screen, big ideas, big-budget, terrific technology, a script that's not dumbed down, and a stacked cast. And the run time of almost 3 hours has not a single wasted minute -- it's not at all too long for its seamlessly interlocked plot to unfold. Everything is here -- gut-wrenching personal tragedies and triumphs, visual spectacle like nothing before, high drama, inspirational striving against huge odds, and all delivered by actors in total command. If you don't read any further, I hope this is already enough to persuade you to see it (or see it again!).TIFF was playing both Interstellar and 2001: A Space Odyssey this past month so I went in to see it in their beautiful theater space again, three years after its first release. The pro critics would see 2001 (from 1968) as its logical predecessor, and to some extent it certainly is. But it also owes a lot to 2010: The Year We Make Contact (from 1984) in its pure and accurate depiction of space travel. (As one example, take the sequence in Interstellar showing their arrival at Saturn, and compare it with 2010's arrival at Jupiter and the atmospheric braking technique. Both are visually magnificent.) But there are things in Interstellar that are entirely its own, such as the scenes of the black hole with accretion disk, its NON-singular center (a nonrotating black hole has a singular point of infinite density at its center, but a spinning black hole actually does not!), the stretching of time in a strong gravitational field, and the outside view of the wormhole with its gravitationally lensed images of galaxies on the far side. During the production it became well known that Nolan was (intelligently) relying on consultation with Kip Thorne, a theoretical astrophysicist and specialist in gravity and spacetime, and it showed. Maybe Thorne didn't get an Oscar for this work, but I'm sure he'll make do with his Nobel Prize. :) There's so much here that is done right, all the way down to the simple fact that the views outside the various spacecraft are utterly silent no matter if their thrusters are firing or they are colliding -- sound doesn't exist in a vacuum, period. The cast list is just amazing: Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, and a wonderful Mackenzie Foy as 10-year-old 'Murph' (under certain camera angles and lighting, she and Chastain as her older self look uncannily alike). Every one of them has an essential role to play in this rich and complex script. Also worth noting: thankfully it's becoming common enough now for a woman scientist to play a major role in SF and other films, but it's still very rare to have MORE than one. Here we've got both Hathaway (biologist) and Chastain (physicist), and their characters are both key players and heroes in their own right. And the advanced-AI robots on the spacecraft are predictably charming, but thankfully do NOT steal the show. This is an ensemble cast all the way through.Hans Zimmer's musical score is quite distinctive, even for him. I particularly liked the elegant dance-like motif that accompanies spacecraft travel scenes among others -- it's a gently soaring, yearning line of song that just ... never... quite ... resolves or comes to rest. On the other hand, he has a couple of suitably massive themes for the big dramatic buildups that pack a real punch.OK, for the things that bothered me a bit:<ul><li>the 'tesseract library' at the center of the black hole and the transmission of signals across time by manipulating gravity: I know it's ingenious, but it is just a bit hard to swallow. I keep wondering if there was a better way to do this, but I'll admit I can't think of one.</li></ul><ul><li>the ships would have been ripped apart going into the black hole; the tidal field around a stellar-mass b.h. is too steep for anything solid to maintain its structure.</li></ul><ul><li>with Earth's resources dwindling and monoculture crops catastrophically failing one after the other, how come everyone still drives cars and trucks everywhere? Where is the gas coming from?</li></ul>These are quibbles though. The powerful storyline and first rate production quality trump everything else. A modern classic.",10,0,1,30 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It feels as if all the previous SW movies were a training run for this one.
","Episode IX was better than I thought it would be, and the best since the Original Trilogy. It really does attempt to be the promised big, satisfying wind-up to the whole series of 9 (11?) SW films. My pros and cons:<ul><li>I'm guessing that 'and I am all the Jedi' is going to join 'and I am Iron Man' as a tagline that will live on for years to come.</li></ul><ul><li>Bravo to Daisy Ridley! Her character Rey was almost sidelined in The Last Jedi (boo) but, thank goodness, she's back center stage for this one. Ridley really committed to this role and brought a nuance and maturity to it that made it stand head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. Like Luke in the Original Trilogy, Rey develops continuously in character from the beginning of A Force Awakens to the end of Rise of Skywalker. Her acting goes well beyond what's necessary for a movie that is essentially a splashy spectacle.</li></ul><ul><li>The visual spectacle is extraordinary. I saw this on an IMAX screen and that's certainly the way to do it; all the incredible detail in the background pops out and gives the whole thing a level of texture that no previous SW film has had. When you add in the thunderous score, the 2.5-hour experience is a sensory assault that might leave you wired for hours afterwards. But isn't that why people come out to see it?</li></ul><ul><li>The obligatory 'cute droid' scenes were there, but thank goodness they were minimal.

Pacific Rim," B-movie material in the hands of an A-list director
","I didn't ever get to the theater to see this, but my daughter insisted we should watch it on her DVD copy just this month. Sure enough it's (a) completely stereotypical for big smash-'em-up SF action films with giant monsters and robots, and (b) somehow (and I'm still not sure how exactly) vastly more fun than the dreary Transformers movies that it invites comparison with. Some pro reviewers say it's because there's a good, well developed dose of human interest that the Transformers lack. I think that's part of it -- the three principals played by Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, and (stunningly beautiful) Rinko Kikuchi are engaging and worth rooting for -- but somehow that's not all. Director Guillermo del Toro just knows his way around a scene and how to stich them together into a sweeping narrative. Of course there are gaping holes in the logic. Nothing much stands to reason if you look at it closely. As one example, every one of the Kaiju (alien monster) vs. Jaeger ( human-piloted giant warrior bot) battles happens in or near large cities where massive destruction and carnage can and does ensue. If this has been going on for years now as the plot says, why in h*** is anyone at all still living in coastal cities like Hong Kong or San Francisco? But without that, the fight scenes just wouldn't be as photogenic. Never mind. The bottom line is that this is B-movie material in the hands of an A-list director who has made it rise above its limitations, at least for the time you're watching. One wonders what the filmmakers of the original 1950's monster movies (Godzilla, Rodan, and the rest) would have made of this. At very least they'd have envied all the CGI tools that can be mobilized today.",7,0,0,18 March 2018
Justice League," Part 3 of the Superman Trilogy
","Warning! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD. So if you haven't seen the movie already, come back and read this later.When I got home from the theater, my (adult) daughter who was visiting said, 'So, you went to see Wonder Woman And Her Boring Friends?' That's one way to look at it (and she's not entirely wrong), but really folks, I thought JL was pretty good and my vote of 7/10 reflects a good-but-not-great assessment. Top rank for superhero-teamup movies in my book still goes to the first Avengers and possibly the second X-Men for their quality of characters and story.JL (the movie) doesn't quite live up to the expectations generated by its huge publicity and multiple-trailer campaign, but there are a lot of good things, and a few not-so-good, that are worth saying about it. (1) A workable approach to it is -- don't overthink it. On one level, it's just fun to see all these popular characters together fighting one of DC Comics' top villains. Sort of like going to see a Star Trek movie where we get to watch the familiar gang on another adventure. The plot moves along quickly with not much time given to character-driven sidelights or extensive dialog (but see below - that's both a strength and a weakness). Not overstuffed with material like BvS was. Leave it to films like Logan and Wonder Woman to achieve such quality that they leak over into the mainstream-movie world of critical acclaim -- just go and enjoy it. (2) It turns out to be pretty even-handed about giving screen time to each major player: Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, and the long-awaited (!) Superman. As expected, they each get to do their particular things in the various fight/action scenes. And riding on the runaway success of WW's own movie this past summer, even her top fans won't have too much to complain about -- she's in a whole lot of scenes and they move her character development forward a bit more. Makes you wonder what they'll do for her 2019 sequel (if indeed it's supposed to be put into the gap between World War I and the present time), but Patty Jenkins is brilliant and will pull something off. (3) Now that it's out, we can finally see JL as the real Part Three of a Superman Trilogy. Big Blue is the one common factor linking Man of Steel (2013), Batman v Superman (2016), and now Justice League, and frankly it's great to see him back -- personally there's a limit to how much grim-and-gritty dystopianism I'm willing to watch. I'm a traditionalist, I like to see the good guys win, and I like to see a good guy who's just flat-out stronger than the bad guys. So now he's saved the world from super-aliens three times! The movies need Superman and his idealism connected with power in troubling times just as much as in happy times. This 3-film sequence also pretty easily fits a semi-Christian god-mythos interpretation: in Man of Steel we get his birth and life, in BvS his trial and (suitably heroic and sacrificial) death, and in JL his resurrection. Director Zack Snyder drove this in a bit more by framing him sitting in front of stained-glass windows, hanging in the sky with flying cape and outstretched arms, and so forth. But I'm not complaining. After the ending of MoS and BvS I wondered (along with other viewers) why the heck he hated Superman so much, but now I'm happy to back off a bit and give Snyder more credit for the longer view.(4) For my money The Flash worked out the least well. His various one-liner quips fell flat and much of the time he was just an awkward presence. If they're going to go forward with him, the character needs rethinking. At times, the dialog wasn't any better than a decent TV show. Maybe this is an unfortunate byproduct of the patchwork way that JL had to be put together (with Zack Snyder forced to leave early because of family tragedy, and Joss Whedon coming in as a late substitute with his very different tonal style). But there's no substitute for good scriptwriting.(5) The main problem with this film is that it's too short. An epic with this level of publicity buildup should have more in it. But don't stuff in more action -- what's there is plenty. Instead, what I wanted was more character interaction and especially giving more to the supporting roles (Lois, Martha, Commissioner Gordon, Silas Stone, Mera, Hippolyta, and above all the wonderful Alfred. Think about how many scenes each of them got and how brief they were!) The actors playing these roles are all first-rate, and giving them more screen time would have lifted this movie to a new level. And PS -- the Amazons once again are great!(6) The several different trailers teased a LOT of scenes and dialog (as many as 10, according to Flickering Myth) that never actually appeared in the movie itself. ???!? Something's wrong here. This is the first case of misdirection-by-trailer-overload that I've experienced and I hope Warner Brothers don't do this again.(7) Superman, just to drive it in, is really powerful! One scene shows him holding all the others at once to a standstill, and when he finally got the chance to nail Steppenwolf, you could just feel his punches landing like sledgehammers. If all I had were superhero films with Superman and Wonder Woman, I'd be just fine.",7,1,3,19 November 2017
Man of Steel," Henry Cavill is the right choice
","When I was a kid I read Superman comics especially. I liked Superman, but I had no interest at all in Batman. After all, Batman was just a guy with a lot of gadgets and a lot of money. If you were going to follow superheros then that meant people with actual superpowers. (And I never liked the heros' kid sidekicks either -- Robin, Speedy, and the others. Thankfully Superman never had one.) But nowadays, Batman is the one who fits the zeitgeist: he matches up better with our angst-ridden, dystopian age where darkness and menace seem to be everywhere. Director Zack Snyder suits that style very well. Unfortunately he's the wrong fit for Man of Steel. Superman *must* embody everything good and optimistic about the world -- he's the product not just of Krypton but of sunny Kansas wheatfields and a morality of simple truth and justice. He needs to be the best of us.I wish that Snyder and his writers had been able to buy into that; we'd have been given a much truer Superman movie that way. Instead, Henry Cavill (who, really, looks the part every inch as much as the classic Christopher Reeve) has to wade through a script full of 'problems' put on the shoulders of the Man of Steel including a tortured, secretive childhood, self-doubts and insecurities, and years as a young man spent in the shadows trying to avoid public recognition. Credit to the team that this all does work, sort of. But it's an awkward fit.Nevertheless, I (mostly) had a good time watching this in the theater. The special effects are excellent as are all the supporting cast of big-name actors. The final half-hour or so of huge action scenes where Supes has to stop the alien invasion from the Kryptonians is big, all right. The sheer scale of the action didn't bother me at all -- this is Superman! It SHOULD be big. For example, I loved the fistfight-in-the-air with Zod and his minions: it's visually imaginative and it fit beautifully what superstrong characters ought to be able to do. But it just got too complicated and went on too long.Killing Zod caused a big flap in the media, but frankly I wasn't bothered by that. The plain fact of the script is that Zod earned that reward many times over and essentially forced S into doing it, in order to save the lives of more humans about to be killed. Was he supposed to find some other way out of it?Bottom line: very worth seeing as the start to the DC Extended Universe, and well done by Henry Cavill. We couldn't foresee, though, that just 4 years later, Wonder Woman would come along -- with a different director! -- and raise the bar much higher for quality superhero movies.",8,2,2,1 July 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A pyrotechnical must-see for Marvel fans
","This is a fun, dazzling ride, no doubt at all. It's a Superhero Origin Story (young Miles Morales gets the radioactive-spider bite, but with some different results than we were expecting), an alternate-universes story (several Spideys from different universes all piled together), and a warm-hearted family drama (Miles learns his favorite uncle isn't to be admired after all, and snaps back to realizing how good his parents are after all). And it's an ultra-dazzling CGI display with style to burn. I came out of the theater with the feeling that I'd been immersed in an actual comic book for 2 hours. There's clever use of visible word balloons and sound effects (e.g. 'Thwip!' appears on the screen as Spidey shoots his webbing) and lots of split-screen action as if you're seeing several panels on a comics page at once.It's dazzling and innovative by playing to the strength of its chosen medium (animation rather than live-action). The most fun for me was the interaction of the multiple heros. The Spider-Man from the first alternate universe is a middle-aged Peter B. Parker who still has his moves, but who is now overweight, divorced, and jaundiced. Spider-Gwen has a cool black-and-white suit and in action is elegant and balletic. Spider-Man Noir is a hard-boiled PI with a black trench coat (always tossing artistically in a breeze) who talks like he's straight out of a Raymond Chandler novel. Peni Parker, a young anime Japanese girl, has kept HER radioactive spider to help run her robotic Spider-armor. And looniest of all we have Spider-Ham from a kids' cartoon universe (who walks onto camera just as Peter B. Parker finishes saying ('this could literally not get any weirder'). They all have to combine to beat the villains led by the evil Kingpin, who's about the size of an elephant with a piggish head below his shoulders and seems to be about as strong as the Hulk. Although the Spidey comics traditionally had lots of weird villains, unfortunately I thought Kingpin and his crew were kind of overdone even in the context of this movie.The jokes and situational humor, complete with self-referential in-jokes about Spider-Man's comic book history, come thick and fast. Add to this the riot of special effects and explosions of color during the final scenes and we get something that starts to collapse of its own weight. I had a great time watching it, but in the end it seemed like this movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be below its dazzling surface. (Not that this doesn't make it worth seeing, though. Yes, it's sheer fun living inside a superhero comic for that two hours.) As for the musical score -- kind of heavy-handed, I thought; we were being pushed into sensory overload.One thing that I particularly liked was the first-rate cast of actors doing the voices. Shameik Moore has the youthful Miles voice and style down pat, and Hailee Steinfeld is a perfect Gwen (I wanted more). Jake Johnson nails the soft-spoken, world-weary Peter B. Parker persona, Nic Cage pulls off Spider-Man Noir (I wanted more of him too), and the best surprise of all was Lily Tomlin as the best-sounding Aunt Mae I've ever heard (and we've have good ones in the previous live-action Spidey films).",8,1,2,30 December 2018
Dunkirk," I can't really imagine this being done any better
","I'm going to rate this a 10 (which I rarely do) because I just can't imagine this subject being done any better on film. It's going to be a certain Oscar nominee for best picture, director, cinematography, and who knows what else. My wife and I just got back from seeing it in a packed audience during its first weekend of release and we are still climbing down from the superb but unrelenting dramatic tension that carried the film from beginning to end.Although the evacuation of soldiers from Dunkirk was very early in WW II (1940) and looked like a military disaster, in fact it was already a turning point in the war because Britain successfully saved more than 330,000 soldiers from either obliteration or internment. Director Nolan tells this vast story from the shifting viewpoints of several very focused individual sub-stories which keep you totally, seat-grippingly involved: one small yacht among the armada of little boats that crossed the Channel to retrieve the soldiers; two Spitfire pilots doing battle with German bombers and fighters; a handful of soldiers trying to do nothing more than survive long enough to get on a safe boat. Take a big canvas and make it personal.The camera-work makes you feel like you are right there, right now, in the moment. The sequences in the air particularly were flat-out stunning. Some scenes you get to see multiple times from different viewpoints (desperate soldiers in the water, men on the boats, the Spitfire pilots) as the story loops around and back in incredibly clever split-time format; Nolan is a genius. And Hans Zimmer does it again for scoring music that ratchets up the tension right away and keeps it there (and just wait for his quotation of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations at the high point of victory with the arrival of the small boats).I came out of the theater realizing that it is very good to be living in a time and place without war. Yesterday I saw an item on the internet about a 97-year-old war vet who was there on the beach of Dunkirk as a 20-year-old. He saw the movie as soon as it was out and according to him, the real thing was just like that.",10,1,7,23 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," An engaging epic with enough material for two movies. Is this a once-in-a-generation event?
","First of all let me say that I was looking forward eagerly to this movie along with millions of others, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and there's no doubt you get your money's worth. For the broader fantasy/adventure genre that superhero films fit into, my high-water mark is set by the Lord of the Rings trilogy. On a scale where LOTR is 10/10, I give Wonder Woman a 9, and both Avengers Endgame and Infinity War an 8. In other words, it's darn good, and it has the high satisfaction level that the Russo brothers promised us we'd get. The production values are state of the art, and the payoff is to see *almost* every MCU character present and accounted for so that we can see them in action once more.I was surprised -- if you'll forgive the circular statement here -- by just how many surprises there were for both the plot elements and the characters themselves. It's now clear why the producers and directors kept such tight wraps on this thing before its release. Broadly speaking I was expecting that this would play out in much the same style as Infinity War, like they were the first and second halves of a 5.5-hour epic. I was wrong. It's epic all right, but stylistically, Endgame is its own film. The biggest thing I didn't see coming is that lots of the first half particularly is reflective, deliberately paced, and NOT just slam-bang CGI. As far as I'm concerned that was welcome -- the cast is populated by characters we've learned to care about so give them space to breath. It's the end of an era and it's all given a proper sendoff. At the same time, there are plenty of big, dramatic entrances that led to cheers and applause for the audience I was in. Those are glorious, and the final big action scene is over-the-top huge. The flip side, though, is that there are SO many characters in play that most of them get only a bit of screen time, not much more than cameos.One thing that was not a surprise was that most of the Endgame storyline followed the Original Six Avengers -- Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Hawkeye for one final go-round. Mostly, it's the Three Amigos that head the list. And by the end I felt like those characters have all had lots of innings by now, it's past time to move on with all the other characters we've met and who could be just as engaging. The main 'other' leads here with bigger-than-cameo roles were Ant-Man, Rhodey, and Captain Marvel, all welcome.I think the whole 22-movie arc of the MCU, and in particular Infinity War and Endgame, might qualify for being the movie event of a generation -- i.e. something so big and involving that everyone knows about it. A generation ago, it was the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A generation before that, it was 2001: A Space Odyssey and also Star Wars, two films that laid out diametrically opposite paths for the space/sci-fi genre and have both had their successors. And a generation before that? According to my parents it was Gone With The Wind, the making of which was nothing less than a national experience on a level bigger even than we're seeing now. (Just for fun, look up how movies rank in the all-time box office list after adjustment for inflation. Avengers Endgame has a ways to go yet.)About that 3-hour runtime. Too short for the material! Add another half-hour, put in an intermission, and then we'd have a true epic movie. Way back when, that's what big-budget epics were like -- things like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, How The West Was Won, El Cid, Cleopatra. They were great! Not just movies, but whole experiences. The intermission gave the audience a chance to do a washroom break, maybe get some more popcorn, clear their heads, then settle back in again. Endgame is *almost* there.Some other thoughts:<ul><li>Yes the big battlefield scene(s) toward the end make up a great orgy for the fans, but so much of it makes no sense. Various of the most powerful Avengers go one-on-one against Thanos and then get interrupted. Where's Iron Man when Carol is fighting him? Where's Wanda when Thor is going at him? They're supposed to be working together. This was too obviously just a way of giving everyone their chance at a big scene. This feels like lazy storytelling.</li></ul><ul><li>Yes! Captain Marvel is right in there and boy is she powerful, but her presence felt just a bit tacked-on -- more like a guest star. I know this was supposed to be all about the 'core' Avengers, and it is, but I wish they'd worked harder to bring her right in to the center of the story. (Great CGI too that no other MCU character has.)</li></ul><ul><li>But this movie underscores yet again that the MCU still has a gender problem. Nebula is underused (again). Wanda is underused (again). Mantis is underused (again). Carol is uber-powerful but underused. Black Widow has been treated horribly inconsistently all the way along in the MCU films, and the way she's portrayed here is yet another example. She deserved better.</li></ul><ul><li>I didn't much like the way Thor was used here either. They've pushed him so far into comedy mode that he's become a clown. Bad choice! Chris Hemsworth does light comedy well, but he's equally good as the serious God of Thunder and I wanted more of that side. The first Thor movie is one of the half-dozen best superhero films ever made, Ragnarok was also great, but here the character has become almost unrecognizable. What a letdown.</li></ul><ul><li>And speaking of Asgard, a shout-out to Rene Russo, who's marvellous. She absolutely kills the scene(s) that she is in. We sure could have used more of her.</li></ul><ul><li>There's a totally fun bit on the big battlefield where all the *female* superheros gather to form a united front. More please! This had better not be just tokenism. For example, Wanda (Scarlet Witch) is shown once again to be one of the very few heroes who was able to genuinely hurt Thanos. GIVE THIS WOMAN A MOVIE!! It doesn't hurt that Elizabeth Olsen is a first-rate actor.</li></ul><ul><li>There's so much material that it's just an embarrassment of riches. By trying not to leave anyone out in this Grand Finale, the Russos have shortchanged various scenes that could have been better. And there are loads of deserving characters, like Valkyrie, Black Panther, Shuri, Wasp, Dr. Strange, Wong ... Too much in the last hour felt rushed.</li></ul><ul><li>And about time travel. I'm not particularly giving anything away to say that it's there just like everyone expected. But just like all other time travel plots, (a) it's fun but (b) this version of it doesn't make any more sense than any other movies built on the device. Bizarre logic, plot holes, missing pieces; it seems fine as it's happening, but you're left scratching your head after the credits roll.</li></ul>",8,0,1,29 April 2019
The Favourite," Offbeat tale of palace intrigue, but the three lead actresses are great.
","The reign of Queen Anne in the early 1700's must be one of the least well-known segments of British history. We have loads of movies to choose from about Elizabeth I, Victoria, the Henrys, Richard III, and so on. But Queen Anne? I went into this movie knowing about as much as anyone else about her era -- in other words, nothing. At first, I thought this one was more in the line of a historical fantasy, but it turns out (relying on Wikipedia) that it's largely historically correct. Anne (played by Olivia Colman) did indeed have Lady Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) as a politically influential confidante, they did have a serious falling-out, and Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) replaced her, not too long before Anne's death. The story of the film is how that happened.That's the bare bones of it. The substance of the film, despite the offbeat humor that most of the scenes have, is the deadly serious tug-of-war between Lady M and Abigail, with the ultimate prize being the Queen's favor and the inside track to status and influence. The three lead actresses are all top-notch and they carry the whole film -- all others in the cast (pointedly including all the male roles of course!) are secondary. Emma Stone especially has real screen presence -- she's building up quite a resume of outstandingly varied roles in her still-young career. Colman plays the Queen as a sort of petulant dimbulb (which may NOT be historically correct, though. It seems that Anne in fact had a lot more agency than originally given credit for). She has a bad case of gout that renders her barely able to walk, but won't do anything to modify her diet or exercise accordingly. She gets browbeaten by all her advisors personal and political. who treat her as just a necessary pawn. Ultimately, however, she learns that she can exert the real power she had in her hands all along, and the subversive message of the plot is that both Sarah and Abigail, who've been infighting for power all this time, both get the rug pulled out from under them by the very person they are trying to 'capture'.Part of the fun of watching these historical costume dramas is seeing how people dressed and carried out daily things (300 years ago in this case), and this one is meticulously researched and executed. Well done! The only thing that holds me back from giving a higher rating is that it's hard to know at times what to make of it: it's as if the actors are simultaneously telling the story and also standing outside it all watching it happen. But the bottom line is -- go see this to watch three actresses at the top of their game.",8,2,3,31 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Great stuff. Bring on Avengers 4!
","The end of this movie gives new meaning to the phrase 'done and dusted', though I can't explain that without a spoiler! No doubt at all, you get your money's worth. Infinity War pulls you right in, there's never a dull moment, and it's every fan's dream to see this many heroes all at once. I'd say the strongest part of this one is just how well all of them are managed. Still -- I'm going to hold back giving this a numerical rating for IMdB till I see Avengers 4 next year. (Note added a year later: I've seen Avengers Endgame now, and I rate them both 8/10. Endgame is splashier, but Infinity War has a more tightly constructed storyline that is handled masterfully.) It's not giving anything away to say that these two movies are a duology (or actually a duology with a prelude, which is Thor Ragnarok: the action bridges seamlessly from that one to AIW.) Some things happened in TR that I wasn't fond of, but they turn out to be resolved anew in AIW. It sets up some big new problems though, so how effective AIW turns out to be will depend on how well they bring it home in A4. People who want to judge this one harshly -- just wait. This is only the first half of a bigger story. I've got my own ideas about how it's going to shake down but there are already a bunch of 'theories' being floated out there on the Web.OK: in short, this one raises the bar yet again for the genre. Marvel has a smoothly running machine that knows how to turn out a well crafted product; and I have to give their writers and planners credit for thinking way ahead -- concocting plot arcs that unfold over several films. Full credit as well for giving us a fantasy world so absorbing that you kind of have to shake yourself back to reality when the credits finally roll. I felt the same sort of way with the Lord of the Rings trilogy (the original three, not the Hobbit trilogy). Each of those three films was about 3 hours long, complex, layered, and interlocked. Is AIW at the LOTR level? No. The LOTR films were a bloody miracle. But the new Avengers is darn good.After the terrific success of Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther in just the past few months -- along with CA Civil War (2016), which was functionally Avengers 2.5 -- it wasn't clear what they could do to top all of that. And maybe if AIW turned out to be 'just as good', it could still be counted as a win. But it's better. The CGI is state of the art, the jumps between the multiple plot lines are expertly timed, and since almost all the characters are already familiar they don't need backstory time. After the first 20 minutes of so of dramatic entrances, you can just settle in and watch them go. The characters that do need introducing are the villains -- Thanos himself, who isn't actually in every scene but somehow feels like he is, and his powerful Black Order minions. Thanos has plenty of time onscreen to develop his backstory and goals, but the four Black Order chiefs are given zero backstory, essentially there to give several of our heroes something to fight.And about the heroes -- it was great to see Dr. Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Gamora being given the screen time and status they deserve. Some others may have been shortchanged, though that might mean they'll have bigger roles in A4. Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olson, Josh Brolin are superb actors, Tom Holland is good and getting better, and all the rest of the cast are more than competent. And for me the surprise of the whole film was Peter Dinklage's role, which takes the way he's shown in his other movies and delightfully stands it on its head. However, in this kind of movie the best actors won't be used to their full potential anyway, because the story itself is the main thing and they are all there primarily to keep it moving. Brolin does nicely at raising Thanos from a one-dimensional character to 2-dimensional (can't really expect anything more in superhero movies) as someone with a past and with strong reasons for his actions. He's an evil man doing the good that good cannot do (If I recall right that quote is from a Mickey Spillane novel); it's just that his idea of 'good' involves erasing half the living beings in the universe.Two other little complaints: the words 'galaxy' and 'universe' are used interchangeably (which is like comparing a grain of sand to the whole Earth). And there's a certain CGI effect repeatedly used toward the end that is directly borrowed from X-Men The Last Stand.All in all, it's great stuff. I'd go and see Avengers 4 right now if it was available.",8,1,5,28 April 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," Third time's not the charm
","First let's get some good things said about this movie -- because there are a few. Best for my money is that we get a first good look at Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde, played by Ellen Page) and her abilities, after just cameo appearances in the first two X-Men films.. She's a delight. Her extended scene at Worthington Labs running right through walls ('phasing' as it's called in the actual comics) while being chased by the thuggish Juggernaut, who smashes through them, is a highlight of the film, including the way she cleverly turns the tables on him. Another very nice scene is Storm's (Halle Berry) eulogy for Professor X (Patrick Stewart) on the sunlit schoolgrounds while surrounded by all the mutant pupils. It's nicely scripted, and it works. It was also rather fun to have Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar) around in one of the bigger roles, and he gives it some real stature.Going beyond that, it's hard to know where to start. Bryan Singer, the canny director for the first two X-films, had the right touch for this unique franchise in the superhero genre, but the shift to Brett Ratner turned out to be a big step down. (1) Far and away the worst is what was done to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). As we all expected after the end of the superb X2, she is resurrected as the ultra-powerful Phoenix -- but when using her power, instead of being surrounded by the beautiful 'bird of fire' CGI effect that we got a nice glimpse of in X2, here Jean turns into something like a sunburned witch -- no firebird at all. WTF?? Whose idea was that?? and for someone who was supposedly going to be the centerpiece of the plot, she spends a lot of time offscreen, as if the (male) writers and director just couldn't think of much to do with her. Instead, lots of screen time spent is spent with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who became the face of the franchise after his breakout success in the first X-Men. Not necessarily a bad thing, but mostly he's just going through the motions.(2) Trite, boring dialog. Magneto (Ian McKellen), who had quite a presence in X1 and X2 and conveyed a real sense of menace, is reduced to stock villainous rants that he was probably embarrassed to deliver. This sort of lazy scripting affects almost everyone's parts but it reaches bottom with him. What's almost as bad is that two of the mainstay characters, Storm and Xavier, seemingly out of nowhere are harder-edged, almost antiheros in what they do. That may be fine for Wolverine but not for them. There are plenty of villains here to go around without conscripting characters who ought to be heros.(3) And the ambience -- what had a clear, upbeat, attractive feel in the first two films is here turned into flat, ugly settings and tone. Most of the time it's just not very fun to look at. What a waste.(4) Plot and character are sacrificed for rather mindless smash-'em-up action. There's too much of it, it's not well thought out, and it's a mark of lazy moviemaking.Lastly, though this is just a minor annoyance compared with the major issues in this movie, for the third time in a row we see the Professor shuffled off to the sidelines for most of the movie. In X-Men, he's sent into a coma when Cerebro is sabotaged. In X2, he's mind-controlled into a fantasy world by Stryker's mutant son. And here in X3, he's seemingly killed off by Jean herself before any of the main action gets going. Again, this is lazy scripting -- there's so much more the Professor could do in a more thoughtfully worked out story.On the IMdB user ratings I see that women rate this one higher than men (7.1 vs 6.7), and in all age groups. There are plenty of votes so I think it's statistically significant. I'm not sure why -- for X1 and X2 the male/female ratings were quite similar.The rather poor effort of X3 coming after the successes of its two predecessors, sadly brought the X-Men franchise to a temporary halt till it was rebooted several years later with a new historical/origins approach in X-Men First Class (2011). That one had its issues too, but it got the franchise back on track. Now they're ready to try the Phoenix storyline again with Dark Phoenix in 2019. Fingers crossed. I see at least that they'll use the 'firebird' effect that we already saw from the young Jean at the climax of X-Men Apocalypse (2016).",6,0,0,15 April 2018
Room," Brie Larson in a searing, troubling, and ultimately uplifting story: big message in a small bottle
","I didn't see Room (2015) when it first hit the theaters because I knew it would be something of a downer (or worse) and I tend not to opt for those. But that, of course, is pretty short-sighted. My wife thought I should watch it even if just to see Brie Larson in her Oscar-winning role before I went to see her as a big-budget superhero in Captain Marvel (2019), so we watched Room on Netflix this week. And of course she was right -- this is a carefully thought out and crafted film that sticks in the mind afterward. Although it's fictional, sadly it's not all that fictional. We read in the news all the time about kidnapping and abduction of young women for sex-trade purposes or worse.I'm not going to worry too much about 'spoilers' in my review, coming 4 years after the fact -- the IMdB synopsis itself gives away the bare bones of the whole plot -- so I'll just go ahead with my reactions. Larson plays Joy Newsome ('Ma'), abducted on the street at age 17 by an unnamed predator (Sean Bridgers) who keeps her locked in his backyard shed as a sex slave (no other way to put it). 7 years later she now has a son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who has no knowledge of the world outside their Room except for what appears on TV. The first half of the movie shows them in their tiny, gruelling world day by day. Joy takes advantage of a temporary power outage to concoct an escape, which beyond all hope actually works. The second half of the movie is their adjustment after re-entry to the world outside (or in Jack's case, first-time entry).But no plot summary gets across the emotional impact and at-times surprising turns of the story. Though Jack is utterly bewildered at first by the reality of the larger world, as young children are very good at doing he adjusts, learns, adapts and accepts over the course of the next few weeks: meeting his grandparents, finally dressing and eating well, just being outside, making a neighborhood friend, delighting in the family dog. It's Joy who has much deeper trouble. After the Great Escape, dealing with the police and the doctors, and making the transition back to her own family home, things are not all rosy. She's unpredictably short-tempered; impatient; aimless; unhappy. She doesn't know what's wrong, experiences a physical breakdown. Shouldn't she be happy and fine? The obvious answer staring us in the face, of course, is that she's exhausted: flat-out, bone-deep exhausted, after 7 unrelenting years of captivity and five years looking out for her son every minute of every day -- protecting, feeding, training, teaching. Healing happens, but it takes far longer. This is a deeply sympathetic portrayal of a very ordinary person pushed far beyond ordinary limits, and Larson delivers every bit of it.Which brings me to the stylistic part of the movie. Everyone here is an ordinary person and acts that way. When abducted, Joy was an average high-school girl with no more personal resources or courage than average, pushed into an impossible situation. She has no particular training in dealing with motherhood, or sexual predators, or isolation and deprivation. Jack is what he is -- a kid with a kid's typical mix of behavior that is variously affectionate, obedient, self-centered, kind, shy, peevish, frightened. Their captor ('Old Nick') is menacing but also banal -- a social loser who can't hold a job and has minimal competence. Joy's escape bears no resemblance to the kind of McGyver scheme that a normal action thriller hero would come up with; her plan is not really a very good one, is also extremely risky, but it is just bold enough to work. The police officers and doctors who find them and care for them are unspectacular in turn, but they are seen to do their jobs sympathetically and well. Finally, Joy's parents Nancy and Robert (played by major actors Joan Allen and William H. Macy, in strong supporting performances) are ordinary suburban dwellers who had been forced to presume their long-lost daughter was dead. In the intervening years they have separated, and Nancy has a new partner Leo (played very effectively indeed by Tom McCamus). Both Nancy and Leo turn out to be the strengths of their newly rebuilt family: Nancy takes over Jack when Joy cannot, and Leo succeeds in making friends with him while Robert finds that he cannot.The media feeding frenzy that usually accompanies sensational news stories like this 'Woman Held Captive for Seven Years Escapes! News at 8.') is shown too, but not all that much time is spent on it. What little we get, though, does not cast reporters in a very good light. We see one very telling scene where Joy consents to do a TV interview, and the interviewer (Wendy Crewson) sideswipes her with appallingly self-righteous, judgmental questions about what she did with her son.Lastly, a shout-out to young Jacob Tremblay. He was age 9 when making the film, playing a 5-year-old, and breathtakingly convincing at it. It never occurred to me while watching that he was that much older in reality. He's just as major a figure as Larson at carrying the movie and in certain sections has to effectively carry it alone. We know how Brie Larson's career has taken off (literally, in Captain Marvel!) but it's nice to see that Tremblay is beginning to make his mark as well in other features.",9,3,6,2 March 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," In storytelling, size doesn't matter
","Here's the thing about telling a story: size doesn't matter. A small-scale personal drama -- even without any dialog (!) -- can be utterly gripping (e.g. 'All is Lost'), and contrarily a planet-smashing tale can be totally boring (e.g. any 'Transformers' -- and I'm looking at you, 'Independence Day' sequel).I'd really like to rate this X-Men instalment higher, because I'm fond of their series of movies and their characters, but I have to recognize that X-Men: Apocalypse has fallen into a trap of its own making. They seem to feel that every one of their outings has to be Bigger Than The Last Time to keep people coming. Wrong! You just need a good story to tell, and characters we can care about. The fate of the planet doesn't have to be at stake every time around. 'First Class' was good overall and 'Days of Future Past' might even be described as great. But 'Apocalypse' -- a step back.To be fair, there's lots to be positive about in many scenes. The new X-Men characters now seen in the past at a young stage are fun to see. The CGI is all fine and there are some excellent set-pieces such as Quicksilver's retrieval of all of the mutant kids *while* the school is blowing up, and the fight in Charles' mind between him and Apocalypse. The buildup to Jean finally hitting the big baddie with full power is also a good payoff for what we were all waiting for -- she cuts loose as Phoenix with the full light show and a great, blood-curdling primal scream to boot. Good stuff.But on the other hand: some things are just too much. I couldn't really go with Magneto disassembling structures everywhere around the world at once (sorry folks, but the inverse-square law works for magnetism too). Or Apocalypse blowing away Cairo with a few gestures (how many million people was that?). This is just too big to feel involved with. And sadly, some of the actors looked sort of uncomfortable. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were reliable, but I felt that Jennifer Lawrence, who's really a great actress, was kind of phoning it in here (as, frankly, she did with the Hunger Games).Once you've destroyed the Earth there's nothing obvious left to Make It Bigger but to go interstellar, which seems to be what's up for their next round in X-Men: Dark Phoenix, based on one of the top story lines from the classic X-Men comics. We'll see if they can get back on track. I hope so.",6,0,1,23 July 2017
1917," I have never seen anything on screen like this before. Cinematic genius!
","I just came back from seeing '1917', and it's a tense, absorbing, grim, and yet inspiring 2-hour journey. The theater was packed, and you could sense that every single person in the audience was mentally and emotionally glued to the screen. It's a fictional story, but built from real elements that director Sam Mendes heard from his grandfather, who acted as a messenger during WWI in just the same way as shown in the film. The WWI setting and the basic storyline sound familiar enough, but it's all in how the pieces are put together, and having seen it I now know why it's a Best Movie of the Year contender.A bit more than halfway through the movie there is an absolutely riveting centerpiece: a few British and German soldiers are trying to get through a ruined French town at night without being spotted and killed by the other side. Half-fallen buildings and corridors of stone arches are illuminated by flickering light from bombs and flares that come and go while they hide and run. It's as if we've stepped into an eerie, lurid half-world from a fever dream. I've never seen anything like this before, and words don't do do it justice -- just go and see it. This scene when added to several others feel like a tour through the circles of Hell (as in, Dante). That sequence is almost equalled toward the end when, the next morning, the battalion goes 'over the top' from the trenches while one of the messengers, Will (played by young George MacKay) runs desperately down the line across them to deliver the crucial letter (a small part of that scene appeared in the trailer but the full scene packs a far bigger punch).Aside from the big set pieces, the whole film is beautifully constructed, seems to flow organically from beginning to end. Like the ads say, it feels like 'one long take' (which it really isn't, but it goes further with that technique than any other film I know of). What that does do, however, is make the action relentlessly personal and individual with the focus on the two messengers, Tom and Will. The two lead actors MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman nail it as two ordinary soldiers asked to do things that no human should have to experience. They are not superheros: the real heroism, for them, is simply surviving and persisting through their own fear and confusion, long enough to get their job done. Bigger names like Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, and Andrew Scott fill roles that are essentially big cameos, but they importantly bookend the story.And I also want to mention Thomas Newman's musical score. It's superb. It's unobtrusive (or silent) when it needs to be, and epic when it needs to be: it emphasizes what's going on without taking over.100 years after the actual events, I don't know if it's possible to get any closer than this to recovering the lived experience of World War I from the viewpoint of the individual soldiers. A great companion piece to '1917' would be Peter Jackson's documentary 'They Shall Not Grow Old' (2018) built from recovered and restored film footage taken during the actual war. It's brilliant too, but in a different way. But it verifies that '1917' almost uncannily hits the right notes. WWI can never be portrayed as anything other than horrific, but (maybe for that reason) it's been a magnet for lots of past movies good and bad. Some other recent films that use WWI very effectively though much more briefly in their storylines are 'Passchendaele' (2008, Canadian-made), 'Tolkien' (2018), and (yes) 'Wonder Woman' (2017). But '1917' goes past them all.",10,8,11,11 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," These are the most expensive kids' movies ever made
","My wife and I saw this just last week, when it was really at the very end of its theatre run. From the IMDb vote breakdown I see that women rate this one notably higher than men, in all age groups. But also that male voters outnumber female voters by 7 to 1, which isn't surprising. The median vote is 8/10 but -- no way. If you remove the nostalgia factor and the 'modern myth' juggernaut status of the Star Wars franchise complete with all the spinoff books and TV -- it just doesn't stand up very well as a movie on its own merit. I give it 5/10 because it's technically very competent, but inside the surface layer of actions and special effects it's an empty shell. There's lots of activity to keep your eyes moving, all the favorite characters get their chances to strut and fret their hour upon the stage, but ...<ul><li>More than anything it's just overstuffed. I'd say it was about 40 minutes too long all told; there were at least two stages where it looked like it was going to wind up fairly nicely but then went on into another 20 minutes of another subplot. </li></ul><ul><li>Like all the others in the series, the dialog is about at the level of lazy 10-year-olds. What was fresh and energetic in the first film ('Episode IV') is now just numbing. The characters spend a lot of time stating the obvious or looking 'meaningfully' off to the side. With the budget these films have, can't they invest more in scriptwriters who are capable of challenging and delighting their viewers at a deeper level? What's even worse is that this simplistic dialog, designed only to set up equally simplistic action scenes, has the side effect of reducing all the actors to the same low level. And there are some excellent actors here -- Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Laura Dern, Lupita N'yongo, Benicio Del Toro among others, so a lot of raw talent was wasted.</li></ul><ul><li>To get further into the content: IMHO it seems to me that a lot of people went to The Last Jedi expecting to see a lot more of Rey and Luke together, since that was the Big Windup in Episode VII and the obvious segue to VIII. And we got something, but that sequence was so chopped up with cuts back and forth to various superficially tense action scenes that this key central part all felt shortchanged. Rey was the central hero in The Force Awakens (yay!) but her role was sadly reduced in favor of more boys'-club action.</li></ul><ul><li>The scriptwriters can pull any devices they want, of course, since all the action and plot here is arbitrary in the first place, but the clear message from The Last Jedi is that Kylo Ren is just evil. Forget those constant hints about him being misunderstood or misguided or conflicted. He's doing what he's doing because he wants to rule the roost, and he says so right out front. Forget whatever issues he had as a youngster; like Darth Vader and mad dogs, he needs to be put down, period, for the good of the Galaxy.</li></ul><ul><li>To give credit where credit is due (SPOILERS!!), I did enjoy a couple of genuinely surprising and inventive tricks: the first was the way that the evil emperor Snoke was killed off by Ren with a remote-controlled light sabre (but see above -- Ren didn't do this because he was being drawn to the Light -- he did it because he wants to take over). That surprised me, because following the pattern of the IV/V/VI trilogy I was automatically expecting that Snoke would meet his inevitable end only in IX. The second fun bit was having the rebels' cruiser zap into warp speed right through the enemy battleship, which gave quite a nicely done (and new) CGI effect. (But then we watch Finn and Rose on that broken battleship run around for a long time trying to get away *while the broken structure is wide open to empty space*! Don't they need to breathe all of a sudden?)</li></ul><ul><li>But there's just so much here that doesn't make any sense. The basis of the action is about at the level of the ancient Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon black-and-white movie serials though dressed up with CGI that is several generations better. (And I can't help recalling that the first Star Wars film was in large part a loving, retro homage to those even older kids' serials. That's how it started.) The last straw was when the small band of remaining rebels reaches this last isolated moon (conveniently with breathable atmosphere, which they all seem to have) but in about 5 minutes they are surrounded by Ren and zillions of huge mechanized war machines of all kinds. How the h*** did all that get there so quickly? When the following blizzard of firing and explosions went on is when I finally leaned over and said 'this is ridiculous' to my wife. She'd reached that conclusion a lot earlier.</li></ul>",5,6,9,18 February 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," What is reality?
","Science fiction writer Philip K. Dick was born a couple of decades too soon. His output of stories and novels mainly in the 1960's and 70's were ahead of their time, or else too far off on a track of their own, even for the world of SF in his day. But now they're a gold mine for some of our most mind-bending movie and TV plots being made long after his death, often invoking nightmarish alternate worlds of hidden levels behind our apparently normal realities. These include Blade Runner, Minority Report, Paycheck, The Man in the High Castle, and The Adjustment Bureau among others.The Adjustment Bureau is fun to watch and it's built on one simple but powerful idea (SPOILERS!): our individual histories and lives are constantly being monitored and tweaked by an organization (the Bureau) to make sure that they don't disrupt the Plan laid down by the Chairman, i.e. a God who's never on screen. Their operatives are an anonymous bunch of men in black suits and fedoras who can use ordinary doors to go from anywhere to anywhere else. (Interestingly the one thing they can't seem to do, however, is travel through time.) One clever device the movie introduces is the set of notebooks the operatives carry around, which have map pages that change in real time as their assigned targets move around, as if everyone in the world has a tracker.This movie builds on its two main stars Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, who are two of the most attractive, versatile, and bankable actors we've got. For them, this movie is a pay-the-bills kind of role, but they still do good work. Supporting roles by Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, and Terence Stamp are all fine as well. To give the script credit, it openly raises decent philosophical questions about free will and whether anyone, even the Chairman, should change the destinies of two people who will be very happy together. The main thing that I think holds this movie back from being more prominent might just be its budget and its level of ambition. It's generally well executed, but it stays small and at the B-movie level. It's not hard though to imagine a bigger-scale version, because the central idea of Hidden Reality beneath our own and manipulation of lives by shadowy operatives is just too good.One last note -- the storyline reminded me of Isaac Asimov's novel The End of Eternity (from WAY back in 1955, well before Dick was writing). It's essentially the opposite side of the same coin: Asimov's story is built on the idea that lives and histories are 'adjusted' by operatives who can shuttle back and forth in time (but not space). It could make a good movie too.",7,1,2,21 September 2017
How to Train Your Dragon," This is a practically perfect movie, and an instant classic!
","After several years' interval I watched this movie again on our DVD copy and, just like the first time around, I loved this. I rank it along with Inside Out, Up, Wall-E, and Toy Story as one of the best animated movies ever made. What do these have in common? It's the combination of a good story to tell; engaging characters to root for; a clever script; and maybe most important, human heart and passion. HTTYD has the advantage of a truly original concept -- I couldn't remember seeing anything like it before. And as far as the story goes, there really isn't a single character in the list that we don't actually like. No villains! Just a conflict between a Viking village and the neighboring dragon population that turns out, in the end, to be all a mistake.Jay Baruchel perfectly captures the adolescent voice of young Hiccup, the misfit son of village chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). Hiccup is an apprentice to blacksmith Gobber (Craig Ferguson) and thus (importantly to the plot) knows how to make and build things. Like his friends, he's trying to fit into the standard mold of a rough dragon-killer Viking, but he's not really cut out for it. He is, however, smart and curious, and that leads him onto a much more important path. His peer group of teens includes pseudo-macho Snotlout (Jonah Hill), fat kid Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Ruffnut and Tuffnut (T.J.Miller, Kristin Wiig) who'd rather fight with each other than anything else, and of course the fierce Astrid (America Ferrara), who Hiccup would do anything to impress. The hilarious series of training sessions for dragon fighting that they go through are among the best scenes in the movie.The best scenes of all, though, are with Hiccup and Toothless, the Night Fury dragon he accidentally netted during the very first scene. Unknown to everyone else in the village, Hiccup sneaks off to the woods every day to train with Toothless so that they gradually bond together into a seamless dragon and rider team. The many flying scenes that go along with this are wonderfully rendered with animation that is exactly as good as it needs to be. The 2014 sequel (How to Train Your Dragon 2) is more lifelike and detailed, but that does NOT mean it's more effective. The essential thing is that the animation in the sequel leaves less to the imagination -- and engaging our imagination is what a film like this should be all about. The only thing that leaves us sort of scratching our heads is that the 'Vikings' all have Scots accents (but only the adults! The teens speak in Standard American.) Nevertheless, it's so charming that it's easy to give that a pass.There are two other things that put this movie over the top for me. One is John Powell's music score, with evocative and versatile Celtic-style themes that actually stick in the mind. The other has to do with all the attention to detail that make the dragons more real and personable -- for example, the lovable way Toothless cocks his ears asymmetrically, or the way he scorches a little circle in the grass before settling down for a nap (a fun homage to the way dogs turn round and round before doing the same). Toothless has the full range of expressions and body language to turn him into a full-fledged personality. All of these add to the richness of texture of the whole story.There's hardly a single scene without perfectly timed humor, and the 98-minute run time goes by like the wind with not a single wasted moment. Kudos to directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders and to the whole crew for making a tightly constructed masterpiece. The one big advantage of seeing it first in the theater was the 3D rendering, which actually had real added value.",9,2,4,31 December 2018
The Shape of Water," Impeccably produced and acted
","Guillermo del Toro is a master at the fantasy-romance genre and this one fits right in, despite the fact that it's put in an almost obsessively realistic 1960's period setting. In fact, it's halfway like a fairy tale (think: the Frog Prince). It's impeccably crafted and impeccably acted by a cast that's first rate from top to bottom. Sally Hawkins as the lead actress, the mute Elisa who works as a janitor in the secret research facility, is excellent but I think it's not fair to single her out at the expense of the others: Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Shannon, and of course Doug Jones as the 'creature' all get lots of screen time and are all totally convincing. Another feature of the progress of the story that I liked was that the Amphibian Man -- which (check it out) is practically a double for the Creature From the Black Lagoon -- is revealed in his full form almost right from the start. The point, clearly, is not to score cheap horror points off his appearance, but to move right on to Elisa's unexplained fascination with him and their growing relationship.The fairy-tale ending is both satisfying and yet oddly tragic. The main thing that keeps me from rating this unique film higher is, in a way, its greatest strength: It's pure, self contained storytelling with no links (or at least none that seem intentional) to anything outside itself. It's an absorbing world while we're in it, though.",8,33,60,3 February 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," A classic reworking of a classic mystery
","This is clearly Kenneth Branagh's work above all: he's the star, the director, and the co-producer, and you can feel his influence from start to finish. And that's not a bad thing. If you're going to give this amount of control and influence to one artist, he's certainly among the better choices. Even if you happen to know the plot and the really quite clever key to the murder, you'll enjoy this movie thoroughly. On one level, it's just a lot of fun to see the all-star cast of supporting players mix and match with Hercule Poirot as they go along, just like it was in the 1974 film version of the story. It's a genuine classic.Branagh himself plays Poirot with an engagingly different slant than in previous takes on the Agatha Christie character (notably David Suchet, Peter Ustinov, and Albert Finney). While just as cerebral and quick-thinking, Poirot here is rather more emotional: he reacts to crime almost as if it's a personal insult and attacks it with almost the intensity of an avenging angel. The urge to solve this murder (or any murder, as we see right at the end when a messenger tells him that he's needed to solve a new case of violent death 'on the bloody Nile' (!)) even overrides his desperate desire to take a long-needed vacation. He just can't resist.Big names or not, everyone else in the cast is excellent and I won't mention them by name because you will enjoy them all once you see it. The cinematography has a warm color palette that you can settle right into, with added long shots of mountain scenery that are beautiful in their own right. Period costuming, the setting inside the train, the ambiance of high society of the time -- everything is nicely put together.Totally enjoyable movie-going; no deep messages about human nature of the meaning of life, but just a classic story told in a classic way told through a first-rate production.",8,1,4,19 November 2017
Arrival," A triumph for Amy Adams, and for science fiction in film
","Rating a film 10/10 is very rare for me, but this one absolutely deserves it. It's a masterwork from Denis Villeneuve, and this is also a triumph for Amy Adams. She joins a very small list of first-rate actresses who carried the entire weight of a science fiction movie on their shoulders, along with Jodie Foster (Contact), Helen Hunt (Twister), and Sandra Bullock (Gravity). In 'Arrival', Jeremy Renner gets co-lead billing (and is excellent as well) but it's really Adams who is the story from start to finish.It's based on 'The Story of Your Life' by writer Ted Chiang, but Villeneuve and his writing crew made quite a few pretty substantial changes, and I think the result is actually better on screen that it was on the page. In Chiang's story, the aliens (the Heptapods) stay in orbit, and communicate with humans only by way of a sort of holograph station on the ground. And when they leave again, they just ... go. No explanation given and no closure to the story. The movie is, overall, a richer and more satisfying experience.This movie is unapologetically cerebral in the way it's built on the central concepts of language and communication. How do you start communicating with these new aliens when you have to start from ground zero with absolutely NOTHING in common (not even your planet)? Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the linguist, is the central player in the team that gets it done, and bit by fascinating bit we get to see how it happens. The process is not rushed, and (!) despite the military camp setting where the action happens, it's not violent. (There is one smallish explosion, and a bit of offstage gunfire, but that's it.) What a pleasure to watch a science fiction film that's not just a CGI slugfest. Actually, those so-called action-SF films aren't really SF at all - they're just the empty, boring calories of eye candy. 'Arrival' is the real thing. It's an intelligent, idea-driven, gripping story that lives and breathes in an imagined world just beyond our own.One feature of the story that I liked very much was the simple but effective device that not everything was explained. Who are the heptapods, really, and where did they come from? How do they control gravity within their ships, and how do they manage interstellar travel? Most of all, why contact us? We understand by the end that they came here to teach us their language because 3000 years in the future they are going to need us, but what exactly are we going to do for them? These things are just left for us to think over. The same approach was used in Robert Zemeckis' 'Contact' (1997), when the alien race who transmit The Message to us bring Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) through a series of wormholes to meet them. But then we learn that these aliens did NOT build the wormholes, and they don't know who did; all they can say is 'Maybe they'll come back some day.' All of a sudden, yet another vista opens up. Though the benevolent Messagers are staggeringly more advanced than humans, somewhere/when there are the Tunnel Builders who are just as far beyond them. Levels upon levels. Both of these films gain extra depth and richness by invoking vastly wider context lying beyond what we get to see.(SPOILER ALERT! From here on, don't read if you haven't yet seen the film.) On a different level, the story is about Louise herself and her personal journey. Adams' understated style perfectly fits the character of a woman who's introverted by nature but who has the quiet confidence of an accomplished expert in her field. Her eyes always reveal that she's thinking and observing. At the beginning, the impression from a fragmented series of little flashbacks is that she must have lost a child to terminal illness but has moved on from that tragedy to continue with her academic university life. Then the aliens arrive, in a dozen locations all over the Earth; they're not attacking, not actually doing anything at all, but not leaving either. She's conscripted to help with the project of how to talk to them. Physicist Ian Donnelly (Renner), as team leader, develops into a close co-worker and eventually into a fledgling romantic interest. But her flashbacks continue, getting worse and worse as she succeeds in getting deeper into the Heptapods' minds. It's a slow-burn mystery, and somewhere along the line it gradually becomes clear that she's quite literally remembering her own future, not her past. At this point, the story becomes not just a path to solving the puzzle of the aliens' logographic language, but a kind of time-travel SF. Louise is going to succeed in learning Heptapod because, in the future, she HAS succeeded, and can reach back to teach herself (with the help of the clues the Heptapods plant in her). The fact that her actions save the world from nuclear war and set humanity on a new path are just nice byproducts of the storyline. Closing the loop brings the story to a completely satisfying end.The most memorable line in the film is, without a doubt, 'Abbott is death process', though I'm admittedly lifting it out of the context that gives it full meaning. This gently spoken little bit of dialog, translated from Heptapod, has to be among the most poignant in any movie. I'd love to see more of Ted Chiang's intelligent stories put onto the screen. One that would work particularly well should be his 'Tower of Babel' which is just mind-bendingly clever and would look great on the screen.",10,1,3,20 November 2017
Parasite," A clever, very modern tragicomedy.
","I'm not sure I would have seen this film without my wife's prodding, and it's partly because of the title. It's accurate enough to the storyline but as an English word it's a bit creepy in tone. I think it needed a somewhat different translation from the original Korean. But on to the film itself: obviously it's a labor of love for Bong Joon Ho, who's the writer, director, and producer. I didn't know any of the actors beforehand but they are all just fine, and they do a great job at making each one have distinct personalities among a fairly big cast of speaking roles. I also like that in our theater we got subtitles rather than some clumsy dubbing. (and the subtitles are the best and most accurate I've seen in recent times.)For lack of a better term I would describe this as a tragicomedy. A slum-dwelling family of four in an unnamed Korean city live by their wits on odd jobs. Through a series clever little twists they find a way to gradually insinuate themselves into jobs as servants to a young rich suburbanite family who never suspect what they're getting. (The young family are indeed rich enough to pay a whole coterie of servants including a driver, tutor, housekeeper, and nanny, but they're not uber-rich like the Crazy Rich Asians -- they actually do work hard and have their own issues. Not knowing any better, I'll take it for granted that their ultra-modern Western-style home and garden are realistic depictions of that class.) For about the first half of the movie this plotline is played for a good deal of humor. But then through another series of twists this house of cards comes down and things go sideways , leading to a rather shocking final scene. Quite a lot hinges on the maybe-improbable presence of a hidden underground bunker and a key character introduced very late in the story (no spoilers). There turns out to be more than one 'parasite' at work, and it's more than just the young rich folks who don't know what they are getting into.It's a complex, multilayered story (2:12 run time) and the director throws quite a lot at us. But there are no wasted or unnecessary scenes. A prominent example is during a freak torrential rainstorm. The rich folks (on the high ground, as we notice for the first time) just sit inside their beautiful garden, while the poor slum dwellers cannot save their pathetic basement flat from being washed away (complete with raw sewage in the streets). It's excruciating to watch, and this is where the message hits home. Basically decent people are forced into doing things they shouldn't do by their own circumstances and there is in the end nothing they can do to escape. The message that class determines destiny was quite a bit more overt in Bong's previous effort Snowpiercer, but it's present here too throughout.At the end, everyone is left damaged, but we're given a wistful little coda that holds out just a tiny ray of hope. That's only human.",8,1,2,18 December 2019
Wonder Woman," 'Goodbye, brother'
","This isn't a perfect film (what is??), but the reviews and audience reactions from all age groups and both genders already say this is a landmark cinema event. This is a fully fledged female-superhero movie, period. Is WW really going to be the sea-change in the superhero genre that has been WAY too long in coming? We'll see. But either way, all other female superhero films are going to be compared to this one. Even more, this film has changed my view of what superhero movies can be. It's right at the top of the list in terms of emotional connections with the characters and feeling that things somehow MATTER. I haven't felt that way coming out of this kind of movie since X-Men United (2003).Going beyond that, WW might also save the whole DCEU franchise by turning away from the glum, violent, angst-ridden 'style' of Zack Synder's Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. That approach admittedly suits Batman pretty well, but absolutely not for Superman and not for Wonder Woman. Brava, Patty Jenkins.Earlier female superhero movies including Supergirl (1984), Catwoman (2004), Elektra (2005) suffered from poor scripts and poor budgets. Good intentions aren't enough. (Another one that's actually pretty decent is Aeon Flux (2005) starring Charlize Theron. Before the casting of WW was announced, Theron would have been my instinctive choice for the role given her commanding physical presence and action-film cred that also includes Hancock, Mad Max Fury Road, and Atomic Blonde.) But Gal Gadot turns out to be great. I've seen this 4 times, and every time I've come away more impressed with her. Going in the first time around I expected she'd turn in just a steady 'OK' type of performance -- but she was a LOT better than OK. She has the necessary athleticism, she inhabits WW from the inside out, and she delivers her lines with absolute conviction. She *is* Diana so thoroughly that now you can't imagine anyone else doing it. Casting Gal Gadot might be the best thing Zack Snyder will ever do for the DCEU.And the No Man's Land sequence! It's the central pivot on which the entire movie turns, because (as Patty Jenkins said) it's where Diana becomes Wonder Woman. I haven't felt a deep-seated thrill like this from a movie scene since the finale of X2, or the Lord of the Rings classics (remember the signal fires on the mountaintops from ROTK? Or the opening of The Two Towers? Like that.). But also huge credit to Rupert Gregson Williams' music: instead of something hard and jittery, he composes majestic, measured, deeply emotional music that is all the more effective to accompany the heroism on screen -- which not coincidentally, reminded me of Howard Shore's music for LOTR. I hope his luminous score gets an Oscar nom.Diana of Themiscyra, as Wonder Woman, is heroic, but oddly, she is never courageous (!). That's because one of Diana's defining characteristics is that she's fearless, and without fear you don't need courage. She has an utterly clear mission in her mind and simply tackles everything head-on without letting anyone or anything stand in her way. (After all, why should she follow the lead of any of the men fighting this endless war? She's an Amazon, and Amazonian royalty to boot.) Another surprising treat is Gadot's thousand-watt smile, which we never got to see in the humorless BvS. and boy can she fight! The action sequences are among the best in this whole genre. I loved the two scenes that framed Diana's time with Steve (which I haven't seen anyone else mention). On their first meeting, having saved him from drowning, she reaches toward his face with a flickering smile while curiosity and delight run across her face. The last time, looking at his photo in Trafalgar Square, she again reaches gently toward his picture while grief, memory, and (again) a flickering smile cross her face. Lovely.My favorite line in the whole film is the very last one spoken, and it comes just before Diana blasts Ares to pieces: 'Goodbye, brother'. It shows that (a) she has finally come to terms with her full identity and power, and (b) she is now the only Greek god left on Earth.Among lots of positives in this movie, two things that didn't really work for me were the sidekicks who tag along with Diana and Steve (although I was more OK with them on the second viewing), and the evil/mad chemist Dr. Maru (her character never got filled out and just felt odd).Bottom line? I'm with the young kids who think Wonder Woman is awesome. Hope, idealism, and love do not go out of style. I can't wait to see WW in Justice League, and in her own sequel!",9,7,18,13 June 2017
Black Panther," 'Do you know what I call them?... sneakers!'
","The best superhero films of all (no particular order) are X-Men United, Iron Man (I), Thor (I), The Avengers (I), and Wonder Woman. Does Black Panther join that list? Maybe. It's hard to argue with the rave success it's having with audiences in theaters all over Africa, who are finally seeing themselves represented on screen. So bravo to that. I give this a solid 8/10 but if anyone wants to give this a 10/10 for its cultural impact alone, fine. (A personal footnote: I don't ever see myself 'represented' in any superhero film characters at all, so in a sense I can feel free to identify with whoever I want. The closest I would come would probably be Hank Pym or Doctor Strange, but even those are bit of a stretch.)I like to look at the demographic breakdown of the IMDb rankings and in this case it's interesting that women rate it notably higher than men, in all age groups. Is the reason as simple as that there are so many very active female supporting characters? Those characters are good -- I thought Letitia Wright's portrayal of young Shuri was the most interesting role of the whole works. As the hero, Chadwick Boseman is kind of stuck being required to be noble and honorable all the time, so he's a little one-dimensional. But, I can't avoid pointing out that supporting characters aside, all the head honchos in this movie are still male. That's why Wonder Woman still stands alone, and why I'm looking forward to Captain Marvel (and even Black Widow if that does get made). It's a fine ensemble cast and they are all nicely invested in their characters. It was fun to listen to the Xhosa-accented English from the Wakandans throughout the film -- you get so used to it that when Eric Killmonger drops in with his Los Angeles-street accent (that we would normally be quite used to hearing) it actually jars. It's clear that this guy doesn't fit in and has to be removed as quickly as possible. Wakandan origin or not, he's beyond saving. For the rest of it, Marvel pulls off its normal excellent production values, and the action, scenery, backdrops, and special effects all have a high-gloss richness and texture that you associate (e.g.) with Steven Spielberg at his best. (The bright African sunlight doesn't hurt the colorful cinematography either.) One thing that I couldn't quite buy into was the Wakanda setting itself where we see traditional rural agrarian tribal life put right up against this futurist techno-ShangriLa. if their society is really this advanced, then why in heck do they choose a king by holding a primitive, brutal hand-to-hand combat ritual? Really, they need to get rid of that .... And the armored rhinos kind of went over the top for me. The on-screen Black Panther here and his techno-marvel suit are a powerful step up from what the character did in the actual comics, though I was never particularly interested in the BP character back then -- he seemed too much like Spidey or Captain America. In the movie MCU, however, they seem to have decided to make BP a major player in the whole greater story in which this is one more building block. After I left the theater I realized that BP felt quite a bit like a good James Bond film -- it zips around to multinational settings,it never lags, it gets through a lot of plot, and it gives you lots to look at for your money. I see that some writers give BP credit for 'discussing' world issues like immigration and the responsibilities of advanced nations to help others, but it seems like those kinds of things were just raised rather than really tackled. Can't have it all.On to Infinity War.",8,1,6,22 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," This will be remembered for Wonder Woman's debut
","As I write this, the new solo Wonder Woman movie is playing to rave reviews and bringing in trainloads of box office dollars. The lesson? For me, it says that (a) people actually still like to get a positive upbeat feeling in this type of film, (b) they respond to something genuinely new (a female superhero! and totally carrying the movie!), and (c) you need to match the right director to the right material. At the theater where I saw BvS (as was the case everywhere), the audience spontaneously cheered when Wonder Woman made her dramatic fighting entrance in the middle of the battle against the Doomsday creature. Everyone had been waiting for her! Yes, BvS is constantly entertaining and slickly produced with good actors. And the opening scene -- a flashback to the destruction of Metropolis during Man of Steel, now as seen from ground level -- is terrific. A vast battle between cosmic forces is happening above the city as the people below (including Bruce Wayne) watch helplessly. But did we have to go on from there to the end of the film when now Gotham City is a smoking ruin too? The journey in between has enough material for two movies, leaving you wishing for a clearer, cleaner line without quite so many side trails.Which brings us to the director. Zack Snyder has a very uneven relationship with this material. I admit Snyder's preference for dark, gritty, tortured personalities and loads of bludgeoning action fits Batman pretty darn well (and Watchmen, his earlier effort). After all, Batman sort of represents the zeitgeist of our age. But Superman? Wonder Woman? That's where the real mismatch comes in. Superman needs to be sunny Kansas wheatfields and titanic deeds in the name of all that is pure, simple, and good in humanity. And stylistically that just isn't Zack Snyder, try as he might. The whole premise of the plot -- that somehow Batman and the American Congress would actually be suspicious enough to destroy someone who saved the planet from an alien invasion -- just rings false. I found it hard to buy into. And of course the head-to-head battle is a bit of a cheat. If Superman has his normal powers, it's no contest, but if Batman uses kryptonite, it's also no contest. A 'fair fight' between them is impossible. Superman vs. Wonder Woman, which has happened in the comics, would be more interesting.Give credit to all the main actors though for wading through this material. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill are fine, and Gal Gadot shows us a glimpse of what would emerge next year in a great Wonder Woman. Good work as well from Jeremy Irons, Amy Adams, Holly Hunter, Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Lane, and Laurence Fishburne. Without them it would be much less interesting.",7,0,2,24 June 2017
X2: X-Men United," One of the half-dozen best superhero films, hands down
","In the X-Men comics, the Jean Grey/Phoenix/Dark Phoenix sequence originally from the 1970's and 80's was one of the all-time great storylines in all of comics history. In fact, it's still going, because Marvel realized (somewhat too late) just how powerful that theme was with the fans. The echos and spinoffs from the Phoenix saga have kept resonating through all the X-Men titles with follow-on characters like the post-Phoenix real Jean Grey (in the long-running X-Factor series), her apparent clone Madelyne Pryor (whom Scott Summers married when Jean was MIA and presumed dead, had a son with, then separated), Rachel Grey/Summers (the daughter of Jean and Scott from an alternate timeline), and ongoing conflicts between Scott and Wolverine, Jean's two lovers. And the Phoenix entity itself keeps showing up, once in a while. Jean herself has been put through a confusing near-endless cycle of death/resurrection/Phoenix re-animation, though it seems unlikely any of these would make it into the movies, since the X-films have now defined a path of their own.According to screenwriter Zak Penn, the original concept for the movie X2 (X-Men United) was to go all the way into the Phoenix story, but he persuaded director Bryan Singer to hold back on it till the X-Men movie world was more well established. On its own merit I'd say that was a wise move; it's just that in X3 (2006) under different director Brett Ratner, they actually did go into Phoenix and messed it up. However, hope springs eternal. We'll see what the new Dark Phoenix (2019) has to show us next year with the rebooted younger X-Men cast. Fingers crossed.Anyway, in X2 we just get three short moments when the Phoenix entity makes its appearance within Jean as a sort of prelude, but they're exciting moments in themselves and a key to the big climactic scene that is the payoff to the whole movie. From the moment of its theater release (2003) X2 has been one of my favorite movies, let alone superhero movies. And I'll say that a rating of 10/10 doesn't mean 'perfect', which as far as I'm concerned can't be defined for films; it just reflects how I feel about it. I watched this again on DVD just this week and it still holds up very well against all the other movies in this now-big genre. My 'top 5' list of all-time best superhero flicks right now is (no particular order) X2, Thor, Iron Man, Avengers, and Wonder Woman. What do they have in common? The answer isn't great special effects, although they all have that. It's (a) storyline and (b) characters that we care about, just like in any good movie of any genre. X2 from 15 years back is the oldest of these. Its special effects are just fine for what it needs, but the point is that it does NOT rely on its big action sequences as its whole reason for being. It's what happens BETWEEN those action set pieces that matters: the story, the characters, the dialog. If those are good, then you've got something that lasts. After the success of the first X-Men (2000) we eagerly looked forward to the second instalment with anticipation and a bit of anxiety: would it be as good? maybe even better? It delivered, and that was important: the whole idea of the superhero genre was very new then and its eventual success was not at all guaranteed. The familiar X-people were back, the key actors were more comfortable with their roles, and the new people (Nightcrawler, Pyro, and brief bits by Colossus and Shadowcat) fitted in well -- the opening scene of the movie where Nightcrawler blitzes the White House guards to get to the president is one of the great introductions to a character who's going to play a substantial role in the rest of the movie.The X-Men franchise has had some distinctive things going for it compared with the MCU. Right from the start, it's had something closer to gender parity with Storm, Jean, Mystique, Rogue all having strong roles. (And X2 easily passes the Bechdel test: as an example, see the scenes between Jean and Storm when they go off to track down Nightcrawler.) This is ground that the MCU still hasn't covered 15 years later. Another strong point is that the dialog and direction of the X-films doesn't rely on Joss Whedon-like self-referential humor, irony, or snark. Those have their place -- at Whedon's best, it's brilliant -- but at times it's just nice to watch something that takes itself seriously and where the issues feel real. Wonder Woman (2017) fits that category, too.On repeated viewings of X2, though, you really start to admire the structure of the plot -- its complex web of interlocking storylines and characters, and the patient way in which it all unfolds until everything finally comes together in the last half-hour. Just about every piece of the web that appears in the first half of the film, large or small, gets used in the second half. If your movie is just a framework for running from one action scene to another for the sake of eye candy, you can't do that. Who is actually the central character, among this big cast and complex story? Logan (Hugh Jackman) is the center of a sub-plot about uncovering his own origin, but he's not at the epicenter of the entire film. Magneto (Ian McKellen) is in a lot of scenes and is the leader of a sort of parallel attack on Stryker, but again no. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is MIA in the middle of the film (again!) and surprisingly we hardly notice. As I hinted above, this movie belongs to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). On a second or third viewing, you can see the ending coming in what happens with Jean throughout the film (including, especially, the first appearances of the immensely powerful Phoenix force within her). And it's the last 15 minutes that lift this movie from good to great. Jean's heartrending, fully self-aware sacrifice allows all the rest of the team to survive, along with the mutant kids rescued from the evil Stryker's clutches. Greater love hath no man. The emotional kick of this scene is doubled by the grief pouring out from Scott and Logan, who both desperately loved her in different ways. Not that there aren't other good action sequences at well calibrated intervals. There's the visit of Bobby, Rogue, Pyro, and Wolverine to Bobby's parents' house (where we get the best line of the film from Bobby's mother, 'Have you tried ... not being a mutant?), which goes sideways when the police arrive. There's the Blackbird chase by two fighter planes, with the moment when the Phoenix force first pops up; the all-out violence of the fight between Wolverine and Deathstryke; and the extended battle within the giant hydropower dam-turned-lab. But again, it's what happens between these that is important. The characters develop, interact, grow, and end up different people than they started.It was a letdown that X3 (2006) couldn't continue the string. The franchise wouldn't rise to these heights again until Days of Future Past (2014). We'll see what next year's Dark Phoenix has to bring. The storyline is still begging for a good treatment.(A footnote: Jean Grey is a puzzingly colorless name (no pun intended) given that it's from Stan Lee himself, that lovable promoter and genius behind the Marvel superhero universe. Stan came up with loads of strong and/or alliterative names for his comics characters like Susan Storm; Peter Parker; Jessica Jones; Luke Cage; Ororo Munroe; Scott Summers; Rogue; Reed Richards; Ben Grimm; Stephen Strange; Nick Fury; and dozens more. Why something so ordinary?)",10,2,3,8 April 2018
Moonrise Kingdom," This is Wes Anderson's masterpiece
","The only reason I rate this 10/10 is that the IMdB scale doesn't go any higher. I'd give it 11/10 if I could. This is pure movie magic.Before I forget to mention it, the end credits might be the best thing about this thoroughly great film -- Benjamin Britten's 'Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra' plays while a child's voice narrates it and the credits go by in graceful, colorful script. Don't leave till you've seen every last bit. It's genius.But the movie itself -- I like Wes Anderson's work a lot but I'm still struggling with how to pin it down in words. It's eccentric charm -- absolutely every speaking role in the film is an eccentric persona -- but somehow more than that. Many or even most of the characters are fairly serious, straight-ahead personalities who don't see their own eccentricities, and when they collide with each other or with the real world is when the fun begins. That's especially true of the young preteens Suzy and Sam (newcomers Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman) around whom the plot revolves. The cast has lots of the Wes Anderson regulars like Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, Tilda Swinton, and Bruce Willis in the bigger roles. Every one of them adds to the chaotic mix that the storyline becomes.Anderson's 'Grand Budapest Hotel' (2014) followed Moonrise Kingdom a couple of years later and got more acclaim. It's great too but I don't agree. 'Hotel' is thoroughly entertaining but it's SO stylish that it kind of outweighs the human beings underneath. Moonrise Kingdom has style and charm to burn, but it also keeps its human heart at the center. You end up feeling a sense of affection for each one of them. The characters are flawed human beings worth caring for, particularly Suzy and Sam who go off together to have an adventure that at least temporarily releases them from their confining environments. They're both mildly crazy, but as the old saying goes, they click because the rocks in his head somehow perfectly fit the holes in hers.",10,1,1,30 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning of the tidal wave
","My wife and I saw this in the theater on its first release in 1977, not long after we had finished grad school. We took with us a much older friend of ours (more than a generation older in fact) who wanted to see what all the fuss was about but she was a bit too shy to go by herself. It was all great fun but of course no one in the world could have predicted the entertainment phenomenon this franchise would become. In fact, Star Wars was just a one-and-done intention until its massive popularity fueled the making of TESB. (When the opening credits of the sequel rolled starting with 'Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back', it was electrifying: everyone looked at each other saying 'What?? this is episode five? what are 1, 2, and 3?' and Lucas's grand plan was off and running. I'm not sure it would have happened though if the sequel hadn't been better than the original.)But back in 1977, we just enjoyed the straight-up simplicity and verve of the plot -- good versus evil, admittedly cardboard characters, dazzling space battles that were more fun than they had any right to be. In some sense it was fresh and dynamic, but more than anything else it played like a fond homage to the old-old Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon serials all dressed up with great SFX (which in fact our movie companion had grown up with).",8,1,1,24 April 2016
Fast Five," A loud, dumb movie
","Please please stop making these Fast and Furious movies. I'll have to start by explaining that I think auto racing is an obscenity. Why? Because it's a flagrant waste of fossil fuels for no reason except to watch big shiny loud things zooming around. So, a movie about cars racing around and smashing up in totally pointless ways ought to be a double obscenity.But I digress -- the only reason I rate this as high as 2/10 is that at least it's technically competent. It's just loud and dumb. There are some made-up bad guys and some made-up plot, but these are pretty much just a paper-thin veneer to find 'reasons' for our group of (anti)heros to race around, hide, fight, smash up lots of stuff, and generally just keep your eyes busy for 2 hours that you end up wishing you had back. Worst of all is that at the end, it's all excused with some superficial platitudes about 'family'.If all you want for the price of admission is to check your brains at the door and watch meaningless high-priced stunts with no logical connecting tissue, I guess this will fill the bill.",2,0,2,21 September 2017
Green Book," Mahershali Ali is good, and Viggo Mortensen is great. Oscar material!
","The basic storyline for this movie, a very personal look at the state of race relations in America in 1962, is all set up for penetrating drama, but one thing I didn't expect going in to the the theater last night is how funny it is. It's an Odd Couple buddy movie, and the script gives lots of chances for driver/bouncer/jack-of-all-trades Tony (played by Viggo Mortensen) to bounce off pianist virtuoso Don (Mahershala Ali) as they gradually come to understand each other's very different worlds during a two-month road trip.Ali plays a rather restrained role this time out as a famed classically trained pianist who has learned to keep his temper and maintain his dignity in the face of constant, daily insults, slights, and (at times) physically dangerous attacks simply because he's black. On concert tours we see that he keeps to himself, drinks pretty heavily at night, and is flat-out lonely. But this movie really belongs to Mortensen, who has to be the best actor around never (yet) to win an Oscar. As he has done with all of his movie roles, he completely and utterly vanishes into his character, down to the smallest gesture, details of accent, and even weight gain (to match Tony's habit of constantly eating mediocre food accompanied by chain smoking). He's an actor's actor, and I sure hope his work gets recognized this time out.The script has a pretty big cast overall, because Tony and Don meet a lot of other people on their extended tour (in addition to very entertaining occasional cuts back to Tony's extended Italo-American family in the Bronx as Tony's wife (Linda Cardeliini) reads out his letters from the road). They're all excellent. Go see this movie, you won't regret it.",9,3,8,26 November 2018
Annihilation," SF films keep extending their reach
","I see the pro critics generally like this film a lot, and it certainly does have lots of plus marks to note. It's a bit frustrating to watch in places, but it's visually striking and gets more so as it goes on, as we get further and further into the center of the mystery called The Shimmer. I also see that numerous viewers didn't like the fact that not everything is spelled out for them in the plot. This was never going to be a film that had mega-box office appeal, but that's no indicator of either its quality or its importance in the developing history of SF films. Sure enough, in the plot of Annihilation not everything is explained: some things that happen to the exploration team just -- happen. Exactly what they are after and what they are supposed to do when they reach the lighthouse at the center of the Shimmer where the unexplained phenomenon started, are never spelled out. 'How' and 'why' are not questions that are always addressed, all the way through to a somewhat ambiguous and vaguely unsettling ending, although the principal hero (Natalie Portman's role as Lena) does rather clearly succeed in triggering the Shimmer's self-destruction in the end. (With apologies to Virginia Woolf, a subtitle for the main episode inside The Shimmer could be called To The Lighthouse.)One thing I liked was the way that a major stereotype of such films was turned on its head. The team of five agents put together to go into The Shimmer is all female, played by Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tessa Thompson (almost unrecognizable here compared with her recent turn in Thor: Ragnarok), Gina Rodriguez, and Tuva Novotny. If this had been a movie from a decade or more ago, we'd have seen a team of five tough-guy Marines marching with machine guns at the ready into the misty forest of the Shimmer. But hero teams like this have changed with the times, and nowadays, it's become standard for them to have a woman or two and of course some ethnic diversity. But here? We have five *women* in fatigues marching into the misty forest, machine guns at the ready. This was very strange, and also very refreshing. Each of them is there for different reasons (in Portman's case, she is driven to find out what happened to her husband, a lone survivor from a previous team who has come back out (again, we don't find out how) in a near-catatonic state.). All of them are capable in their own ways, but because of their various personality flaws all except Lena fall victim to to what the Shimmer has to throw at them. Bottom line? Absolutely worth seeing, and a worthy new extension to the expanding range of the SF genre. It's virtually at the opposite end of the spectrum from Star Wars. Here, the setting, the ambience, and the mood are almost the main point. This is rare, but it's not an absolute newcomer to this kind of style. To me, it resembled the moody and mysterious 'Solaris' (the one from 2002 starring George Clooney, which is also worth seeing if you haven't. I admit I haven't seen the earlier classic Russian version of Solaris from 1972, which is a gap I need to correct as soon as possible.). Just settle in and let it take you along. A lot that you will see will stick in the mind.",7,0,3,18 March 2018
Incredibles 2," '... and don't fire the baby inside the house!'
","... is the funniest line in this totally entertaining sequel. That's particularly appropriate because you can make a good case that the main character (if there is one) whose story arc runs through the whole film is baby Jack-Jack, who's cheerfully and accidentally discovering his wide array of 'powers' that the rest of the Parrs have to learn to manage. The best sequence in the whole movie, I thought, was an extended dust-up between Jack-Jack and an amazingly plucky and persistent raccoon. (!) In the midst of a film built on charming homage and spoofing of superhero movies, that scene stands out as totally original. The little guy is incredibly cute (it's the eyes), and wait till you see what happens now when he sneezes.The rest of what I'll say is a bunch of my favorite bits, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, you might not want to read further -- come on back later.I give this an 8/10 because it's not deep, but it's well crafted fun from beginning to end, absolutely worth a night at the cinema. Incredibles 2 as a sequel doesn't have the advantage of being an origin story (which I generally like, unlike some viewers), but there are lots of inventive touches with the obligatory fight and chase scenes, and somewhat surprisingly the first third of the movie -- where all the setup happens -- is actually quite measured, deliberate, and (gasp!) almost adult in feel. Once you suspend disbelief to put yourself in a world where Supers exist, a lot of good questions come up. What about collateral damage to ordinary people and property, which most superhero movies (and comics) skate right past? Money problems too -- if your profession is 'superhero' and that's what you're good at, how do you make a living if that job has been outlawed? And if it's a whole family of them, how do they all get their share of the action when school, groceries, and baby care always need managing?All the Parrs and their buddy Frozone have good scenes with lots of side material. Bob learns in-the-trenches parenting. Violet goes back and forth with her targetted to-be-boyfriend Nick (who's been rehabilitated into a decent kid from the jock-in-training that he was in the original). Dash gets dad's old supercar to play with. And especially, Helen gets lots of action on her own recovering her old superheroing (superheroine-ing?) days. There are loads of other nice touches. The Parrs are given the run of an unused mansion built by 'an eccentric billionaire who wanted lots of secret entrances' (thanks, Bruce Wayne). The runaway-favorite character Edna Mold is a ringer for famous old-Hollywood fashion designer Edith Head, which fits nicely into the understated retro feel of the whole production (no one seems to be using cellphones, for example). And near the end, there's a sequence where some of our heroes are wearing luminous goggles that turn them into zombies obeying the villain's commands. They look passively out of the screen at the audience, who are in turn looking back with our 3D glasses. Weird meta moment.I like that the cartoon style of Incredibles 2 is a very close match to the original, which was an essential part of its charm. No attempts here at something glossier and more advanced like e.g. How to Train Your Dragon did with its sequel -- as the artwork becomes more 'real' it also becomes less pure fun, like comics we read as kids. Now the costumes: while Frozone has his complete body suit covering almost his whole head, the Parrs have these little black masks that don't disguise anything but nevertheless seem to work, like Clark Kent's glasses. Another fun bit is how the masks stretch and compress with their facial expressions. One improvement with the artwork is the hair (Helen gets several scenes on her high-speed motorcycle with hair blowing pretty realistically, and she has lots of closeups that are really quite expressive.) However, there's something odd that has happened in the 14 years between the original Incredibles and its sequel. Special effects and CGI in live-action superhero movies have advanced so much that the ground between them and actual cartoon/comics has almost closed. In other words, watching The Incredibles (1 or 2) doesn't feel radically different from Avengers Infinity War, which is the closest yet to replicating what happens in superhero comics. Not that this is a complaint.",8,1,2,19 June 2018
Macbeth," Stylish and atmospheric take on a classic
","This version of one of the greatest plays in the English language is worth seeing for the visuals alone. We're placed right into a medieval Scottish countryside with its strikingly beautiful landscapes, lochs, and mountains. That austere and foreboding setting underlies just about every scene. The three Weird Sisters (who look superficially like peasant women but convey a genuinely creepy otherness) stand in fog-shrouded fields as they utter their cryptic warnings and prophecies to Macbeth and lurk in the background off to the side of the battles. Hardscrabble peasants and soldiers dot the landscape, sometimes strangely motionless, sometimes lining the roads, but always enhancing an air of strangeness. Life is brutal, violent death is never far away, and the supernatural world is always just offstage.I won't worry about giving away spoilers here because this is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays, but if you haven't seen it before, then this is maybe not the best place to start. Two reasons: first, a lot of the text has been cut (even though the complete play is not that long) and it will help a lot if you already know the plot and characters. Otherwise, you might be lost not knowing who's doing what and to whom. I got the feeling that the director Justin Kurzel essentially assumes that his viewers will already know the play and are deliberately looking for a different, postmodern take on it. Second, most of the dialog is (appropriately enough) in thick Scottish accents but often almost whispered, as if the characters are speaking only to themselves or someone right beside them. In places it's hard to pick up. But this too adds to the atmosphere, as if the actors are standing outside themselves both watching and taking part.Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard make a first-rate pair of leads. David Thewlis (Duncan) and Elizabeth Debicki (Lady Macduff) are also notable, as are the three witches. The various captains and soldiers with speaking parts are hard to tell from each other, but that's another reason to know the play before going in. One added touch I thought was interesting came very early on where we see the Macbeths burying an infant daughter (who's only referred to obliquely in the play) and then losing a teenage son in battle. If they don't have their own children to live for, it maybe makes it easier to understand why they would go ahead and do what they do. Another effective touch, an interesting director's interpretation, is that Lady Macbeth slides over into madness specifically because of her husband's brutal murder of Macduff's family -- she was willing to push him into assassination as a career move but didn't bargain for what it led to, which was outright destruction even of women and children and a reign of blood. 'What's done cannot be undone.'See the full play in a live theater, somewhere, and then see this movie for its distinctive ambience. It's an added-value experience.",7,1,2,13 July 2018
