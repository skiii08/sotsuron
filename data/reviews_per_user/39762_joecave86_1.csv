Hereditary," I wanted to walk out
","This film is quite painful and uncomfortable...but not in a scary way.
It tries to be like many other great horrors wicker man,shinning,exorcist but it fails.
The main actress is great,but she is the only great thing about this film,everything else failed to entertain me...or scare me.
I genuinely wanted to walk out about halfway through and I wish I did...not worth a cinema visit...maybe worthy of Netflix in a few years if your are really bored and have nothing else to do.",4,1,3,22 June 2018
