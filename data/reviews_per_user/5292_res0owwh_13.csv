Vertigo," Overly melodramatic and just another murder mystery.
","Possible Spoiler(s).I recently viewed this film as an adult, having once seen it as a child and not having remembered much about it.I usually endeavour to stay in a positive mode of thinking, but that is difficult for me to accomplish regarding this movie.The movie illustrates dishonesty, obsessive/compulsive disorders, mental illness(es), sadomasochism, greed, and control.Additionally, it is seriously dated and indicative of the closed-mindedness of the era in which it was created.I gave it a 6 out of 10 and that was pushing it.",6,4,10,3 January 2002
12 Monkeys," Excellent movie which accurately depicts alternate existences and states of consciousness.
","There exists a body of scientific evidence that believes/knows that schizophrenia is not a disease, merely an altered state or states of consciousness.  Schizophrenic individuals are termed in some circles as being multi-dimensional in consciousness and/or inter-dimensional in consciousness.  This movie does a better than excellent job of illustrating those facts/theories.Select quantum mechanics physics theories also support the above data.  Life is much more complex than we, as human beings, originally gave it credit for.This movie also deals with some philosophical revelatory data going back in time aeons.Excellent work on the part of the entire cast and crew involved. Classification for some, 'teaching movie' or 'fiction with a purpose'.",10,0,0,3 January 2002
The Others," The Others (2001) accurately depicts the existence of alternate existences.
","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Not unlike the Sixth Sense starring Bruce Willis, this movie illustrates the existence of alternate existences or parallel universes/worlds/dimensions colliding and infringing upon each other.Nicole Kidman's part is one in which she remained in denial of her own death (change in dimension), until proven otherwise by those in that dimension.To fully understand the concepts illustrated therein, it is usually necessary to understand quantum physicists who believe in alternate realities/universes/worlds/dimensions, etc., or to have actually experienced same.The movie is much appreciated for going out on a limb in that respect and is also considered 'fiction with a purpose' since it teaches truths to those who are ready and/or willing to accept truths.  Otherwise, it's just another scary movie containing a lot of darkness and fear.Aside from quantum physicists' theories in re parallel universes, etc., there are some spiritual references to alternate realities, as well.  One being from the teacher Jesus, his statement, 'In my Father's house there are many mansions'.",9,0,0,21 November 2001
L.A. Confidential," L.A. Confidential (1997) is an excellent illustration of the need to fight fire with fire.
","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN.This movie portrays matrixes within matrixes within matrixes, or games within games within games, etc. and illustrates the intense efforts necessary to arrive at the center of the maze.Deception, corruption, and dishonesty are everywhere but fortunately there are some who will go to any length to undue the ball of string.Once exposed, it takes evil to fight evil, with care taken to not become evil in the process.  To quote Christopher Lambert in Beowulf, 'The only thing that keeps me from becoming evil is fighting evil' and Nicolas Cage in re 8MM, 'One needs to be careful when fighting monsters that they don't become a monster'.This movie portrays in an exceptional manner the forces than can be behind crime and murder and those forces' quests for power and greed. Additionally, it takes one from the nieve state of mind of the young cop (Guy Pearce) to the reality of the world we live in; a maturation process. It also illustrates the driving forces behind human behaviour, i.e., Russell Crowe's character's war against men who abuse women and how his fear and loathing of those characteristics results in his becoming what he feared and loathed in one scene.Overall, an exceptional and informative movie about human nature with as good an ending as can be expected under the circumstances.",10,1,2,25 November 2001
American Psycho," American Psycho (2000) is an enlightening film encompassing and requiring philosophy, esotericism, and quantum mechanics physics for complete understanding.
","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN.During the first 75% of this movie I found myself bored, irritated and judgmental toward the main character.  It was not until the last quarter of the movie when the interesting twists started occurring that it actually arrested my attention.The main character's, Patrick Bateman, behaviours would be classified by medical science as psychopathic and/or sociopathic in nature, or as being mentally insane.  Whereas, most psychopaths have or appear to have no conscience, Mr. Bateman did possess some conscientiousness, at least toward the latter part of the movie.Bateman experienced at least one consciousness dimensional shift as a result of the 'black hole' effect he was experiencing in his consciousness/mind. That shift indicated by the facts that his attorney did not recognize him as Bateman but as Davis, the attorney's knowledge that Paul Allen was alive in his (the attorney's) reality, the apartment where Allen had resided and which was then under remodeling, the real estate representative's apparent knowledge of more than one existence/dimension evidenced by her statements to Bateman wherein she requested him to cause no trouble, to leave, and to not return.Mr. Bateman wanted, needed, and attempted to get help for his dilemma evidenced by his statement to his secretary on the telephone, 'I need help Jean, I don't think I'm going to make it' to which she essentially ignored until later and his statement to his girlfriend, 'I need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale.  It cannot be corrected but I have no other way to fulfill my needs', to which she also ignored as well as ignoring the drawing he was making at the dining table in the restaurant. The poor fellow was surrounded by egomaniacs who were totally engrossed in themselves only.Patrick Bateman's statements at the very ending of the movie illustrate his confusion, frustration, and lack of knowledge concerning the reality(ies) he found himself in.This is a movie which deals with immortality, infinity, free will, and a host of other esoteric-related philosophies, as well as some quantum mechanics physics' theories.Under the circumstances, it was impossible for me to not feel human compassion for this gentleman who found himself in a loop in hell with no obvious way out, to his present knowledge.",9,0,1,26 November 2001
American Beauty," American Beauty (1999) represents an excellent illustration of the real reality, self-honesty, and freedom of the soul/spirit.
","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILER!This movie is a Godsend.  It deals with one man's search for and location of himself, that having a paradoxically positive effect on others thereby nudging them along to enter the same pathway, if they choose.It likewise reveals the overwhelming states of denial, obsession with materialism, control-freak individuals, tyrants and abusive-type individuals that exist in our current world.Overall, it is a 110% positive movie, illustrating honesty, nobility, respect, and freedom of the mind, soul, and body.Physical death is just a change in dimension for consciousness, as was illustrated by Kevin Spacey's character's comments at the end of the movie. This is a 'Know Thyself' movie. It is 'fiction with a purpose' - it teaches freedom and the real reality.",10,0,0,24 November 2001
The Usual Suspects," A great movie that requires intense concentration, attentiveness, and open-mindedness.
","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILER!  Please read no further if you are still in the mystery. The solution to The Usual Suspects is up to the audience as far as determination of who is what and who. Key questions and statements:  'Who is Keyser Soze?'  'You never knew, that was his power.'  'The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.'  'One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.' 'There was a group of Hungarians that wanted their own mob.  They realized that to be in power you didn't need guns, or money, or even numbers, you just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.'  'Soze looks over the faces of his family then he shows those men a will, what WILL really was.'  'He tells them he would rather see his family dead than live another day after this.'  'No one ever really believes.'  'Keaton always said, 'I don't believe in God but I'm afraid of him'.  'I believe in God and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.' Roger 'Verbal' Kint was Keyser Soze a/k/a The Devil.  Evidence: conversation between the cop and the special agent regarding Verbal's immunity, 'This whole thing has turned political.  This guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness, take my word for it'; picture faxed to NYPD given as part of the testimony of the burn victim; the burn victim's testimony that he thinks they were buying people, not dope (souls being called in by the one to whom they owed and/or had allegiance), that he saw the Devil, looked him in the eye.  'Who's the Devil?' he was asked and he responded, 'Keyser Soze, he was in the harbor killing many men' and stated that he saw his face.  Verbal's statement regarding the line-up, 'Besides it was fun, I got to make like I was notorious'; Verbal's shape-shifting at the end of the movie (limp removed and hand straightened out). Verbal ad-libbed much of his testimony to the special agent based on data he read off of the office wall bulletin board and from the bottom of a coffee cup, i.e., alias Redfoot, Kobayashi (there was a real being but his real name probably wasn't Kobayashi), Guatamala, Quartet - Skokie, Illinois, 'orca-fat guy', etc.  What really happened during those six weeks is anybody's guess but the fact remains that they did show up at the boat and attempt to destroy non-existent cocaine, kill and be killed 27 people, and attempt to collect 91 million dollars.  Verbal killed all three of his accomplices, note the statement by McManus, 'Strangest thing'. The special agent lacked imagination and operated like any other cop, i.e., 'To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated, it's always simple. There no mystery to the street, no archcriminal behind it all.  If you've got a dead body and you think his brother did it, you're going to find out you're right.' A brilliant script.  'The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.'",10,0,1,20 November 2001
The Game," The Game illustrates the theory or truth, depending on ones' viewpoint, that life is just a game ('All of life is a stage and we are but the actors' - William Shakespeare).
","From a spiritual and/or philosophical viewpoint, The Game illustrates many truths, more truths than untruths.  Therefore, it can be classified as a 'teaching movie', meaning that it illustrates truths which already existed prior to its production.  Or, stated another way, it is fiction with a purpose.It deals with the breaking down of the human ego in order to locate truth. The main character was not seeking truth, therefore, it was his time or his destiny/fate, spiritually and philosophically speaking.From a religious/spiritual standpoint, John 9:25 was cited within the movie, 'Whereas once I was blind, now I can see'.  Like the movie 'The Matrix', the main character is working with what can be considered a spiritual team, headed by what can be considered an Angel of Death.  At the end of the movie Nicholas asks Claire if she is off to sheer some more sheep.  She replies that 'It's just a walk-on this time', meaning that his (Nicholas') induction into reality was a 'drag-on' as opposed to a 'walk on'.  His number was up, so to speak.The main reason that his number was up was due to his intense fear regarding his father's suicide at age 48, which is the age Nicholas finds himself at in the beginning of the movie and the fact that he might be destined to follow in his father's footsteps, or cursed in that respect, if one believes in curses.  Nicholas' other fears were addressed also.  Regarding fear itself, there is a passage in the Christian Bible by one of the prophets which states, 'What I have feared the most has come upon me'. Metaphysically, fear begets fear or like attracts like.  Another good reason to confront fears and walk through them before they walk through us.Nicholas died at least once in the movie (woke up in a grave in Mexico and received a T-shirt stating that fact, later, from his brother).There are several consciousness dimensional shifts illustrated in the movie, the first being as Michael Douglas as Nicholas entered the airport to travel to Armin Mueller-Stahl's character's location to fire him.The movie depicts Nicholas' humbling process in an excellent manner, focusing on his manipulation and control tendencies and his self-centered advanced state of egocentricity as well as his fears.The movie additionally depicts and confirms immortality of the human spirit as well as alternate realities, worlds, universes, existences.",10,0,3,20 November 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Eyes Wide Shut (1999) contains and illustrates esoteric knowledge.
","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILER!The movie is working with some quantum physicists' theories and spiritual/philosophical truths.It contains numerous dimensional shifts, the most profound dimensional shift being Cruise's character's ability to walk into his wife's dream reality, while still in his ordinary, waking 3-D reality (existence in a minimum of two dimensions simultaneously).  His ability to do so was due to the fact that he was suffering immensely regarding his wife's admission to him that she had been attracted to another man; his obsession therewith resulting in a 'Dark Night of the Soul' type experience.The ending deals with the couples' realization of immortality.  Excellent movie classified as 'fiction with a purpose'; it illustrates some truths.",Null,0,0,21 November 2001
Pulp Fiction," 'The Truth is you're the weak and I'm the tyranny of evil men. But, I'm trying Ringo, I'm trying real hard to be the shepherd.'
","POSSIBLE SPOILER(S).Pulp Fiction (1994) is predominantly about one man's awakening/enlightenment. It is a beautifully illustrated movie about specific types of lifestyles.The entire cast and crew create an excellent production of real life situations for some people.  It's honesty and ability to be aboveboard are much appreciated and much needed by our current society/world.Interwoven amongst the violence and betrayal are dedication, love, morality, loyalty, immortality, and spirituality.  To make it even more interesting is the fact that it ignores the time-space continuum, which many of us know is an illusion relevant to the ordinary 3-D reality only, and illustrates the real reality of existence.It is classified as 'fiction with a purpose' - it teaches and instructs if we will pay attention and paying close attention is mandatory for understanding of the messages that are contained within this movie.pulp:  1. a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter.  2. A magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.  American Heritage Dictionary, New College Edition.A splendid work of art, science, and esotericism.",10,1,2,17 December 2001
Blow," Accurate depiction of one of the manners in which an individual or individuals an become addicts and/or alcoholics.
","Possible Spoiler(s)Blow is based on the true life story of George Jung, as told by George Jung (from his perception).Being fed-up and disillusioned with the lifestyles of his parents, he progressively got into drugs and drug dealing at a relatively young age.He likewise was made painfully aware of the betrayal, dishonesty, distrust, and general lack of honour which are natural parts of that lifestyle and/or field(s) of endeavour.The story line depicts the insanity, pain, misery, suffering, and consequences involved in such endeavours.The entire cast and crew are to be commended for an excellent job of telling/showing this gentleman's story, as he sees it.",8,0,0,26 January 2002
Trainspotting," Trainspotting (1996) accurately depicts the trials and tribulations of heroin addiction and likewise in varying degrees of all types of addiction.
","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN.This movie is commendable, if nothing else, for its honesty.It depicts a recovering heroin addicted individual's sincere attempt to maintain his old friendships, after he had changed himself.  Like attracts like, therefore, when one changes, like will then be attracting dislike, or its opposite, until it likewise makes adjustments therein.As the main character's female friend advised him, 'You've got to find something new', he partially did so, but failed to cut all of the strings, resulting in more addictive-like behaviours and his submission to his conditional friend (the friend's conditions) allowing himself, his life, and his home to be victimized.A key phrase in the movie was made by the star, 'For the first time in my idle life, I was almost content'.  Some valid theories on addiction are that addicts come into the world in a state of restlessness, irritability, and discontent.The movie closes on a positive note with the main character's statements: 'The truth is I am a bad person.  But that's going to change.  I'm going to change.  This is the last of that sort of thing.  I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on; going straight and choosing life'.An overall positive movie illustrating the difficulties some individuals have with acceptance of life in the everyday, ordinary 3-D reality.",9,0,2,25 November 2001
The Matrix," The Matrix is a spiritual movie, based upon spirituality, not necessarily religion.
","The Matrix does a better than excellent job of illustrating spiritual truths (not religious truths, necessarily, although some religious philosophies are illustrated therein, i.e., Luke 1:37 'For with God nothing shall be impossible'.)  The crew on-board the Nebuchadnezzar can be considered a spiritual team.  The agents can be considered demons, the neophyte's own demons which he must overcome in order to transcend the ordinary 3-D reality.  The agents present to the neophyte his fears, doubts, and disbeliefs which he must fight against and win in order to fully know himself.Additionally, the movie depicts planetary control and the majority of human beings' unconsciousness in that regard ('Billions of people just walking around oblivious.')The members of the spiritual team act as teachers, as well as the agents. Both teams are considered teachers.  Agent Smith spills a lot of truths. One team operates from a positive viewpoint and the other from a negative viewpoint.Overall, the movie will open one's eyes, if one is looking for the opening. 'Seek and you will find.'  Otherwise, the movie is just another science fiction flick filled with formula (thrills, chills, trauma, drama, and theatrics).",10,3,6,20 November 2001
