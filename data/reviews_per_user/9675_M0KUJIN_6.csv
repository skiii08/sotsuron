Alien 3," Serial Killer's, Child Rapists...and Sex Starved Fundamentalist's....help Ripley (kinda)
","1992, and 20th Century Fox gave the world ALIEN³. For the director's chair, Fox hired silver screen virgin -- David Fincher; who was at the peak of a successful career directing music videos and television commercials, while also having worked at George Lucas' ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) during the 80's.The tale of ALIEN³ takes place on one of the most inhospitable environments (asides from Los Angeles) ever portrayed on film. Human criminals and an Alien scream away at each other in the cinematic equivalent of 'Hillary Clinton Vs. Condaleeza Rice' in a Bangkok backstreet prostitute fight. The location is Fury 161, an evacuated lead mine and prison colony with only a fraction of it's original population wishing to voluntarily remain of they're own accord. There, some of society's most wretched and vile convicts have been isolated; murderers, child rapists, serial killers and loons have formed a sort of monastic order, living in the lead mining facilities. The prisoners (logically) have no weapons, no escape vehicle, no booze, no pornography, no TV, no internet access, no HBO and to make matters even worse, are all inclined to regularly shave their head and body hair, as the planet is infested with 'future' lice. On this delightful planet arrives Lt. Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), the future equivalent of Typhoid Mary.No sooner has Ripley shaved, deaths immediately begin occurring throughout Fury 161 with a rather suspicious Xenomorphic air about them . Realizing what she may have inadvertently brought Fury's unsuspecting residents from her visit to LV-426, Lt. Ellen Ripley goes about doing what must be done in order to save Fury's quickly dwindling prison population, and perhaps - humanity itself.From this point onwards, the rest of the film is spent franticly running around, strenuously arguing, overly screaming and weeping through the depressing Fury 161 facility, while awaiting Bishop II (played by Lance Henriksen) to arrive to make his (gimmick) guest appearance.On a more serious note, the plot does takes time to advance. The first half of the film is short on action, BIG on character introduction, development, tension and suspense. The thought of having weapons taken away adds even more to the terror as the theme goes into that of vulnerability/helplessness/defenseless. The power structure is reversed and the frustration is evident, and seeing how a group of prisoners, who's crimes are based on those of assumed power, deals with it is a very strong concept. Without the sympathy for Ripley from the previous ALIEN movies and only minor flashes of humanity from the prisoners themselves, the film is without sympathetic characters worthy of redemption. A truly wonderful change from the traditional film status-quo B.S..Asides the undeserving criticism the film received on it's debut, ALIEN³'s superb intermixed UK & US cast, cinematography, excellent production values, beautiful art direction, flawless editing, menacing score, visually stunning set designs and not forgetting of course - skillful directing; make this an underrated masterpiece, that continues to find itself in greater appreciation in a modern day sea of mediocre Hollywood productions. Despite the constant high level daily studio interference throughout the troubled production of ALIEN³ (back in 1991), Finchers directorial (debut) brilliance continues to shine throughout ALIEN³ in the above noted departments. All in all, this movie is a worthy conclusion to the ALIEN trilogy. It's my personal favorite in the series due to the multiple themes and concepts presented. Brilliantly acted and directed, and the prison/Gothic industrial setting is haunting and eerily beautiful.ALIEN³ is akin to a fine wine; it matures with age.An underrated if somewhat misunderstood masterpiece.",8,119,191,27 April 2005
Unbreakable," Unpalatable. Unbearable. Un-everything.....
","I viewed UNBREAKABLE on the recommendation of a friend.STUPID.The movie was tedious from beginning to end. An exercise in ULTIMATE patience, which even the Dalai Lama would ultimately fail.The movie starts off with the birth of a baby boy named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) but taking a closer look at him his arms and legs are broken for some reason, and through out life he gets the name Mr. Glass because he breaks easily. Fast forwarding to the present an unhappy married security guard named David (Bruce Willis) discovers that he is the sole survivor in a train crash and surprised he doesn't have a scratch on him, but when Elijah discovers David he is drawn to him, whilst David doesn't seem to be interested in what he is capable of. Seeing how the two are the opposite of each other Elijah talks about heroes, villains and comic books trying to..........Y'know what? F*CK IT! I cannot be ass'd explaining the shitty non-existent plot. The story starts off 'old man' slow, gets even slower and then just slips into a coma.This movie is not worth renting, or even watching for F-R-E-E. I am totally serious. I didn't begin to write this review/opinion piece just to bring down the movie's rating but to inform the level-headed individuals of the world, as to how much of a steaming pile of elderly woman's turd UNBREAKABLE genuinely is.Its a total excremental mess from the get go. The kind of movie you are glad not to have spent money about, but regret wasting your time with. I wonder how many people came out of a movie theater literally swearing about this ridiculously slow, inconclusive, mass of nonsense. It's rare to see a film that has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all, but UNBREAKABLE achieves this with EASE.Congrats Shyamalan.Rant OUT!",1,4,10,24 July 2006
Scary Movie 2," Expulsion of seminal fluid from the urethra of the penis during orgasm....this movie ain't.
","'No mercy. No shame. No sequel.' If only those two groups of brothers--Wayans and Weinstein--had heeded the last part of that tag-line for the original Scary Movie.Scary Movie 2 is an all new low in modern comedic cinema. Anna Faris's only talent is making men mass-ejaculate. Shawn Wayans is homosexual. Marlon Wayans is a pot-head. Tori Spelling performs fellatio on a ghost, and Christopher Masterson does zip. Yes ladies and gentleman, these are their main character traits.For a supposed comedy, the film fails on every single level.It's quite ironic, because in the first movie, the Wayans brothers wanted to not only parody horror movies but also the countless teen movies that have recently come into existence since the mid 90's. Now, they too, have befallen the same trap that they once set out to destroy through comedy -- they're coming up with half-brain ideas, full of young actors, making a comedy movie simply because they can and in the foolish belief (although at least 60% of the time it's not financially foolish) it will sell lots of tickets/DVD's. Face it, the Wayans brothers have become what they most feared -- cheap writers making teen movies for the mere purpose to make a few bucks.More power to them  but sellouts nonetheless.83 minutes too long. Avoid.",1,9,22,16 October 2005
Mission: Impossible II," 'Squeeze a Child by It's throat.'
","Devoid of any sense at all, this movie does its best to insult the intelligence of any living human whom views it. It's the type of movie that leaves a 12 year old orgasmicly gasping, while leaving any rationally level headed individual with a deep sense of the 'MISSING TIME' phenomenon.The original 1996 'Mission: Impossible' movie showed just how an intelligent (while yet entertaining) espionage movie could be made, without a single gun battle, although with several good break-ins and chase scenes. The 1996 'Mission: Impossible' was about sabotage, agents, betrayals, heists, set-ups, shake downs and the mission. The plot was intricate and intelligent. It had twist's and turns. The conclusion was great, the ending was great, and the climax was intense. By contrast in this sequel, probably the only people in the world whose heads move fast enough to plan maneuvers like the ones CROOZE improvises in this film are the scriptwriters. Let me speak to some of the far more child-like idiotic elements of this movie that just left me completely embarrassed, and certainly anything BUT impressed.In an action sequence, in which a lone Tom Cruise is gunfighting with the villains at a biotechnology compound, the bad guys happen to be perched underneath some barrels labeled - 'DANGEROUS, HAZARDOUS / MEDICAL WASTE'. So what does our innovative Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) decide to do? He shoots out the barrels and 'KA-BOOM!' they explode, eliminating the evildoers in a single engulfing explosion.Now what exactly do movie producers believe constitutes medical waste? C4 explosive? Napalm? How does a barrel full of petri-dishes, used diapers, test tubes, dirty syringes, tainted glassware etc, etc, all of the sudden become an explosive weapon of mass destruction, that takes out a fortified enemy position? If so, can we please kill two birds with one stone and just drop hospital medical waste barrels from B52's in George W. Bush's foreshadowing war against either North Korea or Iran, and save our tax dollars? There are numerous other inane parts but the above example is illustrative of the movie's approach which is -- F-CK any form of a plot, believability and any form of common sense - full speed ahead on CROOZE appeal and CROOZE facial close-ups with flowing of hair!!!If you can deal with pointless dialog and non-existent storyline enough to appreciate some CROOZE action sequences and constant CROOZE scenery, and more slow-motion than can be found in the complete catalog of John Madden's Football Highlights Specials, this might be for you.Otherwise save your time, do something more constructive, such as surfing the net for.....'STUFF'.",1,21,42,4 February 2006
War of the Worlds," Re-make No.1,781,691.........
","Stop me if you've heard this one before: The Earth has been overrun with Aliens with little to no motivation beyond the complete extermination of the Human race. Well, that's the PLOT outta the way.The acting?Well, Tom Cruise (CHECK!) plays Tom Cruise (CHECK!), in a Tom Cruise movie (CHECK!). No big shock there.As for Dakota Fanning, I really wanted to put a 'KILL ME FIRST' sign on her. She spends the entire movie S-C-R-E-A-M-I-N-G. She screams at her father, she screams at her brother, she screams at the Aliens, she screams when she's reunited with her mother. And when there is a lapse in the movie (and there are many) she screams as a filler. Does she even talk in normal decibels?When was the last time you saw refugees running TOWARD an ensuing battle? Well, Ray's teenage asshole son is inexplicably caught up in the patriotic rush to destruction along with a lot of other unknown dead-from-the-neck-up civilians. We're also faced with refugees streaming out of one large alien-ravaged city (NEW JERSEY) only to stream into another alien-ravaged city (BOSTON). Go figure.Meanwhile, the aliens for reasons unknown, have taken to invading the rural areas at a concentration of one Tripod per acre. While on their coffee break from all the HARD HARD work, the aliens find the cellar of an old farmhouse fascinating. Then, when the steam whistle blows, it's back to work snaring/drinking/eating/vaporizing humans.As for a nice happy-happy ending, Mom and her family are safe and sound in their untouched upper-class Boston neighborhood (they appear dressed for an imminent 'War of the Worlds' party.) I guess War of the Worlds rounds-off Spielberg's - 'New Millennium SCI-FI Turkey Trilogy'...A.I., Minority Report, and now this utter sh*t-fest.War of the Worlds (2005) - takes more minutes off your life than smoking.Trust me........AVOID.",1,2,5,28 May 2006
Signs," Passion of the Aliens
","Mel Gibson plays a rural Pennsilvaniya farmer. A rural Pennsilvaniya farmer who doesn't do a single second of farming during the entire movie.It gets worse.Mel's mundane celibate existence is rudely interrupted when 7 foot furry green aliens, who fart at the wrists, decide to invade the planet...but more specifically, have set their nefarious EXTRA TERRESTRIAL sights on seeking 'THAT' global strategic position that every nation on Earth is vying for...yup, that's right...RURAL 'P-e-n-n-s-i-l-v-a-n-i-y-a'. (sarcasm laden heavy sigh~~~~~~) However these are no ordinary aliens. No sir! They've managed to travel billions of light-years through space, only to be stymied by the uber-complex technology of boards and nails that Mel has erected around his home.Yes, a race of beings for whom water is as caustic as INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH ACID select as the target of their invasion a planet whose surface is no less than 70% covered by water, inhabited by beings whose bodies contain more than 90% water.(Just how did they traverse through Mel's dew laden cornfields at night without being burned to a f**king crisp?!?!?) The humans are no Einsteins either, the radio communications used by the aliens, easily picked up by a common baby monitor, somehow escape the higher tech scrutiny that you'd expect from the scientific community or the military. And where is the military? At no time are there big explosions from the usual response to a threat, oh, say invisible hostile alien spaceships hovering over major cities all around the world.Nope, it's a 'wait and see' approach here (maybe they were praying for rain). And what were the aliens going to do with the planet or us after we'd been conquered? A planet covered mostly by water,which is hardly an ideal vacation paradise for them is it? Perhaps they were going to tow it away and Ebay it. I dunno....and neither does M. Night Shymalan I bet.Furthermore, keep in mind that human beings are made of mostly water, so these invaders can't exactly devour us, nor can they enjoy the pleasures of sex with us. So maybe they'll burn us as fuel. Or Ebay us. Given these aliens observed level of technical sophistication, you could suppose their spaceships might have been of the steam powered variety.Of course, the Shymalan-fans-deep-in-denial are going to come back with howls of outrage that I 'DON'T GET IT!'. I can hear them now... 'Dumbass! It's not about sci-fi or horror, it's about family, faith and spirituality!'.Nah....It's a pathetically crap drawn-out hack written / directed drama pretending to be Sci-Fi. Both this movies alien attack plot and themes of faith and religion fall apart under the slightest bit of scrutiny (and I ain't even trying). SIGNS is another overly self important film by the most overrated HACKS of his time. Shyamalan fanatics and apologists will eat it up like excrement, while normal folks will retch violently and then upchuck.Oh, did I happen to mention that the aliens fart at the wrists?",1,15,33,19 June 2006
