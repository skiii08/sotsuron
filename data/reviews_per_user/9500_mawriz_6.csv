Skyfall," Massively Overrated
","I feel this film is massively overrated. The overly long gun fights couldn't distract me from the shallow revenge plot. We find out very early on that the agent's list(already used in Mission Impossible) was just a distraction to the main plan which is to take revenge on M. This tiny little story is wrapped up in a sushi of gun fights, chase scenes, explosions, trains, helicopters, etc. And that's the ENTIRE film.A few specific qualms: 1. Completely incompetent bad guy. This film will dazzle us with all his cyber terrorism skills and techy stuff but it all comes down to the fact that he had THREE chances to kill either M or James Bond and he failed due to the old 'take your time before killing someone'.2. Bond arranges a face to face meeting with the bad guy. That's your plan Mr. Bond? A man of your experience and you go with let's get handcuffed and bring a tracking device? Which by the way none of the goons checked his pockets?3. Villain's elaborate but pointless plan. So you get captured intentionally to hack MI6, what exactly did that do for you? You could have went to the hearing without doing that. By the way, didn't you already hack MI6 at the beginning of the film?4. Magic bread crumb trails. What exactly is it and why can only the villain see it and not MI6?",Null,5,11,11 March 2013

Citizen Kane," Not the greatest movie ever made
","I had my phase of being a pretentious elitist armchair film critic but that's over now, I've grown out of it. Back then I would have given this film 10 stars and agree blindly with the snobs that this is the greatest movie ever made. But not today, today I will be honest with myself.The story is not engaging. There have been other movies since with similar arcs that do a better job. Same with the use of the MacGuffin. Some of the acting is poor. The pacing is too slow. And before anyone says I was predisposed to hate old movies, I actually loved Casablanca.This isn't a terrible movie by all means, it's just mediocre. I would never recommend it to any of my friends, unless the have insomnia. I just had to get this one out of the way for my bucket list.",Null,1,5,29 January 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," This movie is 100 times better than Force Awakens
","This movie is 100 times better than Force Awakens. I'm kinda glad JJ Abrams isn't directing Episode 8. This one is actually trying to be a real movie, the other one is trying to be a blockbuster, a montage of cool scenes. The story hooks you and you can't let go. The characters felt real and you connect with them at an emotional level. The dialogue is sharp and fits the rest of the movie.The war scenes felt like Saving Private Ryan. I love that they had the balls to kill off everyone. If I had one criticism, it's that Act 1 took too long to connect the strings together. It felt little disjointed at the start. But once they did, they took you to one hell of a ride. This is the real Star Wars movie for me.",Null,2,6,17 December 2016
The Prestige," Formulaic, contrived, predictable
","I don't know how any movie buff would not see the twists coming from a mile away. One can see when a twist is done in a tasteful and careful manner, and when the film makers are desperately trying to fit square pegs into round holes. Credit must be given to Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, and David Bowie for their superb acting. However Christian Bale(who I normally like) and Scarlett Johansson were terrible. A few of my specific gripes: 1. The ending is given away in the first minute. Christian Bale is accused of killing Hugh Jackman. EVERY MOVIE that starts with this presentation ends up with the supposedly accused being innocent.2. The cat was duplicated. Surely by this alone anyone can deduce that Jackman was also duplicated. Hence the pointless 'solving the puzzle' scenes.3. Mystery/suspense turned into Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories science fiction halfway through the movie.4. Jackman conveniently tears up the Transported Man secret(which was a driving plot) so he can be shot by Bale's twin brother.5. Jackman conveniently finds an exact look-alike in a bar.6. Bale's wife amazingly knows which days he loves her and which he doesn't, in a dire attempt to connect the twin brother twist.7. I was terribly disappointed with Perabo's death scene and subsequent funeral. These were two important moments in the film and should have been emphasized and given more attention. 'What knot did you tie?'. 'I don't know'. 'You don't know?'.8. A supposedly 'dead' Jackman trots in public without any concern of being recognized to have a contrived face to face dramatic effect with his nemesis.9. Just get a gun and shoot each other in the back. The movie would be over in 10 minutes and there would be no need for tantalizing sabotages.To conclude, this movie was made with the intention of 'let's get in as many twists and turns possible' rather than 'let's tell a good story with a twist'.",Null,29,56,6 April 2013
Prometheus," Just another hack and slash film nothing more
","This is just another hack and slash film. This is not an exploration of the origins of man. Basically, when they meet 'The Engineer', the one that they have been searching for all this time, he just smashed them to bits.It's also hard to believe that this crew just hopped on a ship and travel that distance without knowing exactly what they're supposed to be doing or where they're going.How can Shaw still believe in Jesus Christ (along with God the Father and the Holy Spirit because they are supposed to be treated as one) after it has just been proved that he is not the creator and therefore not God? I know one of the themes is belief vs. knowledge but this was not done very well. How would we treat someone today who still believes that the world is flat after it has been proved incorrect by solid facts? I thought Charlize Theron would have a significant impact on the plot but it turns out she is just the typical heir apparent who cannot wait to take over.When the cast doesn't have personality, character build up, or background story it's hard to care when they get obliterated.",Null,3,4,1 January 2013
