Airlift," Thrilling. Exciting. Edge of the seat!
",It was a great movie and good acting by Akshay Kumar. The script was well written. The movie never felt like a drag. You were always on the edge of your seat.The suspense and tension was built up in such a way that during some scenes you thought 'Now something bad is gonna happen' and you were gripping your seat! The overall acting by the entire cast was spot on except the Iraqi general. He was trying too hard with the accent and it looked out of place.Overall a great movie! A must Watch!,8,0,1,9 February 2016
