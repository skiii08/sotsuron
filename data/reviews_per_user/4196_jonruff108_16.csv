Requiem for a Dream," The most disturbing and depressing movie I've ever seen.
","FYI: I watched the original, NC-17 version.There's no doubt this movie has been reviewed by thousands of other people here on IMDb so it seems rather pointless to add another but I still feel inclined to share my thoughts and feelings of this fantastic movie.I didn't know what to expect going in. I hardly had a clue what it really was about other than that it involved drugs and, one of my favorite actors, Jared Leto. While it is quite possibly the hardest movie I've watched, it is also one of the best directed, acted, and edited.The first half of the movie is more interesting than anything else. The characters and their motivations are unfolded slowly and the quick and clean editing and cinematography keeps the audience completely engaged. There are some really neat camera tricks that are actually quite creative and bring the character's perspectives closer to you.The second half of the movie is where things start to unravel more quickly and violently. Characters become more desperate and are willing to go to any lengths to get what they want, and, in effect, the on screen images slowly become more disturbing and gut-wrenching to watch. There were multiple times when I was unknowingly squirming in my chair in disgust at the horrors on screen.The real reasons these images are so intensely horrifying are because of the motivations the characters have. It all comes down to the basic idea of what is happening. The thematic elements are just as frightening as the visual elements. Maybe not everyone will be affected in such an intense way; it depends on how much you can stomach.But maybe perhaps the reason both the thematic and the visual elements worked so blissfully together was because of the incredible acting from the entire cast. Ellen Burstyn delivers a phenomenal performance as the challenged mother of Harry (Leto) and depicts insanity that is so believable you forget she's acting. She totally deserved her Oscar nomination. Jared Leto was his usual self, putting everything he had into the performance and pouring emotion onto the screen everywhere. Jennifer Connelly also gives an excellent performance as Harry's psychologically tortured love interest. Again, it was very easy to forget that you were watching actors and actresses act and think you're actually seeing these deeply troubled people through the eyes of a camera.Then, of course, there's the soundtrack. Oh, boy...has it become popular fourteen years later. It's an odd soundtrack for this type of movie. It's more 'epic' sounding and inspiring if heard by itself but when it's put into the movie it becomes something else entirely. it's eerie, it's scary, and most of all, it adds to the intensity of what's happening on screen in a strange but subtle way. Clint Mansell did an excellent job making this possible.I really never thought a movie about drugs could possibly be so fascinating and interesting. Darren Aronofsky directs in such a way that everything is personal between the characters and the audience. You care for these people; you feel like you know them. You want them to overcome their troubles. The camera merely serves as a window into their world. You feel a part of it all.Would I recommend this movie? Well, it would depend on the person. There haven't been many movies that have moved me in a way this one did. It wasn't the typical emotional experience but rather a truly gut-wrenching one. There is no hope, no savior, no happiness. By the time the credits roll you should feel dead inside. This is one of those movies that everyone should watch at some point during their lives, preferably when they're younger. But for that very reason, it doesn't make it a film for everyone.",9,1,2,8 August 2014
Gravity," One of the Best Movies of the Year and Possibly One of the Greatest of all time.
","This is my first review for this site so just bear with me, please.'Gravity' is, with almost no doubt, the best movie of the year. (Keep in mind I have not seen '12 Years a Slave' yet but I have seen 'Captian Philips' which was astonishing and brilliant in so many ways, but didn't reach the same heights as 'Gravity'). If there is ever to be a near perfect movie to be made, this is it. Everything from the acting to the visual effects is top- notch and of the highest quality. The visual effects, being the standout here, are so spectacular that many may wonder, including myself, how this wasn't actually filmed in space. The attention to the tiniest of the tiniest of detail is amazing. Every single texture, every thread sewn into their clothes, every particle of the dust floating around in the space crafts, every ray of light emitting from the sun and bouncing off the metallic objects is 100% believable. There wasn't a single moment throughout the 90 minute running time that I didn't believe what I was seeing on the screen. If you are one of the many people who get annoyed with over the top special effects (like me), this movie will be the exception. That also goes for 3D and IMAX. I hate 3D. HATE it. This movie made me realize the potential 3D has for movies in the future. It added a certain depth that couldn't be possible without it. That brings me to the opening scene, which is one of the most mesmerizing in movie history. How can I explain it? There isn't a single camera cut for the first 15 minutes of the movie. Everything you see happens in one shot. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, as it is for the entire movie, but here it really stands out. The views of the Earth from space are breathtaking (literaly!). The silence of it all really emphasizes how alone they really are in space. Throughout almost the entire film, there is no sound except for the astronaut's voices and the vibrations they feel through their suits. So, no, there are no huge explosions or crashes that shake the theater, because, there is no sound in space (anyone remember the tag-line 'No one can hear your screams in space'?). One might wonder if the movie would be boring because it would be silent the entire time, right? Actually, it is quite the opposite. Steven Price's musical score for this movie is phenomenal in every sense of the word. It takes the place of all the noises that you would normally hear in a movie. It makes you really feel a sense of genuine fear and desperateness while also protruding an enormous emotional impact at the end of the movie. This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in my life. When talking of story/plot and characters, some would argue that it could've been better. I couldn't disagree more. The plot is pretty streamlined and simple, but that's the point. It's not supposed to have a narrative that rivals 'Inception'. At it's core, this is a story about the characters. And as impressive as it is technically, this movie has an excellent development of it's characters and takes them very seriously. Sandra Bullock's character is, once again, the stand out here. Her emotional journey throughout the movie has a great affect on the audience and will stay with them long after the movie is over. I haven't enjoyed and appreciated a character arc this much in a very, very long time.I believe a lot of people are dismissing this movie as a stupid special effects money-maker. It is anything but that. Director Alfronso Cuaron ('Children of Men') has directed yet another masterpiece that will go down as one of the greatest achievements in movie-making history.This is only the 4th movie I've ever given a perfect score of 10/10 to.",9,4,6,12 November 2013
Fury," Just another war movie...
","From a technical standpoint, this movie is a masterpiece. The acting (Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal) directing (David Ayer), soundtrack (Gravity's Steven Price), sound design, editing, cinematography, and visual and special effects are all some of best you'll see and hear all year. Where this movie falls short is in its pacing, storytelling, and characters. This is a war movie, and with that comes the same clichés and characters we've seen in all of them. That isn't to say the story is bad, it's just more of the same. The pacing however, especially in the second act, is mixed.Overall, it's worth seeing. Maybe not in theaters (especially if you have a home theater at home for the incredible sound design) but it is entertaining enough and it gives you it's fare share of the brutalities of war.",7,2,6,8 November 2014
Interstellar," Nolan's most ambitious film reaches into human philosophy and features the most incredible special effects ever seen in a movie
","As I walked out of the Cinemark IMAX theater my brain was still attempting to piece together strings of words but it seemed I had forgotten how to do this. I felt sick inside yet, at the same time, overwhelmed with emotion. I was speechless. I felt like I had just witnessed the most complete and satisfying movie I had ever seen in my life.Interstellar is something I have never seen before; this is a once in a lifetime movie. I had been waiting for this movie ever since it was announced Christopher Nolan was attached to direct and co-write it. The nearly three year wait was more than worth it. Christopher Nolan has done the impossible, again. Not only has he once more outdone himself but he has changed the blockbuster, arguably, for the third time after doing so with the Dark Knight and Inception.I wouldn't go as far as to say this movie is indeed a blockbuster because it's really so much more than that, as one would expect from Christopher Nolan. Sure, there is a fair amount of action, and when it's present on screen it is indeed incredible and furiously exciting. The special effects are literally breathtaking. Last year I hailed Gravity to no end for it's astounding CGI but Interstellar has brought it to the next level. Every single CGI shot looks 100% real. It was jaw dropping. This is by far the most glorious visually awe-inspiring film I've (once again) seen.As for the rest of the technical parts of the movie, all are currently unmatched in 2014. Replacing Wally Pfister as cinematographer is Hoyte Van Hoytema, whose previous works include Her and the Fighter, both of which were beautifully filmed movies. Hoytema works with such confidence behind the camera that I felt completely immersed in the movie. Every shot was gorgeous, which is something I can't say for many movies. I really can't stress how well Hoytema was able to capture the immense vastness of space and the infinitesimal size of the earth and humans. There are also many shots reminiscent of 2001 (it never feels copied, though) and inspiration shines through them.The sound design and are top notch. The IMAX theaters really emphasize how epic in scope this movie is. It is ear shattering, chest rumbling, and incredibly loud. The detail is astounding. If there is only one movie you will ever see in IMAX, make it this one. Interstellar was made to be seen this way. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful and terrifying all at once, which is how I would also describe space itself. Zimmer has created a completely original and unconventional soundtrack that simply brings the movie to near perfection. It's one of his most unique and haunting scores yet.There have been talks about Matthew McConaughey's performance not being up to par, and, well, I honestly couldn't disagree more. Is it Oscar worthy? Perhaps a nomination at least, but really it doesn't matter. He was dazzling. Anne Hathaway also gives the best performance of her career and this is another example of how her talent has just recently been truly discovered. Mackenzie Foy, McConaughey's in-movie daughter, was excellent as well. Child actors starring in adult movies doesn't often work but here it does. She was just as good, if not better, than both McConaughey and Hathaway. The rest of the cast, including Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Wes Bentley, and Casey Affleck, are great as well, even if not terribly important.The thing that is really splitting audiences and critics alike is the screenplay and writing. As usual with Nolan's films, the screenplay ranges from very good to, lets just say decent. There's a rare few lines of dialogue that are sometimes just awkward but for the most part it stays realistic and natural. The exposition, much like Inception, is great (as in there's a lot of it). However, unlike Inception, characters aren't constantly explaining the plot but instead the science, which I will admit is at times overwhelming. The film deals with huge scientific theories and ideas that are beyond the average viewer. The film does its best to keep everyone on the same page, though, which in itself is an impressive achievement. Overall, I'm pleased with the screenplay but it doesn't match the magic of some of Nolan's older work like Memento, the Prestige, or the Dark Knight.As far as the story is concerned, it reaches true 'hardcore' science fiction, much like 2001 did. The final thirty minutes or so had me absolutely floored and blown away. Most of the movie stays within the realms of factual science, thanks to genius physicist and black hole junkie Kip Thorne, who is credited as executive producer and was a major factor in creating realist visions of the wormholes and black holes as well as solving equations to determine certain plot points. The ending, however, is purely theoretical and Christopher Nolan's imagination. The results are dumbfounding. I haven't been this shocked in science fiction since 2001.However, since the ending is subjective and completely unconventional there will be a difference of opinions which is most likely what Nolan was going for. Unlike 2001 where a lot was left up to the viewer's interpretation, I believe there is a true and definitive answer to everything that happens in Interstellar. In a way, the movie does a great job of giving you just enough information to make it enjoyable instead of frustrating and confusing. Some people prefer to have the answers handed to them but others, like myself, prefer to interpret it our own ways and within our understanding. Interstellar does a little of both, which I thought was appropriate given the situation.Interstellar is Nolan's most ambitious and epic film yet and is going to stay with me for days. It leaves you with just enough thought provoking material that it leaves you completely satisfied and fulfilled.",9,2,8,7 November 2014
Nightcrawler," Gyllenhaal Gives An Excellent Performance
","Nightcrawler is a very well made movie. The acting was top notch; Gyllenhaal gave an extremely subtle and very creepy performance. Dan Gilroy's directing shines throughout the dark visual aesthetics of the excellent cinematography. The movie does a lot of things right but where it ultimately fails is in its storytelling.The movie is, at many instances, truly very tense and creepy, sometimes both at once. But in the end, the movie doesn't truly give the audience anything to care about. The plot is interesting enough and I appreciate that it's trying to do something a little different but with out giving it's viewers any real substance, there's not too much more to say...Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was seriously fantastic, though. He felt like such a real creep it was almost disturbing.",7,1,1,25 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," One of the best movies of the year and the best X-Men movie yet!
","Brian Singer has truly outdone himself with this one. Not only is the action dazzling, the soundtrack exciting and emotional (the old X2 theme returns!), the special effects top notch, the cinematography great, the direction amazing, and the acting phenomenal, but the story and the character development is what really sets this movie apart. You genuinely care about these people and what happens. As far as comic book movies go, it doesn't get any better than this. Not since the Dark Knight Trilogy has there been such an emphasis on story and character rather than the VFX and action. My already high expectations were easily surpassed. Fans of both First Class and the originals will love this one. It's the perfect reboot/sequel and as an X-Men fan I couldn't be happier!",9,0,2,8 November 2014
Beasts of No Nation," Abraham Attah gives one of the best child performance's of all time and one of the best performances of any actor of the year
","Perhaps this film's biggest issue is its pacing and length at two hours and 17 minutes. A film's length must be justified in the content shown but unfortunately this feels more like a director's cut rather than 'theatrical cut.' But maybe that's the point, considering it's a Netflix exclusive with minimal theater release.First off, the film is shot *gorgeously* with a lot of experimenting done with the saturation and hues of the colors. There are also multiple 'hidden' long takes that are nearly as impressive as the one in the first season of True Detective, also directed by Fukunuga.Idris Elba gives a great and subtle performance as usual but the real star here is Abraham Attah doing unbelievable work not just for child actors but actors in general. The amount of pain he's effortlessly able to express with only his eyes is astounding. Overall, the acting throughout the movie from everyone almost makes this feel more like a documentary due to how real everything feels. This is exemplified by the sets and battle sequences that use minimal special effects to create an environment that feels real and tangible.As for the story it really isn't anything we haven't seen before in film, especially if you've seen City of God. Take note, City of God and Beasts of No Nation may be similar in theme and story, but the tones and style are completely different with each one being unique in its own way (I greatly prefer the deep emotional connection I got from Agu in Beasts over the distracting shaky cam in City).Overall, Beasts of No Nation is an excellent film that at times can be hard to watch. It isn't overly gory and bloody but its subject theme is highly disturbing and the development of Agu slowing becoming accustomed to war is truly riveting and emotional. The final ten minutes completely relies on Abraham Attah's performance and he makes it some of the best film making of the year.8.5/10",8,3,6,26 October 2015
Gone Girl," Another one of Fincher's great thrillers
","Truly horrifying and disturbing yet so riveting and suspenseful that you can't help but keep your eyes glued to the screen. David Fincher directs with such care and accuracy and keeps his actors focused and attentive that every detail is obsessed over and nears perfection. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike both turn in excellent performances that are both intense yet natural at the same time giving their characters subtle and conflicting inner emotions that aren't always clearly shown. Considering the very lengthy runtime of 149 minutes the movie rarely gets boring. Gilliam Flynn's (also the author of the book) script is filled with rich character development and is full of references of the human condition and a person's capacity for violence.Overall, Gone Girl is an extremely well made movie but only lacks in the actual story and the ending which can (understandably) leave many feeling unsatisfied.",8,1,7,8 November 2014
Mr. Nobody," One Of My Favorite Films of All Time
","Everything about this film amounts to perfection; this is where film making and art start to blend together. The amount of artistic value in this movie is staggering. Special and visual effects are gorgeous, making excellent use of their simplicity. The cinematography... Where do I even start? It's absolutely phenomenal in every sense of the word. Some of the shots are so inventive and smart my jaw was (unknowingly) hanging open at times.Set design is excellent as is the sound design. Editing is a work of wonder. The film is so perfectly paced that it never gets boring and constantly keeps your attention. This is of course possible due not only to the editing but also the direction and use of a nonlinear plot. Direction is masterful. Jaco Van Dormael uses every resource at his disposal to the maximum and has an eye for the smallest of smallest of details, right down to the colors certain characters wear (he does this in a very specific manner).Pierre Van Dormael composed one of the best soundtracks of all time for Mr. Nobody. His use of simple string instruments bring an emotional touch but it allows the film to breathe. There's also a wide selection of different songs used throughout the movie and it's all perfectly used. I don't normally like when unoriginal music is used in movies but when it's done with the precision and care that it was here it works out extremely well.Every character is cast perfectly and each give incredible performances. Jared Leto, Juno Temple, and Toby Regbo are the standouts here. Each of their performances were breathtaking. Again, I don't usually enjoy having child actors in movies because they normally can't hold up to their adult co-starts but, once again, in Mr. Nobody it's different. I really hope Toby Regbo finds more work; he deserves it.Lastly, the story. I already mentioned how the nonlinear plot is used excellently and keeps the film moving. The only time nonlinear films have worked so well were in Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' and 'The Prestige'.The story is written by Van Dormael with such care and attention it's astonishing. I first saw the film a few months before this review and as of this writing I still think about it nearly everyday. The amount of times I was able to relate to the main characters was something special. This is a very human film with a very human core. Sure, it asks questions about reality and time and space but really it's about the people and how they progress as the story moves on. The film deals with a lot of heavy topics, some even controversial to certain religions (Christian among many others). This movie makes you think. It asks you questions and you, in turn, naturally start to debate them in your head as you watch. The film does an excellent job of keeping its viewers engaged in the story.This isn't a film for everyone (hence the 7.9 rating with only 92000 votes). This is a very intellectual, philosophical, and emotional story. I think some could relate it to 'Inception' because it deals with some similar themes that question reality and just the fact that it can be so incredibly confusing!The way I perceived myself and reality changed after I watched this movie. Give this film a chance (it's even on Netflix). It amazes me how few people have actually seen this film. Even the late Roger Ebert never posted a review. This is one of those hidden movie gems. It isn't any one genre for it spans all the way from science fiction to modern day drama to romance. It's impossible to describe to someone for a reason. Overall, it's a very refreshing take on film in this age of Transformers sequels and Avengers mash-ups. It's probably one of the most original and unique movies ever made.",10,5,8,6 August 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Disappointing, to say the least...
","The best scenes in this movie are those that contain both Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield. Their on screen chemistry is just so perfect that it almost, just almost, covers up the terrible dialogue and directing. Ultimately, TASM2 collapses in on itself while trying to juggle too many story lines and villains all at once. Speaking of villains, they're all terrible with clichéd stories and have no logical motivation or sense.Oh well, the CGI ranged from amazing to downright terrible. Overall, turn your brain off and it'll be quite enjoyable as some the action sequences are actually pretty well done.",6,1,6,8 November 2014
Ex Machina," If I had only one word to describe this film it would be 'unnerving.'
","The entire movie has this certain eeriness and tense foreboding that makes you uncomfortable. The acting all around is pretty good but it's Alicia Vikander who is truly remarkable as Ava, the AI robot. First time director Alex Garland makes it look effortless and his script is just as good. This is hard science-fiction and it really makes you think. It doesn't delve into familiar territory like you'd expect but instead takes you down an unfamiliar path that keeps you guessing.The only downfall of the film, in my opinion, is the ending which feels unsatisfying. There's probably a lot who disagree with me and it was by no means bad it was just, by comparison to everything that came before it, underwhelming.The film also features some great cinematography and set design, contrasting the sleek, modern, and high tech house with the green and calm of nature. It's very well done.",8,0,3,25 May 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Oh boy!
","I saw this Thursday night before May 1st in a jam packed IMAX theater with some of my friends and it was honestly one of the best movie theater going experiences I've ever had! That being said, the film itself has essentially the same overall plot as the first film but what we got was pretty cool. The action was very, very well done and the cinematography is up there with The Dark Knight films and Man of Steel (those having the best film work out of the superhero films, imo). The script was amazing and the dialogue was perfect, encompassing who these characters are at heart.Where this film faults is its very thin narrative and pacing. The nearly two and a half hour film flies by without notice and there is literally never a boring moment BUT there are many subplots that aren't fully developed (which will more than likely be solved in the bluray extended release).Overall, while extremely enjoyable, the film suffers from the same exact problems the first film had. You know exactly how it will end and the narrative really just isn't that interesting.That opening tracking shot though...the ticket is worth the price just for that scene alone! 7.5/10",7,1,4,17 May 2015
Whiplash," Holy ****.
","This film blew me away; as soon as it would start to slow down it'd slam me back up against the wall and my eyes would be glued to the screen. This is pure cinema. This is art. It's essentially flawless. The script and direction are so incredibly well done it made my head spin. Every scene has raw power behind it. Right from the start there is this immediate sense of tension. You're legs won't stop bouncing and you're not entirely sure why. This is a testament to the immaculate talent on display in front and behind the camera. Miles Teller and JK Simmons absolutely destroy their competition. They dedicated themselves to every scene, every line of incredibly written dialogue and the pay off is spectacular.If I were to criticize one thing, just for the sake of nitpicking, I would say the overall story is slightly shallow (you basically know how the movie will end, what matters is the journey). The film is far from predictable and keeps you at the edge of your seat (quite literally) but some may be underwhelmed by the ending.Oh, and the editing was fantastic; some of the best this year right up there with Birdman and the Raid 2.",9,0,2,6 February 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," One of the best movies 2014 has to offer and one of my all time personal favorites
","Birdman, to put it simply, was exhausting to watch. I don't mean this in a negative way - in fact, it's a compliment. There really aren't words potent enough to describe how masterful the directing, cinematography, and editing are. Birdman is a masterclass of technical marvels - marvels that aren't in your face screaming, 'Look at how amazing this movie is!'. Birdman is a film of subtlety; its message and themes may be hard to grasp but once you grab hold, it's nothing short of an extraordinary ride.Emmanuel Lubezki. This man is a god of modern day cinematography. Lubezki has outdone himself again after his (stunning) work on last year's 'Gravity' (which won him an Oscar as well as dozens of other awards) and 2006's fantastically shot 'Children of Men'. Throughout the entire main story of Birdman, the camera. Never. Cuts. Or so it appears that way, thanks to ingenious strokes of editing mastery. Films have attempted long shots in the past, one of the most famous being the tracking shot from Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'. Imagine a shot done just as well, if not better, and with so many intricacies but throughout the entire film. It's jaw-dropping. It makes everything seem so real and focused, and, as a result of this, exhausting to watch. It thrusts the audience into the picture; we are living and breathing in the movie along with the characters. This is a fare feat in film making. It's been done, sure, but not in this way. Not in a way so clever and genius yet simple and subtle.Alejandro González Iñárritu brings more complexity but seemingly simplistic talent to Birdman with his excellent direction. He knows exactly what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, and when it needs to be done. It's brilliant and thoroughly entertaining.Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone all give the best performances of their careers, which is especially notable for Norton given his past works. It never feels like they're are acting; they feel like real people. The performances are, once again, subtle and incredibly natural giving everything a more genuine feel. The rest of the cast is great as well but don't standout as much.Birdman is a simple movie, or it appears that way. Underneath it's a complex beast full of ideology and philosophy about life, the people we spend life with, and, most importantly, who we ourselves are. It also spends a fair amount of time analyzing what the film industry has become as well as what impact critics have on both artists and audiences. It's a fascinating study of modern society.If someone were to ask me what Birdman was about I'd tell them it's really just a simple metaphor of life itself. Its beautiful, sad, funny, and enormously rewarding. I couldn't recommend this movie enough. If you're looking for that sense of wonder you haven't felt in cinemas in quite some time, look no further; Birdman came to save you!",9,4,13,15 November 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A near masterpiece tampered with by greedy studio hands
","After watching the film for a fourth time I still find it just as provocative and smart. This is a huge budget art film. From the retelling of age old tales and blocking that mimics ancient art, Snyder's art history major is showing full force throughout the entire film.Lex Luthor's moral perspective is fascinating. He isn't the traditional Lex, no, but none of the characters are their traditional selves. 'God can not be all good if He is all powerful; and He can not be all powerful if He is all good.' Lex views God as an idea of either power or good. In his experience, God is all powerful. And Superman is that God. Or perhaps a Devil. A Devil from the sky.Bruce Wayne sees eye to eye with Lex regarding Superman but takes matters into his own hands. Batman has never been portrayed like this on screen before: tired, beaten, angry, psychotic. Bruce is on the edge of completely breaking down and seeing Superman nearly pushes him off that edge. Both Bruce and Lex see a villain in 'the superman'. They see someone with the power to destroy the entire planet if he so desired. That is the power of the Gods. But if Superman is all powerful, then he can not be all good. 'If there is even a one percent chance that he is our enemy then we have to take it as an absolute certainty,' Bruce yells at Alfred. Calling Lex a villain in this story doesn't seem right. He and Batman both share the same goal: protect the planet.However it's only Batman who realizes that Superman is a person. A person with a mother. He was about to murder a mother's son. Just like someone murdered his parents. Batman's entire world crashed in a few short moments. He was so blinded by his failures (Robin, Gotham) that he became what he originally sought to prevent. He became a vigilante who killed, who had very little respect for the lives he deemed unworthy. He had become the judge and the executioner.As for Superman/Clark, he's constantly tortured by his power. He has this power, but how is he supposed to use it? Does he even need to use it? 'You don't owe this world a thing,' his mother tells him on the farm. Superman feels a responsibility to protect the ones who don't understand him. To not understand is to fear. But there are those who Superman inspires hope in. In one of the strongest scenes of the film, people look up to him in tears. He's their savior. The idea of Superman inspires hope in our world at home, I mean of course it does. One person to save us all from ourselves. One person to stop every terrorist attack, to save everyone from every natural disaster. We have a traditional view of Superman -- a boy-scout with a smile who always does the right thing. Because that's what we want. We want, maybe even, need someone like that in our world. But what about that person -- the superman. How is he to decide who should live and die, who should be punished and praised. Good and evil are matters of perspective. Soldiers on either sides of a war pray to the same God. Who does God help?That being said, the movie absolutely has its issues. And I wholeheartedly believe it's not Snyder and co's fault. The studio had certain check marks that they wanted in the film and Snyder obeyed. Wonder Woman did not, and should not, have been in this film. Her fight scenes were awesome yeah, and I'm grateful that Snyder got the chance to establish the visual flair behind her fighting style for her solo movie, but her scenes really ground the pacing down to a halt every time. It was so clear that she did not fit in with the story. But oh well, I'm incredibly grateful that this piece of modern art is allowed to exist amongst the rehashed comic book/comedy/action film that comes out every few months.Also, the Ultimate Edition is much better than the theatrical cut and feels much more Snyder-y.",9,5,7,17 December 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Oh my *beep* god. George Miller, what have you done??
","Let me but this as bluntly as I can: This is the best action film ever made in the history of cinema.Forget that the action is all done with mind-blowing practical effects (my friend couldn't believe me when I told him that after the film was over) but the actual storytelling was excellent! The story was pretty thin but it's the way that it was told that made it so amazing. Even the characters themselves have a lot of subtle and great development that bring a human touch to a world so full of insanity.But the action scenes. One review put it perfectly: 'The first car chase in MM: FR is the best in movie history but the worst one of the film.' That pretty much sums up the rest of the movie.Oh yeah, and the opening shot to the film is the best opening shot to a movie this year, without question. It isn't grandiose like the Avenger's opening tracking shot but it's so gorgeous too look at I wanted to pause it in the theater just to admire it.9.0/10 Action movies are slowly making a come back...first John Wick, then Kingsman, and now this.
