It," Based on the book by Steven King
","So IT the movie was a good start to a movie series, it was suspenseful and thrilling, however, it seems as if they were missing background information. For example, the history behind who Pennywise the clown was, was not completely explained, making it difficult for individuals who have not had previously seen the older series, or read the novel. On the upside, having Pennywise look more outdated in his costuming, established to the audience that the character was misplaced in the town of Dary, and therefore, poses a threat.As a viewer, I was expecting it to be a lot more scarier. For instance, in the older version of the series, the character of Pennywise would torment the children in a more personal way. Though this was done in the movie, at times this appeared to be more comical, and the lack of background given for certain characters made the audience have a lack of empathy for them. In terms of the relationships established between the characters, Bill's brotherly feelings toward his little brother, Georgie, were more recognized than in the previous series. Furthermore, due to Pennywise tormenting the children based on their worse fears, having Beverly live in her own fear, made the end of the movie more effective in showing their victory over the enemy.",Null,0,0,13 October 2017
