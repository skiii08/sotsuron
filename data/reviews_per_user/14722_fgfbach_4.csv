Black Swan," simply the best of 2010
","Great start, great tempo, great tension, great acting, great development, great camera movements, and 'almost' a great finish... . One of the best about the film is that you really feel as if you are Nina (Natalie Portman) in there actually practicing and playing the swan lake in the stage, fantastic camera angles with enough music. Aronofsky leaves the best part of the swan lake for the finish and it has a much better meaning to those who know the swan lake of Tchaikovsky because as one of those i waited for the main melody during the film and i got the best satisfaction at the very end (not considering some short passages like mobile phone melody etc) No need to criticise Natalie Portman, as she overcomed a very difficult role full of schizophrenia and sexual trials, her acting when she calls her mother about her winning the role of the swan is a forever generic. i could not forget the film even if 3 days passed and i still feel it. The only thing negative for me is that maybe -only maybe- the finish could have been more touchy, it is really simple comparing all the process. Anyway, even the finish affected me so much after some seconds of hesitations. . This is what people call 'A masterpiece'...Worths watching couple of times, simply the best of 2010.",10,2,5,7 March 2011
Crash," Oscar makes expectations higher
","The film is about ordinary people and important people's daily lives and strange coincidences between them, it's pure life actually and there's almost nothing which is not natural, (sorry, except the extreme behaviors of the iranian daddy), i watched the film in one gulp and did not get annoyed except the last 15 minutes which is too slow and predictable (same feeling like 'no country for old men'), for me the music is so poor that it is one of the reasons for me why i did not give more than 7, its a good film, but music never supports the scenes and especially the final scenes are accompanied with a very simple random-radio song... and i think Oscar is a little bit too heavy, the film has not any action and almost all the scenes are in the same frequency, some poor music background and same kind of conversations, anyway, its a good film and worths watching once, probably you wouldn't want to watch it the second time as it does not have any hit scenes, or touchy quotes...or music.. watch it too see how ordinary life might be so complex around us...it'S pure life, but to see life on TV whereas you have the real one, is somewhat boring isn't it ?",7,0,2,12 February 2011
LÃ©on: The Professional," one of the most powerful film in terms of very strong characteristics in each one
","A tiny quick memento about the director before i start my comment ; This film has a special meaning to me (which i realized after i watched it), as a newcomer, after Angel-A, i decided to watch Leon, and after the film i started to check what other films were there from Luc Besson, and i was very much surprised when i saw SUBWAY which was the first film i saw in cinema when i was around 10 years old, thanks to my uncle my cinema-career had already started with such a powerful director. Regarding the film, The first impression for me about the film is that the characters are so powerful that each one grabs you till the scene changes, even those who appear not more than some minutes or even seconds.. there is a surprising low-tempo in the middle of the film which - i think- prepares us to the final shot, the music and effects are used in almost every scene, it may absurd to say but this film is like a mixture of a clockwork orange and taxi driver, the characters are very crazy and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) reminded me of Iris (Jodie Foster), The first 30 minutes is a complete master piece, tension is so high that you feel you are in the film witnessing the slaughter in the apartment walking in the corridor, i hardly remember any other film which takes me to the deepest level so powerful and effective (old boy, sympathy for lady vengeance), but i must say that i disliked the music plays before the final shot when Mathilda and Leon seen together for the last time, i don't like too much repetition in Music, and that scene disturbed me because of this, anyway, from the start to the end its one of the craziest yet one of the most sentimental one, get a glass of milk, water your plants and start to watch.",9,2,3,7 February 2011
American Beauty," too simple, not boring
","The film is about some American families with their own problems and the reflections to out of their houses, for me there is nothing to re-watch the DVD except one of the greatest love scenes i have ever seen in a film, the scene where the boy showed the girl the best film he ever made, a nylon bag dancing in the air trying to obey what the wind says, together with leaves, minutes before the snow as he says... the characters are extremely different and does not fit to usual life, (if any, its very rare), no music, no effects, no action, no any memorable and effective quotes, yet its a good film for one time. For me the good film needs to be watched again and again, i did not get this feeling in this film, despite Kevin Spacey and Wes Bentley's perfect performance, but the nylon bag scene is 'forever' and something different. i liked that scene so much that i had a break in the middle of the film watching the same scene a couple of times.. watch it, but don't expect big things just because it won the Oscar...",6,1,3,12 February 2011
