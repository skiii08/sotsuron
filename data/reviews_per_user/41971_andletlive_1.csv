The Lobster," Pretentiously 'intellectual', ridden with flaws – in logic, and in direction.
","A social critique, but through a parody ridden with flaws – in logic, and in direction. Pretentiously 'intellectual', funny if you are into sadism – and cynical. Original? Yes, but so what? The acting is flat – intentionally? Who cares. The 'story' grabs you at the beginning, but parts are even predictable. They probably thought they were making an 'art' film – in this case, by nerds for nerds. I hope to forget it soon.",5,1,1,7 July 2017
