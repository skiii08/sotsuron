The Avengers," Box Office Avenged!!!! A complete treat..a must watch!!Go Go Go Avengers!!!
","The very beginning of the movie is capable enough to build your interest and keeps you watching. The movies has many relative terms from other movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and people who haven't seen 'Captain America:The First Avenger' or 'Thor'or 'The Incredible Hulk'or 'Ironman' might have to scratch their heads at times...but that will not matter a lot because the movie will keep you laughing and will keep you in the moment, never letting you get bored. The movie is intense at many times, thrilling a sometimes too..but the action and comedy is amazing. Especially the scene where Loki is beaten up by Hulk like a washer-man's clothes will keep you laughing even after Hulk is finished up with his beating. Every time you start thinking that you are getting bored, and start sliding on your seat, something will happen in the movie and you will straighten up on your seat, waiting for more. The movie will keep on building a plot for action throughout its length and will blast your head with thrilling action scenes in the end. The performance by every actor is respectable. The dignity of each character is maintained. None of the superheroes is portrayed miser than others. Even Hawkeye and Black Widow gain audience's respect in the end. In short, the movie is a must watch and for the fans of any of The Avengers or the superheroes who are a part of it will commit a sin if they do not watch this movie.",9,2,6,27 April 2012
Insidious," A movie for them who get freaked by real ghosts and spirits....and not by a brain operation scene or blood flowing from every part of the body.
","The movie starts with average during-the-title scene and later becomes more boring and just at the point when you start losing interest in the movie, then and there you see scenes that surely bring your interest back. But then you start thinking that this is just an average 'haunted-house drama' and again you put your thoughts away because you start being served with scenes and sounds that blow off your mind and force you keep your eyes and ears closed for the next 60 mins. But if you take my advice, don't close your eyes or even ears, because this movie is a treat to watch. And if you can watch this movie with your eyes open all the time, then i bet you can watch almost 90% of other horror movies because they are no way close to Insidious. If horror movies start getting the Oscars, i think Insidious would grab a few of them because it really deserves it.",9,0,2,31 March 2012
