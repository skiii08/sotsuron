Hereditary," I am shocked at the bad reviews here
","Seriously. What the heck is up with all the negativity here for this film? I honestly think people have been forced fed way too many of these crappy jump scare horror movies, that they don't even know what a good one looks like when they watch it. Movies where the story serves only to set up the 'BOO!' and then continues to the next one. This film has depth, originality, quality acting, a solid story, and some truly unsettling moments and atmosphere. It is not perfect. It has some slower moments and it is long but those are really no reasons to write this one of. I enjoyed the ending and there were plenty of clues and foreshadowing for it all to make sense if you actually pay attention to what's happening. It's not the kind of movie that you can just watch in the background and expect to get a good thrill from. It doesn't jump at you; it creeps up on you and claws it's way in. I guess it's not for everybody but if you like horror movies that make you think you'll probably enjoy this one.",8,1,2,27 August 2018
Split," I really don't understand where the hate is coming from
",Seriously. This movie is so good and I don't get why everyone is hating on it. James McAvoy's acting is Oscar worthy. The story is very solid and I really liked the ending. I honestly think people are just jumping on the 'anti-Shyamalan' bandwagon. This could have been the best movie ever made and there would be all these people here crapping all over it. I don't get it. Just watch this movie for what it is and not who directed it and you'll really enjoy it.,8,12,17,25 June 2018
