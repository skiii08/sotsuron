The Blair Witch Project," Even after all the hype I was scared.
","I saw Blair Witch finally. As I walked in at the UA Galaxy 9 in Dallas, the ushers were cleaning vomit up and several seats were blocked off because they had been vomited on. 'Yeah people are getting motion sickness because the camera work is shaky.' Whatever, I thought, some people are wimps. Until the movie started. Because the screen was so big and the image so jumpy I seriously had to concentrate to keep from vomiting. I had to take deep breaths like after I've drank too much. Anyway the movie had some scary moments, but nothing that made me believe all the hype......until the end, needless to say, my friends and I were all scared by the ending. It'sambiguous, but it's so freaking cool. When I got home I was scared until I had all the lights on, and my friends were with me!! If you want to be scared pay attention to all the legends described by the townsfolk during the first 30 or so minutes they will help you make sense of some of the things that happen later. Go see it, but don't say I didn't warn you.",8,1,1,7 August 1999
