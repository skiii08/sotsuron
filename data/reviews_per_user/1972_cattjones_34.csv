The Avengers," 3D Extravaganza
","It has been a long time that I had to wait in line to buy a ticket and then wait in line again to get a good seat. The Avengers was well worth the wait. Director Joss Whedon definitely got it right with this film. Although the film was nearly two and a half hours long it did not feel like it because the momentum of the story flowed so well. As you can tell by the trailer, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned to take over the earth and is met by a cast of superheroes assembled by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). All of the main characters were true to form. Iron Man / Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was exactly like you would expect him to be; arrogant, smart and playful. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) follows his so called brother Loki to earth and the tension between them has not changed from the last time that these two hit the big screen. The Hulk / Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) somehow manages to somewhat tame his beast and join the party. Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has the daunting task of trying to catch up with time while forming a relationship with his new found comrades. I found him to be the most endearing of the heroes because he had so much catching up to do since he was thawed out. The two heroes that did not have their own introduction prior to this film were Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye / Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), although I think that a prequel could possibly work because I think that there is definitely some history there. I have to say that I was not expecting this film to have the level of comedy that it did. I think that the whole audience was caught a little off guard (myself included). Everything about this film was excellent; the acting, the special effects, the character development, the script I could go on and on. I am almost certain that this is not the last time that we see The Avengers. I smell the beginning of many more sequels in the future and I will once again stand in that long line to go and see them. This is not the time to be frugal. Dig in your pockets and go and see this film at the IMAX in 3D. I am giving this film a glaring green light.",10,2,7,7 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Alien Fun
","It is really hard to believe that it has been 10 years since the last Men in Black film. I have to say that this film was much better than the last film which was really just a regurgitation of the first one. This film had a lot more substance and managed to tie up some loose ends which I really appreciated. I think that this film works in 3D because there is a lot of falling through time, which my niece and nephew loved. I have to give major props to Josh Brolin (younger Agent K) who had the daunting task of portraying an actor portraying a role. Tommy Lee Jones (old Agent K) just basically had to be himself (smile). Josh was totally convincing and did an excellent job imitating Tommy's persona. I liked the introduction of Agent O (Emma Thompson) who had one of the funniest scenes in the film and literally had me laughing out loud. I also liked the fact that a women was in charge of such a prestigious agency. As usual Will Smith (Agent J) came up with very comical explanations of the weird situations that occur during the film. I think that my favorite character in the film is Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg). He was a psychic who could see into the various futures that could occur if certain things happen. I was a little confused at first, but as the film progressed, I finally got it. I related to this character because I have always believed that you always have at least two doors to open (e.g. you can pick up that piece of paper or not) and whatever you decide to do affects everything else. Okay, enough of philosophy class and back to the film. The one thing about all the Men in Black films is all of the different characters that the visual effect crew create. You have to appreciate the imagination of those folks. I also like to check out the aliens that they are monitoring at the agency, for example in the first one they were monitoring Michael Jackson and Agent J's elementary school teacher. Appropriately in this film you get flashes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber (appropriately). I wonder if they have to agree to that? Anyway, this was a very entertaining film and you will be glad that you saw it in 3D. I give this film an out-of-this-world green light. Enjoy!!!",8,75,110,26 May 2012
Skyfall," And Bond Keeps Rolling Along
","I have to say that it has been a while since I've seen a Bond film and this is the first one that I have seen with Daniel Craig in the lead role. I don't remember a 007 film being this long, but I have to say that the adventures of Bond are sure to continue. I just hope that they won't start doing them in pairs, like what they did with the Twilight film (part 1 and part 2). From the trailer, you could tell that James Bond comes back from his supposed demise and has to regenerate himself to protect his fearless leader. The one thing that the film does not explain is exactly how he survived the fall off that bridge. They may have shown it after they ran the credits at the end. I have found that more and more films are doing that, which I hate. Especially since this film was so dog gone long. I think that Daniel Craig did a decent job portraying 007, but I was not used to seeing the super spy so down-trodden. Hopefully he will be more charismatic in the next one (if he is still cast). Dame Judi Dench was a formidable 'M' and was hardened and definitely goal oriented to the task at hand. Javier Bardem was very convincing as the crazy and totally 'out there' villain Silva. He was as nutty and demented as Heath Ledger's Joker. He did a brilliant job making you hate him but at the same time, you wanted to know what the heck he was going to do next. The one thing that I did miss in this film was the abundance of gadgets that are usually introduced, but the film definitely worked without them. It turns out that Ben Whishaw's 'Q' was almost too smart for his own britches, but I like the fact that he was a young character. I hope that they bring back Naomie Harris who played Eve in the next film. I think that she and Daniel had great chemistry on screen. This film did hold true to everything that is the amazing 'Bond'. Although this is yet another butt blister film, it is worth paying the price of a ticket to see it on the big screen. I have to say that the only thing that was missing while viewing this film was a dry martini (shaken, not stirred). I give this film a glaring green light.",9,2,9,15 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Best One Yet
","When I was getting ready to go and see this film I looked it up and discovered that it was two plus hours long. I groaned, and hoped that there would not be a lot of fluff. To my pleasant surprise there was not. It was the first time in a long time, that I could not feel the time go by. There were a couple of surprises that I did not see coming, which made the film even more entertaining. I also liked the fact that the film made reference to what happened to the Avengers back in New York. It gives all the Marvel characters a sense of connectivity. I even saw the same connectivity in the Trailer for the next Thor, where Loki is locked up for what he had done. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) is true to form and brings with him his usual wit and humor. Ben Kingsley (The Mandarin) was brilliant as usual, but I had no idea that his range was so expansive and that he could play this type of role. I think that a lot of folks will be surprised. Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) who is the mad scientist of the bunch, is one of the more creative villains ever created. The 'tug-at-your-heartstrings' role went to Ty Simpkin (Harley Keener), who is quickly befriended by Tony as a mini partner in stopping the bad guys. Although Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) did not have a lot of screen time, her character made a definite impact on the outcome. Don Cheadle (James Rhodes) reprises his character very well, although he gets a bit of a make-over that is kind of cheesy. Director Shane Black has really made a name for himself behind the camera instead of in front of one. I have to say that I liked this Iron Man better than the previous films. I think it was because this film focused more on the man instead of the superhero. We get a chance to see Tony as a little vulnerable and that he has issues just like the rest of us. I did not see this film in 3D, but I could see where some of the action scenes would have been more explosive in that format. I have to say that I left the theater smiling because I thoroughly had a good time (you will too). I give this film a glaring green light.",8,1,5,3 May 2013
42," Excellent Story and Acting. Great!!!!
","When I entered the theater I noticed a vast variety of folks coming to see this film; from the very old to the very young. There was even a coach that brought what seemed like his whole little league team. As you know I am not a huge fan of bio-pics, but I wanted to see this story just because of the amazing achievement of this man. I remember how hard things were in the 1960s, so I can't imagine how tough times were in 1947. The fact that Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) not only had to be a great ball player, but he also had to have the willpower to tame his temper. I am not sure that I know many men who would stand down to the abuse that he suffered. The verbal abuse that was lashed out by Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) was really disturbing, but it did shed a lot of light on what Jackie had to deal with. Luckily Jackie had his wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie) to lean on. It was surprising that Rachel was a bit of a rebel herself, which made her very endearing. General Manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) was also a bit of a rebel; just a different kind. Leo was rambunctious and seemingly did whatever he wanted. He turned out to be a color-blind manager and he did not care what anyone else thought. Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) was the reporter tasked to chronicle this historic event. He would sit on the 3rd base line with his typewriter in his lap and capture all of Jackie's great moments as well as the intentional injuries that he incurred. Although Jackie is definitely a hero in this film, he is not the only one. Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) was a hero as well. You had to be a special kind of person to change the policies of an entire league. There were many reasons why he wanted to sign the first black player to the Brooklyn Dodgers, but I think that the one that he gave at the end of the film was the one that tugged at my heart. This is one film that I think everyone should see because there are so many lessons that can be learned and taught to the next generation. The one thing that I did not know was that during one game of every season, all the Brooklyn Dodgers wear number 42. Very cool. I give this film a green light.",Null,1,2,13 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Live Long and Prosper J.J.
","J. J. Abrams must go to a lot of Star Trek conventions; either that or he has a library full of the original series and films. He really hit it out of the park (or out of this world) with this installation of the franchise. I see a lot more of this series in his future and the possibilities are endless. I like this film because it has a lot of action and the story is told very well; but more than that I also like the fact that this film was also about the relationships between the crew. Also, after the first film I was asking myself where the heck are the Klingons? Well, lo and behold they finally make an appearance in this film. There has always been that tension between the Federation and the Klingons so I am glad that they got that storyline started. Chris Pines (James Kirk) is evolving more and more into the William Shatner Kirk of the 60s. He is even starting to look like him a little (although Shatner was not as emotional as this upgraded version). Zachary Quinto (Spock) is as logical as ever, but in this film he even manages to rationalize how he processes his emotion (which I found quite interesting and profound). Zoe Saldana (Uhura) gets to display a more sensitive side and reacts to situations the way that most of us (women) would with our significant other. Once again (as in the 1st film) my favorite portrayal was done by Simon Pegg (Scotty). He was most definitely the comic relief that kept this film balanced. As for Benedict Cumberbatch (Khan), you really didn't know if he was a good guy or bad guy until Spock Prime shows up and gives the crew the down low. Of course being a Trekkie, I knew he was bad, but new comers will not know. The addition of Alice Eve (Carol) to the crew will no doubt create some interesting story lines going forward. I saw this film in 3D and there were a few things that jumped out at you, but all in all I think you should save the extra dollars. I think that you will be just as impressed without the 3D effects. This film was pretty long, but I did not notice because it was so well paced. This film is definitely one that you have to see on the big screen. Live long and prosper!!! I give this film a glaring green light.",9,5,13,17 May 2013
Rise of the Guardians," Great Film!!
","This film was truly enjoyable. Peter Ramsey who is known mostly for his story boarding work did a fantastic job with this film. I think that of all the guardians, the one that I really understood first as a child was the Sandman. In Germany when the sandman came on television, it was time to go to bed. There was no discussion to be had. You simply got up, kissed your parents good night and went to bed. How much simpler life would be for parents of young children if the sandman was still around. The story pretty much centers around Pitch Black or the Boogie Man (Jude Law) wanting to take over the minds of little children and making them forget about all the good images in their lives. North or Santa Clause (Alec Baldwin) is the apparent leader of the guardians and must assemble the group in order to fight Pitch. I am not sure why North has a Russian accent, but I think it worked well. Jack Frost (Chris Pine) is a carefree spirit who is all about having fun and playing in the snow and ice. He is reluctantly recruited by the Man in the Moon as the newest addition to the guardian clan. Jack and Bunny (Hugh Jackman) seem to have a tumultuous relationship which adds the charm of this film. Bunny turns out to be from Australia and welds a mean set of boomerangs. Tooth (Isla Fisher) is endearing and is all about dental hygiene. I particularly liked her helpers; especially baby tooth. The additional elements in the film such as the Yetis (only way I can think to describe them) who are responsible for making the toys and the elves who are responsible for seemingly nothing, adds additional comic relief to the film. I think that one of the things that I liked most about this film is that it kind of explains how all the characters make it around the globe in such a short amount of time. I also like the fact that you got to see where all the characters live (not just Santa). I think that kids (and adults) will enjoy this film and definitely leave the theater with a smile on their face. I am not sure if the 3D is really necessary, but for the extra thrills, go ahead an upgrade. I give this film a celebratory green light.",10,3,6,27 November 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Welcome to the Circus
","This adaptation of John le Carre's book was interesting and somewhat dull at times. I do not generally like period films, but this one is somewhat of an exception. Let me just say to start out with that this was a long film and I was a little anxious to get it over with. If you are looking for the usual action scenes that normally come with these types of films, then you are going to be greatly disappointed. This was a more subtle film with a lot of whispering and back stabbing. The fact that they called their intelligence agency 'the circus' was mildly amusing to me since that is the way I always think of any government agency. In my opinion the film was very slow to get started and there was a lot of jumping around and flash-backing, so there was no time to have your thoughts wonder or drift into a quick nap. It almost seemed like the director Tomas Alfredsen filmed a lot of little segments and then pasted them together like a collage. There was a sub-story in the film where Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) engages in a friendship with one of his young pupils. I remember thinking at the end of the film that they probably could have left that sub-story out. It did not play to the plot at all. I do have to tip my hat to Gary Oldman (George Smiley) who was very believable as the trench coat sudo-detective weaving in and out of the streets of London. This film definitely had that 'independent film' feel to it. I found it interesting that John le Carre made a cameo appearance in the film. I guess he plans on being the next Alfred Hitchcock. The story of the film was very good, but I have to say that I miss the action. I am not sure if I was entertained by the film. It sort of made me feel like I was watching a docu-drama about the European Central Intelligence Agency of the early 70s. I think that if you are into slow-moving, however highly intelligent films then this is probably worth the price of a ticket. If you more of a 'Bourne' action film person, then this might not be for you. As for me, I am the latter, so in saying that, I will not try to perpetrate a cover-up and I am going to give this film an amber light.",Null,0,0,7 January 2012
Life of Pi," Visually Amazing
","Director Ang Lee has done a great job in the ancient art of storytelling. This story of survival of the fittest at sea is visually beautiful although there are scenes that can be a bit disturbing. The story is being told by the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) to a down and out writer (Rafe Spall) who is looking for material for a new book. The film does an excellent job of explaining how Pi got his name and how the lessons of his father helps him to cope with the difficulties that he is about to encounter. I think that the incorporation of religion also added some depth to this film by surmising that religion is not as important as spirituality. Pi (Suraj Sharma), a zebra, hyena, orangutan and a Bengal Tiger (affectionately named Richard Parker) are the survivors of an unexplained shipwreck. From that point on Pi has to figure out a way to stay alive, not just from the animals, but also from Mother Nature herself. I can tell you right now that if it was me on the boat I probably wouldn't have lasted a day. But I guess you never know what you might do when presented with extenuating circumstances. I was not really familiar with any of the actors in this film except Gerard Depardieu who played the cook. Now that I think about it, he was a cook in the last film that I saw him in (Last Holiday with Queen Latifah). Apparently this film was based on a book that no one thought could possibly be made into a film; I guess they were wrong. The mere idea of moving a zoo from one continent to another is pretty mind boggling in itself. I do have to say that the CGI in this film was amazing and took computer imagery to a whole new level, but I would not expect anything less from Lee. I especially liked the scenes in the ocean and the events on the mysterious island. Although this film had a 'G' rating, I am not sure if it would be appropriate for very small children but I enjoyed this film very much. I do want to add that the minor plot twist at the end kind of makes you wonder what to believe. There is no need for a life jacket for this one. I am giving the film a green light.",9,2,5,24 November 2012
Oblivion," Lots of Familiar Twists
","Where is a blue light when you need one? If you take elements of I, Robot, The Matrix, Independence Day, Total Recall and of course Top Gun and put them all in a bowl and mixed them up, you would come up with Oblivion. This film was totally crazy and literally out of this world. And to top it all off, with all the previews and the length of this film be prepared to get butt blisters for two and a half hours. I do have to say that I thought the special effects were brilliantly done, especially with the ship that Jack is flying. I also liked the fact that explanations of what was going on were trickled in throughout the film, right up to the very end. Basically the film centered on a band of rebels that are left on earth after a planetary war who are fighting against the establishment. Jack (Tom Cruise) is a drone repairman with less than two weeks to go on his so called tour of duty. Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) is his eyes in the sky and takes direction from the control center that is wedged in space. As depicted in the trailer, Jack is captured by the rebel tribe and this is where the journey of discovery begins. Beech (Morgan Freeman) is the rebel leader and is determined to get Jack to see the truth. This is also the point in the film where there starts to be a lot of twists and turns. I did hear myself saying (a couple of times), 'what the heck is going on here'. This is when the fun started for me, because I started thinking about all the other films that this one stole from. I think that director Joseph Kosinski did a pretty good job considering the only other film that he has produced was Tron: Legacy. He is definitely headed in the right direction if this is the genre that he wants to stick with. Although the film was a little long for my taste, it was definitely not boring. The film moved at a steady pace and the little enlightenments along the way kept my interest. I think that this film does merit the price of a ticket for the CGI and cinematography alone. Oblivion did not leave me oblivious so I am going to go ahead and give this film a green light.",8,1,4,19 April 2013
Man of Steel," Pretty Super
","This film could have actually been three separate films; the destruction of Krypton, the little boy wonder growing up in Smallville and aliens invade the earth. There were plenty of special effects in this film, almost to the point of overkill. I actually liked the Krypton special effects the best. I thought they were the most creative. When I called my sister and asked her how she liked the film, the first thing that she said was 'it was long'. I must say that I could not agree with her more on that point. The last 30 minutes of the film was a continuous brawl and had me thinking that it would never end. While I was watching Kal-El/Superman (Henry Cavill), the thought that kept running through my mind is that Superman is not all that super (although he was ruggedly handsome). I think that one of the most cleaver things about this film is the way that they kept Jor-El (Russell Crowe) incorporated in the film. That was pretty creative and unexpected. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) was a lot tougher than her predecessors. She was tough and gutsy which was a breath of fresh air from always playing the victim. Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) on the other hand was more docile than I expected. I remember in the comic books there were always a lot of symbols in his dialog box (smile). I didn't expect cursing, but I did expect him to be meaner. Speaking of mean, General Zod (Michael Shannon) fit the bill to a tee and I have to say, he was a tough one to beat. I think that the DC Comic franchise still has a little bit of catching up to do to the Marvel franchise. Unlike the Marvel films, there is no humor; it was straight drama. I never really developed an emotional connection to the character. I also think that I would have liked the film more if the story had been told sequentially instead of filling the screen with an over abundance of retro-vision. I do think that this film is theater worthy, just because of the CGI, but pack a lunch because you are going to be there for a while. This is one of those times that I wish we had a blue light (somewhere between amber and green), but because I am feeling pretty generous today, I am going to go with a green light.",Null,0,0,15 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," At Least a Triple
","I normally do not like movies about sports. I love sports; just not movies about sports. That being said, this film was not so much about baseball as it was about a father and daughter relationship. It also touched on how technology has taken over the human element of scouting for players. This film is the complete opposite of Money Ball, where technology actually helps in building a team. Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves who is struggling with his eyesight and the front office has doubts about whether or not he is still up to the job of spotting up and coming talent. Because of this affliction, Gus is a grumpy old man which actually adds a lot of humor to the film. His character kind of reminded me of the character that Eastwood played in Grand Torino. His daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) discovers that her father is having difficulty, reluctantly takes on the roll of caregiver and follows her father on his scouting adventure. Incidentally, she knows more about baseball than probably anyone else in this film. Johnny Flanagan (Justin Timberlake) is an aspiring sports announcer who was scouted by Gus years ago. The relationship that develops between Mickey (named for Mickey Mantle) and Johnny is fun to watch and provides some insight to Mickey's reluctance to develop a serious relationship with any man. Pete Klein (John Goodman) plays the mediator role that brings Mickey and Gus together. I really liked his unyielding devotion and trust to Gus. It was also good to once again see Scott Eastwood (Billy Clark) act alongside his father. They have acted together in several films, and it was good to see them spending some family time together. I think that the entire cast definitely made this film better and I am sure that it will draw young viewers to the theater. I do not think that this film was utterly brilliant, but it was thoroughly entertaining. There were aspects of the film that were totally predictable, but I looked forward to seeing it play out. Director Robert Lorenz may not have hit it out of the park (like he did with Million Dollar Baby), but I think that it is a definite triple play. I recommend that you do not sit on the bench and go out and see this film. I give this film a green light.",8,81,103,22 September 2012
Hugo," All I Can Say is WOW
","Director Martin Scorsese really hit it out of the park with this one. He has taken 3D movie-making to the next level. This film felt like a fairytale for both adults and children and has forever changed the viewing experience from average to spectacular. Although the film started out a little slow, I think that this is one of Marty's better works and is definitely Oscar-worthy, even if it is just for the cinematography. It kind of had that Oliver Twist feel happening but with a lot more adventure. When I saw the trailer for this film, it really did not give any indication about the content of the film and Emma was not looking forward to seeing it. I was excited just to see what was going on with the 3D. If a commercial boasts that 'if you don't see any other film in 3D, you need to see this one'; that peaked my imagination and the film did not disappoint. Asa Butterfield (Hugo Cabret) was as endearing in this film as he was in The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. The relationships Hugo builds throughout the film definitely keeps you interested and wanting to know what happens next. The station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) added both some comic relief and dramatic moments. Sir Ben Kingsley's character, George Melies transforms throughout the film. You could not really decide if you liked him or if you hated him, but all things are revealed in the end. It is really hard to review this film without giving away its essence, but take my word for it; you will not regret going to see it. This film felt like it was very personal for Mr. Scorsese and although it definitely had a storybook feel, I think that anyone who loves movies (like Emma and I do) has to make sure that this one is on their list of films to see. Who would have thought that Marty would be the person that takes 3D films to another dimension? Even James Cameron stated that it was the best 3D effects that he had ever seen; including his own films. I gained a new found respect for the process of movie-making in general. This film does more than just entertains, but it also gives the audience a brief education. The conductor is shouting ALL ABOARD!!!!! This film leaves the train station with a green light.",Null,4,8,28 November 2011
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-cellent
","I want to start off by saying that my brother, Nick predicted this movie after the 2nd X-Men film. He is a true comic book geek and saw this coming. I am sure that he is not the only one. I was more of a bi-polar comic geek. I read Archie and Richie Rich on good days and Tales from the Crypt and Tales from the Darkside on bad days. I read super hero comics sporadically. My brother informed me that Quicksilver (Evan Peter) is Magneto's son. I had no clue. Speaking of Quicksilver, he was my favorite character in this film. When assigned a task, I never had a concern that he would not complete it. Apparently he will make another appearance in the next film. Once again I neglected to stay through the credits and missed some important information. Nick informs me that it has something to do with the apocalypse. I really need to start staying through the credits of not only Marvel films, but also DC Comic films. Anyway, I was really glad to see the original X-men join forces with their younger selves. They even found a way to include Major Bill Stryker (Josh Helman). I was glad to see Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) as the person with the power to make going back to the past possible, but for some reason I was getting flashbacks to the film Inception. Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) has his mind set on creating Cyborgs that would identify mutants and destroy them and it is the X-Men's goal to travel to the past and to keep the present future from happening. I would be remised if I did not mention Mark Camacho (President Nixon). Not only did he do a great interpretation of the president, but the whole recreation of the 70s was done extremely well. There were glimpses of every X-Men film to date incorporated in this film and the writers did an excellent job tying them all together. This is one of those films that you really do not have to advertise. Most people are so engaged with the X-Men, that it would be almost criminal not to see the franchise through. I thoroughly enjoyed the film because (1) it was not too long and (2) there weren't any dull spots. This is definitely a film worth seeing, especially if you want to be ready for the next one.",10,6,8,24 May 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Good Film; A Bit Long
","Sir Peter Jackson is really trying to keep the franchise going with this prequel to the Lord of the Rings films. I saw an interview with the cast on some morning show and it is just hard to believe that all the dwarfs are over six feet tall. I think that the CGI in films continue to improve and I can't imagine what they will have in store for us in the coming years. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm,old Bilbo) wanting to document his unexpected adventure so that he will be able to share it with his young friend once completed. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) sets off on his journey to help the dwarfs, led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) regain their homeland. Along the way they run into various mini-adventures and have to fight their way through the landscape. Anyway, there were a lot of familiar faces in this film; even Elijah Wood (Frodo) made a brief appearance at the beginning of the film. Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) are among the cast of characters returning to the film. Speaking of Gollum, I think that there were some scenes in this film that were entirely too long (e.g. the riddle scene by the underground lake). My favorite character in this film (and all the films is Gandalf (Ian McKellen). He always seems to show up just when you need him and when he does, you know there is about to be some awesomeness on the screen. I think that the thing that surprised me the most was all the singing in the film; I didn't see that coming. I did enjoy the 'rock' fight.. trust me; it is not what you think. It is evident at the end of the film that there will be a sequel to this prequel; so get ready for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Smaug (by the way) is the name of the fire-breathing dragon in the film. I only hope that this one will not be another butt blister film. I could hear the kids saying that they thought this film was awesome after it was over. I thought that it was pretty entertaining and the film itself was beautifully made. I just wish that it was not almost three hours long. I almost gave it an amber light just for that reason, but I am going to go ahead and give it a green light. 'Lord' lovers will definitely like it.",8,2,9,16 December 2012
Django Unchained," Off the Chain
","Quentin Tarantino has out-done himself on some of the most violent scenes that I have ever seen on the big screen. This film shouldn't be called Django Unchained; it should have been called Tarantino Unchained. There were times during the film that I just could not watch what was happening. On the other hand there are also some very funny moments; mostly delivered by Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz). As seen in the trailer, the doctor needs help in finding some criminals with a very high price on their heads; however he has never seen them. He enlists Django (Jamie Foxx) to help him hunt these men down and soon fully employs him as a bounty hunter. In exchange, the good doctor will help Django to retrieve his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the mega-plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Running the 'big' house on Mister Candie's plantation is Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) who is as loyal as they come and disturbingly dedicated to his master. Django is totally transformed from a down-trodden slave to a self-reliant pistol carrying sharp shooter. I also just want to say that there has been so many films where Germans have been portrayed as the 'bad guy' so it was refreshing to see one that was a good guy. I would be remiss if I did not mention Big Daddy (Don Johnson) who somehow made me think about fried chicken because they dressed him up to look a little bit like Colonel Sanders. The violence in this film is not the only shocking moments; there are some things that are better left not shown (you'll know exactly what I mean once you see the film). It seems like really long movies are starting to become the norm and this film is no exception, although you are so engaged in what is going on in the film that this one did not feel that long. This is a true Tarantino film and you will get exactly what you expect (and then some). In classic Tarantino fashion, he takes you from one extreme (disgust) to the other extreme (laugh out loud funny). This spaghetti western will definitely take you on a roller coaster ride for sure, so buckle up. Even though there were times that I was shaking my head and turning away from the screen, I am going to give this film a green light.",8,4,13,26 December 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Excellent Escapism
","Of all the Bourne films (identity, supremacy, ultimatum and legacy) I have to say that I liked this one the least. I like this one the least because there was no Bourne in it. I do think that writer Tony Gilroy did an excellent job in introducing this character and making the audience realize that his circumstances are the results of the first three Bourne films. The story line is basically the same as the other films.. Bourne must die and we must hunt him down (in this case Aaron Cross). When the last film ended you knew that Treadstone was on its way out and there were drastic measures that were sure to follow. Well, this film is the result of those drastic measures. You know from the trailer that Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) has been genetically enhanced, but they do not tell you much else (which is good). He somehow hooks up with Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) and you start to get that 'I need to find a cure' kind of feeling. To top it all off there is the introduction of a super human, Larx #3 (Louis Ozawa Changchien) who is an emotionless, focused, killing machine. I guess these kinds of 'terminator' characters have become very popular because I saw his would-be female equal just last week in Total Recall. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) was responsible for cleaning up the whole mess and covering up all the evidence of the past. Wow, he should run for office (smile). The entire cast did a good job in delivering the intent of this film including the left over cast members from the previous films (Joan Allen, David Staithaim, etc.). I think they should make one more Bourne film where Aaron Cross runs into Jason Bourne. They should call it The Bourne Reckoning. I don't think that the Bourne series should end without Bourne in it. I know it is not just me. I liked this film well enough, although it was a bit long (over 2 hours). I have always been a longtime fan of the Bourne series so I was not about to stop now. This is a film that would be worth the price of a ticket, if for no other reason than to encourage Matt Damon to come back and finish out this series the right way. I am giving this film a green light.",8,4,11,11 August 2012
Brave," Great 3D and Fun
","I think that what I liked about going to see this film is that although I had seen the trailers many times, I had no clue what the film was going to be about. Initially I guessed that maybe it was about a young woman finding her true love. Boy was I wrong. All I knew was that the animation was going to be great. I heard an interview about this film and one of the directors stated that the most difficult part for the animation team was getting Merida's hair just right. Her hair looked like mine after I've been swimming and it dries naturally. Needless to say it was pretty nappy, but it worked for this film. I wanted to see this film in 3D because the trailer made it look very inviting. When I got to the theater I sat behind a group of young children to gauge their reaction (just in case my inner child had other plans). The kids were totally engaged and did not make a peep during the entire film. This is always a good sign because before the film started they were jabbering away. The animators made Merida and all the other characters very lifelike. This included the persona of a typical teenager and the very small world that they live in (it's all about them). I love the fact that the film is set in the Scottish Highlands and that every now and then when a character spoke, you couldn't tell what the heck he was saying. (That's okay; the characters in the film couldn't understand him either). I would be remiss if I did not mention the mischievous trio of brothers. They had me cracking up and got into all sorts of stuff. This film definitely touches on the mother and daughter bonding experience and ultimately drives home the fact that you have to do what's in your heart to do. When the film was over all the kids in the theater were applauding. Although I do not think that this is one of Pixar's better works, it was definitely enjoyable and worth seeing in 3D. The only caution that I would point out is there is a very scary looking wolf/bear (whatever) that might frighten very young children. I say gather up your brood and go check it out. I do not have to be brave to give this film a Scottish green light.",9,7,14,22 June 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Brilliantly Fun!
","I think that I am going to start this review by saying that I cannot believe that the writer/director of a stinker film like Movie 43 actually also had a hand in writing and directed this film. James Gunn has completely redeemed himself, because Movie 43 was one of the worse films I have ever seen. Guardians of the Galaxy had a great story line and the acting was comical with non-stop action. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is a galaxy scavenger (thief) who goes around collecting stuff that other people have commissioned him to acquire. That being said, he acquires an orb that apparently is very valuable to a lot of people. This sets up the film and the adventure begins. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick Groot (Vin Diesel) are some sort of bounty hunters and soon discovers that someone will pay a lot of money to bring in Peter (and his orb). During the film, the only words that Groot knows how to say are 'I am Groot', but somehow Rocket has learned to understand him by his inflection rather than his words. This makes for a very endearing relationship. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) volunteers to get the orb from Peter and the evil Ronan (Lee Pace) agrees to let her go. The initial scene when all of these characters finally encounter one another was very funny and you kind of get to see what all of them are capable of (as far as fighting ability goes). Drax (Dave Bautista) joins the group shortly after the initial meeting. At first Drax is very self-absorbed and really has his own agenda (pretty much like everyone else), but soon comes to realize that the more the merrier (or whatever). The making of the sequel is already scheduled for 2017. I imagine that we will find out who Peter's father was because that is really the only cliff hanger in this film. Stan Lee made his usual cameo appearance as an elderly playboy (really?). Hell, I guess when you own so many characters you have the right to be whoever the heck you want to be. I recently downloaded an app called 'Run Pee' which tells you when the best time to go to the restroom is during a movie. The app said there is no good time for this film. Maybe while they are running the credits, but come back because we all know how marvel does it. Great film!!!",9,2,4,1 August 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Lights Out
","I am going to go ahead and confess that I have not seen any of the other Twilight films. I guess I am the person that buys the book, but only reads the last chapter (smile). I do have to say that in this case it really did not matter. There is so much publicity about these films that I pretty much know what happened in the other ones, so I really don't feel like I missed much. I don't even think that I needed to see part one of this 2-parter. This film could have stood on its own. I enjoyed all the special effects in the film, but I do have to say that when Renesmee was a new born the CGI kind of reminded me of an E-Trade baby. In this film Bella (Kristen Stewart) is getting used to the idea that she is now a vampire and is starting to flex her super natural powers. She also has to adjust her diet and Edward (Robert Pattinson) has the daunting task of helping her to control some of her now instinctual urges. I have to say that I thought that the vampires would be scarier than they actually were. Even the vampires of the Volturi were not that bad. I do want to say that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) was one big werewolf compared to the other ones. The whole story centers around a rumor gone wild and what can happen if you don't present all the facts. I think that I was a little disappointed because I thought that there would be more action than there was. Just to recap, you do not have to be a Twi-hard fan to see this film. I think that the ending was unexpected. I saw an interview that Kristen Stewart gave and she said that when the film was over, the whole cast did a dance number in the snow. I was hoping that they would put that at the end of the credits, but I am sure that it will pop up sooner or later. Will this film make me want to go back and see the rest of them., no, but I am glad that I saw this one. Some folks that have seen them all say that this is the best one. I can't agree or disagree, but I am going to take their word for it. I was not blown away so I am giving this film an amber light.",5,11,28,16 November 2012
Jack Reacher," This is no Usual Suspects
","I think that director and writer Christopher McQuarrie did a pretty good job on this film, although it is nowhere near the excellent writing that he produced for The Usual Suspects (one of my favorite films). I think that the difference was that in this film there was no element of surprise. I figured out the whole film before it was revealed on screen. And if I figured it out, I know that Emma did since she is more analytical then I am. I have to say that although I was ahead of the film a bit, I still enjoyed seeing it play out. Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is an ex-military drifter who apparently shows up whenever there is injustice with regards to another ex-military sniper. Jack teams up with Helen (Rosamund Pike) to confirm that what happened is the truth and ends up getting more than he bargained for. When I first saw Rosamund on screen, I thought it was Jenna Elfman. They look incredibly alike and I am sure that I am not the only person who thought that. Anyway, Jack seems to get some level of support from unexpected characters. One of those characters is Cash (Robert Duvall) who adds a little comic relief to the film. Emerson (David Oyelowo) heads up the police force, while Rodin (Richard Jenkins) is the District Attorney and Helen's father. There is a sub-story about the volatile relationship between Helen and Rodin. Every time I see Richard on screen I can't help but think about the HBO series Six Feet Under where he played a dead guy. This film had some disturbing violence in the wake of what happened earlier this month. There was a time that the powers that be stopped promoting this film (and for good reason). After you get passed the initial scene, the film tells a pretty good story. The action sequences were really well orchestrated and did add a bit of excitement to the film. I do want to say that Tom plays a lot of these types of characters and I think that I like it better when he steps out of the box a bit, like he did when he was in Rock of Ages. There are a lot of really good films coming out during the holiday season and I am not sure if this is a 'must see', so with that being said, I am giving this film an amber light.",6,5,15,22 December 2012
Les Misérables," Beautifully Done
","I think that the last musical that I saw was Chicago and I really liked it so I thought that I would give this one a shot. Unlike Chicago, where there was some dialog between the songs, that was not the case in this film. There were very few spoken words and it took a little bit of getting used to. The story centers on a convict that had spent 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread and bad behavior. He finally gets paroled and decides to start a new life and violates his parole and becomes a prominent business man. This man is Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who ends up adopting the daughter of a prostitute named Fantine (Anne Hathaway). Javert (Russell Crowe) is the determined inspector that is dead set on hunting him down. All of this is going on at the brink of the beginning of the French Revolution. Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), the little girl that Jean adopts grows up and falls instantly in love with the rebellious revolutionary, Marius (Eddie Redmayne). I thought that I would be kind of bored by the middle of the film, but the film actually gets better. I think that the fact that the singing was done while they were actually shooting the film (instead of being dubbed in), gave the scenes more depth and emotion. The actors acted with an earpiece and there was a guy on the set that played the music in their ear. They added in the 'big' music later. I can see why Anne Hathaway was nominated for a SAG and Golden Globe. She did an outstanding job on the films signature song (I dream a dream). I also want to mention the young actors/singers in the film; Isabelle Allen who played the young Cosette and Daniel Huttlestone who was the miniature revolutionary mascot Gavroche. Both young actors have a bright career ahead of them. This is one of those films that if you love the classics (as I do), then it is definitely a must see. If not, this is one that may change your mind. This was a big story to tell on screen and director Tom Hooper definitely got it right. I know that this is yet another long film, but it is worth it. Although it does indeed contain a lot of misery, I am going to give this film a green light.",9,0,1,27 December 2012
In Time," Chix Chat on Film - Tick Tock
","Let's see.. a film where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. What does that remind me of? Oh yea, the government. Instead of the currency being money, it is time. But in this film it all translates the same. The film illustrated that sometimes if you get too much too soon, it can lead you down a self-destructive path. It also illustrates that the less time you have, the faster you move. There is a lot of running in this film. I kept thinking that if that was me, I would have been caught by now. It also reminded me that I need to hit the gym. I think that writer/director Andrew Niccol did a really good job incorporating the Robin Hood / Bonnie and Clyde theme throughout the film. And although there was some explanation about how things work at the beginning of the film, it really did leave a lot of questions that were not answered. I guess the director did not want to waste our time (smile). I guess that I should talk about Justin Timberlake (Will Salas) a bit. Is there anything that this guy cannot do? He has jumped around film genres like a rabbit in heat. He has gone from bio-pic (Social Network), to comedy (Bad Teacher) and now a full out action star (and a headliner to boot). You go Justin!!! I still want to know when the next album drops (smile). Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia Weis) as the poor little rich girl became more likable as the film progressed. I thought that the chemistry between her and Will was well developed and portrayed. Every time I saw Cillian Murphy (The Timekeeper) on screen, it always reminded me of the nut-job he played in the Batman films. He was one dedicated cop. I think that this film did a good job in showcasing the class warfare that occurs in the future (or is that now I forget). It's really not too different from what is happening today. I do think that some of the editing was a little choppy, but that being said, I thought that the film is definitely worth the time. Although the characters spend a lot of time looking at their watches, you will not be looking at yours. The film was entertaining and I think it is definitely worth spending a little of your time. I give this film a green light (tick tock).",Null,1,8,28 October 2011
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Should have stopped at 3
","Question: How many top entertainers does it take to make an animated film? Answer: Apparently a whole slew of them. I guess the directors of this film thought that the more celebrities, the better the film would be. Not!! But I guess it did make for a pretty decent paycheck. Compared to other animated films of the summer, this one lacks in originality and freshness. I think the lessons that were trying to be conveyed in this film was a little too complicated for the very young crowd that was in the theater with me. The parts of the film that got the most laughs were every time the spotlight was put on Scrat (Chris Wedge). Even in the Ice Age predecessors, he was always the funniest. Maybe it is time for Scrat to get his own film. The young audience did not need dialog they just wanted to laugh. The other character that drew a lot of giggles was Sid (John Leguizamo). Sid along with Granny (Wanda Sykes) was a comedic match made in heaven. I saw an interview that Wanda did and initially she wanted to change her voice to sound older, but the director told her that her voice was perfect for the part. I think that she got a chuckle out of that. I do want to mention Peter Dinklage (Captain Gutt). He seems to be getting a lot of attention since he won a SAG and an Oscar for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones. I have to say that by the end of the film I grew a little weary of Captain Gutt. He was really starting to get on my last nerve. Peaches (Keke Palmer) was a typical teenager that had to deal with peer pressure, parental rules and misguided decision making. The hate/love relationship that built between Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez) did manage to give the film a little extra punch, but not much. The film wasn't all bad. There were a few laughs; however this franchise has been saturated. I definitely think that it is time to put this one to bed. I think that very young viewers will appreciate the animation and maybe pre-teens will get the message, but this film was not designed to do both. All that being said, I am going to have to give this film a mammoth amber light.",4,48,79,15 July 2012
Dark Shadows," Will Suck the Life Out of You
","I guess I will start out by saying that I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and that I even like some of Tim Burton's works (Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas). However, that being said, I did not like this film all that much. If you are looking for some comedy in this film, then go and watch the trailer, because most of the funny parts are in it. I understand that this film was supposed to be a spoof of the soap opera that appeared in the 1970's, but it really fell short of my expectations. I remember being in elementary school and rushing home to see what was happening on Dark Shadows. In this film, not only did I not want to see what happens next, I really didn't care. Johnny Depp (Barnabas Collins) once again embraced his character and does a really fine job of making the character believable, but the content just wasn't there. I don't think that this film ever decided what it wanted to be when it grew up. There were elements of comedy, horror, drama and even a little romance. There was some jostling around in this film between Barnabas and Angelique (Eva Green), but you could almost sense the wires that the actors were tied to. And is it just me or does Bella Heathcote (Victoria Winters/Josette DuPres) look a little like Anne Hathaway? Victoria and David Collins (Gulliver McGrath) gave a whole new meaning to the phrase 'I see dead people'. I guess my favorite character in the film was Willie (Jackie Earle Haley) who was Barnabas' sidekick. He was fun to watch even though he did not have many lines (thank goodness). This film may end up sucking the life out of your expectations. By the time you get to the end of the film, things get downright silly and stupid. The last ten minutes of the film I kept thinking to myself .. oh brother. Also at the end of the film there was almost a hint of a sequel; man I sure hope not. Not all of the Depp/Burton collaborations have been successful and this is one of them. If you just want to see Johnny Depp on the big screen, then by old means go. However I think that this film should be locked in a box (redbox). As sure as my blood is red, so is the light for this film.",3,140,283,11 May 2012
Prometheus," Prequel.... You Decide
","It has been 30 years since Ridley Scott has dabbled in this genre and I have to say that I am glad that he is back. A lot of things that I am going to say in this review are going to sound negative, but I want to say right up front that I liked this film. Mr. Scott said in an interview that he hasn't done a Science Fiction film since Blade Runner because he could not find a script that he liked. Apparently he just dusted off the Alien script and restructured it a bit. I saw the film in 3D, but I don't think that it was really necessary. The visual effects in this film just didn't require it. The sets were over the top along with the CGI. It has also been stated that this film is not meant to be a prequel to the Alien films .. whatever!!! It sure looked like one to me. I think that the whole premise of trying to find out where we came from was pretty interesting and not too far-fetched since there is now several television shows geared toward explaining the unexplainable by attaching the possibility that aliens have visited this planet before. Towards the end of the film I found myself shaking my head (smh) a lot. The physicality by Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) was so incredibly unbelievable, especially after all the stuff that she had been through. I don't think so. The android David (Michael Fassbender) was very stoic and vacant (which I guess that is how a robot should be). I was once again shaking my head when some of the scenes had me thinking 'where have I seen this before'. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) was almost as robotic as David as she represented the company financing this little venture. Janek (Indris Elba) and his crew was the voice of reason in this journey into the vastness of outer space. If you are an Alien fan, then you will be a fan of this film. There were some parts of the film that were slightly gruesome, but you come to expect that with this type of film. I have been a fan of monster movies every since Godzilla first graced the screen and this film reinforced my loyalty to the genre. This is one of those times that I wish we had a light between green and amber, but I'm going to stick my neck out and give it an orbiting green light.",8,3,5,8 June 2012
Taken 2," More of the Same
","I am going to start out by saying that Taken 2 was not as good as Taken, but the film did manage to tie the two together. Not only that but they left it open for yet another sequel. Not sure that is a good idea. There was plenty of action and the basic premise remained the same as the first. The film did demonstrate how small the streets are in Istanbul. Some of the driving scenes were utterly ridiculous and so unbelievable that they left me shaking my head. The fight scenes were well choreographed but by the time you get to the end of the film, they just started getting way too long. As identified in the trailer, once again someone is kidnapped. My question is why? If this film is about revenge, why not just shoot them; but that's just me. I have to say that Liam Neesom (Bryan Mills) is in pretty good shape to take on the physicality of this role. His character is as stoic as ever, however there are moments that you get to see the more tender side of him. I was not used to seeing Famka Janssen (Lenore) in such a vulnerable role. There was a voice in my head yelling, 'get up already.. You're the Phoenix for goodness sake'. I think that she played the role the way it was meant to be played but I am not sure she was the right choice. Maggie Grace (Kim) as Bryan's daughter had the responsibility of delivering some of the pivotal moments in the film. They were just so outlandish that it once again had me shaking my head. Rade Serbedzija (Murad Krasniqi) was the kingpin of a multitude of bad guys. It was difficult to believe that you could run around and do as much damage as he did and not warrant the authorities crashing down on your head. All in all the film did keep my attention, it's just that it was a regurgitation of the first film, so I would expect that if there is another it will be more of the same. I really like Liam as an actor, but I hope that he can put this franchise to rest. I would like to see him branch out a little more like he did in Nell. Is it worth the price of a ticket? I'm not so sure, so I'm leaving it in your hands. I give this film an amber light.",7,2,8,5 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight DEFINITELY Rises
","The question you have to ask yourself is this film worth getting butt blisters over because it is a long one. The answer is undeniably, YES. Director Christopher Nolan did an excellent job wrapping up the Batman trilogy by brilliantly incorporated the first two films into this film. There were a few moments when I caught myself thinking 'get on with it already', but other than that I was thoroughly entertained. This film did solidify for me that Batman is just an ordinary guy with lots of really cool gadgets. All the situations that Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) was put into only enhanced the fact that he is a mere mortal. This includes the emotional turmoil and the physicality of his character. The introduction of Selina/Cat Woman (Anne Hathaway) was expertly introduced into the story. Selina was as unpredictable as ever and by the middle of the film you really don't know if you like her or hate her (which is the way her personality was designed). Bane (Tom Hardy) was one of the most evil 'bad guy' ever to be portrayed on screen. He was ruthless and determined to put an end to Gotham's existence. The only predictable character for me was the introduction of Blake (Joseph Gordan-Levitt). Commissioner Gordan (Gary Oldman) took him under his wing almost immediately which would ultimately define Blake's future. Fox (Morgan Freeman) was up to his old tricks and continued his development of new toys for Bruce to play with, while Alfred (Michael Caine) caught me off guard with some unexpected dialog. This film did have some really great plot twists which caught me by surprise. The Dark Knight definitely deserved some redemption after the last film (The Dark Knight) and Christopher Nolan (along with Jonathan Nolan) ensured that he got it. This is one of the best action films that I have seen this year with a rich storyline and unmatched acting. I would put this right up there with The Avengers. I know that this is Mr. Nolan's last Batman venture, however there is no doubt in my mind that the character will live on and we will all see him again. This is absolutely a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and is worth the price of a ticket. I will be adding this one to my DVD collection. I give this film a glaring green light. Note: I would like to express my sympathy to the families of the victims in the Aurora shooting. My heart goes out to you and I will keep you in my prayers.",9,3,9,21 July 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," A Youthful Joy
","This quirky story about young love is very charming and captures genuine feelings. In order to claim their adoration of each other, these two young people have to escape their tumultuous lives to find happiness. I have to say that I think this is one of Director Wes Anderson's better works. As soon as the film begins, you get a sense that you may be at an independent film festival screening a film that may not have gotten the attention that it deserves. I only saw brief trailers of this film before going to see it, but the reason that I did go was because of its rich cast of characters. I have to first mention the two virtual unknowns who are responsible for playing the lead roles. Kara Hayward (Suzy) and Jared Gilman (Sam) are adorable in their roles. Both characters are pretty much wallflowers and not considered 'normal' in their world, but function beautifully together. The dedication and loyalty that they display for one another is touching and endearing. Suzy is fearless and gives off the impression that if she puts her mind to it she can accomplish anything. Sam is super intelligent and is just fed up with trying to conform to everyone else's whims. The supporting cast reads like a who's who list. Bruce Willis (Captain Sharp) is the lone police officer in this secluded area of our planet and has the ultimate responsibility of locating our two traveling lovers. Edward Norton (Scout Master Ward) is an over-the-top troop master who runs his young troops like Patton must have run his army. Bill Murray (Walt Bishop) is Suzy's somewhat dysfunctional father who is not only battling with the disappearance of his daughter, but also with a situation that develops with his wife Laura (Frances McDormand). Tilda Swinton (Social Services) along with Harvey Keitel (Commander Pierce) completes this amazing cast. With all the huge blockbusters out this summer it is refreshing to see a film that has a consistent storyline with no big bells and whistles. This off-beat film takes me back to my childhood when there were times that I wanted to escape and exile myself to a Moonrise Kingdom. This film is truly magical and deserves more credit than it is being given. Wes Anderson has brought himself back to form. Finally a film that you don't need 3D glasses to view. I am giving this film a green light.",8,4,7,22 July 2012
Flight," Buckle up, folks
","When I first saw the preview for this film I had no intention on seeing it. I already have panic attacks every time I know that I am going to have to fly somewhere. I was feeling every bit of turbulence that the folks on the plane were feeling. I hate to fly and this film did nothing to sway my concerns in this mode of travel. As shown in the trailer, at some point the airplane is actually flying upside down. At that point I would no longer need to worry because I would be dead of a heart attack. Although this film centers on the plane crash event, it is not the main focus of the film. The main focus centers around pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) and the issues that he is dealing with. Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood) and Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) arrive on the scene and try to help mitigate the situation, but they become enablers just like almost everyone else in the film. I think that there were two bright spots in the film. The first one was Derek Hogue (Dane Davenport), who is a guy dealing with cancer and has gained a whole new perspective on life. The second character was Harling Mays (John Goodman) who is what can only be described as a closer. He was hilarious. Margaret Thomason (Tamara Tunie) played a huge part in saving the majority of the passengers on the plane although her participation was not acknowledged in the film. I think that the writers kind of dropped the ball a little bit here. I just want to say that I have always wanted to get a sneak peak at Denzel's backside but now that I've seen it, it was really no big deal. The film was definitely good enough to hold your attention although it was longer than it needed to be. There was no real surprises in this film and it was pretty predictable from beginning to end, but I think that director Robert Zemeckis did an excellent job telling this story. For those of us who are fearful of flying, this film will just add to your anxiety and it puts yet another scenario in your head of what could happen as you're cruising at 30,000 feet, but I say, turn off all your electrical devices and buckle down and go and see this film. I give it a green light.",8,18,37,3 November 2012
Pitch Perfect," Mildly Amusing
","In Pitch Perfect director Jason Moore makes and attempt to step away from the small screen (e.g. Dawson's Creek, Everwood) and onto the big screen with this very predictable and mildly entertaining film. I really wanted this film to be funnier than it was. All the good parts were depicted in the trailer, so there is really not a whole lot forward to. The one scene in the trailer that did not make the cut was the car wash scene (which I thought would have been hilarious). There was some repetitiveness that made me think, 'not this song again'. The story centers on a singing competition of a Capella groups. The girls group contains mean girls, weird girls, crazy girls and girls of all shapes and sizes. The film is mostly about an aspiring DJ, Beca (Anna Kendrick) whose dream it is to ultimately move to Los Angeles and fulfill her dreams; however she must become more socially involved in order to do this. So she decides to give the Barden Bellas a shot. By far the standout in this film is Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). She is the reason that I wanted to see this film in the first place and she did not disappoint. Rebel was on the Ellen show earlier this week and I have to say that she is hilarious. There are some people who and act funny and then there are people who are funny; she is the latter. She first caught my eye when she played Brynn in Bridesmaid. Jesse (Skylar Astin) and Beca's roller-coaster relationship adds a little more content to the film and depicts a typical college relationship. Best friends Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp) are responsible for assembling a new team for the upcoming school year. Aubrey is quickly stamped as the mean girl and has some serious issues in this film. I was surprised to see Donald Faison in this film. I was like, 'hey, that's the guy from Scrubs'. I do not think that Pitch Perfect was a bad film. I think that the teens out there will actually enjoy this film and can probably relate to it. Also, some of the music numbers were really good. It just didn't have enough substance for me. With all that being said, I am not sure that this film is worth the price of a ticket. I am going to give this film an amber light.",6,2,6,5 October 2012
Looper," Looper is a Winner
","I think that I am going to start out by saying that it is very difficult to surprise me at a film. They are usually very predictable. I have to say that this film got me (which I love). Director/Writer Rian Johnson did a very good job explaining what a Looper was right from the beginning. Just when I was asking myself 'what if' questions in my head, they were being answered right there before me. If you go to this film expecting a lot of futuristic special effects, there aren't many, but the storyline did not suffer because of it. Although this film pretty much centers around regret and redemption, there are splashes of sacrifice and lost love. As expected there was a lot of retro-vision (my made up word), but they were very well placed. The transformation of Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) into his older self (Bruce Willis) was expertly demonstrated. I think that the casting of these two look-alike actors was brilliant. Abe (Jeff Daniels) was the futuristic mob boss and the controlling force behind the loopers. As seen in the trailer, Joe fails to eliminate his older self and the cat and mouse game begins. Abe is relentless in his pursuit of both versions of Joe. Sara (Emily Blunt) is a single mom just trying to survive and raise her son in a very hostile world. I would be remiss if I did not mention Cid (Pierce Gagnon). You find yourself really falling for this kid, even though there are many things transpiring with him. You really don't know the significance of Beatrix (Tracie Thoms), who is a waitress in a local diner, until the end of the film. This mind-bending science fiction film has the viewer wondering about all the possibilities that could have developed in the film. I think that I would put this film in the mystery category as well. Just when you think that you have it all figured out, you don't. Although at times this film did have a terminator feel to it, I was blown away by the end of the film. There were a lot of times that I said to myself, 'I didn't see that coming'. Even without stunning special effects, this film is definitely worth the price of a ticket. You will not regret it. I recommend that you close the loop and go and see this film. I give it a glaring green light.",9,6,25,28 September 2012
50_50," Chix Chat on Film (Catt) Reviews 50/50
","From the trailer you would think that this film was a comedy about cancer, but you would be seriously wrong. Although there were some very funny lines in the film, this film gets realistic really quick. Being that it is based on a true story, the lead character, Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) very quickly became very endearing. The story emphasizes that although you can follow all the rules, be a nice guy and treat people with respect, you can still get cancer. I really liked Joseph in Inception, but I liked him even more in this film. I think that he captured the essence of the fear that ensues when those dreadful words come roaring out of your doctor's mouth. Once again Bryce Dallas Howard (Rachael) is strapped with the mean-girl role. She was not quite as mean as she was in The Help, but if there is one person that you want to hate in this film, it is her. Hopefully she will not be type-cast and can get out and spread her wings a bit. Seth Rogan (Kyle) turns out to be a true friend. He is the type of friend that I hope that I have should the occasion arise. Seth was responsible for adding some light-heartedness to this otherwise dismal film and he did an exceptional job. The rest of the cast also pulled at your heart-strings with everyone having their own challenges in their lives. Diane (Anjelica Huston), Adam's mom was the typical concerned mom who was also dealing with her husband Richard's (Serge Houde) situation. I am not sure if I could ever be as strong as she had to be in this film. I guess you just have to deal with things as things arise and roll with the punches. Katherine (Anna Kendrick) was a pleasant addition to the cast as the sometime bumbling psychologist. This film was just as much about relationships as it was about dealing with cancer. The scriptwriter, Will Reiser was brilliant in understanding just the right things to say at exactly the right time. Hopefully this will get him out of the shadows of his cousin, Paul Reiser. There was not one minute that I felt bored or uninterested, but I do not think that this is a 'must-see' film, even though it did make me laugh out loud and made me shed more than just a few tears. I am giving this film a very, very bright amber light.",Null,0,3,30 September 2011
Cloud Atlas," Reincarnation at it's best
","I am going to start off by saying that I was very excited to see this film. The trailer made it look so interesting and engaging. I think that there is a certain fascination with reincarnation that will draw folks in to see this film, whether you believe in it or not. I expected the film to flow seamlessly from one life to another; that was not the case. I recommend that you drink a red bull and wear something comfortable before you purchase that ticket. There are two main points that I want to make.. One is that the film is a hodgepodge of mini stories that keeps hopping around (hence the red bull). The second point is that this film is long; really long (hence the comfortable clothes). By the time this film was over I was more than ready to get out of there. With all that being said, the film did have some beautiful scenery, but I spent most of the time trying to relate the cast of characters from one life to the next life. Normally in these reviews I would write about the actors and their characters, but that will be difficult to do in this case since all the main actors play so many different roles, so I will just write about what I felt like were the main ones. Plus, I don't want to ruin the fun for the rest of you. The film begins and ends with Zackry (Tom Hanks). When first introduced you are not quite sure if he is from the past or from the future, but all is revealed in the end. Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) is an investigative reporter (among other roles) who is trying to follow in her father's footsteps by uncovering a major injustice in the oil industry. Sonmi-451 (Doona Bae) is the most endearing character. I was rooting for her all the way throughout the film, although when she showed up again in the 1700s, I was a little bit surprised. There are a whole lot of actors that I can mention, but it would be too exhausting. I will say this. This film is an excellent test of acting skills and stretches the actors in all kinds of directions. The question is whether or not this film is worth getting butt blister to see. I am teetering between amber and green, but I am going to go with a green light just because the subject matter is so engaging.",8,4,15,27 October 2012
