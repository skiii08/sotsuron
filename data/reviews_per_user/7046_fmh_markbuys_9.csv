Ford v Ferrari," You feel and taste the adrenaline!
","The movie Le Mans '66 is based on a actual happened story. In a nutshell, the Ford motor company was in the market to buy Ferrari in the early 60's However Ferrari utilized the offer of Ford to get an even better offer from FIAT. An unexpected strategic move which pissed off Henry Ford II in that way, he wanted to take revenge on Ferrari by beating their cars on the black side where Ferrari was dominant for years in a row. So therefore the race engineering group Shelby got involved in order to design and construct the perfect race-car which is able to put an end to Ferrari and its years of overwhelming victory force.
The key-players in this movie are Matt Damon who plays Shelby and Christian Bale who plays Ken Miles.
Le Mans 66 is showing in a somehow funny way how the Ford GT40 was re-invented and perfected for racing at Daytona and finally Le Mans. Funny to see how racing was done back in the good old days and how things got so changed throughout the years. For instance: the pitlane was not separated by a big wall at Le Mans, but was actually on the racetrack. Safety features such as.....which safety features??! In those days racing cars were designed with paper and pencil and constructed with hammer and screwdrivers, no robotics or any micromanagement tooling. Analysis of race data was done by engineers and racing drivers, not computers.
In the movie Le Mans 66 you feel like you are actually in the 60's. You feel the power of a 7ltr engine, the adrenaline rush of the drivers you can taste yourself. The only thing missing is the smell of gasoline and of exhausts. I say: Great movie!!!!",9,1,2,30 November 2019
Creed," Creed, Rocky continues...
","Another movie with Sylvester Stallone means another movie in my DVD and blue ray collection! And this movie continues one of the best movies I liked the most, Rocky! Rocky starts to train the son of Apollo Creed. A young kid with the spirit of his late daddy and the hunger what Rocky had. A great movie! A movie of this time. But also a movie which shows that Sylvester Stallone aka Rocky Balboa is getting older! Now in true life this fighter has passed all qualifications for a well deserved rest in a retirement home. How ever Sly does go on! But in Creed Rocky is treated for cancer and keeps on fighting! Great movie, great acting, just loved to watch this one!",10,1,3,17 August 2016
Shutter Island," your mind is going crazy
","Leonardo plays in Shutter Island the role of a U.S. Marshall somewhere in the early 50's. Together with his partner Leonardo investigates the disappearance on of the psychiatric inmates who lives on the island.Shutter Island is an island which looks like Alcatraz. An island which can only be visited by boat, is surrounded by miles of ice cold sea water, razor sharp cliffs etc...While doing his investigation, Leonardo is constantly thrown back in time during WW2 killing German soldiers. But also he sees his wife who is actually dead.Shutter island is a movie which you need to watch, to understand and surprise yourself about the outcome!",8,0,1,4 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Rise of Disney
","The Rise of SkywalkerThis Star Wars movie is supposed to be the last out of nine movies. And no, let's not include the side stories or the life stories of certain characters.
I believed the saga ended after chapter six, however once Disney got involved, the saga continued. Of course, Star Wars is a science fiction phantasy movie. In other words, you can share any thoughts on the white screen, as long you come up with a story that other people are willing to believe. George Lucas was pretty successful to share his thoughts in the first six movies, however movie seven & eight and especially number nine, The Rise of Skywalker, the thoughts were Disney minded. The only part missing is that big Disney castle in Florida and Mickey Mouse standing on top of the roof of the castle.Star Wars sells tickets, merchandise like toys, outfits, brands, you name it. Star Wars makes money. And part nine for sure will sell very nicely. However to go back to the movie. The story of The Rise of Skywalker is vague and basically in some way a copy of part six, but presented with a different twist. There is no Death Star available with the size of planet Mars, there are no real visible dark-side opponents such as Darth Vader or that chap which looks he has been overcooked. Kylo Ren is at least no member of any party.
This time the emperor himself comes up with an armada of star destroyers. More than you ever think off, the screen is full of star-destroyers. But all those star destroyers are at the end controlled by just one little command tower. And at the end of course all destroyed. The rebellion all in a sudden have mobilized the whole galaxy (and beyond) in order to attack the empire, I mean the First Order, I mean the Final Order. But it is the emperor who has so much power and force which enables him to control everything and almost to destroy anyone who gets in his way.Just as vague as I describe this movie, just as vague Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker is also.",5,1,3,4 January 2020
Dunkirk," The realism of Dunkirk....
","Last weekend we went to the cinema to see the movie Dunkirk. Our expectations were high because of many positive stories of people who already seen this movie. However, we were somehow disappointed after we saw this movie.In my honest opinion this movie does not tell the true story of what really happened at Dunkirk and what really went on with all the men desperitaly trying to leave France.Some scenes played next to each other but in a different time level. This made the movie difficult to follow. Also a plane without fuel which was able to stay mid-air for a considerable amount of time able to shoot enemy planes down, was so un-realistic.At least it was a movie where blood wasn't spilled as there was hardly any blood visible. Even though the bombs went down on thousands of soldiers, no blood or any lost parts of bodies were seen.Too bad that Dunkirk is not shown as it really was, however it is a good thing that events like Dunkirk are recorded. So people get a fairly good idea how WWII started.",6,3,4,1 August 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Not bad at all
","Pirates of the Caribbean were never dull movies to look at. A good picture of how it was a couple of hunderds of years ago in the world of Piracy. Combined with a twist of humor Pirates of the Caribbean were created. Quite honestly I thought after the third movie this movies stopped, but no. A fourth movie was made and even better now: the fifth movie has started: Salazar's revenge. What a movie! Great shots, great special effects and another great story. What I love the most is that most of the Original actors of the first movie have returned in this one. If you are looking for action, good sense of humor and you have a lot of fantasy, then Pirates ofthe Caribbean: Salazar's revenge is one for your list to see!",8,6,18,26 May 2017
The Departed," Great action movie!
","The actors of Departed are a combination of well known actors: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon etc.
All actors have their own way of acting. Jack Nicholson is able to act almost everything. If it is a nutcase, a Joker or even a full grown top gangster, Jack Nicholson is able to do this role. The same goes for Leonardo and Damon and all the others. I like the combination of these actors in this movie.A couple of youngsters who have successfully graduated the police academy and the FBI academy, are ready for the job. However there is one little angle. These youngsters do have attachments to the local mafia ran by Jack Nicholson.
The state police as well as the FBI are more than willing to put Jack away, whether that is behind bars or 6 ft down below, that doesn't really matter. What matters is, is that peace and justice will return.Like any other American movie where multiple federal police forces are involved (CIA, FBI, State police, DEA) they all have one thing in common. These forces should be on the same side, but at the end they fight amongst each other. The same in this movie (Ok, CIA and DEA are not involved).If you are looking for a good action movie, the Departed will for sure not let you down!",9,2,4,26 August 2019
Creed II," Creed II is awesome!!!!
","Creed II is out in cinema in Holland since 2nd week of 2019. And what a movie to start the year with! Great movie from beginning till the end. Rocky combined with a little bit of drama, family and music.Sylvester Stallone is older now, but definitely not done for. And was able to set another movie of which the outcome was not to be expected at all. So great!",10,0,0,12 January 2019
Up in the Air," George in his upmost
","George Clooney in a role to be hired as some kind of a interim manager and is capable of firing complete departments of companies. On the other hand George is active as speaker for business and conventions. Most of the time George spends his time travelling around the USA by flying in planes, staying in hotels and renting cars.George, also known as the Nespresso man, is a well distinguished character who has seen it all. But at some point his own company wants to change the way of working by using digital technology such digital conferencing, skype that sort of stuff. Also George meets a very special woman he fells in love with. And the last major change is a new colleague, young, attractive and with all sorts of ideas.
Not only this movie represents the hard ice-cold way of working of the USA. After twenty years of service, the next day you are out of a job, 'we have to let you go'. This movie also gives a pretty good overview how the Americans deal with these kind of situations.Going back to George, George was excellent in this movie. In my opinion George can get better movies, but that's for later concern.",7,0,0,26 August 2019
