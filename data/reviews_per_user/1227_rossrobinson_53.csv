I think that movie will blast again of the 2000's, it's going to be one hell of a good movie, i hope it pulls out well with lots of people telling themselves and others what a fantastic movie it is, The movie is coming out in August. I think Arnold Swarznegger is a fantastic actor, he played a fantastic part in predator and has done other fantastic movies besides predator, movies such as Conan the barbarian, The Terminator, Commando, running man, twins, terminator 2: judgement day, total recall, kindergartan cop, Eraser, collateral damage, end of days, terminator 3: rise of the machines, Now theses days i think he would done great movies because his time i think has now passed as he is the governer of california.

The Matrix Revolutions," Brillant
","The Matrix Revolutions has got to be a great movie to end the Matrix Trilogy. Although i think this is the least best because i thought the actors and actresses made this movie a type with no much type of action (Like more fighting and the slow motion) I feel that they got on with this and made this one a quickie one because they made the last 2 Matrix movies (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) in the same year (2003) Matrix Reloaded was released in the uk cinemas in May 2003 and then 6 months later in November 2003 they brought out Matrix Revolutions. To make 2 movies in one years that is popular with the first in a trilogy, i would think they would crack on with it and try not to make as much mistakes. I did like The Matrix Revolutions and i thought it had a great ending to end the the Trilogy. I give the movie 10 out of 10. I would think that this last movie would have been spent on less than the other 2 previous Matrix movies because i think they wanted to do the best scenes first, like in Matrix Reloaded, the creators spend a massive 150 Million on one scene which brought the movie to an amazing one. It's a fantastic Trilogy to watch, all 3 martix movies, they are amazing to watch. Fantastic.",10,0,1,27 March 2004
