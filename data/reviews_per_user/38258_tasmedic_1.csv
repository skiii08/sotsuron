It," IT = Gandalf with a red nose
","Apparently, IT can appear anywhere in the blink of an eye, which has nothing at all to do with the drainage system of the town. A bit like Gandalf, really. Can crop up at any stage for no reason at all. Just one of many, many deviations from what was an excellently crafted written work. This film simply doesn't stack up to the book, and is not well enough made to justify all the inadequacies. A complete waste of time.",1,5,9,15 October 2018
