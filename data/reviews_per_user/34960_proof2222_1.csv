Scarface," A Work of Art
","Not only is Al Pacino's contribution to the film as an artist magnificent, as one of his most outstanding role interpretations. The film as a whole is timeless. The whole cast is outstanding and every moment is accounted for. Shows with deliberate proof that directors do have they moments in artistic manifestos. Just as painters have done some of their best works. The American dream is everyone's secret fantasy and Al takes it to the maximus. This is the type of film that keeps Hollywood alive because of it's timelessness. Few films have such an impact and this is mos def - one of the few.",10,0,1,4 February 2003
