Scarface," The greatest film ever made!!!!!!!!!!
","In my opinion, this is the greatest film of all time. It is my favourite all time film. Al Pacino gives the greatest performance of all time in this film. He plays the ruthless gangster Tony Montana (aka Scarface). The only film that has come very close to this one, is Martin Scorseses amazing masterpiece Goodfellas (that is my opinion).Michelle Pfeiffer gives the best performance of her acting career as the lonely wife of Tonys. Steven Bauer gives a brilliant performance as Tonys best friend Manny. He provides the films most upsetting scene when Tony kills hims. I know Tony felt betrayed by manny sleeping with Tonys sister, but murder was WAY out of the line. Manny actually loved his sister so they could of had a great future together. Tonys sister Gina is played excellently by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Robert Loggia portrays Frank Lopez amazingly. The entire cast is amazing. Paul Gives a scary performance as the evil Alex Sosa.The film is very anti-drugs. It does not glorify cocaine use at all!!! It also has many social messages that any cocaine user should check out. The film stormed a huge amount of controversy upon its initial release. Hardly any film critics gave the film a positive review. I am grateful that Roger Ebert gave the film a full star rating though. He is the most important film critic in my mind. The film was originally rated X by the MPAA. Director Brian De Palma had to censor the film three times. All received X ratings. In the end he brought in a huge panel of experts to view the film and in the end the vote was 18 to 2 of getting the third cut a R rating. However, Brian De Palm submitted the full uncut version with the R rating to Universal, and since they didn't know the difference between the uncut version and the censorsed version, he submitted the full uncut edition.Buy the big 2 disc special edition of this film. The bonus disc contain a 3 part behind the scenes documentary about the detailed history of them remaking Scarface, hiring the cast and the aftermath. There is a short documentary on the TV version of Scarface. Most of the swearing was dubbed over by pointless words which actually made the film really funny and most of the violence was also cut. There is a documentary on how important the film has been in the Hip Hop world. Many famous hip op artists appear in this documentary. It is excellent. There are also loads of deleted scenes (some which are actually quite good). and trailers.I haven't seen the original but I love this film!!! Oliver Stone, great script.BBFC Consumer advice: rated 18 for strong language, sex references, bloody violence and hard drug use.",10,0,2,24 June 2011
Goodfellas," This truly is one of the greatest movies ever made!!
","Goodfellas is my second favourite all time film. Just after Scarface. This film is just absolutely brilliant. I originally watched Goodfellas back in the late 90s when my dad had an old VHS of it. I fell in love with the film right there and then. I didn't get the DVD until by birthday in 2010. Unfortunately, it was the annoying double sided disc. You get the first 70 minutes of the film on one side, and the last 70 minutes on the other. This means you have to flip the disc over half way through which is really irritating. You half to take the disc out, turn it around and then put it back in just after the sequence where Tommy kills Spider. I haven't got the 2 disc edition yet, but I really want it. The film was inspired by true story and is also based on the book Wiseguys by Nicholas Pileggi. He co wrote the script with the director of this masterpiece Martin Scorsese.Ray Liotta gives his greatest performance in this film as the lead character Henry Hill. He is just absolutely brilliant. The sequence where he has to break the wall at the end of the film and talk to the camera was just brilliant. Robert De Niro gives one amazing performance as well as the infamous gangster Jimmy Conway. However, it is Joe Pesci who steals this movie. He is just absolutely terrifying as Tommy DeVito. Definitely someone you don't want to mess with. The way he just shoots Spider in the foot and later on kills him was scary. This is because he just acts like there is nothing wrong with his actions. Joe Pesci won a rightly deserved academy award for this film. I think he does just as good, if not even better as Nicky Santoro in another Martin Scorsese masterpiece Casino.Lorraine Bracco gives a great performance in this film as well as Karen Hill. She scares the hell out of me every time she shouts. Another amazing actor in this film is Paul Sorvino who plays Paul Cicero (Paulie). There are several scenes of brutal violence in this film but don't worry its nothing to disturbing. The sequence where Henry bashes the face in of a man who tried to rape his wife is sick. Another shocking sequence is when Tommy and Jimmy beat the living hell out of Billy Batts who is played very well by Frank Vincent.Goodfellas stands the test of time as being one of the greatest films ever made. If you are going to purchase the DVD then get the full 2 disc edition. I heard you get two audio commentaries and several documentaries. The choices of the music in this film is absolutely brilliant. It truly is the second greatest film ever made. (P.S. the film also contains around 300 F words).BBFC consumer advice: Rated 18 for strong language, bloody violence and hard drug use.",10,1,2,29 June 2011
