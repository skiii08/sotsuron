The Lobster," Unfunny Dark Comedy
","After watching the trailer for The Lobster, I decided to watch it. It felt like a quirky, off beat comedy with a main character who is socially awkward, looking for love. But what I found instead was a movie that dealt with themes of fascism, conformity, oppression, suicide, loss of personal identity, and frankly a depressing soundtrack.The lesser offense in this movie is the over-narration, which spoon feeds facts to the viewer as we see them happening on screen much like Idiocracy, only this time it's serious and not a joke. Please stop narrating movies and let the viewer experience the journey along with the characters. Stop the spoon feeding.The greater offense to this film involves two instances of animal cruelty that was enough to turn my stomach and end this movie half way through.This movie is not a comedy, rather a pitch black dark comedy.",3,10,16,19 December 2015
The Machinist," Poorly executed and weak.
","Here we see another post-fight club surprise ending movie that really fails to deliver the goods. Christian Bale is fantastic to the point of scaring me because he lost so much weight, and his acting is as good as ever, but everything surrounding him was less than enthusiastic. The basics of this movie rest in one part Memento, one part Fight Club and one part Jacob's Ladder. Extract the climax of those fine films and insert cheesy 1960s science fiction background music, and we're set to roll. As this movie progressed I was struggling to piece things and people together and by the end of it I had mentally written two alternative solutions that were far better than the one they gave us. If this movie came out in the early to mid 1990s it would have blown me away, but I'm afraid my expectations for surprise endings are higher these days, and this overall didn't deliver the goods. At best this movie should be recut for television and have it aired as a Twilight Zone and/or X-files movie of the week. 2/10 stars.",Null,1,2,9 November 2004
Big Fish," Awkward Forrest Gump Wannabe
","I've been a fan of Tim Burton ever since Pee Wee's Big Adventure was released on VHS and have followed him through his many genre hopping, each time finding something wonderful, quirky and twisted to share with others and marvel over. Case in point; Beetlejuice. Nuff Said. Like most people I was amazed at how mature Burton's take was on Planet Of The Apes, and the timeline twist blew me away. I was set up for a great Big Fish experience, only to be shot in the foot with a piece of awkward garbage. It feels as though Burton compromised his vision to accomplish something that was forced upon him by the studio. That's right. Forced. Nothing flowed in this movie, everything felt awkward and unnatural. The movie's only saving grace was the acting of Helena Bonham Carter and Albert Finney. I felt sorry for Karl the Giant as the actor who plays him must live with the great deal of discomfort. The movie had it's moments which leaves me sitting on the fence. Two and half stars out of five. Rent a backup movie so you don't feel obligated to watch this.",Null,0,1,6 November 2004
The Truman Show," The Prisoner
","Filmed in Florida's town of Celebration, The Truman show reminds me of the BBC series 'The Prisoner'. A man fighting to reclaim his own freedom from those unseen forces keeping him captive. I've never got tired of this movie, the performances, the humour, the social engineering. The overall themes seem to ring true for all of us at one point in our lives or another. Watching this movie I felt myself identifying with Truman, and I suspect most people do, because he too works and lives a predictable lifestyle that he yearns to get away from and have an adventure. Ed Harris' performance is astounding. I felt for him just as much as I did for Truman, and I think that's the beauty of this picture. Knowing that we're seeing all sides to the story and not just one perspective is unusual for a movie that typically revolves around one main character. Without question I give this movie five stars. The soundtrack is good too.",Null,0,0,6 November 2004
