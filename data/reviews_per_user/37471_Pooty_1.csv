Deja Vu," Horrible attempt at time travel
","Dear God...Can't these people realize that time travel requires a small amount of thought? This film was a horrendous mess. Horrendous. I can't even begin to explain how the time travel aspects were brushed over, and how the special effects took prescience over what should truly matter in a film such as this - The plot.How dare they pretend that someone could tamper with something as sensitive as 'Time', and have an absolute disrespect for the physics of the nature.Take a serious moment out of your day, and walk/drive to your local Blockbuster (hell; get it online) and rent the film 'Primer'. Best film I've seen in 10 years, done for 1/100 the budget, and had the wherewithal to stand the test of time.Overall rating: 3/10",3,0,1,16 July 2007
