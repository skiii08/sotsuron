Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolutely hilarious
","This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It's a shame that many people that have commented on this have completely missed the point. Contextually there is almost nothing offensive about this film. Well, perhaps that's not true. But it is amazingly funny. Literally I was laughing every couple of seconds, it's that good. Not often does a film come out that keeps you laughing all the time.. but this has managed it. It's probably the biggest continuous laugh since Blazing Saddles.Some of the stuff that's featured is literally, unreal. The hotel scene is perhaps the funniest thing I've ever seen. It's shocking but my word, it's funny.I'm impressed at the number of US reviewers who have seen the funny side of this film and can take someone taking the mick.. rather than being offended.Did you see what was in the fridge?",10,1,13,16 April 2007
