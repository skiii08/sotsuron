Blade Runner 2049," A Masterpiece of Cinematography, but quite boring.
","I watched this movie at 9 PM and I've been asleep for 1 minute during a scene. Its not because the movie is bad, but simply there's nothing happened in that 1 minute and I could follow the story quickly after I wake up, also the scenery is calm and beautiful, perfect for a quiet little nap. Its not a movie for you to enjoy the story (even the story is fantastic) but more like to enjoy the cinematography, as a Graphic Designer, I will definitely recommend this movie as a masterpiece reference.As I say, the story is fantastic, but filled really slow. We have some minutes to think about the problem and try to solve it ourselves before the movie brings us the truth. So, its a movie to enjoy, for you to analyze every little detail and they give you a couple of time for that. The actors play nicely (and I adore Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto for such long time), and its not your typical Hollywood movie.",9,6,13,6 October 2017
Sausage Party," Flat
","Im giving 5 stars in comparing this animation to other good animation with good stories. First, the story is just mediocre, like an adult version of low budget toy story. Is not a breakthrough story, more like emoji movie kind of story. Second, I appreciate the idea of matching the story to nowadays issues, like religious and racial issues. I get the messages that they want to tell us about god and creation, human relations and love. Third, There is so many things that cannot make sense like how the foods walking, (while toy story make it more logical, like the toys is 'play dead' when there are human around.) Overall, this animation is not so bad about the meaning, but I can't really enjoy the jokes, really just flat emotions throughout the film.",5,1,2,17 November 2017
Black Panther," Don't understand the hype
","Rotten tomato 97% ? I can't believe this. This movie should have a potential to reach 8.5 at rating, but nah. The concept is terrific, there are so much things that I wanna know about wakanda, their diversity is really interesting, the concept that an african country who hide themselves from world and have the most advanced tech is really blow my mind.
But we have to admit its a quite boring movie. We should know who would win the fight before the fight begin and who's come back to life, thats a problem. Its a really typical superhero movie which marvel not showed to us in thor and civil war (which is great).
The joke had a lot of miss. The character is like just being made 2 minutes ago, even the main villain is not have a clear and builded character. We don't feel anything for the villain even his father is being killed by his uncle and he want to provide high tech for the better world. Suddenly the main vilain is ex american military personel with great skill and this goes nowhere, just mentioned once.When the world start erasing the racism by giving them easiness, then it should be a disgrace to themselves. Just treat everyone the same way.",6,3,4,23 February 2018
Cloud Atlas," Confusing
","The plot is confusing, I cant really see the connection between stories. The worst part is the make up, how they make caucasian actors to be asian, that was done terribly and really affect the plot. I thought they are not an ordinary asian, but some kind of clone or superhuman. They looks like worf from star trek.",6,1,4,2 September 2018
