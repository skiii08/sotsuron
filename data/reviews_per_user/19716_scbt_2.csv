Black Swan," Black Swan: The Beauty of Aronofsky's Reminiscence of Gothic Fiction and Dario Argento's Suspiria
","Tonight I attended the opening night of the Virginia Film Festival and got the chance to see a premiere showing of the highly anticipated film by Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan. The film tells the tale of Nina a professional ballerina, played by Natalie Portman, who is extremely hard working in order to attain the lead role of her ballet company's production of Swan Lake. The director of the production, played by Guy Pierce, is looking to create a new provocative form of the classic ballet by having the same dancer, performing as the Swan Queen, portray both the White Swan and her evil and seductive twin sister, the Black Swan. Nina, who is nothing but perfect for the White Swan, cannot produce the correct form of sensuality and eroticism that her director can accept for the Black Swan. However, with Nina's lacking comes a new comer named Lily, played by Mila Kunis. Lily is a rival character to Nina's goal in that she possesses the sexuality and eroticism that Nina lacks. Throughout the film, tension builds as Nina begins to see unnatural and disturbing visions that make the audience wonder if Lily is out to get her or another jealous character.This film is all about tension and beauty paired with extremely disturbing images of sex and violence, including self mutilation. Furthermore, the film makes it very difficult to tell whether certain visions are real or simply illusions. What impressed me the most, was the film's subtlety in terms of showing blood. Like John Carpenter's masterpiece, Halloween, Aronofsky plays a similar hand in that Black Swan shows very little to no blood at all. However, even without the gore and bloodshed, this film still had the capability to make the entire audience cringe in pain. For example, one particular scene involved Nina pulling at what looked to be a piece of dangling flesh on her middle finger's cuticle. She pulls and tugs at it, all while we hear the tearing and ripping of flesh. Then for a quick second we see her pull a long piece of torn flesh off of her finger. At moments like these, the audience, myself included, reacted by cringing and hissing in pain. While having mostly subtle images of blood, there are some rather grisly scenes in the film as well. I must say that Darren Aronofsky presented the violence beautifully in a way that seemed very reflexive of Dario Argento's Suspiria.Meanwhile, along with the violence and disturbing masochism, we also are given extremely sexual scenes and images. This film is extremely sexual in terms of body language, derogatory slurs, and even scenes of sex and masturbation. These scenes were intense, but revealed Nina as becoming more experienced. In the beginning, Portman portrays Nina as a very sweet and innocent character who develops herself into a much darker individual by the end. The story is of Nina's metamorphosis into the one role she has obsessed over for years. Meanwhile, Lily seems to represent one of the sources of Nina's corruption in how they are both complete opposites, and it seems to be Lily's sexuality and attitude that attract Nina. Furthermore, we are given combinations of disturbing imagery with sex in specific scenes of the film. One scene, for example, involved Nina walking in on Lily having sex with what appears to be the director who is suddenly seen as a demonic visage with black wings. This ultimately provides the audience with a fusion of sex along with dark and disturbing imagery.Overall, I must say, I was extremely impressed with the film. Having seen The Fountain, I have already been a fan of Aronofsky's work, but Black Swan was absolutely the most beautiful, psychological, and disturbing film I have seen since Shutter Island. I feel it is one of the best films of the year, and I couldn't be happier that I got the chance to see it. Natalie Portman was truly exquisite, and this was her best performance ever. I definitely believe that she deserves the Oscar Nomination for Best Actress. She does a beautiful job in presenting a character that the audience can't help but pity and, at times, even fear. Meanwhile, Mila Kunis, whom many know as the voice of Meg on Fox's Family Guy, was also fantastic and also deserves an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Kunis presents Lily as the character the audience can love and hate simultaneously. Furthermore, Winona Ryder also makes a few appearances in the film as a jealous dancer, named Beth, who is forced to retire. She makes a very frightening and stunning return back to the screen in a very impressive way.I must say, this movie is definitely Aronofsky's masterpiece in that it produces the right amount of chills, thrills, and laughs. The camera work is phenomenal, and the art and set designs are gorgeous. Meanwhile, the artistry of the imagery of the film seems to beautifully reflect moments of Gothic literature. One could almost interpret it as a modern retelling of Swan Lake amalgamated with Edgar Allan Poe's 'A Tell-Tale Heart.' The plot is told at a very smooth pace, and by the ending the whole film flows together beautifully. I strongly recommend seeing this film. It's dark, violent, disturbing, sexual, and absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing. It ultimately reveals Aronofsky's artistry at its absolute finest.",10,10,20,4 November 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," An Instant Horror Classic
","We all know the classic tropes of Horror films ever since Scream brought forth its classic rules to survive in this genre. Nowadays, those rules have been reflecting in just about every Horror film being released where there are gratuitous amounts of gore, sex, and drug use. There almost seems to be no hope left in Hollywood either due to their wastes of money with releasing constant remakes and sequels that are just used as money grabbers but have no substance at all. Then, faster than a speeding bullet comes Joss Whedon to rescue the genre for all Horror fans. Whedon has developed a titanic fan base because of his television work with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse, and Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long. He is well known for his combination of horrific violence with slapstick to create perfect self referential stories with much depth and symbolism that calls back to American society. The Cabin in the Woods is the wake up call our generation, and Hollywood, needs. With a perfect cast, sharp and witty writing, clever scares, and a thousand twists, The Cabin in the Woods goes beyond the level of a Horror masterpiece, and is sure to become an instant classic.Now, before going any further, I will express some incredibly important pieces of information to all. First, I have a set list of Horror films that I consider the 'best of the best,' and the top 10 is reserved for strictly the classics, like Psycho, The Exorcist, A Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. After seeing this movie only once, I can say without a doubt that this film has become my second favorite Horror film of all time! Second, this film is a spectacular Horror film; however, I cannot tell anything about it. This is a special type of film, where you have to see it for yourself. It's the type of movie you need to go to the theaters to see with a group of friends and then discuss with only those friends afterwards. I'm sure though with the horrible spoilers on the internet that some may learn some things. However, I cannot express enough how important it is that you do not listen to anyone who has seen the movie. You must see it for yourself!Now that that is out of the way, I will review the film with no spoilers at all. First, the acting was terrific. Joss Whedon has assembled some of the finest actors for this movie, like Chris Hemsworth, and some are even new actors. They all perform very convincingly, and you feel for each of the characters in the film. Next, there is the cinematography which is fantastic. Joss Whedon is not only a master with a pen, but when partnered with Cloverfield's Drew Goddard, he is a master of the camera. The camera work was perfect and crisp for each scene. Furthermore, with a great score this film really knows how to revitalize the classic atmospheres of Horror. Whedon knows exactly what to do to bring the classic Horror film back to life. Meanwhile, there is the writing which is sharp, witty, hilarious, and incredibly sinister. There is a huge mouthful of cynicism in every line given in this film that adds to the overall effect. Also, if you think that you know the story from the trailers, then I have two words for you. THINK AGAIN!!! This film knows what you expect, and then kicks you right in between the legs and sucker punches you over and over and over again. You never know where this film is going to go, as each moment twists and turns until you are basically turned into a giant Rubik's cube (like the house in the poster). Moreover, the film has an extremely high octane entertainment factor because it is the most original Horror film to be released in nearly a decade. To give you a hint, once the end credits started, the theater I was in erupted in cheers and applause. I have never experienced this before.Thus, I come to the end of my review for what has to be the best film of 2012 so far. Joss Whedon deserves a round of applause for this work of Horror GENIUS, and Hollywood now needs to learn what it owes Horror fans. The film is a passionate love letter to Horror fans that I will gladly accept, and if you enjoy originality, cleverness, and pure adrenaline-rushing entertainment in your Horror, then look no further. The Cabin in the Woods is everything Horror fans have been waiting for, and people will be talking about this film for many many years to come.",10,2,15,15 April 2012
