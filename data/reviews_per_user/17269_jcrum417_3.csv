A Star Is Born," Why so much hype?
","I thought the acting was okay, but the characters were not believable to me. What was motivating them? Ally seems to just instantly fall in love with Jackson without any kind of hesitation after we are allowed to know that she is aware he is a drunk. In one scene it looks as if Jackson is near death, and she doesn't even seem to have any kind of reaction to this. Then the next moment she is agreeing to marry him without even seeming to give it any thought. Why? And the ending is just not believable. Why would any rational person just off himself after a single conversation? He could have just walked away. I don't know, but these characters just didn't seem real at all, and Lady Gaga was practically emotionless throughout most of the movie. I mean even when they have a fight, she just doesn't seem to even really be there in the scene. I wanted to slap her so many times, and I just didn't feel anything for her by the end. Jackson was more believable except for the ending. The film itself had such a strong 1970s vibe, and I don't care for that. The editing was distracting, and the camera work I didn't care for so much. I liked a few of the songs, but most of them I didn't care for. I appreciate that they did the songs live like that, but they didn't feel real. The song Shallow just didn't come off as realistic at all to me. Neither did this idea that she came up with complex song lyrics on the fly when they were first getting to know each other. Overall, I got through the movie, but I really didn't care for it. It didn't move me at all or entertain me. I really don't understand the hype other than it appears that they want to profit from the legions of Lady Gaga fans. I am disappointed that other films and performances are being ignored because of this film.",4,1,4,2 February 2019
