10 Cloverfield Lane," A good movie that has no need of carrying the name 'Cloverfield', because it stands fine on its one
","In '10 Cloverfield Lane' we meet Michelle. She get's involved into a car accident, but when she wakes up, she is not in her car or in an hospital, she now is in a bunker. Here there are two guys, one of whom is the owner of the bunker, who claimes that the air outside is not breathable anymore. Now she has to find out if it is true, or that the man is just insane...This is the directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg. And hats of to him. He was a really good director. You may think that the movie would become boring after a while, due to the movie being set underground for a very big part, but Dan Trachtenberg made sure it didn't. He used different shots to keep you interested and he also took different directions each time. When there was dialogue you could be sure that you would see an alternation of different shots. This was done good, and kept you from getting bored. He is also a very good visual director. Lot's of the shots looked very nice. Especially the outside shots, here he had more room to work with and he used it, to accentuate that she now was outside and not in a small space anymore. That's why there were also a lot of close-ups in the scenes inside the bunker, to show the claustrophobia. This I found clever. The cinematography was done very good too which only complimented the directing. The cinematographer of '10 Cloverfield Lane' was Jeff Cuttr. The soundtrack was also very well chosen. The soundtrack made the intense scenes only more intense and the faster editing also helped with this. The songs where people in sang were also very good. The make-up design was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly, because I thought that this was going to be a low budget film. The wounds looked realistic and were not nice to look at.The acting was very good. The cast was small, but filled with good actors. There was one person that surprised me a lot and this was also the main actress of the movie. This is of course Mary Elizabet Winstead, who played Michelle. I only have seen Winstead play bad characters or in movies where she just acted bad, but in this movie it is not the case. This was by far her best performance yet. She did well in the emotional scenes and also in the scenes just based on her facial expressions. She might have been good, but her co-worker overshadowed her. This was John Goodman. He was really good. Grom him I've seen a couple of movies and he was good in all of them, it just seems he is getting better by the years. He was threatening and intimidating. His unpredictable character only made it better. The last person on the list is Emmett. He was the other guy in the bunker. Emmet was played by John Gallagher Jr. He wasn't as special as the previous two, but he nonetheless gave a good performance.The writing was the problem with this movie. Everything of the script was fine but the ending. The ending was way to abrupt and the tone switch wasn't handled well. The whole movie had an isolated, thrilling feel, but when she got out the tones rapidly changed. The ending was also dumb and kind of predictable. This was my main problem with the movie. The dumb ending. That's why my grade changed from a 9.5 to an 8.5. The dialogue was very well and carefully written, the dialogue fitted with the characters who said them. Which brings me to the next subject, the characters. These where well developed. Each one of them, which is very rare in today's movies. John Goodmans character I found the best. His character was the most interesting and intriguing. He was unpredictable, like I've said, but this was only one more thing to make his character interesting. The character of Mary Elizabeth Winstead was smart also something that you don't see a lot in movies these days, and also very likable. Emmett did undergo a character arc at the end, which was very good and well handled. I think by now you can see my surprise for the bad ending. Everything from the script was done so well and with care and at the end they just gave up or something. A smaller problem that I have with the screenplay is that you are still left with some questions, but I think that they did this intentionally, so you can think about the movie even after you've seen it. This is an acceptable excuse, but for some questions I think they didn't give you enough hints, or evidence. I also have no clue why the movie carries 'Cloverfield' in the title, because it has nothing to do with that movie at all.In the end I would say that '10 Cloverfield Lane' was a good movie, one of the better movies I've seen that came out in 2016. Just the ending ruined it for me and that's why I'm giving this movie a 8.5/10",9,1,2,5 August 2016
The Finest Hours," Interesting story, OK execution
","A ship gets stuck in a storm. Now a team has to be sent to the ship, to rescue as many people as possible.The movie was directed by Craig Gillespie, a director who has not made a lot of movies. Yet. He has previously made movies in cooperation with Disney. This time he did it again for 'The Finest Hours'. Gillespie did a very good job at directing. He used a lot of cool camera movements, that a lot of the time worked. Sometimes when he used them on see and the shot transfers to a green screen one, but he tries to hide it and make it look like it was one take, were sometimes nauseating. But he also has used some good one-take scenes, like the first time where they are saying how fast and at which degree they have to sail. I was fairly impressed by that scene. The second time it had less power, because we had seen it before. He did however knew how to create tension. There were some really tenseful scenes, but sometimes he just dragged them out that tiny bit to far. Some decisions he made were pretty daubtable. Like constantly editing away from the tanker, even when the rescue crew was already away. The cool, good and interesting things are happening over there. Not on land. So I don't get why he decided to constantly edit between those places. He also didn't pay a lot of attention to the details. The cold, for example. There was no way you could see that they were cold. There were no little clouds coming out of their mouth, there was no shivering... It's the details that make the movie. The set design was also pretty impressive. So were the clothes. They felt like it came from the 50'. The cgi and green screen were fine. When I read that they worked on the special effects for a year, I was expecting top notch effects, but instead I got the opposite. The green screen was very noticeable and off-putting. The characters looked too accentuated, because the edges of them looked a tiny bit blurred. The way how the boat moved in the sea looked very convincing to me, though. The editing was a bit to slow for me in the first act, but in the second and third they edit sometimes a bit to much to show the reaction of every actor, which was not necessary. The acting was good. There were two main characters in the movie: one played by Chris Pine, one played by Casey Affleck. Let's start with Chris Pine. Overall he was fine. His accent was consistent and in the emotional scenes he preformed very well, but when he was talking for a long time, he reminded me of Mark Wahlberg in 'The Happening', which is not a compliment. But the other moments weigh up to this, so on average I would say he was fine. Casey Affleck was really good in the movie. He gave one of his better performances in the last couple of years. It was much better than his performance in the movie that also came out in 2016 called 'Tripple 9' Not a good movie. He had some moments where I could see he was acting, so that's my only really criticism about him. Holliday Grainger was very good. She played Miriam.The writing was the biggest problem of the movie. The story was good, because otherwise I wouldn't have decide to watch the thing. Just the first act was done badly. The love story between Pine and Grainger was not that relevant to the story in my opinion it didn't emote me in the end, so the point of all this is not clear to me. What also made the first act not bearable was the chemistry between Pine and Grainger. They didn't fit together at all. The character of Miriam was interesting, though, but just wrongly integrated into the movie, whereby they made her boring. That's also why I said in the beginning of my review, that the land-stuff was not interesting. Pines character was also so stupid in the beginning of the movie. with this I don't mean that his character was a dull/silly character. No he was genially stupid. I think they might've tried to make him seem to be in love, or awkward, but they just failed in that aspect. The character of Casey Affleck was good. He was a likable character, so you were rooting for him. You wanted him to get of the boat. The story is also very predictable, but I already knew what I was getting myself into before even watching the movie. And it's a Disney movie. That says enough.In the end this movie was an OK attempt at recreating a true story. There were some problems, but nothing that bad, that the movie is unwearable. That's why this movie get's a 6.0/10 from me.",6,1,1,9 October 2016
Fury," not what I expected
","Fury is about a group of guys in a tank. But at a certain point they get someone new in This is Norman (Logan Lerman). He has trouble killing people, and being in war. His sergeant has to 'help' him with this. But this is just a side story-line, and I just found that out when he starts killing people in the movie, which I didn't like. The main story is about the sergeant who has to guide a group of tanks through Germany. The movie is directed by David Ayer. I really liked the directing of the movie, they also went with this gray- isch tone. I really like that sort of style. Sometimes it is used right in movies, and sometimes it isn't. An example where it is used right: Gone girl, and THIS MOVIE. The action sequences are very well filmed, only in the beginning of the movie it was a bit fast edited. he acting in the movie was good. I really liked the chemistry between Don and Norman. Logan Lerman did one of his best performances yet. Really liked his character, also Brad Pitt did a good job, but less spectacular. This couple got the best lines and where involved in one of my favorite scenes of the movie (I have two favorite scenes the next one is a bit further in this text) the scene is when Don forces Norman to kill a German soldier, that was a very well written and acted scene by both of the actors. I didn't like Shia that much. I loved Jon Bernthal, you hate him at first, but you grow out loving him, he is also in my other favorite scene is when Emma died and Grady tells Norman that that is war. I also got attached to the characters, so I felt bad, when a lot of them died near the end of the movie. the writing was also pretty good, it wasn't anything amazing, but it was good. This was also done by David Ayer. They manged to replicate a realistic world war. and something I cant forget to mention: this movie is very gruesome, don't trust the parents guide with this one. There is very realistic and gory violence. I trusted the parents guide and I was kind of shocked when I saw the movie, luckily I can handle these parts quite a bit,but if you can't handle gory violence than don't watch the movie.And like I have said in the title of my review, the movie is not what I expected, I expected it to be worse because I have read a lot of negative reviews about this movie. Here are some individual scores, like I usually do:Directing: 8.5/10writing: 8/10Acting: 9/10Tension: 8/10Drama: 9/10 that is a total of 42.5/50 which is rounded an 8 or a 9 out of ten. I am going to round it down to an 8/10",8,9,16,29 June 2015
The Maze Runner," Wasn't so aMAZEing
","Maze Runner is about Thomas (Dylan O'Brien). In the beginning of the movie we see Thomas waking up while getting lift up by an elevator. When the elevator stops he sees that he is surrounded by a group of young guys. They are all standing in a circle of a forest like landscape, but this place is surrounded by a maze. To escape from the maze they send out these 'runners'. By day the runners go in to the maze and try to memorize the maze so they can find a way out. the guys don't send runners out by night because the maze closes then and there are these grievers. of course Thomas wants to be a runner and so the story starts. I have some questions about this movie that made the movie just stupid, so let me get them out of the way. First question( and probably the most asked one): Why didn' they climb on the vines? I know that Newt(Thomas Brodie-Sangster) said that the vines didn't reached to the top, but you could clearly see that they did. Or they could have at least build a ladder or something. My second question is maybe a bit dull but still, How do they get their hair gell? I even read on the trivia that Dylan O'Brien almost didn't get the roll just for his hairstyle, because there was to much gell in it. So why bother Dylan but let the rest of the guys keep their gell? My third question: How could they have mapped the maze if it changes every night? And now my biggest complaint: The ending!. It was just to much set up for the next movie and it didn't make sense, they also let someone die. The makers hope that you care about the person that dies but you really don't. I also have some move problems with this movie, but they are just small problems so I don't bother telling you.Now the directing. The directing of the movie was overall not to bad. Only the scene where Thomas gets attacked by one of the grievers for the first time you couldn't really see what was going on. This was due to the dark and by the shaky cam. This wasn't very tense, to not say it wasn't at all, because you just knew that Thomas would survive a night in the maze. But the fight scene between Thomas and Gally (Will Poulter) was well directed and tense. but this was one of the only tense moments of the movie. The special effects were good at times (the maze) but also bad (the grievers) and sometimes you could just see that they were standing in front of a green screen. the script of this movie wasn't that good it was just a bit dull, there were some good parts. This is why you just didn't care about the characters and why I didn't feel sad when someone was killed of. Due to the bad writing the jokes didn't also really work. But the overall plot was OK, just the ending. The acting was surprisingly good. Dylan O'Brien was likable as Thomas. And Will Poulter surprised me as Gally. Gally was this leader of the group guys before Thomas came. And Thomas didn't really follow the rules of Gally, which gave some chemistry between the characters. There was also this character Chuck, played by Blake Cooper. I didn't like his character at all. He was supposed to be the comic relieve. But he wasn't funny and I was annoyed by it. Blake Coopers acting wasn't so convincing. But overall the acting was good and I think that that was the best part of the movie.This movie isn't a total disaster and you won't get mad about it, just about the ending. I get why some people liked it and some people don't so go watch it and decide by yourself.",5,0,0,31 August 2015
Memento," Very creative
","Memento is a movie about Leonard (Guy Pearce). He suffers from some kind of short-term memory, but not really, because he can remember everything till the day that his wive gets murdered and raped. He himself gets a head injury, due this he gets his short- terms memory. He remembers everything by taking pictures and by putting down a little description. Leonard also puts down tattoos on his body with very important text on. These texts are clues that he found out about the murder of his wife. with these techniques he tries to track down the murderer of his wife and kill him.The directing of the movie is, as always with Nolan, amazing. I don't have anything more to say about it, only that the fighting scene in the bathroom is a bit to closed up.Not the scene with the flashback of the murder. But for the rest (not sure if you say it like that in English, not native) the directing was good.the acting was also very well. Really liked Guy Pearce in this movie, I personally think that this is one of his best role. Carrie- Anne Moss played one of my favorite characters. I really liked the way she played with Leonards short-term memory. This really made me hate her, but it was just so well acted. Joe Pantoliano as Teddy was a fun character, and he stays mysterious throughout a big part of the movie. Some things that I liked about the movie were that you really had to pay attention during the movie. I also liked that the movie was very well created. With this I mean that you get some scenes then you get some gray and white scenes and then there are scenes that are about what happened before the first scenes and so on and so on. But the ending is just mind blowing and was my favorite part of the movie. This is because it is so well written and clever. I totally didn't see it coming and was very surprised, I literally sat there with an open mouth.I am sorry if my English wasn't good and that this review is pretty short, but here are some individual scores.Directing: 9.5/10Acting: 9.5/10Writing: 10/10Ending: 10/0This is a total of 39/40 which is rounded a 10/10. I really recommend seeing this movie.",10,0,2,2 August 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 'Rogue One' is lacking in characters but succeeds in a lot of the rest!
","'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is about a group of Rebels, who are trying to steal the plans of the Death Star.Gareth Edwards was an excellent choice for directing. He really nailed to make a 'war' movie, which is dark and gritty, yet manages to stay pg-13 and has no desire to be rated R. He is a director who has a knowledge of scale and he shows it. During the battle sequences we see everything from the ground up: from the perspective of the protagonists. Due to this you feel more involved with the characters and the enemy also looks more imposing and scary. Edwards also used shadow in a nice why, by which he created some good looking shots. He didn't only use it to create a nice shot, but he also used it in a creative manner, by only filming the shadow. An example is the first time we see Darth Vader. He films the wall next to Krennic, so the shadow of Darth looks very big next to the small Krennic. Again, to show that Darth Vader is very dangerous and stands above all. It gives cool shots with a meaning to them. That whole scene was amazing, actually. The action scenes he handled well too. Sometimes I found these to be quickly edited, but these were mostly in the beginning of the movie. He also exchanged hand-held camera with some form of steady cam, which really worked well when Chirrut defeated the group of Stormtroopers. That and the choreography made the scene good. The last act was absolutely fantastic: I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. During that act they also used some left over scenes from the original trilogy of pilots in X-wings. It was notable, but I found it to be a cool extra.The soundtrack was not made by John Williams, which is pretty surprising, because he had composed the score of I believe, all the other Star Wars movies. The new composer, Michael Giacchino, did a very good job. He re-used some of Williams's work, but changed them a bit. He managed to create an original score, which had a Star Wars-feel to it, which I very much liked. The special effects were some of the best that I have seen this year. This really helped with the action scenes and also with the use of the laser shot from Death Star. They were able to portray the destruction very well. Gran Moff Tarkin looked very good. First I didn't even notice that he was CG, but at some points you were able to see that he kind of looked like a video-game character.The acting too was good. Felicity Jones played a strong female protagonist, where she showed her emotions really well. She sometimes acted a bit flat, but most of the times I liked her very much. But that flat acting was maybe to show the wall that Jyn has built up, so people can't see how she feels, and I believe that this was their goal. Diego Luna I really liked. He performed well in all of the scenes. He did have good charisma. Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang were both very good. They had good chemistry and it felt like they went back a long time. The antagonist, played by Ben Mendelsohn, was very good. He was menacing and fitted his role very well. The last thing I want to mention here is the character of Darth Vader. A lot of people said that he was underutilized, but I didn't think that that was true. He had good scenes and lines and also one of my favorite scenes of the movie. The scene where he plows through rebels like it's nothing. That scene was really awesome to look at. The writing was good. The story was one that should've been told and it was strong on that aspect. I didn't find the story boring or lacking. What I did find a bit dull was that the character of Jyn was the only one who really was developed. From Diego Luna's character we only get one scene, in which we learn something about him, and that scene worked for me. In the beginning we also see that he is a rebel, but someone who doesn't go by as a 'good-guy', because he shoots someone in the back. Now my problem doesn't lie with these two characters, but with the rest of them. They were not given anything, except for some emotionless exposition. The pilot, played by Riz Ahmed, got brainwashed, but just after a few scenes he was OK, even though Gerrera said that he would go insane. It didn't make any sense and would've been some character development. Due to the lack of rounded characters the ending didn't really emote me, whereby the death of them all was kind of useless. The acting was the thing that kind of saved this, because due to the acting I felt like they did have a character build around them. The dialogue had some good lines and was funny at times. Most of these comedic moments were given to K-2SO, which was by the way a fun character, just introduced by a lot of exposition. And that's all we get to know from him. Alan Tudyk did a good job at voice acting. The ending was very good and tied in with 'A New Hope' well. Again they used CGI in that scene for the face of Leia, but I also think that that looked good. In the end 'Rogue One' was a very good Star Wars movie, whose story is one that had to be told. The ending was a nice conclusion. The characters were lacking, but the directing I found to be very good. The CGI, just like all of the shots, were good-looking and the acting was great. That's why 'Rogue One' gets a 8.6/10.",9,2,8,25 December 2016
Public Enemies," An emotionless film, with good action scenes and acting!
","'Public Enemies' is a biopic about the robbing-life of John Dillinger told from his perspective and from that of the police.Michael Mann, the director of among others 'Last of the Mohicans', was also the director of this movie. In the previous named film he did a good job, in this one however, I found that it didn't live up to my expectations. He made some bold choices, whereby the movie suffered. He sometimes made it look like they were filming a documentary, which may sound logical, because it's based on a true story, but it really wasn't integrated nicely into the film and didn't fit well with what the movie had set up as a theme. He also let the camera shake a lot, which also didn't always work. Sometimes it did, like in the beginning sequence, which I by the way very much enjoyed. In that beginning sequence he used good soundtrack and changed the camera viewpoint often, whereby he has created an interesting and tense scene. Unfortunately the rest of the film wasn't as good as that first scene. Mann also used close- ups very often in this film, which gave a claustrophobic feel to the movie. That didn't fit with the movie as well. But he interchanged them at times with long shots, and due to this you weren't always caught in a claustrophobic feel. He also overused shadow and that sometimes created a nice shot, but other times it didn't work out that well. But overall this wasn't really annoying and it worked most of the times. It helped to create a dark atmosphere, and I believe that that was what Mann was trying to reach. The cinematography wasn't the greatest too: it was not a good looking movie. Which is by the way surprising, because the cinematographer had previously worked with Mann in other movies, that did look good. Michael Mann did however capture the action scenes very good. Those were tense and exciting to watch. Those scenes were actually the one that saved the movie, unfortunately. The soundtrack, though, I found to be pretty good, just like the costume design. This really helped to create the atmosphere the movie was going for. The sets too looked realistic and helped with the previous named thing. The sound design was good as well. The gunshots and all sounded realistic to me. The editing of movies is always done in a special way with Michael Mann, and in this film that was again the case. Sometimes I was a fan of it sometimes I wasn't, because at times scenes were edited in a clever way, like with placing the head of the character in one corner and switching between two characters at different places having a telephone conversation, but their head is always at the same paces, if that was any clear. So it was a hit or miss with the editing. But I found the pacing to be good. Hence this is a two hour plus film, I was expecting dull, boring parts, but there were none, due to the good pacing.The acting was very good. I had my doubts with Johnny Depp, because there are only two ways he performs: absolutely fantastic, or absolutely horrible. An example of an absolutely horrible performance of him can be found in the terrible, atrocious film called 'Mortdecai'. What a bad film. But in this movie I had a bit of hope it would lean to the fantastic side – 'Edward Scissorhands' for example - , because Michael Mann was behind the camera, and it did in fact lean to the fantastic side. I very much liked his performance. Christian Bale, who played the detective trying to capture John Dillinger, too had a good acting achievement. His accent was consistent and sounded good to me. Marion Cotillard played the new girlfriend of John Dillinger. She gave a very good performance. I thought that she was the best out of the cast.The writing was lesser good. The story was interesting and told in a good way, but it was emotionless. The characters didn't get any development, whereby you didn't care what happened to them or what would happen to them: it just felt flat. The only really emotion we see from John Dillinger is when he says what happened in his youth in a quick fashion to Marion Cotillard. And that's about it, which is kind of sad actually, because we see Jason Clarke's character in a lot of scenes with Johnny's, but yet I can't even recall his name. So when he died it just felt like another disposable cast-member died, even though this wasn't what they were going for. The dialogue, however, was well written and realistic. Some of the lines were very good, but I think that they focused a bit too much on that aspect of the script, and less on the charactorial part of it. In the end this wasn't Michael Mann's best films, but it wasn't his worst either. The acting was good and so was the beginning sequence. The script was lacking in character development, but it succeeded at the dialogues. Nonetheless, even though the characters weren't good, Michael Mann managed to create good action sequences that held up the movie together with the acting. That's why this film gets a 6.2/10 from me.",6,3,4,31 December 2016
127 Hours," One of the best movies based on a true story.
","Some spoilers might have slipped through, so brace yourself warned!'127 Hours' is based on the true story of Aron Ralston. Aron is an engineer, who's passion lays more in adventure. So one day he decides that he wants to go, and have some fun in Moab, Utah. But he does this without telling anyone about it, so when his arm get's stuck between a rock and a wall, panic starts to flow..This movie was directed by Danny Boyle. This is also the person who wrote the screenplay for the movie, I love when directors also write the screenplay, this shows their dedication to the movie (in most cases), but more on the screenplay later. He has one multiple movies, and this is the first one that I've seen of him, so I can't really compare with his previous films. In this movie he utilizes a very cool and refreshing style. The three way screen (I think you'll understand what I mean if you've seen the movie), was at first a bit weird, and I didn't quite like it. But as the movie progressed, I started to enjoy and appreciate it more. This can be seen throughout the movie, but the longer parts are in the beginning, and at the end of the movie. I also liked that he used the footage of the camera of Aron. He was also creative at times; by making it look like there was a camera in the tube of his drinking bag. This gave a cool effect. The cinematography was also done very well. This was gorgeous to look at. This was done by two people Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle. The make-up was really good. Which leads me to one of my favorite scenes of the movie. The scene where he cuts of his own arm. I very much enjoyed this part because of the brilliant way it was directed and acted. You could really see the pain, anger and fear in James Fronco's eyes. The wounds looked real, a bit to real as well. But due to the rapid editing you get spared a bit. In most cases I would hate a fast edited part, but here I felt blessed for it :). The cgi was a bit of a downside for me. The bird that flies over looked very cg, just like the upcoming clouds. But the water-bag cgi looked good to me, if it even was cgi.The acting was good, and this is an average, because James Franco was amazing, and the rest, not so much. Not that they were bad, but there weren't great either. So let's start of with the main character. Aron, played by James Franco. In this review I've already said multiple times that he was fantastic, because he was. He showed his acting qualities numerous times during the movie, mostly during the emotional parts. It's just so fascinating that he can convince me so good that he is in pain. Sadly he hasn't really picked good movies recently. There aren't a lot of actors in '127 Hours', so I'll just discus Kate Mara, and Amber Tamblyn. First, Kate Mara. She is overall a good actress, just one of her latest movies is not a good one *cough* Fant4Stick *cough*. But she has redeemed herself in 'The Martian'. In this movie she plays Kristi, a girl who is walking in the same place with her friend as Aron. Aron meets them, and befriends them. She was fine. Not her greatest role, but also not her worst. Her friend was played by Amber Tamblyn, and she was fine too. On the rest of the supporting cast I can't judge, because I've seen so little of them.The screenplay is, like I've said, written by the director, Danny Boyle, but also by Simon Beaufoy. The screenplay was very well written. Even though there wasn't a lot of dialogue, they kept me interested and invested with the film. This of course isn't only because of the script, but because of the directing as well. The dialogue, as far as there was some, was good. A thing that some people might find stupid, is that you can see that they are struggling to reach the ninety minute mark. They use lot's of flashbacks, and thoughts, that stretch out the duration of the movie. In some circumstances I didn't mind them. For example the thought of Aron that it started to rain. This just showed how desperate he was to survive, but also heartbroken, near the end. Just that scene alone describes his feelings during the movie. The characters weren't that great developed. Aron kind of was, but it just didn't make me care more about him. The supporting cast wasn't worth to developed, so I didn't care about that they didn't do it. What they do manage to do is to create a starting feeling with Aron. Due to the charisma of James Franco.That was my review for an emotional movie, with very good directing, and a fantastic main actor. 8.7/10",9,0,1,30 April 2016
Alexander," Bad writing, bad acting, bad directing... the perfect cocktail...
","This may contain spoilersFirst of all, the movie starts really bad. Acutually, the beginning of the movie is so boring. just an old man walking around and talking, nothing else, just an old man saying bad lines. and when the man stops talking and we see Alexander for the first time as a kid, O God... that was one of the worst parts. Angelina her accent was so bad, so, so bad. I wonder why these actors agreed after they have read the script. I am not going to review the hole movie. If I would do that it would take me ages to tell how bad it was.Do yourself a favor and don't go and watch it, I had to because they made me watch it in class. If still are planning on watching it, go watching it just for fun. it is just so sad it makes it hilarious.",1,5,6,14 May 2015
The Town," A very well developed drama
","The movie is about a crew who robs banks and armored trucks. But one day they rob a bank and they take a hostage. They set her free, but someone has to follow her. The one that has to follow her is Doug (Ben Afflec) He then falls in love with Claire (Rebecca Keesey) Doug tries to retire but decides to take two more jobs... The movie is also portrayed by the view of two cops, how they try to track down the crew of Doug. these cops are Adam Frawley (John Hamm) He is like the bad and driven cop. And the other cop is Dino Ciampa (Titus Welliver) he is a more gentle cop.The directing of the movie is done very well. A thing that I didn't like was the shaky cam. When there where action/ fight scenes there was often some shaky cam. this style of filming made it hard to see what was going on. But the heist scenes were filmed very well which weighs against my previous disadvantage. These scenes were also quite thrilling. The car chasing scenes are pretty good. The acting in 'The town' was very well done. I really liked Jeremy Renner character (James Coughlin). THis is one of Jermeys best roles (in my opinion). Also Blake Lively did a good job. She was very convincing. Ben acted less good, but his character was very well developed. They start working on his character when Doug and Claire are talking to each other, and Doug starts talking about how his mother left him. This was a very well written scene and also one of my favorites. the dialogue is overall also very well. Another scene that I liked is when Doug goes to Coughlin and says: 'I need your help. I can't tell you what it is, you can never ask me about it later, and we're gonna hurt some people.' then Coughlin says: 'Whose car are we gonna take?' This is really funny in the movie, and this isn't the only funny scene. The moments that were meant funny genuinely turned out to be funny. The movie doesn't have a lot of these moments, but that is just because this is a drama and not a comedy...A thing thing that I liked is that they also filmed from the view of the police, this gave a interesting take on the movie. The love story of Doug and Claire is also good, it didn't fell to forced. But now something I didn't really like was that you don't get to know the rest of the crew that much. So when they die at the end, you don't really feel sad, or care about them. The only person I cared about when he died is Coughlin. this is because they focus more on him. When Gloansy died it was funny and sad, it was funny because of the things he said, and sad because he gave his own live to save Doug and Coughlin. Now that I have said what I wanted to say, I'll give you some individual scores:Directing: 8/10Writing: 9/10Acting: 9/10Thrilling: 8.5/10That is a total of 34.5/40.On ten that would be a 8.6/10. Which is rounded: 9/10",9,0,1,19 July 2015
Suicide Squad," Did I have fun? kind of. Was It good? not really
","'Suicide Squad' exist from bad guys. The group they'll send in when they can't afford losing anyone. To control them, they have a bomb in their neck and a gift to look forward to. If they succeed, they'll lose 10 years of their sentence. If they don't, they die. Now the squad has a mission. 'Suicide Squad' is directed by the wonderful director David Ayer. I call him wonderful because of his previous films ('End of Watch' and 'Fury), but this time I wouldn't call him wonderful. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy and a lot of his movies, but this time he just fell short. His directing wasn't in his style and felt forced for me. But he also made some bold choices that were probably demanded by the studios, throughout the review you'll know what I mean. The visual directing was fine, it was a bit to dark for me. It wasn't always clear what was going on. The cinematography also was a bit on the same level of the directing not great not horrible. This was done by Roman Vasyanov, who has worked with Ayer before in his best movies (The previous named ones). But let's change things up with something really good. The soundtrack. Man this was maybe the best part of the movie. I didn't expect to hear 'Seven Nation Army', but now that I've heard it in the movie I realize that it kind of fits. Same goes with 'Bohamian Rhapsody' of Queen, which we had heard before in the trailer. This song was very well chose; it was chaotic, which complimented the movie very well. But these weren't the only good songs, of course. The styles of music changed a lot, but this was only to accentuate the chaotic feel of the movie. If Ayer had any involvement in this, than he did a really good job. Now let's move on to something bad again. The editing. This wasn't always bad, but a lot of the time it was. The movie suffers from pacing issues and sometimes it feels like there was just edited a part out. For example: when Harley breaks the window and takes something, wherafter she walks away. After she has the little dialogue with Flag it seems that the scene ends, but it doesn't. There is just a brief shot of something else, but then moves on to Will Smith walking to the same thing to look at a jacket. This was obviously a re-shoot. That's also the reason why there was this editing mistake. I can't comprehend why you could let such a mistake slide in such a big budget movie. And this isn't the only editing mistake, but I'll quite there. I still have a minor issue to say and this involves the sound. This is just a detail, that I think could've easily been fixed. When The Joker and Harley are in the helicopter and are talking there is no sound whats-however of the helicopter, but in some scenes they thought of adding the helicopter sound. So why not here?The acting was very well done. I think that the actors were all well cast and fitted them well. I'll just talk about a few of them, due to the word limit. The first one I want to talk about is Will Smith. I was very skeptical when he got cast, because he is nothing like the character Deadshot, but he nailed it. He was good in the emotional scenes (where a lot of them were re-shoots I believe) and also in the other. Margot Robbie is next on my list. Her portrayal of Harley was really good. It was like she was ripped straight from the comic- book. The only thing that I have to say about her is that her accent sometimes went away, but that's just a minor detail. Jai Courntey is also someone I quickly want to mention. I can't believe I'm saying this, but he actually was good. This is the first movie I've seen of him where he is good. If you want to hear something about Jared Leto as The Joker... I can't really say yet. I haven't seen a lot of him, but judging on the things seen, I can say he over-acted a bit, but was fine overall. A thing that I disliked about his character was that he was completely useless in the movie. The writing is one of the bigger problems of the movie. The dialogue wasn't neccesairliy bad, but the story overall was. It was your cliché superhero movie, which ends with a generic bad guy and a laser beam pointing up in the sky. It's nothing new and it is told a billion times before. Almost all of the times it ended up with being bad, so why would it work now. The one-liners did work. They were funny and witty, but sometimes there were some cringe-worthy ones. The one- liners were mostly given to Deadshot and Harley: the stars of the movie. The characters were well developed, but how they were developed was not the greatest. They really push it in your face every time it happens they're like: 'Look sad things have happened to them. Now care about them.' But the only person that they kill of, where they want you to care about, wasn't well developed. So was the villain. There was no motivation for her to do these things, they don't even explain it. But how they introduced the characters was done in a fun way, but the editing was a bit sloppy there. And I don't know why they didn't introduce everyone of them. That didn't make any sense.In the end I have to say that this isn't Ayers best film. It has a lot of problems, but the acting and soundtrack do carry the movie for a big part. Thats why I'm giving this movie a 6.4/10",6,1,2,7 August 2016
Taxi Driver," 'You talking to me?'
","In this Martin Scorsesse film, we get to know Travis Bickle. Travis is an unstable Vietnam war veteran, who now works as a taxi driver. During one of his night routines, he meets a young girl, who is by his believe a girl forced into prostitution, and now he wants to save her and make the world a better place.Like I have said this movie is directed by Martin Scorsesse. Scorsesse is an amazing director. I haven't seen a lot of him, yet, but I really want to see them all. He uses a lot of steady cam. My favorite style. To my knowledge there was no shaky cam. This can be obnoxious at times, so luckily this wasn't there. The cinematography is very pretty. This was done by Micheal Chapman. He has worked with Scorsesse for a couple of other times. The clothing and clothes overall were great. There are iconic items in there (the clothes of De Niro) The make-up was fine, just the fake blood. It really looked fake. the colors just didn't fit. But I have read a reason for this, so I understand why they did this. The pacing of this movie is fantastic. It starts of kind of slow, but then near the end it speeds up. And due to this you gets this tense feel, which is very good. The music is very interesting chosen, in the beginning, I was a bit skeptical about it, it looked to me that it didn't fit, but at the end of the movie I thought that it was a very well chosen soundtrack, which fitted the theme.The acting is flawless. I absolutely adored the acting of De Niro. Robert De Niro played Travis, the taxi driver. He was a very interesting character, because he is so unpredictable. I liked that they first showed us his daily routine, how he talks to his friends and so on. But then how he gets paranoid, and crazy. You can notice it actually pretty early on in the movie, and this may sound stupid to a lot of you, when he looks at the glass of soda in the cafeteria. And the camera focuses on it from above. For me this showed who Travis is, by just a glass of soda. And that is one of the reason why I loved this movie, how they could just show a entire character in one shot. This was/is one of Robert De Niros best movies ever in my opinion (havn't seen Raging Bull) The next person I am going to discus is Jodie Foster. This is one of her first roles, if not her first. She was fantastic too. She played the prostitute, called Iris. De Niros character wants to save her, so she can have a better live, a normal live. Her character was less interesting as Travis, but I still liked her though. Jodie Foster was convincing, and had a very good portraying. Now the group of taxi drivers. They were all very realistic. They felt real, and looked like real taxi drivers. The last person I am going to talk about played the character called Betsy. Cybill Shepherd played her. In this movie, she has a sort of relationship with Travis. What I really liked was the chemistry between them. And how she helped him to get driven of the edge, so he will snap. Well, she did it without the knowledge about it, but still.The script was written by Paul Schrader. It is a very good script. Here are also Iconic elements, like the 'You talking to me?' scene, but this isn't my favorite scene, although they portray really good how crazy he has already become. My favorite scene is when Travis picks up a pedestrian, who is ultimately going to kill his wive. I really liked this scene, because it sort of showed us how Travis will be. It was a tensful scene, with very good dialogue, that is why this scene stood out to me. I didn't even realize that it was Scorsesse himself playing that man, and now I am surprised to know that. It was very well acted on his side, and of course on De Niros side as well. The narration in the beginning of the movie is good. By using this, we get to know Travis better. And we can also see inside of his head, which also helps with portraying the craziness. If you combine all of the good elements I have just said, you will get a dark, realistic portraying of a man who is losing his mind. But with great cinematography, acting and writing. I absolutely loved this movie. It is one of those movies, that only get better, the more you think about them. I would definitely recommend watching this classic!",10,2,3,24 January 2016
Shutter Island," A scary and compelling movie...
","95In this movie we are in the year 1954 a couple of years after the world war. 'Shutter Island' begins with the main protagonist standing on a boat on his way to an island 'Shutter island' on this island there is a hospital for mental ill people. He gets send there, not because he is mental ill, but because there is an escaped patient. The protagonist is called Teddy Daniels and is a US Marshal, who is put on an seem like impossible task...The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese. A man with a lot of movies on his name. He had previously made some movies with Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, The Aviator...). He did a good job at directing this movie, and you could see that they have worked together in the way of DiCaprio's acting (a bit over him in the second alinea). The cinematography was nice too. It had some pretty shots in it (the last shot of the lighthouse). The cinematographer was Robert Richardson. The green screen wasn't the greatest. You could easily spot when they were using one. The colors used were quite nice to look at. When it was day time it all looked very colorful, but when it was night time it were sad and somber colors. The blood, when someone was killed, was very red, and I think they did this, to accentuate it, and that you would see it well. So it looked more dramatic. In the flashbacks or dream sequences they used another sort of color, the were brighter (in his dreams) and darker (in his flashbacks. Which brings me how interesting the flashbacks and dreams were, just as the hallucinations of his. The dreams were very well edited, and handled. The flashbacks were nicely shot and showed well how a damaged person Teddy was. The hallucinations were a mix of the flashbacks and dreams, with the characters who appeared in them meting. That is also a thing that I 'liked'. The contrast between his wife and the little girl. The girl died of freezing to death, and his wife burned to death. But what I think they handled the best was the portraying of the mental hospital. It looked scary, due to the good music and the honking boat noise. But also due to the acting of the patients and the make-up brought on thel (the slid neck make up of a woman working in the garden, or the scar across the face of Laeddis. But the editing throughout the movie was just OK, a lot of the times positions of the hands changed, and I wasn't even looking for this kind of mistakes. The acting was just brilliant by everyone. Especially by Leonardo Dicaprio, he played the protagonist of this story, Teddy. He really showed at times how scared he was of reality (ending) and also how scarred he was during the entire movie. In the flashbacks you really got to know him. He had a very powerful scene in one of them, in which he puts away the gun of a nazi, so he can suffer from his deeds, instead of committing suicide. He was intimidating and scary himself. Mark Ruffalo was also very good, he played the partner of Teddy. In the beginning of the movie, I thought he was a made up character by Teddy. (Teddy couldn't find his cigarettes, and Ruffalo had cigarettes, He can't put of his holster, we see his body lying on the cliffs, which isn't there in reality...) Ben Kingsly was good as well, he played the boss of the mental hospital, his character wasn't so clear for me, and with this I mean that I could never figure out to trust him or not. The rest of the supporting cast was did a good job. But the wife of Teddy stood out to me. She was very scary, even horrifying at times, in the beginning she seems innocent, but that changes...The script of the movie is written by Laeta Kalogridis. It was a well written script. The movie is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane. I have read the book called 'The Drop' (this is also filmed with Tom Hardy). This book was written by Lehane, and I liked it, so I was just more excited to go see this movie. But now back to the script. There was some interesting dialogue, especially between Teddy and the woman in the cave, you were so interested to here what they were going to say next. Just one min in the script is that it is confusing at times. But it is also very compelling. I was trying to figure it out myself, which made the movie just more tense. The dialogue between George Noyce was good, and scary too the accentuated sound of the matches, and the whispering of the patients made it more scarier. The ending was not too bad, but also not amazing, you are left with a lot of questions, but this was the meaning of the writer.Anyway I think this was a good movie and that is way it gets a 9.5/10 from me. I would recommend you watching it, if you like scary and tense full movies!",9,1,3,13 December 2015
Interstellar," loved it
","The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper and Anne Hathaway as Brand. Cooper is a talented engineer, but now he is working as a farmer. He does this job together with his son and tractors who he programmed. Oneday his daugther tells him that there is a ghost in the house. The so called 'ghost'gives Cooper coordinates, which lead him to a secret base. In this base he is given the chance to join an expedition to space. Cooper accepts this offer, but he goes to a place in space where 1 hour on that planet is the same as seven years on earth...So as I already have said, this movie stars Mattew McConaughey. He is pretty good in this movie, and I really liked his character. But Anne's character I didn't like as much, I found her rather annoying at sometimes. I really liked TARS and CASE, they is some kind of robots, I tought they were a nice touch. The kid actor of Murph was also good. And now, the special effects and the directing. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan, he is my favorite director. He has made a lot of other good movies, that's one of the reasons I wanted to watch the movie. The special effects are also really good, and I can understand why this movie got his Oscar for it. The dialogue is also amazing. And I really loved the realism of the movie (like the no sound in space stuff)Overall this movie is really good and it has a good plot. Also some good tension between the characters. And at some moments there are some exiting moments. So go watch it and maybe some more of Nolans films.",10,2,5,5 June 2015
American Sniper," pretty enjoyable movie
","The movie follows the live of Chris Kyle, Kyle was the most lethal sniper in U.S. history. The movie starts of kind of lame, it's not a bad beginning, but it could've bin better. In my opinion, I thought the kid actor, who played Chris, couldn't act. that's what bothered me the most. and then when Chris grows up, the movie get's better. Bradly Cooper did a really good acting job, and it surprises me that he didn't get an Oscar for his acting preformens. A thing that also bothered me was that I didn't really got the chance to get to know the characters. Like when Marc and Biggles died, I didn't really feel sad. When I was reading the book and they died, I felt sad. So in my opinion they should have followed the book better up. But what I really liked from the movie was the sound and directing. Clint Eastwood did a fantastic job on directing it, he made every shot look like a piece of art. and the sound was very good, it was good edited, and it sounded really good.So overall i think it is a pretty good movie. I don't know what score I am going to give it, yet. And one last thing, I don't understand why people see this as propaganda. It is the life of a person who served his country. I don't get why this should encourage you to go to the army. In the book he explains better what kind of hell war is. But in the movie you can really see what war has done to him. how he got paranoid and thought that everything was some kind of danger.",8,9,16,15 May 2015
Southpaw," An amazingly well acted boxing film.
","There might be some spoilers in here. Billy Hope was a good boxer, he was the best. But then there happens a tragedy. His wife gets shot. After this event everything goes downhill for him. He can't see his daughter anymore, he loses a lot of his money. After a while he decides that it has been enough, and starts to get back in the ring. To do this he has do be trained again. This time by Tick Willis.The directing and cinematography were handled good. I found that a lot of scenes looked good, but sometimes the cinematographer chose some interesting angles and at times they didn't look that good. What I liked the most was that the director put the camera as the face of the boxer in the fighting scenes, how the camera took the hits or dodged them. This really brought you into the moment just like the slow motion. Due to this you felt more emotion in these scenes which I liked. The fight scenes in the boxing ring were nicely shot, with no shaky cam. But the directing, when Escobar provokes Billy and they start fighting, was a bit all over the place. You couldn't really see what was going on. The tension in the movie was very well. The beginning fighting scene was already tense, just like the last fighting scene. In the end of my review I am going to talk some more about this scene. The boxing is also very realistic. Overall I liked the first part of the movie the most, because there were more clichés in the second part of 'Southpow'The acting of this movie is just mind-blowingly good. Espaccialy from Jake Gyllenhaal. He played Billy Hope, a top boxer who goes through some terrible moments in this movie, the death of his wife, not getting the chance of seeing his daughter. Due to this he also has some anger management issues. By Gyllenhaals performance you can really see how broken Billy is by all this. What I also liked about Gyllenhaal was how he transformed his body into the one of Billy Hope. Just some months after 'Nightcrawler' Where he played a skinny man and now he is this muscular man. The movie also stars Rachel McAdams. She plays the wife of Billy. Even though she is in the movie for a small bit, she was also amazing. 50 cent plays the first manager of Billy, but he switches sides and becomes the manager of Escobar. By 50 Cent's performance I was surprised, because he was really good in 'Southpow'. But the one that surprised me the most is Oona Laurence, she played Leila Hope, the daughter of Billy. How she and Gyllenhaal played together was just nice to look at. Oona was very convincing and she deserves an Oscar nomination for her role. Forest Whitaker who played Tick Willis, the new trainer of Billy. He plays like I said the new trainer of billy, but due to the good acting you can see that he has also done his time. And with this I don't mean that he has been in prison, but that he is also a very damaged person. The writing was not to bad, but it wasn't great either. There were a lot of clichés, like the training montage. But the training montage still had a nice song over it. The story was also kind of predictable. But the writing did do something good. It made you feel bad. When Mo (the wife of Billy) gets killed you immediately feel bad for Billy. And the movie has some other of these sad moments like when they take away his daughter. But for me personally the most sad moment is when his daughter gets mad at him and says that he should have been the one that was shot and not his wife. There is also some stupid dialogue at times, but overall the script was good. Now I am going to talk about the final fighting scene and the ending. The final fighting scene was very tense, but you could already see that Billy was going to win. If you were going to compare it with the fighting scene of 'Warrior', you could say that the one from 'Warrior' was way better, and this was because you kind of cared about the two characters and couldn't find out who was going to win. But the ending was very emotional and tear jerking. Overall I think this is a fun movie, Even though there are some clichés. The acting was amazing and the directing was good. I would definitely recommend this movie if you are a fan of boxing movies.",8,1,2,4 October 2015
Rush," A well crafted movie with fantastic acting!
","The movie 'Rush' is about the rivalry between two racers; James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. We get to see the story from both perspectives and get to know both racers better. But who will be the number one racer? Hunt or Lauda?So that was my little synopsis of the movie now let's talk about the directing, cinematographing and some other 'technical' stuff in this paragraph. Let's start with the directing. Ron Howard has directed the movie and he did a very good job at it. With Howard it's most of the time a hit or miss. Howard has made good movies like 'A Beautiful mind' but also bad movies like 'The Da Vinci Code' (eventhough it was based on something good) This time it was definitely a hit. He used some good camera movements and long takes. The long takes were not that often present. But I still think it deserves a mention. He did a good job at the racing sequences, but at times this was a bit to fast paced for my taste and you couldn't really see which was which. The cinematography was pretty good. It was way better than the last movie I saw, in fact, everything is better than that movie, but I wouldn't call the cinematography fantastic or Oscar-worthy. It was just really good. This was done by Anthony Dod Mantle. Let's continue with some visual aspects. The CGI and make-up. The CGI-crash of Lauda was really good. It was very convincing and very near to the real crash. This brings me to the make-up of Lauda his face after the crash. Wow. This was done fantastic. It was hard to watch, so hard that I even switched to the next tablat. But the amazing sound choice didn't make it less gross. The sound design was done very well. The editing of this too. The soundtrack was fantastic, but I wouldn't expect anything less of Hans Zimmer. The editing too was done good.The acting now. I will talk about the two protagonists James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. Lat's also talk about them in that order. Hunt was played by Chris Hemsworth. Hunt was a playboy and a complacent asshole. Hemsworht absolutely nailed the part. He was very convincing and on the plus side, he also looks very similar too the real James Hunt. He may sound like a very annoying character but no. He wasn't annoying at all. Thanks to the fantastic writing you care for him. We see that he has his own problems. His drinking problem, and how his playboy characteristic backfires. His counterpart and also protagonist is Lauda played by Daniel Brühl. He was way better than Hemsworht in the role. Brühls accent was really convincing and I thought that he really came from there his acting may have looked stiff, but that's where they were going for. This fitted the character of Lauda perfectly. Brühl was cast perfectly. His appearance wasn't as close to his real counterpart as Hemsworth was, but the fantastic acting weighs up. Lauda is a smart man who uses his intelligence to beat Hunt in comprising to Hunt who doesn't think about his actions and just does them. This brings forward some very good dialogue.With that last sentence I will go over to the last 'Big' paragraph of my review. The script will be discussed in this part. Peter Morgan was responsible for this. And credit to him, because he did a fantastic job at it, in case you didn't notice from my last paragraph. The dialogue overall was good, but the dialogue between Lauda and Hunt was really good. The chemistry and friction between them made this only better, but this was of course thanks to the amazing acting capabilities of both actors. The way the story was told was also very good. It was a good choice to switch between both perspectives and show both characters imperfections. Doing this they made the characters more real. All of the characters were also well developed due to this. And thanks to all of these things combined you get sucked into the story and get invested into it. The film overall was very thrilling, surprisingly this was thanks to the directing but also editing the score and actually everything combined. But it is much more than just a sport film. It's a gripping movie with a meaning and fantastic characters. The movie makes you care about them and understand their actions. But as I've said: It's much more than that. Due to the things I've just said in the previous paragraph I will definitely recommend this movie to anyone! Even if they are not interested in F1, just like me, because the movie will pull you in and make you interested. The movie is also overall well crafted, as said in my title. That's why this movie get's an 9.25/10.",9,0,1,2 July 2016
The Revenant," A beautiful shot, and well acted movie!
","The Revenant. In this movie, we meet Hugh Glass. He is a frontiersman. Together with a group, they are on a hide- hunt. But due to a series of events, Hugh gets attacked by a bear. After this attack he gets left behind for death by his crew members, and kill his son, now he is out for revenge for the one who left him behind and killed Hawk... (Hawk is the name of the son)Let me start this part of my review of with saying that this was a goddamn beautiful movie.The director of 'The Revenant' is Alejandro González Iñárritu. Last year, as I said in my 'Birdman'-review, he was a unknown man for me. He has this special style, and I really like it. There were a lot of spectacular scenes in the movie. (More on this later) The cinematography is so, so pretty. The landscape was brought into a beautiful picture. The editing was great to, which brings me back to the scenes. My favorite scene of the movie was the first attack scene. They made it look like it was one long take, without any cuts. Alejandro González Iñárritu did this to with 'Birdman'. But the brilliant aspect of this was, that there really are cuts, just hidden away, using CGI, or just skillful editing. Using this technique, they create a lot of tension. This scene also brings all the characters together. Due all of these reasons, this was my favorite scene. Throughout the movie, you can see more of these scenes (like the final scene, in the end, i'll talk some more about it). The costumes were well done. They looked worn out, and old. The make-up, looked fine. It wasn't easy to look at the wounds of DiCaprio, but the scars looked at moments not too good. The lighting was maybe one of the more impressive aspects of the movie. It was very good, but they only used real lighting! This includes fires, sunlight, etc. The music is the next topic i am going to discus. In 'Birdman' there was a lot of very good music. So I went into this movie expecting the same, unfortunately I didn't get it. It was still well chosen music, but not as good as in 'Birdman'. The sound was good as well. The set design now. Well, there weren't really a lot of sets. It were almost all nature-sets. The set that was there, was the camp of the other frontiers. This looked very realistic to me.The acting. This was amazing. Please, give Leonardo DiCaprio just an Oscar already! This guy was amazing as Hugh Glass. He keeps surprising me, with his acting talent. He didn't have a lot of lines, but his facial expressions, was already enough. The antagonist of this story is nature, but also Tom Hardy. Hardy played Fitzgerald. He was the person who killed the son of Hugh, and left Hugh for death. His character was the most interesting for me. He manipulates persons. Even right before he starts to fight with Glass. He starts trying to convince him, that he wasn't lying after all. He was good too, so he can get an Oscar too! :) No, I am just kidding, he was good, but I don't think that it was Oscar worthy. Another crew member was Bridger. Will Poulter played him. By his acting performance I was really surprised. Also by the screen time he had. I wasn't expecting that he would have such a big role in the story. His character was like ably. You felt sorry for him, when they beat him, because of something that he hasn't done. Like I have said I was surprised by his performance, because it was very good. Normally I am annoyed by his acting jobs, but this time I luckily wasn't. The leader of this crew is called Captain Andrew Henry, played by Domhnall Gleeson. Gleeson seems to appear in every movie I see. First 'Ex Machina' then 'Star Wars', and now here. But anyway, he was very good too. The supporting cast, was well. The one that stood out to me was the actor of Hawk, Glass' son. Forrest Goodluck played him.The script was written by the director himself, and Mark L. Smith. The story was good, but not for everyone. There were some boring elements, and that's why I think a lot of people won't like the movie. The dialogue was good, even though there wasn't a lot. That was also a very impressive part. They managed to keep the story interesting, even with almost no one talking. This also kept me interesting, due to Leo's Fantastic acting. But now something more about the ending. This was also shot in almost one take, which made it very tensfull. The fighting was gritty, which fitted the theme of the movie. It was realistic as well. It was unpredictable, I wasn't really sure if Glass would win. Another 'bad' thing was the fact that they tried to put in the thoughts of Glass. I didn't really mind, but I can understand that some people will. I think that this was a thing to make us understand Glass better.But overall this was a beautiful shot movie, with fantastic acting, and some good writing. It is not a movie for everyone, but I would still recommend watching this movie.8,5/10",9,0,1,30 January 2016
Hugo," A good kids movie that will entertain a more mature audience as well!
","'Hugo' is about the titular character who lives in a train-station where he is doing the job that his dad used to do: fixing clocks. He gets to know this old shop owner, where after a chain of mysteries gets put in front of him.'Hugo' was directed by the well-known master of cinema Martin Scorsesse. He is one of the best directors working today and all of the films I've seen of him have been good. You'd expect that he would maybe produce something worse with a movie who's target audience is children, but with 'Hugo' he'll prove you wrong. He used some impressive long takes in this movie, like in the beginning and ending. The beginning scene was very CGI-heavy, which I didn't really like, but I understand why they had to do that. The CGI looked very fake, and I don't really understand why the movie got an Oscar for this part. The scene overall was good (the camera movements etc.), but the CGI was really off-putting, whereby I thought that the whole movie would be like this: CGI filled. Luckily this wasn't the case and was the other uses of CGI more subtle and worked better. Like for example the train sequence, there the CGI was way better than in the beginning, because there wasn't an overflow of it. The end scene was filmed very impressively. I saw a behind the scenes video of it, which only made the scene even better and more surprising that they even were able to pull it of.The score was nicely composed and created by Howard Shore. The movie was also beautifully filmed. Each shot was nicely framed and looked good. This was done by Robert Richardson, who had previously worked with Scorsesse in 'Shutter Island', where he also proved his talent. The costume design I found to be good. It really helped to create a feel to the movie, and it also made the movie look more like it was set in the early 30'.The acting was good even from the young actor and actress. Let's first talk about the protagonist of the story: Hugo. Hugo was played by Asa Butterfield. An actor who has showed multiple times that he is a fantastic kid actor. One example Is 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas'. In this movie too he gives a good performance, not as good as in the previously named film, but still pretty good, especially for a kid. Sometimes I found that the emotion he showed with his face, didn't match the emotion he put into his voice. Other times he did this perfectly and really showed his full emotion. His Co-star was Chloë Grace Moretz. She was also very good, better than Asa in this movie. Ben Kingsley played her uncle. He gave one of the best performances in the film. He was really able to portray how his character felt and we were able to feel with him, thanks to Kingsley's brilliant performance. Jude Law, for the screen time he got, was excellent. I very much liked him in the film. And last but not least I want to mention Sacha Baron Cohen. He played someone totally different from his other characters, and it worked. He was funny and acted it out very well. He was more of the comic relief for the children, but it really worked, because the jokes that were made were good for all ages and not just stupid fart jokes. The screenplay was really well written. The story was interesting and not predictable. It sets up a little adventure that reminds you of what it's like to be a child. The story also was well constructed and by the use of flashbacks it also sets up the character of Hugo. I only have one really complaint about the screenplay and this is that at the end of the movie everything gets explained fairly obviously. I liked the twist that they put in there and that they teach the younger audience about film, but I just would've liked a more subtle approach better. I hope that this encourages kids to go watch movies of Georges Méliès, because that's where it all started. You also don't really have to know a lot of movies to understand what they are talking about, which is also a good thing. Like I've said before, the jokes were funny, and that's a good part thanks to the screenplay. There was some slapstick, but also some verbal humor. Sometimes I think that the jokes would go over the heads of children, but I think that that's a good thing, because by this you can keep the more mature audience entertained. I also liked the fact that there were some small side stories going on. Those too were funny and set up in a nice manner, whereby the added to the story and weren't just some useless images to fill up the time span of the movie. In the end I found 'Hugo' to be a good movie. It had a mix of things that adults could enjoy and that kids could enjoy, whereby the movie really becomes a good kids movie. The movie also teaches some things about early cinema which I very much enjoyed and also the way it was integrated into the movie fitted very well. 8.4/10",8,1,3,29 December 2016
Saving Private Ryan," America, stop spending money to get Damon home :)
","The movie starts off with an epic opening scene. In this scene Captain Miller and his squad have to take over the beach. During this 'invasion' two brothers are killed. Their third brother is also also killed of, but in New Guinea. After they have taken over the beach, Captain Miller and his crew get another task. They have to find private Ryan. The fourth brother. He is the only remaining brother, so Miller has to get him and bring him back to his mother. It turns out to be harder than they taught. 'Saving Ptivate Ryan' is directed by Steven Spielberg. He did an amazing job at directing this movie. He did something special, he made it seem like the main characters stood out. It looked like they took a black and white movie and colored it in, it gave a pretty effect. The cinematography was also perfectly handled. Janusz Kaminski has worked a couple of times with Spielberg, I get why Spielberg had chosen him as the cinematographer. The opening scene (with this I mean the opening fight scene) was just shot amazing. Every shot was just stunningly beautiful. The set design look realistic, The effects in this scene were flawless. You were tense, even though you didn't got the chance to know the characters yet. Everything was fantastic. The realism of the movie was also good. When the camera goes under water in the beginning scene, the sound mutes. This really makes you feel like you are there, with the soldiers. Also, still when the camera is under water, when the bullets hit the water, they slow down and you can see the path that they make through the water. When someone takes a grenade, and they explode, they literally blow up into peaces, you can see body parts fly everywhere. What is also good about this movie are the effects and Make-Up . In the movie there is a lot of gore. And when someone loses a leg or a piece of their skin and there intestines are shown, it is in the movie, it looks so real. And after the first battle sequence the camera flies by the battlefield, and you can see all the dead body's and the water, that has become red of the blood of the soldiers, this was a very touching scene. The acting in this movie was also very good, everybody did their best. Lets star of with the main character. The main character is Captain Miller, played by Tom Hanks. Miller is the Captain of his squad, a little bit further on in the review i am going to talk about the squad. He is a broken man due to the war, but there is one thing that keeps him going, completing the mission and to keep his squad alive. Someone else from his squad is Caparzo. He is played by, believe me or not, Vin Diesel. I really didn't recognize him. I was surprised that it was him, he was so good in this movie, I just couldn't believe it. There is also Jeremy Davies he plays Upham. He was also very good. You can really see how afraid that he is of war. Wade, the medic of the crew, is played by Giovanni Ribisi. He was good too. And when he dies, there follows a painful silences and that was hard to watch. Not because it was a bad scene or something, no, it was just such a sad moment. There is also Mellish, played by Adam Goldberg, he was good, nothing special about him. And Horvath is played by Tom Sizemore. When he died at the end I didn't feel sad, and I don't know why. In the squad there is also Jackson. He is played by Barry Pepper. He was a very skilled sniper, and it was shocking to see him die, when he got blown up. And last but not least, Matt Damon. He played Private Ryan, the soldier that Miller has to get back home. I liked his character a lot he is a loyal friend, who is not willing to leave his crew behind. This covers most of the characters, I am sorry if I have missed one, there are a lot of characters in this movie. The writing of the movie was handled perfectly. There were funny bits. But that doesn't change the mood of the movie, it keeps it's darker tone. You could really feel the friendship of the crew and this was due to the good writing. What I also liked about the writing, even though this does not relate much to th writing, is when Miller goes away to cry. This was a powerful scene, and gave the character a more relatable person, it made him feel more real.The part that i loved a bit more than the beginning fight scene is the final fight scene. I loved watching how they prepared themselves and the bridge for an upcoming attack. The whole 'Bridge' scene is just so tense full. And when they finally attack, you just start screaming at your screen, because Upham, doesn't dare to do something. Becaude of him some characters died, that he could have saved. But when the battle is over, and he has his gun pointed at some German soldiers. He recognizes a soldier. It is the soldier that killed Wade. When Wade was killed they let that soldier go, but first they are planning to kill him. Then at a certain point Upham says 'what is happening' when they want to shoot the unarmed German soldier. And I think that he means with this what happened to us, how war has changed them, this is a positive thing. But when he holds the gun pointed at the German soldiers, he pulls the trigger and kills the man, out of revenge. Also a powerful scene.The ending is beautiful. I would recommend watching this movie.",10,2,3,18 October 2015
Gone Girl," Fincher did it again
","Before you read this review just keep in mind that I have read the book and that I enjoyed the book and the movie.So gone girl is about Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick(Ben Affleck). They are a happy married couple for the outside world. one day Amy gets missing and Nick has to help the police to help finding his wife. You get to see the movie from two perspectives: Nick's perspective and Amy's perspective, but Amy's is a bit more interesting than Nick's because Amy's perspective is her diary. Just like the tag line: there are three sides of a story: her side, his side and the truth (my favorite tag line by the way)Now that I have told brief what this movie is about, I will talk about the acting writing and directing. But first the directing. Like I have said in the title of my review: Fincher did it again. Because he did. The directing was just fantastic. He filmed it with a darker tone, something like zodiac, just a tone lighter. This style really helped with the tone of the movie in general. The acting and writing of the movie was also amazing. Ben Affleck did a very good job at portraying Nick Dunne. But Rosamund Pike just blew the part, she was the best and just like I imagined Amy. A very dark and psychotic person who framed her husband for her own movie. I really liked the part when the viewer realized that Amy is alive and planed all of this, I of course saw this coming, but it was also very well executed in the movie. Tyler perry was really good and it is his best movie in a while, think about Alex cross, the books were amazing, but the movie really sucked. the actress of Margo (Carrie Coon) was pretty good, just not as I imagined Margo, but still she was good. Neil Patrick Harris was just perfect as Desi. Really liked the scene where he gets killed, because the scene was very well acted, directed and also very, very scary. Here you see again the psychotic side of Amy. This scene is very gory and bloody so if you can't handle bloody parts, you should skip this part. David Clennon was funny as the dad of Nick, and was very accurate if you compare him to the book.Something that I really liked of the movie was that they stayed very true to the book and I like the characters too. they are all very interesting, especially Amy. This is something that Gillian Flynn didn't keep in her other books ('Sharp Objects' and 'Dark Places') don't get me wrong, I really liked the other books too but 'Gone Girl' was definitely the best book of Flynn's novels.This movie is also pretty clever. Look at the clues Amy left, and also the plan Amy had. When I was reading the book I didn't see all of that coming and was pleasantly surprised. But here are some individual scores:Directing: 10/10Acting: 9.5/10Writing: 9/10Trilling: 9.5/10Ending: 9.5/10That is a total of 47.5/50 which is rounded a 10/10. I really liked this movie and I would definitely recommend this to people who like thrillers who are clever and psychotic.",10,0,5,28 July 2015
Mr. Nobody," A simple story told in a complicated way, but still manages to stay fantastic.
","The hard part of this review is writing the synopsis, but I'll try. We meet Nemo Nobody, who is put into a difficult decision. Leave with his mom, or stay with his dad. He chose both. No we see all different time lines that could've been. (This is the best I could come up with)The director comes from Belgium, which I didn't know at first, and is called Jaco Van Dormael. He has created probably the only good Belgian movie, that I've seen. I am from Belgium myself, and trust me, we don't make a lot of good movies. Sometimes we get recognized for some movies like the Oscar nomination for 'Broken circle breakdown', and also for 'Bullhead'. Schoenaarts became popular in Hollywood due to that movie, but I'm drifting away. Van Dormael did a fantastic job at directing the movie. He has a special technique, and I like that. He has put a lot of effort in the movie, which you can clearly see. Van Dormael tried to be experimental at times, and also succeeded at it. But the part that I found really cool is how he handled the focus. Normally they just use it so you know where your attention is supposed to be. In this movie they use it to create a more mysterious look, but it also makes a pretty shot. Of course the directing isn't the only good thing about this movie, so let's move on. The cinematography was done good as well. This was done by Christophe Beaucarne. Another thing that stood out to me was the editing. This was also thanks to the great director. There were a lot of shots (the marriage sequences in example) where this was used to give a nice flow from changing scenes. This can also be see, when Nemo and Anna are making out, and the camera starts to turn around them, where after they lay down on the bed. It's hard to describe in words, but if you've seen the movie, I think you'll understand me.This movie isn't prefect, but that's just me nitpicking, so let's start with the nitpicking, even though it's just one thing I want to say here. The make-up for old Jared Leto. It looked fine for me, but it looked also like just another layer of a sort of rubber put on him. So I can understand why some people will see this as an issue.No I'll talk a bit about the acting. Keep in mind that I won't go over everyone, and mostly do the adult actors. Let's start with the main character. The main character is 'cleverly' called Nemo Nobody. And I said 'Cleverly' because Nemo is nobody in Latin. This was a fun little easter egg. Nemo was played by Jared Leto, but also by Toby Regbo and Thomas Byrne. They were all good, but like I've said, I'll mainly focus on the adult actors. Leto also played the 100 year old Nemo, and with this part I have an issue. The voice he used. His body language was very good, but the voice just really didn't sound right. Also the laugh at the end of the movie was very weird, I know that it was supposed to be backwards. The next person is one of his wives, well sort of, and also his stepsister... This was Anna, as adult she was played by Diane Kruger. Of course there were again child actresses. She was good, just like the other actresses. One of his other wives is Elise, as an adult she was played by Sarah Polley. She too was good. From her we saw a more emotional side, which she handled very well. The last of his wives was Jean. Linh Dan Pham played her. We didn't get to see a lot of her, but for the parts she had, she was good. I'll stop this part of my review here, because you might have noticed that I've used the word 'good' a lot. That's because everyone in this movie acted good. See there is it again. That's why I'll stop, because It might get a bit repetitive.Now let's talk a bit about the screenplay. This was written by the director himself. And hats of to him. He did a good job at it. The story is told in a non-linear way. This could have been a disaster of a mess, but he has created a very well crafted movie. He managed to give the movie a deep meaning about choices, and it makes you rethink some things. He uses the butterfly effect too in the movie. This is actually a very big part of the movie, and it was cool to see it handled so well in a movie. The dialogue was good too. But a thing I liked the most on this part of the movie is the character of Nemo. It's written in such a way, that his character changes in every different 'timeline', this is due to the good writing. The only thing that really bothered me was the twist at the end. It all takes place inside of the nine year old boys head. Even though this is a sad moment in the movie, and also heartbreaking, I thought that he could've come up with a better twist.But in the end 'Mr. Nobody' is a fantastic movie that everyone should check out.9.25/10",9,2,4,10 April 2016
22 Jump Street," the first one was better
","This movie is the sequel to 21 jump street. I liked the first one more because it was just a bit funnier. But this movie is again about some kind of drug. But this time at a college. At college Jenko meets Zook. Jenko and Schmidt and Jenko have to find the dealer of the drug and stop him. The only clue they have is a tattoo. Than there are some bromance moments. The acting was good, it wasn't amazing, but I thought that Ice Cube. And it surprised me. Jonah Hill was also pretty good. Channing Tatum was OK. I personally find that he was just there to be funny. And it worked. The directing was also OK, it could have been better if Nolan dit it or Fincher. The script was also pretty funny. The thing that I liked is that the movie laughed with itself. They often say that it is repetitive and stuff. Or like the mission is exactly the same as the previous one. The lines while they are fighting are funny. Something else that is funny is the contrast between Schmidt and Jenko. Jenko is very sportive and good at parcour. In contrast to Schmidt, he's lazy and not active at all. (you may see this as a spoiler) The ending when they blow something up is also pretty funny. The end credit scene is also very funny.Here are some individual scores:directing: 8/10acting: 8.5/10creativity: 9.5/10jocularity: 9.5/10that's 35.5/40 which is rounded 9/10",9,0,4,17 June 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The less amazing spider-man
","In the second installment of the reboot we have the following story, which is... I have no clue. There are to many sub story lines, but the main one is about Electro fighting with Spider-Man. I believe...This movie is directed by the same director of the first movie. He is called, ironically, Marc Webb. He poorly directed this movie, the previous one he did way better. In this one you can see that he didn't put any effort in the movie. He also used a lot of lens flares, and angled shots. These look ugly combined. Very ugly, and he uses them a lot. I can't remember if this is used in the first movie. The cinematography isn't that great too. I just didn't find myself thinking that it was shot nicely. The editing wasn't good too. You can see this in the beginning of the movie, with the chase scene. They think that they create a lot of tension with quickly edited scenes, but it doesn't. It really doesn't. In this scene we also meet Rhino and Electro. This was the beginning of an overcrowded movie. There is also a use of shaky cam. Also in the beginning of the movie, but this time in the airplane scene. Here they probably used it, because this is one of the only fight scenes I think they used real people. Shaky cam is also a technique to create 'tension' with me it only creates anger. It's so obnoxious, and every director of mindless action movies uses it. Which says enough. The director also likes his slow motion. This was overused. The scenes in slow motion looked like they were created by a computer, which they were, but it didn't look good. You can also clearly notice that the movie is produced/made by Sony, there is lot's of product placement. A lot. The acting fine. Well, for the most part. Let's start with the main character. Peter Parker, or as we also know him, Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield played him. I think that he was a good casting choice. He was good, I liked him. Then we have his girlfriend, sort of, Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone. I liked her too, but just not her relationship with Peter, and I will touch on this subject later. The bad acted roles come now. But let me say first, these are not bad actors, they are good in some movies, but the director just didn't directed them good enough. The first one I will discuss, is also the main villain. Electro, played by Jamie Fox. He overacted his roles as Max. It was mostly funny to watch. The other villain was the green goblin. He was played by Dane Dehaan. Dehaan has done good movies where he was good in ('Chronicle' or 'the place beyond the pines'), but in this movie he made the same mistake as Fox. He overacted. Also about the part where you can see this the most, I will discuss in a bit. The writing is the biggest problem of the movie. Everything is way too convenient. But let's first go to the dialogue. This was just plain bad. The love dialogue was cringe worhty. But overall there were some dumb moments in the dialogue. There is literally a scene where Gwen says that she is okay with Peter stalking her. WHAT THE F*CK. Why would you ever be fine with that? What? But not just in the dialogue. For example the filthy face scene, or the cheesy hero-montage. And one of the funny things is, is that they try to be emotional at times. It's just so funny to watch. An example of this is the appearance of the dad of Gwen, or the death of Osborn. But to come back to the relationship between Gwen an Peter. It feels like it is written by a 12 year old. But now to touch on some other things. There are a lot of clichés in this movie. German professor? check. References pushed right in your face? check. Love hate relationship? check... The list goes on. ANd like I said there are a lot of conveniences. All of the characters conveniently meet each other. But that's not the only thing, there are other things but these will come. My problem with Electro/Max is of course the acting, but also the origin story, it was so bad it was funny, and this was also due to the acting. But his motive to hate Spider-Man is stupid. In five seconds he goes from loving him to hating him. But I hated Green Goblin. When he transformed in to him, it was also funny to watch. But the worst part, and convenient part comes with the costume. I just appears. He immediately knows how to use it, and what all his gadgets are. What? come on! The story overall sucked, it tried to be to much, but failed at it. Oh and I last thing. Why does Electro create music when he hits the electric poles at the end? What the F*ck!Thank you for reading this review of the horrible Spider-Man movie.1/10",1,7,20,3 April 2016
Ex Machina," Ex Machina
","Ex Machina is about Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) Caleb has won a competition. Now he can go to somewhere where he can work with a drank addict, who is also a genius. This drank addict is played by Oscar Isaac. Nathan (the drank addict) has developed an AI. Caleb has to work and test this AI. After a while Caleb falls in love with Ava (this is how they called the AI) due this there follow lots of sexual dialogue. At first I was OK with this part but after a while you are like, OK we get it she can have sexual feelings to. And they stop with it, luckily. The movie is directed by Alex Garland. He also wrote the script for this movie. He did the best he can. By the way, this is the first movie he has ever directed. I liked the directing, there were some scenes that were good, and others that were just beautiful.Some more about the acting, writing and plot. The acting was good. I really liked Oscar Isaac. With his short temper and angry behavior, it was very good acted. He is like this dark character, because Ava tells Caleb at a certain point that he can not trust Nathan, after this point Oscars character gets more mysterious. Gleeson was OK, didn't like his acting that much and I really liked Alicia Vikander. She played Ava. She did very well acting like a sort of robot, but still with some human things in her. Her lines are also very well written. the writing was over all also pretty good.The plot was also good and in the middle of the movie, they took a huge twist, what scared me really good, from this point the movie kept on going darker. I am not going to go in depth about this part, because I want to keep this review spoiler free. They tried to put some funny parts in it (like the dancing scene) but it didn't really work for me, and that is something I didn't like. But there is this part that I really liked, and that is the part where Caleb and Nathan are sitting under a wooden shelter in the woods. It has some good dialogue and that is the part I liked. Near the end of the movie there are a couple of twist and that is also something fun.Onerall I think the movie is pretty good and here are some individual scores like I do with every of my reviews since my birdman review:Directing: 8.5/10Acting: 8/10Writing: 8/10Plot: 9/10That is a total of 33.5/40, which is rounded 8/10",8,1,3,25 June 2015
Children of Men," Shantih, Shantih, Shantih!
","'Children of Men' is set in 2027, where all women are infertile. But then Theo get's approached by an old friend of his, who wants him to reignite the flame of his activism and help her to bring the one pregnant women to safety.That was my little synopsis of the movie. Now I'll discuss the more thecnical side of the film. First the directing. Alfonso Cuarón was responsible for this. He did a very good job at it. He used hand- held camera throughout the movie, which I generally don't like, but his use of it, felt so natural and fitted with the rough theme of the movie. Cuarón also used long takes, which created these beautiful scenes. The tension was built and he showed the background more in those longer scenes, so you could get a better feel of the movie. One of my favorite scenes of the movie was one of these long takes. The one I'm talking about is where Theo, Julian, Kee, Luke and Miriam are sitting in the car and get ambushed. I have a little analysis of that scene at the end of my review. Alfonso Cuarón was also able to bring a good chock factor to the movie. He did this in various ways, but most notably, for me at least, is the scene where Jasper get's shot. In that scene he let's the gunshot echo through the forst, just like our reaction hangs around for a bit. There is a lot to say about that scene, but I already have one scene analysis, which is enough for this review. The editing was also very well handled. In the long takes, there were probably cuts (I wasn't able to spot any, but there obviously were some hidden with cgi), but the fact that I wasn't able to spot any is a sign of good editing. If you are a more experienced movie-goer than me, you would probably notice them, though. The soundtrack was remarkable. It stood in contrast with the often references to older pieces of art, that were also visualized in some scenes. The acting was magnificent. Clive Owen, who played Theo, gave his best performance yet. He was absolutely remarkable. I can't comprehend why he didn't even get an Oscar nod. He gave so much extra to his character and he was a charismatic hero. He achieved well in the emotional scenes. Not only Clive Owen was good, but Julianne Moore too. She was marvelous in her role, except I would've liked to see her more in the movie, just because she was so good. The chemistry between her and Clive Owen worked very well, and gave a fantastic on-screen romance. Michael Caine played something different that I'm used from him, and I've got to admit that this is one of his most amusing roles I've seen him in. He was funny and acted the part flawlessly. The actress of Kee, Clare-Hope Ashitey, too was good. The actors that I haven't mentioned were mostly good. There wasn't someone who did a bad job, or someone who broke the immersion.The screenplay was written by a lot of people, so I had my doubts with it. Most of the time when it's written by that many, it turns out badly. But it turned out good this time. This wasn't the part of the movie, that stood out to me. The story was simple, but effective and the characters were good. You cared about the main character due to a lot of subtle character development. The dialogue felt very natural and didn't feel out of place at all. The story progressed well and the villains of the movie had a good reason to hunt down Kee. This shows both ways to view a situation. The jokes were good and never got old. Micheal Caines line delivery for those jokes was on point.And here to end my review is my analysis. This scene (the car scene) stood out in particular, because of the fantastic cinematography and tension-building. The cinematography in that scene reached that level of goodness, because it constantly managed to keep the framing right. You'd expect that some pieces of that scene were ugly-looking, due to the lack of movement for the cameraman, but this wasn't the case. The tension-building was also something that I mentioned This is because the build up to the action was done brilliantly. Alfonso Cuarón first showed us that Theo and Julian were really close before - we knew this already, but here he explores it a bit more - and he also shows them in quite a relaxed state. But then the flaming cars roles down, and panic starts to occur. The beep of the car works as the tension-building score on it's own: the high monotone pitch. Now, because you are more invested with the characters, you are on the edge of your seat, because you don't want anything to happen to them. Then, terror happens. From loud noises we go to silence with the beep tone again. Just to show the contrast again, just like before. Then: peace to violence. Now: loud noises to silence. But when you think it's over, the cops arrive as well. Everything seems to be going fine, but then Luke shoots them. This comes as shock, because we were thinking it was going to go well. Luke asked for the passports, so you'd think that it would just go by, without any problem. The brilliant part of the scene is also that it doesn't need any music to build up tension. It needs visuals and that's something that I found very impressive. So that was my review and analysis of the movie. It was a very well directed and acted one, with fantastic long takes, who immerse you into the film even more. Alfonso Cuarón created a world, that was believable and harsh. 9.5/10",10,0,0,4 November 2016
The Imitation Game," Awesome
","The imitation game is about the life of Alan Turing. Turing was a brilliant boy. He helped cracking a Nazi code. Turing is played by Bennedict Cumberbatch who did an amazing job. Keira Knightleiy was also amazing acting preformace. I really loved her character.The plot of the movie is really good and well executed. It surprised me that it was based on a true story. And it made me feel sadder when I realized that Alan really committed suicide. And that gay people where handled like thát, is just horribleBut now something more about the script. I absolutely loved the scrip. The begin line of Bennedict was a really good start of the movie. The lines said by the kid actor who portraits Alan are also really good. The kid actor is also something I liked, because the kid actor is a really good actor for his age.The directing is just... Wow. The director made the movie so beautiful. If I have to say something that bothered me (but didn't make the movie worse) where the special effects, like the planes and stuff. But the bombed city looked good. And now my favorite parts of the movie. The moment when they made Christopher work, and the figured everything out where so good.Overall this is an amazing movie and I recommend watching it.",10,0,3,30 May 2015
Prisoners," Why didn't it get any Oscars?
","there are some things in this review you could see as spoilers.'Prisoners' is about Dover Keller. A caring and loving father with a daughter and a son. The movie starts of with Kellers family and Franklins having a thanksgiving celebration. This beginning gives a light tone to the movie. But it also gives you a warm feeling. Keller then tells his daughter and the daughter of Franklin that they should go and play in the basement. Hereafter the camera focuses on a tree while zooming in on it and there is scary movie on the background. (I know it sounds stupid but it is beautifully shot) After this scene you know that there is something wrong. And there is, both girls have disappeared. They have been kidnapped. Keller has to be one himself to find the girls, but that doesn't come with no trouble...The directing of the movie is just amazing, every shot was beautiful. The director (Denis Villeneuve) chose nice angles to shoot from and I also like that he used almost no hand held camera's. The realistic feel to the movie was also a fun feature. An example is the torture scene. This is a very thrilling scene, and this is due to the realistic tune. Like the make-up on the beaten face, and the blood on the knuckles of Keller. Very much enjoyed that the movie kept you on the edge of your seat during the entire movie. The cinematography of the movie was also amazing. The cinematographer was Roger Deakings. But I didn't really like the ending. It was an open ending and I never really like those. Nolan does these things normally too in his movies, but I don't mind it in his because the story has ended. In this movie you still are wondering how it goes on and you don't have that with Nolans movies. But 'prisoners' was still goodThe acting in 'Prisoners' was just flawless. Hugh Jackman as Dover Keller was very convincing as a loving dad. When he beats Alex Jones you can see the hate in his eyes, but there is also regret. This a way better performance by Jackman than in Wolverine. His character is very well written and due this you can also see how determined he is to find the two little girls. Jake Gyllenhaal was just amazing as a cop. But this wasn't really a surprise. You can see that he really wants to find the two girls but is hold back by the rules. This is something Keller doesn't seem to follow... Paul Dano as Alex was just the perfect casting choice. I just adored his character. He was the best written and developed character of the entire movie it was also brilliant acted. Even the child actors were good. Dylan Minnette as the son of Dover was really good. I very much liked the scene in the beginning of the movie where he and Eliza are talking about hunting, it was a very well written scene just like the entire movie. Terrance Howerd gave a very good performance. And Maria Bello was also very good as a worried and desperate mother. The script of the movie is just brilliantly written. And the last person I am going to talk about is Melissa Leo. She was just so good. She played an innocent women who is the mother of Alex.But now something more about the ending. I know that I have said that I didn't really like I, But the is just the final minutes. Because the last 30 minutes were very thrilling and exciting. I very much enjoyed the twist in the end. They made you think throughout the movie that Alex did it or Bob, but it turns out to be someone else. I really didn't see that twist coming.But overall this is an amazing movie and I am really surprised that it didn't get any Oscars. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.",10,1,2,14 September 2015
Logan," A good ending to Hugh Jackman's take on Wolverine
","'Logan is the final installment in the so called Wolverine trilogy. In this film we meet Logan as a more damaged and depressed man, who's given the task to bring this little mutant to a place called Eden. James Mangold, the man behind the second film in the Wolverine trilogy, 'The Wolverine' came back to direct this film. In this film he has proved again that he is a very good visual director. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful with some good use of lighting and color creating very good looking shots throughout the whole film. He didn't only succeed at the visual aspect, but also at the action sequences. They were fast paced, yet easy to follow and also tense full. The pacing overall in the film is really good just in the second act it starts to become a bit slower, but I didn't mind, because the time is well spent. Mangold wasn't the greatest at making the character building scenes as interesting as they could've been, but they nonetheless were pretty good. The CGI wasn't noticeable, but was there and thus pretty good.The acting was formidable. Hugh Jackman was born to play the character of Wolverine, just like Robert Downey Jr. was for Iron Man and Ryan Reynolds for Deadpool, and gave his all in all of the films in which he played said character, but in 'Logan', he outdoes himself. He really showed how great of an actor he is. He managed to indulge himself into the character. He looked damaged and depressed and managed to convince me that he was the Wolverine. But not only Hugh Jackman was good. So was his counterpart Dafne Keen. She, especially since her age, was fantastic. She maybe even had one of the biggest challenges, because her character doesn't say anything for around two thirds of the film. She was equally as badass to watch on screen as Hugh Jackman. The two of them made a fun action duo and also had chemistry between them. I liked the fact that their bound grew throughout the whole film and I'd love to see her as the new Wolverine and not just a recast. Patrick Stewart was also great as professor X and the actor of the villain I found to be good as well.The screenplay was pretty good as well, containing a simple, but effective story , which branched off into much more on the way. The characters were probably the best part of the film, because they have all developed since we got to know them in the original X-men. Logan has become broken down and sick, Charles has aged and has developed a brain disease. I like that throughout the film we get to know more about why Charles is like he is and that he too is a damaged man when he realizes that he killed seven mutants due to his brain disease. Developments like these are hidden throughout the film and are never really pushed into your face. This film utilized those developments and created a sad, depressing film, in which it succeeded without a doubt. The characters were all very well rounded and I found myself caring for them. They all had their depth, unlike in some X-men films, where they solely support on the acting capabilities of the actors. In this film the acting was just the cherry on top. And because of these well-crafted characters, each death was painful to watch. Even the character of X-23 was very good and Dafne nailed her portrayal. She was skeptical with everything that was happening and only trusted in Logan, even though she didn't always show that. The character was quite complex for such a young actress to portray, but I think that she nailed it perfectly. I myself was quite skeptical as well, because of the fact that they gave an unheard-of kid actor a major role in such a serious film, but after seeing the film I'm happy that they chose Dafne to play X- 23. The screenplay wasn't flawless, though. At a point Logan refers to Charles as Charles, even though they're in the company of another family and Logan had given Charles the name of Chuck, but this could also just be a tiny mistake on Hugh Jackman, and I didn't mind that mistake. My problem is that the movie doesn't explain certain things very well, which left me guessing. Questions like 'Why is Wolverine getting poisoned by his own adamentium?' popped up in my head, but then again, this wasn't really a big flaw, I'd just like some more information on that subject. The villain was just OK, but the film didn't really need him to be better, because the main focus doesn't lay there. In the end 'Logan' was one of the better films I've seen that came out in 2017. It's a dark take on the character and it absolutely worked. The film was beautifully shot, with good and gruesome action scenes, that weren't there to be gruesome, but to show the dark and serious tone the film was going for. That's why this film gets a 8.9/10.",9,4,9,8 April 2017
La La Land," Amazingly directed and acted film, with a well written script and good songs
","'La La Land' is about two people, one an aspiring actor the other one a jazz enthusiast, who both fall for each other and whose story gets told via the manner of a musical.Damien Chazelle returns to create his second movie, also music-centered. His previous film, 'Whiplash', was one of the better films of 2014. In that movie he showed his talent, but in this one he even surpassed his previous achievements. Chazelle used incredibly long, beautiful shot takes, often accompanied with a good song, more on the songs later. These scenes are seamlessly cut together, whereby sometimes they make it seem that the scene was shot in one take, but actually had some cleverly hidden edits in them. Often these were hidden behind quick camera movements. The movie by the way begins in such a fashion, as I just described. That scene was done fantastic and set up high expectations for the rest of the film. What Damien Chazelle also did was to use vibrant colors throughout the whole film. Green, purple, yellow, red all return multiple times in the film, each end everyone having a meaning to them, which made the film more interesting.The songs were written with care and added to the film. They each told a story that had something to do with the scene or the story, and weren't just useless songs, there to fill up the moment, or to be there and later to sell a soundtrack to double their earnings. No, they are there, because they have a meaning. The songs were beautifully written and performed, and I really understand why the Oscars have picked out two of the songs, which I also found to be two of the best songs in the film. There were of course some songs that were lesser good, but even those I found to be amusing to listen to. Not only the songs sung by the cast were good, but also the instrumentals in the background were fantastic to listen to. Those also added to the scenes that they were setting up. I do have one problem with how some of the songs were presented, but that problem mostly lies with me, and not with the movie. This problem is that at times it feels kind of forced how they start some songs. At times they just burst out of songs, which was unfitting to me. But that's the nature of a musical, so what did I expect? But at times those scenes where handled very well. I liked how the lights drained out, only focusing on the one who's going to sing, and at times the singing also happened naturally and didn't feel forced, so it's kind of a double edged sword.I want to come back to the directing of Damien Chazelle, because I want to say a couple of things on his visual directing. That looked absolutely gorgeous. Like I've said, he used vibrant colors, which really made the scenes stand out more. The use of vibrant colors is also something that you don't see that often anymore in films, which is a shame, because look at the result 'La La land' got. The framing was good and the camera movements to were fantastic. Chazelle used shadow and lightning brilliantly to created good-looking shots, and he also masters the use of focus. Enough about that, let's move on to the acting. Ryan Gosling once again shows that he is a diverse actor and can play a whole host of characters. In this movie he gives a fantastic performance and it's no surprise that he has gotten that Oscar nomination. Emma Stone too gives a fantastic performance, at first I was a bit skeptical with her, but after the first thirty minutes or so, she persuaded me into enjoying her performance. The both of them had great on screen chemistry, whereby their relationship only became more believable and realistic. The script was very good and the characters stood out to me the most. The story itself was straightforward and easy to follow. Nonetheless it was a good story. It was realistic and grounded, just like the characters, and that's why I liked them so much. Most of the times you get to see unrealistic characters, but here that wasn't the case. In 'La La Land' you can see two relatable people, fighting to reach their dreams, accompanied with the struggle that fight brings them. Because these characters are so realistic and relatable, you also start to care for them. What I also liked about the film is that it made me appreciate jazz more, because of one particular scene, in which Ryan Gosling is enthusiastic about it trying to convince Emma Stone how good jazz can be. The scene was wonderfully written and in that scene he didn't only convince Emma Stone, but also me. The ending was weird at first, but when I realized what was going on, I started to appreciate it more and more, until the movie ended with it satisfying, yet heartbreaking conclusion. The film really plays with your emotions, and can make you feel sad and happy again in a spit second, but at the end it all felt like a feel-good movie created for people who have dreams and have trouble reaching them, what I very much appreciated.'La La Land' was a very good musical, and this comes from someone who generally doesn't like musicals. The songs were good and so was the acting. Damien Chazelle created one of the most well directed films of the year, and that's why I am giving this one a 9.2/10.",9,2,7,29 January 2017
Don't Breathe," A good premise, which was well executed
","Three teenagers break into the house of an old blind man, which they believe will be a simple task. Turns out it's not when the old blind man is played by Stephen LangThe director is the same one who tried to remake 'Evil Dead', which he did just OK-ly. In this film however Fede Alvarez, the director, did a fantastic job. He was the best part of the whole film. He used some very good camera movements and long takes, which created a slow feel at times, to create a tenser atmosphere. There's a very good scene when the three main protagonists first enter the house of the blind man. This was made to look like a long continuous take, in which the camera moves through the floor and through walls. In that sequence we also get to see some things that will be used further on in the film. They accentuate the things that later will be used pretty hard, but I didn't really mind because of the awesomeness of that scene alone. Fede Alvarez was really good at creating tension. He used slow editing, mixed with camera movements that went slow, or fast when needed. To build up tension, the editing was slow, and the camera movements to were slow. When there was a chase scene, it was the exact opposite. The amazing score accompanied with these scenes also helped with creating the tense atmosphere that they are going for. But the thing that might help the most is the basic premise of the film. The man having the disadvantage to the kids with being blind, and them breaking into his house, but more on that later. The cinematography was really good, this was one of the better looking horror films of recent years, some others conclude 'It Follows' and I found 'Green Room' to be shot very good as well. The acting was just OK overall. The main actress wasn't fantastic, but she did what she did what the film asked of her. Jane Levy played this character. The kid from 'Goosebumps', Dylan Minnette (Alex in the film) was pretty good. At least better than his co-star Jane Levy. The third and final kid of the three that break in was played by Daniel Zovatto, who basically copied Jared Leto's performance from 'Panic Room'. Not only did he copy his performance, but also his looks (the hair/clothing style). 'Don't breathe' copies that film in numerous aspects and it's quite obvious that it wants to pay homage to it, but at times they could've kept it more subtle. The scene which I previously talked about (the one continuous take), was also sort of copied from 'Panic Room'. The final actor I want to talk about is also basically the only actor who's there to talk about, who's also the star of the film, namely Stephen Lang, who played the blind man. He was fantastic. I loved his performance. He was menacing, yet made it in the beginning look like he was very innocent. The depth that he brought to his character was really good. And also note that he barely has any lines, so it was really amazing how he was able to express his emotions via little to no dialogue, which only makes the role harder.The screenplay was OK; the dialogue and premise were good, but the plot conveniences weren't really that good. These convenience or illogicalities really brought me out of the film at times. The inconsistency of the blind man's senses is an example of plot conveniences. He could smell shoes that were on the other side of the room, but wasn't able to smell someone, who's probably sweating due to stress, standing next to me. But also some things that happen mainly because of plot. Like the dog magically appearing in the house, yet all doors were locked. Or when Goosebumps kid falls through a window, yet they're all covered with bars The film contains a lot of these instances to which I disturbed myself, but these flaws aren't really groundbreaking. They are bad parts of the film and affect the grade that I'm giving this film, but overall worse things could've happened, and the good parts certainly outweigh the bad parts. Like the main premise for example. It was an original idea that hasn't really been done before, except for last year's 'Hush', but I that film the one whose house gets broken into was deaf and not blind. This sets up an interesting story, which was also executed pretty well. And what I also liked from the film is that it plays with who you are rooting for. At first I wasn't rooting for the three leads at all, because, well, they're breaking into the house of a defenseless, old, blind man. Even when we learn that the man isn't as defenseless as he seemed in the beginning, I still rooted for him, but then at around 75 percent into the film, something happens whereby the rooting side changed, and I really liked that.In the end 'Don't Breathe' was a well shot and directed film, with an interesting premise that was well executed. It does suffer a bit of plot conveniences, but these are outweighed by the better aspects of the film. That's why this one gets an 8.1/10.",8,2,6,28 March 2017
A Beautiful Mind," 'What truly is logic?'
","There are going to be some spoilers in here, but the movie is based on a true story so you can consider this as non spoilers. 'A beautiful mind' is about John Nash. A brilliant, but antisocial man. The movie starts of with him going to the university where he meets Charles, who becomes his best friend. At some point in the movie he gets offered a job, to work in cryptography. He accepts this job but it turns out to be a bad decision which changes his life...The movie is directed by Ron Howard, believe me or not, that is the same guy who did 'The Da Vinci Code'. I was very surprised too. It was very well directed in comparison to 'The Da Vinci Code'. I didn't like that movie at all, but I still gave it a 6/10 because I liked the book. The cinematography was also handled great. It was done by 'legend' Roger Deakins. This man is just amazing at his job every shot was really beautiful. The scene I personally thought was the best cinematographed was the scene where Charles and Nash were standing on the roof, how the camera flowed was just so pretty, the dialogue in this scene was also very good, this was my favorite scene. But not only in this scene is the movement of the camera good, this applies to almost all of the scenes. Which has a pretty outcome. What I didn't really like was how they used the orange collar scheme. it did make the movie look old, which I think they were aiming for, but I personally think it didn't look too good. The creativity put in to this movie was also very good. Like when Nash and Alicia are outside of a building and look up to the sky. Then Nash says that she must pick a shape and she tells him the shape of a umbrella, what I liked about this scene is how they lit up the stars that formed the umbrella. The also do this at times when Nash is cracking codes. It was overall cool to see how he unravels the codes. The make- up was very good, how they made Crowe look old was just so good.The acting of the movie was also amazing. Russel Crowe was by far the best. He played John Nash. He did an amazing job to portray him, and you could really believe that he was antisocial. You can see this in the beginning of the movie very well. Jennifer Connelly played Alicia. Alicia was the love interest of Nash. She was also good. She was a worried wife to him, and she nailed acting like one. Paul Bettany. His character I liked the most. He played Charles, a funny, caring, friend. And when he turned out to not be real I was shocked (a bit more about this twist further on in the review). Paul was also very good. Ed Harris played the 'Boss' off Nash when he started to work in cryptography. He was also good, but he was my least favorite character. There is also Adam Goldberg, he also played in the TV-show Fargo and in Saving Pravite Ryan. In this movie he did a good acting job, even though I think he was better in Fargo. You also have some smaller role characters, and they did the best they could. Overall the acting was good, but I was more blown away by Russel Crowes performanceThe script was good too. You can see this, by how easily you are convinced that Nash is antisocial. You can also feel the friendship that has bred between Nash and Charles, which makes it more heartbreaking to see him say goodbye to Charles. They also had some great chemistry. There were also some funny moments that broke the dramatic tone, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The twist in the middle of the movie was just mind blowing, I didn't see that coming, but I could have guessed. Because Charles was never at parties (in the beginning of the movie) but then he suddenly appeared out of nowhere. I definitely liked the twist, because it wasn't anything really predictable, like it is in most movies. But if you did some research you also could have known that it was all fake. Because of the writing and acting, you almost immediately cared about Nash, whereby it wad more sad to watch. Even though it is a drama it has some good romance in it to, what I didn't expect.Thank you for reading this review. I enjoyed watching this film, and would recommend this to other people. The ending is beautiful too. 'What truly is logic'",9,1,2,25 October 2015
Steve Jobs," Danny Boyles best movie that I've seen!
","'Steve Jobs' is about, obviously, Steve Jobs. In this movie we don't get to see his whole life, just three parts of it. But these three parts were career defining for him.The director of this movie is also known from other Oscar winning films e.g.: '127 Hours' and 'Slumdog Millionaire'. The director is of course Danny Boyle. I liked his previous films very much, '127 Hours' more than 'Slumdog Millionaire'. He is a very good director with his own special style, which he didn't really let shine in this movie. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because I think that this might have otherwise ruined the movie. Well Imight be exaggerating a bit, but it still wouldn't have the same quality as it has now. At some points his style can be seen, like when there is a conversation between two people and some of their text is shown projected. This was very nicely done, and made the movie stand up more, from a cinematographic standpoint. I don't know if Danny Boyle had any influence in what I'm going to say next, but I think he had. I very much liked the fact that they used different camera's in each time-period. This was something very subtle, and only really noticeable if you were paying attention. This just fitted in right with the theme of the movie and showed the progression of electronics, also something that the movie is based around. You might have enough about me talking about Danny Boyle so let's move on a bit. The cinematography was done well. The editing too, but the pacing was a bit to fast for my taste. The scenes were always on a rapid tempo, which I believe was done to show how tense it was behind the curtain, but making it some fast paced also made it difficult to follow sometimes. Even though this isn't a big issue, I still would like to mention it, because that is really my only complaint. At times the movie was cleverly edited, by showing bits of a dialogue in the past, and one from in the current present. This was complex, but gave a beautiful end result.The acting is the thing this movie got praised for. So was it that good? Yes. It was really good. Let's start of with the main actor, the one who played Steve Jobs, Micheal Fassbender. Fassbender is a very good actor and he shows it in this movie as well. He portrayed Steve Jobs really good, he didn't look anything like him, but he surely did a good job at portraying him. I don't think he deserved the Oscar-nomination for this movie. I think he deserved it for the movie 'Macbeth'. In that movie I found him to be way better than he was in this one. Kate Winslett is also in the movie, and she too did get nominated for an Oscar. Winslett played Joanna Hoffman. She was also very good, just sometimes I think her accent went away, but it was just barely noticeable. I think she did deserve the Oscar nomination, because I think that she was a tad better than Fassbender. The last actor I want to mention is Seth Rogen. Rogen played Wozniak, the person with whom Steve Jobs created Apple. Rogen normally plays in dumb comedies, but he has also played in some more serious movies like '50/50' for example. In that movie he proved that he can act in serious films, and in this one he does it again. In fact, I found him to be better in this movie than in '50/50'The writing of the movie was really the star. I can't understand why Aaron Sorkin, the scriptwriter, didn't win, or at least get nominated for best screenplay. It was so well written. How Sorkin portrayed Steve Jobs as an asshole reminded me of 'The Social Network', where he did the same with Mark Zuckerberk. But he just doesn't portray them as assholes, he does it with such care, that you somehow kind of feel for them. Such a brilliant Screenplay writer. His dialogue was very interesting, which was very important with a movie like this: it is a dialogue driven movie. There are no fight scenes, as you would expect. The story is about Steve Jobs life, but mainly focuses on his relationship with his daughter, or at least with the girls who is not sure of is his daughter or not. This was handled beautifully and showed the more human side of Steve Jobs. Maybe the best part of the movie was the ending. The part the whole movie was building up to. The last couple of scenes were so well crafted that the ending was so satisfying to watch. It showed the love that Steve Jobs had for his daughter, but also his future success.To wrap this review up I'll quickly summarize what I've mentioned in the review. The movie was well directed and acted, but Micheal Fassbender didn't really deserve the Oscar nomination, even though he did a good job. The screenplay was written wonderfully, and this is the thing that díd deserve an Oscar. 'Steve Jobs' is my favorite Danny Boyle film and that's why I'm giving it an 9.4/10.",9,0,1,13 August 2016
There Will Be Blood," Eye-candy, but with substance!
","'There will be blood' is about Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is someone in the oil industry. In this movie we follow him as he is growing his oil-empire.The movie is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who has previously directed 'The Master', a movie that I really wanted to see, and after this movie even more. If it wasn't clear yet, Paul Thomas Anderson did an amazing job at directing 'There will be blood', he also wrote the screenplay for the movie, but more on that later. Anderson is not only a good director, but also a good visionary director. This went hand in hand with the cinematography, which created stunning shots, that showcased the gorgeous scenery. It was no surprise to me that the movie won an Oscar for the cinematography. The cinematography was done by Robert Elswit, just to give him some credit. The director is really good at showing set pieces in a cinematic way, for example the fire putting out scene. This was one fantastic scene, with beautiful cinematography and set design. But to only make this scene better, the soundtrack kicks in. The soundtrack was really extraordinary. It was original - not reused - and fitted the movie well. In the first place the soundtrack didn't really feel right for me, but after seeing the fire putting out scene, I was convinced that the soundtrack really fitted the movie well. I previously talked about the directing in wide, open spaces and sets, but the movie begins with a small set. A small thing I want to mention is that a big part of the first act is completely silent. This is a ballsy thing to do, but just by visual story-telling my attention was kept. Really impressive. Let's go back to the small set. In that set Anderson really makes you feel claustrophobic, and sucks you into the movie almost immediately. Weird that the director didn't get the Oscar, but I don't know the competition, so I can't really say.The acting is by far one of the better trades this movie has to offer. This can also be seen by the Oscar that 'There will be blood' has won. In case you're to lazy to check, I'll say it here. Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar for his role as Daniel Plainview. And, was it deserved? Yes, yes indeed. Daniel Day-Lewis is an amazing actor and proved that in 'Lincoln' again. Also the fact that he has won three academy awards is a good argument to prove that he is a very good actor. In this movie he absolutely nailed the role of Daniel Plainview. He is convincing as the character and was able to show his emotions very well. Even in the end, when he has kind of lost his sanity, he still preforms very well. The other actor who had quite a big role was Paul Dano's character. Him I didn't like as much as Daniel Day-Lewis, but that's just maybe because Day-Lewis overshadowed him. I also found that Paul Dano over-acted a tiny bit, but this is not really a bad thing, as shown in the preaching scenes. More on these later. The last person I want to mention here is the actor of HW. He was not to great. I didn't really felt the 'power' of his performance, and I will definitely not remember something of his performance.The screenplay was, as said previously, written by the director himself. And was this part of the movie good? Well, you guessed it: yes. The Anderson has written fantastic monologues that were said brilliantly by the characters. which brings me to the characters. They were all interesting and multi-layered. Especially the character of Daniel Plainview. Plainview undergoes a lot of character progression and also has a character arc. His character has so much layers, that it is incredible that Daniel Day-Lewis was able to pull this role of, which is the more impressing. Plainview was also unpredictable, which made his character more engaging. Another thing I want to mention is how different the Plainview is from Eli. Eli is religious and Plainview is an atheist for one example. This only made the scene with the both of them interesting to watch, because you wanted to know how the scene would end, due to the unpredictability of Plainview. The story overall was solid and fun to watch. The ending, however, I found a bit odd, and not fitting. I liked that Plainview has lost his sanity, but where he kills Eli was just odd to me. I get his motivation, but it wasn't satisfying enough for me.In the end 'There Will Be Blood' was an excellent film. The movie was visually stunning, but it was more than eye-candy: It had substance. The story and characters were solid and the acting only helped to improve on this.9.25/10",9,1,3,16 August 2016
Whiplash," Not a 'Good Job' :)
","I'll explain my title further on, this is also going to be a shorter review, because it has been a couple of days since I saw the movie.Whiplash is about Andrew Neiman. He is very driven to become the best jazz drummer in the world, but not just in the world, he wants to be remembered for his drumming. He starts his first year in the best jazz school in America. In the class he is in he gets discovered by Fletcher. Fletcher asks him if he wants to join the jazz band of his. In this band Andrew is capable of entering competitions. Fletcher is willen to push every member of his band to become better, but maybe he is pushing them to hard.'Whiplash' is directed by Damien Chazelle. He did a nice job at directing the movie. The cinematography was also handled nicely, there were some nice shots. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the color pallet. It fitted the theme of the movie, but because there was a lot of black in it, you couldn't always see what was going on. The editing was flawless. Especially in the last fifteen to twenty minutes when he is drumming. What brings me to the next subject. The music. The music is so, so good. I loved the music, and normally I am not a fan of Jazz music. It was nice to look at how Miles Teller played on his drums. The realistic theme of the movie was also something I liked. The blood on the drum sticks, the sweat on the drum itself, and on Miles Teller. The movie was surprisingly tense full as well. You didn't want Andrew to fail. The acting was superb. Miles Teller was perfectly cast as Andrew. Andrew is the main character of the movie. You cared about him. He is driven to his absolute breaking point, to then rise and become better then before. But now why Miles Teller was the best casting choice. Teller started playing on the drums since the age of fifteen. Which gives the drumming a more realistic feel. I've also read somewhere that the blood on his drum stick, his own blood was. I love when an actor dedicates himself that much to a role. He was very good as Andrew. J.K. Simmons played Tarrence Fletcher. He trains Andrew (Teller) in a very violent way, e.g by throwing chairs at his head. He was absolutely amazing. This is his best performance yet. He was so good and so intimidating as Fletcher. He really deserved his Oscar, and it is such a shame that they gave him such a small role in 'Terminator: Genisys'. They could have made this movie a lot better than it is now. Melissa Benoist plays Nicole. She is the love interest for Andrew. She was willing to support him in his decisions, but Andres thinks it is better that they break up, so he can focus more on the drums. She was also very good, better than in the new cbs show 'Supergirl'. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well. The writing was brilliant. How they wrote the characters was very good. The curse words Fletcher used were creative, but what I think was very powerful, was when the car of Andrew got hit, by a truck. This was powerful, because it showed how afraid Andrew was to lose his part, that he even ran after a accident and just drummed on a stage. This was definitely something that defined his character. With Fletcher there is also a character defining moment. When he tells to his band that an old student of his is pasted away. He tells his band that the person died due to a car crash, but later we find out that the person committed suicide. The characters were all fleshed out very well.Now I'll explain my title. At a certain point in the movie Andrew and Fletcher are talking to each other. Fletcher says to Andrew: 'In the English language there is nothing more harmful than 'good job!'. So the title is actually a joke.The movie was an amazing time, it is for sure a got to movie for music lovers, or just for people who like a good movie.",9,1,2,22 November 2015
Kong: Skull Island," 'Kong: Skull Island' contains enjoyable action scenes, but is lacking in characters
","A team has discovered an unknown island and was sent to that place to research it. But at arrival they entered the domain of Kong Jordan Vogt-Roberts was the director of this film and he also wasn't really the problem of the film. Visually this film looks good, but that's also the best the film has to offer. The color grading was good enough and gave it a more vintage look and the cinematography overall was pretty good. The director had somewhat sense of scale, because he liked to put a human, as tiny as possible into the frame with Kong, who is ginormous in comparison to said human portrayed on screen. But that immediately brings me to one of the problems of the film: Kong. Well, how he looked at least, because even though he didn't visually look good, the scenes with him in them were the best that you can find in the film. Kong just looked very CGI to me, and he was the best looking CGI creature in the movie. This film is filled with moments in which the CGI is overwhelming. If they'd used more props, or went to location a bit more, this would've changed the movie quite a bit. Especially in the night scenes you could see that they were filmed in a set and that the backdrop consisted out of a green screen. And sometimes the film also goes into the ridiculous department with the CGI by showing the northern lights. Yes, the northern lights, you read that right. I know that they went on location numerous times, but some scenes then were shot in complete green rooms. Another aspect the movie failed at was the tone. It tried to be a drama, and action film, an over the top action film, a comedy, a serious film and all these things did not fit together at all. Often enough it tried to be taken seriously, when just unintentional funny stuff was going on, or it tried to be funny, when there was just nothing to laugh at.The actors were just doing what the script was offering them, which is not a lot. The cast of this film is phenomenal, but underused. They have Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Toby Kebbell, Samuel Jackson, John C. Reilly, John Goodman The list goes on and on. All actors gave good performances, and were only likable due to their natural charisma. Samuel Jackson and John C. Reilly only managed to make their jokes work because of their on screen charisma. But some actors also had no chemistry together on screen and those were the little group of soldiers who were under Samuel Jackson's command. None of them felt like they liked each other and their relationship felt forced from the beginning.The screenplay was the main problem with this film, because dear god, what did they do with the characters? Well, the characters that don't exist, because I've just watched two hours of hollow, empty, characterless human beings interact with each other, interchanged with some awesome scenes of Kong. But they had set up some things to create some interesting character, yet they completely forget about those things. In the beginning of the film for example we see Samuel Jackson's character with a bottle of alcohol, and he seems to be distant in the conversation he's having, which in my opinion insinuates the fact that he might be an alcoholic after the Vietnam War, but they never do anything with that set up character trait throughout the whole movie. The character of Toby Kebbell was given some character by having him write to his son, which practically made him together with John C. Reilly the most developed characters of them all, and the film has quite a lot of characters. John C. Reilly was stranded on the island for a very long time and we get to hear a bit about his past, but most of the time we get to re-hear what he has said before, so that really didn't add a lot to his character. Tom Hiddelston's character is just there to be cool, he's a tracker and that's pretty much all to his character. There's one scene where he talks about his past with Brie Larson, but that scene added very little to me caring for that character. There's also this ridiculous scene involving him in which he just asks for a sword and starts chopping things up, while magically having put on a gasmask with one hand, just to create one badass, senseless looking shot, which wasn't worth it at all. And if you want to know something more about Brie Larson's character: she's a photographer. The dialogue overall was just fine, there were some cheesy one liners, and bad jokes, but as a whole, it didn't achieve much.In the end 'Kong: Skull Island' wasn't a good movie at all, it was quite disappointing even. The acting was good and the action scenes were enjoyable, but the characters were lacking and the CGI wasn't the greatest. That's why this film gets just a 5.6/10.",6,0,1,9 April 2017
Arrival," One of Villeneuve's best films!
","'Arrival' is based on the short story written by Ted Chiang, which is about a linguistic called Louise bank, who's hired by the army to communicate with aliens, that have landed on earth in these so called cocons.The movie was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, because of one reason: Denis Villeneuve. I've seen nearly every movie of him, and the ones I haven't seen, I'll probably see in the near future. He is an amazing director, who pays attention to everything he brings into frame, and everything he brings into frame has some kind of meaning. In this movie that's also the case. Not as much as in 'Enemy' for example, but it's there. At a certain point I thought the movie was going to be like 'Enemy', because of one scene, but after all this movie wasn't as complicated. More on that later in my second to last paragraph (There'll be spoilers). He also, just like in the rest of his movies (e.g. Sicario, Prisoners), succeeds at building up tension. The scenes where Louise is trying to communicate with the aliens were always kind of tenseful, because you don't know how they're going to react. The cinematography I found to be gorgeous. The scenery, use of focus and lighting were all perfect. The use of focus was something that really caught my eye. It gave scenes a more dreamlike feel, when it had to, which kind of helped me to unravel the twist at the end. At those scenes focus was overused, but it worked. Those scenes also contained more close-ups to show the emotion of the actors, which made everything more effective. The use of colour was also handled well, which only made the gorgeous looking shots, look even more gorgeous. I found it to be a shame that Roger Deakins wasn't the cameraman for this film, but Bradford Young surprised me by doing something nearly as good. Young really captured the reveal scene of the spaceship very well. I think that that was one of my favorite scenes. The soundtrack in the background, the mist waving over the mountains, the camera movement. Everything was there to make the scene fantastic, and it was. The soundtrack was original and fitted the movie well. The CGI I found to be good at times but during one scene it didn't really live up to what the movie had showed previously. The ship and aliens themselves looked good, but there's one scene, I can't talk about due to spoilers, which didn't look good. The acting was absolutely fantastic. Amy Adams gives again a wonderful performance. She gives depth to her character and you could really see the emotion on her face. You could see what she was feeling, due to the visual story telling of Villeneuve. There were a lot of scenes, where she just had to act, without saying a single word and we knew what was going on inside her head, because of Amy Adams wonderful acting. I really hope she gets an Oscar-nod for this performance, because it really blew me away. Her character was very interesting, but more on that in the next paragraph. Jeremy Renner also gave a fantastic performance. His performance was less spectacular than the one of Amy Adams. SPOILERS FROM HERE.The screenplay should also deserve an Oscar-nod for best adapted screenplay. The story was told in a weird – but good - way, whereby you get to care for the character of Louise. This was done by showing her memories of the future, mixed in with the stuff that's going on right now. This was such a creative way to build up a character that I was amazed by it. In those memories they used the focus heavily, like I've said before. The character of Louise really got fleshed out very well. The rest of the characters didn't really get the same treatment, but that's something very normal and something you shouldn't complain about, because Louise is after all the main character. I've also hear people say that Jeremy Renner's character is useless, and with that too I'll have to disagree. He indirectly helped with the character building of Louise and did also do some things himself to progress the story, so I don't see why he would be useless. Now something about the twist. Louise can see in the future. I found the twist to be kind of unexpected. I was kind of expecting some kind of answer in that direction, but not the answer we got. It was creative and something new. Due to a particular scene I was expecting something more complicated, because the twist gets explained fairly well. This scene was also the one that reminded me of 'Enemy' and this was the one where Louise sees the alien in the corner. It reminded me of the giant spider in 'Enemy', and because of that I was expecting a movie that you really have to think about to get. That's not entirely the case with this movie. It does make you think, but not in the way that 'Enemy' does. This one makes you think about humankind and how we react in situations like these. We would just attack them, and that our society just doesn't accept different. It also makes you think about the concept of time and time loops. I loved the fact that the movie makes you think about these things, because that's when you know you've seen a good movie: when it makes you think about it, and not necessarily the things they show in the movie, but the questions it brings up. The dialogue is also very good, but at the end there's just one line that felt out of place. But that's really the only critique I have on that.That's all I can say due to the word limit. In the end this was one of Villeneuve's best movies. 10/10",10,3,10,21 December 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman
","Birdman is about Riggan (Michael Keaton). Riggan once was a successful actor of a popular superhero. The hero was ,ofcourse, Birdman. but times flew by and he has become less popular. Now he tries to redeem himself by writing a new play whole by himself. He will also direct and ply in it. The movie follows Riggan how he handles his new play, how critics react to it, how he reacts to critics, about his own family live... An example of the critics: in the movie at a certain point, Riggan is sitting in a bar and meets this girl. The girl turns out to be a film critic. And before even watching his play, she says to him that she will write a bad review about his play. The movie is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu. Before I watched this movie this director was an unknown man (for me at least). But he did an amazing job at directing, I really liked the style. But it must have been very trying for the actors in it. I have read in the 'trivia' that they had to learn more than 10 pages of script. But as I have said, I loved the directingNow the actors and the script. Micheal Keaton is good in the movie. He did a good job and I have nothing to say bad about his preformans. But the actress that had the best lines and did the best acting job was, in my opinion Emma stone. I loved her in the movie. when she was saying to her dad (Micheal Keaton) that he isn't the only one fighting to be relevant. I absolutely loved that scene, it was my favorite scene of the entire movie. Edward Norton did also a really good job. I didn't like the personality of his character as much. It's like Joffrey Baratheon from game of thrones. Everyone hates him, but he makes the people hate him (if you know what I mean. The script of the movie is very well written, and as I have said, that the 'relavant' scene is my favorite scene, but there are a lot of other scenes that are equally as good. Overall I thought that Emma stone got the best lines form the hole movie.The movie is also pretty funny at times, but also dramatic during the end of the movie. A funny part is when Riggan walks through times square in his underwear. or when he jumps of the roof an thinks he is flying, but actually took a taxi. And than the most dramatic scene, when he tries to commit suicide in front of a live audience, an in the hospital, when he jumps out of the window.I Really liked the movie and here are some individual scores:Directing: 10/10Acting: 9/10writing: 10/10thats a total of 29/30 which is rounded 10",10,0,2,12 June 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Much better than I thought it would be, but still not fantastic
","While reading this review, keep in mind that I have seen this movie, and that I will discuss some spoilers. In this comic book adaptation, we see, like the title suggests, Batman and Superman fighting... for like five minutes. Seriously. They fight for five minutes. But everything builds up to this, but they don't only build up to the fight. No, also other things, which brings me to my first problem with the movie. But as always I will discuss this in my last paragraph.Let's start of with the directing. You could have easily guessed that this movie is directed by Zack Snyder; Slow Motion? Check. Muscular men? Check. References to previously made movies by him? Check... I could go on, but I only have my 1000-words limit, and it would be not entertaining to read, if anyone actually reads these reviews, except from me. I was a little suspicious when they said that Zack Snyder would be directing the movie, and I guess I was right. I never really enjoyed watching Zacks movies, so I was also going to expect a not so fun movie. The movie was fun, though, but not to great. Snyder did create a very beautiful movie. I didn't really have a comment on his camera choices. But again, a trademark for Snyder, is the dark filter put over the movie. There are movies that come of great with it (Gone Girl, Fury...) But in this movie it looked like everything was night all the time. Or just really clouded. Snyders directing isn't the knockdown argument. He actually did a fine job, so congrats Snyder. The bad part lays in the script/screenplay. This, again will be discussed in the end of my review. The cinematography was as well very pretty to look at. This was done by Larry Fong. I didn't hate the movie, so there are also some things, except from the acting directing and writing, that I will discuss in the paragraph. The first thing is the violence, which also brings a negative, but let's first start of with the positive. The fight- scenes were choreographed well, and so was the directing at those times. No real shaky cam, and no obnoxious editing, in my opinion. But the negative aspect is the choice they made for the Batman character. He kills people. This was really annoying for me, as a fan. You can't say that I don't know with certainly that he kills them, because I am pretty sure that people die from explosions, and by getting shot at... Well at least last time I checked. The CGI was a bit less good. It was like in the trailers. The only good Cgi thing was Superman flying, etc. The cape of Batman was also made of Cgi, and you could easily see that. The editing overall was kind of good, nothing really fantastic. The 3D doesn't add anything to the movie, except for the five extra euros.Now the acting and characters. Batman was played by Ben Affleck. I really liked his version of the character, except for the killing part. His Bruce was damaged and you could see that, due to the acting. He has a lot of stares, but you can see the emotion in them. I also understand his idea why Superman has to be stopped, on the contrary of a other characters motivation. Superman was played by Henry Cavill. He was good, but not as good as Affleck. Cavills Superman isn't my favorite, he does do his best, but it's just not enough for me. He played with not so much emotion, when I think that he should have showed emotion. The antagonist, well the main antagonist, was Lex Luthor. I really didn't like his character in the movie. He had no motivation for wanting Batman dead, or they just don't tell it in the movie. Luthor was played by Jesse Eisenderg. He is a good actor, but he overacted a lot of the scenes. A helper of Superman is the well know Lois Lane. She is a character that I very much like, she is independent, yet she brags with it. Amy Adams did a fantastic job at portraying her. Wonder Woman also has a role in the movie, just a small one. She is there to just be there. But I liked the incarnation of her. Gal Gadot was good, for the scenes that she was in. Jermey Irons as Alfred was the most surprising for me. I absolutely loved him. The chemistry between Affleck and him was great, and they builded on it. The supporting cast was fine, some better than others.The screenplay was the worst part of the movie. The dialogue between characters was a bit dull at times, but that is not the worst part. What I wonder is why no one has decided to tell them that a lot of the lines felt forced. Like the 'Do You Bleed' scene. It is a cool line etc. But someone probably came up with it, and suggested it. The others probably went like: 'Yeah, sure, we'll get in in there...' there are a lot of forced, cool lines, that feel out of place. But also just moments without dialogue are sometimes dull. But the story overall is, like I predicted, a total mess. If you would ask me to sum up the plot in a understandable way, I would have to think a long time... Also they tried to put in as many characters in the movie, which didn't work out well. There is also to much set up, if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean. (the e-mails). They really want to get you excited for the next movie, but this just didn't make me want to see it, eventhouh I probably will.That's all I can say, due to the limit. But thank you for reading this review.6.75/10",7,0,2,24 March 2016
Before Sunrise," A good love story
","In this first part of the 'Before' trilogy, we meet Jesse and Celine. They are both on the train, and both witness a German couple fighting. They decide to go to the lounge area, where they get to know each other better, and after a while, they get out of the train to go explore the city together.Before I start to review this movie let me say that I had very low expectation, but I got proved wrong. This movie is directed by the director who is called Richard Linklater. He has 'recently' directed the very good movie 'Boyhood', which took 12 years to shoot.That movie was well directed, and so was this one. Linklater did a good job, again. The cinematography was good too, nothing very special or that stood out to me. The best part of the movie is the screenplay, but I am going to talk about that part in a bit. The set pieces were good too, even though there are all real. But that is all I have to say about the movie in this part of my review.Now lets movie on to the characters, and the actors of them. Here they did something special in my opinion. They only had two cast members. The other people you see in the movie just have a minor role, and are just extras. So this movie just focuses on two characters. A male and a female. Jesse and Celine. The first one I am going to talk about is Jesse. He was played by Ethan Hawke. Hawke has recently took on some very bad roles. *cough* Getaway *cough* but also some good ones like 'Boyhood'. He plays two totally different characters in both movies, but in both movies he is really good. In 'Before Sunrise' I think that he portrayed the character of Jesse very good. The Jesse character was good too, but more on that in the paragraph of the screenplay. Now the female part was played by Julie Delpy. She played the love interest of Jesse, who is called as you could have probably guessed Celine. I hadn't seen any work of her before I watched this movie, and I think that that is going to change soon. She was very good. The accent made her sound cute, no that is a joke, for everyone who has seen the movie. But to get serious again, the accent gave something more to the character of Celine. This gave away that she was french etc. The chemistry between these characters is also something that drove this movie further. They had very good on screen chemistry. A scene where you can see this very good is the so called 'record-shop' scene. Here they get in this listening cabin, and there is no dialogue, for quiet a long time, but you do not bother, that there is none. Not because the dialogue is so bad in every scene that you get a little brake from it, no, the dialogue is very good actually. It's the acting, and emotion on their faces that move this scene. The extras were very good. The one that stayed with me the most was the one with the street poet. I particularly liked this scene because it showed a bit of Hawkes character, but also because it is a beautiful scene overall.The screenplay. This was like I have said earlier the best thing of the movie, and I wasn't kidding. It is a dialogue driven movie, and also a dialogue heavy movie. That's one of the things I was afraid of the they would screw up. But they didn't. Luckily. You often have these long conversations between the two characters, but you don't get bored of them. You get invested in them. There is this scene that I want to bring up. In this scene Jesse and Celine are sitting in some kind of bus, and they are asking each other questions to get to know each other. This scene is in particular good, because of the character development, but you also just get sucked into their conversations. Due to all of these dialogue scenes, you start to care for these characters, something that you don't see that often anymore in movies. 'Good Will Hunting' (my favorite movie of all time) did this as well. But now the characters. these were, like I have said, very good. You get to know Jesse in small bits, first on the train, about his TV- sow idea, then on the bus about his shyness of his first love, and then you see that he really opens up for this girl, and he tells her about how his dad hated him. In combination of all of these aspects that I have just numbered, you really start to care for him. I cared less for Celine, but she was still a very good character. The conversations between Celine and Jesse also feel very real. So felt the actions they did. They looked like a normal couple.But overall I thought that this was a very good love story, between two very good characters.",8,0,0,6 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A lot better than the prequels
","Before you start to read this review, realize, that I have in fact seen the movie, and that I am going to talk about the spoilers: You have been warned! 'The force Awakens' starts of 30 after the sixth movie. Luke has disappeared, after one of his Jedi-students turned on him. Luke saw this as his responsibility, so he ran. Now Lea is destined to find him and she has sent her best X-wing pilot to find a map, that leads to Lukes location. This isn't as easy as it sounds...The movie is directed by J.J. Abrams, and boy, am I glad that they chose him to direct. He has rebooted the Star Trek series, and I liked those movies, so I had good hopes for this one. The movie felt like a Abrams movie. The, yes they were there, lens flares, but also the colors used. in the desert planet called Jakku, the more reddish tones were accentuated, but on the more natural planet, it was more the blue color, which was accentuated. The cinematography of this movie was just so beautiful. There are some pretty aerial shots, which brings out the feel of the surroundings of the characters. The sound was good as well. It was very fun to listen to. The fighting scenes were nicely choreographed, better as in the prequels, but also as in the original trilogy. And the space battles, oh, the space battles. They were very cool to look at they gave me goosebumps. When Poe came to save Finn, Han and Chewie, ah, that was such a nice scene. But what I maybe liked the most about this movie, are the practical effects. Of course they use Cgi, how else would you make a Scifi movie? But when there were aliens or explosions, they used practical effects. The sets are also real, which is good. The set design I liked too. The special effects (when they were there) were cool, but you could often spot the deferents between them and the practical effects.The acting was fantastic. Harrison Ford came back as Han Solo, so did Carrie Fisher, she reprises her role as Lea and Mark Hamill was Luke Skywalker again. But before I talk about them, I would like to start of with my favorite character of this movie. And this is Poe. He is played by Oscar Isaac. Poe is the best pilot in the entire universe and is put onto the mission to search for the map that leads to Luke. But he was just so cool, I can't even express myself. He is not arrogant, but he knows his skills and is very nice too. I knew Oscar Isaac could act after seeing 'Ex Machina', and he was also good in this role. The next character I am going to talk about is Finn. Finn is played by John Boyega. Finn is a total different character than Poe, but they still become friends, and I loved the chemistry between them. Boyega was very good, he was happy to be in Star Wars, and that translates to the screen (wich is good) Finn was a Storm Trooper, but one day he decided that he should do something for the good, because he thinks it doesn't feel right what he is doing right now, so he saves Poe. Whereafter he meets Rey. Rey is a scavenger played by Daisy Ridly. You could see that the writers put the most attention in her character, to give her a background story. I didn't like her character the much, but that doesn't change that she acted very well. She was very good together with Harrison Ford, it actually felt like a real good Father- Daughter relation ship, just as they say in the movie, that Han is like the father she never had. And now for a sec I am not going to talk about humans but about BB- 8. It was the round droid, that belonged to Poe. BB-8 was funny, and cute, and an extra plus to the movie overall. Carrie Fisher was good as Lea, you could really see that she didn't know how to feel about Han, but still loved him. Harrison Ford, I knew that he didn't really want to do sequels for this movie, so it wasn't a big surprise that he died. I was still shocked by who he died, by his own son. Played by Adam Driver. Yep, Kylo Ren was Hans son. Kylo Ren was an intimidating villain, but when he took of his mask, you could see the venerability of him, and that he still is a human. He was good too. If you are going to see this movie to see Andy Serkis, don't go. He only has like 5 minutes of screen time. I think that he is going to be back in the next movie, tho. Due to his short screen time, I can't really say anything about him. You only see Luke at the end of the movie, but he looks very cool as a Jedi. The script was well written, the only issue I have with it is that there are a lot of jokes in it. It wasn't a big problem for me. The jokes were funny, the worked well, and suited the story, but a bunch of jokes can get annoying after a while for some people (not for me). But the best part of the script was the beginning credits (the yellow letters in the beginning) gave me goosebumps and made me excited to watch the movie. The yellow letters were useful to know what was going on. There was also put a lot into the characters, like I said before. But the ending of the movie is not too great, a lot of people will be mad at the ending, but I am OK with it.I loved this movie, and would recommend watching it!",9,21,55,16 December 2015
50_50," A comedy, that isn't really a comedy
","50/50 is about Adam. Adam is a normal guy who doesn't drink, nor smokes, but when he gets diagnosed with cancer his life turns upside down. In this movie we see how he handles this situation.I want to start this review of by saying that the directing of the movie was very good. This was his third time directing a feature film. And this was also his best feature film. It was well directed, and done by Jonathan Levine, a man who I had never heard before, but now I want to watch other movies that are directed by him. The cinematography of 50/50 was pretty to. There wasn't a single shot that I thought could have been done better. This was done by Terry Stacey. 50/50 is by far his best movie. If you want to compare, he is also known for the cinematography 'Dear John', and 'PS I love you'. So you will see why I say this. But that is all I really have to say about this part in my review, the best parts mostly lay in the acting, and writing, so let's go over to that bit.First, the acting. This was very good. The characters felt real, and acted like real people. The main character of 50/50 is Adam, the one who get's cancer. He has a 50 percent chance of surviving with his type of cancer, thats why the movie is called that way. Adam was played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I have disliked him for quiet a bit, but since I have seen more of his movies (Inception, Looper, The Dark Knight Rises, etc.) I have started to like him more, and started seeing him as a good actor. And in this movie he has proved that thing again. He was very convincing, and looked like a real person. His love interest, and girlfriend is Rachael. She was played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She was good too. But the one that surprised me the most is Seth Rogen. I think that he is most of the time annoying in a movie. But he surprised me very much, because I liked him in 50/50. His character was also funny. How he reacts in the art gallery really fits his character, and if you have seen the movie, you will know what I mean. What also proves the great acting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen, is when Adam shaves of his hair. This was all improvised, and I didn't know that until I read the trivia on IMDb. They stayed in character very well. But let's move on to the next character/actress. She was my favorite one, because I could relate to her character. This was Katherine, played by Anna Kendrick. Katherine is a very messy person, not only physically, but also kind of mentally. She is not to good with other people, but it suits her, and makes her character someone cute. Kendrick did a amazing job at portraying this character. But these are the actors that I wanted to discus. Now I will move on to the script and writing.In this paragraph I want to start of with this thing: The script was amazing. 50/50 is not your ordinary comedy. It makes you laugh at times, but also cry. I wouldn't actually call this a comedy. Yes, It has funny bits in it, and yes, the contrast between Adam and Kyle (Seth Rogen) was funny, but there were more sad scenes than funny ones. The scene in which Adam starts to drive in Kyles car, and stops, where after he starts crying and screaming, isn't funny at all. This was very good character development, though, but still. There are more moments like these in the movie than moments where they burn down a painting, or the scene from Kyle in the art gallery. Like I have said in my third paragraph, the characters are great. They feel like real people, people you could meet on the street. What I also liked is the chemistry between Adam and Kyle, but also Adam and Katherine. In the movie you can see the relationship develop. From Adam being annoyed by Katherine, to loving her. And the chemistry between Adam and Kyle was good too. As I have said, this is a funny bit, but also shows the friendship between them. The dialogue is good too, nothing really outstanding, but it was good.That is all I have to say about 50/50. I think that this movie is very good, and that it is impressive that they have made a good comedy- drama from a dark subject.",9,0,0,20 March 2016
Deadpool," A very good comic book movie
","The basic plot of 'Deadpool' is: A boy's girlfriend gets kidnapped by the bad guy and now he has to save her. But there is another part. The revenge part. Deadpool is driven to take down the man who has made him who he is right now.The directing was done by Tim Miller. This was his first movie, he directed. Miller did a very good job at directing 'deadpool'. Especcialy because it is his first movie. The cinematography was pretty enough. It wasn't really mindblowingly good, but still, it was nice to look at. The pacing of this movie was really extraordinary. It was really fast paced, and that fitted the theme of the movie very well. To come back on the directing again. There were no shaky cams! I absolutely loved that they didn't use that. These things can ruin a movie. The fight scenes were also well edited, you could follow everything well. The costume design was also pretty good. I thought that the Deadpool costume looked true to the comics. And the rest was good as well. The set design was good too. Now, the CGI. This is the part were you can see that they didn't really have a big budget. The eyes of Deadpool were CG, and you could tell. Also Collosus, looked a bit too CG, for me at least. And now one of the best parts of the movie, not regarding the acting and script, the soundtrack! This was really good. It's not music I will start listening to, but it fitted the movie well. Very well, actually. The violence was very good too, as I have said, now shaky cam, etc. But it was very good choreographed too. I am glad this movie got a R-rating. The blood and gore were very good in the movie.The acting was very good, but let's start of with the best casted person of the entire movie. You guessed it. Ryan Reynolds. This man was born to play Deadpool/Wade Wilson. He absolutely blew it out of the park. You can't always see his face, because of the mask, but the voice acting and body acting was great on it's own. He was like Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine. Absolutely fantastic, straight out of the comic book series. His character also had a lot of development. Then the next person is the best friend of Wade Wilso. This was a man called Weasel. Weasel was played by T.J. Miller. What I liked very much between those two, was the friendship. It was very convincing. T.J. Miller did a good job portraying this character. Now, another person who had great on screen chemistry with Ryan Reynolds, was Morena Baccarin. Morena Baccarin played Vanessa. Vanessa was a prostitute, before she met Wade. But when they find each other in a mercenary bar, they fall in love. She is the one that gets kidnapped. I liked her character. Now a man who is less liked by Deadpool, Ajax, or as Deadpool likes to call him: Francis. Ajax/Francis was played by Ed Skrein. I am happy for him that he had this movie in development after the disaster of 'Transporter Refuled'. Because he was very good in this movie. The only really problem I have with this villain is that he didn't really have a motive to hate Deadpool/Wade. I know Wade was pretty annoying against him, but isn't it a bit overreacting to kidnap his girlfriend? You can also say that he is just crazy, and I can't disagree with that point. But overall Ajax was well acted. The next two person I am going to discus, helped Deadpool getting Vanessa back. These two are Collosus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Collosus was voiced by Stefan Kapicic. He was good. The Russian accent made his character more funny in his own way. Negasonic Teenage Warhead was played by Brianna Hildebrand. She was very good. She was a typical teenager, with some awesome superpowers. The next two person, was just funny to have in the story. The first one was Blind Al, the person who lives together with Deadpool. She was funny, and well acted, and now the last person I am going to discus was played by Karan Soni. He was the taxi driver. He was funny as well, and acted good too. I left out the actress of angel dust, on purpose, because I don't really have anything to say about her.The script. This was a very good part of the movie. It was very funny. The jokes all worked, even the hidden ones. And with 'Hidden ones' I mean movie references, and comic book. The dialogue was very good as well. They managed to slide from a very funny tone, to a more serious tone, very well. I am glad that Ryan Reynolds got the chance to change stuff in the script, I think that that made the script a lot more funny. Another thing that was pretty good, which you can see as a part of the script, was the opening credit scene. This was very hilarious. Als the image you get at the end, was funny. A cool part of the script is the story telling. We first see a Deadpool in a cab, willing to find Ajax, but than at the end of the fight scene, we go to a origin story. I think that this was very original and well handled. The fourth wall breaking is a bit unusual at first, but you will start to get used to it. The jokes, are as I've said, very funny, but I think that there might be a bit too much jokes in it. There are also a lot of clichés, in the movie, but due to the good acting, directing, and funny jokes, I could see past that.Overall Deadpool is a funny movie. It is also a great directorial debut. I would definitely recommend watching the movie!",8,4,13,12 February 2016
Inside Llewyn Davis," Au Revoir
","Last night I saw this very good movie about a man who is struggling to find his place in the music industry if 1960. We get to see one week of his life. This movie was called : 'Inside Llewyn Davis'The movie is directed by the masterful duo of Joel and Ethan Coen. These are not my favorite directing and screen writing duo, thought. That would be the Nolan brothers. Johnathan and Christopher. I haven't seen a lot of the Coens movies; I only saw 'No Country for Old Man', a movie that was a bit dragging, but tense at the right moments, and 'The Big Lebowski', a movie where the story didn't make a lot of sense, but where the jokes were on point. So after seeing those movies, I was expecting something similar. Maybe a bit boring or so? But I was completely wrong. This movie isn't boring at all! The Coens did an amazing job at directing the movie. They used a lot of steady cam, and close ups. The close ups really showed the emotion of Oscar Isaac (more on him later on in the review). The cinematography was also on point. This wasn't done by Roger Deakins, like in a lot of their movies. This time it was done by Bruno Delbonnel. The shots were all very pretty, and one scene in particular I liked. Well two. The beginning, when Oscars character walks outside, and gets beaten. And I said two, because in the end of the movie is the same scene. This is because this scene chronologically takes place after all the events of the movie, but in the beginning they want you to believe that this scene takes place before everything. That and the directing made this scene stand out for me. The acting was also great and the writing as well. What I also loved is that in the end they used other shots. But enough about that scene. The sound editing was good too. Some sound design was a bit doubtable but I still liked it. The editing overall was done fantastically. I absolutely loved it in this movie. The long takes of Oscar singing were fantastic.The acting was fantastic, and due to one of the actors I decided to watch the movie. This actor was also the main actor, and this was Oscar Isaac. Last year I saw him act in two movies, where he played two totally different characters. In 'Ex Machina' he was an asshole-ish character and he absolutely nailed it. And in 'Star Wars' he was a very likable person, which he also nailed. Thanks to those roles I wanted to see more from him, and I so ended up with this movie. So, how was he? Bloody fantastic, I'll tell you that. He plays an interesting character and is very convincing at it too. I first didn't like him, but as the movie progresses you start to care more. His counterpart was played by Carey Mulligan. She was also very good. In the park-scene especially. The emotion in her face just feels so real. I was the most surprised by her. Justin Timberlake is also in this movie. For the second time he proves he can in fact act. He was very good. John Goodman also makes an appearance. Which wasn't really a surprise knowing this is a Coen movie. When he appeared the movie became better and better. There were some funny lines said by him and he delivers them greatly. I firstly was surprised that Garrett Hedlund acts in this movie. I firstly didn't recognize him, but also by his acting capabilities he surprised me. The only role I've seen him is was in 'Tron', which wasn't his greatest role. In case you didn't get it, he was very good. In this part I won't only talk about the screenplay, but also about the songs. So the screenplay was also written by the Coens. This is most of the time a very good part of their movies, and this time it is too. The jokes, when they are there, were funny. This was mostly dark, and subtle humor, the kind I like. I wouldn't classify this movie as a comedy, though. The normal dialogue was also very good, but sometimes the dialogue-less parts were the greatest, just because a picture can tell much more than words, especially if you have the Coens behind the camera. The characters were also very good. Like I've said was Oscars character, Llewyn, interesting. He was unpredictable at times. He had his outbursts, but that's how his 'job' has made him. He's at the edge of everything. He has potentially made his ex pregnant, he has lost the cat he has to watch. His life has turned into a living hell. And throughout the movie you start to care about him, and feel sorry fir him.Another thing that surprised me from the movie was the songs. I normally don't listen to this genre, but I absolutely loved the songs. The performances if them were handled greatly, thanks to the voice of Oscar. The lyrics also fitted his character very well. There were also some funny songs, like the Kennedy song, which, in my opinion, was also pretty good.9.5/10",9,1,1,12 June 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," Didn't deserve all of these Oscars, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a good one!
","Last night I saw 'Slumdog Millionair', so here is my review for it.Lets start with a little synopsis of the movie. The movie is about Jamal. We see his live, but also see bits of how he won the TV-show, due to an interrogation. Did he cheat? Didn't he? Did he win the maximum prize?This movie was directed by the wonderful director Danny Boyle, but this time he got some help of Loveleen Tandan. I believe she directed the bits that were filmed in India. I've seen another film of Boyle called '127 hours' a fantastic movie, with a special style to it. Boyel transferred that style to this movie as well. It was recognizable and I like when this is there Christopher Nolan too has a recognizable, and Quentin Tarrantino as well. Boyle used some very pretty and impressive aerial shots, where I sometimes thought that Cg was involved, but that it just wasn't noticeable. The directing wasn't of course the only good thing about the directing. The cinematography was also on point. But this is of course also thanks to the wonderful directing. There was this cliché shot, but this worked in the movie. The shot is when little Jamal and his brother are being followed by the police. This was pretty early on in the movie. Now that were the technical visual aspects of the movie. An audible aspect was the soundtrack. This was a very good part of the movie. It fitted the overall theme, but also the moments in the movie. The sound effects were also very good. Another thing that I really liked was the editing. It was done very good, without any mistakes that I could spot. But thanks to this editing the pacing was also very good.The acting as well was very good. The main character was played by I believe 3 actors. The adult version and the kid version of him. Jamal, the protagonist, was played by Dev Patel. This is the first good movie that I've seen of him. But that isn't a big surprise because the only other movie that I've seen of him is 'That Last Airbender'. In that movie he over-acted, but in this movie though, he was very good. He did the emotional lines very good, and nailed the funny lines. Actually, all of his line delivery was very good. The kid versions were also very good. They were the most surprising, all of them. For their age it was very impressive. His counterpart for most of the movie was his brother. He too was good. The adult version was less good than the kid actors. The actress of Latika was also very good. The antagonists of the movie were the presenter and Prem. Prem was played by someone who also acted in 'The Last Airbender' This was Anil Kapoor. He too was good. And the presenter was also very good. With every time Jamal won something you could see the hate in his face, even though he was smiling.The script is something that I'm not so sure about. It had its good parts but also some bad ones. Let's start with the story overall. This was good. It was told in a creative way, with a bit of a 'Usual Suspects' vibe. I was expecting a twist at the end of the movie, but there wasn't one. Like I just said, the story overall was good, but some bits weren't. Like the scene where he crawled through sh*t. This was for me more of a part to amuse the kids that ended up watching the movie for some reason. This was dull. Another little problem I have with the movie is the conveniences. That it was all to convenient that exactly those things happened in his life that were asked, and that's why I started to speculate that it would go full 'Usual Suspects' I'm glad that they didn't, because that would've ruined the whole movie. There was also some good humor in the movie. The fat help cop had some funny one-liners and so did Jamal. No that I have that out of the way. How were the characters? very good. That's my answer to that question. Jamals and his brothers characters were well developed throughout the story by showing bits of their past. But due to the acting of Jamals actors I was more invested in his character than in his brothers. The character of Latika was good at moments, but annoying at moments too. Like in the last scene. When she was running to the car with the phone in it. This was rather frustrating, and she was useless at that moment too. You could argue that she was the motivation for Jamal, and I would like to discus that with you, because I think that she didn't have any influence to Jamal at that moment. The dialogue overall was also very good.Well, that was my review for this movie. I don't think that it deserved all of these Oscars, but it isn't a bad movie. It's still very good. That's why I give this movie an 8.3/10",8,1,3,19 June 2016
The Nice Guys," A fresh take on the genre, with fantastic writing.
","Some Spoilers Might Have Slipped Through.'The Nice Guys' follows two private detectives who are both looking for a girl called Amelia, who has a connection to the death of a porn star. This movie was directed by Shane Black, who has also written the screenplay for the movie. He did a really good job at directing. His use of shadow is amazing. One scene in particular stood out to me. This was the one, where March falls down the cliff, and discovers the body of someone. By his use of shadow the body stays hidden, but you can feel that something is there by the camera movement. When March uses his lighter we finally see the reveal and the body is shown. That scene is handled in such a comical and scary way, with beautiful cinematography that it might be my favorite scene of the entire movie. But this is just one example of the use of shadow. He uses this a lot, but most of the time the were not used to enforce the comedic element of the scene. The lighting in the night scenes were also nicely done. He also uses very cool camera movements, especially the ones where he moves the camera from a driving car, goes up in the air, gives a shot of LA, and than goes to the place they are driving. There are a couple of them in the movie, but it never get's tiring. He also handled the action scenes very well. They were cut and shot like they were done in the 80's. He also managed to put some comedic elements in these scenes which gave a nice whole. To give one minor criticism is on the editing. This is near the end of the movie, when Gosling and Crowe are sitting at a bar. Crowe's often puts the cigar in his mouth and smokes it, but when there were different cuts, you could see his hand suddenly switching positions and the length of the cigar can also grow or shrink between cuts. This is really my only bit of criticism on the technical side of the movie.The acting also was very good. March, who I've mentioned earlier was played by Ryan Gosling. Before going into the movie, I knew that he was going to be good, that's just how Gosling acts. Now I've seen the movie, I can confirm my thoughts going into the movie. Gosling made his character feel real and gave something more to it than just the character that was written down. You could see that his character had a damaged past. Russel Crowe also was very good. He played the other private detective. He also brought a lot to the character, not in the way Gosling did, but by gaining weight. This added to how you felt about his character and pointed out his style of living. Both Gosling and Crowe had very good chemistry and they play with it, which only makes the movie better and funnier. Goslings character also has a daughter and she was very good. She played with emotion and was convincing. There were multiple antagonists in the movie, but I'll just pick one, and this one is played by Matt Bomer. I picked him, because I didn't know he was in the movie. The character he plays here is totally different than any others he has played beforeThe writing was, like I've said, written by Shane Black. But he had some help with it by Anthony Bagarozzi. The script was absolutely the best part of the whole movie. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I laughed with every joke, and still thinking back of them, or reading them on the 'quote' part on IMDb, I laugh, not out loud, but chuckles. Which is not a bad thing, because the movie was not aiming for me to laugh uncontrollably. There were some on going jokes in the movie, and every time they're still funny. The story was well thought out and complex. It was interesting to follow, due to said complexity, but also due to the great dialogue overall, not just the jokes. The characters were multi-layered and differed from each other. Like the difference between Russel Crowes character and Ryan Goslings. Both are very different, yet they seem very similar. Both are damaged people, but March is just less professional. The character I really want to mention is Holly, the daughter of March. She was useful in the movie. She was funny and smart and actually helped to get the story move. She was not just some one there to be funny or be cute or something. No she actually did something and that's really seldom looking at the movies that come out today. The bad guy, played by Matt Bomer, was good. His character was scary and hidden throughout the movie, but this only made him more threatening. The character was just not that well developed as I would've liked to see, but still a good character.In the end this was a very good movie, the best movie that came out in 2016, that I've seen, even. The directing was very good, the characters were varied and well acted. The jokes were funny and don't get boring. The story was well thought out and fitted well together in the end of the movie.9.5/10",10,4,9,2 October 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Best movie of 2015 so far!
","Mad max: fury road is, obviously about Max. The story is pretty basic, and not hard to understand at all. Max (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) have to get a truck filled with women to one place, the green place. But these women were important to Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Immortant Joe is the leader from a gang. So now he has sent a big group of his people in cars to get the truck with the women and kill Max and Furiousa. THis movie is basically just a long chase scene, but an amazing chase scene...The directing of the movie was so pretty. Sometimes I just sat there stunned by how pretty it was. Really everything was just beautiful, I also really liked the colors they used. Even the fighting scenes were good, no shaky cam, just wide open shots of the people fighting. Another thing about the fighting, it was very well choreographed. I think that the fight scene in the beginning between Furiosa and Max was one of my favorite fight scenes. The car scenes were very well shot too. But here is a thing that I didn't really liked, that they sped up the camera movement. If you know what I mean, I don't really know how to express that in English. I enjoyed when they let things fly in the direction of the camera for example: When someone (spoiler) sacrifices him/herself there fly a steering wheel and a guitar in to the camera. I think it would have been cool if you watched it in 3D. (no spoilers) The use of practical effects surprised me. I knew that there would be some practical effects but there were a lot. And I think that it was really cool that they used them, because now a days you only see CGI. These practical effects added something more to the movie, in my opinion. The special effects were also very well done (the mechanical hand of Furiosa. George Miller (the director) made good use of slow motion. Now something more about the acting. Tom Hardy was very good as Max. First you don't really know a lot about Max (of course if you have seen the previous 3 movies you know who Max is), but then with the short flashbacks of this little girl you start to see that Max is a damaged man who has been trough a lot. A short thing about these flashbacks, I thought that it was very creative that they switched between the faces and the skulls of dead people when they blame Max. And that the little girl had impact on Max. Max begin narration was very good. Charlize Theron is just a total badass as Furiosa, I very much liked her character. And I loved that they didn't make her invincible. Also liked her dedication by shaving of her hair. My favorite character is Nux, he is played by Nicholas Hoult. I like Nux because he is this interesting character. Nux is so interesting because he shows that his people care, and that they weren't all weird, violent people. The writing is overall very good.Here are some more things that I liked about this movie. I very much enjoyed the realistic sense to it, it felt very realistic, and I think that is due to the use of practical effects. The sound and music was nice to listen to. The costume and make-up design is just amazing. And maybe the thing that I loved the most about this movie is that I wasn't bored for a second. Now last but not least there is a freaking guy playing the guitar which spits flames, if you don't think that that is cool, there is something wrong with you. And here are some individual scores:Directing: 9.8/10Writing: 9.5/10Acting: 9.6/10Action: 10/10that is a total of 38.6/40 which is a 9.7/10. And if I would round it, it would be a 10/10. I would definitely recommend watching this movie it is just pure fun.",10,3,11,15 August 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," War from a pacifist view
","'Hacksaw Ridge' is about the pacifist Desomond Doss, who refuses to pick up a gun, but somehow still manages to save over 70 lives in the battle of Okanawa.Last night I saw this movie and 'The accountant' back to back, and I have to say that this movie was the best out of the both. Mel Gibsons directing was on point. After ten years of doing no directing, he still has it. His shot composition is very good and he has put some symbolism in the last frame. Quite obvious, but still. He also managed to created a realistic feel for the movie. Mel also has some for shadowing going on in the movie. It doesn't happen once or twice, but a couple of times. I didn't really mind it, but maybe you could get annoyed by this. Mel Gibsons way of showing war was very good. He put down hell on screen. A lot of things helped him with this thing, the make- up design for example. The make-up looked very real. It reminded me of 'Saving Private Ryan'. Heads and other body parts were flying everywhere. The costume design too was really good. The movie also reminded me of 'Full Metal Jacket' in a way. The training sequences looked similar and there was the drill sergeant. It kind of mirrors the movie in my opinion.What Mel Gibson also did well were the battle sequences. If they are there, they hit hard. You feel so involved in those scenes. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time, with goosebumps. The score was loud and worked perfectly with those scenes. An example of the well-crafted score is in the first battle sequence and also my favorite part of the movie. This is with the mist hanging there, hiding everything in a threatening way. The score slowly building up to the reveal. The slow editing. And then action breaks loose and the score is at its peak, with the pacing suddenly moving faster than before. That part was really brilliantly handled by Mel Gibson and he gave me chills in those parts. Something that he also did right were the scenes where Desmond is the only one up there saving everyone. You are constantly sitting on the edge of your seat. At first I thought that it was going to get repetitive after a while (him constantly doing the same thing trying to help people), but Gibson managed to keep me interested, by showing new things constantly. The scenery in those scenes were good looking, jaw dropping even, but sometimes the Cgi was notable.Now I've been praising the movie a lot for the battle sequences, but there are two things that I want to mention, which I didn't like from those parts. One is the scene where Desmond saves Sgt Howell, by dragging him on a blanket. That was just ridiculous. The ground was uneven everywhere and yet he pulls him forward like it's nothing, without any bumps even. Sgt Howell also just keeps shooting at the Japps like he is Rambo. And another thing I disliked was the cheap way that Desmond escapes from the Japps in the tunnels. That was lazy movie magic. And a thing that I disliked a tiny bit, is that the first act takes a long time to set up the rest of the movie. But after the first act, everything becomes ten times better.The acting was really good. Andrew Garfield gave his best performance yet. He really showed how his character evolved from a normal boy, to a damaged man. He shone on the battlefield, with all the emotion he had. He could say things, without even speaking. His accent was very good. Hugo Weaving, who played Desmonds dad, really was fantastic too. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination, there's something wrong with them. I think that Weaving managed to show what war could do to a man. He gave in my opinion the best performance of the movie. Someone that surprised me was Vince Vaughn. This was one of his more serious roles, and I think that he should keep doing them. He was phenomenal as the drill sergeant. Not as good as the one in 'Full Metal Jacket', but still very good. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey are good in this movie. I didn't even realize that I was watching Worthington act. And last but not least: Teresa Palmer. She was very good, and also gave the performance of her career,. Which does not say much if you look at the other movies she has been in.The script was good. It was good in the dialogue aspect, but very good in the charactorial aspect. The characters were well developed and had its arcs. We go from Smitty hating Desmond, to them building up a friendship. We go from a normal young man, to a damaged one. There were also some cliché characters (The hand someone, the nerd...), but they need to be there, because of the giant amount of other characters. The cliché ones are easier to recognize on the field. Some of the characters that they set up, were being underused in my opinion. Like I've said before I think that they could've left some bits out in the beginning of the movie. I understand why they put those things in there. They wanted to set up the characters believes and motivation for it, and give him some more substance, but it just took them to long to do this.So that's my opinion of 'Hacksaw Ridge', I probably forgot some things to say, because there's a lot to say about this movie. It's one of my favorites of 2016 and that's why I'm giving this one a 9.6/10.",10,12,23,12 November 2016
All the President's Men," A movie that deserves a re-watch, and a re-watch, and a re-watch...
","'All the President's Men' is about two journalists who try to uncover details from the Watergate scandal.'All the President's Men' was brilliantly directed by Alan J. Pakula. He really did an amazing job at directing. He created a realistic movie. And he looked out for the details. When a character is further away from the camera, the voice of said character is way more quiet than the voice of someone standing right in front of the camera for example. Or when a plane flies by, and the characters have to yell, so the other one understands them. But the realism doesn't end there. He used some techniques to immerse you into the movie. An example of this is when the camera is focused on two different things at the same time. Mostly with the one thing being right in front of the camera and the other being in the background. The technique is not used a lot on today's standards, but directors like Quentin Tarrantino use it once in a while. But normally they choose to focus on two characters. In this movie Alan J. Pakula decided to make the camera focus on one character, but the other thing is completely random. Well, not completely random. The other thing was most of the time a distraction, to show how hard it is to concentrate at the given time. This only makes you feel like you are there right with the characters and it gives a very immersive feel to it. Another cool detail was the use of wide angle shots. This was used to make it feel like you were being watched, which fits the theme of the movie perfectly. He is also a very good visual director. Like I've just said, he uses a lot of wide shots. These shots were always beautifully composed. There were a couple of scenes I liked in particular. The scenes where Woodward goes to meet his informant. The use of lighting and color were on point. The wide shots looked stunning. But not only the wide shots. In the close ups the shadows were used creatively, which gave an amazing effect. Another scene that visually stood out to me was the scene in the elevator. The characters partially hidden in shadows made the shot look very good. These were just the ones that I personally found amazing to look at, but that's mostly because I very much like the use of shadow in scenes. Alan J. Pakula also used long takes in which the camera managed to capture every character in a beautiful way. You'd expect that, when the camera is moving, not all characters would be positioned in a good spot, but because of the brilliance of Alan J. Pakula, this is what happened. The pacing was also really good.Now that that's out of the way, let's go over to the actors. There were two protagonists in the story Bernstein and, the previous named Woodward. Woodward was played by Robert Redford. I think that this is his best performance that I've seen from him, even though the Oscars seem to disagree with me. He absolutely deserved an Oscar for this role. His dedication to the role payed of and he felt so natural. The same goes for his colleague, Dustin Hoffman. He too deserved an Oscar, or at least a nomination, for his natural performance. But these were just the main performances. The supporting cast was really good. The members of the CREEP really showed fear in their eyes and were very convincing.The screenplay was also fantastic. It was written with such care. The information that you needed to figure out everything was there, but just not told right in your face. The dialogues were realistic. First we see men talk things through, before something relevant to the plot happens. It doesn't go straight to the point as in your average movies. No, they take time to set the scene up. The dialogue is also intriguing and you want to know what the person is going to say next. I've read in the trivia section of IMDb that Hoffman and Redford learned each others lines so they could interrupt each other during a conversation. And they did. It paid of very well. this only made the movie getting more realistic. The characters were not developed in a way that they tell you: 'oh his parents died'. (This is not in the movie, just an example) In 'All the President's Men', they do this in subtle ways. You can see immediately that Bernstein is a perfectionist and that Woodward is a realist. Their characters are developed by actions and subtle things, rather than someone with a big red arrow above their head yelling from the roof which character traits each character has. I've said that the screenplay was written with care, and with this I mean that they really watched out with what the characters said in which scene. If the character said something else, the scene would've lost it's power, which is not a good thing.If you don't get it: I love this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie. The acting and directing were absolutely on point. The attention for detail is remarkable and the writing is intriguing. This movie is going up on my favorite movie list. This movie get's a 10/10",10,3,3,16 October 2016
The Martian," 'Hello darkness my old friend...'
","I will explain the title further on in the review.So 'The Martian' is about Mark Watny, a botanist. He and his crew members were on a mission, the Ares III mission. But at sol 18 (one sol is a day at mars), there happens something bad, there is a storm. Due to this storm Watney and his crew have to abort the mission and get of off Mars. While the evacuation takes place Watney gets hit by an antenna, and is impaled by it. His crew thinks that he is dead, and leave him behind. Alone at Mars. But Mark didn't die by the antenna, he survived. Now he has to 'sience the 'Beep' out of this' to stay alive, and wait for rescue. 'The Martian' is directed by Ridley Scott. This man has directed some classics and good movies (e.g. 'Blade Runner', 'Alien', 'Gladiator'), but also some bad ('Exodus: Gods and Kings', 'The consoler', 'GI Jane'). I think that this movie should be on his 'good movies' list. The film was beautifully shot. The effects were stunningly beautiful. Scott did an amazing job at directing this movie, and I am glad that they chose him to direct 'The Martian'. The landscape the used the recreate the landscape of Mars, was also very well chosen, it really felt like you were on Mars. You could see the landscape really wheel, when there were some aerial shots, who looked beautiful. Like I just said, the effects were stunning, you just couldn't see when they used green screen. You obviously knew it, but you couldn't see it. What I also liked was the costume design. The space suits used on Mars looked nice, but also practical. The suits made me think of the suits in 'Prometheus', also a movie by Ridley Scott. On the 'trivia' section on IMDb I also read that it is inspired by it. The sound in the movie was very surprising. It was well edited and chosen, it felt very realistic. What also helped to keep this movie so realistic, is the science behind it all. The science is mostly correct, and that is what I liked the most about the movie. Weirdly enough there were enough tense moments throughout the movie, but it is a good thing.The acting is handled very well. Matt Damon was amazing as Mark Watney. He plays Mark as a positive, funny guy, who sees the best in almost every situation. But he also has his breaking point. Sometimes he just finds the most weird ways to laugh with somebody, but it is still funny. He was just like I imagined him in the book. Jessica Chastian played Lewis. Lewis was the leader of the mission. She is a caring leader who doesn't want to leave a man behind, and when she has to leave Mark behind, she is devastated. Chastian did a good job at portraying her. Some other crew members are Kate Mara, she played Johanson. She definitely redeemed herself after 'Fantastic Four'. You also have Sebastian Stan, he plays Beck, who turns out to be a love interest for Johanson. He did a good job as well. There is Alex Vogel, he is played by Aksel Hennie. He played a German astronaut. He was also pretty good. And the last crew member is Martinez. He is played by Michael Peña. I very much liked his character. He and Mark were both hilarious, and it was just fun when they had a conversation. He acted very good. This movie doesn't only focus on Mark and his crew, it also focuses on NASA's side. Here you have Jeff Daniels, he plays the head of NASA and is very good at it. There is also Sean Bean, who plays Mitch Henderson. He did a good job at portraying him. In case you wondered he doesn't die at the end. Vincent Kapoor is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, I have nothing really to say about him. And my favorite character of NASA's side is Rich Purnell. He was played by Donald Glover. He was very convincing as a smart, but messy boy. I very much liked the writing of the movie, this was maybe even the best part of the movie. It was funny at times, but also clear when they explained the science stuff. It had its emotional moments, and I liked that. You also cared about Watney and didn't want him to die, that was due to the script. I was glad that Andy Weir, the writer of the book, could help writing the script of the movie. I didn't really like that they left out some funny moments from the book (I have read it) for example: The aqua man part. And what I didn't get was why they cut away at the part where Watney is trying to anger NASA. But as I said in the beginning of my review, I am going to explain my title for this review. With 'Darkness' I was talking about Ridley Scott. This is because he has made a bunch of had movies lately. This is why I symbolize him with the 'Darkness' part. But also with the 'Old friend' part, this is because he made a bunch of good movies back in the day, that is why the 'Old' part.Thank you for reading this review, I hope you think that it is useful. I would recommend this movie to everyone who liked 'Gravity', but with a bit more science. I would also recommend it to everyone who has read the book, and if you haven't read the book, then go read it! The movie is a very good movie, and I hope you will see it.",9,2,8,10 October 2015
Furious 7," An over the top movie, but still fun to watch
","I have watched the extended version so keep that in mind while reading this review, also at the ending of my review are gonna be some spoilersSo Furious 7 is again about Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew. His crew has just lost a member (I am not going to say who they have lost because I want to make this a spoiler free review). This person has been killed by Deckard Shaw. Deckard is the brother of Owen Shaw, Owen was the villain in the previous movie. In furious 6 they almost killed him. Now his brother (Deckard) searches for revenge against Dom and his crew. But now that Deckard has killed someone of their crew they also search for revenge against Deckard...I did the best as I could to explain the story because it kind of doesn't make sense. If you have already seen the movie you will probably get what I am going to say now, and if you haven't seen the movie you could see this as a minor spoiler. So to find Deckard, Dom and the crew have to search this device that can track Deckard. But with each part that they get closer to finding that device Deckard shows up, He literally shows up almost everywhere they are! So what I don't get is why they just didn't have a whole team of SWATT guys standing there ready to take down Shaw? OK now that I have said that lets talk about the directing. It is directed by James Wan (the same guy from 'The Conjuring') The begin fight scene between Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) is pretty good, not to fast edited, and there are no shaky cams. Also the driving sequences and when they jumped out of the plane with cars was pretty well directed. And the fighting scene in the bus with Brian (Paul Walker) and this Asian guy wasn't directed that great, here was it to fast edited and you couldn't really see what was going on. They also used slow motion very often, it was used nice at times but it was also a lot of the time unnecessary.Here is a bit more about the writing and acting. Statham was like Statham is in every movie, but his begin lines were pretty good actually, also when he walks out of the hospital it is funny to see all the SWATT guys on the floor because you didn't expect it to be like that. Paul Walker was also pretty good as Brian, he just fits the character. Vin Diesel is what you would expect from Vin Diesel a very monotone acting job. His best scene was at the funeral of the person they have lost. Dwayne Johnson was my favorite character of the crew, and i thought it was stupid that they only put him in the movie for a couple of minutes, but he still acted pretty well. I also liked that they put Hobbs in the hospital so you can see that he is also a human and not some invincible being, but he is the only one that gets hurt in the entire movie, the rest of them are like super humans, because they are also very strong. Natalie Emmanuel was very good, I liked her very much in the movie, Jordana Brewster was good for the part of the movie where she was in, because she (just like Hobbs) had not much screen time. the rest of the crew had Oké performances. The writing was not too bad, the jokes thy put in to the script were funny for most of the times. I didn't like that they made everyone to powerful, they should have made the characters more human, and venerable. There are a lot of clichés in Furious Seven, but i didn't really mind. Some parts are also pretty over the top, HERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME SPOILERS, like when they jump from the one building to the other and the fighting scenes are sometimes pretty funny. Because it is so over the top. And near the ending of the movie when Dom stamps on the floor and takes down Shaw is just laughable. The ending is also pretty straight forward, the bad guy gets captured, bla bla bla. But the last couple of scenes are very emotional. the special effects are very well done. I would definitely recommend this movie, just don't think to much with it and you will have a great time watching it!",7,0,14,8 August 2015
