The Rock," Cool and Exhilarating story
","I loved this movie, specially cause there is no real 'villian' in it.(of course apart from those mercenaries that go berserk near the end). Its more of good against reality, where decisions have to be made that wouldn't necessary turn out to be 'right' at the end. Michael Bay is an excellent director when it comes to keepin the movie on an up-tempo till the end of it. Also must emphasis on the music...awesome ! The script was cool as well and sean connery and nicolas cage does a fine job with it. One thing i got to know after watching was that Ed Harris is an ideal match for playing a a military leader. (E.g; The German sniper in Enemy at the Gate) He should focus more in playing such roles. This is one of my all time favorites !!!!",8,2,2,20 January 2005
Alexander," Horrible Music
","Apart from the directing(OK) , acting (which is average) and set ups and costumes (marvellous) the Music was awful !!!!!!. Specifically during the Persia battle scene the music was so out of place. It sounded like the music was in the 20th century while the battle scene is 1000s of years behind. This really brought down the effect and quality of this movie. Also no offense to the composer, but I've never heard of him before. Musicians like James Horner(Troy) or John Williams should have been involved in this kinda 'epic' movie. These types of movies specifically depends on the music to carry the drama throughout the film. In Alexander, that did not happen....to me of course :). Yours thoughts ?",5,2,5,17 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Gap between the 2 trilogies !
","Is it just me or has anyone noticed the fact that, Obi-wan gets to know the droids (specially R2 in ST3) and in the 4th episode, obi-wan clearly states that he doesn't know them !!!!!!!! I think george has made this slight error...of course it doesn't do that much of harm to the story line....Also looking at the whole series now, its clear that the story is based upon Anakin and not on Luke. I personally believe that someone older should have played Anakin in ST3. He looks just too young ! Also i still don't understand why Lucas didn't start off from the very first episode instead of starting with the fourth ????Star wars gheek !!!!",8,2,3,14 June 2005
