Blade Runner 2049," Harrison please send me a refund.
","I have never wanted to exit a movie early until Blade Runner 2049. Don't waste your money. I have never written a negative review on a movie till now. I expected a great plot and acting with Harrison involved, very disappointing. I read good reviews on this before going to see it. Don't believe them. Take the wife to dinner and forget this movie - absolutely terrible.",Null,7,16,7 October 2017
