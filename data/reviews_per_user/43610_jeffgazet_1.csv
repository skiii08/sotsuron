Ford v Ferrari," A very good story
","It is a beautiful human adventure very well told. I'm not a fan of car racing because I think it's stupid. But in this adventure, the important thing is the innovation influenced by this great race at Le Mans and to push the limits. Great story.",9,1,2,29 November 2019
