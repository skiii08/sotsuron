The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Don't waste your money
","If i were you i wouldn't go to the cinema, I've already wasted my money don't waste yours too. The division in two parts is merely commercial, they haven't earned enough money with the first and the second movie (sarcasm). In principle the division could have been a good thing for the scenography, the narration and so on, but they have cut the story in the wrong point. In the end we have a slow and boring movie. In the most of the film there wasn't any action, just one arrow is shot by Katniss through all the movie! And in the majority of the film there was no tension. I didn't like the scenography, i.e. what they have chosen to play. The book is so much better. So, my advise is: Buy the book and read it, Don't Watch this crappy movie!",3,26,37,23 November 2014
