First Man," Makes walking on the moon incredibly BORING!
","This movie was awful - at least the first hour, because that's all I could watch. It was a struggle to make it through that much.Barely any dialogue, the camera work is so close, and shaky, during the flight
scenes that you can't make out what you're seeing, and the whole thing was just an incredible downer. The characters have only two emotions - serious and somber. It's an emotionally dark movie, draining, and did I mention BORING!?",3,10,17,23 November 2018
Sicario," Yawn...
","Poorly done - it's not character driven and has, until the 60 minute mark, no discernible plot, which, given it's a plot driven script, is difficult to watch.The first hour of this movie that could easily have fit into 12 minutes. 3 minutes if you just wanted dialogue ;) It's not quite an action flick at all - it's more suspense/thriller. The problem, for me, was that you can't have suspense without a story and you don't know, until 53 minutes into the movie, what, exactly, is going on. While the acting is good, I just can't bring myself to suffer through the entire 'greatness' of this movie.I don't doubt that it may pick up and get better, but after an hour of 'wow, this is dragging and painful' I just can't risk that it may continue on at the same pace. It's long periods of filler with moments of talking and Brolin smiling a lot, Blunt soul searching, and Benicio grumbling stuff.There was also a 3-4 minute scene, where hardly nothing was said, that this kid wakes up dad, mom is cooking, then we see the dad in his police uniform, and then nothing further with those charactersand that was about 15 minutes into the movieso 45 minutes go by with them not being seen again? Maybe they appear at the 61 minute mark ;)",4,13,25,21 December 2015
