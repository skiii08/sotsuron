The Ring," Don't watch this before going to bed
","I thought this film was excellent and not damaged by the hype at all. It's creepy and slightly disturbing as opposed to traditionally scary, which I found MUCH more effective. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend watching this film with the lights off ASAP.",9,1,1,17 August 2003
Hostel," OK - could be better
","Not really a bad film in it's own right I was expecting twists, turns and fantastic story telling However got predictable story & clichÃ© American hero, with lots of blood and slashing. This may be because it's based on true events leaving less room for writing a story - which is fair enough. But as a horror film in it's own right it leaves much to be desired. In summary it's a teenage kid gets slashed up film not a suspension, creepy, psychological film. If your looking for blood and visually unpleasant scenes your going to enjoy it as the film it is, however if like me your into great story and twists & turns I'd give this film a miss",2,1,2,31 May 2006
Blade Runner," Amazing
","I watched this film out of curiosity as we studied it in university. And I have to say I was not at all disappointed.This is without a doubt my favourite film of all time, and one of the only films I can watch over and over again and still love it as much.It's got it all, it has a great plot and makes you think.
It may look a little dated by todays standards, but you really don't care as soon as you have got involved with the plot and the journey the film takes you on.If you haven't seen it, I strongly suggestion you do at the earliest opportunity, and I hope you love it as much as I do.",10,0,1,22 October 2003
