The New World," Excruciating extended version
","I don't know how much difference there is between the normal and the extended version, but having seen the latter, my comment in short is that it was simply a torture to watch.First the music was atrocious. The first 10 minutes is a continuous soup of all cords together on an organ, doing a powerful 'Vvvvvvv...' that drills into your brain. We turned the volume most of the way down until it stopped just at a time where we were getting ready to turn off the movie for good.Then the editing is very non linear. In scenes with groups of people you have quick camera changes between 5 or more viewpoints, making everything confused. Sometimes it's seen from somebody's perspective, then from above, then from the side... It's acceptable for battle scenes, but not every time there's more than 2 people on screen ! The timing is also very confused: it's daylight, then suddenly it's nighttime and then 2s later it's daylight again in a scene that is the continuity of the previous one. Hint: if you want to give the sense of passing time, don't put the same scene more than once ! The dynamics of the various situations are also very confused. They are fighting the indians, then on the next scene there are some in the camp, trading, then the situation reverts again not giving us any hint as to why things could have changed.There are so many people loitering and passing by uselessly in the background of every scene that we started laughing after a while.And the main thing that got on my nerves is the constant whispering. There are no dialogs in the movie, only quick one-liners uttered by the characters out of context in the lowest whisper possible. They add nothing to the situations, but I guess they added them because otherwise the audience would fall asleep; at least now they go 'what, what did he say?!?'. Some examples: 'A dog barks', 'The moon shines'... There were some that were complete WTF.So far that goes for a 2/10 movie, but there are some redeeming qualities: the scenery, the indians who are realistic and interesting (even though they seem to spend most of their time waving their arms around) and the actress who can convey a lot in a few wordless facial expressions.Watch the short version, hopefully it's better.",4,1,3,29 March 2010
