Resident Evil: Afterlife," What happened?
","One of the things I like about the Resident Evil films is that they take the time to fill in the details while holding the audience in suspense.This forth film completely falls flat on both accounts. Thanks to 2 dimensional characters, an overdone plot, and poor use of foreshadowing, the entire film is predictable. At the same time it doesn't bother to show or explain how certain important plot devices came to be. The movie reeks from it's overuse of Deus ex machina.The special effects were the only engaging thing about this movie. A lot of it felt like The Matrix in 3D.One other thing this film did well was continuity from the 3rd film. I like that they didn't spend much time on flashbacks while being faithful to the events of the 3rd film.All in all my feeling after seeing the movie was that I was expecting more. They could have made it longer, filled in some missing details, developed the plot/characters more, and had a much more enjoyable film.",4,97,158,30 September 2010
