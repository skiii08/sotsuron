Casablanca," I stick my neck out for Nobody
","....Well, I definitely stick my neck out of this movie. CasaBlanca, as many fans out there concur, is one of the greatest examples of the golden era of the Cinema and their movies. There is beyond any doubt, this movie will become an instant classic of your collection and your heart. Is the one movie, you'll put in a pedestal, touching your inner fibers with random emotions, in the most positive way. A journey back into the past with the 'glamour' that era is remembered. The empathy towards Rick Blaine ( Humphrey Bpgart) will grow and grow as the movie develops, and an ending... that will blow your mind. Is simply the perfect combination of characters, personalities, dialogues, scenery, it is simply EXTRAORDINARY !!!! Spare two hours of your time to watch this movie, and be amazed of an unforgettable experience. And....' Play it, Sam '",10,0,1,15 June 2015
