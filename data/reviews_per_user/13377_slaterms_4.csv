Ghost," Entertaining and provocative...
","Although those of us with a orthodox theological perspective might take issue with the premise, 'Ghost' is a movie that has a lot to offer.  Even non-romance lovers will find plenty of reasons to smile.Patrick Swayze (Sam) is above average (for him).  Demi Moore (Molly) is a bit weak, but not enough to detract.  I've never liked Whoopi Goldberg on general principle, and I detest her on 'Star Trek: T.N.G.'.  Here (as Oda Mae) she shines, as in 'Sister Act'.  Most comical was the scene in the bank as she impersonates a wealthy tycoon-ess.  Sam's reaction to her foibles will have you laughing as well.Another good scene is when the non-corporeal Sam seeks the guidance of the tortured soul on the subway (Vincent Schiavelli).  Reluctant at first, the soul briefly accepts Sam as a sort of afterlife protege.
Most memorable was near the end.  Sam and the traitorous Carl (Tony Goldwyn) square off for the (literally) final showdown.  Afterwards, Carl sees Sam, and seems glad to see him, almost in the old manner.  Knowing that Carl is about to be sent to his 'reward', Sam only regretfully says, 'Oh, Carl.'This movie offers a lot: romance, murder intrigue, betrayal, action, comedy, and the metaphysical.  If you haven't already, give it a try.

The Mist," I didn't like it. . .
","This thriller left a lot to be desired. The trend in many movies seems to utilize poor lighting, bad camera angles, and a constant slight shaking of the camera. Supposedly this makes the movie more 'real', I think it makes it more amateurish and overall more difficult to watch and enjoy. The Mist uses all of these. Plus it is absolutely cheerless, there is no comic relief at all.The movie surrounds an artist (Thomas Jane) trying to protect his little son from The Mist, and the creatures that dwell within. They are trapped by The Mist in a grocery store with his skeptical neighbor(Andre Braugher), a Prohibitionist/Abolitionist era New England religious busybody (Marcia Gay Harden), and a host of other hysterical bunglers.The most skillful and intrepid of those trapped in the store seems to be the meek-looking assistant manager, Ollie (Toby Jones).This movie has all of the predictable themes of a horror movie: a religious nut; the unbelieving, angry skeptic who refuses to believe that there is any real danger until it is too late; the cute kid; etc.*** possible spoiler *** The ending follows the Twilight Zone-ish 'if only the hero waited another thirty seconds before his drastic, final action; things would have been all right'. Not bad, but we have seen it before. Plus very, very sad.Could have been better. 4 out of 10",4,1,3,9 April 2008
Jerry Maguire," Not a total waste of time, but...
","I recently saw 'Jerry Maguire' on NBC.  While it was not the worst movie I have ever seen, it is probably the worst with a pro-football based theme that I can remember.  It was predicatable and woefully saccarine.This was the movie which coined the phrase 'SHOW ME THE MONEY!' back in '96, which I found almost immediately irritating.  Tom Cruise (Jerry Maguire) was his usual over-emoting self.  Renee Zellweger's character (Maguire's love interest, Dorothy) was revolting.  Cuba Gooding Jr, (Maguire's only remaining client, the cocky Rod Tidwell) was annoying throughout.  That little kid (Dorothy's son), although cute, seemed awfully stoic for a youngster when saying goodbye to Maguire when he and his mother were about to move out of Jerry's life.The bright light here was Jay Mohr's excellent portrayal of a sleazy, aggressive, backstabbing fellow sports-agent.  Mohr's portrayal was so good that I found myself wanting to come through the screen an wring his neck -- and this even though I found no emotional attachment to Cruise's character.[possible spoiler warning] ..probably not necessary since this movie was so transparent.The writing and acting was so bad, the outcome so predictable.  Tidwell gets k.o.'d after scoring the winning touchdown, and the world holds its breath. After sufficient nail-biting time, he leaps up, does and end-zone jig, climbs up the side of the stadium, etc...pretty good for someone who just sustained a near-concussion.Tidwell gets his long sought $12.8mil contract(or something like that, the obscene salaries of these guys was about the only believable aspect of this film).   He then hugs everyone in sight and weeps.Maguire enters a ladies divorce support group with Dorothy in attendance and says to her something like 'You will not get rid of me, I won't let you go!' (something that would get many men a restraining order, and their girlfriends a stay at a battered woman's shelter).  Dorothy, of course, takes him back, and they live happily ever after... la la la!Sports fans, you can do much better.  Ditto romance lovers.3 of 10 *s",Null,21,44,28 September 2003
The Waterboy," 'Silly' doesn't begin to describe it
","In this politically-correct addled age, it is good that movies that poke fun of regional/ethnic differences can proliferate.  'The Waterboy', however, was just a little too much.  Even 'Fargo' and 'Raising Arizona' were classier and more even-handed than this.  The Acadians deserve better.Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) plays a not-so-young flop who is fired from his duties as a waterboy.  His mother (Kathy Bates) is controlling and domineering.  Bobby then becomes the waterboy for a rival college football team, where the coach (Henry Winkler) recognizes his talent on the gridiron. Bobby's talent manifests itself when he channels his rage for Mama against the opposition.  Combine that with endless silly stereotypes, and you have just about summed up 'The Waterboy'.On the plus side it is good to see that N.Y. Giants football legend Lawrence Taylor is willing to get a laugh at his own expense (The 'don't do drugs' line).Verdict:  If you have had a particularly horrid week at work, and your brain has become mush so that you cannot handle the intellectual level of 'The Shawshank Redemption' or even 'Police Academy', 'The Waterboy' might be just perfect.  Also for hard-core Sandler fanciers.4 of 10",Null,1,3,23 October 2003
