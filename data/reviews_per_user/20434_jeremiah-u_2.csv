Source Code," Awesome !! .............as simple as that.
","Don't have much to say. This movie is the best sci-fi after Matrix i've ever seen. Amazing movie. From the very beginning, till the end it's really interesting. I don't want to put even a slightest clue about what this movie is all about. I believe you should watch it yourself. This movie really makes you think about things you would like to do. What if life gives you a second change to correct things. Thing you would like to do before you die. Think about things you really wished for.About the movie, this movie has got very few instances where profanity has been used, which is something I like. It's not like other movies for 200 and above f words which makes it irritating sometimes.Very mild violence is shown, few kissing scene which is OK.",8,2,4,11 June 2011
The Others," Kind of horror movie I would like to watch
","This is the kind of movie that I would always love to watch. Very interesting story. Before I starting watching the movie, I hadn't slept for almost 36 hours. I was very much sure that I'm going to feel sleepy while watching this movie. However this movie was so interesting that after 5 mins for finishing watching this movie, I thought of writing a review. Just like Sixth Sense, this movie has got a very interesting end. The end of this movie was the most interesting part.I never thought Nicole could act so well. Every character in this movie played a very important role. I wish I could watch similar movies like this. Must watch for all.",8,1,3,28 May 2011
