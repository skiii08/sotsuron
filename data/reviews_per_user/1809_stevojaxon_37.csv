Ford v Ferrari," Flying by the seat of the pants
","It just felt like the 60s when I was a kid. Uncomplicated and risky. But it was fun. And this movie reminded me exactly of the attitudes of the times. For me this was just such a rare and treasured experience. I watched the movie from start to finish and every time I had to leave it for a minute, I had to rush back to make sure I didn't miss anything. How can I explain what I was seeing? Enjoyable action performed by masterful actors woven into a meaningful story. Friendship, challenge and trust all displayed in a way that I could enjoy. Trial and error engineering before computers took over the decision process ... wow what a magical time to be alive. The Le Mans wins by the Ford GT40 on 66, 67, 68 and 69 ... epic effort and akin to the first Moon landing as far as motor sports is concerned. In this current political landscape, I can imagine that people who weren't alive then, being dismissive of this story. But for me it was a magical experience and I am grateful that this movie was created.",10,5,8,2 January 2020
The Equalizer," Virtue, valor, strength and Denzel to bring it all together
","It is going to be good even before I see it. Denzel picks roles that work for him; the budget is there to support it; and the film maker is good at what he does. It's a formula and it works to produce movies that I enjoy ... a lot. In recent years there have been similar hero / anti-hero movies coming out with big name stars playing them. I remember a lot of them being similarly good. After I watched the Equalizer, I thought to myself that I knew it was going to be good.",8,2,3,30 December 2019
John Wick," Lit wick explodes
","What a surprise! Was this action, was this sci-fi, was this the guy who played Ted? This movie took me to places I didn't know existed. For me it just reeked originality, grit and it was a wild, welcome ride. Nowadays you see this type of thing coming out of Hollywood all the time. They have the budget, they know their audiences and good action flicks are always welcomed ... even if people pretend to want peace, love and goodwill towards their fellow man/woman ... the thirst for gladiators and blood sport lingers deep in the psyche of civilized man ... it's the way that it is. So why does it work so well in John Wick? Beats me as I've seen variations of this before. And yes they have turned this into a franchise, so now there is more John Wick 2 and 3 ... I am so glad there is. Never mess with a dog lover.",8,1,2,30 December 2019
Rocketman," Rock a doodle do
","I suppose Rocketman had to be made. It reminds me of some of the other biopics that have been coming out in the last couple of years. The producers of these movies have probably been noticing that other movies featuring other artists have been popular. So I guess they've decided now is the right time. Strike while the iron is hot as has been said. I watched it to the end and I enjoyed it. The music is there. Flamboyance aplenty and English accents in abundance. There's drama, pop star excesses, synchronized dancing and fantasy scenes. What more could I want? Well, there's a whole lot of things that I wish for that aren't going to happen, as it's now been edited and released. What I secretly want is a movie that makes me give it a 9 or 10 rating. The significance of the artist is that he is a 9 or 10 artist who has had an important influence over the music scene. After all, he really is in a league of his own ... virtual rock and roll royalty. Wouldn't it be nice if the movie truly reflected this? ... my opinion only of course ...",7,0,1,30 December 2019
A Star Is Born," This movie is like fast food
","I remember a time when my mother cooked and food was good for me. Then fast food crept into my life, to make me feel good but wasn't made with love and care. This is how I feel about a lot of movies coming out now. A Star is Born 2018 is an entertaining movie, that appears to me to be well made, with what seems to me to be a formula, that is used to make me think it is made by someone who loves me. I appreciate their effort. But what I really want is a fierce honesty so I have to find that elsewhere.",6,2,4,27 December 2019
The Death of Stalin," Sitting on the fence
","I know what they were trying to achieve in this movie. But for me it seemed like it was slapstick and underwhelment, if there is such a word. It was watchable but for me it was humorless. I can understand if a person might enjoy this. Oh well, I've seen it now, so onto the next one.",5,2,6,28 December 2019
The Big Lebowski," Credit where credit is due
","This movie creates its own niche. If I was looking at it objectively through a 2019 lens, cultural brainwashing would suggest this doesn't work. But when I originally saw it, not knowing what it was, I thought to myself, 'ahh, now I understand'. See it.",10,2,3,28 December 2019
12 Angry Men," 12 out of 10
",An oldie but a goodie. People probably acted / reacted like this in those times and it's reassuring to be reminded that there was commonsense and thoughtfulness aplently. The struggle between good and evil; right and wrong; and justice prevails. They don't make 'em like this anymore.,10,0,0,27 December 2019
Knives Out," It's sort of ok ...
","I didn't know what to expect as I'm not a fan of this type of movie. It is entertaining and it has twists and surprises. Sort of reminds me of how Christmas day turns out in real life. The timing of sequences is very good and a few of the actors are really enjoying themselves. They are very professional in their roles. One of them however comes across as artificial in their allotted role and this spoilt things for me. Frankly I was going to rate it much lower than 7 because it isn't my cup of tea and I was just interested to see it to fill some time ... but if you are a fan of this type of thing, I think you will probably really enjoy it.",7,2,3,9 February 2020
The Irishman," ... have become one trick ponies ready for the glue factory ...
","Some very talented actors way past their prime. They didn't know how to cope with the proposed de-aging process so it was a let down. This technology will undoubtedly improve. But it feels like we are being led away from the proverbial goodness of home cooking to more fast food so to speak. The production didn't take any risks so maybe the team who led it are starting to lose their edge. Maybe it's time for reflection or simply retirement. Some of the actors have done better work but age, the obvious use of prescribed antidepressants and a script that is not suited to their best psychopathic acting, is a disappointment.",6,1,6,9 February 2020
127 Hours," Armless movie provides a unique experience
","Boy oh boy. Is this a nail biter to the extreme! He bites his nails so much, he forgets to stop and before you know it, his whole arm disappears. That it is based on a true story is obviously amazing. That someone can actually go through with what he goes through, shows just what a human being is capable of in extreme circumstances. For the uninitiated, one could be forgiven for thinking it is a movie that could be as interesting as watching ants run around, sitting on the back door step. Hang onto your hats and your limbs as this is harrowing and inspirational all in the same breath.",8,0,1,27 December 2019
Alien," Hold onto your guts is an understatement
",Timeless and memorable scenes. Sigourney is stunningly good. Atmospheric and mesmerizing setting. Breathtaking in a way that I rarely feel when I watch more recent movies. Am I hallucinating or is the courage to aspire to greatness disappearing from more recent movie making?,9,1,2,27 December 2019
Life of Pi," Rekindles my sense of wonder
",When I was a boy the movies provided magical experiences. As I grew older my hunger for this disappeared. It has never returned. So I watch Pi and I am reminded that my sense of wonder is still there. Do I miss it? No. But I am glad this movie was made and that I saw it. You owe it to yourself to see it.,9,0,0,28 December 2019
The Godfather: Part II," This is how they improve Godfather Part 1
","They improved Part 1 by making Part 2. As I said about Part 1, just watch Part 2 if you haven't already. This is movie making history that makes modern movies look ordinary.",10,4,5,24 February 2020
Predator," Transparent venetian blinds never looked so good
","Gee, movies were clever back then. I remember seeing this and thinking this is really good. Transparent venetian blinds that's gonna' kill you is such a good idea ... why didn't I think of that? Arnold does what he does best ... big tough hero action guy. Story is good ... these people who put this together are really smart.",9,0,0,28 December 2019
No Country for Old Men," Yeeha pardner; I lurved it
","I don't think I enjoy surprises yet apparently I do. This is one of those movies that proves I don't know what I like until I see it. Movies set in dusty backdrops with men in cowboy hats, driving pick up trucks, is not what I would describe as what I am looking for. But well ... er ... um ... it is, it is! I must admit that I thought the killing device was a spectacularly good touch. I wonder if enjoying this now means my place in Hades is confirmed?",10,2,2,27 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Like a summer breeze that surprises and delights
","I didn't see this coming. This whole movie came around my mind like a summer breeze. An unusual story full of twists and unexpected turns. At times I thought it was going to describe factual events and at other times, I was amazed as a complicated fantasy unfolded before my eyes. In many ways I am glad it went the way it went. There is an expectation with Tarantino movies ... as great as they are and they can be, they can also be predictable in many ways ... many good ways. But this movie is different. Perhaps it is an evolution of maturing of the film maker's thinking. Perhaps it is inspired genius to do the unexpected. It is risky to do this, as so many have expectations that they would require to be filled by QT. By the number of critical reviews here on IMDB for this movie, I suspect there are many who cannot handle change and have misinterpreted it for something else. For me though, the ending was the icing on the cake. In the original factual story, the result was so tragic and repugnant that this effort almost provides a ritual healing. It is not something I asked for but I am glad it happened. p.s. it helped that I didn't know what this movie was about and I didn't read any reviews before I watched it.",9,4,6,2 January 2020
1917," Good but not great
","I sort of enjoyed this ... more or less. Interesting story, good production values and intense at times. I wasn't there but at no stage did I get the impression that this was an accurate representation of what it was like to be there. Maybe there was too much unspoiled green grass, where I had an expectation of seeing a battlefield or bomb craters. The contrast between fighting scenes to surreal peaceful country landscapes continually nagged at me as not to be relied upon. The overall impression I had, was having someone else's idea of humility packaged in such a way, to mask over what I sensed was a compromised movie. Compromised in the sense, that here is a story that might have been profound, were it not for lots of ideas that I suspect were half developed.",6,2,7,29 January 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," Neither love it nor hate it
","I understand why Charlton Heston walked out on the premiere. It's a pretty stupid movie, pretending to be profound. But I did watch it and in some universe I found it enjoyable. Would I watch it again? No, I ticked it off my list.",5,0,1,24 February 2020
La La Land," Watched it for 4 minutes ... what where they thinking?
","Throw together some pretty actors, rely on Hollywood's past musical glories and indulge yourself. Not my cup of tea. Waste not, want not, watch not.",1,3,15,24 February 2020
A Clockwork Orange," I gnashed my zoobies watching this one
","Hey droog, watcha' watching tonight? Many decades after seeing this, I continue to delight in my usage of flip flop Russian. Mounumentally influential and groundbreaking movie.",9,0,0,27 December 2019
Rocky," Watch this before you die
","On so many level, in so many ways, for so many reasons ... just watch it.",10,1,1,24 February 2020
Sicario," It all fits together to make for a fabulous movie
","What makes a movie great? It is that I don't think it's a movie. This feels real. it doesn't moralize, everything appears to be in its correct place and I was disappointed that it ended too soon. I just wanted it to go on and on. I could never tire of this even though I've only seen it once. Meaning that I only like to see a movie once then move on. But I know I could see this again and would still be glued to back of my seat in awe of what is unfolding before me.",9,5,8,27 December 2019
The Godfather: Part III," You have to see this after parts 1 and 2
","In what universe would you not watch this after watching the first 2 movies? It adds context and ties up loose ends. It's a masterwork but I can understand people not feeling this way, as there were preceding movies it had to live up to. And yes",8,1,4,24 February 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Hide your wallet is the moral of this story
","These guys can sell sand to the Arabs. Scorcese, DiCaprio and have you seen the videos of Belfort doing seminars in NZ years later? These guys are masters of their game. The subject matter seems improbable yet it ain't. The whole thing is hilarious and along with Marty's other master works, this is going to always be way up there. There's just so much mischief going on, on so many levels. This is the stuff of fairy tales on steroids ... or cocaine as is the case here.",10,2,3,30 December 2019
12 Strong," Ponies are the new secret weapon of the U.S. military
",I liked it. Heaven knows why but it's worth seeing. Make up your own mind as it's one of those movies that you need to form your own opinion about.,7,4,6,28 December 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Where is the 0/10 option?
","For me this was bad, uninteresting and not worth of my consideration in any serious way. So I don't know if it is the subject matter, the idea of it, or the acting. It has been said that art imitates life. If for a minute I can remotely consider this to be art, then if this movie is supposed to represent some aspect of contemporary life, then I ask myself how things got here? I think this movie was wildly popular, particularly with women. Symbolically then, this disappoints me as I could find nothing endearing about it at all. How is it that this is popular? Am I out of step or does this fantasy appeal to so many in life? Is there anything of a higher order that people can turn to instead? I can't remember if I even bothered to watch it all the way to the end. I think in my mind I am trying to wipe out any interest I have or may have had with this. My understanding is that this movie has been turned into a Franchise. At a time in history when the world is at its most abundant stage, this movie and its offspring represents a different form of poverty.",1,1,2,30 December 2019
Midway," Unusually good; spectacular war scenes
","Thank goodness ... a nearly good old fashioned war movie, with no agenda, other than to try to convey a sense of what happened and when. Amazing that the big name actors were constrained to be secondary to the story. No false heroes to prop up the script. The leads were unknown to me and it seems to me that they suited the feel of the movie. It is an epic movie in some senses ... but it missed the mark in my mind that could see it becoming a classic. For all the special effects and grand scale setting of this movie, I am guessing that the actors are one to two generations too young, to properly capture the essence of who they were portraying. There is a glaring lack of gravitas. The movie tries to pack in so much detail and so many sub-plots, that just aren't properly developed. This also goes for the characters and if it wasn't for what I consider to be reasonably skilful editing, it would seem like I was constantly being robbed, just as I got to know a character. It is a movie that comes across as being done by 'someone' who really wanted to create another 'Lawrence of Arabia' or a 'Gandhi' ... in other words a movie that was profound ... but you know how it is ... when you have too much money and technology at your disposal, it's hard not to be seduced by taking advantage of all the whizz bang toys you can get your hands on. .... but still, I gave it an 8 which means I really enjoyed it and I hope the film makers made a profit with this because in many ways it is a brave movie to make in an environment that is upside down nowadays in the West ...",8,1,1,16 January 2020
Flight," Lifted me up on the wings of flight
","I liked this a lot. Because I'm a Denzel fan and even if I don't like a movie he is in, I still like it. He is one of those actors who has that effect on me. Either I'm a fanboy or he really is a great actor. I suggest he is a great actor. This is a way cool movie and too close to reality for comfort. I mean, don't they screen pilots before they fly full of booze? It seems a bit thin on the ground at times, given the seriousness of the subject matter but upon reflection, the way it ends, suggests this is a super intelligent way of dealing with the subject matter. It is my second favorite movie ever about alcoholism, as one of its central themes. For those who don't care about the subject of too much booze too often, it is just another very good Denzel movie.",8,2,2,30 December 2019
Munich," Bana is the Manna
",Who would have thunk that Bana would do something like this. I remember as a kid watching him in Aussie comedy shows ... next thing he becomes a movie legend ... amazing. This is a bloody good movie re-telling a true story. The whole tragic tale is one of Spielberg's yet again magic moments. He has so many of them.,9,3,3,28 December 2019
Life," I am still waiting for the sci-fi
",I have always loved sci-fi flicks. Whenever I watch them I get the feeling that it's terribly difficult to make a brilliant one. This one has rockets and darkness. That makes it qualify and is also probably the reason I only want to give it a 5. I'm trying to remember the story so that tells me something about this movie.,5,0,2,28 December 2019
Green Book," Black and white equals gold
","Can I begin to imagine how unlikely this buddy, growth, friendship, road trip and most remarkable of personal journeys could have occurred at a time in 60's America? It seems imposseebull ... but that it actually happened is wondrous and magical. It doesn't hurt that the two lead actors are impressively good. Hope and beauty on every curve.",9,1,3,29 December 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Crazy good
","Dazzling action sequences. Great continuity from the first movie. Some of the scenes are hypnotic. There is a pattern in the action sequences, which continues as a production shortcut. That's a bit lazy but as the movie is right up my alley so I can forgive this transgression. I like it's moody and atmospheric tone. Keanu's sense of timing is fantastic.",8,3,3,1 March 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Mad Mel does it again
","I like the fact that Mel developed a formative attitude in Australia, before he made it big time in the U.S. It seems that this secret grounding that Aussies have in their personalities, lingers in his psyche. So this is probably why it allows him to pull a rabbit out of a hat and hit a home run. One minute he gets remembered for running amok and the next minute he is lauded as a genius personified. Mel hits lots of home runs and that should not be underestimated when something has his name attached to it. I have nothing to say about the movie, as lots of others will tell you about it. I just want to add my two cents worth and say that if it is a movie made by Mel, I will watch it. Regardless of the subject matter I am always highly confident that Mel's movies will be good to great to perfect.",9,0,0,30 December 2019
13 Hours," This is a home run
",What a brilliant movie. It does its job without any nonsense. It's like a near perfect gift.,9,2,3,28 December 2019
The Martian," It is very good
","I like it. I know I like it. I want to give it more than a 6. It deserves more than a 6. There is cool Martian landscaping. I like the lead performance. I like what happens. I like sci-fi. I believe it's worth more than the 6 I gave it. Honestly, I'll stick to my 6.",6,0,1,28 December 2019
The Godfather," Perfection and everyone knows it
