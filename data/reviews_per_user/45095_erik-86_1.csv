Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing, Hopeless, Dishonest
","This is a disturbing treatise on hopeless in the vein of 'Dancer In The Dark'.  If you liked one, you'll probably like the other.  As for me, I think that any work of art must have some element of hope in it or there is no point or value in it.  As anti-drug propaganda it might work, but not as art.While Pi came across as pretentious to me, Requiem did not so much. However, I can't believe that this film could possibly be an honest expression of the film-maker.  If it is, then he must, like the film, be completely devoid of hope.  And why would somebody completely devoid of hope make a movie... or do any meaningful work... or continue to live?  If not art, and not propaganda, this film could possibly work as an extravagant suicide note.",Null,0,0,29 December 2000
