Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fantastic...Really!
","I read the novel before I saw the film opening day, so I mostly knew what to expect. I was not disappointed. I've seen it five times now, and between each viewing I think about the flaws it has, but when I see the film again, I remember why I wasn't disappointed. The reason is the same reason I love the original trilogy: great storytelling. Sure, The Phantom Menace has flaws, but as an overall film, it's great. One of the best films to come out in a very long time I think. I just think that some people forget why they like movies: for a good story. Isn't that what Citizen Kane was all about?",9,7,9,23 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," Worth it all for the ending
","I know this has been said many times before, but the ending is really really cool. I didn't see it coming, although I was suspecting something of the sort. My friends all told me how cool the movie was and I finally saw it last night, thinking 'this isn't as good as they said,' until the end came. I think it's necessary to see it at least two times, because I'm sure it's way better the second time (and if you see it, you'll see what I mean). I definitely recommend this one. 9/10",9,0,0,11 September 1999
