The Blair Witch Project," Maybe it was better in the cinema...
","I just saw this on video, so maybe it was better in a cinema with a big screen and surround sound, but...I had no sympathy for the characters. By the middle of the film I was hoping they would not get out of it alive. The initial stages, interviewing the local residents, was reasonably good, but once they got into the woods it went straight down hill.The one good point is that you never actually see anything happen, but Hitchcock and the House on Haunted Hill are much better at that.Scariest movie ever? I don't think so. Prize for characters I'd most like to have seen die horribly? Yes.",3,0,1,4 October 2000
