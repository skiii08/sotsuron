The New World," One of the best Malick films, on a par with Badlands.
","Malick at his best, avoids excesses and turns out a brilliant film. This genre, new world discovery, was made for his style. His visual development of the storyline is exhilarating. 15-year old steals movie. Malick holds both Ferrel and Plummer back. Action, drama, love story are all terrific. He puts you in the wilderness. I loved it most for the constantly innovative techniques and perspectives. England in the 17th century seems very authentic. Malick handles the sweeping themes of culture clashes and interracial love magnificently well. You'll feel like invading a foreign country when your done. He dignifies native Americans without getting preachy or sappy. How will IMDb know when I've written enough for submission. Do they have psychic powers. Or it that I haven't put in 10 periods yet.",10,8,17,20 January 2006
