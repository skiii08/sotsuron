Hereditary," Fear and anxiety inducing
","This has been one of the most well shot, shocking and yet masterful horror movies in a very long time. Wow is just about all I can say. The music, the shots, the horror amazing. The acting was brilliant and heartfelt. You actually get a sense of genuine fear and paranoia felt from the characters. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking it looked cheesy but when I heard someone online say it was good I had to check it out.",9,228,449,8 June 2018
