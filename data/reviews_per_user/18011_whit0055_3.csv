Lucky Number Slevin," Watch the trailer, not the movie
","Thee are a couple of good one-liners in this movie--they are in the trailer, so you can save your $8. For the rest, it's one of the most irritatingly stupid films I've ever seen.The basic problems are: 1) Really, really annoying main character. He gets punched around a good deal in the movie, but he's so snotty that I actually started rooting for the thugs to beat him up after about 20 minutes. The writer probably thought he was adorably brash, and I imagine a few 14-year-old girls will agree, since he does spend a lot of time wearing a towel.2) Insulting the audience's intelligence. Many plot elements are predictable, but instead of supplying the viewer with just enough information to put things together, the movie provides extra hints, followed by tedious explanations from the characters, topped off with a replay of scenes from earlier in the movie, just in case you had nodded off for a critical scene. This is _The Usual Suspects_ remade for people with the attention span of Beavis and Butthead.3) Completely depraved. The ending makes no sense from a human perspective; it only works if you think of characters as automata driven by cheesy genre conventions.",1,17,42,18 May 2006
Fight Club," Ambitious, intriguing, flawed
","In an environment where so many movies seem to have been formulated entirely by the marketing department, a movie that even tries to tell a story and express fairly sophisticated ideas is already above average, even if it doesn't do everything right.'Fight Club' contains some fun social satire, mocking corporate doublespeak and the culture of 'recovery.' It also contains a portrait of a kind of fascism that is quite reminiscent of the followers of Mussolini, with their anti-rationalism and their cult of action and virility. The movie has a sense of humor on occasion, and a central puzzle that keeps the viewer scrambling to put the pieces together.On the other hand, it also glorifies the culture of violence that it purports to critique. The commentary track on the DVD shows that the filmmakers are blind to this: did they ask themselves whether their scathing attack on 'frat boys who take themselves too seriously and shave their heads' was actually presented in such a way as to appeal to said frat boys? Are the endless scenes of men beating each other up necessary to make a point? I quickly started to find them tedious, and began to wonder for whose benefit they were being offered.",7,0,2,1 August 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Classic Love Story
","Surely, despite the Boondocks column in which Grandpa gets a rude shcok, it is not a spoiler to say that this movie is about gay cowboys. But more that most movies with gay characters, it is not about being gay. It's a story of lovers divided by social obstacles, and has a great deal in common with other stories about a woman and a man divided by race or class or family antagonism or whatever.Ang Lee has recovered from the nightmare of _Hulk_ to produce a humane, visually apprealing story. Excellent acting, beautiful scenery, strong dialogue, and a compelling story...unless your taste requires exploding cars, there isn't much more you can ask for from a movie.I notice that a highly unusual number of IMDb 'users' have given this movie a 1. I think that this cannot be because they think that Lee, Ledger, McMurtry et al. have done an incompetent job at the level of, say, Showgirls or Plan 9 From Outer Space. Most of these votes must be from people venting their spite and anger that someone made a movie about this topic--one wonders how many have even seen it. How pathetic is that?",9,7,10,16 January 2006
