Iron Man 3," (Fe)Man 3
","Let me just say that while I am not exactly the biggest and craziest comic book fan in the world, but with recent excellent superhero film releases like TDKR and Avengers, any one(including me) will surely have very high expectations of the film that is Ironman 3. Overall, I have absolutely no complains in the amounts of action involved, with support of animated graphics that is used appropriately, it is probably the more memorable parts of the film. If I were to pick a favourite scene, I'm sure many will agree that the 40+ suits showing up during the fight at the harbour is the best there is. I like how the portray the people injected with Extremis, with lava-looking skin and eyes and all that. All the acting were done without any issues. Of course, the star of the film RDJ as Tony Stark suits him just fine, and Ironman wouldn't be Ironman without him. I should also mention Guy Pearce acting as one of the villains involved in the film, and he did a great job in his role, portraying his intents just the way the general audience will expect him to. Ben Kingsley, being the 'Mandarin' , is heard on the trailer with a sinister and creepy voice, and there is no doubt that he will be the biggest villain that Ironman will ever face, but something perhaps more cruel is yet to come, something that is so flawed it is literally insulting, but later on in this review. Also, the airplane rescue scene was great, it shows Ironman's ability to come in and save those falling people in time.However good the action and acting may be, the main dish of the film still lies with the storyline. Don't get me wrong, I know that superhero films like this attempts to follow as the comic book version in some or more scenes, but there are some flaws that are amazingly obvious! The storyline in this film actually could have been a decent one, but for some reason, they decide not to include some crucial parts which ultimately drags the rating down. My main problem with the film mainly lies with the last 1/2 hour of the film, where every scene in that period stinks worse than my smelliest feces. Let's see, after Killian was defeated by Pepper, suddenly the 'Mandarin' got arrested? Seems legit, considering how the trailer seems so promising that he will be the most terrifying villain is any Ironman film yet.? If Killian is indeed the 'Mandarin' or the main villain, then why bother showing this 'Mandarin' character then? Never mind this, the part when Tony discovers that the 'Mandarin' is really just an actor, it feels like an anti-climax right there. That is the perfect way to NOT reveal a main character that is so featured in the trailer. In fact, whoever who made the trailer should make the film, not Shane Black. Also, if the 'Mandarin' had managed to hack into every single news channel and electronic device, then wouldn't he been able to hack and render Ironman's suit useless? Oh wait, I forgot, there's a mega difference between technology between Tony Stark and the rest of the world. Another problem I have is how fragile the suits are portrayed in the film. For instance, after rescuing the falling people from AF1, Ironman's MK42 suit fell into pieces after knocking into a truck. Right. During the fight at the harbour, Tony frequently changes between suits to get around, which makes me think, are those poor quality suits that they'll break instantly to enemy attacks? Must be the manufacturer to be blamed, tsk tsk. Maya having second thoughts about betraying Tony after he said a few sentences? Right. Plans to quit being Ironman, removes the arc reactor suddenly, curing Pepper of the Extremis? Very legit indeed, plus before the credits, Tony was shown to be towing away a robot, and that he will be back. So what really is the point of extracting the arc reactor now and not 2 films before? Sounds like a familiar ending not unlike TDKR.",6,6,12,26 April 2013
