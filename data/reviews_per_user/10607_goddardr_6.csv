Moneyball," More than baseball
","Moneyball examines a deeper premise than how the 2002 Oakland A's managed to form a contending baseball team with a small payroll. While there is a lot of baseball in the story, it is not the whole story.Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland A's (still is) during a time when it appeared baseball was ruled by large payrolls. Right away, you are shown how the Oakland team loses three big talents to the more well-healed baseball teams (Yankees, Red Soxs) and now they need to find players to stand a chance to compete but at one of the lowest payroll levels in Major League Baseball. Billy discovers Grant (Jonah Hill) who uses a different, more calculated approach to evaluating talent than the old tried and true method of subjective evaluation by long-time scouts.The story is crisp, the movie cleanly presented, and well-acted by the two principle actors. Aaron Sorkin's writing fingerprints are all over it. It is fine movie making.But the story isn't just about baseball, it is about how objective tools are used to decide how the talent is acquired and used. We are seeing more and more of this in our daily lives. If you work for an employer, there is a strong probability that how your efforts are graded are done using a scale that is cold, hard, and unmoving. What was once a series of perceptions and opinions by your boss are now hard straight facts. It is because the humans that manage other humans have a series of preconceived notions of how well you do your job. Humans are fallible, so our evaluations are flawed too.I once created a computer program to play the board game Monopoly with me. I figured that I should be able to beat it more than it beats me because I wouldn't be able to construct a rich set of logic rules that would beat my cognitive abilities. After playing against it many times, I was surprised to find that it could beat me six out of ten games. Reason? I was subject to making decisions based on gut feel instead of cold hard logic and I made faulty decisions. The computer didn't, so it won more times than not.Moneyball is the same thing. A roomful of scouts deciding on which players they should go after is flawed and will ignore those that deserve consideration while accepting those that don't. This is expanding to our workplaces as well and we will be accepted or rejected based on firm data than someone's opinion. As a teacher in a high school, that is exactly what testing has done for schools. It is probably coming soon to a workplace near you.",10,0,1,29 April 2012
Frost_Nixon," Spectacularly done - with a caveat
","Mesmerizing film on the Frost/Nixon interviews that electrified the public after several torturous years with Watergate news articles, hearings, and eventual first resignation of an American president. This movie is a documentary style work involving how the interviews came about and the people involved on the two teams; Frost and his producer, researchers, and girlfriend on one side with Nixon, his staff, and family on the other. It succeeds brilliantly in staying away from mimicry of the two personalities that would otherwise be impossible to convincingly duplicate with impersonation. The viewer is soon pulled away from the sense that actors Sheen (playing Frost) and Langella (playing Nixon) are not the people portrayed, but are intensely credible likenesses.The film starts with a small amount of actual footage running up to the Nixon resignation and then starts to blend in the produced film sequences. The look of the film color is intentionally off-color to give it a mid-70's period film quality (overly bright and warm with some haze). Frost finds out that getting air time (re: financing) for an unpopular ex-president interview is not fruitful. But he boldly continues to stretch for that bit of fame that will take him back in the TV mainstream. Remember, this was a time that TV executives were abhorrent to the notion of paying for interviews. On the other side, Nixon was looking for a way to make a buck, so a good sized check for doing interviews by a lightweight entertainment interviewer was an attractive proposition.The acting and dialog steal the show. Comparing favorably with 'Milk', this film bubbles with timely dialog between the two lead actors. Of course, they had to be spot on in order to make it convincing and emotionally satisfying. The only part of the film I question is one of the moments leading up to the all-important Watergate interview session between Nixon and Frost when Frost is in his hotel suite. I don't want to give this pivotal moment away except that I found out later that this didn't happen. It is a riveting piece of film, but the fact that it was a fictionalized segment hurts the credibility of the film and I feel as if I was managed by the film makers. I think anyone going to see a movie based on fact should have the option of knowing if they can take the information at face value. For instance, almost all movie goers know 'The Da Vinci Code' isn't a credible source of religious teachings, but it is still a fun movie to see as long as one doesn't use it as a basis for fact. Here, it appears almost all of the events are pretty accurate except for this one moment. For this, and this alone, I can only give it an 8 out of 10 versus a 10/10 it would otherwise deserve.'Frost/Nixon' deserves viewing for those who lived the Watergate era and those who didn't. The performances and production are a tremendous plus and the story is particularly pertinent as we are now faced with another questionable presidency for the past eight years showing how a president can choose to impart his will beyond his constitutional powers for the things he believes is right. History repeats itself again.",8,1,2,17 May 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Subtleties Lost in the Confusion
","I love this type of genre where the story, plot, and acting is valued greater than action. If you've read the book or seen the TV mini-series, you'll probably like this at about an 8 level. If you haven't been exposed to the story, it will be a confusing and boring experience.Like the TV series, the emphasis is on limited dialog, plain locations and spaces, and acting space. Some would call it dry, but there is power in the silence as the characters share meaningful looks and furtive glances. If the TV series dialog was measured, the movie dialog was more rationed. I think there were a solid five minutes George Smiley (played by Oldman) said a word after his first screen exposure.The general plot is not that hard to follow, but this is a story based in subtleties. Nuances are difficult to interpret if you don't know where the story is going. Suffice it to say, everything you see is important and sometimes you don't realize the importance until later. Following the high level agents takes attentiveness not usually needed in a wide-release film.Still, I like the style and substance of the movie, even if it is difficult to catch all the meanings of each plot step. Several people nearby me mentioned that while they liked the movie, they were confused about certain events. One told her spouse they needed to pick a simpler movie to watch next time it hurt their brain.",6,0,1,29 January 2012
Django Unchained," Am I missing something???
","The popularity of the movie and seemingly high regard by critics have me wondering why I did not enjoy this movie to the extent I had anticipated. There are so many strange elements, character non sequiturs and inappropriate dialogs that take away from what is a good story and fine set of actors.Here is the short list of issues I have. The music would have been perfect for 'Blazing Saddles'. The hokey lettering for times and places (especially the elongated 'Mississippi'). Some of the scenes purported to be in the deep South obviously came from dry rocky areas of California. The overuse of the sudden zoom shot (like the early scene with DiCaprio). The stupid hooded mask scene before they raid Dr. Schultz' wagon. What it does to the film is to make it look disjointed and out of context a good portion of the time. Plus, plot contrivances appear to make the story end properly. I can't buy the whole Django escape from the crew taking him to the mine.This film is long, and by that I mean long in a way that is not good. I kept wondering when it was going to end. The movie is by no means a good follow up to 'Inglorious Basterds' which was a fine film. The gratuitous violence and gore isn't what hurts the film as much as how the tone is mangled at various points along the way. If you like films, you'll probably want to see it. But don't be surprised if at the end it doesn't satisfy.",4,1,4,20 April 2013
Avatar," Amazing eye-candy
","I can't add much to the story line others have posted regarding the journey of a paraplegic marine to the world of Pandora, but I would like to add to some of the commentary.Nobody is going to watch this movie for the story and acting, both of which were decent, but not ground-breaking. But the visual mastery of James Cameron's work is just so beyond the current level that cinema has been able to produce, it will benchmark a new era achievement much like Star Wars did over 30 years ago. Because you are seeing a story unfold with the full force of state of the art CGI, it makes the story and characters come alive with faultless realism. Creating a race of humanoids such as the Na'vi with amazing consistency, and yet individualistically, it captures the mind, heart, and soul of the viewer as they are enveloped in this strange new world.I saw this at an IMAX theater in 3D and if there was one complaint, I think the 3D system incorporated lacked a little bit of clarity that viewing without glasses would have provided. Is the 3D effect benefits outweigh the detraction in less clarity? This is something worth investigating. I am certainly willing to see the movie again in 2D just because the experience is worth repeating. It is also clear that when the DVD version comes out around May or so if they stick to the release schedule typical of these movies, I'll buy one on the first day and play it on my home theater.",9,1,3,31 December 2009
12 Years a Slave," Painful viewing for no reward
","At this point, I'm tired of movies getting a break because the subject matter is 'important' and 'socially relevant'. I'll concede this is a high quality movie crafted by professionals to produce a haunting effect on those that watch it. I just tire of watching the debasing of people from a horrible period time and time again. I tire of us giving awards to these films because it is a socially correct action. I compare this to 'The Color Purple', another fine movie I refuse to ever watch again. The searing pain of watching people abused washes out any kind of positive movie experience possible. Yes, events like this happened and I can't help the world solve every de-humanizing act or give proper retribution to those that suffered. And I know for a fact that watching it displayed in gripping horror on a large screen is not going to help my coming to terms that I had white ancestors abuse other humans. It seems the success and recognition of these films is just going propagate similar films until we bleed from watching them. How about a film of nothing but beatings? Throw in a little story, but make sure there are copious amounts of footage showing people getting shredded like cooked meat. Will that be enough? Will it ever be enough? No, I don't think so. If you want to watch this kind of movie knowing full well what you will be facing because, let's face it - there are no surprises here, then by all means, watch it. Award it. Keep producing more and more filmography offspring. Because, evidently, there are plenty of people that want to continue wallowing in it. I have no appetite for it any longer.",2,6,11,6 April 2014
