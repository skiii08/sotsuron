Black Swan," A Schizophrenic Dreamcape.
","Black Swan is schizophrenic dreamscape about one girls drive that causes descent to madness. Whether it reflect Kubrickian horror or the visceral style of Aronofsky, all points of direction are tight. Natalie Portman is best role of career and shreds each scene with unbalanced convinction. Fighting and praying for the role of the white/black swan, an already troubled girl embarks of a nightmarish, hallucinogenic journey that ends in her own demise. The role that would make her is the role that kill her. Every moment of this film makes one uncomfortable. From the clipping of her fingernails, to the bitch-slapped circular movements of the camera, to the inability to decipher reality from the imagined. This movie is open to interpretation and will quickly rise to be considered a new-aged modern horror classic.10/10",10,2,4,23 February 2011
Mission: Impossible III," what the hell is rabbit foot?
",the movie makes you feel little. nothing of interest really happens beside action that amounts to very little. but the one thing that ruin the movie for me is never know what is the rabbit foot. it is super weapon that can destroy something or the world. but they never say what it is or what it does. it is stupid. the emotion end of the movie makes you not care at all and the implant in tom cruise's head is never really explained. what does this implant do? why does electricity make it not work anymore? why? why? why? is it a bomb? an electric implant? how does it kill him? i know i rambling but it was annoying. there are leaving things unsaid and then there's bad writing.,4,0,4,26 March 2008
