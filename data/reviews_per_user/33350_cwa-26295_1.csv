Hereditary," 0 stars
","I couldn't agree with another reviewer more when they stated we should be paid to watch this movie. I've spent two hours of my life that I can't get back on absolute mediocrity. This is a horror film that is so bad that it's actually a comedy; the entire theatre laughed at most of the film. I've never wrote a review before, but I was so compelled by how awful this film was that I actually created an account to write one.",Null,8,19,13 June 2018
