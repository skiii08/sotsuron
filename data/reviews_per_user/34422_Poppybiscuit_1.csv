Casablanca," Cringeworthy dialogue and humour - great cinema, embarrassing film.
","Lots to like in terms of defining what a classic film is all about, and there are certainly some memorable quotes but most of the dialogue is so camp and cringeworthy, it is hard not to feel a little embarrassed most of the time. Nobody escapes the terrible script which is saved because I think the writer is trying to make this a comedy or a parody. A bit like Carry on Casablanca might be. I like Rick's response to Ilsa's leading question on the veranda in Paris. Most men would have followed Ilsa's lead and moved to the bedroom after the 'Is that cannon fire or my heart pounding?' But not our manly Rick who replies with his highly interesting knowledge of tanks. The dialogue between Mr and Mrs Leuchtag. What watch - ten watch - such much - is typical of the dribble that is all through this film. I can't write but I know what a cringeworthy script is and this is one. Captain Renault has the highest proportional of bad one-liners though. I think he got his script out of some Christmas crackers. But there are plenty of great lines too so overall it carries itself through along with some great music and plenty of earnest overacting. I like the film - I just can't take it seriously. An 8.7 rating is only because there have been few too many sheep voting - it's great cinema, just not a very good film.",6,4,8,7 March 2013
