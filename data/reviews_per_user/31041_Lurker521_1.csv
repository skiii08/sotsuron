Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great Movie!! If you love nostalgia you will love this!
","Excellent movie that is superior to the first. As I walked out of seeing the first movie, I was jumping around re-enacting scenes with my friend Ed talking about 'Oh when she....' After leaving Kill Bill 2 I was left with a different feeling; one of awe. Quentin as really made a wonderful homage to many of our childhoods with a flare rarely seen. References are abound in this movie that will make you remember instantly to the 'cheap channel' on Sundays and you will instantly remember scenes from the past. Not to say it relies only in the past, there are many innovative concepts but this is truly a movie lover's movie. Get into this, and if possible, line the two movies up to get a feeling right up there with Shawshank or Godfather.",9,0,1,1 October 2005
