10 Cloverfield Lane," Do not watch this movie
","I would love to spoil this so you won't waste your time. I wouldn't read something with spoilers before watching, so I won't. First of all, do not believe any of those high reviews out there, they must be clueless. This film leads the viewer through an interesting story line. The acting is very good. John Goodman is incredible. The first hour or so will keep people on the edge of the seat. Then, out of the blue, everything goes straight to hell. It was as if the writers' child got hold of the script and finished it. The ending completely negates the entire story-line. It leaves the viewer questioning what the entire film even meant (and not in a good way). Some films have twists and turns that will leave the viewer with questions for discussion at the end. This film attempts to do that, but the only discussion to be had, is how this film can be made while so many good films are left in the dust. This film was actually upsetting. Maybe their plan was to make a film that made zero sense, and contradicted itself in the end. If so, congratulations. Also congratulations on forcing me to make my first review on this site. I just had to help warn others. *and if you do decide to watch, do yourself a favor and turn it off before it's too late.**I also had no idea this was some sort of sequel(?) to the movie Cloverfield, so keep that in mind.",1,2,4,14 December 2016
