The Avengers," Good, not great!
","Definitely a GOOD movie, but not great. I kind of expected more of it. But still great fun for the whole family. Action packed, lots of laughter and truly good jokes, good characters, BUT no plot. I've read lots of reviews talking about being great, but to me a great movies demands a great plot, and thats missing. Also, a few things could have been better executed, like the fight between Thor and Iron man and how hulk enters the final battle. Three mains drawbacks that took some credibility away: 1- Iron man can almost kick Thor's ass on a fight, but is trashed by an airship engine???? So the engine can cause more damage tham Thor's hammer??? 2- SHIELD super mega hiper battleship gets boarded and almost destroyed by a couple of terrorists on a helicopter??? If they cant handle 10 guys (from earth), how do they expect the viewer to believe they are earths last defense against aliens??? 3- Thor falls from the sky on a glass cube and is afraid to die? after all we have seen him doing?? ... Anyway. Still recommend because its great entertainment.",7,3,10,1 May 2012
The Expendables 2," Exactly what I expected
","This movie took me back 20 years. Its a complete trip back on the good old action from the 80s and 90s. Its all the first movie could not be. Lots of shooting, lots of unbelievable killings hehe (like the 90s), lots of fights, crashes and everything you expect when you go see a movie that has Arnold, Stallone, Sthatan, Jet li, CHUCK, JCVD, Willis and all the gang. One thing missing on the first one was well taken care: a real villain. Its the kind of movie you don't care about the lies or plot. You just enjoy for what it is: ACTION, action, action. Even with all the bullshit, Im glad they brought back the 90s style. The CGI sucks, and actually I loved that, because it brougth back the times when things were done the hard way, not a bunch of guys in front of a green screen talking to nobody. The short come was Jet li suddenly disappearing half way into the movie, but thats barely noticeable with the introduction of Chuck Noris into the plot. I think if Jet Li was going to leave the set, they could have used that to add some drama, like the bad guys killing him for example, so we would really hate them (instead of killing a character we don't care about). Personally, loved the movie. Got love Arnold and Norris back kicking ass with the big guns and making bad internet jokes hehe.So, it is what it is. A movie not to be taking serious (even the actors make jokes of their former selves) but to be greatly enjoyed by all the viewers how have, or have not, seem this guys in action.",7,1,7,4 September 2012
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Brilliant
","Great movie from start to end. I am trying really hard to understand some of the bad reviews. I guess cultural ignorance has hit globally. The problem is that people either want playstation movies (CGI, period) and just can no longer understand what cinema is (real story telling). The storie is great, the performances amazing, the depth and density of the plot is unreal. Well worth my two hours on a sunday afternoom. You will laugh, cry, be happy, sad... all the emotions in two hours and a lot of angles on todays conflicts. Go check it out.",8,5,11,14 February 2018
Prisoners," Best movie of 2013
","Forget Gravity, 12 year a slave etc etc. This are all good movies, but the best and most underrated movie of the year 2013 is this one. Been a long time since last I watched such a suspense master piece. The acting is tremendous, not only on Jackman's part, but all of the cast did a impressive job. You wont be able to blink for a second, because if you do you will loose something that will make sense a lot later into the movie. The story connects perfectly all the dots. The directing is superb. The ending is perfect. For some viewers the movie might be a little to graphic, but all the violence in the movie makes sense. It's not just for show or to make it controversial or draw attention to a no brainer. Simply put: watch it before the Oscars, because after you may be intoxicated with all the bad taste from the academy.",9,1,2,28 February 2014
