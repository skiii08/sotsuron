Vertigo," A movie that words cant describe!!Mysterious,Love,Death
","I cant believe i saw this movie 2 years ago,when i was 21 and i was shocked i hadnt seen this movie years before,one of the best movies ever made in my mind and many others im sure,i watched it on laserdisc for the first time,remastered and thx added..It was delightful and mysterious,i rented marnie right after that and found that i had beeen missing the movies of alfred hitchcock..A plot that is so true and so mysterious and performances like no other,filming techniques and shots and scenery are just too real..For a movie done over 40 years ago it really still holds some power and beauty of what movies were..If your into lushious dark moody beautiful scores like bernard herrman who also did marnie,psycho,and dont forget his last score TAXI DRIVER,this movie is one to see if you havent already..",10,3,5,18 March 2001
