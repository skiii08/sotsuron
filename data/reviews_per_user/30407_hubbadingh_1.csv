Blade Runner 2049," Thin, self-indulgent, unoriginal, miserable slow pace, vacant, simple.
","Contains Spoilers...I have not been paid or received any gifts or benefits from any organization affiliated with the creation of this Movie. I'm comparing this movie not the original, but to other successful science fiction movies.What excites you, violence against innocents, fist fights, oppression, subservience, naked women, prostitutes, graphic violence without explanation of how it plugs in to the history and story, almost no depictions of how the world arrived at the condition it's in, where evil is allowed to go free, unpunished, if you enjoy a scene carrying on for 3-5 times longer than you are used to... ? then this is the movie for you.This movie is not a vision of one possible future.Greed, power, dominance, violence, dehumanization, destruction already exist...Where is the relief in the movie ? One lone billionaire using their money and power to get what they want unique is scary... no, and yawn.Other successful science fiction movies included joining together in the fight..., men & women from all countries to winning, outsmarting whatever overwhelming evil is threatening our extinction or humanity. Large, powerful, satisfying.A movie where we win, triumph, learn, become stronger, get some hope... and serve a healthy dose of kick-ass to get there has always sold lots of tickets. By the way... more than a tiny bit of humor and an enlightening ending helps. Didn't happen.I usually check who's directing first before deciding on going to see the movie. I was looking forward to fast, decisive, satisfying payback to the villains in the movie... as in 'Sicario'. Sadly missing here.If you are wondering what I'm comparing to... here is an incomplete list below of some of my favorite Science Fiction movies.Alien, Avatar, District 9, Hunger Games, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers - Original, Jumper, Jurassic Park, Mad Max - Original, Matrix, Men In Black, Planet of the Apes - 1968 & Recent Remakes, Predator, The Andromeda Strain, The Blob, The Fly - Original & Remake, The Empire Strikes Back, The Time Machine - 1961, Terminator, Total Recall, Soylent Green, Stargate, Starship Troopers, War Of The Worlds - Original or Remake, Westworld, X-men (All)",2,27,58,7 October 2017
