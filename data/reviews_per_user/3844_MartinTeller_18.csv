","With MOON, Duncan Jones created an interesting sci-fi premise based on some vague, implausible science and used it to explore questions of identity and free will. Here, he does the same thing, but the emphasis is more on the vague, implausible science and less on the character-based struggles. So, when the science starts getting more and more complicated and making less and less sense, it's a problem. I didn't really care how Jake Gyllenhaal was doing these things or what the scientific implications are, except that the movie kept trying to make me care about them. I liked the suspense and action of the first hour, and the more emotional route the film takes in the last part. But all this silly science kept getting in the way, leading to an unsatisfying ending that has little to do with the humanity of the story. I should also note that even though MOON was derivative in a lot of ways, this felt less original to me. It is a mildly enjoyable entertainment, well-crafted and refreshingly brief. But none of it really lingers with me, and the cast is entirely lackluster.",6,0,0,10 January 2012
In Bruges," In Bruges
","A film that reaches for both profound redemption drama and Tarantino-style comic banter and falls short on both accounts. On the comic side, there are maybe a few clever bits but most of it is stuff from the same old bag of gags, with a few homophobic lines thrown in for good measure. It fares slightly better with the drama, although Farrell (who I can't stand looking at... those freak eyebrows and tiny mouth... it's amazing I like THE NEW WORLD as much as I do) doesn't really go through a transformation so much as he keeps shifting back and forth between dickhead and swell guy. We're asked to accept Gleeson as the sage, soulful elder hit-man but even though I liked his performance, the character feels manufactured. Also the ending is possibly the lamest example of dramatic irony I've ever seen. You could almost hear McDonagh quietly and smugly chuckling to himself as he thought of it. The cinematography and score are pretty good, and I really did enjoy Gleeson, but otherwise I didn't dig this very much.",6,0,5,30 December 2011
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in Paris
","This explores similar territory as PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO and ALICE, with a dose of magic realism (or maybe just plain magic) and a look at the unattainability of idealized romanticism. For the most part, the film irritated me. I did like where it ended up, but getting there was not fun. The setup in the first 15 minutes is painful, with everyone sliding into narrow, phony, pre-defined roles. And then we get to the parade of shallow 1920's references. Maybe the point is that Gil's perception of his idols is shallow, but it was still annoying to see Hemingway (and Stein and Picasso and Baker, et cetera et cetera) doing the equivalent of waving his hands around saying 'Look at me, I'm Hemingway!'. Everything is WAY too on-the-nose, in both the modern time and the past. Owen Wilson is vaguely likable as he naturally is (and thankfully not trying to imitate Allen that much), but his character is frankly a drag. McAdams and Sheen come off like straw men, not real human beings in the slightest (sure, we all know people like them, but it's just too simplistic to reduce them to such easy targets). Moreover, I didn't find very much of it funny or even that charming. The whole thing was unsatisfying and disappointing. I think Woody needs to try something radically different.",5,1,2,30 December 2011
Ocean's Thirteen," Ocean's Thirteen (2007)
","Coming off the muddled misstep of OCEAN'S TWELVE, Soderbergh proves that he can still produce high-quality Hollywood fare when he puts his mind to it. Alleviating most of the problems that plagued the second installment, he uses his star power cast much more efficiently, delivers a scheme that's complex without being confusing, and takes a step back from making the characters superhuman. The glitz and style and polish help make this a very entertaining flick, perhaps the best in the series (though I must confess my memories of the first one are fuzzy). My one beef would be that Danny Ocean has it a little too easy this time, and while I enjoyed his easygoing cleverness, I wished for a few more obstacles in his path. Any snags in the plan are deftly overcome, and Al Pacino's character does not make for an intimidating protagonist. Still a very fun ride, though.",8,1,1,12 January 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)
","I was rather surprised and saddened to see that some of the lustre has worn off. Too much of it silly, overwrought, tedious or logically inconsistent. The Nazgul and Uruk-hai that we're constantly being told are the most fearful, awful things ever are laughably ineffective and incompetent. And the less said about Gimli's comic relief, the better. But I won't dwell too much on the negatives. It remains possibly the most impressive production ever, and the very definition of 'epic'. Some of the casting choices are drop-dead perfect, and the characters of Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel and the four hobbits still resonate. The visuals are stunning and there are moments that still produce thrills. Nonetheless, I couldn't help being a bit disappointed that the film didn't enchant the way it did on that midnight screening 10 years ago.",8,1,1,12 January 2012
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
","This is certainly a well-crafted film. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is beautiful, as is Nick Cave's score. Brad Pitt captivates as always, and the other main performances (Casey Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner, Paul Schneider) are all quite accomplished as well. The personalities of James (charming but dangerous) and Ford (hero-worshipping, meek, eager for recognition) make a compelling contrast. The movie engages your attention despite its slow pace, and is a fairly interesting deconstruction of Western mythology. But I had a couple of problems with it. The narration is delivered poorly, and often insults the audience by spelling things out too plainly. More troublesome is the air of self-importance that hangs over everything. Dominik strives for a Malick-ian aesthetic but lacks the emotional and philosophical content to back it up. I tend to appreciate an elegiac tone, but I often wondered what purpose it was serving. It felt overdone to me, as if I was being cajoled into recognizing a profundity that wasn't there. It needed to back off just a bit. I did generally enjoy the experience, however.",7,1,1,30 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise of the Planet of the Apes
","When I was a kid, they'd often do 'Planet of the Apes' week on TV, showing all five of the original movies. I know I watched them all at least once, probably twice, but except for a few of the iconic moments from the first movie, it's all lost in a memory fog (I skipped the Burton remake, and by all accounts, that was a smart move). That's neither here nor there, since this film doesn't seem to do anything to connect itself to the original series, with the exception of the 'damn dirty ape' line (which is horribly shoehorned in, but whatever). I had expectations that the movie would be mostly apes tearing sh*t up, and even kind of hoped for that. But surprisingly, very little of it could be considered an action film. I would say the bulk of it is an interesting spin on the prison movie genre. These are the best parts of the picture (okay, the tearing sh*t up is pretty cool too), watching Caesar's intelligence and rebellion develop. The rest of it is rather meh. James Franco continues his streak of being an entirely uninteresting performer, and the whole bit with John Lithgow's Alzheimer's isn't pulled off very well. Basically, everything not directly involved with Caesar and the other apes is quite obvious, clich√©d, predictable.The CG is oddly inconsistent. The animators seemed to have a tough time with 'young' Caesar, and for the first half hour of the movie he looks like crap. But after that the animation gets pretty damn good, to the point where you forget you're watching CG. I also thought the score was a little overdone at times. In general, though, the film is better than expected yet not as good as I'd hoped for. I'm wavering between 'Fair' and 'Good'... since nothing about it is horrendously bad or anything, I'll give it a leg up.",7,1,2,30 December 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)
","The second film has its own set of problems. It includes some of the most worrisome changes to the original text... I don't get too defensive about Tolkien, but I do hate how Treebeard gets turned into a moron. Gimli's attempts at comedy are still terrible, and let's not forget about Surfin' Legolas and Indestructible Aragorn. However, this one endures better than the first. Switching between the multiple plot threads cuts down on the tedium, and excitement level is way up. You've got the introduction of Gollum as a real character, the development of the Frodo/Sam dynamic, and despite their dumbing down, the Ents are way friggin' cool. The most fun and probably the best-paced part of the trilogy.",9,0,1,12 January 2012
Super 8," Super 8
","In the first 10 minutes, the film actually spells out everything that's wrong with ATTACK THE BLOCK -- you need to care about the characters. It's presented almost like a mission statement. And these are characters I did care about. That is to say, white people. Heh, I'm joking, of course. No, I mean they're kids with personalities and creativity and relatable problems and aspirations. Yes, the film isn't very original. It wears its influences (GOONIES, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, E.T., and so forth) proudly on its sleeve and there's probably nothing here you haven't seen before. I mean, good lord, if I never see another 'shadowy military conspiracy' plot again it'll be too soon. And for fuck's sake, Abrams, lay off the lens flares. It's incredibly distracting once you start noticing it. But the movie is very entertaining, with pacing that rarely feels too sluggish or too fast, engaging action scenes, a pretty good sense of humor, and some skillfully prepared character moments. The cast of kids is quite likable... even the little pyro who irritated me at first eventually won me over. Technically the film is solid, too (except the overdose of lens flares) and I liked the score. Even if a lot of the film was overly familiar, I had a really good time watching it and would see it again.",8,1,1,30 December 2011
3 Idiots," 3 Idiots (2009)
","I really tried to like this. And just to be fair, there are a few entertaining moments, it's professionally produced, and the performances for the most part aren't that bad. Heck, I'll even go so far as to say all the protagonists are pretty good. But good lord, what an awful script. Melodramatic clich√©s galore, terrible humor (why so many pee and fart jokes?), simplistic messages, a hero who can absolutely do no wrong and villains for whom the phrase 'one-dimensional' is generous. It's as if someone marathoned through the absolute worst Hollywood has to offer and took notes. The sad scenes are laughable, the comic scenes are painful, and all of it is predictable (except the final little twist, which I admit was kind of a nifty surprise). Much of the film resembles REAL GENIUS, from the unflappable, infallible hero to the evil professor and the suck-up rival. And that's not a movie you want to aspire to. And there's a scene I know I've seen somewhere else before, but I can't place it. Teacher tells student his exam/paper won't be accepted because it's late, student asks if the teacher knows his name, teacher says no, student stuffs paper/exam in the middle of the stack. It'd be a clever bit, if not for this nagging feeling it was lifted from something else. Even the songs aren't that great, although the accompanying spectacle is sometimes charming. In the end, it's the three leads (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan) and the romantic interest (Kareena Kapoor) and their endearing performances despite the horrible material that save this from being a complete waste. But I certainly wouldn't recommend it.",4,7,19,4 January 2012
Three Colors: Blue," Blue
","I find it very difficult to write about Blue. So much has been said about it already, especially by Annette Insdorf (who provides a superb commentary on the Miramax DVD and a video essay on the new Criterion Blu-Ray), that anything I could put forward would be mere repetition. The truth is that as dense as the film is, it's also quite simple. It doesn't require great effort to decode it, certainly not as much as Veronique. Kieslowski's ideas -- about 'libert√©', grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface. But there is such elegance to its simplicity that it never feels obvious. Only in hindsight does one think 'Of course that's how it should be done' because it is all done so perfectly.",10,0,0,30 December 2011
The Godfather: Part III," The Godfather: Part III (1990)
","This is my third time watching GF3, with about 8-9 years between each viewing. I probably won't watch it again. It's not just that it pales in comparison to the first two movies. Watching it now, completely separated from its predecessors, makes that clear. In fact, for a while I was thinking 'eh, this isn't so bad'. But it really is. Slow and boring, with a complicated web of Vatican blah blah that is too hard to follow, and yet all the major emotional themes are presented in a wretchedly blunt fashion. Everyone pretty much blurts out exactly what they're feeling. I think Eli Wallach and Talia Shire might be the only decent performances in the movie. And speaking of performances... you know where I'm going with this. Sofia Coppola has taken a lot of crap for her role in this film (and Francis for casting her), and deserves every bit of it. She's awful, awful, awful. There are a few lyrical sequences and intriguing elements, but overall it's a dull, muddled, heavy-handed mess.",5,18,26,4 January 2012
The Wrestler," The Wrestler (2008)
","Not a bad character study, but lacks distinction. I thought the theme of people past their prime in their chosen professions (the equally ridiculous worlds of wrestling and stripping) was interesting, especially with the meta-ness of Rourke and Tomei being former stars beyond their glory years, but not developed fully enough. The film hinges on Rourke's performance, which to his credit is excellent. A genuine and relatable portrayal of a character that I probably wouldn't care for in other hands. However, my interest started to wane as the movie wore on, just not quite enough meat on these bones, and nothing too surprising develops. Still, an engaging film with a few nice touches.",7,0,0,10 January 2012
Rango," Rango
","The visuals are off-putting at first (many of the character designs are really unappealing) but do eventually provide some stunning images, particularly when the film goes down slightly surreal paths. And the story is easy enough to tag along with, although it's cobbled together from a variety of familiar sources... mostly Westerns, but oddly enough, CHINATOWN more than anything else. But the problem is that most of the humor is either 'Hey, recognize this reference?' or the usual anthropomorphism. Look, it's animals doing things you've seen people do. I just didn't think it was funny, nor did the film have much heart to it. When it's not being predictable, it's being obnoxious (don't get me started on the potty humor). It RESEMBLES fun -- big, loud action scenes and lots of one-liners and sight gags -- but it doesn't feel fun. It's actually sort of dull. Technologically, and even stylistically, impressive. Otherwise, no thank you.",6,0,1,30 December 2011
Am√©lie," three cheers for Am√©lie
","The truth is the movie doesn't run very deep. I do love it, though, and especially the main character. Amelie Poulain an unstoppable agent of joy, anonymously bringing peace to those around her. But she's always one step removed from human contact -- communicating through pictures, metaphors, trinkets, one-sided phone calls, secret manipulations, windows and spyglasses. She's not exactly shy or anti-social or awkward. In fact, she appears to be quite content with her interior life... until the possibilities for real connection arise, something that both entices her and terrifies her. When she finally gives in, it's a joyous occasion.In typical Jeunet fashion, the film's visual style is jaw-dropping, with a fistful of clever tricks, gorgeous splashes of bright colors, and a dynamic camera that keeps you on your toes. Jeunet uses cinema to enhance the significance of the details, in such a playful and generous manner. Audrey Tatou is charming, but really the entire cast is excellent.A modern masterpiece of wit, whimsy, romance and warmth. A breathtaking celebration of the things in life that are lovely, in ways large and small.",10,3,8,10 January 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2
","Taken on its own, it might be a little too much in terms of 'epic moments' with something seemingly momentous occurring every few minutes. But in conjunction with Part 1, which feels rather uneventful, it probably makes more sense. It seems like a lot of the fat is gone, and from what I can recall of the book, it's edited down nicely into digestible chunks without too much exposition. More importantly, the godawful epilogue is actually transformed into something decent, without that misguided compulsion to tie everything up into neat little bows. Yes, some bits throughout are going to be rather confusing to anyone not familiar with the source material, but they're not really the intended audience anyway. Production values are high, as one would one expect, with massive battles that only occasionally get too busy. I would definitely prefer to watch this back-to-back with Part 1, but that time will come when the inevitable Super Ultra Mega Edition Blu-Ray box set is released.",8,0,1,30 December 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)
","I am a little bummed that this series doesn't thrill me like it used to, especially since it was once one of the few blockbusters of the past 20 years that I truly loved. The level of spectacle in the third installment is impressive indeed... although the Blu-Ray does highlight how dated some of the effects are already (just about any scene where hobbits are composited with full-size humans leaps out at you). And I don't even mind the lengthy coda, and am frankly grateful that the entire 'Scouring of the Shire' episode was excised. It's a great part of the book, but in the film it would have been absurdly anticlimactic, and would have extended an already bloated ending. And this film contains some of the best emotional moments in the series -- even the 'you bow to no one' scene, which could have been painfully corny, works well in context.But one does get a bit weary of watching battle after battle after battle, CGI armies clashing in constant frenzies of murder and dismemberment (speaking of which, I could go into a lengthy tirade here about the insanity of the MPAA ratings board, but I suppose I shouldn't go down that road). Sometimes too much spectacle just makes your eyes gloss over after a while. Oh, and Gimli's one-liners are still a source of annoyance, although thankfully he gets fewer chances to utter them. I'm ranking this as the second best of trilogy... more engaging than FELLOWSHIP, but not as tight as TWO TOWERS. I wonder how I'll feel about these movies in another 10 years.",8,0,1,12 January 2012
Jackie Brown," Jackie Brown (1997)
","This feels like a mellow breather between the sensation of PULP FICTION and the epic KILL BILL. It doesn't really push a lot of boundaries, or crackle with snappy monologue, or provide much tension or action. It's a bit on the slow side and except for the title character, the personalities aren't especially memorable. But it's still a good movie with some style. I hadn't seen it in a long time and had forgotten most of it, so I enjoyed getting wrapped up in the story all over again. Pam Grier is terrific, and although I rarely think about him, I realized that I always like seeing Michael Keaton at work. Maybe this is too 'P.C.' of me (never mind how much I hate that term) but I do feel a little uneasy about how comfortable Tarantino is with the n-word. I don't think having Samuel L. Jackson say it or being a blaxploitation aficionado necessarily makes it okay. I guess I have this image of QT thinking he's being 'real' or 'edgy' or something by sprinkling it so liberally throughout his scripts. But perhaps I'm just projecting. It's a nitpicky complaint, anyway. While the film doesn't reach the dizzying heights of Tarantino firing on all cylinders, it's one I like watching more than RESERVOIR DOGS.",8,1,2,4 January 2012
