The Benchwarmers," I expected less.
","I attended The Benchwarmers yesterday just fresh out of a hot box expecting a movie full of baseballs to the face and lots of 'DERP' humour. For those of you that aren't familiar with 'DERP' humour, it's when in a movie a character gets hit in the head over and over again with something just to get cheap laughs. It can also be associated with Rob Schneider and David Spade movies when they just play some half-assed character for 90 minutes every year. But no, this movie was different.Rob Schneider didn't play the bumbling idiot that we have all grown to hate, instead he played a strong, tough, short guy that has an extremely hot wife that wants to have kids right away. David Spade plays the nerd that thinks he's got a way with the ladies, and the guy from Napoleon Dynamite plays....Napoleon Dynamite, with a helmet on, during the whole freaking movie. Movie had some great long running gags and pranks that made the car ride home an enjoyable one. Of course the movie had kids getting farted on, David Spade getting hit in the head with the ball, Napoleon Dynamite throwing a bat at stuff and the usual elements that make Happy Madison productions pretty useless, but all-in-all it was a decent flick.On the Wal-mart bargain bin scale of $1.99-19.99, I'd pay $6.88 for it, on VHS.",6,0,0,23 June 2006
