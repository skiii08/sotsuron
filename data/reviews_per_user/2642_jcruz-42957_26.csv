The Avengers," The Avengers: 8.8
","The Avengers takes it's time assembling the full team for action, and it pays off tremendously. When the team comes together they have such an ecstatic chemistry with each other. You watch in awe even when they're just talking with each other. Each hero plays off the other so well, and they all have a unique relationship with the other that helps tie the team together. Tony Stark and Captain America clash heads, Tony Stark finds a new friend in Bruce Banner, Bruce Banner has an awkward relationship with Black Widow, and the Hulk has a friendly rivalry with Thor. What helps tie the team together and solidify their authority is the score. One of the best scores in the marvel universe and in film is The Avengers Theme, a classic piece of music that sticks in your head, and it helps you weave an emotional connection to these characters. The Action is some of the best. Although the action is quite entertaining without being too much or too little, some small portions of it feel a little underwhelming, but the rest will give you goosebumps. Watching these characters come together from their separate movies forms quite the spectacle to behold. It gives the movie a monumental atmosphere around the entire experience. Despite that a good chunk of the movie the cinematography can be kind of dull. The dialogue between the team, the action they serve out, and the spectacle of a film that they exist in all comes together to form a memorable movie experience that lasers itself into your brain so you never forget it. Overall, the Avengers is an extremely successful culmination of these heroes that delivers thrills, comedy, and some truly powerful moments that embed themselves in movie history. So I give it an 8.8",8,1,1,25 April 2018
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk: 7.1
","This movie starts off in strong with Bruce Banner in Brazil. The two last scenes in Brazil are two strong points in the film. There's chase that involves Bruce Banner, and a fight between the hulk and some soldiers that is actually kind of scary. After the movie leaves Brazil a chunk of quality leaves the movie as well. Basically the movie can outlined by saying that most of it is kind flat and slightly boring, but is buoyed by an awesome Hulk action scene in each act. The most successful part of this film is definitely the action. While the hulk design is good his CGI when in broad daylight doesn't hold up as well as the CGI in Iron Man. It hasn't aged well, but there's still a good sense of weight to the hulk that matters the most when it comes to making him feel dangerous, which he does. The final fight between The Hulk and Abomination still remains one of the top action sequences in all comic book movies in my opinion. The big and full of destruction with CGI that does hold up well and doesn't take you out of the movie. The Abomination remains one of the top 5 marvel villains. He's mean, powerful, and a menacing threat that succeeds as a villain. The love story between Bruce and Elizabeth Ross doesn't work at all. Liv Tyler is so unbelievably bad in it, and she really brings down the movies overall quality. Ed Norton is fine as Bruce Banner, nor good or bad he just fills the role. Every scene Bruce and Roth share weighs the movie down. Leaving you just waiting for the next action scene to come, which again are great. Overall, The Incredible Hulk succeeds in Action, and the hulk himself, but fails to make the scenes without him engaging, and a love interest who works as a quality vacuum. So I give it a 7.1",7,0,0,19 April 2018
Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me If You Can: 7.8
","For a two hour and twenty minute movie, Catch Me If You Can is surprisingly brisk. Smooth is the word that best describes this clever cat and mouse movie, smooth because of the consistent pace driven by excellently written and performed characters. Watching Frank Abagnale's antics throughout the story is so enjoyable to watch mostly to due DiCaprio's great performance and the rest of the cast, seen through Spielberg's signature dynamic camera. But the only things holding Catch Me If You Can back from being a great movie, is the shallowness of its stakes, and the jazz that is present sproadically through the movie but it needed to be present consistantly. Overall, Catch Me If You Can has fun antics by its eccentric characters, but is held back by the lack of jazz in its smooth step. So I give it a 7.8.",7,0,1,28 April 2019
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3: 5.4
","Iron Man 3 is the worst of the Iron Man trilogy. The narrative has no flow to it making it move along slowly and jaggedly. It makes many attempts to get going but it never picks up speed. Stuttery pacing and underwhelming action bogs the movie down. Robert Downey Jr. does what he can but it isn't enough to make the movie worth seeing. The character arc he follows doesn't seem to work and is less satisfying than his arc in his first two movies and even in The Avengers. Stark is put up in conflict with a villain who fails to make an impact. Driven by bad visual effects, the villain is just another boring antagonist to move the story along. There's only two action sequences that are enjoyable. The rest of the action is just disjointed, and short spurted. At the end of the second act and the beginning of the third act there is a buddy cop aspect between Stark and Rhodey that works great. When that aspect is present the movie actually starts to find its groove, but that groove disintegrates before you know it. Overall, Iron Man 3 lack's that certain eccentric feel that the first two movies did, and the result is an underwhelming and clunky film that should have dedicated more of it's time to being a buddy cop adventure. So I give it a 5.4",5,0,2,25 April 2018
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2: 8.1
","I don't care what people say, I really like Iron Man 2. It's got Robert Downey Jr. doing his thing. It's got Sam Rockwell being a funny and charismatic idiot. It's got more Iron Man suits! It's got action. It's Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow in her prime. It's got more of Jon Faverau's Happy Hogan. It's got Formula one racing! This movie is so much fun! It opens with a wonderful scene reintroducing Tony Stark at a senate hearing. Tony Stark shows why is Iron Man suit is his and why he should have it and does fun doing it. The scene also introduces Don Cheadle as Rhodey, and it's the best recast of all time and no one talks about it! Rhodey's first line in the movie is 'Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it, let's move on.'. And you are never bothered by the recast because of it. Cheadle and Downey have amazing chemistry on scene that is infinitely more rich then with Terrence Howard. Gary Shandling as Senator Stern also shares the senate hearing scene with them, and him and Tony Stark start a nice rivalry that hilariously continues at the end. Tony Stark's story isn't as compelling as in Iron Man one, but this story focuses on Tony's relationship with his father and it's really works emotionally. I thought Micky Rourke did a good job as Ivan Vanko. He does a good Russian accent and has some good memorable lines. 'I want my bird.' For example. Sam Rockwell rivals Downey's charisma on screen and is so fun to watch as Justin Hammer. There's a montage where he's introducing a bunch of weapons to Rhodey, and it is hilariously phenomenal. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow steals every scene she's in and has an incredible action scene herself. And Jon Favearu returns as Happy Hogan and he's more enjoyable to watch then the first time. Iron Man is back with more awesome suits! The best suit in all his movies was introduced during a formula one race and it's the suit case suit. There's only one scene with it and it's incredibly awesome. Overall, Iron Man is a very underrated movie that is a wonderfully fun continuation of the Tony Stark character, even it's doesn't reach the level of quality that the first Iron Man did, it's still a great movie! So I give it a 8.1",8,1,1,19 April 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor: Ragnorok: 7.6
","Thor: Ragnorok did what it needed to do after the first two Thor movies. It had to do something different. The comedy is ramps up the film to a fun wacky adventure. It gives almost every character involved their own comedic moments. The inclusion of Hulk in this movie was an outstanding decision, and he was used in very smart and funny way. Especially when he shrinks down to Bruce Banner and he just acts like kind of a weird guy. The film spends most of it's time on the junk planet Sakaar, and when the story is there it's flows at a good speed and it's very enjoyable, but when the film goes back to Asgard it slows and it's gets boring. You can tell that the director was bored while filming the scenes an Asgard. Most of the scenes on Asgard involved Hela just sitting around most of the time. Hela is played by Cate Blanchett who is a legendary actress, but she's not very good in this. Her attempts for laughs don't get any and she's slightly cringey sometimes. Thor and Hulk/Banner's relationship is one we've never seen between the two before. They're funny but they also give you the sense that they know each other well when they mention the Avengers all the time. One of Thor's relationship I never really enjoyed that much was his relationship between him and Loki. I've liked Loki in the past but he was handled very well in this. He shares heart to heart moments with Thor that really strengthen the depth of unique bond together. The only other fault in the movie besides Asgard and Hela are the squandered potentially powerful moments. There's a great build up to what you think will be an amazing goosebumps inducing moment, but then they're are replaced with just a funny moment, and they are funny and this movie is primarily a comedy, but I think that making those moments more serious would've benefited the film better. Overall, Thor: Ragnorok is hilarious, it has heart, and it's found the Marvel Universe's funniest character in Korg. Even though the fun times on Sakaar are occasionally interrupted by boring scenes on Asgard. So I give it a 7.6",7,1,2,27 April 2018
Ready Player One," Ready Player One: 8.1
","Ready Player One starts off being unimpressive. Partly due to a generically worded monologue by the main character, but over the course of the movie your attention exponentially grows and entwines into the story. The first time seeing the Oasis is a little underwhelming, and the visual effects are jarring, but it grows on you. Seeing Wade's friends inside the Oasis ultimately becomes really fun to watch. The most of the references in this movies are brisk and don't overstay their welcome, but the same cannot be said for other ones. There comes a point in the story where Wade and his gang venture into the Overlook hotel, and it is phenomenal. Definitely the high point in the movie. The final battle is one of surprises and grandness. With interesting new concepts for a battle given that the story to this movie is somewhat unique. The ending as a whole is one of heart touching sights and events that ground the people back to the roots of video games for a moment. Near the end everybody on the Oasis isn't going on these giant complicated adventures. They're just watching Wade play a simple 80's video game. When Ben Mendelsohn opens the door to the van at the end to kill Wade, the kids yell 'Stop! Please!'. It's a moment of self reflection for Ben's character. He turns off his businessman mentality to just look at Wade holding the Easter egg, crying. It's an amazing moment. The cast and their avatars for the most part work. I'd say Mark Rylance had the best performance. He was a unique character and fascinating character, and I appreciated that the world was crying when he died. Ben Mendo did a great job playing an evil businessman, and I loved his avatar. H was funny, and I liked the little twist that he was a girl. Olivia Cooke suited her role well also. Although I didn't like her avatar very much. Lastly Tye Sheridan was fine, but his avatar easily could've been better. One of the things I didn't like about his character Wade in particular was how he fell into that cliché of playing video games with the girl for about 3 days, and allegedly fell in love with her. Which didn't work at any level. Again some of Wade's dialogue is just generically written that underwhelms, and at times exclusive to the first 30 minutes there was times when I felt that I was just watching a cutscene from a video game. Overall, Ready Player One is a fun adventure that easily could've been a train wreck, but with it brings a lot of heart and emotion at the center of the story making it very memorable. Even if some of the attempts at heart didn't work. So I give it an 8.1",7,0,1,12 April 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-man: Homecoming: 8.0
","Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie since 2004. It nails the characterization of Peter Parker and adds a fun John Hughes feel around him. It's a very refreshing experience to finally see Peter Parker as an actual high school student who looks like he's in high school, and not a 28 year old Andrew Garfield. Tom Holland does an amazing job embodying Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Where Tobey Maguire has the best Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield has the best Spider-Man, Tom Holland successfully balances both sides of the character. The opening 30 minutes are fun and exciting, you get to see a montage of Peter just being a friendly neighborhood Spider-man that is hilarious, and shows a really likable character in Peter. This film shows how naive Peter really is. He has tremendous power, but he hasn't honed control over that power. That inherently forms a very well executed Mentor and Student relationship with Tony Stark. Tony Stark is used great in the film by not being too there too little and not being there too much. He's kept a good distance away from Peter so that he's not hovering over him the entire movie. Happy also serves as a hilarious side character to Peter, especially in the beginning. The tone perfectly nails Peter in high school, while the tone is amusing there is still moment of serious consequence for Peter, and he has to answer to Tony for some of them. Although the feel of the high school is spot on the only aspect that didn't as well as it needed to was the love interest. It never seemed to fully click between Peter and Liz. Micheal Keaton as Vulture was a good but not great villain. Some of his motivations seem slightly contradictory, but he's a good character with an interesting connection to Peter, and the Vulture Suit is a heavy slashing piece of sharp metal that look dangerous as hell. The films biggest fault was the overuse of CGI for Spidey's suit. It's a great suit but the film heavily relies on the CGI for moments that don't need it, and it takes you out of the movie as a result. Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming has a fun atmosphere around it with a good characters surrounding Peter Parker. So I give it an 8.0",8,8,12,26 April 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier: 8.4
","Although not as good as the first, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is on the same level as the first. From a Wartime Adventure in the first movie, this sequel jumps to the spy thriller genre. An excellent choice for a modern day Cap film, but it still has a sliver of that Wartime American pride to it. The action is ramped up in this movie to a fast moving, hard hitting punch fest that reminds you just how dangerous Captain America really is. The bar is set high in the beginning, and throughout the film that bar is either reached or passed with every new action sequence. One of the best sequences involves just Nick Fury on his own, and it contains some of the best action in the Marvel Universe. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury has never been more badass. From his action scenes to his awesome one liners this film squeezes all they can out of Nick Fury and it's never worked better. Unlike many other Marvel Movies, The Winter Soldier is a really good and lethal villain. He can go toe to toe with Cap and even make you question if he's better. You get the sense that his metal arm is something to avoid at all costs. The other side villains also earn their part in the film well. What also is very enjoyable to watch is how Steve Rogers lives in this new world, and how he struggles to face the fact that line between good and bad isn't as clear as it used to be. It's a very well done challenge that he has to face. Black Widow is back and she's even more entertaining then she was in The Avengers. Along with Steve her presence is elevated to new levels of lethality, and she's works great as one of Cap's companions. The other companion being The Falcon, who works as a fun new sidekick for Steve Rogers. The film succeeds on every aspect with only few head scratching moments to make the rest of the story work, but those few scenes that lack sense lead to story threads that make up for it entirely. Overall, this cold, hard, and intense spy thriller serves the character of Steve Rogers well, while also giving new levels of depth to returning characters and adding memorable new characters around him. So I give it an 8.4",8,0,0,25 April 2018
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange: 5.3
","This film prides itself on being a mind bending psychedelic adventure, but it never really lives up to that statement. There's mind bending psychedelic scenes which are great, but there's just not enough to make the film that different from a phase one marvel movie. There is not enough magic to break Doctor Strange out of the generic superhero movie mold. The dialogue is sometimes just plain awful, with characters saying words that push the movie down to a bad B-Movie, and misplaced or unfunny comedy is sprinkled throughout the entire film, with the exception of Wong who has some funny scenes. Speaking of laughter, the big bad at the end is laughably bad. Down to his design and how quickly Doctor Strange defeats him he's probably the worst Marvel villain to date. The other villain like Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius is forgettable, but he fits the villain role fine. The third act has a really good unique format to it and contains some good themes, but the execution surrounding it is poor, and it masks the quality of Doctor Strange's good character moments. Overall, Doctor Strange is a movie with a high amount of squandered potential due to it's poor execution, and it fails to exploit what worked in the movie by there being not enough. So I give it a 5.3",5,0,0,26 April 2018
Ant-Man," Ant-Man: 7.3
","Despite having a horrible villain, generic flat cinematography, and physics that don't make any sense at all. Ant-Man is actually a good and fun movie. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang and Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym have some really enjoyable chemistry together that make for a cool mentor and student relationship, but the main relationship that is the film's spine is the relationship between Scott Lang and his daughter. It's a story about a dad who wants to reconnect with his daughter, and it emits a pleasant humbleness to the story. The ants are really enjoyable to watch to their thing and be commanded by Scott Lang, and the 
Ant-Man suit and powers are very well done and make for some fun and satisfying action sequences. The final fight is great mostly due to the fact that it takes place in a little girls bedroom. Which inherently lets in some good comedy that the movie as a whole has as well. It's a consistently comedic movie that has more quick laughs than big ones, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Again the physics don't make sense, but it's forgivable because of the surrounding tone of the story. And the villain is horrible and suffers from the curse of the villain going insane at the end, and the film is shot on some flat and dull cinematography that sometimes makes it feel like a TV commercial. Overall, Ant-Man is a enjoyable light-hearted film that never takes itself too seriously by delivering quickly funny comedy. So I give it a 7.3",7,0,0,26 April 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America: The First Avenger: 9.0
","Captain America: The First Avenger is full of heart, fun, and nostalgic throwbacks to the 1940's that make for an amazing movie experience. Chris Evans was a great casting decision for Steve Rogers. He's an innocent man who's good for the sake of good and he brings an amount of heart to the film that few comic book movies have ever been able to match. Steve Rogers succeeds as a protagonist in every way he can and you empathize with him in a very impactful way. Stanley Tucci's Dr. Erskine highlights Steve's values and solidifies them in your mind and Steve's mind so that you both never forget what he fights for. The tone perfectly captures the spirit of the 1940's, from Captain America's nationwide tour to names like Gilmore Harge, the film has a whimsical vibe to it. The love story between Steve and Peggy Carter is one of the best, and is very heartbreaking. Hayley Atwell brings a likability to Peggy that is exceptionally done. The cast a whole is remarkable. Dominic Cooper fits into Howard Stark as much Robert Downey Jr. to Tony Stark. Sebastian Stan has great chemistry with Chris Evans, giving you a sense that the two of them are great friends from the first time they share a scene together. Hugo Weaving's Red Skull is one of the best marvel villains who poses a great physical threat to the Captain America. He's a very memorable villain. Other performances like Tommy Lee Jones, Toby Jones, and the howling commandos build a great surrounding of characters to watch interact with Steve. The score is the best in the entire marvel universe, enhancing the old wartime tone that makes the movie so great. And the suit... the suit that he wears into battle is great. It's a good blend of the comic version and a war suit. But the best suit and by far my favorite Cap suit is the suit he wears when he tours the country selling war bonds. The old fashioned outfit looks so cool in the context in the movie. I'd love if he wore that suit in all his movies. Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger is an amazing and heartfelt wartime adventure with memorable characters and powerful moments that induce thrilling goosebumps. So I give it a 9.0",9,0,1,19 April 2018
Dunkirk," Dunkirk: 9.0
","One of the criticisms of Dunkirk is that it is devoid of emotion or characters, and I'd have to disagree with those criticisms. Dunkirk is a fast paced experiential movie that delivers action, suspense, and emotion. In terms of characters and character development it was basic, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The movie focuses on the characters as much as it can without losing the full thrill experience. The actors playing the characters like Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Barry Keoghan, and Kenneth Branagh put in very moving performances across the board. All with their own character arcs that all induce different forms of tears. Barry Keoghan's George inducing the most. The score is very heart-beating and immerses you into the movie experience like a head being pushed in water. The clock ticking puts a layer of suspense under the entire film that prohibits you from being taken out of the story, and the Shepard tones increase that suspense indefinitely. The music is one of the biggest strengths in the film, but at the cost of being too loud in some dialogue scenes. Causing characters words to be drowned out. When it comes to narrative it's brilliantly structured to produce almost a funneling effect. Over the course of the story this funneling effect slowly increases intensity to the max. Until the very end when the effect turns in reverse to allow for a very epic and powerful ending. Overall, Dunkirk is a speedy thrill ride told in a unique manner, and it's speed doesn't take away from some exceptional moving moments. So I give it a 9.0",9,1,3,18 April 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War: 7.9
","Civil War's conflict is unforgivingly intense to a point where you get scared that the two opposing Avengers are willing to kill each other. With seemingly too many characters to handle in one movie, Civil War masterfully juggles all of them while also still putting the spotlight on Captain America. Who's fight in this story keeps exponentially elevating to greater conflict, with Tony Stark being on the other end of that conflict. This is the most outstanding character that Tony Stark has had since the first Iron Man. The tension between Cap and Stark grows into a brutal and intense final fight that doesn't pull it's punches. The action as a whole is efficiently well executed. The final fight being the only great action sequence, and the least good action scene is the airport fight. It does it's job, but it's slightly underwhelming and probably should've been better for such an important scene with so many characters. The stand outs among the two teams of Avengers are Black Panther, Vision, and Spider-Man. Black Panther being a sleek and effective killer who's out a hunt for revenge, and at the end has great character development himself. Vision is very enjoyable to watch struggle integrating with the world and trying to figure out how social encounters work. And Spider-Man is so refreshing to watch be part of this movie. He's funny and in way over his head that brings a sometimes need level of excitement and levity to the scenes he's in. Even though his CGI is too much and doesn't always work. Other of the aspects of the film that don't work are some of the green screen effects which are very distracting during some emotional beats. A Villain who's plan is very fragile and who's motivations are rather boring. And a sometimes contrived plot that forces you to make some stretches in order for it to make sense. Overall, Civil War is a very exciting battle between lovable heroes that corners you into not knowing who's side you should be on that makes for some extremely tight tension. Even if that's at the cost of having dome far fetched plot points. So I give it a 7.9",7,1,2,26 April 2018
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford: 9.5
","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is not only one of my favorite movie titles of all time. It is also one of my favorite movies of all time. 12th favorite to be exact. It's moved by an amazingly adapted script that nails the characterization of Jesse James just as much as the book does. While also keeping the dialogue that compels you to ponder, and contemplate. The beautiful music has a rhythm to it that parallels the rhythm of the story. The pacing of the movie is slow, but never drags. Giving you room to closely inspect the movie without missing a thing. A triple threat of cloud shots suggest time passing, and also gives room to breathe while giving you something pretty to look at. The cinematography has a cold dampness do it which emotes the same feeling as the music does, and seamlessly blending these aspects of the film into something unforgettable. A sort of breezy gloominess that sets a perfect tone. Also perfect is the plethora of characters and the cast that are elevated by the dynamic camera shots and movements that act as another character all together. Brad Pitt plays the infamous outlaw Jesse James. Watching him on screen ponder about his own morals and sanity is perplexingly magnetic. The lore around Jesse James himself makes you consider the possibility that Jesse was an omniscient being. A mysterious omniscient being who is slowly losing knowledge about himself. Hinting at the possibility that may he have gone and lost his mind. Casey Affleck portrays Robert Ford. An awkward and naive young man who idolized Jesse James to such an extent that when he met the real Jesse he eventually grew resentful of him. Ford's character arc highlights themes of expectations vs. reality. Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford, Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, and Sam Shepard as Frank James are standouts amongst standout performances. Which this movie has a high number of. Each character is as memorable and unique as the last. Each character hypnotizes themselves into your mind causing you to think about them for a long period of time. Overall, this film is a masterfully crafted tale of media, myths, legends, and expectations that effortlessly paces through it's long but necessary runtime, and presents you with quintessential shots that tell a unique story within themselves, before giving you a conclusion that stains your mind with melancholy. So I give it a 9.5",10,2,4,14 April 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers: Infinity War: 8.8
","Everything has been leading up to this. Infinity War's biggest challenge was somehow juggling dozens of characters coherently without making the entire narrative spread out too far, and it succeeded. Every character gets a respectable amount of screen time that they deserve without any of them feeling like cameos or out of place. From Spider-Man to Black Panther each hero's intro is just as exciting as the last with each intro bringing the hero's own flavor into the movie, and this helps the film feel like the absolutely giant event that it is. It has an unbelievable amount of stakes and is probably the most serious of all Marvel movies. There's harrowing parts to the film that are small and big, but Thanos must've had a hand in writing the script because the amount of dramatic and comedic moments is perfectly balanced. The movie is far from short on good laughs. There's plenty of laugh out loud moments that don't seep into other parts of movie and ruin some powerful serious moments, which Marvel movies have struggled with in the past. And the powerful moments are POWERFUL. They range from happiness, excitement, sorrow, shock, and sadness. They hit you so hard that after the movie it's as if you're suffering from shellshock. 
 Thanos as a villain is phenomenal. Down to his motivations and his CGI he felt like a real person, and not just a one dimensional evil for the sake of evil villain. He's driven, he's dangerous, and interesting. This is Thanos's story, this is his movie. His unique power set given to him by the infinity gauntlet is used as well it can be used. One of the inherent problems with a villain who can basically do anything is that makes you ask 'Why doesn't he do that every time?'. The film deals with that very admirably to the point where that question is actually answered... most of the time. And Thanos's Black Order are quite dangerous themselves. They feel so lethal that you consider that they can each best multiple Avengers in combat single handedly. Despite the intense saturation of characters and villain who can do anything, the film is actually quite well written in the sense that there is no bad, cringy, or overdone lines. Which is hard to avoid in a big movie that is half the time spent in space. The narrative itself is executed exceptionally. It's really well structured. It feels like one continuous story and not a jumbled mess. It almost feels like it's told in chapters similarly to Pulp Fiction, at least in the first half. Like many of the other characters, the original Avengers Theme(which is a character in itself) also makes an epic return throughout the film. Enhancing the intensity of the story's biggest moments, while evoking goosebumps, nostalgia, and even tears. 
 When it comes to the films faults they're little and minor. There's a few laughs that are indeed funny but are drawn out a little too long, causing the joke to overstay it's welcome. And during the second act the movie drags a little, but it only might do so because of the great anticipation of how the film will end, and that anticipation may compel you to grow a little impatient. But it's not fully a fault in the film itself. There's some actions that the ability of being able to perform those actions are muddled or left unexplained, maybe I might've missed the explanations, but it took me out of the movie slightly when it came up. What didn't take me out of the movie was the CGI. One of the main problems with Black Panther was the overuse of CGI in the film, but T'Challa's suit is a nice real looking practical suit that looks great. Again Thanos's visual effects are some of the best ever, and never did the thought of green screen or brief rubbery replacements of characters cross my mind. Overall, the colossal event of Infinity War successfully handles a large plethora of characters while leaving more than enough room for exhilaration, emotion, and consequence that is abundantly present in this film much more than the films that came before it. So I give it an 8.8",8,11,34,28 April 2018
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place: 8.7
","A Quiet Place is a movie with few words, but it's loud. As the silence goes on it slingshots the volume of every creak and scratch in the movie upwards. All thanks to the genius premise. In today's horror movies monsters have become kind of dull. The simple change in senses to the monsters in A Quiet Place makes them a lingering omnipresence that stays with you the entire movie. No matter what scene you're watching you are tyrannically and desperately trying to control the sounds each character makes. No matter what emotion you feel or thought that you think, the monsters presence is always there. The opening of the movie introduces you to the next hour and twenty minutes that you'll have to experience, and it summarizes the entire experience of the movie in itself. That's what a good opening should do. Every sound heard in this movie finds it's way to the panic button in your brain. Even the slightest sounds hit you with a sliver of anxiety. The dynamic duo of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt elevate your desire to see their family survive, more so than if anyone else were in the Father and Mother roles. They are fantastic. The Father's relationship with his daughter is what drives the story, and the problems with their relationship are solved in a very emotive way. The Monsters design was very unsettling, it gives you the same sensations as eating food that doesn't sit in your stomach right. These creatures stick in your head even after the ending of the first movie you watch after watching A Quiet Place. The movie achieves the getting to it's spectacular ending without falling into the trap that Horror movies fall into. That being the trap of everybody in the story being a complete idiot only the story can move along. It successfully steers clear of even giving you thought of idiocy. The only trap this movie occasionally falls into is the few cliche jump-scare and fake-outs that every horror movie seems to have now. Also there's only one hiccup of logic that is unbelievable, and may take you out of the movie for a moment. Overall, A Quiet Place is a brisk Horror/Thriller that pushes all of the fear buttons, but doesn't tire you out by overstaying it's welcome, thanks to it's perfect runtime. So I give it an 8.7",7,2,4,12 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Call Me By Your Name: 9.4
","In this portrait of first love, you are first introduced to Northern Italy in the summer of 1983. A place within a matter of minutes, you find yourself suddenly wanting to vacation there. The way the film is shot is definitely one of the main reasons for thinking so. In every scene, you feel the exact temperature, the breeze from outside through the window, how cold the pool water is, you feel the sunlight hit your skin, and going out in the cool night air. The cinematography masterfully uses warm and cold colors that exaggerates these feelings. Entire scenes are one shot, but not in an ostentatious way. They are done subtlety with simple and faint camera movements. The only way to notice these shots are if you're on the look out for them, if not they swift passed you. The quality of the cinematography is duplicated when it comes to the music. The piano music gives an elegance to what transpires on screen, other times it's used to provoke tears. Three Songs by Sufjan Stevens add they're own emotions and themes to their given scenes. The themes being absence, happiness, and melancholy. The same themes are also conveyed through the words of the characters. The beautifully written script gives the characters words that chisel in your mind, and make your heart feel enlightened. These words are impeccably acted by a cast that is inviting to watch. Timothee Chalamet portrays Elio as an awkward cool kid. Two characteristics that usually contradict each other, but when they're embedded in a character like Elio, they feel like a new characteristic entirely. Chalamet conducts an attractive character to watch live his life, even when he's doing something dull like reading. Micheal Stuhlbarg plays Mr. Perlman, Elio's dad. He's a character that you forget to appreciate until near the end, when you notice how important he is to the story. And how he tells Elio advice about life and love that warms your heart, but also makes it feel heavier. Oliver is embodied through Armie Hammer. He slowly weaves an intimate connection to Elio, at the same time he starts to gel into a member of the family. Overall, this movie leaves you with the seeds of the characters planted inside of you, allowing you to learn something from each of them. While doing so it tells the story of the characters in a stylistic and beautiful manner. So I give it a 9.4, which makes it 18th in my top 50 movies of all time.",9,1,4,10 April 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the Galaxy: 8.2
","Guardians of the Galaxy probably should've been a bad movie. With characters that no one knew or cared about, and two of them being a tree and a talking raccoon this was a big risk for Marvel. Fortunately it's one of Marvel's best movies. It starts of with a protagonist and soundtrack that perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Peter Quill/Star-Lord played by Chris Pratt sets a good balance between drama and comedy in his performance. A balance that is present in the rest of the movie as well. The talking raccoon named Rocket voiced by Bradley Cooper is surprisingly one of the best characters. He's crude, funny, and is a believable character, thanks to his hinted at past and great CGI. Gamora portrayed by Zoe Saldana is a good teammate and a faint love interest for Quill. She's dangerous and being the daughter of Thanos makes investigating her untouched backstory with Thanos immensely interesting. Dave Bautista puts in a good performance as Drax. While his level of acting ability is sometimes visible his performance is saved by his hilariously quirky comedy. And Groot voiced by Vin Diesel is what ties the team together with his innocent heart and relationship with Rocket that elevates the quality of both of their characters. The Guardians are accented by an actually good musical theme. Which is rare in most marvel movies. Most of the action succeeds to be creative and thrilling. Although some action takes detours into generically fighting boring henchmen. The henchmen are leaded by an underwhelming villain in Ronin. Who fails to impress and is stuck being a cheesy evil for the sake of evil antagonist. Overall, The Guardians make this movie a fun space adventure with great comedy, characters, and emotion that embraces the films pleasurable tone, and Ronin's boringness makes a feeble attempt to tarnish the Guardians story, but ultimately he fails and the movie prospers. So I give it an 8.2",8,2,3,24 April 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers: Age of Ultron: 6.2
","Being a disappointing sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron isn't all that bad. It's character interaction is good but not as good as the first, and it's characters themselves are mostly successful, but it's enough to fully buoy itself out of it's bad villain, forgettable action, and familiar plot points. The only character interaction that didn't work at all was the evolved relationship between Bruce Banner and Black Widow. When they talk to each other you're only eating for them to stop instead of listening to what they have to hear. Everyone else works good even though what they say isn't as memorable as in the first Avengers, but what is one of the only memorable things in the film is Hawkeye, who plays a very important part in the story. He also builds good relationships with the two new twins Wanda and Quicksilver, and grounds the rest of the heroes near the middle of the film. Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver are fun new additions to the team who each have an effective power that doesn't go unneeded. The new addition who works the most is Vision, who is an intriguing android who may even be more powerful than the Avengers themselves. The movie is polarizing in the sense that the opening is poorly done and the third act is the strongest point. It definitely gets better as is goes on. The final fight lacks in good action but is rich in good character moments and some slightly moving moments. Through the rest of the film between the underwhelming action are spurts of good action that is cut off before it can make an impact. Which sort of summarizes a lot of the movie as a whole. The story touches upon some cool concepts, but doesn't to explore them enough. Which is also again summarized with Ultron. A villain who has a cool concept behind him, but is squandered due to his laughable facial design, his occasionally child like personality, and his seemingly conveniently inconsistent ability power levels. Overall, Age of Ultron is a big step down from the first, and it's strengths desperately climb out of it's weaknesses to be considered an okay movie. So I give it a 6.2",6,0,2,25 April 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2: 8.2
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 starts with an absolutely laugh out hilarious opening credit scene with baby groot. It's great to see the team back together and having fun. Their banter and chemistry is still very strong. The comedy is even funnier than the first and is loaded with some big laughs. Primarily dished out by Drax, Mantis, Rocket, and Baby Groot. Baby Groot is used brilliantly in this story, and every second he's on screen are the best parts. The new addition to the team is Mantis, who is an outstanding side character to see interact with the team but mostly interact with Drax. Rocket and his CGI continue to be phenomenal, and he builds a new interesting relationship with Yondu. The heart from the first movie is present in this one, and the quality of the first soundtrack is duplicated in this as well. The two come together to softly complement one another near the end of the story. The film finds a good villain in Peter Quill's father Ego. He himself is a good character and villain even though his plan at the end is rather dumb, but there's still stakes. Gamora's behavior in this makes her a little unlikable. She spends most of the film just being angry, which makes her presence kind of unfun. Overall, this sequel is right on par with the first, and has a better villain and comedy than the first. Even though the first has better team chemistry and story. So I give it an 8.2",7,0,0,27 April 2018
Thor," Thor: 6.5
","The First Thor is very uneven interns of quality, and it acts as an okay continuation of the Marvel Universe. It being uneven due to the fact that every scene that takes place on Asgard just slows the movie down and is slightly boring. With the exception being Heimdal who's a great character. When the movie is at it's best Thor is depowered on earth. The scenes on earth are smartly funny and are interrupted by uninteresting scenes on Asgard. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor really well and delivers some good comedy that the movie should've capitalized on more. The rest of the cast is just fine. There's not much to be said about their performances. In terms of action there's only one good action scene. It involves Thor trying to get his hammer back from Shield, and its very well done. You get the sense that even without powers Thor is still a tough opponent. The rest of the action is just generic and fails to exhilarate. With the Final Act being the clearest example of that. Overall, Thor is an okay movie with exceptional comedy that makes it worth seeing. So I give it a 6.5",6,1,2,19 April 2018
Black Panther," Black Panther 7.1
","The first fifteen minutes of this movie is a bit of a mess, giving you information that would've been more impactful to learn later in the story. After that fifteen minutes you are introduced to Wakanda, which was ruined by off beat and distracting music. The music switched from generic cheesiness, that didn't fit the movie, to a sort of rap music that fit really well in some scenes, but they didn't feel like they were in the same movie. The music played out the same way the action sequences did. Most of the action felt choppy and failed to impress, with one fight between T'Challa and Killmonger being great. It was as if inside the passable action were flashes of greater action scenes that could've been something else. In the same scenes opposing the flashes of greatness, were flashes of rubbery and pixely CGI, that took you out of the scene momentarily. This is all present especially during the final fight. Which looks like it was conceived after a double feature of Tron: Legacy and The Phantom Menace. What it fails to do on an action movie approach, it makes up for in characters and story... With the exception of one thin character played by Daniel Kuluuya. T'Challa is a stoic protagonist, who basically has the same character arc as Thor in Thor: Ragnorok, but he works fine, just like the rest of his family. The only place this movie greatly succeeds in, is the villains. Killmonger and Klaue are a refreshing duo of menace and menacing comedy that doesn't ruin the tension like in other Marvel movies. Ulysses Klaue is funny and has a very unsettling puffy robot hand which is an interesting little tool. Killmonger is a tank with a new compelling background and motivation that continues to impress, up until his very last lines, which are great. He rips through every level of Wakanda seemingly effortlessly, which makes him probably the most badass villain in the marvel universe, even though his endgame is bit overdone. Him and T'Challa are caught in a feud for the throne of Wakanda that develops an interesting story, that comes with a few surprises and twists. Although it does go on for a bit too long. Overall, I liked this movie. It's not great nor is it bad. It's successes beat out it's failures just enough to make it an enjoyable movie. So I give it a 7.1",7,0,1,12 April 2018
Iron Man," Iron Man: 8.5
","Iron Man is up there with The Dark Knight, The Avengers, and Superman:The Movie as one of the most influential comic book movies of all time. The movie starts of with a great opening scene that sets up the character of Tony Stark perfectly. In the opening you get a sense of just how funny and charismatic he is. Robert Downey Jr. makes Tony Stark a classic hero with a very interesting character arc. The Iron Man suit is perfect, and seeing him build it is so satisfying to watch. The design is perfect because it not too bulky and not too light. It has a sleekness to it that also looks dangerous, and you get the sense that it has some real weight to it. The CGI holds up great even after 10 years, it's so well done that theres no scenes in the movie where it's clearly all CGI. Only scenes that look practical or a mix of practical and CGI. The Cast surrounding Tony Stark is goof. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper is a fun character to watch interact with Tony Stark, and Jeff Bridges who does a good job playing the villain who goes crazy at the end for no reason. That being one of the only flaws in the movie. Terrence Howard is fine as Rhodey, I think Don Cheadle makes the character more likable. Sound track is full of awesome rock music that adds a layer of excitement to the film as a whole. Overall, Iron Man is great movie that kicked off a great cinematic universe. It's fun, exciting, and rewatchable. So I give it an 8.5",8,0,0,19 April 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Thor: The Dark World: 3.1
","Thor: The Dark World is the worst of the marvel movies. It lacks any significance or stakes to be an impactful movie adventure. Asgard continues to slow down the movie to a painful crawl, and again fails to be an interesting place. Seeing Thor walk around on earth wasn't fun like in the first Thor movie. The entire story just feels too flat and by the numbers to be any level of engaging. With a villain who makes you question if you have amnesia because he's so forgettable. The final battle fails to have stakes, like at all, which makes just as unimpressive as a conversation at a dinner table. The actors did the best with what they were given, with the exception of Anthony Hopkins who you could easily tell was bored. There was the occasional comedic moments that actually most of worked well, that being the only positive of the movie. Overall, this film's story moves along but fails to compel you to move along with it, due to it feeling like an automated bore. It's nearly unwatchable. So I give it a 3.1",3,0,2,19 April 2018
Annihilation," Annihilation: 6.3
","After the success of Ex Machina, Alex Garland has seemed to have let that success go to his head in 'Annihilation'. This movie is pretentious yet original, smart yet dumb, well made yet poorly made, and riveting yet boring. It's an inconsistent mix of those things from start to finish. The first half of this movie is a slow burn, the only thing that gets you past it is the anticipation of what will come in the end, which the movie builds on very well. The mutations that occur in the shimmer are mostly creepy, some make you scratch your head, but watching this plethora of mutations unfold, ranges from haunting to paranoid to peaceful. The music is sort of like the mutations. Merging two things that don't go together, the blend of sci-fi vibrations and country music help outline one of the themes of the movie which is putting two things that don't go together, to create something new. It works great, unlike the love story between Natalie Portman and Oscar Issacs characters that the movie hinges on. Whenever it flashes back to them in bed it makes you wanna go back to the shimmer, those scenes never payed off. I do give credit to the last thirty minutes of the movie, for giving me something that I've never seen in a movie before, but just because it's original doesn't necessarily mean that it's good. It's not even bad either. The ending just felt like it was concept with nothing behind it. It felt hollow. Overall, watching this movie is neither a good experience or a bad experience... just an experience. So I give it a 6.3",6,1,2,12 April 2018
