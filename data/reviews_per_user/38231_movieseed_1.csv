Raiders of the Lost Ark," Still Love this movie!
","Indiana Jones is still an enduring and timeless classic in every way a great film should be. I can watch this movie when I'm a graying, senile 90 years old grandmother and still LOVE IT! The story, acting, suspense, adventure, thrills, chills and everything in between is universal and timeless. It doesn't get better than this combo of Lucas, Ford and Spielberg!Some of the photography, pacing and ending Special Effects is dated a bit, but I think Ford's charisma, charm and ruggedness still holds up with age. He's still so dreamy I'm still in love ;) Worth a rewatch if you haven't seen it in years like me!",8,2,4,2 July 2014
