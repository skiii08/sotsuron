Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Does the Star Wars series justice as an opener to the epic.
",Well a lot of crude was flying around about this movie before it opened. Also a lot of people let it sway their judgement on it too. I found it very suiting for the start of the series. I don't want to get into the whole it was made for kids argument because I enjoyed it and I am only a kid at heart. It's true the effects are over powering but really they are needed for a movie of this caliber to drive points across. Now as for people commenting on bad acting well the acting was no worse then the original trilogy so snap out of it. I think George Lucas did a great job. This is of course my humble opinion and I welcome yours.,10,0,0,27 May 1999
