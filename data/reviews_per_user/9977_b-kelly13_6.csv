Casablanca," Too complicated
","'Casablanca' is definitely a movie that I would need to watch more than once. Each scene is so jam packed with information about either the love story between Rick and Ilsa, or the café, or the Nazis. Each scene is very busy with so many people; your eyes do not know where to look first. It is almost as if it is too many stories in one film. All the the sets of the film were rather beautiful. In the city of Casablanca there are stone sidewalks, and dim lights. Ricks Café and the Blue Parrot are just two of the many 'cool' places to be in Casablanca. The characters also fit in well with the story. Although I did not care much for Ilsa. This is because it always seemed as though she wanted to 'have her cake and eat it too.' She was married to a caring and loyal man, and she decides to cheat on him with the mysterious Rick. For this reason I very much so enjoy the ending when Rick forces Ilsa to go on the plane with her husband. We expected the opposite out of such a suave love story. For being known as a 'classic' I truthfully expected more out of this film.",3,4,13,20 October 2010
Citizen Kane," 'What is Rosebud!'
","'What is Rosebud?' This is the question we are asking ourselves throughout the film. Charles Kane is a mysterious and controlling character who just wants more, more, more!! This leads everyone to believe that Rosebud is a material item, when it really relates to his family and his childhood. The ending was perfect. It was unexpected, and you were left guessing until the very end. I would recommend this film to anyone. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat.I particularly enjoyed the effects of the filming. I like how the camera would fade in and out or would film a scene down at foot level and then look up. It seemed very modern for its day. All of the characters were also perfect at their roles. This story just seemed like a more realistic love story compared to others of its time. It dealt with divorce, cheating, and many others wrongs in marriage. He was scarred from childhood, made the best of his life, and he still wasn't happy.",10,0,1,20 October 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A new kind of western!
","I am not one who enjoys western movies at all. Watching 'Stagecoach' i nearly fell asleep! This film was surprisingly different. Rather than all the tough, cold action from normal westerns, Butch and Sundance added much humor to the film. It was a film where you are actually on the bad guys side because their characters are so likable! I enjoyed how Butch, played by Paul Newman, and Sundance, played by Robert Redford were such a dynamic duo! The script was very well written. Most western films have very cheesy lines, and an unnatural tone, but this film worked just perfectly. The dry humor was such a nice touch.It was interesting to see how quickly after the Hays Code had ended that there was nudity in films in the late sixties. For example when Butch's girlfriend undresses in front of him. This type of material never would have been allowed even ten years prior.",7,0,1,17 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Impressive, but Longggggg
","'The Grapes of Wrath' is a very powerful movie indeed. This film shows the truth of the Great Depression and what people really went through. The living conditions at all of the camps were for the most part unbearable. Rarely would there be running water or edible food. The effects of this movie were pretty realistic. Such as when Tom gets hit in the face, the makeup looks as though he was actually hit in the face.This movie was just too long for my taste. I feel as though a good portion of it could have been taken out, and we still would have received the message of the film. To me it did not make sense why Tom would be a former prisoner, and then in trouble with the cops. I feel as though all of that could have been left out because it took away from the actual point of the film, which was the Joad family going to California for work.",5,0,2,13 October 2010
The Graduate," A New Film For the Time
","This film was a new kind of film for it's time. For one it showed things which never would have been shown before such as nudity, dry humor, and a love affair. I enjoyed the scene when the main character Banjamin is under water in his scuba suit and all you can hear is the sound of him breathing into the air tank. I feel as though this is a metaphor for how he really feels with his life. For one, he just graduated from college and his parents are expecting great things from him. This puts a lot of pressure on him because he does not know exactly what he wants to do. I feel as though it represents how he feels he has no where to turn, and he is just drowning in his own life. I liked how this film showed the consequences for infidelity. It is also a very romantic love story, seeing as how Benjamin will do anything to prove to Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine how much he loves her. It is interesting to see how the affair between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson turns out, and what happens between Ben and Elaine.",9,1,2,17 December 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicholson is always good at what he does!!
","Jack Nicholson truly did an amazing job in the making of this film. Although he is a man from prison just trying to get out of work duty by coming to a mental institution, you are still on his side the whole time. He befriended all of the patients and saw them as people not patients. He formed a clan with them. He helped shine the light on how tragic and terrifying the staff of hospitals and such places can truly be. Although she was such a horrifying character, Nurse Ratched, was very well played. You couldn't help but just hate her!! I liked that this movie showed that any sort of patient is still a person. It was good to see that even a criminal can have a heart and befriend them, even when he could talk his way out of prison. A MUST see film!",9,1,2,17 December 2010
