Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Possibly the greatest animated movie of all time.
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is definitely a classic. It was the first movie to be a complete mix of live-action and animation, and it did it perfectly. Anyway, the story of the movie is: Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) takes pictures of Roger Rabbit's wife Jessica playing patty-cake with another man. Roger is very sad to find this out, and the very next day, Marvin Acme, the man Jessica played patty-cake with, is murdered, and the cartoon rabbit is framed for the crime. Everyone is after Roger, including the evil, 'toon-hating Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd).This movie was not only one of the most original movies at the time, it was also one of the best. It perfectly blends live-action with animation, the plot is very good and original, the voice acting and the live acting is great, and the movie is very funny. When I was little I loved this movie, and now that I'm older, I probably love it even more than I did. Partly because I now understand all of the adult humor in the movie, and because I can now truly appreciate how this movie was so revolutionary, and original for 1988.Another great thing about this movie is how many different cartoon characters from different studios are all seen on the same screen. Like on the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are seeing dueling pianos, or when Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny are actually seen together talking when Eddie is falling, or on the ending when we see many different cartoon characters together including Bambi, Pinocchio, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Woody Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and many others.Well, I'd say 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is one of the top 5 greatest animated movies ever, and I'd say it is the best movie of the '80s, and it's easily the best live-action / animation hybrid of all time. I love everything about this movie. It truly is a masterpiece. It's funny, original, clever, and just plain awesome. Not only is it great to see so many classic cartoon characters in one movie, but even this movie's own characters like Roger, Jessica, and Baby Herman are great. I love this movie.Rating: 10/10 'Amazing'",10,0,0,14 June 2011
Shrek the Third," Very disappointing. The first two movies were great, but this one wasn't very good at all.
","I loved the first two films in the 'Shrek' series. They were funny, had amazing animation, an all-star voice cast, good characters, and great stories. This 2007 third installment was a HUGE disappointment. The plot of the movie is: Fiona's father is dying, he wants Shrek to be the new king of Far Far Away, but Shrek just isn't fit for that kind of job, so him, Donkey and Puss in Boots set off to find the next heir, Fiona's cousin Artie. But when their ship sails away Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant.Now this is a good plot, but it all feels very forced. Donkey's lines aren't as funny or memorable, and some parts of the movie are honestly very boring. Now that doesn't mean the movie is horrible. The animation is as great as it always was, Shrek's dream about babies was very funny, as I've already mentioned I like the premise of the film, and Merlin was hilarious and almost saves the film. This movie isn't bad, but it isn't good either. One of DreamWork's Animation's weaker movies, but at least it's better than 'Bee Movie' and 'Shark Tale'. To me 'Shrek the Third' felt like a direct-to-video movie. It's just not very good, which is really sad to say, because the first two were excellent films. 'Shrek the Third' is mildly entertaining, but not a movie I like to watch very often.Rating: 5/10 'Average'",5,2,3,20 May 2011
Space Jam," A movie-length commercial and nothing more.
","'Space Jam' is an animation/live-action hybrid starring NBA superstar Michael Jordan and the greatest cartoon characters of all time, the Looney Tunes.The plot of the movie is: Mister Swackhammer wants a new attraction for his alien theme park 'Moron Mountain'. He chooses the Looney Tunes, and sends his minions the nerdlucks to earth so they can capture them. The nerdlucks change into giant monsters and kick the Looney Tunes's butts in basketball, so Bugs Bunny and the gang find Michael Jordan to help them.Due to Michael Jordan's HUGE popularity in the '90s, there was obviously a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it came out back in 1996, but just because it has big names doesn't mean it's a good movie, and that is the case with 'Space Jam'. This movie is pretty much an insult to Looney Tunes and the Looney Tunes fans. For one thing this movie introduces Lola Bunny. A pointless character whose only purpose in the franchise is to give Bugs a love interest. Also instead of the physical comedy and battles of wits that made these characters famous, we get overly violent, crude and mean-spirited humor.Other flaws include Jordan's uninspired and overall boring acting performance, the obnoxious and irritating characters that are the nerdlucks, and for the film being just a giant advertisement for Michael Jordan and all of his sponsors.The only good things about this movie are the animation and the voice acting, which are both outstanding, and there a few mildly funny jokes here and there, but overall this movie sucks.Not recommended for hard-core Looney Tunes fans, or people who have been exposed to some actually well made animated movies. If you want to see a good animation/live-action hybrid film, just watch 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' instead, or this film's sequel 'Looney Tunes: Back in Action'. This movie is just bland and one-dimensional.Rating: 3/10 'Bad'",3,3,8,24 September 2011
