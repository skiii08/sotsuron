Ford v Ferrari," Exceeded all expectations
",#FORDvsFERRARI exceeded all expectations. Amazing performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Great screenplay by James Mangold. I don't know how else to describe the experience other than it being perfect. Another movie on my very short list of (5/5Scales),10,2,5,17 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Do not miss the post-credits, motherflurkens!
","@Marvel scores another one with #CaptainMarvel Great origin story with great casts, great cat, and it ties back to the Avengers and Phase 1 movies! Great dogfights ala Top Gun. Great 90s throwbacks and grunge music! Do not miss the post-credits, motherflurkens! (4/5Scales)",8,1,2,9 March 2019
Aquaman," MCU amalgam. Good but hardly original.
","#Aquaman is another superhero flick squeezing too much story in 3 hours. Obvious MCU-'inspired' scenes, like MCU amalgam. Trident duels were really well done albeit 'familiar', and Italy battle was tastefully brutal. Overall, good but hardly original (3/5Scales)",6,0,1,23 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It was a mess!
","I'm shocked that @jjabrams could screw up a @starwars movie. Bad plots, pacing, characters out of character, retcons, dead, alive, dead. It was a mess! Now only Rogue One & the original trilogies are worth canon. BRING BACK THE BOOKS! #StarWarsTheRiseofSkywalker (1.5/5Scales)",3,1,1,20 December 2019
Toy Story 4," A companion tale for Woody as he struggles to move on and finds his place in the world without Andy
",#ToyStory4 felt like a companion tale for Woody as he struggles to move on and finds his place in the world without Andy. No. 3 was a better send off overall for the franchise. I don't think there should be a No. 5. Fantastic storytelling and animation nevertheless. (4/5Scales),8,0,4,30 June 2019
The Lion King," Amazing level of detail!
","I knew every scene and every song by heart. I knew the differences vs the original down to the exact frames, exact words. The animation was so lifelike, almost alive, like watching a live documentary! Amazing level of detail! #TheLionKing (4/5Scales)",8,3,10,30 July 2019
Joker," Gripping, tragic but unrealistic
","#Joker tries to justify the birth of a psycho mass murderer on political corruption, economic disparity & societal collapse but it only does so by highlighting the worst of humanity. It's gripping, tragic but unrealistic, devoid of empathy & hope. A sequel would suck (4/5Scales)",8,1,6,28 October 2019
