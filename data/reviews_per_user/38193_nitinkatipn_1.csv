10 Cloverfield Lane," Boring and Cliché
","Movie Rating like this on IMDb makes it really difficult to trust which is a good movie and which is not. Seriously 7.1 rating for such a mediocre silly movie. There is really nothing interesting going on in this movie, 100 other such movie have been created and flopped over the year. A old man, kidnapping a young girl and acting all weird and crazy scary is so cliché. There is no suspense in the movie and its so predictable than one can predict the end after 10 minutes into the movie. I am highly disappointed, with the plot. The ending is so stupid, one can laugh. they saved all of that of the last 15 minutes, and suddenly a creep movie becomes a alien movie.",5,2,4,10 February 2017
