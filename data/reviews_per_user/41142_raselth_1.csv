The King's Speech," A Wonderful Film
","I went to cinema expecting a real heart-felt movie and I was not disappointed. The director has really adapted the happenings of King George VI and presented it in a interesting way.Colin Firth was magnificent in his leading roll and Helena Boham-Carter, Geoffry Rush and Micheal Gambon were all very convincing in their rolls. In a few places it did seem a little slow but this not really affect the movie at all.The thing that really captured me about the movie was the face that a commoner had the nerve to treat the king like any man. This fact was accentuated by how I met a women half an hour after the movie who said her brother had been treated by Lynel (please excuse my spelling) and did the exact same bet with a shilling.In all an inspiring and thoroughly enjoyable movie which definitely deserves best picture at this years Oscars.",9,0,1,4 January 2011
