Arrival," Angry with 2016 garbage message movies
","Now, this is supposed to be a deep and meaningful movie for us humans. This is supposed to teach us people.. life and connection/communication between us. You know what? I am really angry right now and not because of this masochistic movie( i'll explain this later) but, because of the huge amount of public acceptance this film has gotten. I challenge each one of you that find this movie thought-provoking(in a positive way) and motivational to oppose the facts that my mind conceived. And which are those? First of all, this woman and only her acquires somehow the power to see through time. Now, as i understand aliens are granting this power to her. But why? Is this a tool she needs to understand humanity better, or to find her purpose? I really don't get it. Even if this is true, i mean, that this ability helps her, how does it help the audience, us, to build an emotion for our life purpose. What i find, is a masochistic way of thinking, where i know the pain and i am feeling it but i embrace it because i want to live it for real. The last sentence mirrors the protagonist's choice, to accept the future that she already knows is painful and not only for her. But, even if someone says that everyone know the pains and sorrows of life but still we wanna live, then i'd say OK, but why is this some kind of a gift. Seeing the future and accepting it doesn't make me any better. I don't feel better, i just feel bounded to something, imprisoned. This is lack of freedom and it doesn't motivate me to live. Moreover, in one of the positive reviews of the movie that i read at screenrant.com, the author claims that what i previously described as masochistic is freedom of choice. He says that the protagonist knows what's gonna happen to her daughter and to her but she is able to choose either she wants it or not. And i have to ask you, dear author, in what category we put the protagonist if she chooses not to give life to her daughter. It is not freedom, this is just fake freedom because it is pushing you to become either a 'murderer'(even if not a true murderer you have to live with this burden for ever) or a masochist(i explained that before). To be quite frank the decision she took in the movie, the masochistic one, is the worst and most selfish, because apart from everything else it shows that she doesn't even care about her husband's and daughter's will and opinion, so free will for her and no will for the others. Because of these, i don't see how this ability can be a gift for a human and moreover how can this hypothetical scenario can help us, as humanity, to truly love our lives and others' rather than being selfish deep thinkers who want to live their lives. As for the second part of the meaning 'Arrival' is endowed with, which is peace and connection between people, i have to say that it is as shallow as shallowness or simply dumb. Why? Because of the reason that people come together in this movie, which is for no reason. But, please, explain me the reason that they and us, the audience, must feel connected and in peace. Is it because the protagonist in the movie tells china president, or something, the last words of his wife? Even if this is enough to bring people together in the movie, it is not in real life, so please 'sci-fi industry' either deliver us more obvious and definite messages or just stay on star wars....",4,12,22,24 February 2017
