Ford v Ferrari," Americanised racing completely misses the point
","Typically if you show me a decent trailer involving actors of the calibre of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, I will be at least interested in seeing more. Couple that with a film that appeared to stay faithful to racing's core principles and sparsely use CGI for stunts, I was then invested in seeing where this depiction of Le Mans '66 would end up going. My doubts, regretfully, were reinforced roughly halfway through the film: the plot had devolved, the characters inconsequential, and the on-screen action boiled down to a clunky contest between the 'God-driven, hard-working' Ford company and their lazily-stereotyped adversaries at Ferrari.Carroll Shelby (Damon), an ex-racer now mechanic/expert on the national circuit is recruited by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) to begin work on a racing outfit under the name of Ford. Interestingly, Bernthal (a highly regarded actor in his own right) was painted in the trailers as a key figure in this film - however, he is marginalised almost instantly, making the final product appear recut since shooting finished. Shelby recommends the British driver Ken Miles (Bale), a notoriously difficult but brilliant driver to race under Ford at Le Mans. However, a comically minor incident between Miles and Chief Exec Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) begins the most out-of-proportion grudge between the two, constantly trying to screw the company over for absolutely no founded reason other than they rubbed the wrong way.This is the plot for the next 2 hours, interspersed with ugly stereotypes of either the English (through Miles and his family) or the Italians (portrayed as evil, scheming foreigners working under Enzo Ferrari's orders). This further ruins the realism of the entire film - am I really supposed to believe that the conglomerate that is Ford Motors is really the altruist in a story about the authenticity of racing? Further to this - isn't it beyond indolent to completely omit Miles' driving partners (Bruce McLaren and Denny Hulme) in a film about a race requiring two drivers throughout? The narrative constantly eludes that 'only Ken Miles is good enough to drive this race', and yet he is constantly partnered with someone who must have been as good to maintain their success.The driving is almost secondary to the glaring errors throughout the film, but it does provide some relief from the cringeworthy American narrative. The cars do look authentic and rough; the clothing matches the era, and the design of the film on the most part is clean and period-accurate. This shouldn't really come as a surprise given the profile and budget of the film, and almost makes the real issue (something I wasn't focussed on but that my father did point out) even more glaring: the driving makes no sense. Miles will be 'visualising' his perfect lap, smooth changes and steady racing, and then come race-day, will slam the gears in and yank the steering wheel round corners like nobody in an endurance race ever would. This, to me, is a killer to a film reliant on accuracy - you cannot expect the audience to respect your work if you yourselves cannot stay faithful to the source material.I wanted to like this film. I am still waiting for a film based on cars or planes to really blow me away. Dunkirk mad me sure that this sort of cinema can be done well, but they need both a director who breathes the topic, as well as a production company willing to take the financial risk to fully commit to creating this sort of feature.",5,6,13,19 December 2019
Moneyball," A film showing science's place in sports
","Moneyball is a slow-paced but intricate true sports biopic, highlighting Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt) exploitation of a gap in baseball by utilising statistical analyses above all else. This film makes the little dramas more meaningful, building character development whilst remaining faithful to the source story. The message is ultimately portraying the unlikeliness of financially vulnerable teams making it anywhere in competitions today, but also gives insight into one of the true underdogs in sports history.A consistent soundtrack adds pathos to the more meaningful scenes, not relying on dramatic plot twists to propel the story, and helped by accurately reconstructed scenes from baseball history. Brad Pitt is strong in his role, and this film also features Chris Pratt and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The standout, however, is clearly Jonah Hill: his innocent voice and quiet intelligence perfectly depict the revolutionary thinking of a modern genius.Family matters and intra-team disputes take a back seat in Moneyball, but the true story background allows this to not become meandering, making this film a worthwhile watch, particularly for sporting fans.",7,0,0,8 March 2019
War Dogs," Teller and Hill showing talent beyond their years
","Without the lead duo, War Dogs wouldn't be much more than an unusual tale dressed up for the big screen; fortunately, the casting is immaculate. Before seeing this, I would have placed Miles Teller (Whiplash, Fantastic Four) in the category of my least favourite actors (a mixture of public persona and previous films), but he has obviously matured since his earlier performances into an actor with quality range. However, Jonah Hill (Superbad, Wolf of Wall Street) is the unleashed personality of the film - a brash personality with expensive taste and an iconic laugh like no other.The storyline follows the leads trying to pave their way into the international arms industry, moving from small-fry deals to bidding on the biggest international contracts. David (Teller) tries to juggle work alongside his pregnant and strongly anti-war girlfriend, whilst Efraim (Hill) drags him deeper into the murky waters of war. The dark horse for me is Bradley Cooper's Henry - a brilliant portrayal of a man who has already crossed ethical lines trying to make money, giving the duo a glimpse of what their futures could end up being.Oddly enough, the soundtrack is one of the most refined cinema has had in years: every track selection captures the scene perfectly, no mean feat given the potential for nearly any scene to morph from comedic to gravely serious. The accompanying scenes of both over-the-top brashness and flaunting of wealth across the globe perfectly captures the public image of arms dealers, making War Dogs an enjoyable romp through the lives of those living off war's inevitability.",7,0,1,11 June 2019
Friday Night Lights," A far more finished product than you would believe
","I saw the television show of the same name around five years ago, and remember loving it: a genuine, down-to-earth production on rural football, featuring big names like Kyle Chandler, Connie Britton and Jesse Plemons. This big-screen version might not have the same starpower (although does feature Billy Bob Thornton), but I actually think that's for the better: this film is simple, it's real, and it tells a story well. Frankly, Hollywood could use some more of this to cut through the swathes of overproduced rubbish being pumped out weekly.The story is pretty linear - a high school football team in Texas trying to win a championship. They are a good team, but winning is never easy. Based on H.G. Bissinger's book, the stark realities of a depressed town buoyed by football are probably more real than you'd like to believe; it is even sadder to think that for these players, those final seasons probably did mark the highpoint of many of their lives. The team is full of unusual characters, starting with the boisterous running back Booby Miles (Derek Luke), but helmed by the reserved quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black). Ultimately, they are all friends, but the bright lights of football sometimes muddle the mind.By the end of the film, it doesn't really matter whether they won or lost, who played well or failed to perform. You watch because the characters convince you how much sports means to them, especially considering a lot don't have much to strive for after their season ends. The story doesn't rely on a leading man to have a great performance; they are a team, and this is one of the only sports films I've seen that really seems to understand what that means.",7,2,3,19 January 2020
Rocketman," Aaron Egerton doing his best to drag Rocketman out from mediocrity
","It's a shame that Bohemian Rhapsody came out only a year ago - a highly-acclaimed biopic of an openly gay music icon struggling against personal demons and the people around himself. Rocketman's story is a carbon copy, carving out the same niche that Rami Malek had already filled, to the detriment of this production. Bad luck is not the only culprit for this movie falling flat, however: a lack of cohesion really damages the flow of the film, and musical numbers aren't enough to bring it back from the edge of averageness.Rocket man can't seem to quite decide whether it is a biopic of one man's life, or is truly a 'musical' in the true sense of the word. Launching into song doesn't quite work in this format, as it tries to maintain historical accuracy whilst conversely using songs that didn't exist during the time period of a particular scene. Another issue arises with the diluting of the quality of some songs: for example, the titular musical number (and arguably the most well-known song featured) is, in part, sung by both a child and in an A cappella style. Some may find this endearing and more emotive, but I feel these genres of films should try to stick closely to the originals to enhance the nostalgia the target audience will feel.Credit where credit's due, Taron Egerton (Elton John) does a quality job delivering his role's highs and lows, always walking the line of sanity; Richard Madden (John Reid) is also strong as Elton's suave future manager. The rest of the cast are unfortunately stuck with misguided scriptwriting, making any other performances far more difficult. The one that I found most irksome was the dynamic between Elton and his family - Rocketman couldn't seem to decide how to portray his relationship with his mother (Dallas Bryce Howard), as their feelings seemed to swing from mutual resentment to being one another's only comforts. By the end of the film, nothing is really worth remembering but Egerton's performance and Elton's songs.",5,3,7,11 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper's bravest work
","A Star Is Born is more than your simple musical romance: it is a nuanced, real and truly heartfelt piece of cinema, one that Bradley Cooper obviously invested some serious time into (having directed and led the cast). Following country star Jack's (Cooper) chance meeting with Ally (Lady Gaga) and their succeeding relationship, the abusive powers of drugs, alcohol and fame are all laid bare. There are more than a few personal touches to each scene. Cooper's addictive personality, something he's battled with in his own life, has a haunting reality to it - something only possible from someone who has suffered such hell themselves.Further to this, Lady Gaga is a revelation; a lifetime in show-business has helped her develop both an appreciation and a contempt for the public, but it's more her awareness of Jack's struggles that make Ally such a believable character. Sam Elliott (the original Stranger from the Big Lebowski) is also a transformed man, showing more emotion than he is usually allowed to display. The authenticity of this film is furthered by the devotion to the image of country music. Filming at venues such as Coachella (where Gaga had headlined that year) gave authentic atmospheres to scenes, and smaller gigs towards the beginning of the film look believable.Gaga convinced Cooper that singing live would be preferable for the film's image, so neither lip-synced, and both comfortably hold their own on stage. The most powerful scene (an argument between Ally and Jack in the bathroom) felt beyond genuine, making a serious case for my favourite scene this year. Hopefully Cooper gives directing some attention - more work like this could make him a serious cinema powerhouse in the near future.",8,1,1,19 August 2019
Captain Marvel," The beginning of Marvel's downfall
","It says a lot about a blockbuster film when your best actor is a CGI cat. Captain Marvel is your stereotypical, run-of-the-mill superhero flick without any of the humour usually seen in the genre. A tired cast plod through the obvious and clunky script, forcing quips and one-liners throughout that don't really make any sense. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers) is the primary culprit; whilst its not entirely her fault (directing will have forced a lot of creative decision on her), I feel a more suited actress could have done the part slightly more justice. Jude Law (Yon-Rogg) also seemed out of his depth, whilst Samuel L Jackson (Nick Fury) had unfortunately signed on for the long haul.Marvel do their best to shoe-horn in every potential Top Gun reference and callback to previous films; this can be a refreshing sight for the more avid fan, but the sheer numerousness of in-jokes and references to other movies makes it a chore having to remember them all. Overall, this film feels purely like a stop gap to fill in any potholes still existing in the Marvel universe - where the Tesseract came from, how everyone will survive the Avengers finale, and why Fury is missing an eye.However, arguably the most irksome problem is the film's reluctance to either make Captain Marvel the all-powerful being she's been made out to be, or just an average fighter struggling against mediocre enemies. One minute Larson's character is being holdback by civilians on a train, and the next she's flying headfirst through a spaceship, destroying everything she touches... As Marvel's answer to Thanos goes, this all feels like a get-out-of-jail-free card that nobody wanted, nor asked for.",4,29,47,28 March 2019
Us," A novel approach to horror, but too much left unsolved
","I like that Jordan Peele has been trying to think outside the box with his latest releases: Get Out was a decent flick, and I am excited to watch his reimagining of The Twilight Zone. Us stays true to this theme, exploring the duality of people through the Wilsons' 'evil halves'. Visually, this film is excellent, representing both 1980s and the present day strongly. Moreover, the use of colour (primarily red) and set design allows this film to smoothly work across different environments without feeling forced. Easter eggs and hidden clues are featured throughout if you look hard enough, which is an enticing proposition for the more hardcore film fan.In terms of acting, the strong cast is brilliantly headlined by Lupita Nyong'o, who is perfect as both the cautious mother and estranged doppelganger. Credit must also be given to Elizabeth Moss, who demonstrates more of her range than most fans will be accustomed to (a very different tone to The Handmaid's Tale). Nyong'o plays the only truly serious role, with most others being utilised more comedically. The score for the film allows serious tension to build in some of the scenes - 'I Got Five On It' is the key tune, used both in lighthearted and menacing scenarios to keep a constant flow to the film. Similar techniques have been used successfully in other movies, and to great effect here as well.The only real drawback for me is the lack of clarity the viewer is left with after the credits roll. I respect that Peele spent more time on the story than on the scares - this simple but often overlooked point explains why the horror genre is oversaturated but underwhelming. However, too much is left to the spectator to decide... (without spoiling anything, rabbits?). Some may find this freedom to interpret beneficial, but I would prefer conclusion so as to make a proper judgement on the film's core principles, without being clouded by other mitigating factors.Overall, Us is a fine addition to the horror genre, breathing new life into a category cluttered with the same plots and tropes: Peele seems to do no wrong at the moment, and I will be eager to watch anything he directs in the near future.",7,2,2,3 April 2019
Spotlight," Serious acting for an equally serious topic
","Spotlight is a dark insight into the secrets of the Catholic church in the USA, and does not hold back on any punches. The revelations uncovered throughout the film (and the actions of the church following) are like something fictional, making the topic even more startling. By experiencing it from the viewpoint of the media, it becomes even more apparent the lengths to which some senior members of the church went to avoid publicity - as well as the influence religion still has on modern-day society.Strong casting helps to emphasise the story: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams (among others) all portray their characters brilliantly, hailing them as the heroes that uncovered the priest scandal of the early 2000s. Spotlight is not an easy watch, but navigates a difficult plot well by giving a glimpse of justice; however, even after watching, you will be left with an uneasy feeling that is hard to shake.",8,1,1,20 April 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," Overplayed, inaccurate and ridiculous - an instant hit
","You know what you're getting with a film like The Day After Tomorrow: after Earth enters an instant Ice Age 'loosely based on climate change' through an unanticipated global storm (you read that correctly), one paleoclimatologist attempts to traverse the US to try and find his son. Weather-related events then ensue across the world, ranging from gangs of tornadoes tearing up cities to feral wolf packs roaming New York (you read that correctly as well).Strangely, the cast for this story takes fewer liberties than the storyline: Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid feature as the father-son duo and are the main focus of the film. However, you would be forgiven for forgetting their involvement in the movie, given the scale of events unfolding. The CGI'd environmental events just about passed the test at the time upon release, but given the 15-year gap since then, some of the larger catastrophes look slightly worse for wear (see 'Statue of Liberty survives 93m high tsunami' for details). Realistically, there's not much more to see here than random events and a few misplaced romance scenes.It is important not to take this film seriously in any way, otherwise you risk becoming part of the demographic that hates this film for precisely the wrong reasons. The Day After Tomorrow is good because its bad - its merit is through forcing the most ridiculous environmental catastrophes all into one film, under the impression that everyone is at risk. Some people (worryingly so) use this film as an example not to ignore global warming; whilst their intentions are true, I don't really think this can be classed as a piece of literary merit.",6,3,5,5 June 2019
Deadpool 2," If you liked the first you'll enjoy the second
","Essentially, Deadpool is a lot like Marmite - you either love it or hate it. I am not a lover, but I can appreciate why people enjoy the franchise so much. Deadpool 2 is full of the same sort of jokes, 4th wall breaks and decent action scenes as the first; both films are also fairly low on actual storyline, so don't go into this wanting a satisfactory ending.At the end of the day, Deadpool 2 is what it says on the tin - you probably don't need a review to tell you if you'd enjoy the film, but regardless, it's a decent laugh on a Friday night.",6,0,2,22 February 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Give Taika Waititi all the Marvel films (and DC whilst you're at it)
","As someone who watches Marvel films more to understand their universe better, rather than expecting a good film, Thor: Ragnarok was both a pleasant surprise and a great watch. Reviews of this genre tend to always be generous, but this film (led amazingly by Chris Hemsworth) was genuinely worth the watch for all the reasons superheroes should be.The action was the best for a Marvel film to date, with great fight scenes, intelligent choreography and legitimate balance between those involved. The set design and score lend a hand into the execution of this as well; flawless CGI and the best score to date (bar the GotG series) allowed for full immersion, only broken by the necessary dialogue used in the film.Comedically, I would have no doubt as putting this as the best Marvel film to date - Waititi does justice to a great script, with Hemsworth (who Waititi said had been underused as a comedic actor in the past), Blanchett and Hiddleston (plus an unlikely source in new character Korg) all being cast brilliantly, just to name a few. The casting was exceptional in allowing the funny side of this film through, with even the minor actors like Jeff Goldblum and a cameo-ed Matt Damon making scenes even more memorable. Taika brought all the necessary elements together seamlessly, making watching this film a spectacle in storytelling, rather than a predictable going-through- the-motions that is so common with movies of this ilk.Overall, whilst this film may not have had a major impact on the MCU as a whole, Thor: Ragnarok gave me hope for a genre been bled dry in its current state, and making me pray for a suitably brilliant ending for the Infinity Wars films to come. I urge the DC directors out there (if there are any others than Zack Snyder) to take a leaf from Taika Waititi's book, and see that the superhero genre has so much more to offer.",8,2,8,26 November 2017
The Hateful Eight," A rare Tarantino misfire
","On the surface and premise alone, this film gives the impression of another strong outing from the mind of Quentin Tarantino: a group of nefarious characters take shelter from a Wyoming winter storm together, unaware of one another's intentions. Unfortunately, the end product is anything but enjoyable, a tedious story lumbering between each subplot, split up by occasional shots of gratuitous violence.The Hateful Eight suffers in part from trying to be 'more Tarantino than Tarantino', playing on his movie trademarks to the point of annoying the audience. A prime example is shown in the opening scenes, where a single drawn out shot of the US wilderness is shown for around 5 minutes. Whilst bearable to begin with, these clichés soon drag, and by the end of the considerable run time you'll be looking for the door.The story lacks any real cohesion as well, opening on the pretence of an intricate backstory-driven tale, but in practice offering little development. Samuel L Jackson (and for the most part, the rest of the cast) give noble performances, but they aren't enough to truly elevate this film. The cinematography is exquisite where given the opportunity to shine, but the limited focus of the film prevents this from really salvaging the story.Having tried this film several times, on each occasion I was met with the same senses of both creeping boredom and annoyance at the promise not capitalised on. As with actors and directors of Tarantino's calibre, there is a delusion to immediately hail any work as an immediate classic - The Hateful Eight does not deserve to be included in this category.",5,3,7,28 May 2019
Crash," The benchmark for filmmaking
","Crash deservedly earned the Oscar for Best Picture, and it is not hard to see why: the intricate storyline, stellar characters, and complimentary soundtrack allows this film to effectively capture the inherent racism present in society, set across the sprawling backdrop of LA. Rarely can films make you feel as if the scenes depicted have enough realism to them, but Crash bridges the gap between comedy, drama and believable emotion.Casting in this film is exemplary; Michael Peña and Don Cheadle are the standouts, both giving lifetime performances representing minorities disadvantaged purely by their background. The former is the heart of the film's most emotional storyline, meriting a film in and of itself, a good-natured locksmith stereotyped as a gang member. Cheadle's character is more complex, a person torn between his loyalty to his job and preventing prejudices from altering his perception of others. A special (albeit surprising) mention must be given to Ludacris, a small-time crook who waxes lyrical of the injustices in society, whilst also stealing cars and making his own contentious decisions.Overall, Crash delivers twists unlike many other films can, and deservedly earns a rating as high as this. Whilst some still maintain other films deserved Best Picture over Crash (its class also featured highly-acclaimed Brokeback Mountain and Capote), to me no other films have hit emotional notes as brilliantly as this.",10,1,2,13 February 2019
Snatch," Brazen, unadulterated cockney crime madness
","The brilliance of Snatch is its pure mayhem. No sentence is wasted, threat without menace, or decision without consequences. The ragtag cast of misfits, elite thieves, mercenary thugs and illegitimate jewellers all connect via a web of misdeeds and criminal activity, allowing the story to expertly weave several stories together over the course of under 2 hours. Narrated by the pseudo-lead character, a boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham), the progress of a large diamond robbery is charted throughout the bowels of London, causing a chain-reaction of events to shake the crime world.The cast is exemplary: Benicia Del Toro, Vinnie Jones and Dennis Farina are all central roles, and Brad Pitt even requested a role in the film, such is his admiration for Guy Ritchie's work. Bright characters populate the world, giving each actor more scope to really embody their roles. The quickness of the script makes every interaction biting and aggressive, with the potential for a fight to break out any second. Guy Ritchie's personal cinematic tropes are also on full display: quick-cuts, split screen frames and tracking shots are all used to maximum effectiveness, enhancing the quirkiness of every scene.The story almost becomes a subsection of the film - the novelty of the experience itself and the crass British humour really makes Snatch special, with a well-written script merely promoting its excellence. This film also has a degree of rewatchability that most films of the genre would lose - especially in a comedic sense. Snatch is unapologetic in its execution, and well worth your time.",8,1,2,11 June 2019
Interstellar," A true cinematic masterpiece - flawless from start to finish
","Interstellar doesn't put a foot wrong, a brilliant 169 minutes covering space, survival and raw human emotion. Hans Zimmer's near-perfect soundtrack is the ideal accompaniment to these epic scenes, adding drama and gravity to every meticulous shot. Equally, the storyline is beyond gripping, a brutally believable tale of a desperate, dying race driven to do anything for survival, balanced against what a father would do for his children.Christopher Nolan's vision of a dying Earth is a stark blend of oranges and greens - crop fields stretching for miles, only to be overwhelmed by the towering dust storms. Leaving Earth, space (and indeed the planets visited) are all equally magical in their own unique ways: Miller's aquatic landscape is eerily bleak, whilst Mann's ice planet is as mind-bending as it is picturesque. Space travel is also done true justice, using wide-angle shots to both convey the vastness of space and the insignificance of man.Matthew McConaughey was practically built for this role, a farmer-turned-engineer trying to juggle saving earth and saving his family; his interactions with Brand (Anne Hathaway) and his daughter Murphy (Jessica Chastain) define the film, testing the strengths of human relationships and their value, even over the distances of space. Credit must also be given to TARS (Bill Irwin), a superbly written, pseudo-sentient robot that becomes as integral a member of the crew as any other.Interstellar is arguably the best sci-fi/space film ever created, superb in every way. The reported scientific accuracy Nolan paid attention to when writing the film is the icing on the cake, allowing the plot to be full lived - unlike anything that has come before.",10,0,1,2 May 2019
Forrest Gump," A sensitive journey through a tumultuous America
","Arguably Tom Hanks' finest example of his acting range, Forrest Gump is about as challenging a role a modern actor could be charged with: trying to merge compassion and inadvertent humour alongside mental impairment is a recipe for disaster, but Hanks navigates it flawlessly. The incidents of Watergate, Vietnam and several presidencies are retold through the life of a boy-turned-man swept up by these current affairs, all whilst trying to get back to his childhood love Jenny (Robin Wright).By having several stories contained within one film, emotional ties are given more value, spanning years and experiences. In particular, Forrest's relationship with Lt. Dan (Gary Sinese) is enduring, lasting even after the events during their time in Vietnam. Several large historical events are (somewhat fictionally) retold, with Forrest managing to crop up in the most unlikely places - however, his naivety shines through, giving the film a lighthearted touch that can be lost when tackling issues as serious as war and racism.Forrest Gump's brilliance is through making a scene funny one second, before pulling on heartstrings the next. This seamless transition is a true feat in cinema, represented by Forrest Gump's overwhelming success (winning 6 Oscars in 1995). This film is also truly unique in its ability to be entertaining for almost any demographic - represented by its enduring success 25 years later.",9,1,1,8 May 2019
Nightcrawler," Beyond creepy - Gyllenhaal was built for this
","As films go, this seems like an unassuming story - a journalist following stories in LA to make money photographing crime scenes - but nothing about Nightcrawler is to be expected. Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal on one of his strongest roles to date) is one of the most unsettling characters in film today, a disjointed, borderline criminal looking for both an adrenaline rush and easy money. Bloom is undoubtedly what makes this movie, but there is far more to it than just well-written characters.The dynamic between Gyllenhaal and Rick (the role that brought Riz Ahmed to American audiences) shows how uneasy the atmosphere is, whilst the competition with rival cameraman Joe Loder (played by the late Bill Paxton) shows just how far some people are willing to go for money. The deeper the plot goes, the more Bloom treads the border of sanity and the law, making decisions that others would consider reprehensible. Nightcrawler is worth watching for the tension and the drama - but don't forget to appreciate the darkness of LA's criminal underbelly.",8,1,1,27 April 2019
Oblivion," An under-appreciated sci-fi gem
","Do not be fooled by the premise of Tom Cruise in a futuristic post-apocalypse world: Oblivion is a sci-fi film of genuine quality and visual prowess, succeeding where a dearth of productions have tried (and failed) before. Oblivion does not require constant fight scenes and dramatic set pieces to hold the attention of the viewer, but instead delicately constructs an interesting story around the obscure history of conflict that has destroyed Earth. Jack (Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are two of the few survivors, veterans tasked with extracting the last of Earth's resources to power the remnants of humanity; however, they must also tackle the alien presence still lingering on the ground, who are intent on disrupting their efforts. When an unidentified ship crashes back on Earth without warning, the two are sent into a spiral of confusion around who can be trusted - and whether their memories have stood the test of time.Oblivion's mastery comes through their development of each character's loneliness: Jack and Victoria's only other human contact is a satellite link to their mothership off-world, amplifying the lack of empathy their job entails. The explorer of the two, Jack, has a hidden retreat in one of the safe zones on Earth (unbeknownst to Victoria); this example of the lack of complete transparency shows the seeds of doubt in both of the humans - fated to be able to trust nobody else, but still sceptical of every decision. Jack is also haunted by memories from before Earth's demise, constantly lingering but hidden from his partner. Director Joseph Kosinski's vision of a depleted Earth is hauntingly beautiful, a stark expanse awash with greys and blues, devoid of life. In direct contrast, the crew's machinery is precise and clean, bright white droids tasked with eliminating anything not perceived as human.Without giving too much away, the storyline's ability to open up and challenge the audience makes Oblivion a more rewarding film than it's given credit for; Cruise acts well throughout, exhibiting more empathy than he's known for showing. The score from French electronic outfit M83 is the ideal accompaniment for the mysterious nature of the wasteland, and does a fantastic job of building each scene without using music typical of the sci-fi genre. Oblivion will surprise those who wouldn't normally consider this their style of film, but is more than just a run-of-the-mill futuristic thriller.",8,2,2,18 June 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Excellent music masking an average biopic
","Below the surface, Bohemian Rhapsody is not much more than an average amount of insight into Freddie Mercury's storied life, stretching from his start in music to the heights of stardom. A cursory search on the internet would glean as much information on Queen's history, which suggests that the band takes somewhat of a back seat to the main character (who I must admit is played very capably by Rami Malek); the real Brian May even expressed his disappointment in the fact that the storyline becomes marginalised by the music. Moreover, the story almost becomes too confused with Mercury's personal life - to me, this feels like a device to give the film some sort of dilemma, where ultimately none existed.Regardless of this, Queen's starpower and Malek's performance saves this film: thumping anthems, big set pieces, and accurate musical performances make the big budget scenes really pop, particularly when reimagining Live Aid. Mercury allows the scenes to envelope you, focussing solely on the music and forgetting the interludes of storyline that almost feel required to allow the next song to be played.I believe it says something when most of the other reviews of Bohemian Rhapsody focus mostly on the music - a core element to a quality film must be missing, explaining the divide between critics and casual viewers. A sense of nostalgia may even be possible with someone who grew up with Queen, but this isn't enough to elevate the entire experience to being truly special.",6,2,4,8 April 2019
Bird Box," Not just a victim of the hype
","I'm not personally a massive fan of Sandra Bullock and her movies to begin with, but I tried to watch this with an open mind; regardless, this is a film with a lot of star power and budget... and not much else. Netflix's exceptional ability to promote mediocre films may bring them some serious revenue, but hasn't translated into many quality end products. The eventual disappointment of wasting 2 hours of your life watching this travesty is beyond insulting.An interesting (if slightly saturated) premise of fearing an entity you cannot see made the underlying plot intriguing, but is not explored fully enough, nor given any sort of satisfactory conclusion. This hidden menace is a constant threat, but lacks any substance, meaning no true fear can be felt by the viewer. Without spoiling the film, know that plotholes and unfinished storytelling will leave you with more questions than when you started.Acting, on the whole, is good enough, along with some impressive CGI and grusome-enough death scenes. Bullock herself embodies the role well, but certain decisions and actions will have you shouting at the screen for something to begin to make sense. John Malkovich also provides some decent charisma, about the only person in the film who's character seems to make any sense. Bird Box is a 4 purely due to the redeeming qualities of acting and visuals. Not much else is on offer here, and as with nearly all horror films the end product is beyond disappointing.",4,2,6,13 January 2019
Watchmen," A superhero film with substance beneath the surface
","Typically if you go and watch a Marvel film you'll get bright colours, a superficial plot, and a predictable ending. Watchmen does not conform to these stereotypes, which is exactly what makes this film stand out in a cluttered market. As with the Dark Knight trilogy, having a storyline that actually challenges the audience makes for far improved viewing. Watchmen's story of an alternate world where superheroes are now defunct changes the dynamic from the start, along with the imminent threat of nuclear war. The vulnerability of these (mostly) human superheroes adds an element of suspense not often found with Marvel/DC films.The acting in Watchmen is good, but really the devotion to the source material is what elevates the entire film. The comics were so well written (as indicated by their success) that no deviation is required, beautifully set amongst the grime of 1980s Manhattan. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) plays narrator for the majority of the film, a pessimistic ex-hero longing for a return to the glory days; his pursuit of the truth is relentless, but personally Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the undoubted draw. Crudup doesn't have to display much range, but his brutal honestly provides an amazing contrast to the selfishness of human empathy throughout the movie. Visually and musically, Watchmen is also elite - the score samples the best of 80s music, whilst the palette of vivid yellows and blues cuts through the darkness emulating the film's tone.It's sad that Zack Snyder failed to replicate Watchmen in any of the films he's directed since (Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman etc.) - if he could find this formula again, DC would be in far safer hands. Watchmen cuts itself a niche in a crowded superhero genre, and superheroes are all the better for it.",9,10,16,9 May 2019
The Village," Ignore the Shyamalan stigma - this is a gem
","In recent years, M Night Shyamalan's reputation has taken a serious beating, having directed universally panned Razzy films (such as The Last Airbender and The Happening), and even some recent successes (Split, Glass) haven't been enough to salvage his career. However, slightly earlier in his directorial filmography sits this genuine horror-mystery masterpiece, criminally underrated and judged undeservedly.The Village is a different take on a horror trope, detailing an isolated community's resolve against a hidden threat in the surrounding forest. As this genre goes, the cast does not get any better: Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody and Brendan Gleeson all feature prominently, as well as relative unknowns Jesse Eisenberg and Dallas Bryce Howard in some of their earlier roles. All are individually excellent and well-cast, perfectly depicting the repressed fear of a society without outside influences.The plot of is consistent and of genuine quality, which doesn't often translate in the horror genre; however, do not be dissuaded by the premise of horror - The Village plays more off the resulting drama than cheap jump scares, and slow burns until the revelations in the second half blow the script open. The forest village is the ideal setting for this hidden evil, sparsely populated and somewhat bleak - the integral use of red and yellow elevate the cinematography further, making the environment more distressing.The Village should be a must-watch purely on the merit of the plot: some may not connect with the subtleties of the script and the nuances of the story, but those who take the time to invest will be thoroughly rewarded with a quality film.",8,20,22,28 May 2019
American Psycho," Quiet, understated brilliance in Bale's (re)breakout role
","American Psycho is a genre-defining piece, if only for its quotability and warped outlook on the modern USA. Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) is the ultimate pseudo-horror character: precise, meticulous and superficially perfect. However, below this exterior, Bateman shows a twisted mind obsessed with murder and torture, a profile he struggles to hide throughout his everyday life. As the film progresses, the mannerisms of Bateman begin to make more and more sense - always calculated and disguised, but verging on being discovered for who he truly is.Bateman's interactions with his closest 'friends' are the most fascinating to watch, as he pretends to buy into the high life of Manhattan purely to maintain his social image. Talking to his fiancee Evelyn (Reece Witherspoon) seems like an actual chore to Bateman, from which his only real reprieve is 80s music. Ultimately, you don't watch the film for the violence and the brief scenes of madness, but for the tightrope Bateman walks in living an everyday, affluent life.Overall, American Psycho is a cultish classic, but still offers a brilliant story of insanity through an antagonist's eyes, whilst being instantly memorable.",8,1,1,8 April 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Worthy of the Oscar plaudits
","I went into this film expecting a soft, basic Spider-Man flick (as all of the other Spider-Man's have been). This, however, was not as I anticipated - well paced, humoured and well voiced, this is a triumph both artistically and cinematically. A rich cast helps boost a strong script, with sufficient backstory and dialogue to please both the casual superhero fan and the more hardcore followers.The art style is also worth appreciating; hand drawn frames, taking up to a week per second of screen time, painstakingly edited to give everything a 'comic book' feel. Even the up-to-date soundtrack perfectly accompanies the storyline when required. Without spoiling anything, this film delivers on all accounts - funny, emotional and well worth the time.",8,0,1,14 March 2019
American History X," Nazism from a new angle, but too reliant on its lead performance
","Highly regarded and seen as one of Edward Norton's most prominent roles to date, American History X is a dark retelling of racial tensions and Nazism in modern America, highlighting the unending vicious circle of conflict. Personally, Norton is leant heavily on to bring this film to life: the concept is without a doubt interesting, but doesn't go deep enough to really highlight the beliefs and thoughts of those so opposed to other belief systems and races.The story is self-explanatory enough: following a stint in prison, Derek Vinyard (Norton) tries to distance himself from his Nazi past, before realising his younger brother Danny (capably played by Edward Furlong) is already deeply integrated. Flashbacks of Vinyard's past (all shown in black and white) detail parts of his family's history, explaining his journey from one of the most hardened affiliates of the party to a far more self-aware character. Throughout the film he tries his best not to let Danny get sucked in further, but every action has an equally damaging consequence.Infamous for one scene in particular (a failed carjacking upon which a lack portion of the film is based), American History X actually isn't as revolutionary as it has been considered to be. No doubt interesting and somewhat thought provoking, some of the scenes seem gratuitous (both in violence and story-fleshing), fairing to really elevate the film. Norton himself is the gem, but without his stellar outing, it's hard to believe that this controversial film would truly be remembered today.",7,1,1,7 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Satisfying and heartfelt, but not the world-beater some are hailing Endgame to be
","Endgame should be revered purely based on the fact that the writers have managed to conclude virtually every storyline running in the Marvel universe. This was some feat, considering the vast numbers of important characters and the multiple timelines that needed closing. Further to this, none of the pivotal players were short changed in their conclusions, paying close attention to each one of the original Avengers cast.The film was also not saturated with fight scenes for its 3 hour run time, a real risk when producing superhero films - instead, character interactions were heavily utilised, employing slightly more pathos than Marvel films ordinarily use. Special mentions must go to Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who was uncharacteristically used almost exclusively as comedic relief - undoubtedly a risk, but one that succeeds thanks to Hemsworth's often-overlooked versatility as an actor. This was also Robert Downey Jr's best performance as Iron Man, with slightly fewer quips and more heartfelt emotion on display.Endgame is not, however, the perfect film: flaws are unavoidable in a universe as widely explored as this, and the major injustice seems to be the comparative screentimes and focus points on each character. The main culprit is Peppa Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), an entirely forgettable cast member from the Iron Man franchise, suddenly promoted to a semi-important role as one of the most powerful fighters...why? Why dilute the abilities of all of the other characters at your disposal and use Iron Man 2.0 (or 3.0 if you're also considering War Machine as an Iron Man copy) for the sake of it? Further to this, Captain Marvel once again disappoints. Her lack of meaningful involvement in the majority of the film makes the plot seem trivial and nonsensical, even more confusing when you consider the fact she was given an entire film only months before.On the reverse side of this, some important characters might as well not have even been looked at. The Guardians of the Galaxy (bar Rocket) were redundant in the film, strange considering the popularity of the spinoff franchise; furthermore, Nick Fury's borderline cameo appearance was a kick in the teeth for the longest tenured actor in the franchise.Whilst these criticisms are fairly harsh, this does not detract from the fact that Endgame is better than your average Marvel experience, and definitely does service to those fans who have stuck with the franchise for this long. Moreover, this film doesn't close the door to further films being made to continue the superhero trend. Unfortunately, as with most of these films/franchises, not enough is achieved to really propel this film into stardom - however, box office reports may yet prove me wrong.",7,1,6,29 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Twice the length required, half the film promised
","Quentin Tarantino is never going to get bad press as long as he draws breath; he's created his own self-sustaining bubble of rare releases, propped up by rave reviews from anyone who can scribble down a legible sentence on a page (hypocrite much?). OUATIH follows Rick Dalton and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt) as they try to stay afloat in a business leaving them behind, all whilst navigating the quirks of Hollywood. However, this idyllic story is not what many have claimed this film to be - sure, there are brief stylised glimpses of Hollywood's golden age, but they are too fleeting to really consider this film a tale of the era. Realistically, this is a mis-paced, mis-aligned story, and isn't half the film it could have been.Whilst everything is acted well and the set/costume design is incredible, ultimately Sharon Tate's character (played by Margot Robbie) could be cut from the film with zero loss. One moment you'll be watching DiCaprio and Pitt masterfully acting their respective roles (DiCaprio once again showing his effortless range), and the next you see Robbie sitting in a theatre for a 15-minute stint. It completely kills the first half of the film, and makes you wonder when the eventual plot device to marry the two groups is going to happen. Spoiler: it never comes, and by the end I was left wondering why half of the plot even happened. Its not that Margot Robbie's acting is bad (she is fairly strong as expected), or that her script isn't good - her character is just inconsequential, included solely to tie the plot to some semblance of reality. Only in the final half an hour does the plot begin to really move, and only then does Tarantino really produce some cinema magic.Dalton and Booth are undoubtedly the characters you go to see, but there are other exceptional performances: Timothy Olyphant, Mike Moh and Kurt Russell all lend good cameos, and breakout star Julia Butters (playing child actress Trudi) is incredible. This is also one of Tarantino's funnier scripts, with decent laughs from good writing and unexpected plot devices. However, this isn't enough to make up for a run time that is probably an hour too long, especially given the lack of content to actually pack out this blockbuster.",6,3,7,18 August 2019
Drive," An under appreciated and poignant work
","Drive is a rare success in that it manages to strike a balance between brutal violence and subtle pathos. By being a relatively light on conversational scenes, most of the emotion conveyed is through the exceptional music and shot design. This, in turn, means interactions have more meaning, as well as lending tension to the darker scenes.Do not be concerned that Drive skimps on the brutality: 'Driver' (Ryan Gosling) is note perfect in his acts of savagery, an unassuming figure but ruthless when required. His clinical nature makes scenes seem cold and calculated, so his new relationship with neighbour Irene (Carey Mulligan) offers a brighter outlook on his future. Special note must be given to Nino (Ron Perlman), providing the sadistic and brash opposite to Gosling.Drive is an unfairly overlooked work, and definitely deserves more attention than it's been given.",8,3,5,20 April 2019
1917," Style over substance - 1917 lacks an experienced mind
","1917's rave reviews have heralded the visuals and the storyline as elite; even the marketing campaign has gone to great lengths to demonstrate how the 'one-take' effect of the film as a masterful piece of cinema. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean the mediocre storyline really ever comes together; massive set-pieces and inspired lighting aren't enough to buoy the jumbled cameos and obvious cuts in scenes, which ultimately hurt 1917 more than they help. Some of the film is beautiful, but you were bound to hit the target once or twice considering how much Sam Mendes threw at this project.The story follows two British soldiers across uncharted territory, given only 24 hours to deliver a vital message to a general on the warpath. To me, this is an uncomplicated storyline that war films need to deliver on more - there is potential for drama, thrills and every setting imaginable - but writers have a habit of wanting to convolute the story. The plot does lean heavily (and not in a convincing way) on coincidental events to help drive the drama and tension, which does create a plot that verges on entirely incredulous.All of the sets are immaculate, constructed to utilise the weather and the light to create an atmosphere. The sets must have all been built to preserve the idea of a 'one-take' film, and this is 1917's downfall. The camera will follow the subject for 20 minutes at a time, navigating every obstacle that usually interferes with a shot, only to then pan behind an easily avoidable object like a rock. Why commit to this technique if you aren't doing it properly, or if you could do a better job with a few cuts? It baffles me that Mendes didn't realise cutting infrequently (such as in Birdman) would make a better-looking film than using unnatural frames to keep the one-shot integrity alive, and this sort of naivety is exactly why 1917 isn't as good as some people think.War films, in my opinion, should use unknowns for all roles apart from the leads. If you are trying to tell a story, it should not rely on A-list actors to prop up exposition, otherwise you lose the anonymity of war, and instead end up with a mismatch of famous faces. 1917 is guilty of this, with cameos rammed in left and right: Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden, Andrew Scott and others all appear for less than 5 minutes each, but break all realism when they rock up on screen. What is even worse is that they weren't given the roles because they required great acting talent to perform - they were just the most well-known people looking for a job.By the end of 1917, I wondered if the plot really mattered - it becomes somewhat lost amongst the flashy visuals and the blaring soundtrack. It wasn't a more considered work than other war films, and I would rather watch Saving Private Ryan or Beasts of No Nation than this frankly over-celebrated piece of cinema.",6,3,11,29 January 2020
Black Hawk Down," A big budget, low substance war film
","If you read other reviews of Black Hawk Down, people praise the realism of the conflict in Somalia, along with the accurate portrayals of the American forces against the rebelling usurpers. However, these people seem to 1) have no idea what the conflict in Somalia was actually like, and 2) be completely blinded by the film's huge budget allowing a lot of dramatic set pieces.Without a doubt this is a good war film: a cast ahead of its time (such as relative unknowns Orlando Bloom and Ewan McGregor) dropped into a war zone very different to those often portrayed on the big screen. Beyond this, however, not a lot more is on show - the fight scenes are predictable and simplistic, and a script isn't really required in between the bursts of gunfire. Black Hawk Down also leans fairly heavily on the trope of 'down but not out', as every squad seems to be afflicted by someone who is a magnet for shrapnel and bullets, but continues to push through the swathes of war.The production value salvages a lot for this movie, creating an atmosphere of legitimate danger often missing from action films. Furthermore, the use of aerial combat shows a degree of confidence from the producers (often avoided when budgets are slightly more restrictive). Black Hawk Down doesn't quite exceed the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but certaininly is above average on the merits of its hectic battle scenes.",7,2,3,14 May 2019
Logan," Gritty, dark, and everything missing from the rest of the X-Men franchise
","Superhero films typically have to go down one of two avenues: colourful and humorous (e.g. Avengers, GotG) or more realistic and tough (e.g. The Dark Knight, Watchmen). Logan opts for the latter, producing a film worthy of Hugh Jackman, an actor typically starved of decent screen roles when playing Wolverine. Previous instalments in the Wolverine franchise have been average to poor, making Logan an important film for multiple reasons (especially given X-Men's loss of ground to the rest of the Marvel universe). By stepping away from the rest of the Marvel universe, the story doesn't become saturated with other characters crowbarred into the plot, giving Wolverine what he deserves.To merge these two themes of darkness and lightheartedness is near-impossible, as pandering to child and adult audiences is more than difficult. Logan does as good a job as can be expected, using humour sparsely without ruining emotional moments that make up the core of the film. Jackman is unshakeable in his titular role, bringing the same intensity he has to the Wolverine role he had for the previous 16 years; this film allowed him to flex his acting muscles slightly more freely, not constrained by superhero films' typically wooden scripts. Patrick Stewart is also excellent as Professor X, reduced to an ambling shell of what he used to be, but ultimately Logan's only friend.The storyline of Logan isn't a world-beater (Wolverine seems to suffer from a lack of decent plots), but for someone who has stuck with the franchise for its duration, it will surely satisfy any hardcore fans. As a standalone, Logan holds itself in higher regard than almost any other superhero film, delivering emotional punches successfully without cheapening scenes using ill-timed humour.",8,2,5,7 May 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Brilliant...until you reach the ending
","My first experience of Stanley Kubrick was 2001: A Space Odyssey, a revolutionary, extraordinary and enlightening journey through the existence of humanity and its exploration of space. The first 2 hours are pure enjoyment as the course of human history is charted (accompanied by one of the most famous film scores of all time) up to the present day, all whilst pondering the existence of an artefact found on Earth.The space travel, however, is where this film truly shines: for the late 60s, every visual must have been pioneering, depicting space, future life and artificial intelligence beautifully. HAL 9000 is the looming presence here, an entity of which its level or control cannot be fully comprehended, seeing as the other characters rely on him so heavily. HAL's interactions with the crew is unbelievably sinister, as the lack of tone allows nothing to be given away emotionally, even if you sense something is afoot. As the film progresses further, these visuals continue to astound, with meticulous set design and amazing use of slow, quiet scenes to build tension and emotion. Everything you have seen then builds towards the final eventuality - disappointment.Kubrick almost shot himself in the foot by attempting such an ambitious storyline, as some viewers would ultimately never find the ending satisfactory. However, personally the ending just doesn't achieve anything; none of the story is fully explored nor understandable, and it feels like a jumbled mess of conclusions rushed to (with some arresting visuals to boot). I would recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey purely on the first 2/3 of the film - just don't expect the all-encompassing ending you're hoping for.",7,1,2,8 April 2019
Midsommar," So much promise destroyed by a total lack of story
","It's like a curse with horror films - good trailer, good visuals, a decent first half - and then absolutely no end product. A24 Studios are a prime culprit themselves, having now produced three individual horror films (It Comes At Night, The Witch) that all fail to deliver on expectations past a pleasing aesthetic. Horror has always been an oversaturated genre with very little quality, but this is normally down to a terrible storyline or a plot that has no visual quality to back it up. Arguably, examples such as Midsommar are even worse, when given a budget and platform without a worthy script.Midsommar follows Dani (Florence Pugh), a deeply disturbed 20-something going on holiday with her boyfriend and his friends to Sweden for a mid-summer festival. Following the death of her sister and parents 6 months earlier (in an intensely disturbing but gripping opening scene), her mental state is vulnerable, leading her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) to resent her somewhat, particularly when she decides to join them on their trip. The opening hour is full of bright visuals, fields in full bloom and some light-hearted traditions; these slowly begin to degrade into slightly more sinister rituals, as the group become fractured through their individual experiences at the festival.This is where the plot begins to die: Midsommar (just like with so many other horror flicks) commits the cardinal sin of leaving the story to 'the audience's interpretation'. This is not a clever technique, and only works if the foundations are extraordinarily well-built; otherwise, the production company is solely to blame for lazy writing. Everything falls apart - none of the group question the obviously insane actions of the cult, nor the growing numbers of disappearing people. In the end, you're waiting for the film to end purely to stop wasting your time with pseudo-mysticism.",5,2,4,6 August 2019
Sicario," Brilliant cinematography and dark realism
","Sicario is an enigma: some of the film is near perfect (notably the border crossing scene), striking the right balance of tension and drama, without losing realism. The portrayal of cartel-controlled Mexico is bleak and unforgiving, creating an appropriate sense of paranoia and isolating the American soldiers sent across the border. Unfortunately, between these scenes, there is a lack of meaningful storyline - Emily Blunt's character seems miscast, constantly unaware of the situation. Whilst (to an extent) this makes sense, as the film progresses this begins to drag somewhat.The real character of interest is undoubtedly the understated mercenary Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), someone connected to the cartels but with his own personal stake in the matter; his introduction scene (involving some suggested torture) is darkly realistic, and his motives remain a mystery until the very end. This, however, is part of the issue with Sicario - the 'take down the drugs trade from the inside' plot device feels unimportant until you realise the underlying goal of the mission, preventing this film from really exceeding expectations. Whilst no doubt interesting, not engaging with the story makes enjoying Sicario more difficult than necessary.",7,2,3,20 April 2019
The Disaster Artist," Francos having a laugh eventually loses its novelty
","Built off the delayed success of the cult phenomenon 'The Room', arguably the worst film ever produced, Disaster Artist charts the history of the film's conception. At the heart is Greg (Dave Franco), a stuttering movie star wannabe taken under the wing of the overconfident stranger (and now legendary figure) Tommy Wiseau (played by James Franco). Having relocated to Hollywood in pursuit of work, the pair eventually decide to produce their own movie penned by Tommy - a story with parallels of their own lives.This whole film is built of the absurd background of the film and Tommy Wiseau, along with a few famous scenes from the original; however, past this exterior, the laughs and the quality is fairly lacking, since the source material doesn't really offer much outside what was shown on the big screen. The Francos have good chemistry together (as you would expect) and play their roles well, but the serious tone sometimes feels too strong for this light-hearted comedy. Several other heavyweight actors cameo in the film for added value: Zac Efron, Seth Rogen, Josh Hutcherson, and others feature, deliberately cast in roles not normally typecast for them, giving the film a bit of extra amusement.Unfortunately, very little is explored into Wiseau and his past - where he originated from (he claims 'New Orleans', but in a heavy Eastern European accent) and the source of his money remain a mystery. However, Disaster Artist still serves its role as a comedy-drama that doesn't take itself too seriously for the most part, and to a genuine devotee to The Room, will definitely do the story justice.",6,1,1,27 August 2019
There Will Be Blood," What the hell was all that about?
","I've seen one Daniel Day-Lewis film before now (Gangs of New York with DiCaprio), and I wasn't massively impressed then, but There Will Be Blood is a completely different beast. The premise - a man driven to build his family oil business as big as he can - really appeals to me, and the stills I'd seen of some scenes only added to this anticipation. After the tortuous 2 hours and 38 minutes of screen time, I was left scratching my head, wondering if I'd even seen something I would remember tomorrow morning.The first half an hour is devoid of speaking: only the sounds of oil bubbling through the ground and the grunts of the men drilling it can be heard. It's probably the most emotive and accurate of the film, and I was really enjoying the finality of every decision Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) made whilst he was starting out his business. Unfortunately, the director then feels the need to add more characters - they are well-acted, that isn't the issue, it's more just the lack of necessity to each one. One moment they are barely acting at all, speaking at a murmur, the next they launch into a volley of screaming tirade, acting irrationally.As the plot creeps along, you wonder what the point really is. Plainview succeeds early on (this is no spoiler), and has some nonsensical relationships with his adopted son and a local preacher who told him where to drill. It doesn't offer any peril, any drama - weirdly, this felt like a film that might have been better fleshed out as a television drama over the course of a season. There are nice shots throughout using oil as the artistic medium, almost to represent blood within the plot; the music, however, is quite erratic and jarring, not always fitting the moment comfortably.Day-Lewis won an Oscar for his portrayal, but frankly all I saw was really aggressive over-acting alongside a 'method-acting' ethos that seems to earn more respect than it sometimes should. When the end credits rolled, my mum and I looked at one another, and the first thing she said was 'What a  waste of time' - so Happy Mother's Day to you.",Null,2,2,22 March 2020
Joker," Joker is no laughing matter
","I was worried before I watched Joker: another film hyped to unachievable expectations off the back of extensive media campaigns and a comic book conception. Further to this, there was always a shadow over this production - trying to equal the supreme performance of Heath Ledger in the same role a decade before. Thankfully, Joker is not only an excellent piece of cinema, but also makes a clear definition between Joaquin Phoenix's (Arthur Fleck) and Heath Ledger's (The Joker) characters. The issue with 'Suicide Squad' (other than the generally awful quality of the film), is that Jared Leto was trying to create a persona of the same notions as Ledger. Phoenix forges his own direction by not being a villainous antagonist for a superhero story, but being a mentally unhinged loser who finds his own direction in a city that has none.Joker charts the development of Fleck into the eponymous role through stages of transformation. He begins as a man down on luck, money and friends, shackled by a mental illness and a debilitated mother. Fleck's relationship with his neighbour Sophie, played by Zazie Beetz ('Atlanta', 'Sorry To Bother You'), is particularly brilliant, with the directing decisions making each scene hard to delineate into fiction or reality. From the first half hour, suddenly you see Fleck's change of heart: a newfound confidence, a loss of moral direction, and a spark of ambition. To this end, Joaquin Phoenix has mastered the role, tailoring his movements and tendencies to reflect his own image of Joker. An Oscar nomination for him seems likely, and a win wouldn't be unbelievable, especially given the press around this production.The city of Gotham personifies everything in Fleck's own life; civil service cuts and strikes mean rubbish is piling up in the streets, and sewer rats run wild above ground. Lawrence Sher's cinematography enhances this vision, using extended shots of graffitied subways and brutalist architecture to cultivate a city without soul. An extension of this is the people of Gotham. Nobody is a good person without a motive - even Thomas Wayne, the city's talisman, is an elitist who despises the working class. From this, you can see that Gotham is on the verge of a revolt, with civil unrest simmering below the dirty exterior of a metropolis long past its prime. To help inspire these scenes, an exemplary soundtrack from Hildur Guðnadóttir gives each moment more gravitas, and I would not be surprised to see her soon regarded in the same category as Hans Zimmer and John Williams.Those who go into Joker expecting a semblance of a superhero film will be sorely disappointed, and avoiding comic book tendencies is totally the correct move from Todd Phillips. This is not a hero/villain story, but a plot with its own dynamic, trying to develop sympathy with mental illness. Unfortunately it appears they could not, however, go an entire film without referencing Batman at all, and a shoe-horned in homage to the comic book ancestry somewhat spoils the emotional tension of the film. No doubt this is also a seriously graphic film, and should have even an 18 release without a doubt. A couple of scenes in Joker are legitimately some of the best I've seen this year: one act involving Fleck, a couple of clowns and some scissors in his apartment is potentially the cinematic masterpiece that could set this film apart from the rest.This is not, however, the perfect film, and for all its brilliance, some of the issues do remove you from the setting to a degree. Robert De Niro (who plays Gotham talk show host Murray Franklin) is wooden and uninspiring, but I can't tell if this is due to him actually playing the role well, or just being an average actor. I understand that saying such sacrilege against De Niro is tantamount to heresy, but in recent years I believe he has lost some range in his acting ability (see De Niro's recent films - 'Dirty Grandpa', 'Last Vegas' - and tell me I'm wrong).Strangely, even though Joker was enjoyable to watch, I don't think it inspires rewatching: it was uncomfortable viewing at times, but delivers an important and powerful story. Regardless, this is still undeniably some of the best cinema this year, and deserves your attention, even just for its devotion to explaining the fragility of humans' mentalities.",8,0,1,8 October 2019
Whiplash," Visceral and abrasive to the point of disbelief
","Following its critical acclaim, Whiplash was one of the films to see in 2014, a storied account of a promising orchestral drummer in over his head. On paper, this movie sounds like an excellent premise, non-conventional and darker than almost any other musically-oriented productions. However, the result didn't quite have the magic I was expecting; the aggression displayed by J.K. Simmons (who deservedly won numerous awards for his role) seemed misplaced given the nature of his job, and the film around him doesn't offer much else.Miles Teller (one of my least favourite actors working today) is well-suited for his leading role, balancing his character's fractured personality against his commitment to the music. It is also worth appreciating Teller's devotion to his performance, as he took 2-hour drum lessons 5 days a week for the 5 months prior to filming. Outside of Teller and Simmons, the rest of the film is just a foil to allow their chemistry to spark - constantly pushing against one another to see who will cave first. Their intentions, however, are not the same: Simmons has an element of pure hatred hard to capture on screen, further capturing the difficulty of his role.The camerawork is also strong, maximising darkened backgrounds and closeups to highlights the subtleties of each instrument's operations. Makeup is also used minimally but effectively, slowly building Teller's face up to emphasise the strain he undergoes for his job. Whiplash has a lot to like, but personally didn't grab me as the reviews suggested. If you can build the emotional connection with the leading roles, then Damien Chazelle's other directorial triumphs (First Man, La La Land) will also be worth your time.",7,0,0,11 May 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," As surreal as it is cinematically impressive
","Birdman is artistically novel in its use of a 'single' take: the first 15-20 minutes is one continuous shot, weaving through the fuddled depths of backstage theatre between cast and crew. The colours throughout are key to these shots not becoming tiresome - bright neons and glowing warm lights bathe the set, emphasising the emotions felt in each scene. Perhaps my favourite part of the film, however, is the seamless interlinking of both scenes and music. More than once, the near constant drumming accentuates scenes so well, along with the amazing orchestration of movement in and out of the theatre itself.As for the cast, you couldn't ask for much more - Keaton is great as a slightly haywire actor on the brink (with his alter ego muttering alongside him), but Norton shows his true ability by nailing the range of an aggressive, temperamental but caring theatre journeyman devoted to his work above all else. Stone, Galifianakis and Riseborough also lend their talents well.Birdman is worth watching purely to admire the feat of stringing these long takes together: however, a worthwhile plot and intriguing development also gives this film an edge not seen often in cinema today.",8,2,2,25 February 2019
Platoon," Vietnam's most faithful on-screen depiction
","Directed by a true veteran of Vietnam, Platoon devoutly follows Oliver Stone's vision and memory of the conflict - a humid mix of dense green jungles and invisible threats, poorly navigated by those young American troops thrust into its core. The focus is mainly on the narrator and rookie soldier Chris (a very new, slightly hammy, pre-drug-addled Charlie Sheen), a wealthier college dropout who realises his mistake instantly after joining the war effort. As he learns more about the true indecency of guerrilla warfare and the hopelessness of their plight, he slips further into the recesses of potential madness.The cast is undeniably talented, featuring big names such as Forest Whitaker, John C McGinley and even Johnny Depp. The real talent on show is Willem Dafoe - the friction between him and his opposing Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) is frighteningly believable, and makes you question what decisions you would make in their shoes. Each has their own motives, each their own feelings - but all undoubtedly feel an intense fear with each command from higher up.Platoon hasn't aged amazingly (the clunky CGI napalm scene springs to mind), but the vividness of Vietnam/Cambodia's vegetation is still as identifiable as ever. The Vietnamese troops are rarely given screentime, making them seem ever more omniscient when fighting the relatively clueless American troops. The sparse gunfights are also mostly at night, meaning the disorientation of the soldiers is equal to that of the audience. Platoon will always remain a piece of defining war cinema, full of iconic scenes and emulating the true story of Vietnam; it holds a place as one of the most accurate depictions to date.",7,0,1,4 August 2019
Marriage Story," Authentic performances in the best screenplay of 2019
","Director Noah Baumbach has created a beautiful piece of cinema with Marriage Story. A heartfelt and honest retelling of a divorce between two patrons of theatre, the dance between leads Adam Driver (Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole) is captivating cinema. Their interactions span quiet conversation to explosive argumentation, and they move seamlessly between the two thanks to a razor sharp script. The real art, however, is the infused comedic elements: they are subtle and disguised, but are welcome in snapping the viewer back to the realities of each situation.The couple's lives are a myriad of compromises that increase in complexity: whether to live in NYC or LA, who their young son Henry should stay with, and who's career prospects warrants the next jump into the unknown. Their divorce proceedings are amicable to begin, but external parties circumstances muddy the waters and soon every detail is scrutinised and manipulated. Watching the divorce lawyers have the argument they themselves cannot wrestle with is a bizarre concept, but shows the soullessness that breaking up a marriage can require; on top of this, the lawyers know nothing between them is personal, but that couldn't be further from the truth for Charlie and Nicole.The leads (and, indeed, the majority of the cast) are superb in their casting and performances. Adam Driver is already an actor I hold in very high regard - his flexibility and comedic qualities are a true gift, but his compassion and anger when acting are so believable. I feel some remorse for Johansson, in that she is largely known for her one-dimensional requirements to play Black Widow in the Marvel franchise, but this sort of work demonstrates her real talent in more weighty roles. The snap of the script is made even more impressive by knowing that virtually nothing is improvised - Baumbach has their hesitations and outbursts orchestrated to the finest details.Cinematographically, Marriage Story uses unique angles and environmental features to accentuate each shot and the feelings conveyed: the attitudes of the arthouse couple inspire these frames, where open plan rooms alongside continuous shots are effectively used. Some scenes are also filmed with shallow depths of field to make the subject sharp and resolute, a technique given additional power by the grainy effect applied to the footage. Classical compositions often accompany the emotion of the moment, but some scenes are bereft of music to let the viewer decide the mood for themselves.Baumbach's directorial methodology might be painstaking, but the rewards are clear to see. His vision is infectious, and he demonstrates such a unique style that, even if you cannot empathise with the story from personal experience, you become drawn in. Both Driver and Johannson may be in line for some heavyweight nominations come awards season, and any victories would be, in my book, wholly justified.",8,5,7,28 December 2019
Mother!," Tedious, pretentious, and ultimately annoying
","Apparently director Darren Aronofsky is incapable of producing well-received films without interspersing them with films that fail to please: whilst The Wrester and Requiem for a Dream have been acclaimed by critics, his other titles, such as Noah and Black Swan have only succeeded in aggravating people with their big picture connotations, loosely portrayed through clunky storytelling and often needless CGI.Mother! was a film I was looking forward to; Bardem and Lawrence headlining an all-star cast, with Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer also featuring - a promising cast, with a further intriguing trailer. However, just as with most of these big budget cast pictures, the film falls flat in its entirety, providing only a laboured view on a pseudo-religiously connotated story. From the very beginning, the confusion is immediate. A visibly stressed relationship between Bardem and Lawrence is apparent, with the former a struggling (but obviously revered) writer, and the latter painstakingly rebuilding and remodelling Bardem's family home. Approximately every 156 minutes, Lawrence's character seems to be either having a panic attack or drinking a strange yellow concoction, with little to no explanation for either. Upon Ed Harris' introduction, their lives begin to muddle with that of Harris' (and his wife, Pfeiffer). At this point in the film, the effort to try and continue watching is made even harder by Lawrence's refusal to speak for herself, as well as the overbearing use of audio to paint a deeper picture. This theme is present throughout the whole movie, and yet never lends itself to the element of 'horror' that this film was supposed to have. By halfway through, I was aware of the 'deeper meaning' the characters were supposed to be making us aware of, but by this time my investment in the film was so minimal that even trying to enjoy the events spiralling out of control was borderline impossible. Ultimately, Aronovsky only managed to provide a cinematic experience akin to these other films eluding to higher meanings (see: The Fountain), and failing to tell an engaging or enjoyable story at any point in the film.",3,1,1,5 January 2018
The Greatest Showman," Pleasantly surprised and relieved
","As a frequent moviegoer but not a particular fan of musicals due to early trauma caused by the awful Mamma Mia! film (soon to be films...), I was not confident that I would enjoy the Greatest Showman; regardless, I was dragged to see this by my girlfriend, but came out the other side very satisfied with what had been presented to me.Whilst the storyline is grandiose and fictionalised to a certain degree (such as PT Barnum being portrayed as a benevolent rags-to-riches character), the film does not require a convoluted plot - the magic is supposed to be in the eccentricity of the people, the colours of the settings and, of course, the core musical pieces. To this end, the Greatest Showman definitely succeeds: it combines all these elements into a thriving spectacle set among the gritty backdrop of a newly-industrialised New York. Barnum (played by Hugh Jackman) and his backstory is quickly and loosely explained, requiring no more than a brief explanation of his poor upbringing, but also his love for the wealthy and elite girl, Charity (Michelle Williams). In a matter of minutes, Barnum's quest to create the museum of oddities (soon to be known as the circus) comes to fruition, allowing the big-piece spectacles to flow thick and fast. As the centre of attention, Jackman manages to exude spirit and dramatic flair on all his showman scenes, which pulls the film along, dividing his efforts between musical numbers with furious choreography and the darker, more moody storyline. The divergence Barnum takes to tour with Jenny Lind (played by Rebecca Ferguson) only proves to be a minor detour, thankfully not detracting from the core principle of the film to a degree which ruins the flow of the story.At this point in the film, I had bought into the concept of the musical: I could now accept the film for what it was - a cacophony of colour and showmanship, to be taken light-heartedly and not to be dissected in the way the critics had approached it.",7,2,4,20 January 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Charming, innocent fun that doesn't shirk the gravity of the issue
","I imagine Taika Waititi's pitch to whichever film board gave him funding was an unusual one: a Jewish director wanting to make a Nazi-based comedy, where he would also play an imaginary Hitler. He was probably met with some raised eyebrows, some looks of disbelief, and maybe even a few laughs of incredulity. Regardless, this script and plot is airtight, portraying a child's formative years as a fanatic (albeit useless) member of the Hitler Youth, whilst also harbouring a Jewish refugee. The comedy is inoffensive and caters for all ages, with strong performances from some of Hollywood's most eminent figures. The seriousness of the issue, however, is never completely avoided, and Jojo Rabbit does a good job of still getting the point across about indoctrination and the severity of war.Jojo (played by Roman David Griffiths) is firm advocate for the Nazis (even after an incident at a training day involving a grenade), who finds himself conflicted when it's revealed his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl. This creates the divide of the film: during the day he does the menial work the party cannot be bothered to do themselves, and in the evenings he tries to dissect the mindset of the 'evil' Jewish race by interrogating his houseguest. Amongst all of this, Waititi's Hitler provides the most comic relief: being imaginary, he does everything from psyching Jojo up, to eating roast unicorn.Hitler is arguably the best device of the film - by being so friendly and funny, he lulls the viewer into a false sense of security, which by the end makes the audience question why they trusted this person to begin with. This gives some insight into how someone in Jojo's position could also buy into the idea of a perfect world under the Nazi party. Other notable performances come from the ever-brilliant Sam Rockwell as Captain Klezendorf, a former military man consigned to looking after children having lost an eye in the war, and Rebel Wilson as his associate Fraulein Rahm, a devout patriot who believes every rumour about the Jews is true. Jojo's best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) is harmless, but the dialogue between him and Jojo is fairly stale at times.Whilst the comedy dominates the movie on the whole, serious scenes are frequent. The darkness of the Nazi party's ideology is constantly reinforced - watching Jojo speak so hatefully about another race can be tricky to watch. You also get a strong sense of the disagreement between Jojo and his mother on the benefits of the war, and how the conflict may have looked from both sides. There are some clunky elements to the storyline: Jojo's father and sister are both eluded to constantly, but neither really have any influence on the plot. It may be heavy-handed to crowbar them into the story at the end, but a lack of representation made their inclusion confusing.Visually, the film is bright, using quirky costume designs and decor to make the era feel lively. Alongside this is the brilliant soundtrack: several iconic British anthems, re-recorded in German to add to the authenticity of the film. As the storyline progresses and the war draws to a close, the town itself begins to lose colour and light, using weather to foreshadow the fate of the Nazis. Whilst Jojo Rabbit doesn't really push any storytelling boundaries (as you might expect of a film with this subject matter), it does a good job of being fun and accessible. Waititi has a habit of making films appealing in this way, and I would consider this another job well done.",7,0,1,7 January 2020
Green Book," Heartwarming and evocative
","Green Book tackles the difficult and seldom approached issue of racism in America, something still contentious today; however, the script allows both a serious message whilst not muddling the issue with a message too heavy for the nature of the film.Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are Oscar-worthy, both turning in performances accurately and with subtle nuances giving an added depth. Artistry and costume design is brilliant, along with the depiction of New York at the beginning and end of the film.Overall, Green Book is a pure film with good intentions - the music backs the excellent casting and well-thought script to create a complete piece, worthy of watching.",7,1,1,13 February 2019
Annihilation," Promising start, frantic middle and muddled ending
","Annihilation was always going to be an ambitious task, adapting Jeff VanderMeer's defining novel into a suitable cinematic experience. On initial viewing, you think this has been accomplished: swathes of exotic environments, bright colours and curious organisms fill the scenes, providing a surreal but ominous backdrop for Lena (Natalie Portman) and her expedition. Some of the graphic effects are amazing, fully conveying their intended dread. However, as the story progresses, this magic begins to be lost - only so much CGI can be used before becoming oversaturated, a gamble which this film decides to risk.In terms of acting, the all-star cast (Portman, Oscar Isaac, Tessa Thompson) all lend their own devices to building suspense and mystery, with Portman being given the bulk of the difficult material. This becomes difficult to appreciate, however, after the plot begins to give way to gratuitous violence and fight scenes. Soon after, the story seems to fall apart completely, culminating an an ending that is as dissatisfying as it is nonsensical. Annihilation is worth watching purely to give credit to the visual effects on show, not to mention if you are partial to a sci-fi flick. Beyond this, however, a shallow plot prevents this film from really separating itself from mediocrity.",6,2,3,15 April 2019
Gladiator," Ridley Scott's defining masterpiece
","Gladiator is the prime example of filmmaking at its best: massive set pieces, honest acting, and a plot to back up the gravity of the scenes. Moving from the forests of Germany and the fighting pits of Zucchabar, before culminating in the Colosseum of Rome, Scott's historical epic flows seamlessly. Russell Crowe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the grizzled but vengeful Maximus, plotting a course back to the Emperor Commodus (equally brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix). The fighting pits emulate the unrest within the capital, as discord grows between the emperor and the Senate.Fighting scenes are appropriately epic: realistic imagery and brutal military style are on full show, accentuated by the devotion paid to the costume design of the film. Hans Zimmer is, as usual, perfect in scoring the film, adding both a solemness to darker scenes, whilst capturing the heat of battle when required. The fine acting is merely the icing on the cake. Not a wrong step is taken, from the leads down to the more minor roles (a personal favourite is Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' gladiatorial ally Juba).Gladiator comes together perfectly in all facets of film - there is a perfectly good reason this is such a highly acclaimed film, and for all the right reasons. Ridley Scott has earned his reputation here.",10,5,7,31 March 2019
Princess Mononoke," The jewel in Ghibli's crown
","Studio Ghibli almost exclusively produce great films, but Mononoke is more than just colours and smooth animation: it is a complex story of man's attempts to harness nature, and how it shouldn't be a conflict, but instead should be a symbiotic relationship. Using 14th century Japan as the vehicle for this story is perfect - as the nation undergoes an industrial evolution, the forest tries to fight back, and only Ashitaka (the main character) seems to see the full picture.For something animated as far back at 1997, Princess Mononoke looks immaculate. The quality of animation is second to none, and the creativity that went into the aesthetic and the environment is amazing. The accompanying soundtrack is very good: subtle enough not to override the delicacy of some scenes, but still lends sufficient power to more dramatic moments. There is also an abundance of decent voice actors too - Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, John DiMaggio and many others lend their talents to this film, which makes the voice-dubbed version a painless experience.The story is both fantasy and action, a love story and a war film; so many elements combine for this plot, and the film is all the better for it. Loosely, the story follows a prince trying to find the cure for a curse inflicted upon him by a demon, but there is a lot more to it; the relationship between Ashitaka and Mononoke herself is one of both love and hate, since they both care too much for humans and the forest respectively to let one destroy the other.Words don't really do justice to just how good Princess Mononoke is. I know some people won't really understand just why I think this is such a masterpiece of cinema, but there is both nostalgia and emotional power to this film. I know for those that do connect with Mononoke, they will never forget this feature.",10,0,0,12 March 2020
