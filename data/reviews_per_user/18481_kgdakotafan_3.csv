Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill Volume II
","Many fans wonder why Volume I and Volume II weren't compacted into one big movie. After seeing this, I realize why. The tone of the movies are so different from each other. There is way less cinematic sampling in this volume and more focus on dialogue and character development. The audience is asked to deepen their care for the characters. So many of the questions that the audience wondered about in the first volume are answered here. We learn about how Beatrix 'The Bride' Kiddo fell for a nice, record store working loser. She did it because she wanted her daughter to start with a clean slate. We learn that his daughter is still alive, and we learn why Bill wanted to kill his former girlfriend. In the film, a story called 'The Legend of Pai Mai' is told from Bill to the Bride when they are dating. It's about a woman who didn't recognize her husband's graciousness and left him, and he tried to kill her but failed, and she got revenge. That was an interesting metaphor for the movie as a whole. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is a sick, twisted, wicked dog but makes for a kickass character, and the music towards the end evokes many strange emotions. But most of all, there's a happy ending (The lioness and cub reunite!)",9,0,1,1 October 2009
Public Enemies," Pretentious, unedited garbage with poor cameramatics
","What can I say that hasn't been said already? The movie should have ended long before it did. I thought the movie was almost over when I was only and hour into it. I kept suppressing the urge to walk out, hopeful that the movie would redeem itself and that something remotely exciting would happen. Nothing happened. And when something that was intended to be exciting or interesting or climactic happened, it was impossible to care because of the way it was presented. The acting was wooden, the script long and weak, the direction underwhelming, the editing non-existent, but more than anything; extremely poor home-made video cinematography.The cinematography was fuzzy, shaky, and completely out of focus. Even on dialog shots where the camera should have been flat, it wasn't; this made the scenes shaky and remote. This camera style reminded me of 'Children of Men', except in 'Children of Men' this camera style wasn't bizarrely and ineffectively overused and every other aspect of that movie was strong.Basically, it was a weak movie that only received high ratings due to its all-star cast. I found myself looking at my cell phone for the time what seemed to be every half and hour but was actually only two minutes. That's how slow it was. A colossal waste of time and money.",Null,0,4,5 July 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill-my take
","I was extremely excited to see this movie, because I am starting to get into Quentin Tarantino. I was pleasantly satisfied with this film. From what I understand (although the only other Tarantino movie I've seen is Reservoir Dogs), this movie isn't like his other movies because his other movies capture real life violence, and as Quentin says, 'This is the kind of movie characters in his other movies would go to see.' This is because the characters in his other movies are very violent, and they would want to see movies that are violent in a comic book way (Tarantino is excellent at dramatic sampling, and one of the great things he does in this movie was add an interesting black and white cartoon sequence for Lucy Liu's character). This movie is also divided into sections which also adds to the comic book feel.This is one of those movies where you are constantly being reminded that it's a movie with its comic book feel, whereas with a film like Resorvoir Dogs there is less genre and cinematic sampling and the audience gets the feeling they are watching real life being portrayed on screen. I can't capture my enthrallment with this film. I felt Beatrix 'The Bride' Kiddo's (Uma Thurman) hate throughout. The sound effects and music were very oriental and captured the cinematic and classic 70's Asian feel. One can definitely tell that Quentin is a film geek. There is so much influence in this film: Spaghetti Western, 70's Kung Fu TV show, and some Brian Depalma thrown into the mix. Quentin even says that he takes the best parts from movies he loves; therefore showing the average movie-goer why he has always loved it so much.",10,6,12,1 October 2009
