10 Cloverfield Lane," An amazing movie, don't believe the 1/10 votes!
","First I just want to say, don't believe the low ratings, because people just voted zero, when it turned out this is not Cloverfield 2, a scifi movie from 2008. 10 Cloverfield Lane is nothing like it, and it's a good thing it isn't.10 Cloverfield Lane is (like Cloverfield) produced by J. J. Abrams and directed by Dan Trachtenberg. In the main roles we see John Goodman, who's pretty sure a familiar face to many, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, which I recognized from Die Hards as Lucy, and a bit less known John Gallagher Jr.The movie tells about the triple's survival in the doomsday prepper's bunker, but that's pretty much all I want to say about the story. The whole movie is based on that you know nothing about it before-hand. It can seem a bit of a gamble, but trust me on this one - it won't let you down.The movie is simply brilliant. I like the direction and the shaky hand- held camera of Cloverfield is replaced with tripod scenes, which is good. The use of the camera is amazing, and is one the main elements with which they achieved the claustrophobic and exciting atmosphere of the movie.The story is very thrilling and I watched most of the movie not even leaning back, almost literally hanging on the edge of my seat. The story is very unpredictable and to the last minute you are going to rethink whether you are right, or not. The characters are done and portrayed so well, you change your own opinion back and forth all the time.The acting is also great, especially John Goodman does an awesome job as the doomsday prepper and the character is very interesting. Mary Winstead's character is also good, but mostly I liked the actress' job, as it was surprisingly good.I don't really find that much to complain about, and this is one those movies, that when coming closer to the end, you just think to yourself 'no, don't end ever.' It's exciting, with few even scary scenes, and just simply amazing movie to watch. Even though like 80% of the setting is in underground bunker, it doesn't stop or slow down even for once. The pacing is just a notch on, perfect.I rate it 4,5/5 (or 9/10) - simply because I don't want to raise it among the 'best movies in the world'. Though it was great, you can always improved that one bit more. But, I assure this won't be a disappointment, just as long as you don't go in expecting a Cloverfield- like alien movie with constant explosions and special effects, because this one ain't like that.Thanks for reading, and be sure to check more reviews at http://radioaktiivistajatetta-en.blogspot.com",9,1,2,22 October 2016
The Hateful Eight," Good and well done, but just something's missing
","I thought it was a great movie, but to me it missed something, or it wasn't what I expected.The plot was good and unexpected, but somehow the intensity and tension everyone speaks of didn't get me. I just sat there comfortably waiting, what's to be revealed next. I don't know, maybe I just expected more action.I dialogue was great, probably the best part of the film. The characters were done great and the fact how the viewer got to know little bits about everyone little by little was notch on. The acting of the main characters was as expected - nothing to complain here.In short: I think it was a great movie, fun to watch, I will definitely watch it again. There was just the 'awe-effect' missing: when it ended, it simply ended, I didn't just stay there sitting, fascinated by the movie I just had watched, as a truly awesome movie would.",7,0,1,17 May 2016
Bird Box," Dull and badly executed
","It's okay. The premise was good: some strange creatures that make you want to kill yourself, when you see them, but it was just executed very badly. The premise could have been expanded upon something great, but it turned out to be just yet another A Quiet Place and The Happening.The story is boring, predictable and stretched way too long. With a running time of two hours, it's just a dull watch. The characters were non-memorable, there was no character development. The plot was very straight-forward and I could just guess every coming event. Also the end was very anti-climatic.My biggest concern was the plot holes and just leaving so many things unexplained. Like, what were the creatures? All we see is just wind blowing. What did people see, when they saw the 'creatures'? Why did some go mad and kill themselves, while others went mad and killed others? There was a little hint, that the people not killing themselves had escaped from an asylum, but why? If you're mad already, the creatures just make you homicidal? Why weren't birds (and apparently other animals) affected by the creatures? What happened to the two characters who stole the car? Why did the main characters have to go into the river, when they could have just walked the shoreline? What did the characters eat for 5 years? It's not like they were growing their own food. Why couldn't the creatures come inside buildings?If you can get past things like this, it's fairly watchable, if you have nothing else to do. But if there's some other movie you're interested about, watch that instead.",6,0,3,27 December 2018
Deadpool," A try-hard trying to funny, but ends up being just lame
","Ironically enough, the movie's worst character was Deadpool himself, and the only good parts of the movie were before he was not wearing the red suit.I don't get the hype. The story was lame - let's just say that really, there happened nothing in the movie, but badguys getting kicked in the butt. The action is quite boring, filled with stupid slow-mo's and still images, which were ultimately ruined with the constant yapping and really just irritating jokes by Deadpool. And the 4th wall breaking - geez, it just got so boring, that I wished I could have breaking the wall and yell at him to stop this annoying thing they called movie.I guess the movie was supposed to be fun with the jokes and all, but most of the time I ended up with a facepalm. As said above, ironically the only good parts were the serious ones, which those too were usually ruined at the end by Deadpool saying out loud another lame joke. The whole movie felt like it was scripted and acted by a bunch of teenage kids, who found out that there are funny curse words.The music choices were bad, even though I get their point, but it just doesn't work. Everything in this film that was supposed to be cool and funny, turned out to be lame and just stupid. I just don't get what people see in this.The sexy scenes and blood were just fillers, because, frankly, there was nothing else to the movie. Was it fun to watch? If you left your brains on the doorstep, sure - there are worse movies. But there are also better choices, even if you just want a good laugh, nice action, and a couple of nude girls; this had all those, but only those, and even movies where these are not the main things, you can find better.In the end, I don't know who are supposed to be its audience: surely it's not for any adult that has his brain activity functioning correctly, nor is it for children because of it's gore, sex and repeated use of the f-word. Who is supposed to like this movie?",5,6,14,20 June 2016
Warcraft," Well positively surprising, even for a Warcraft fan
","I think it was awesome. The action was great, and it really kept me hanging on edge of my seat. Even though the story differed somewhat from the games, it was well executed and fitted the movie to make it good.Though, in the other hand the cons of the movie were also the story. At the beginning of the film, the story started out good, but last fourth of the movie was story-wise ruined, in my opinion. It didn't, however, ruin the movie, but knowing the story of the game, it was disappointment. So 80% movie was absolutely great and awesome, but the last 20% story-wise was a huge let down: if you don't know the story of the games, don't read it. Or else the end will be ruined.Overall, apart from the story and ending was just spectacular. The orcs were done amazingly and the movie was just beautiful to watch. The action was breath-taking and keeps excited to the very ending of the movie, though the last battle could have been a little notch closer to a bit more epic, but was still great.TL;DR: It is a must-see in my opinion, a best fantasy action since LotR, and does a good job competing with that. You will love it, if you're a Warcraft fan (apart from few story changes), if you're not, you will love it even more.",8,2,3,10 June 2016
