The Blair Witch Project," popcorn is better
","I have never been to a movie in a long time to see it so filled. I was all hyped up couldn't wait to see this film. It was totally a disappointment to me. I can understand them being so scared lost in the woods it would scare anyone.Especially when you walk for days only to end up nowhere but walking around in circles. I can't understand how you never run across any kind of sort of animal or snake or bird sounds in the woods for days. And always have lit cigarettes but no campfire to keep u warm at night. Being so scared out of your mind and someone is still filming the whole thing,being that scared filming it would be the last thing I would be thinking of. The people in the film did a good job.It was there sense of humor that kept me watching it. As you think ok here it comes it's really going to break loose now you see people still sitting in their seats putting popcorn in their mouths it's over people are looking around at each other and it leaves you in the air to dry.I would of much rather of watched or pay to see Barney goes to New York.",Null,0,1,1 August 1999
