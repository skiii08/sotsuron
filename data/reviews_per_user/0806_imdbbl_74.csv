He is then recruited by the world's most powerful law firm and Kevin and his wife Mary Ann,played by Charlize Teron, move to new york.

Source Code," Entertaining but not great
","Source Code is an action-thriller directed by Duncan Jones (Moon) also starring Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye, Due Date), Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, The Departed), and Jeffrey Wright (Quantum of Solace, Syriana. When decorated soldier Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up in the body of an unknown man, he discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train. In an assignment unlike any he's ever known, he learns he's part of a government experiment called the 'Source Code,' a program that enables him to cross over into another man's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. With a second, much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown Chicago, Colter re-lives the incident over and over again, gathering clues each time, until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the bombs and prevent the next attack.I watch this today and there's no way I can say that it is a bad film. The acting was great and it was damn entertaining. And on top of that, I like sci-fi, specially if there's a human story amidst the action. And this is a film that has the potential to make you reflect about life, reality, philosophy and all that which is great. However, I left the theater feeling a bit disappointed, maybe even cheated? And here's why... In my opinion the film was doomed from the beginning. I'll elaborate; emotionally the ending was quite satisfactory, but in order to have a emotionally satisfactory ending, I feel that the story was compromised. Why was it compromised? Because the ending was too far-fetched. Granted this is sci-fi, you had to suspend your disbelief from the get go but the ending was just too convenient if that makes sense. Even for someone who's somewhat familiarized with multi-verse theory and things like that. It's a bit hard to talk about this film without spoiling it and I don't want to give anything away so, in conclusion, it's probably a film worth seeing for all sci-fi fans but for everyone else it might be just an average piece of work.6.5/10",Null,0,0,23 April 2011
The Hangover," Not even remotely funny
","Doug Billings and Tracy Garner are about to get married. Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug's two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy's brother Alan Garner - hop into Tracy's father's beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn't be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race against time because of Doug's wedding... I really wanted to like this film,I really did.It was extremely talked about,the premise seemed great, it has Vegas as a background and it has Bradley Cooper in it who I really like since he was in Alias(2001).Unfortunately The Hangover was a huge disappointment to me.And don't get me wrong I enjoy a good comedy as much as the next guy but this film is a total and complete disaster.Nothing about it was clever or creative, most of the jokes were just loud,crude and very simple. Nothing even quaint or quirky.I might have smiled a couple of times but I didn't laugh once. There's no point talking about the acting either because with such a poor script no matter how good the acting was the movie would be just as terrible. For me, The Hangover is a huge disappointment and one of the worst comedies of the year despite the high rating and all the hype.4/10",Null,8,17,9 November 2009
United 93," Terrible first hour saved by extremely emotional and gut-wrenching final third
","Four young Arabians prepared themselves physical and spiritually in order to hijack flight United 93, the night before the fatal 11-S-2001. Same day, other three planes were hijacked as well and reached their targets: The World Trade Center and The Pentagon. British director Paul Greengrass gives a close version about what could possible happened inside the plane, basing upon the last recordings from the pilot cabin and the telephone calls made by the passengers to their beloveds. The movie shows how the passengers tried to subdue the terrorists, one of them with a bomb tied to his waist, once they had killed both pilots and one of the passengers. Meanwhile, we see the prevailing crisis in the Air Traffic Control, trying to deal with a situation which leads to close all the country's aerial space. Despite the courage of the passengers, the United Airlines' plane, with an original route to San Francisco, crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, without reaching its target, located in Washington D.C.Watched The Green Zone yesterday, also by Paul Greengrass and decided to check some of his earlier work. United 93 seemed like a good choice even thought I knew it would be hard to watch. I have to say that the first half of the film, which shows the FAA and the military finding out slowly that several planes have been hijacked is extremely dull. I realize they're portraying what happened as best as possible but seeing these two groups (which were completely unprepared) dealing with the situation, looking at radars, using jargon and so forth, does not make for good cinema. It was absolutely excruciating and I nearly gave up on watching United 93. Having said that, the final third of the film which shows a group of passengers rallying up and together conjuring a plan to take over the plane from the hijackers was incredibly well done and extremely emotional. I found myself thinking 'Come on, kill that Mother*****!' as the passengers started to fight the hijackers, such was the emotion of what was being portrayed on the screen. It truly was gut-wrenching. Unfortunately, everyone knows the outcome of this story, the plane crashed, no one survived. Still, what these group of passengers tried to do is nothing short of amazing, and for that sole reason they deserve their story to be told. I wish that instead of what we saw in the first half, Greengrass had shown us perhaps the background of some of this characters, or the simple mundane events in their lives prior to the flight as it would have made for a much better film.6.5/10",Null,1,3,18 June 2010
In Bruges," Extremely funny and refreshing black comedy
","A Christmas story. Should one who killed a child be allowed to live? Harry Waters, a London thug, sends Irish hit men Ken and Ray to Bruges to lie low after a job goes awry in a London church. Ken's the old hand, fascinated by the Medieval, with a fatherly attitude toward Ray, who's young and bored but chastened after the London job. Ray's disposition changes when he meets Chloë, a hip young woman who sells drugs on the local set of a movie featuring Jimmy, an American dwarf. Harry calls with irrevocable instructions. Ken balks, setting up a showdown in the town square. A pregnant innkeeper, dumdum bullets, and a code of conduct play into the resolution...Playwright McDonaugh's debut feature In Bruges can be described as a dramatic and violent black comedy and I have to admit, the last time I laughed this much was when I saw Role Models(2008). In Bruges has to be one of the funniest films of the last years. I didn't laugh until I cried but I did laugh constantly which means the film is very consistent and never looses direction. I've seen some discussion in regards to the humor being either typically British or Irish but honestly, I couldn't care less, it works and that's what matters. Colin Farell plays the role of the young hit-man Ray while Brendan Gleeson is the optimistic and mature Ken. This comedic duo seems an odd match but it works marvelously. Colin Farrel is exceptional as Ray, showing a different side as an actor, he reaches comic heights that I never thought it could. Gleeson was satisfying but definitely out-shined by Farell. And there's Ralph Fiennes who plays the creepy but hilarious Harry, an English thug. The screenplay is full of irony and wit and the beautiful city of Bruges(Belgium) serves as a background for all the crazy action. In Bruges is definitely worth seeing.7.5/10",Null,0,4,25 December 2009
Star Trek," Just another big budget action film
","JJ Abrams last project is one of the most well known franchises out there,Star Trek.I have never seen the original show nor the movies. I only saw a couple of episodes from a 90's spin-off and I was very young. But I am well aware of how famous this franchise is and the huge following it has so I was curious to watch this. The film chronicles the early days of James T. Kirk and the rest of the USS Enterprise crew members... To be honest this is just another big budget action film.It creates an illusion of excitement by having people running around all the time and shooting weapons, gigantic ships firing lasers,black holes destroying planets and what not,but the truth is the story is weak,not that interesting and its been done before. The most interesting part in the movie is the time travel which serves as a plot device,that's something that is always pretty cool and obviously it raises certain questions about different realities and changing the past or the future and that is something that fascinates me. But, I did my research, and apparently time travel has been used several times in the previous movies of this franchise; and even worst then that is the fact that this exactly same plot device is being used RIGHT NOW in the TV show Lost(which I love), a project JJ Abrams is part of; talk about lack of creativity...there are also a few plot holes and clichÃ©s that contribute to the overall poor quality of this flick. Onto the acting, Zachary Quinto wasn't bad as Spock but I don't think this kind of role suits him very well,he's much more comfortable and more importantly,believable, for instance,as the crazy and psychotic Sylar in Heroes.Chris Pine was a pleasant surprise,good performance and, he carried the movie on his back.And then we have Leonard Nimoy with a not so small cameo,who's been doing this character over 40 years.I'm sure the fans were delighted to see him back. From the little I know I don't think the film honored the original show and it hasn't converted me as a fan either...6/10",Null,2,4,24 September 2009
Memento," Unique but slightly overrated...
","I've been trying to watch this movie for ever and finally got a chance to do it. This movie is like a puzzle for you to figure out. Guy Pearce is Leonard, a man who suffers from short-term memory...the last thing he remembers is his wife dying.Now he seeks for revenge and in order to do so, he creates a system, he takes pictures of everyone, he writes down important facts and it gets tattooed with reminders.That's how he copes with his condition. I don't want to give too much away but the way this film is told is pretty unique to say the least and has influenced other movies like The Machinist.That said, Memento is a really good movie and the concept is amazing,the only thing less positive is that it gets a little boring sometimes.I can see why this is on the top250 but it doesn't deserve to be in such high position. 7/10",Null,1,1,26 November 2008
Inglourious Basterds," It's inglorious alright
","In Nazi occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the 'Basterds', a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history...Let me start by saying that despite my love for cinema and the number of films I watch per week, I never payed much attention to Quentin Tarantino's work. I did saw Kill Bill some time ago but I really didn't like it. Having said that, I'm well aware of Tarantino's style and formula and here he presented us with more from the same.The question that ensues is, are you a fan of Tarantino? For someone that enjoyed his previous work this film will probably be a delight; for me, I wouldn't say it was a disappointment, because knowing the kind of films Tarantino does, I was already expecting something among the lines of what I saw but I guess I still had a little bit of hope this film would be different.As I see it, Inglourious Basterds is painfully long and for the most part it feels inert with never ending dialog that isn't really necessary.The acting was completely over the top, specially Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. Despite being known as the pretty boy in Hollywood I consider Brad Pitt to be one of the finest actors out there and he has starred in some of my favorite movies but his acting here is just all over the place.Then again, this is a Tarantino movie, so this is expected. The beautiful Diane Kruger who I usually enjoy watching didn't stood up for me either,I don't know if it was the fact that she spoke German most of the time and I'm used to see her speaking English or if I was just fed up with the movie by then but something was a little off with her.Anyway, as I mentioned before, in the end, it all comes down to a matter of taste,fans of Tarantino will most likely be pleased and non-fans will probably dislike the film. For me, 20 minutes of witty dialog and explicit( and somewhat funny) violence isn't worthy of watching 130 minutes of boring and pointless narrative.6/10",Null,6,11,17 November 2009
Iron Man 2," Disappointingly average
","With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side, must forge new alliances and confront powerful enemies..Iron Man was a breath of fresh air in the super hero genre. While it was still a blockbuster and therefor lacked any true depth, it was fun, entertaining, enjoyable and definitely one notch above anything else we had seen in this category. Iron Man 2, the sequel, doesn't quite follow up. The one thing that remained is the great performance by Robert Downey Jr., he is one of the most charismatic actors today and the role of Tony Stark suits him like a glove. I would go so far as to say he's basically playing himself. Unfortunately, in all the other fronts, the film falls flat. The plot is extremely simplistic, too simple in fact, the new characters, Natalie Rushman, Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer are paper thin and the action sequences, although enjoyable, just aren't impressive at all.Regarding the new additions to the cast, I thought both Don Cheadle and Mickey Rourke did an OK job considering what they had to work with. Scarlett Johansson felt a bit underused. Maybe underused isn't the right word, I just though her character had no real purpose, if anything, she was eye candy. Sam Rockwell was pretty good but again, the material just wasn't that great. Overall, Iron Man 2 is not a terrible film but it's pretty inferior to its predecessor and nothing more then your typical summer blockbuster.6/10",Null,0,1,5 September 2010
Public Enemies," Depp is great, the film not so much
","The difficult 1930s is a time of robbers who knock over banks and other rich targets with alarming frequency. Of them, none is more notorious than John Dillinger, whose gang plies its trade with cunning efficiency against big businesses while leaving ordinary citizens alone. As Dillinger becomes a folk hero, FBI head J. Edger Hoover is determined to stop his ilk by assigning ace agent Melvin Purvis to hunt down Dillinger. As Purvis struggles with the manhunt's realities, Dillinger himself faces an ominous future with the loss of friends, dwindling options and a changing world of organized crime with no room for him... Michael Mann's Public Enemies is a very mediocre piece of work. First and foremost, I think the viewers will be surprised by the ' look' of the film. Apparently it was shot in HD/digital video which should mean a sharp image but the end result is still and lifeless. The sound is also very odd as if it hasn't been worked at all. Both questionable choices by the director. The story feels rushed and loose and the narrative isn't focused which is a shame because this is an interesting and compelling story that could have been made into a great film. Another flaw is the fact that besides John Dillinger and Billie Frechette, all the other characters are two-dimensional and poorly written. The best thing about Public Enemies, is undeniably, Johnny Depp. He is terrifically charismatic, stylish and suave as Dillinger and a pleasure to watch. The role fitted him like a glove, and without Depp the film would have almost no interest. Marion Cotillard was lovely as Billie Frechette, on the other hand, Christian Bale was very wooden as Melvin Purvis, the man in charge of hunting down Dillinger and his gang, resembling his performance in his latest film, Terminator Salvation. Overall, I think Michael Mann is to blame, Public Enemies seemed to have all the right ingredients to be an epic gangster film however, the director made some odd choices and I question his vision. And according to rumors, so did Depp. Maybe, it was their disagreement that caused the film to be so uneven.6/10",Null,0,1,11 December 2009
Superbad," Not superbad but definitely not that great either
","Superbad came out over 3 years ago but I guess it's better to watch something later then to never watch it. I heard a lot about and it is clearly THE film that launched Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, Emma Stone and it kinda revamped the comedic genre and gave super stardom status to Judd Apatow, who served as producer.It revolves around two co-dependent high school seniors (Hill and Cera) who set out to score alcohol for a party, believing that girls will then hook up with them and they will be ready for college. But as the night grows more chaotic, overcoming their separation anxiety becomes a greater challenge than getting the girls.To tell the truth, I was a bit disappointed by Superbad. Maybe disappointed isn't the right word because I wasn't expecting something that great, after all, great comedies are few and in between but since there was so much talk about it and since it was so well received by the critics, I was expecting something at least one notch above most comedies.Now, I'll admit that Superbad has some truly hilarious moments but these are undermined by the usual raunchy jokes and the very flimsy story lines. When it works, it really works but when it doesn't, it stinks. For instance, the bit with the 2 cops, played by Bill Hader and Seth Rogen was so silly, so over the top, it just wasn't funny at all and worst then that, it went on for way too long. The acting was actually pretty good, and the entire cast did a good job with Jonah Hill really standing out.Now, don't get me wrong, Superbad is a perfectly nice film to watch if you want to have a laugh but it is far from having reinvented the genre.6/10",Null,1,3,25 September 2010
Constantine," Lack of ambition
","John Constantine is a supernatural detective and an exorcist who teams up with Angela Dodson, a policewoman to investigate the suicide of Angela's twin sister.The action occurs in earth and in hell as Constantine fights demons and tries to change his fate...I'm not familiar with the comic book Constantine is based on but I love the premise.I love the story,I love the main character,I love the duality between earth and hell, good and evil,angels and demons and so on.However the movie disappointed me. Even tough there are quite a few action scenes and lots of amazing special effects I felt bored at times.It just wasn't that interesting.Constantine could have been an epic movie.I mean, I can't think of a subject more epic then this one, it almost seems like the director wasn't ambitious enough and settled for some great gci and a boring story.He should have written an argument of epic proportions,something larger then life.Onto the positive things, as I said before the gci was in fact very good and the acting was amazing,Peter Stormare,Tilda Swinton,Rachel Weisz, even Gavin Rossdale had a good presence.Shia Labeouf and Djimon Honsou were good but not great. But the star was obviously Keanu Reeves. Great performance.He seems to be really good at playing this kind of flawed,chosen heroes(see Neo in Matrix).6/10",Null,0,2,3 September 2009
Terminator Salvation," Milking the cow
","Terminator Salvation is the 4th film in the 'Terminator Franchise' and serves as a direct sequel to the previous three movies - The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003). The premise is simple,after Skynet has destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, a group of survivors led by John Connor struggles to keep the machines from finishing the job. Not so simple, as the fans know, is the overall story of the franchise which has time traveling as main device.Obviously there are a few paradoxes and every time a new terminator movie is released, things get a bit more complicated,a bit more far-fetched and inconsistencies start to show. I could easily see past that if the only problem of the movie were this minor flaws but that's not the case... The cgi and the special effects are good as expected but the actions scenes in Terminator Salvation are over the top and unrealistic,the main characters get thrown around,beat, they fall from awful highs and nothing serious ever happens to them. I know this is a film, but there has to be a limit ,otherwise it becomes ridiculous and turns into a circus.Regarding the acting, Anton Yelchin was great( as he always is) in the role of the young Kyle Reese and same thing goes for Sam Worthington who played the death row inmate turned into terminator Marcus Wright.Christian Bale on the other hand was a total disaster. He seemed more of a machine then the machines his character was fighting. Unable to convey any kind of emotion, he delivered a truly one-dimensional performance which is kind of a disappointment because he has proofed several times his value as an actor. Overall, I think this film shouldn't have been made. This franchise keeps being revived only because its still bankable when the only reason to do so should be because there's still a story worth telling or a direction worth exploring.6/10",Null,0,0,1 December 2009
500 Days of Summer," 'This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is not a love story.'
","What's so great about 500 Days Of Summer is that unlikely most romantic comedies it depicts real life, where not everything goes according to plan,where bad things do happen and people do suffer. The premise is quite simple: Summer Finn,played by Zooey Deschanel, doesn't believe in true love, and Tom Hansen,played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who does believe,falls for her.Obviously this can't go well. Despite the constant warnings by Summer that she isn't looking for anything serious and does not want a commitment, Tom falls deeper in love with her everyday and as the time goes by the two of them become lovers.However, when asked about it,Summer refuses to put a label on their relationship which leaves Tom with a feeling of unease.One day Summer leaves and Tom is left wondering,how the hell can he move on? The story is presented in a non-chronological format which is the first thing that really makes the film stand out, the way it was edited was absolutely brilliant.Zooey Deschanel gave a solid performance but was definitely out shined by Joseph Gordon-Levitt,who for me is an amazing actor yet very underrated.He's not your typical Hollywood heartthrob leading man but there's something very unique and special about him.The film also has a killer soundtrack, and I really mean it,the songs are beautiful and fit the scenes(and the general ambiance)perfectly! One of the few things I didn't like so much was the ending,I don't want to spoil it but it is kind of an happy ending that doesn't feel consistent with the rest of the movie.It doesn't feel very honest.With a different ending this movie could have been almost perfect.Regardless, 500 Days Of Summer is an refreshing movie with two good performances(mainly Joseph Gorden-Levitt) that shows the sweet and sour aspects of romance and deserves to be seen.8/10",Null,0,2,20 September 2009

The magicians obsession in topping one another and the extreme lengths they go to do so, make this rivalry very interesting to watch.The story is full of twists and turns,most of them unexpected.Both Jackman and Bale delivered good performances and the movie was well directed.Near the end answers are provided to the two biggest secrets in the movie but they might not please everyone.I guessed one of the answers but the other one, I never saw it coming and some might feel cheated.

I really can't understand how this movie has such a high rating.I guess all the nerds are voting. I tried to enjoy this movie...but its just not possible.

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Doesn't do it for me
","After hard years in exile for a crime he didn't commit, Benjamin Barker, now Sweeney Todd, returns to London to find his wife dead and his daughter in the hands of the evil Judge Turpin. In his anger, Sweeney goes on a murderous rampage on all London. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, he opens a barber shop in which he lures his victims with a charming smile before casually ending their lives with a flick of his razor across their necks. But not one man nor ten thousand men killed can satisfy Sweeney's lust for vengeance on those who've caused his years of pain... Sweeney Todd is a dark musical fantasy that marks the reunion of Tim Burton and Johny Depp. The lead character is obviously played by Depp and Mrs.Lovett is played by Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter. The film is based on the Sondheim musical thus the dialog being sung to music. The main and supporting cast, all did a good job but obviously, Depp stands out for being so charismatic. On a side note, the film is very graphic with closeup shots of throats being slit and huge amounts of blood, I wasn't slightly bothered by it, but it's not a film for the squeamish. Despite the use of mute colors, visually, the film is stunning, with gorgeous sets and extremely well made costumes. To be honest, I'm not a fan of musicals, it's a genre that doesn't do anything for me, but for those who actually enjoy them Sweeney Todd will probably be a treat.6/10",Null,0,2,21 December 2009
Burn After Reading," Brilliant dark comedy
","I just watched Coen Brother's latest film, and what a surprise. As I read somewhere this movie is about nothing at all and the premise is almost an excuse to make a movie.A great movie may I add...Burn After Reading is a dark comedy which purpose is nothing more then to entertain, and this is entertainment at his best.Obviously the A-list actors push the movie to a different level. George Clooney plays (again), a charming womanizer but this time with a little twist, he's a bit paranoid and obsessed with sex. Frances McDormand does a hell of a job as the 40's gym employee who needs a ton of cosmetic surgeries in order to reinvent herself, and John Malkovich although he doesn't get that much screen time, he did well as the government worker and his 'wtf' is priceless.But as I see it, Brad Pitt is the star of the movie,all his scenes are hilarious and who knew he could do comedy like this? He is one of the most accomplished actors I know and one of the most underrated as well, and I think he can pull off any type of role.In the end as the CIA superior says, 'we learned nothing'... but we sure as hell were entertained.8/10",Null,1,4,28 October 2008
Knowing," Typical Hollywood Stuff
","In the 50's an entire class of students made drawings of what they thought the future would look like and proceeded to place them into a time capsule meant to be open in 50 years time. Instead of drawing something,Lucinda,one of the girls from the class,wrote a series of numbers which were whispered into her head by something/someone.Fast forward 50 years and the story continues in the present day with the time capsule being open.The drawings are handed to the kids who attend the school, among them, the paper filled with numbers written by Lucinda which is given to Caleb, one of the students.Nicholas Cage plays John Koestler, the father of Caleb who later stumbles upon this paper.John starts to decipher the numbers and much to his surprise the numbers seem to indicate the date and the location where catastrophes have occurred in the last 50 years. And also how many people died in each event. Three events haven't take place yet and now John makes his mission to try and stop them from happening.As the story moves forward we get the feeling that something in a large scale is going on and as the tension rises there's also a building sense of doom and truth is, it kinda works,the movie,altought very unoriginal, entertains the viewer.The problem of this flick, for me, is the fact that as a viewer you long for answers and when they finally come the film turns into a major let down. In other words, the ending is terrible. It almost seems like the screenwriters didn't know what to do with the rest of the story and thought: what the hell, we might as well go with the aliens stuff.And so, in the end,the individuals we see whispering throughout the whole film are revealed as some sort of hybrid between an angel and an extraterrestrial being and since our planet is about to get destroyed by a solar flare they choose a couple of children and then they leave our planet in their fancy space shift and take the kids to an inhabited planet where mankind can start over.Very Adam and Eve sort of thing.Honestly I couldn't have been more disappointed with the ending,I enjoy alien stuff as much as the next guy but we can't have that in every single movie now, can we? And also the film seemed to be more about destiny versus fate,determinism vs randomness,the ending for me, felt out of place and contrived.Typical Hollywood stuff.Regarding the acting I think Nicholas Cage's performance was below par. I know he's suppose to play this sad and depressed widower but the feeling I got was that he thought he was doing a favor to all of us by playing this character.He performance was almost hard to watch.My advice is skip the film.6/10",Null,0,1,14 October 2009

It's NOT the new matrix, but as far as attempts go, this is the best so far. There is obviously some things in common. Again you'll see some random looser discovering he has amazing skills and he is not just an ordinary man, and then he struggles to find his path. The thing is, Matrix was not only special effects and slow motion ,the concept was amazing, the duality between real and fiction, and the idea that maybe what we're experiencing is not real was revolutionary and fresh.The Matrix is a mark in the history of cinema both visually and conceptually. Wanted has the visual, but the plot,its just OK, it doesn't blow us away and there are some plot holes along the ride. Still, Wanted is a really good movie,the narration was a good option(Fightclub anyone?)and the dark humor made me crack several times, this is the way to put comedy into action. The special effects are obviously amazing, its all done very stylishly, James McAvoy excels in this role, Morgan Freeman was casted just to draw more people to see the movie because he has like 10 lines, and boy, do i love the new look of Angelina.She looks like a skinny drug addict with huge amounts of eye shadow...but a really hot one! And she has that 'cool attitude' you just can't get enough. Many people are saying Wanted is forgettable, well probably, but only because the matrix came first. If you are looking for the perfect movie, a masterpiece, this is not for you. This is an action packed movie with great special effects, great leading actor,lots of humor and all this put together very nicely.",Null,1,3,30 July 2008
Salt," Tour-de-force by Jolie makes Salt watchable
","CIA agent Evelyn Salt interrogates a Russian defector, Orlov, who tells her about 'Day X', an operation organized by a powerful Russian since the Cold War, which will lead to the destruction of the United States. Orlov mentions that at the funeral of the late Vice President in New York City, the visiting Russian President will be killed by Russian spy Evelyn Salt. Salt, shaken at the accusation, attempts to contact her husband Mike, a German arachnologist, fearing for his safety. Meanwhile, Orlov escapes, prompting Salt to escape — causing the CIA to think she is a spy but is she? And if so what are her motifs ? I was looking forward to watching Salt, I really like the spy genre even tough it's hard to find a great film in that category and, when I saw the trailer, I was instantly reminded of Jennifer Garner in the amazing TV show Alias. It seemed right up my alley. Something about sexy girls kicking ass, maybe? Unfortunately, Salt disappointed me. Not that it's a terrible film but it's average at best. The premise is great and holds a lot of potential but it evolves into something completely ridiculous and over the top. The plot is so flimsy, so far-fetched that, if you're going into this film expecting a smart, well-constructed story, then you're going to be just as disappointed as me. I'm not even going to talk about that final scene. See it and judge for yourself.I have to say that regarding the action, the film delivers in spades. There's plenty of chases, stunts, fighting sequences and so forth. And for the most part it was all very nicely choreographed; there's a bit of cgi in the mix and the usual cuts but still, it looks great. And so does Jolie. Not only does she look gorgeous but she did a terrific job considering all the physical stuff she had to do, and overall, she delivered a strong performance. Granted, it's not enough to make this into a great film but Jolie may very well be the reason why Salt is watchable.6/10",Null,9,19,20 August 2010
Disturbia," Tense and entertaining
","Disturbia stars LaBeouf as the troubled Kale, who is confined to his home under house arrest after he punches out his Spanish teacher in the middle of class. Kale's array of available diversions dwindle considerably after his mom (Carrie Ann Moss) shuts off his X-Box and his i-Tunes, and he turns to voyeurism instead, carefully noting the daily activities of his neighbors. These include the swimming schedule of the hot girl who just moved in next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), whom he ogles with his best friend, the class clown, Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). When Ashley unexpectedly shows up and wants to know what the boys are doing behind their binoculars, they concoct a story about their neighbor, Mr. Turner (David Morse), and their suspicions that he is the serial killer currently on the loose... Disturbia seems to be a modern take on Hitchcock's 'Rear Window which I haven't seen but I plan to, because this little thriller was very enjoyable. The story is pretty straightforward and somewhat predictable, and truth be told, it could use a twist or two but, thanks to a good direction, the atmosphere is always very tense and suspenseful and keeps the viewer engaged and on the edge of the seat. Shia LaBeouf delivered a very effective and charismatic performance as Kale and this was one of the films that helped him become the star he is today. In the end, Disturbia is nothing groundbreaking, but it's a nicely done thriller and an entertaining film.6.5/10",Null,1,2,12 January 2010
Being John Malkovich," Craziness
","Being John Malkovich is one of the weirdest,craziest movies I have ever seen and I've seen a fair share of 'unusual movies'.The story revolves around Craig Schwartz,played by John Cusack, a puppeteer who discovers a portal that leads to head of the famous actor John Malkovich who is indeed a famous actor in real life; so, right there the movie begins playing with perceptions.Schwartz and his colleague, Maxine turn this portal into a small business. For 200 dollars one can go trough the portal and be John Malkovich for 15 minutes experiencing,feeling and seeing whatever Malkovich does.Schwartz wife,Lotte,portrayed by Cameron Diaz finds out about the scheme and decides to go trough the portal as well.She is blown away by the experience and repeats it several times. At the same time Maxine meets in person with Malkovich(obviously played by the real John Malkovich) and begins a relationship with him, but truly, she is in a relationship with Lotte who keeps passing trough the portal therefor being John Malkovich.Maxine feels Lotte trough Malkovich and even calls him by that name.Schwartz, enraged by this relation tries to control Malkovich permanently in order to gain the affection of Maxine who never responded to his interest.The plot of the film is weird,odd,strange,peculiar and absolutely bizarre and as the story moves forward things get weirder and weirder.Its definitely an original movie but honestly, I didn't like it very much.The movie stumbles between several genres, sometimes it seems a science fiction piece,sometimes a fantasy tale,its a bunch of craziness in which there's no common denominator,there's no grip to reality so to speak,even within fantasy there's gotta be some sense, some reasoning, well,at least for me. I felt the story was something a person can only imagine/conceive while on a drug trip.It is that crazy.On a more positive note,John Malkovich delivered a good performance. Being John Malkovich is a very peculiar film but the truth is I think its weirdness is being mistaken by genius after all originality means its never been done before, doesn't mean something is good.I find it very overrated.I also think you must have a certain predisposition to these kind of films to enjoy this flick.Its definitely not for me.5/10",Null,0,1,13 October 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," A big mess
","A reporter, trying to lose himself in the romance of war after his marriage fails, gets more than he bargains for when he meets a special forces agent who reveals the existence of a secret, psychic military unit whose goal is to end war as we know it. The founder of the unit has gone missing and the trail leads to another psychic soldier who has distorted the mission to serve his own ends...What do you get when you combine comedy, drama, sci-fi and action ? Usually a big mess. Despite the presence of great actors like Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey, this is not a good film by any means. Describing The Man who Stare at goats is not an easy task; first and foremost, the story is as bizarre as silly and convoluted. There's no real sense or purpose, and absolutely no direction. That alone makes this film an unpleasant experience. Also, a lot happens in the film and yet it manages to be one of the most boring and dull comedies of 2009. I don't even understand how this film can be categorized as a comedy because there's no humor at all. None. Zero. I know it sounds harsh but it's just impossible to laugh at this stuff unless you're 10. The film is not funny, clever or entertaining. There's a lot of positive reviews for the film but my advice is give it a miss.4/10",Null,14,23,7 March 2010
Jarhead," Pointless
","Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford, a kid from Sacramento, enlists in the Marines in the late 1980s. He malingers during boot camp, but makes it through as a sniper, paired with the usually-reliable Troy. The Gulf War breaks out, and his unit goes to Saudi Arabia for Desert Shield. After 175 days of boredom, adrenaline, heat, worry about his girl-fiend finding someone else, losing it and nearly killing a mate, demotion, latrine cleaning, faulty gas masks, and desert football, Desert Storm begins. In less than five days, it's over, but not before Swoff sees burned bodies, flaming oil derricks, an oil-drenched horse, and maybe a chance at killing... Jarhead is one of the most pointless movies I have ever seen,it's empty and hollow and there is absolutely no development.The film shows Swofford and the rest of the marines stranded in the desert, 'fighting' an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully comprehend. Nothing goes on and the marines have to entertain themselves and keep a grip on reality. Jarhead is based on a book written by former Marine Anthony Swofford's where he describes his pre-Desert Storm experiences in Saudi Arabia and his experiences fighting in Kuwait.Now; while I can accept that the events (or lack of of events) that we see in the film did in fact happen, and that this is in fact, the other side of war that many of us don't know, I don't understand what's the point of this film.Jarhead portrays the marines as a bunch of dumb foul-mouthed sex-crazed drunk idiots who were trained by stupid and sadistic leaders and I don't think that's a fair image. As everywhere else I'm sure there are jerks in the marines but I'm pretty sure there is some good people as well. I'm not a marine neither do I know anyone who is and I'm not saying that I endorse the war,I just don't think that this is a fair portrayal of this people.On top of all of this in the end,Swofford says that war veterans never truly readjusts to civilian life and that they'll feel like marines for the rest of their lives. While I'm sure this is true,at least to some extent,Swofford did not killed one man, faced one enemy or shot a single bullet.He didn't experienced war in a single bit.What he went trough is the same as camping with a bunch of kids for months and now in the end he's saying that he can't let go of it? Oh the irony. On a more positive note,there are some interesting sites like the desert with the burning oil wells in the horizon and the movie does benefit from two good performances,both Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard as Swofford and Troy, but I just can't see past the lack of meaning of the story.6/10",Null,1,3,1 December 2009
Collateral," Effective thriller
","Jamie Fox is Max, an ordinary cab driver with dreams and aspirations of starting a business,one night he finds himself the hostage of a contract killer,Vincent, portrayed by Tom Cruise.Vincent forces Max to drive him around while he kills the targets on his list one by one.Meanwhile Detective Fanning(Mark Ruffalo) is investigating the death of one of his informants.Later Max he's able to escape only to find out that Vincent's last victim is a female client(Jada Pinkett Smith) that Max drove hours later.This thriller/film-noir that takes place in Los Angeles will captivate you from the early beginning.The plot is very interesting and the pace is great.The main theme is probably the clash of ideas and lifestyles between the two main characters; while Max waits for things to happen,Vincent forces them to happen,while Max has a perfectly sheduled routine,Vincent never knows where he's going to be in the next ten minutes.Tom Cruise's performance was perfect and you can't help but love Vincent even him being a sociopath.I think the Oscar nomination should had gone to him and not to Jamie Fox.Don't get me wrong, Fox did a good job but he was definitely out shadowed by Cruise's brilliance.Javier Bardem makes a small cameo so pay attention to that. In my opinion Collateral is Michael Mann's best movie and one of the finest thrillers in the last decade. 8.5/10",Null,1,1,11 January 2009
The Machinist," Fantastic but not for everyone...
","Wow.What the...? Wow! That was my reaction to this movie. The Machinist is about a lonely sometimes ostracized industrial worker who suffers from insomnia and hasn't slept in a year.Soon he finds it hard to distinguish what is real and what is fiction and becomes tormented.I really can't say anything else without spoiling the movie... The Machinist has this weird, dark feel to it and was heavy influenced by Memento,if you like those kind of movies, then by all means, watch this. Nonetheless this is a very original film.Christian Bale's performance is mesmerizing and hands down, I have never seen such dedication to a role, he really got into it and the weight he lost is proof of it. We need more directors thinking outside the box. 8/10",Null,0,0,24 November 2008
No Strings Attached," Portman is great, the rest not so much
","In this comedy, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) are life-long friends who almost ruin everything by having sex one morning. In order to protect their friendship, they make a pact to keep their relationship strictly 'no strings attached.' 'No strings' means no jealousy, no expectations, no fighting, no flowers, no baby voices. It means they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, in whatever public place they want, as long as they don't fall in love. The questions become - Can you have sex without love getting in the way? And can their friendship survive? Now, let me start this by saying that I'm a huge fan of Natalie Portman. She's, in my opinion, the best actress out there, by a long shot. Every film she's in is that much better because of her and she has given some amazing performances throughout her career. Suffice to say I have seen everything she has done so far and felt obliged to watch No Strings Attached as well. However, I had really low expectations for this film. Let's be honest, comedies usually suck, let alone romantic comedies starring Ashton Kutcher. Honestly, I was entertained by the film but it's your run of the mill rom-com. The plot is extremely predictable, the jokes for the most part are silly, childish and not clever at all, and the film uses the same formula of every comedy that has come from Hollywood in the last decade. There's even the goofy sidekick to provide comic relief.Regarding the acting I thought Kutcher did an OK job but he never truly gives himself into the character. In short he was a bit wooden. Portman on the other hand, can do no wrong. I think the reason why I was able to somewhat enjoy the film was definitely her presence and with any other actress this film would have been much worse. All in all, it's a formulaic rom-com that benefits from one of its lead actors but it's still a very weak effort.6.5/10",Null,1,5,2 May 2011
Tropic Thunder," Flawed but so funny...
","This film is good but could have been much better.Tugg Speedman, Kirk Lazarus, Kevin Sandusky and Alpa Chino are a group of four prima donna actors who are shooting a war movie.After a series of strange events they realize their enemies are very real and they must become real soldiers in order to avoid getting killed... Tropic Thunder has some great moments and some of the funniest jokes I've seen in a while but it doesn't always work.There's a thin line between good satirical comedy and lame jokes and Ben Stiller doesn't always make the best choices. That said you'll probably laugh hard every five minutes or so because the movie has a good pace.We got a stellar cast here...Ben Stiller(who wrote,directed and starred),Jack Black,Robert Downey Jr,Mathew McConaughey and Tom Cruise. RDJ and Tom Cruise are definitely worth mentioning, they were both hilarious!! RDJ just went all for it,he really got into the character and there's even Oscar buzz. Tom Cruise was also immensely praised for his portrayal of Les Grossman and his scenes are by far the funniest.The 'flaming dragon' scene is probably the funniest scene in movie history.If you're in for a laugh give Tropic Thunder a try.7/10",Null,0,1,3 January 2009
Quantum of Solace," Good Bond installment...with some flaws
","Bond films are definitely taking a new direction...and I'm liking it. But not everyone is reacting well to this new era, probably because many are used to the old Bond's mannerisms and attitudes. I personally think its great to see a more modern and contemporary Bond and also don't forget, both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace take place before all the other movies so Bond's character is still being shaped.The good news is that Bond is still Bond and despite all the criticism no one has ever played this character so well as Daniel Craig.He actually did pretty much all the stunts himself which I think its amazing.It shows how much he cares and how much he wants to please the fans.The plot is probably the biggest flaw here...there's a 'big conspiracy' as usual but its overcomplicated and not that interesting.I was expecting something a little better taking into consideration that Quantum of Solace was written by Paul Haggis, the writer of so many Oscar winning pictures in the last years.The film is very entertaining though which is its main purpose. The bond girl is played this time by the lovely Olga Kurylenko and I must say I wasn't certain she was bond Girl material but she proved me wrong and it was interesting to see her character's seek for revenge.The villain, played by Mathieu Amalric, doesn't quite live up to the expectations though ...and was rather disappointing, after all this is a Bond film and usually the villains are almost as iconic as Bond itself. Judie Dench returns as 'M' and thank god,there's no sign of 'Q'. Bottom line: Quantum of Solace is a solid movie and a nice addiction to the Bond series and Daniel Craig is the greatest James Bond to this date.Sorry Sean!8/10",Null,1,6,20 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," What's so special about it ?
","After stumbling across a case of money among dead bodies, Llewelyn Moss thinks he can keep it quiet, but when silent killer Anton Chigurh locates Moss and his money, Vietnam veteran Moss makes a run for it. With bodies falling everywhere Anton goes, it's only a matter of time before he catches up with Llewelyn. Whilst all this is going on, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is overseeing the investigation and begins to see the country in a different light than it once was...No Country For Old Man was critically acclaimed, won 4 Oscars and (supposedly) established Joel and Etan Coen as two of the best directors of today, but I fail to see the brilliance in this film. I don't think this is a good film, let alone be considered one of the best movies of all time. I find the film to be extremely pretentious and overrated. Both Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem deliver great performances,specially the last as a blood-cold psychopathic killer with some bad ass weapons but in dire need of an haircut, but if you put that aside, then what do we got here? A simple western-thriller. A chase between a killer and its prey. What's so special about it ? I'll say this; the cinematography is good, but that alone plus two good performances doesn't make a great movie. I mean, what is it, what is seducing the critics and everyone in general? Is the southern accent? Is the tension and the violence caused by Anton? Well, I have no idea but for me No Country For Old Men is below average. There's nothing great about it, there's nothing special about it. Its a pretty straight-forward thriller that happens to take place in Texas.6/10",Null,2,4,4 December 2009
District 9," Don't believe the hype
","The fact that this movie is already on IMDb's top 250 and on such a high position is surreal.It goes to show you what hype can do for a movie and unfortunately it also shows that IMDb is losing credibility. District 9 tells the story of an extraterrestrial race that arrived at our planet in the 80's.These aliens are since then forced to live in slums and they have to withstand terrible conditions of living. Man have named this place District 9 and it holds more then a million aliens.The movie starts in a documentary-style showing what is happening in the slums and what is the opinion of several individuals about this aliens.Then the film focus on a government agent who was exposed to the aliens biotechnology...First of all, there are a ton of plot-holes,and I'm not talking about little things,these are major aspects of the plot that affect the story in a large scale. I do like the science fiction genre and I always go into these movies with an open-mind but when things just don't make sense its hard to enjoy a movie. Even Sci fi movies have to have some coherence and logic. District 9 is also filled with clichés. From the mother ship who looks exactly like the ship in Independence day to the aliens who look like insectoids.I mean, this has been done so many times.Break the mold already.Also the storyline of the government agent helping one of the aliens, so that he can help him in return isn't really that interesting to be honest....I think that if the director had chosen to focus on the coexistence of humans and aliens for instance and the possible struggle between the two races this movie could have been somewhat interesting and more importantly, original. Don't believe the hype,District 9 is just another summer blockbuster, lots of explosions, noise and gci but little interest,no substance and no originality whatsoever.6/10",Null,5,9,5 September 2009

The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford tries to humanize and de-mythologize Jesse James and at the same time show who Robert Ford truly was. Jesse was not really a hero and Ford was not an evil person.Both are often perceived as something they were not. This is a beautiful movie.

28 Days Later...," Nice British post-apocalyptic tale
","28 Days Later is a British post-apocalyptic horror/science fiction film that depicts the breakdown of society following the accidental release of a highly contagious virus and focuses upon the struggle of four survivors to cope with the ruination of the life they once knew. Although a critical and commercial success, I only got the chance to watch this today. I was quite surprised with this film. The director Danny Boyle, who is now best known for the multiple Oscar winning film, Slumdog Millionaire, showed a very interesting and unique vision. His post-apocalyptic tale borrows some elements from other films but at the same time its like no other. The first act is definitely the best; a disorientated Jim (Cilian Murpy) wakes up in the hospital only to find out that he's alone. There's not one single person in the hospital or outside. Jim has no idea of what happen or of what's going on and as he wanders in the streets we get to see several shots of a deserted London accompanied by atmospheric instrumental music and it makes for a very cool and effective scene. At some point Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomi Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley).They break it down to Jim, a contagious virus was accidentally released and most of the population is either infected or dead. The infected ( they're basically zombies ) show no sign of human behavior and only care about killing. Later on Mark gets killed and Jim and Selena are joined by Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). The four of them desperately try to stay alive and after hearing a transmission on the radio they decide to go to Manchester where supposedly are a group of survivors. There is some violence and gore, but apart from a scene towards the end, nothing too strong or particularly disgusting. Cilian Murphy is tremendous as the lead character and he's the only actor worth mentioning because the others don't get that much screen time or attention. The film reminds me a lot of The Last Man On Earth, and the third act, which involves some moral dilemmas, reminds me a bit of Blindness but, remember, both this films came after Boyle's film. Overall, 28 Days Later is an original, tense and thrilling film with a very unique vision.7/10",Null,2,4,5 December 2009
2012," Entertainment for the brain-dead masses
","In Roland Emmerich's latest film, the world is coming to an end just as the ancient civilization of the Mayans predicted. In their famous calendar the world ends in 2012 due to a global cataclysm.And that's exactly what happens in this film. Small signs start to show in 2009 and it all happens in full force by the 21 of December of 2012. The earth starts to crumble,cities collapse,the sea emerges,tsunamis start to form,volcanoes erupt, all kinds of natural disasters you can think of. And that is pretty much the story here. In the middle of all this is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), the everyday man who is trying to save his loved ones, his ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and their two young kids. But to be honest, who cares? The central point of the movie is the on going disaster and therefor the characters are paper-thin and uninteresting. Now,obviously the cgi is good and the movie is all about the eye candy but the action is very silly,over the top and implausible.How many times can the main characters fly between falling buildings without getting hit?? How many coincidences and luck-outs does this boring broken family have? It doesn't help that with the exception of Amanda Peet who looked genuinely afraid and concerned, all the other actors did a terrible, let me re-enforce that, TERRIBLE job. John Cusack seemed completely lost and his dialog was as sappy as it can get, Danny Glover's portrayal of an American President was cringe-worthy ,Chiwetel Ejiofor who played Adrian Helmsley, the geologist helping the white house, was clearly an actor acting if you know what I mean, Thandie Newton( she played the President's daughter) was probably one of the worst despite her having the least lines and Hoody Harrelson failed completely at being the comedy relief. In fact, there shouldn't even exist a comedy relief at all; this is the end of the world and the writers are trying to make us laugh and break the tension? It just makes impossible for someone to take the film seriously. Also the film was painfully long, they could have easily cut 30 minutes of footage and it would have made for a better film. If you want to see a visual spectacle, then 2012 is definitely for you, if you're looking for something else( which most people are I hope) skip it. Bottom line is, never the end of the world looked so boring and silly.5/10",Null,3,4,3 December 2009

","After a vicious storm wreaks havoc in their small town in Maine, artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) heads out to the town supermarket for some much-needed supplies with his young son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor, Norton (Andre Braugher), in tow. Their trip soon turns to terror when a menacing white mist settles in, leaving this group of locals and out-of-towners fighting for survival against an unknown, bloodthirsty enemy. When the local religious zealot (Marcia Gay Harden) begins to convince the group that the mist is punishment from God, Drayton and his cohorts realize that they may be trapped inside with an enemy just as dangerous as whatever is lurking outside. Tension runs high in this tale as the trapped group faces difficult moral decisions. Should they stay and wait out the terror, or make a break for it and risk suffering a terrible fate? The Mist is an incredibly bland film. There's that mysterious atmosphere and a little bit of tension because of the unknown but nothing really that excites you. The film also has this claustrophobic sensation, not because the action takes place in the same spot during the entire film but because the plot is always the same. There's all kinds of nasty cgi monsters, some little, some big, some with wings, some with tentacles and then there's the group of civilians who have to defend themselves and this goes on for more then an hour. Plus, the film isn't scary at all, more disgusting and nasty then anything else. At one point the film turns into a morality play but by then I was completely exhausted and fed up.The acting was solid and the film was well directed, but as I said, the script (which is inspired by a Stephen King novella) doesn't do anything for me. We've seen this kind of story hundreds of times, it's just not that effective anymore, at least for me.5/10",Null,2,5,24 June 2010
I Am Legend," Well thought and well made
","Robert Neville is a scientist who was unable to stop the spread of the terrible virus that was incurable and man-made. Immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and perhaps the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague,the infected,lurk in the shadows... watching Neville's every move... waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered and quickly running out of time...The novel 'I Am Legend' by Richard Matheson, which I haven't read, must be a hell of a book because this is the third adaptation to film that has been made so far.I didn't watch The Last Man On Earth(1964) neither The Omega Man(1971) and therefor I really can't make comparisons. As a stand-alone piece of work (which is probably how this film should be seen),I think I Am Legend is a very solid film and a great addiction to its genre.The film is highly entertaining although I'm sure,many will complain about the slow pace,which is nonsense because,the story unveils very nicely and watching Robert Neville,played by Will Smith, wandering around trough the streets of a deserted yet beautiful New York City with his faithful companion, a German shepherd called Samantha, is a pleasure and quite frankly, doesn't get boring. Even watching Neville's daily routine is interesting.And even more satisfying is watching Neville dealing with extreme loneliness and how he desperately attempts not to go insane. Trough brief flashbacks were also shown what happen to Neville's family and how the chaos in the city started.Many people have complained about the infected aka Dark Seekers's look (they were computer-generated), but honestly,even if you don't like it, it is a minor flaw that doesn't detract from the quality of the film. Will Smith delivers one of the best performances of his career, and the more dramatic the scene, the more he shines.Very impressive. In conclusion,I Am Legend is a very good sci-fi film with a powerful performance by Will Smith and definitely worth watching.7.5/10",Null,0,3,29 November 2009

Dave gets caught up in a bigger fight when he meets Big Daddy, a former cop who, in his quest to bring down the evil drug lord Frank D'Amico, has trained his eleven-year-old daughter to be the ruthless vigilante Hit-Girl.Whenever there's a lot of hype an buzz around a film, I always tend to be suspicious. When there's so much talk about a film before its release, that is usually due to extensive marketing and publicity by the studios and not an indicator of the film's quality. In fact, most of the time, a lot of hype means a shallow and low quality Hollywood blockbuster (i.e. Avatar).And that's precisely the case with Kick-Ass. A somewhat entertaining film but at the same time extremely flawed.Despite an original premise, the story couldn't be more predictable,it's almost insulting in fact. The dialog isn't that great either and most characters are caricatures.There's also an awful lot of over-acting. As a comedy the film fails miserably, most of the jokes are incredibly plain, simple and above all, very, very silly and it doesn't help that the film shifts tones constantly. What's to enjoy? A few well done action scenes and some of the interactions between Hit-Girl and her father.I'm sure some people will be offended by the strong language used by Hit Girl, after all the actress playing the part was only 11 years old at the time Kick-Ass was being filmed but to be honest, I don't think anything she said is too offensive. In conclusion, the film is decent enough to be watched until the end but I think it is a very poor effort and a film you should probably skip. Definitely not worthy of all the buzz.6/10",Null,3,11,11 May 2010
Unknown," Mediocre thriller
","Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones) arrive in Berlin for a biotechnology summit. Upon arriving at their hotel, Martin realizes he forgot his briefcase at the airport. He takes a taxicab driven by Gina (Diane Kruger), but on the way to the airport, the cab crashes off a bridge into the river after narrowly avoiding a refrigerator that falls off a delivery truck. Martin is knocked unconscious upon impact, but Gina saves him from drowning before fleeing from the scene. On Thanksgiving day, he comes to at the hospital after being in a coma for four days.Martin returns to his hotel, only to discover that his wife who proclaims to not know him, is with another man who says he's Dr.Martin Harris.Unknown has a tremendous premise and a great actor in the lead role, Liam Neeson. However, this film did not succeed and the main reason is because of its execution. The plot is, in fact, quite interesting, there's quite a bit of action and the acting is pretty good. And I must say that the twist was not at all what I expected and it will be extremely difficult for anyone to predict it. Having said that, the way all these bits were put together did not make a very good film. It has a lot of potential but it never really reaches and ends up being a very mediocre thriller. Much inferior to Liam Neeson's last action thriller, Taken, for instance.6/10",Null,2,4,6 June 2011
Gran Torino," Magnificent
","Walt Kowalski is a widower who holds onto his prejudices despite the changes in his Michigan neighborhood and the world around him. He is a grumpy, tough-minded, unhappy old man who's angry at the world and doesn't get along with his kids. He's a a Korean War veteran and his most prized possession is a 1972 Gran Torino.When his neighbor Thao, a young Hmong teenager under pressure from his gang member cousin, tries to steal his Gran Torino, Kowalski sets out to reform the youth. Drawn against his will into the life of Thao's family, Kowalski is soon taking steps to protect them from the gangs that infest their neighborhood... Gran Torino is a magnificent movie. Clint Eastwood who had double duty, directed and starred, delivered a terrific performance as Walt Kowalski in this simple yet very powerful story. Yes, Walt is angry at the world; but how could he not be when he sees his neighborhood filled with gangs? How could he not be when he sees the way today's youth behave? His wife just pasted away and he's alone in his house,no one cares about him and basically there's no place in the world for him. He also doesn't get along with his sons, but how could he when they are shallow and materialistic? That's what's so great about this film, it's a tremendous character study but it also makes you reflect and consider the world we live in. When Walt befriends Thao, his life, slowly but surely, gains a new meaning even if he doesn't admit it and Thao gains something as well; a much needed male role model. Trough the course of the film, Walt helps Thao making the transition from boy to man and gives him tools ( metaphorical tools, not the ones he gave him for construction) to go out on the world and be someone. In the end Walt makes a sacrifice so that Thao and his family remain safe. Besides Eastwood, there's also Christopher Carley as the well intentioned Father Janovich and Bee Vang as Thao. I was disappointed with Bee Vang's acting and I felt it didn't match the the quality of the film but the screenplay is so strong that I was able to overlook this flaw. The film has quite a few funny moments but this is not a light story, however, thanks to Eastwood's direction, it's a very well balanced film and one not to be missed. Definitely one of the best films of 2008.9/10",Null,1,6,17 December 2009
The Hurt Locker," One of the year's best
","When SSgt William James joins Bravo Company in Iraq, they have a month or so left in their tour of duty. He's a bomb disposal expert and he is replacing Sgt Matt Thompson, a long-standing member of the team who was recently killed disposing of an improvised explosive device. To say that James loves what he does doesn't quite capture the emotional high he experiences when he gets to do what he does best. For his fellow squad members however, including Sgt JT Sanborn and Spc Owen Eldridge, they just want to survive the few days of duty they have left... The Hurt Locker is great, and possibly, the best war movie to come out in years. I'm not in the army and I have never been to war but I have the feeling that this is one of the most realistic and accurate depictions of what actually goes on in the field. Every scene feels extremely authentic. The films focus on a bomb squad, a unit that goes around checking out and disarming bombs and all sorts of exposing devices, that have either been planted, or just abandoned, but either way are dangerous. The 3 main characters are Will (Jeremy Renner), an adrenaline junkie who as I mentioned above is replacing a member of the team that was recently killed, the strong-minded leader Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) who is desperately counting the days to get the hell out of Iraq and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), who's having a hard time holding it together. A lot of the film is this unit simply trying to disarm dangerous devices and the pace is kinda slow, but the atmosphere is so tense and this sequences have so much suspense (because the soldiers never know who to trust and everyone seems suspect) that I couldn't take my eyes of the screen and was constantly on the edge of my seat. The acting is top-notch, although the 'less known' actors like Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie are the ones who truly shine and the well established actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce have minor roles and very little screen time. The only flaw I can think of, is the fact that the story could use a little more development. In the end Will comes trough as a man who only feels alive when experiencing danger and facing death, and that, was one of the most interesting parts of the film and maybe could have been explored a little more. The Hurt Locker seems to be the major Oscar contender of 2009 and while I think the film it's far from being a masterpiece, I'm sure it is one of the best films of the year.8/10",Null,3,7,14 December 2009
The Illusionist," Forgettable
","Ed Norton plays Eisenhein,a magician famous for his spectacular shows and mind-blowing tricks. As a young kid he was friends with Sophie, a duchess but they were taken apart and never saw each other again.Eisenhein then traveled the world learning the art of magic. One day he sees Sophie, now engaged to a crown prince, in one of his shows.From that point on the film focus on Eisenhein attempt to free Sophie from the royal house of Vienna so that they can finally be together.The movie is OK, to be honest, it didn't blew me away and I found the story quite predictable, half way trough the movie I had already figured out what was going to happen,obviously I didn't know all the details but I figured out the big twist almost right away. Plus I don't think this was the best showcase of Norton's abilities. However if you're into period pieces and original(although predictable) plots then give it a try.6.5/10",Null,6,8,19 August 2009
Garden State," Zach Braff's masterpiece
","'You're freaking out, aren't you? You're totally freaking out. You're like running for the door.'Andrew Largeman is a 26 year old waiter and a aspirant actor who has been on lithium and other sort of drugs since his childhood thus he cannot feel anything but detachment and he's always in a lethargic state.When Andrew's mother dies he returns to his hometown in order to attend the funeral.He ends up reconnecting with old friends and meeting the free spirit Sam. Then the story follows Andrew's journey and his search for meaning. Zack Braff did great as Andrew Large,its the second time I see him in a movie,1st time was The Last Kiss, and so far he did amazingly well, don't forget he wrote, produced, and stared this movie; Natalie Portman stoles the whole thing thought. She gives so much depth to her character and delivers a terrific performance. She's probably the best actress out there right now. Peter Sarsgaard may not be an A-list but he sure has talent. The musical score is pretty spot on and Braff deserved the Grammy.Garden State is about life, its about love, its about taking action,its about the 'infinite abyss' the characters discover which is obviously a metaphor for the unknown, the what's yet to come.Life is too short for us to sit back and wait for something better, we must start living it.As someone here said this could very well be the movie of this generation in a sense that so many people these days live in a apathetic state and unable to appreciate life. 9/10Update: I just saw it again,2 days after the first viewing. This is my 2nd favorite movie of all time.",Null,0,1,3 December 2008
Jerry Maguire," Somewhat silly but still entertaining
","Contains one minor spoiler: Jerry Maguire it's one of those classics that people talk about and remember for years. However when the film came out, I was only 6, so I watched it for the first time today. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise), is a very successful sports agent. His job requires him to constantly manipulate,lie and deceive and he's great at it. But one day, Jerry starts to have second thoughts about the nature of the job, he starts to question himself and ultimately grows a conscience. He proceeds to write a 'mission statement' suggesting a change of behavior and alternatives to the current methods being used by agents, and because of it, he gets fired. Only one client stays with Jerry, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), an egomaniacal football player. Meanwhile Jerry starts a relationship with Doroty (Renée Zellweger), a 26 year old single-mother who worked at his agency but decided to quit and help Jerry because she was inspired by the mission statement and also because she has a crush on him. Now Jerry has to balance his personal life and help his only client reach success... Jerry Maguire it's a good film, entertaining and somewhat engaging, however it does gets a bit touchy-feely and corny at times. The writing has some inconsistencies, for instance; Jerry marries Dorothy, basically because he doesn't know how/want to be alone. Later on, he starts to question the marriage and his feelings, only to come to the conclusion( after a quick break up) that he does love her. It's just not very good writing, if you ask me. Having said that, Tom Cruise carries the film on his back and delivers a tremendous performance. Now that I'm seeing his 'old' films, no wonder he went on to become such a movie star. He has tons of charisma and it shows on screen. Cuba Gooding Jr was great and very funny as Tidwell, Jerry's only client, but, although he did won one, it's far from being an Oscar-worthy performance. Renée Zellweger was OK and so was the rest of the supporting cast. All in all, Jerry Maguire is not great, but it's still a good time. The film is also known for some lines that have become extremely famous and its funny too see how it all began. Watch it for Cruise's performance and for its classic status.7/10",Null,1,3,9 December 2009
Paranormal Activity," Over-hyped
","Its shocking to see how many people are saying that Paranormal Activity is fantastic or, an amazing horror film or even, the scariest movie of all time. Come on! Really? What kind of standards do people use these days? Anyway, the story is the following: a couple ,Katie and Micah, move into a suburban house and after some time they become increasingly disturbed by a presence that may or may not be somehow demonic. In order to figure out what is going on Micah buys a camera which he carries around the house by day and at night sets it up in the bedroom (where most of the paranormal activity takes place) in hopes of catching something. The film is presented in a faux documentary style and it was shot exclusively by a hand-held camera and most of it takes place in this small suburban house. Despite the fact that there's only one set and two actors the film engages the viewer completely although I think either the pace was too slow or the movie was dragged out a bit. The actors did a great job as well. Now, don't get me wrong, I think the idea for this film is great and the director did a great job considering the resources he had but in regards to the 'horror' itself, there's a couple of really scary moments but other then that, its just your average horror flick, don't think, even for a second, that this movie is terrifying or as so many here are saying, ' the scariest movie ever'. Having said that Paranormal Activity is definitely worth a watch due to its originality. Invite a couple of friends, turn off the lights and you'll have some fun. Just manage your expectations.6/10",Null,0,1,22 October 2009
The Dark Knight," Run-of-the-mill superhero movie with big pretensions
","Batman raises the stakes in his bourgeois war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as The Joker... The Dark Knight is nothing more then an average super hero movie. I find it to be completely overrated and I couldn't disagree more with those who consider this to be worthy of the top250 IMDb list. First of all, after a while, the story gets boring and dull because there's too much politics and bureaucracy involved, and it's not that I don't enjoy a rich plot, it's just that it all seems very contrived and pointless and it drags out way too long. They injected a lot of philosophical questions and moral dilemmas in an attempt to diverge a little from the usual cut and dry, straight-forward superhero movie but, they should've sticked to what the genre usually offers, entertainment and action, because the end product is a very uneven piece of work. The actions scenes were disappointing mainly because of the editing and successive cuts that make it hard to really see what's going on, this happens particularly in the fighting sequences. Now, regarding the acting, I did enjoy Ledger's portrayal of The Joker, but I think it's miles away from being an Oscar-worthy performance and I'm sure his tragic death contributed to his winning, at least to a certain extent. Christian Bale, wasn't exactly bad either but, his cold and distant Bruce Wayne could never compete with Robert Downey Jr's witty and sarcastic Tony Stark for instance. Obviously the two movies have different tones, but the point I'm making is, Bale lacks charisma. Aaron Eckhart was fine as Harvey-Dent; what really threw me off was the fact that his character went from being incorruptible to killing innocent people without so much as a twitch ,all this because his lover, Rachel Dawes, gets killed. This is poor and incoherent writing. Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine have minor roles and aren't worth mentioning. It's really something, the level of hype around this film, and the favored public reaction, the thing is, The Dark Knight doesn't know what it wants to be and tries to hard, sometimes it's a comic adaptation, and then it turns into a deep philosophical exercise and things don't work that way. It lacks coherence and a strong screenplay.5/10",Null,5,9,19 December 2009
Into the Wild," Will make you think
","Finally had a chance to watch the critically claimed Into The Wild.I kinda liked it but I also have mixed feelings regarding the story and the way it has been told.The movie which is based on real events,tells the story of Chris McCandless,played by Emile Hirch, a college graduate who rebels against society and its restrictions and despite having great grades,instead of enrolling in an university, donates his savings to charity and decides to live in the wild.His final destination is Alaska and along the way Chris meets a series of characters who shape his life.Some of them also learn from Chris and gain a new perspective on life.Its interesting to watch Chris's adventure but I would have liked to learn more about his beliefs and motivations.At some point in the movie Chris speaks about society and people in general,giving his opinion and discussing certain aspects of life and that was one of the most interesting scenes. That should have been explored a bit more so that as a viewer we could really understand what was going on trough his head and where he was coming from.We're told that his parents relationship which he considered fake was one of the reasons that led to his rebellion, he just didn't understand all the lies and became frustrated but it could not be just that, Chris had to have some very strong views about society otherwise he wouldn't just abandon everything and that's what I think would be interesting to know. Another complaint I have is, at some point in his journey Chris meets Tracy Tatro,played by Kristin Stewart, and they become very close(or so it seems).When Tracy gives the indication that she wants to sleep with Chris, he says he can't do it because she's a minor and it is against the law.Here we have someone that is rebelling against society and who is all about freedom and enjoying life, and when it comes to the most natural act between two people that love each other,sex, he refuses to do it because of the law? Something that society created? I just thought it was completely out of character.Apparently the real Chris and Tracy weren't atracted to each other but if Sean Penn is going to make it look like that he should at least make the scene consistent with the character's beliefs.Having said that, the film is beautifully shot,Emile Hirsch is great as Chris and so is Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz, one of the characters Christ meets in his journey and probably the most memorable one.I didn't love the soundtrack but I can't deny it suits the movie.Into The Wild is a film that really makes you think about your life,about happiness and its meaning,about our 'journey' on earth and its a film that deserves to be watched.7.5/10",Null,1,3,31 October 2009
Blood Diamond," Average film
","Blood Diamond shows us how it was like in Sierra Leone in the 90's, a country in Africa where blood is shed every single day over diamonds. It depicts the war between the government forces and the rebel forces,and the absolute chaos that reigned over the country at that time. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Archer, an ex-mercenary turned diamonds smuggler and Djimon Hounsou is Solomond Vandy, a fisherman who's village is invade by the rebels.They take Solomond to work in the mines, and they take his son to make him a child soldier.At some point Archer and Solomon fates become joined in a common quest to recover a pink diamond.Blood Diamond is a powerful movie and well-directed.Plus, an interesting performance by Leoanardo Dicaprio and an immense presence by Djimon Hounsou.Blood Diamond is a good movie; the reason why I only gave it a 7 its because it isn't really my kind of movie,however if you enjoy movies that depict a certain moment in history, or a certain conflict/war this is definitely a must see.Hopefully the film will also raise awareness to the overall situation in Africa.According to this movie although Sierra Leone is now at peace, there are still 200.000 child soldiers in Africa.6.5/10",Null,0,2,27 August 2009
The Graduate," Manage your expectations
","After hearing great things about this film, and the impact it had on people and how it was 'the film of a generation' I was obviously expecting a tremendous movie, and maybe, that's why I felt so disappointed.My expectations were too high.I just don't see the brilliance,I don't see any relevance,I don't get why this film is hold in such high esteem and its considered to be a true classic,I don't see any revolutionary ideas or something that would justify calling this film 'the film of a generation'.Fightclub for instance, was thought-provoking and analyzed(and criticized in a way) the youth of today,it showed how society crippled and chained man, how it transformed us into a receptacle for consumption leaving us with an identity crisis of unparalleled proportions.For me, Fightclub is definitely the film of a generation,it describes perfectly what was happening (and still is)in the turn of the century,The Graduate on the other hand(which was viewed as extremely revolutionary in the 60's) its just a simple romantic comedy.A pretty straight-forward story.Sure I can see the alienation of the young Ben Braddock(played by Dustin Hoffman),I see how he is rebelling against the conformism of his parents,how he's drifting trough life not sure of what he wants or who he is but none of this is revolutionary and in the end after having an affair with an older woman,Ben, rather than striking a blow for self-determination, ends up with the woman's daughter,the exact same girl his parents had picked out for him. Sure, the movie is somewhat funny,there is some interesting camera work and some original transitions between shots and scenes and overall the film is enjoyable(mainly because of Hoffman's performance) but it is not what it's made out to be. Or maybe it doesn't stand the test of time,either way I find The Graduate to be an overrated and irrelevant film.6/10",Null,0,2,30 October 2009
Avatar," The plot plays second to the visuals
","In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like, moon of the planet Polyphemus, in the Alpha Centauri star system. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) heads the mining operation, employing marines for security. The corporation intends to exploit Pandora's reserves of a valuable mineral called unobtanium. Pandora is inhabited by the Na'vi, a blue-skinned species of sapient humanoids with feline characteristics. Physically much stronger and taller than humans, the Na'vi live in harmony with Nature, worshiping a mother goddess called Eywa. Humans cannot survive exposure to Pandora's atmosphere for very long and must use gas masks. Attempting to improve relations with the natives and learn about Pandora's biology, scientists grow Na'vi bodies modified with human DNA, called avatars, that are controlled by genetically-matched, mentally-linked human operators. The film focuses on Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former marine that despite having no training whatsoever, becomes an operator.Avatar has been in development since 1994 and it's James Cameron's first film in over 10 years. With an estimated budget of $280,000,000, Avatar is one of the most expensive films ever made. Thankfully for Cameron, the film is already the second highest grossing film of all time by ranking in 1.14 billion at the global box office. Cameron's previous film, Titanic is still number one but not for much longer. So, is all the hype and buzz surrounding this film justified? Not really. Cameron is indeed no stranger to science fiction, having done the Terminator films but, here he really tried to push the envelope; was he successful? Kind of. Visually, there's no denying it, Avatar is impressive, and it's not so much that the film is in 3D (sometimes you don't even notice it is and this kind of technology has clearly a long way to go still) but more the fact that Cameron imagined a pretty cool world. Pandora has some beautiful landscapes (computer-generated obviously) and you can tell that a lot of work was invested in the visual aspect of the film. The avatars were also very well done and if you look closely, you'll see the resemblance to the actors.Unfortunately, Avatar is very weak story-wise. The plot is a melange of age-old stories. It's very simplistic, childish even and has been done countless times: assimilation of an individual into a new culture, a cross-culture love story, heroic uprising against oppressors. The dialog is not that great either and on top of that there's a few plot holes and inconsistencies and the film is overlong. The monumental battle scenes and the grandiose music give an epic feeling to the film but the thin plot is impossible to overlook and really drags the film down. Sam Worthington was pretty good as Jake Sully and he has proved once again that he is leading man material. On the other hand, the praise Zoe Saldana has received for her performance is puzzling. The actress doesn't have any screen time. She only borrows her voice (and some of her movements were captured) to a character and I don't quite understand how that can be considered a great performance. Sigourney Weaver, the most experienced actress of the cast was actually disappointing.Overall, Avatar is not a bad film, the problem is the plot plays second to the visuals. The film was extremely over-hyped and while it might be impressive on a technical level, it's not a great film by any means let alone a masterpiece or the next step in entertainment.6/10",Null,3,7,14 January 2010

Right after lifting off, however, he learns he isn't alone on his journey, since Russell, a wilderness explorer 70 years his junior, has inadvertently become a stowaway on the trip...I finally got a chance to watch the critically acclaimed 'Up' and here are my thoughts: Up is great; but only for its target audience which is young kids. Although Pixar has mixed things around a bit this time by, introducing an elderly character and briefly approaching such themes as life and death,loss,loneliness and the passing of time,the film is clearly children oriented. Sure, it is uplifting,vibrant and fun and the animation and gci is great but its also crazy,unrealistic and ridiculous. I don't think anyone older then 7/8 years old will take this film seriously. As a kids films, I think Up is tremendous,probably a delight for any kid and I would rate it possibly as 8 or 9; as an overall film, its almost a disgrace. But how could it not be? This film shouldn't even be compared to regular films because it has a very exclusive and limited target audience.Has yet to be made a film that can be fully enjoyed by people of all ages.5/10",Null,0,3,19 November 2009
Zombieland," Visually stylish, fun and entertaining but not as good as everyone says
","Zombieland focuses on two men who have found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies. Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies. Zombieland is a horror/black comedy that is never truly scary or funny but stays in between. There's a lot of gore, violence,action, strong language and even a little bit of romance. There's the occasional laughs but more so because of the stupidity and absurdity of some of the scenes instead of deliberately funny situations. The main strength of Zombieland is probably the dialog, always sharp and never sappy as it usually is in this genre. There are also a couple of visual gags and spoofs of other films that will make you smile and put you in a good mood.The actors were all well cast with Woody Harrelson shining the most as Tallahassee, the redneck ace vampire killer. Certainly, a huge improvement from his latest comic role in Roland Emmerich's 2012. Bill Murray has a small cameo but it seemed a bit pointless and just something to fill in some time. Overall, Zombieland is a very entertaining and fun fast-paced film and a good debut by director Ruben Fleischer, just not the amazing film people are making it out to be.7/10",Null,0,0,30 December 2009
Enemy at the Gates," A cat-and-mouse duel between two snipers
","To be perfectly honest, I watched this film mainly because Jude Law stars in it, he's very talented and one of my favorite actors to watch so I decided to give it a try. And I'm glad I did, because Enemy at the Gates is not only a great film but one of the best war films I have seen. The story takes place during World War II and is based on real events: Germans and Russians are fighting over every block of Stalingrad and the city is in ruins. Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev, (Jude Law) stalks the Germans, taking them out one by one, thus hurting the morale of the German troops. The political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) leads him on, publishing his efforts to give his countrymen some hope. But Vassili eventually starts to feel that he can not live up to the expectations on him. On top of that he and Danilov fall in love with the same girl, a female soldier called Tanya(Rachel Weisz). From Germany comes the master sniper König (Ed Harris) to put an end to the extraordinary skilled Russian sniper... The film's visual style is grand, the battle scenes are chaotic and extremely well made and so were the sequences that show a devastated Stalingrad. Art directors, editors and cinematographers, all did a terrific job. But the main storyline is the cat-and-mouse duel between the brave and heroic Vassili and the cold and driven König as each sniper tries to stay one step ahead of the other. Jude Law's performance was subtle but very efficient, but his British accent will probably bother the purists. The supporting cast made the most of their roles. A special mention to Ed Harris who was very convincing and menacing as the German Sniper König. Many have commented that the love triangle feels out of place but for me, it's just another side to a great story. Overall, Enemy at the Gates is a very nice film, technically superb, and a must see for those interested in the war.7.5/10",Null,3,4,18 December 2009
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 'Don't make a bit of sense to me.'
","I was truly exited when I decided to watch this movie. Top 250? Check! Oscar winning picture? Check! One of the most famous A-list actors in it? Check!Oh boy...where do I start? I know I belong to a minority when I say this but I hated this movie.So R.P. McMurphy is a man with several assault convictions that has raped a 15 year old girl thus he's in jail.Supposedly he acted like a crazy person in prison in order to avoid it but was sent to an asylum.Basically after a while McMurphy starts to bond (only a little bit)with the other patients mainly with a 'chief' who pretended to be deaf. McMurphy also stands out as the only sane person in there.McMurphy starts a feud with head nurse Mildred Ratched who tries to keep the voluntary patients in the asylum for ever.One day McMurphy and the chief decide to escape, and McMurphy calls his girlfriends to help.They come, then they all party hard and McMurphy instead of escaping falls asleep.That's right he doesn't pass out, he just falls asleep after he planned an escape which is plain stupid.Tired of seeing McMurphy causing problems the staff give him a lobotomy.In the day after,the chief succeeds to escape but first kills McMurphy so he wouldn't stay 'like that' in that place. This is the story, there's nothing more to it. Now where's the brilliance of this movie? I don't get it. Five Oscars?! Louise Fletcher won an Oscar for her performance and that has to be a joke.Am I the only who realizes her screen time was like 15 minutes? The final verdict: this movie is boring,slow-paced, the story has no interest whatsoever , it doesn't deserve a single Oscar( in my opinion of course)and its definitely one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. 3/10",Null,10,21,9 December 2008
The Wrestler," Fascinating
","Yesterday I saw The Wrestler for the second time and I came to the conclusion that I really do love every single minute of this movie and it is easily one of my favorites.The direction is outstanding and so is Mikey Rourke's performance.The wrestler tells the story of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a faded wrestler who was a star in the 80's. Now he only does small wrestling shows,lives alone in a trailer and he's the shadow of the man he used to be.One day he collapses after a show and at the hospital he is told he won't be able to wrestle anymore.Feeling defeated, he starts to invest more in the relationship with Cassidy,a stripper in a local bar,and tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter...First thing you'll notice in The Wrestler is the camera work,the camera is most of the time behind the lead character following him,this is not only innovative but as strange as it seems it gives the viewer a better perception/understanding of the character. Its almost like the viewer is the character.Mickey Rourke's performance is simply amazing, and as many have said is hard to know where the character ends and Rourke begins which makes the overall experience even better. Not every actor could pull off this kind of performance,so Rourke was definitely the right choice and I'm glad Aronofsky got that and fought against the studio who wanted a 'bigger' star. The score composed by Clint Mansel(what a genius) is beautiful and compliments the film.Evan Rachel Wood deserves to be mentioned as well, she has a small part but she takes the most of it.At the end of the day The Wrestler is more about people then the sport itself and that is what makes this movie so great.Pay special attention to the amazing and tremendously emotional speech by Ram(that also reflects Rourke's life) in the last scenes of the movie; its a brilliant speech and pretty much sums up everything that happen until that point, who the character is and the place he's at in that moment.Fascinating.10/10",Null,1,2,1 September 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Style over substance, very disappointing
","Despite being a well known pop culture figure, I had little to no contact to Sherlock Holmes until today. I never read the stories or watched the films and mini series. I knew, of course who he was and a little bit about Watson as well because, well, their reputation proceeds them. Sherlock Holmes is so popular that the Guinness World Records has consistently listed him as the 'most portrayed movie character' with 75 actors playing the part in over 211 films. An update of this classic tale sounded like a great idea. Unfortunately, Guy Ritchie's adaption is rather disappointing. The story begins with Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson finally catching serial killer and occult 'sorcerer' Lord Blackwood. He gets the death penalty. But Blackwood mysteriously returns from the grave and resumes his killing spree. Holmes, then reopens the case and tries to unravel the clues to this mystery... Ritchie's rendition of Sherlocke Holmes is somewhat engaging and entertaining but it also has the typical flaws of a blockbuster. First thing you'll notice in the film is the weird camera angles, and the freeze-frame edits. It's Richie's trademark and he seems to love it because he does this in all of his works. Visually, it's definitely a stylish film but sometimes Richie goes a bit over the top creating certain situations with little or no relevance to the plot just to show his skills, like the bare-knuckle boxing sequences. The script is a mess; it's all over the place, lacks focus and the plot twist, if you can call it that, is nothing more than a setup for the inevitable sequel. Honestly, the big mystery is not that interesting, captivating or well written for that matter. The strength of the film lies in the performances of the lead actors even though, I've seen them doing much, much better. Robert Downey Jr was very charismatic as always but he was clearly out of his element. Jude Law did fine but I almost feel he's too good of an actor to play such a small, underdeveloped character; and Rachel McAdams, was energetic and vibrant as usual. I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Ritchie. And this film didn't change my opinion one bit. His approach to film-making is much more style than substance and this film is the clear evidence of that. Those expecting something clever and well thought will be disappointed.5/10",Null,2,5,19 January 2010
Platoon," The horrors of the war
","Chris Taylor is a young, naive American who gives up college and volunteers for combat in Vietnam. Upon arrival, he quickly discovers that his presence is quite nonessential, and is considered insignificant to the other soldiers, as he has not fought for as long as the rest of them and felt the effects of combat. Chris has two commanding officers, the ill-tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias Grodin. A line is drawn between the two officers and a number of men in the platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid. As the war continues, Chris himself draws towards psychological meltdown... Oliver Stone's Platoon is an epic film that depicts the Vietnam War and the horrific things that some men did and witnessed, it also shows the insanity of war, the terrible conditions the soldiers fought under, and perhaps more importantly, the psychological element that wore down so many men. Stone used some of his own experiences of being in Vietnam to write this story and the result is what seems to be a very authentic and realistic film. It's a gritty and emotional look at this terrible conflict, mostly seen through the perspective of the young recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). The main storyline and possible the most interesting aspect of the film is the realization by Taylor, that he is fighting two battles, the conflict with the enemy and the conflict between the men within his platoon. In terms of the story I thought it was terrific and it feels/looks authentic, however, with the exception of Sheen, the acting was a bit over the top and quite a distraction. The musical score is very effective with the 'Adagio for Strings' composition really bringing all the emotion out of the scenes. In conclusion, Platoon is a great war film, it might be disturbing but it's also necessary. On a side note, I watched a version with not so great quality, so I might enjoy the film a little more upon a second viewing.7.5/10",Null,0,1,27 December 2009
Blow," Doesn't blow one bit
","George Jung is the son of a struggling small business owner. Seeing his family struggle to make ends meet and failing, George vows never to share a similar fate. Moving to California, he starts his own pot pushing operation in which he finds both success and imprisonment. In prison, he meets a cellmate who introduces him into a partnership to the lucrative new market in cocaine. Upon release, George Jung quickly becomes instrumental in establishing the exploding US market for cocaine in which he claimed that he handled about 85% of the supply in the 1970's. However, for all the fabulous wealth and power he gained, the true costs of his dangerously treacherous occupation catch up with him in ways from which he would never recover... Blow is a very interesting biography that shows George Jung as a complex individual and in some ways, a victim of the American dream. One can also argue, that the poverty-stricken environment he grew up in, may have shaped George's mentality and ideology and pushed him, even if not directly, to dealing drugs. After all, at the time, dealing drugs was nothing more then an easy way to make money, and that was George's goal, so he wouldn't have to go trough , again, what he went trough in his childhood. The story has a very fast pace and the self-narration is great, and an element that I always enjoy in films. The direction is quite stylish and Depp, who plays the lead character, George Jung, delivers a great performance and showed, as always, bucket-loads of charisma. He plays this role in a way that everyone will sympathize with the character despite him being involved in illegal affairs. Definitely, one of the actor's best performances. Ray Liotta, who plays George's father was also very good, and it's heartbreaking to see the character suffering with his son's imprisonment, because despite not agreeing with what George was doing, he truly loved him and always supported him. Penelope Cruz who plays George's second wife was a bit over the top for my taste but nothing that ruins the film. The only negative aspect of Blow, is the fact that the story spans three decades and some of the characters, like George's parents for instance, seem to age very little. I know this is a technicality but it's something that should have been paid more attention to. Overall, Blow is a fine example of story-telling and film-making.8/10",Null,0,1,16 December 2009
Vanilla Sky," Masterpiece
","Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young man with everything going for him,good looks,a successful career and on top of that he's extremely wealthy.On his birthday party he meets Sofia Serrano, a simple yet charming woman and becomes attracted to her.After spending some time with Sofia, David gets into a car accident and when he wakes up after the accident nothing is the same and his life takes a turn for the surreal.Its extremely hard to talk about Vanilla Sky without spoiling it but lets say that it combines several genres of movies and it keeps you guessing from the beginning to the end with some very unexpected twists. The movie plays with perceptions while at the same time pushing boundaries.Its an amazing journey to say the least.I can guarantee you that long time after the movie ends you'll still be thinking about it. The soundtrack is memorizing,Tom Cruise's performance is Oscar worthy and the movie was extremely well directed.I have never seen the original (Abre Los Ojos 1997) but since I enjoyed this one so much, I'm planning to.Between the coded messages, the subtle clues, the references to pop culture, the amazing story, the incredible performance by Tom Cruise, and the beautiful soundtrack, this film is a masterpiece.

Iron Man," Iron Man aka Robert Downey Jr Show
","After a long wait and hearing everyone acclaim this movie, I finally had the chance to check it out by myself.This movie is pretty good. It is not Oscar material,its pure entertainment but done very nicely and stylish. In my opinion this is the first successful marvel super hero adaptation to date.The Story has been adapted for the modern times which was a good move in my opinion(In the original story tony stark became iron man during the Vietnam war although later they pushed this moment forward to the golf war.) The plot is good,the GCI is acceptable( the suit is amazing),it has several well made action scenes and as the movie goes on you become even more interested.But the greatest thing about Iron Man is no doubt the choice of Robert Downey Jr to play tony stark and the way producers approached this character. He is a player,he drinks,he smokes, he is a political incorrect smart-ass who wants to live life to the fullest.Just my kind of Hero. And taking into consideration Robert Downey Jr past, you realize that that no one could have done it better. He truly was a bit of tony stark in the past and he excels in this role. If they had shown a little more of this side of tony stark I think the movie would be even better.Iron Man has some tiny flaws but its pure entertainment.",Null,1,2,19 August 2008
Trainspotting," Bold, crazy and wild
","A wild, freeform, Rabelaisian trip through the darkest recesses of Edinburgh low-life, focusing on Mark Renton and his attempt to give up his heroin habit, and how the latter affects his relationship with family and friends: Sean Connery wannabe Sick Boy, dimbulb Spud, psycho Begbie, 14-year-old girlfriend Diane, and clean-cut athlete Tommy, who's never touched drugs but can't help being curious about them...I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It is a shocking look at the effects drugs can have on people and the same time it poses some interesting questions about the world we live in and the youth. It has a very original screenplay and one of the most stylish directions I have ever seen. It is a energetic, imaginative, and vibrant film and at the time it came out, it must have felt very unique. I really enjoyed it but had I seen this film in 1996 ( I was too young but I'm talking hypothetically ) this film would have made a much bigger impact in me (specially the visual aspect of it) and the reason why is because the director Danny Boyle, uses certain filming techniques, and certain effects that are truly mind-blowing and make for great scenes but, as of 2009, this techniques are now fairly common and have been used by several directors. And again, I think Trainspotting is great but had I not seen such films as Requiem For A Dream(2000) and Garden State(2004) just to name a few, I would definitely think more of this one. Anyway, the film balances extremely well, humorous moments with the more disturbing scenes, and always staying truth to itself. At times, the narrative isn't as focused as it should be but this is a minor flaw. Of all the actors two deserve being mentioned, first, Robert Carlyle who plays Begbie, one of the so called mates of Mark Renton, a very unlikable character but extremely well played by the actor, and second, Ewan Mcgregor who's terrific as the lead character, Renton, and delivers probably, the best performance of his career so far. The soundtrack is great as well and fits perfectly with the crazy and chaotic scenes of the film. Trainspotting is definitely a must-see for any movie-lover.8/10",Null,1,1,11 December 2009

Vicky Christina Barcelona is a tremendous film,and hands down,the best scrip Woody Allen has written in the last decade.Everything just falls into the right place,from the beautiful scenarios to the witty speech which is a well-known trademark of Woody.You just can't help but appreciate this beautiful story.The acting was superb.Javier Bardem was the perfect choice to play Juan Antonio as he seemed so comfortable in the role.Scarlett Johansson sort of reprises her characters in Scoop and Match Point.Rebecca Hall was quite a pleasant surprise and Penelope Cruz was very good as the crazy and screwed up passionate ex-wife but not good enough for an Oscar nomination as some individuals are saying.This film should really win a Best Acting Ensemble award tough.Don't miss this film, its a great story with all the necessary ingredients to please a movie lover.8/10",Null,0,2,31 December 2008
Identity," Original
","Identity is a thriller set at an isolated motel in rural Nevada during an unrelenting rainstorm. With all roads washed out and all forms of communication dead, a group of people become stranded at the motel along with the shifty manager (John Hawkes). Among the stranded are Ed (John Cusack), a former cop turned limo driver; Caroline (Rebecca De Mornay), a self-absorbed actress; Paris (Amanda Peet), a prostitute attempting to escape her profession; Rhodes (Ray Liotta), a cop transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey); Lou (William Lee Scott) and Ginny (Clea DuVall), bickering newlyweds; and George (John McGinley) and Alice (Leila Kenzle), a married couple traveling with their young son. Soon the waterlogged lodgers start dying in mysterious--and brutal--ways, and the increasingly dwindling number of survivors must discover the killer to prevent their own demises.The initial formula for this film seems very cliché and something we've seen a thousand times before. However, Identity has a very clever and bold twist. Something very unexpected that completely turns the film around and makes it one of the most original thrillers I have seen in a long time. It's hard to talk about it without spoiling the film but I'll say this, the viewers that 'stick' trough Identity will be rewarded with something much more interesting and intriguing then the usual 'we're getting murdered one by one'-kind of thriller. Also the entire cast did a good job with perhaps Amanda Peet standing out. Overall, a very original little thriller and a breath of fresh air from an overdone genre.6.5/10",Null,0,1,5 May 2010

One of their operations, an armored-car robbery, goes bad and the armored-car guards are murdered by the gunmen - putting LAPD homicide detective Vince Hanna on the trail of the thieves. Hanna knows it will take a lot to bring these dangerous, armed thieves down, and it will end in a horrifying gun battle when the thieves try to rob a major federal bank... Heat is a pretentious and overrated crime thriller. I don't know about 1995 but as of today, the film fails to impress. The fact that Heat is hold as one of the best thrillers of all time is a joke. Michael Mann, himself, has done much better thrillers that don't have half the fame of Heat, like Collateral and Miami Vice for instance. First of all, the film seems to put all its chips in the reunion of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino instead of being an exciting thriller with a proper story and good writing. Good actors don't make a good film, it's as simple as that. The plot is convoluted, shallow and empty, and the side stories thrown in, like Pacino's suicidal stepdaughter and a gang member that turns out to be a serial rapist/murderer on the side are uninteresting and contrived. Plus, the action sequences are completely unrealistic with the thieves killing several cops and escaping despite being surrounded and completely outnumbered. Roberto De Niro was actually enjoyable as the gang leader Neal MacAuley, but he didn't have much room to expand or develop the character thanks to a mediocre script. On the other hand, Al Pacino, who I enjoyed in other films, was a huge disappointment. He was constantly trying too hard and had no sense of subtlety, he just screamed and yelled his lines without any real purpose. Val Kilmer, John Voigh, the great William Fichtner and a very young Natalie Portman, all had too little screen time to even comment on their performances. Another big problem, was the run time. The film drags and drags clocking at an amazing 170 minutes, almost 3 hours, when the story could have been easily told in 90 minutes or so. Overall, Heat is a mediocre thriller with a poorly written script that has gained much fame, only because, it stars two of the most well-known actors in Hollywood.5/10",Null,5,12,20 December 2009
Moon," Not the next big thing, but a great movie nevertheless
","With only three weeks left in his three year contract, Sam Bell is getting anxious to finally return to Earth. He is the only occupant of a Moon-based manufacturing facility along with his computer and assistant, GERTY. The long period of time alone however has resulted in him talking to himself for the most part, or to his plants. Direct communication with Earth is not possible due to a long-standing communication malfunction but he does get an occasional message from his wife Tess. When he has an accident however, he wakens to find that he is not alone. He also comes to realize that his world is not what he thought it was...Moon is a very interesting and promising debut from director Duncan Jones.This independent film has been extremely talked about and acclaimed by most critics and everyone in general.Many comparisons have been made and obviously,Sam's companion, Gerty, the computer voiced by Kevin Spacey, is a clear reminder of Hal from '2001,A Space Odyssey' but the comparisons should end there.They are completely different films and Moon,although being a very refreshing piece of work that stands on his own doesn't have what it takes to become such an all-time classic as 2001.Moon raises some very interesting questions when it comes to existentialism, and the circle of life and it is thought-provoking but Kubrik's film is a surreal journey that goes from the very beginning of the human kind to the space age,it's a roller coaster of emotions and the film was way before its time therefor it can't be compared to Moon.And don't get me wrong, Moon is a very good film with a great screenplay and feels like a breath of fresh air,however, it's not the 'next big thing' as it has been dubbed by some. I have to say that Sam Rockwell's performance is amazing,after all this is basically a one man show and he nailed it, he carries the film on his back and at the same time the film relies on him immensely which makes his performance the central piece of Moon.In conclusion,Moon is great watch and a must see for Sci Fi fans.7.5/10",Null,2,7,29 November 2009

Freida Pinto doesn't get much screen time but she is beautiful and quite lovely as the object of affection of Jamal. All the children actors were great and they may very well be the real stars.The musical score is absolutely fantastic and one of the best I have seen in movies.

The Proposal," Isn't worth watching
","I've seen some good comedies in the last months; Tropic thunder, Zack and Miri Make A Porno, Role Models,and I got to say that it seemed that comedies were getting a bit more sophisticated. Today I watched The Proposal and by watching this film you can seen everything that's wrong with most comedies.This little comedy is just so boring,predictable,unoriginal and more importantly, not funny. I mean,I only laughed three or four times during the entire movie (and only a little) which is pretty bad when you're watching a comedy.I would go even further as to say that the movie is better in its few dramatic moments then in the 'supposedly' funny scenes.I'm not saying this is the worst film ever made or even a bad film, but it is so mediocre and,well; crappy in lack of a better term.The premise is quite simple; Margaret Tate,played by Sandra Bullock is a Canadian editor-in-chief of a book publishing company living in USA and in order to keep her visa and avoid being deported she blackmails her assistant,Andrew Paxton,played by Ryan Reynolds into marrying her; what people call a sham wedding.Obviously they have to pretend they're really together and in love so you can imagine the complications.And then the the viewer is hit right in the face (and I say this because it does hurt to watch something so unoriginal)with the biggest cliché possible, the characters develop true feelings for each other during this scheme. Both Reynolds and Bullock are fine actors and I have nothing bad to say about them, the problem here is the script.Its just a very lame,corny and mediocre comedy that really isn't worth watching when there are so many great movies out there.5.5/10",Null,2,4,24 September 2009
Valkyrie," Very interesting and with historical value
","Bryan Singer's new film,Valkyrie tells the story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg,a German army officer who, in the world war two, planned and executed a plot to kill Adolf Hitler and save Germany. As part of his plan,Stauffenberg, arranged for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie(hence the name of the film) to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of the Fuhrer. The movie shows the efforts of Stauffenberg and others,the planning of the conspiracy,the contingencies, the several attempts to actually execute the plan and so on. Stauffenberg is played by Tom Cruise,who could perhaps have immersed himself in the character a little more but, nevertheless, did a good job. The 'look' of the film; wardrobe,locations and infantry is amazing and feels very authentic. The fact that the characters speak English is expected,after all, this is an American film but, I don't think it hurt the movie at all,we all know this events took place in Germany and what is important here is the story that is being told, and a story can be told in many languages. The interesting thing about Valkyrie is that it shows a slightly different perspective of the Germans then most movies do on this subject.After all,there were,in fact,at the time, individuals who didn't agree with Hitler's politics and all the terrible things he did and who fought against it, or in this case, died trying.For everyone who's interested in this historical period,Valkyrie is a must see, and for those who don't have much knowledge about it, here is a change to learn a little more and see a different take on some of the events that occurred. 7/10",Null,1,1,20 September 2009

Maybe this story(based on real events) just doesn't translate very well to the big screen.I think the film aspired to be great but felt short.On a more positive note, Jamie Foxx's performance was great and felt very authentic.6/10",Null,16,25,9 September 2009

Ryan flies around the US over 320 days of the year, which he feels is the best part of his job. A secondary job he has is to give motivational speeches on relieving one's life of excess physical and emotional baggage. Ryan's life may change when the company hires Natalie Keener, a young overachieving woman who recommends that the company change the nature of the work by conducting the 'firings' via remote computer access. Ryan believes that Natalie does not fully understand the nature of the business, and as such, their boss, Craig Gregory, suggests that she accompany Ryan on a business trip. Ryan is also trying to protect his way of life, which now includes meeting up with a woman named Alex Goran whenever their flight schedules mesh. Like Ryan, Alex, who he met in an airport hotel bar, is constantly traveling for work.Up in the Air is a well made, entertaining and quite enjoyable film. There's no doubt about that. It's poignant, quirky and balances extremely well comedic moments with more dramatic scenes. However, it's not a spectacular film by any means. And although it touches some pretty interesting subjects, the film is predictable and quite conventional following the same formula and using the same gimmicks that so many other films use. The message of the film is clear; Man need connection, people need other people in their lives, we need significant relationships to be happy. No matter how happy Ryan thought he was in the beginning of the film, leading his independent and carefree life, he eventually comes to the realization that, like everyone else, he too needs meaningful connections, either if it's a lover or a sister, doesn't matter. The performances were all extremely solid with Clooney being very charismatic as always and newcomer Anna Kendrick showing quite a bit of potential.And yes, the film also has a certain 'extra' relevance due to today's economy. There's millions of people loosing their jobs and the films shows a bit of how corporate America works and how ruthless it can be. There's no question that this is a film that deals with the real world, but again, there's nothing that impressive or striking about the film. And let it be perfectly clear that I enjoyed the film very much but, having said that, I would expect a film nominated for 6 Oscars to be outstanding. And I could address the fact that today the Oscars are nothing but a joke but that's a completely different subject. In conclusion, Up in the Air is a well made film, with a good script and solid performances. Just not what it's made out to be.7/10",Null,5,8,16 February 2010

'V' is a mysterious man fighting for freedom while Evey is a news reporter who unwillingness joins V's quest. What I'm not so fond of is the poetically almost theatrically way things happen. It doesn't feel real.I have to mention the stunning Natalie Portman that once again has proved her value as an actress. Deserving of a spot in the Top250 ?Not even close.
