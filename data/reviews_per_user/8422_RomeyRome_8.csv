The Sound of Music," My FAVORITE movie of all time!!!
","You know, they just don't make movies like this anymore. 'Moulin Rouge' huh, you call that music? 'Chicago', Renee and Catherine can go suck an egg! Julie Andrews had a beautiful voice that is unmatched in this day and age as far as musical films are concerned. It's sad that she cannot sing anymore because of her throat surgery but she is still a great actress. The movie has it all with a great soundtrack that I will never forget the words to. Every song on this movie is a song that is full of life and is enjoyable to listen to. So take time from your busy lives to stop what you're doing, close your eyes and listen, I mean REALLY LISTEN. SSSssshhhh, do you hear that? THE HILLS ARE ALIVE.........................",10,1,7,4 July 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Aaarrrggghh, I love the ocean I love the sea, it's a Pirate's life for meeeee!!!
","This movie is GREAT! Depp has depth and he proves it wonderfully in this film. I think that Depp is a very good actor who has come a long way in his career. I have admired him since he did 'Edward Scissorhands' which is still one of my favorite movies. Anyhoo, Orlando Bloom did a good job as Bootstrap but I don't see why all these girls think he's so hot. Oh well, his love interest is the one that's REALLY HOT!!! Keira Knightley completely lights up the screen when she's doing her thing. Okay enough about the actors, back to the movie. The movie has a great story and it sails like the Loveboat without as much love. It has great pacing and the costumes and CG are awesome as well! YOU GOTTA SEE THIS PICTURE!!! Ahoy mateys, the ship's going to sail and it's time to wail!!!!",8,0,1,1 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE.
","Man I cannot begin to tell you how good this movie is. This movie blew me away from the first frame to the last. I was so engaged when I first saw this movie, in the theater, that I denied myself a bathroom break until the film was completely over. Reasons, okay you want reasons why you should go see this? Well how about cinematography, writing, acting, directing, computer graphics, adventure, drama, awesome action, and just all-the-way-around-the-world and back FUN!!!! Do not, and I repeat DO NOT deny yourself a viewing of this wonderful and fantastically made movie. It's a GREAT film, period. What are you waiting for? Are you still reading this, go see it, hurry..........GO!!",10,1,2,4 July 2003
Spider-Man," Spidey is Petey and M.J.'s a sweety, but Goblin is scary and creepy!
","I LOVE SPIDER-MAN! Okay, I know I've already commented on this movie but I just want to reiterate the fact that this movie is very enjoyable. I watched it on opening weekend in a movie theater in Los Feliz, California. Needless to say I was awe-struck!!! The movie's story stays mostly true to the comics with just a few exceptions. I liked the relationship between Peter Parker and Norman Osborn as well. There was a lot to like about this film. It had drama, humor, action, and lots of wonderful visuals to behold. I really hope that they include the menacing villain named Venom in the upcoming sequels. I know the perfect person to play Venom........................ME!!! Yep, if anyone could pull off the Eddie Brock character it's me. I could definitely learn to hate Spider-man, but only in the movies because I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. Alright, anyhow go watch this fantastic film and see the wall-crawler do his slinging and swinging. I cannot wait to catch the sequel to this movie. In the words of Uncle Ben......remember.....'With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!'",10,1,1,20 July 2003
Spider-Man," Spidey's Feature Film debut is AMAAAAAAAZING!!!
","I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. You can't ask for anything more from a super-hero action flick. This movie's got it all! The acting is excellent, the action is HOT, and the Goblin is deliciously evil! The cinematography, the directing, and the script are superb. Peter Parker is a hero's hero. I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. Just a couple of gripes but nothing too serious. I thought that the CG could have been better, but hey, these animators are barely scratching the surface with this new technology. Give it a few more years and we'll be in for quite a treat. I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. One more gripe, what the hell was up with Kirsten Dunst's hair? That red was very wrong for her. Anyways, that's it. All the other super-heroes out there, Superman, Daredevil, Wolverine, etc. probably have Spider-man posters hanging on their walls. They look up to your friendly neighborhood Spider-man. That's right, Spider-man is #1 BABY!!! Oh and did I mention? I LOVE SPIDER-MAN!!!!",10,1,1,19 July 2003
28 Days Later...," 28 Dongs Later...
","Dude, this movie like started out with WAY TOO MUCH DONG! I mean there was like a monkey tied down to a table with wires and stuff connected to him. This all takes place in like some science laboratory and stuff. Then you got like these activists that come in to try and save all of the monkeys. However, 28 days later..........BOOOOOOOM......it's like Dong City dude. The main character's like dongin' everywhere. There's like dong all over the screen. I mean for almost 5 whole minutes this guy's dongin' like there's no tomorrow. He's like totally donged out. Besides all that it's a pretty cool flick. Just a little too much unnecessary dong time. It's worth at least one look. Be very careful though, or else there may be bad dongs in your future. After you watch this movie your dongs may be numbered!!!",Null,0,0,10 July 2003
Clash of the Titans," Just flat-out BAD, as in, BAD.
","I wish they hadn't remade this movie at all. It's completely insulting to the original. The acting was wooden, the dialogue matched it, and every sequence was just plain neutrally subpar, LOL. This movie was truly tragic in every sense. I hope that Hollywood doesn't think that they're going to get by with putting out rubbish in 3-D. We're on to you Hollywood, the jig is up. Please don't insult your audience and for the sake of all that is worthy, STOP DESTROYING THE CLASSICS!!! Hollywood, you could have easily taken upon countless other stories of Greek Mythology and tried to be fresh and different without compromising the greatness of the original 'Clash of the Titans'. Instead, you were too concerned about lining your pockets. SAD, SAD, SAD. Hmm, it's getting' close to the tax deadline. Can I write off my expenses for watching this trash? Of course not.Thank you Hollywood for another display of glorified poop. You wanna kick my dog while you're at it?",1,34,58,6 April 2010
The Red Violin," This movie is, REAL!
","What more can I say? This movie has drama, suspense, and an awesome cast. The tune that is the theme throughout the movie is eerie and kind of creepy...................I LIKE IT!!! Anyhoo, check this film out because I said so and because you WILL like it. Peace & Love peoples, OUTTRO.",8,0,0,4 July 2003
