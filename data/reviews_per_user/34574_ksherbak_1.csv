50 First Dates," A charming movie
","A sweet, charming movie that will probably appeal more to women than men. There is something attractive about Adam Sandler. The ultimate 'Average Joe', he is adorable and his obvious 'nerdiness' makes him extremely sexy. Drew Barrymore is refreshing and the chemistry between she and Adam is very similar to 'Wedding Singer'. A true romantic comedy, there is as much comedy as romance. The soundtrack, a mixture of Hawaiian pop, adds to the movie.'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' should be Many memorable lines. 'Can I have one last first kiss?' is the best line in the movie. I laughed. I cried. I recommend this movie to every one...even if you have all the love you need.",8,1,2,4 March 2006
