Skyfall," Worst movie ever of the Bond franchise
","If anyone reads this: please don't watch this movie, it's not worth your time or your money, and I'm serious. Let me provide a short list that could explain to you why.<ul><li>The plot lacks common sense, actually whoever wrote this script should be shot immediately: the whole story is based on the fact that a list of undercover agents went missing (this idea has been overused in spy movies since Mission Impossible anyway). The funny thing is, that in the end, the viewers were never told what happened with the disc...</li></ul><ul><li>The 'Bond girls' look too thin, and they are uninteresting, except for the best looking one: but she is on screen for only 10-15 minutes or so, and she dies when you'd start to think she's be involved in the story further. Shame...</li></ul><ul><li>James Bond looks old, which they did on purpose of course to show that the world evolved since the ages of cold war / secret service etc. but they overdid it a bit.</li></ul><ul><li>The villain, played by Javier Bardem, had no chance to evolve/develop and turn into a character worth remembering: he only had a couple of scenes where he had a conversation with someone or talked at all. And oddly he reminded me of the Joker from the Batman series sometimes, with his laughs and funny faces, but again, the whole thing looked forced and lacked life.</li></ul><ul><li>James Bond used to dislike M, his boss, and declined her orders in previous movies. Now he's not only trying to save her, but he started to look at her like she was his own mother or something. She died in his hands, and Bond was crying... Bond went completely emo.</li></ul><ul><li>The ending with the battle at the old house from Bond's childhood lacked any sense. The bad guys go straight into the house without any care for traps? Bond and company using old shotguns, rifles, whatever against a helicopter with machine guns? Really? Then when M and that old guy escape in the tunnel and return back to the surface they use flashlight just to be noticed in the dark instead of trying to escape unnoticed? When Bond escapes through the tunnel why did he leave to door open? Let me guess: so that he has to outrun the blast of the explosion, right?</li></ul><ul><li>Ralph Fiennes had like 10-15 minutes on screen, and played only a minor role. I don't blame him, he shouldn't have been involved in this movie at all.</li></ul><ul><li>No 007 gadgets, no real humor, forced jokes, and uninteresting conversations all over this movie.</li></ul><ul><li>There were some nice views/landscapes in the movie, but they were showing them for too long, like we were supposed to be amazed, and not focus on the boring story.</li></ul>If they were trying to kill this franchise once and for all, if that was the real goal of making this movie, I think they did a great job. I saw potential in Daniel Craig as James Bond in 'Casino Royal', but ever since then, both of his Bond movies were garbage. (Needless to say, this is not even comparable to Casino Royale, of course.) Daniel Craig just proved us that he's one of the most boring James Bonds ever.After the lights turned on in the cinema, and I looked around, I haven't seen one smiling face or satisfied moviegoer. By the way, in the final seconds of the movie, it said that James Bond will return shortly. Well I hope this Bond won't.",2,36,84,26 October 2012
The Dark Knight," Not really what people expected...
","I have to say the hype about this movie was much bigger than it should have been. I found it quite confusing that the story was quite hard to follow and the cutting was not good at all in my opinion.Christian Bale didn't deliver again, for me he doesn't seem like a good actor at all, you can actually see that he's just trying to act in most of his scenes, nothing original there, he's just saying the lines he has to say. Almost no emotions at all. And it was quite funny how drastically his voice changed when dressed as Batman, it was ridiculous.The only thing (the only person) who saved this movie in my opinion was Heath Ledger, his performance was quite good, he was intense, you really felt entertained when he stepped on the scene. Watching him play as the Joker was the only good part of this movie in my opinion. he actually sort of waked me up when he appeared, those where the only parts of the movie when everybody was strictly paying attention to what was happening.And I don't really know why didn't they stick with Katie Holmes as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal to me wasn't pretty at all, and she's not as good as Katie anyway... That was so disappointing for me.To sum up things, there were couple of good scenes in the movie, but it was too long. And if you feel like the movie is too long, that means the viewer loses interest in the story while watching, well that's what happened to most of the viewers in the cinema as far as I saw it. The flow of the movie was also not really good, it was hard to stay focused what was exactly happening in some scenes and why was it happening that way.Even Batman Begins was better than this movie...",5,8,16,11 August 2008
