The Avengers," Don't believe the hype
","This film is entertaining. It is fun and has some amusing lines but at the end of the day is nothing more than the culmination of a marketing scheme started in 2008 with the Iron Man film. I didn't like that film then, felt like Spiderman with a different coat of paint and this one feels like X-men. Yes there's stunts and action but lets be honest Scarlett Johansen looks like she's working out what to buy with her fee throughout the entire thing, the 3-D effects were awful bar the flying arrow at the end and Samuel L Jackson is there to merely spout expositionary dialogue more at home in a Saturday morning kids cartoon. There will be more, it will make a fortune in a world where whole first world countries are going bankrupt and it will be forgotten in about one years time.",7,2,7,15 May 2012
Aliens," A true rarity....
","Aliens, James Cameron's 1986 sequel to Alien;is one of the few sequels in film history which improves upon its predecessor.Whereas the 1979 original focused on a tense suspense driven approach to horror, Aliens is structured as a war film in space. Still providing horror but now mixed with action; Aliens would be the ideal young, testosterone driven, macho male film if not for its leading character being Ripley (the sole human survivor of the original), a woman who learns to hold her own amongst all the bravado of the colonial marines. I remember renting this film frequently from my local video shop in the late eighties, it really stands well to repeat viewing given the amount of quotable lines it features. It's such a shame that the two sequels never once revisited the quality of either this or the afore-mentioned Alien.",10,0,2,9 July 2004
The Dark Knight," technically stunning, a complete triumph.
","I saw Batman begins in the theatre back in 2005 and was astonished at how much enjoyment I had with the experience. The follow up, hinted at by the revelation of the playing card at the finale being the perfect teaser for the film which followed. Experiencing this at an Imax theatre for the first time I was absolutely blown away. In almost every beautifully shot scene the audience is constantly reminded of the scale and grandeur of the city. The film has an excellently structured plot with enough twists and turns to make one completely forget the somewhat bizarre premise and every cast member invests enough energy to make the audience suspend disbelief. A special mention must go to the brilliant script, stunts and wit of some performances. It will be a miraculous achievement if Christopher Nolan can top this one. An absolute gem of a film.",9,3,8,26 July 2008
Speed," Great genre film.Err....**spoilers?**
","Speed is really a great example of the action thriller genre.Although it lacks a deep narrative or fascinating characters, it succeeds well in what it was made to do, entertain. The hero characters are played by Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, in one of his few good roles. Keanu pulls of the action hero very well in this film, and Sandra Bullock appears as a likable heroine who has more to do than scream as people are killed around her. Dennis Hopper also stars as the deranged bomber, delivering a classic line; 'No Jack. Poor people are crazy, I'm eccentric!' He seems larger than life, probably due to his low screen time. Overall well worth seeing, but the sequel was poor.",8,4,7,7 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The definitive blockbuster sequel.....
","How do you top Star Wars? A global phenomenon, one of the most successful films of all time, a fantastic film for the whole family. In 1980, the characters from Star Wars return as fully-fledged heroes about to taste the wrath of Darth Vader and the emperor. In this classic sequel, we have new locations and new characters. A truly spectacular battle on an icy plain and the introduction of Yoda. The joy in seeing Han Solo and Princess Leia's bickering relationship blossom into romance and Luke Skywalkers realisation of his destiny to battle the dark lord Vader are unforgettable.With a cliffhanger climax which leaves you wanting more.",10,0,1,22 August 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A bit controversial.....
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade...........I first saw that this film was in the works around December 1987 when Temple of Doom was receiving its Uk TV premiere. I really enjoyed Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and its sequel was good fun but not as much as the first film. Then in summer 1989 I saw the third film and I was severely disappointed.Gone where the scary special effects to be replaced by Sean Connery's character who does provide some great comedy. I just couldn't enjoy this one as much as the other two as I'm afraid it really feels like a straight sequel to Raiders where the writers try to recreate the action sequences of the first film. Unfortunately, Indiana Jones seems to to have peaked with his first outing as both Temple Of Doom and Last Crusade are just not better than the original. Unlike Star Wars, where the second film is clearly better. I really think that George Lucas lost something since 1981...I haven't enjoyed any of his work since more than Raiders, Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back.",7,0,0,24 July 2004
