Source Code," Beautiful concept.
","The concept of this movie is absolutely beautiful. It took me two viewings to finally get that. The 93 minutes of intense plot is secondary to the beautiful messages that underlie this film.Without getting too much into detail, it provides another perspective on life that is hard to imagine. A perspective you might only realize once you're dead. How every moment is precious, and why everything will always be all right in the end.Go pickup this movie now. You won't regret it. And if you're lucky to keep your eyes open, you might just never look at life with the same set of eyes again.",8,0,0,15 January 2019
Good Will Hunting," We all need a little guidance
","After a second viewing of this film, I give it a solid 8. Open yourself and be vulnerable before you watch this film, and it will humble you.We all need a little guidance in our lives, and we might not know as much as we think we do about the lives of others. This is just one of the many lessons this movie shares.",8,1,2,10 July 2018
La La Land," Majestic, enchanting and delightful... and that's an understatement.
","La La Land starts off with an odd piece- imagine the busiest highway in your city suddenly turning into a sing-along, with everyone dancing outside of their cars. Shortly after that, it bursts into a classic, magical film laced with love, the freight of dreams, and the will to not give up on them.I was a little bit skeptical at first not having been a huge fan of musicals in the past-- but I was very wrong. It's more of a movie then a musical. The musical, as I think about it, is just the cherry on top of an already brilliant script. La La Land is filled with those simultaneous conflicts between dreams and reality-- hence the singing, and the musical aspect of the film. This makes it for the dreamers and the realists alike.Do you want to make your dreams come true, but you're dealing with some internal conflicts? Then this movie is for you. If you don't care about dreams, this movie is still for you.",8,2,2,19 May 2018
