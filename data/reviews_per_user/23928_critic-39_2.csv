The Blair Witch Project," Three students disappear in the woods making a documentary about a witch in
","In 1994, students Heather, Josh and Mike disappeared without trace in the remote Maryland woodlands while making a documentary about the Blair Witch; a local legend. A year later their film and sound recording gear is finally found and their raw colour and black and white film footage is pieced together revealing their horrific experience.Blair Witch is an extremely clever movie in that it has a simple story line and execution.What makes this an unsettling and terrifyingly real horror movie so authentic is that the film was shot ... by the actors ... using handheld cameras, video and DAT sound recording gear.The film has a very raw, live action, impromptu doco feel.
Noticeably, is the absence of the third person narrator - in this case the film crew, incidental music, fancy camera angles and special effects.
One warning: if you suffer from motion sickness, this movie can make you feel extremely nauseaous - due to jerky, the on-the-run film footage.The mysterious stick figures in the woods; the disturbing appearance of the piles of rocks; the late night woods sounds and noises of distress; and the plunging headling into chilling pitch black pursuing the pitiful Josh, build to the final abandoned house scene - combining the three legends - the Blair Witch; the Coffin Rock murders and the grizzly basement murders.4/5",Null,0,0,13 December 1999
Toy Story 2," Woody gets toynapped by a rare toy collector and Buzz Lightyear and friends rescues him.
","Rarely does the sequel exceed the original but Pixar/Disney have managed a follow-up that will entertain and amaze.In Toy Story we learned that when humans aren't around, toys have a secret life and they are devoted to their owners (despite breaking and outgrowing them).Toy Story introduced us to Andy and his two favourite toys - Woody the cowboy and Buzz Lightyear the spaceman.In Toy Story 2, when Andy's mum decides to have a garage sale (yard sale), while Andy goes on summer camp, she throws out Squeaky penguin.Woody attempts to make a daring broad-daylight rescue but inadvertently gets toynapped by a avaricious collector who needs Woody to complete his hard-to-find Woody and Cowboy Friends toy set.Buzz Lightyear identifies the culprit as Al from Al's Down Town Toy Mart and along with Slinky Dog, Rex Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Potato Head, decides to rescue him....What ensues is a hilarious adventure involving crossing busy city streets, a tour of Al's toy mart, getting up to Al's penthouse apartment and a daring rescue from the local airport.An added complication is that Woody discovers he was once a famous TV cowboy and he meets, for the first time, the other long forgotten character toys from that show. He must decide whether he wants to become a museum piece in Japan, or go back to Andy.***Toy Story 2 has everything - action, humour, wonderful characters and a great story! There IS something here for everyone - especially the adult chaparones with lots of hilarious references to Star Wars, Jurrasic Park, Superman, Bugs Life and even movie related merchandising.9/10",Null,0,0,19 December 1999
