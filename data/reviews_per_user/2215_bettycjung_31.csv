Blade Runner 2049," Good sequel, but a bit long
","10/8/17. Saw this in the theater today, in 2D. This has the same moodiness as the original, and it ran a bit long. They probably could have shaved off a half-hour without necessarily compromising the story. This movie was more of a showcase for the fantastic special effects they spent a ton of money on. So, if you liked the first one, you will probably like this. If you like Gosling and Ford, then definitely catch this!",7,2,7,8 October 2017
Vertigo," A good example of Hitchcock's psychological thrillers
","12/5/17. This Hitchcock psychological thriller is a National Film Registry pick. Like many classics from the past, this film was not well received but has passed the test of time. Stewart is a detective who becomes obsessed with a woman (Novak) he has been asked to follow. However, the viewer never knows exactly what Novak's intentions are as they become somewhat involved. Worth catching.",7,1,1,9 December 2017
Come and See," Why we must pray for peace all the time
","5/18/18. Probably one of the most graphic anit-war film you will ever watch. Though brutal all the way through, and if you can stomach the atrocities, this film will make you rethink the reason why we must pray for peace all the time so men won't have the opportunity to act out the cruelty shown in this movie. As seen through the eyes of a 13 year-old, it is unbearable to watch what he had to go through and they commit unmentionable acts of genocide. The end sequence in which he tries to turn back the hands of history is as surreal as the atrocities he had to witness and incredibly live through. According to Roger Ebert, the experiences of the co-writer of the script, Ales Adamovich was used to inform the film. Worth watching, but it will be rough if you have a heart. And, you will never look at a cow the same way after seeing this movie.",8,1,2,19 May 2018
Friday Night Lights," Now watch Varsity Blues
","4/4/18. If you like football movies, then you will probably like this one. It's based on a true story about a Texas high school football team during the year BEFORE they went on to win the state championship. It follows 5 senior players as they try to play their best to win for the coach. However, my favorite football movie is Varsity Blues, which came out 5 years before this movie. While VB was fiction, it pretty much depicted the same kind of issues that were depicted here. And, because it was fiction you do get the chance to cheer for the underdogs who had the worst coach ever (Voight) on the silver screen. Watch VB and I am sure you will agree that VB is much more inspirational and spot on in depicting the southern football culture in which men view football as their masculinity at play.",6,0,0,4 April 2018
Wind River," Inhospitable terrain complicates investigating a murder on a Wyoming Indian reservation
","8/27/17. Great murder mystery. What great cinematography! The story is slow but satisfying. Olsen is a green FBI agent sent to investigate the death of a teenage girl found frozen on an Indian Reservation. She recruits Renner, a Fish and Wildlife tracker (I didn't know there was such a job that hunters would probably like) who hunts to keep the wildlife at manageable levels to help her. If you like murder mysteries, you will probably like this one. The entire cast did a fine job. Beware that there are grisly scenes, sexual assault and shootouts that may not be suitable for those under 17.",7,3,8,28 August 2017
Wind River," Renner and Olsen were great. Worth catching
","8/27/17. Saw this in the theater today and it was really great! What great cinematography! The story is slow but satisfying.

She recruits Renner, a Fish and Wildlife tracker (I didn't know there was such a job that hunters would probably like) who hunts to keep the wildlife at manageable levels.

Darkest Hour," Oldman does a great job as Churchill
","2/27/18. A decent docudrama that captures the charisma of Churchill as he rallies a whole country to stand up against Nazi aggression. Not exactly a nice man by any standard, but then would a nice prime minister do what he did? Great inspirational speeches. Worth catching.",7,0,3,1 March 2018
Deadpool 2," Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds
",5/20/18. Ryan Reynolds will always play Ryan Reynolds. Do not expect any logical plot other than love conquers all. A totally insane movie that's meant to be enjoyed as a popcorn extravaganza with plenty of special effects and mind numbing violence and action. Total summer fare.,7,0,3,20 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor Rocks!
","11/5/17. Saw this in the theater today in 2D. What a fun movie to watch on the big screen. What made this work was it didn't take itself too seriously, and neither did the audience. Lots of good special with an above average script with decent acting all around. Blanchett just blew me away as the big sister who really could rule Asgard, but only to the detriment of everyone who does not accept her rule. After this, you really have to believe that she really could play anything. Worth catching.",8,3,6,5 November 2017
Ready Player One," Spielberg gets back into the game with one!
","4/1/18. Saw this in the theater today in 2D and worth seeing on the big screen. If you are not a gamer or not still in your teens, then all the visuals may be a bit over-stimulating and overwhelming. Really, no wonder kids can sleep or calm down these days! Anyway, Spielberg paints a very dismal dystopia in which everyone escapes into a virtual world known as Oasis because reality is just so bad. Rylance is the creator of Oasis and upon his death he promises wealth,glory and control of Oasis to the person who can solve his puzzle and win 3 keys to his kingdom. That's the basic premise. Spielberg is back in the game with this movie. He has managed to make a movie that is appealing to the Post-Millennials and well as the Millennial and Generation X. However, Baby Boomers will definitely enjoy all the references to pop culture from the last 40 years that only people who have been around for decades can really appreciate. Worth watching and rewatching to catch all the pop references. And, don't be deceived, Spielberg is still leery about Technology, just catch the last few minutes and you'll know what I mean.",8,15,32,2 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," Tonya Harding gets her chance to tell her side of the story
","1/21/18. Saw this today in the theater and it was worth seeing on the big screen. Janney and Robbie were phenomenal as the dysfunctional mother-daughter act that basically ruined the life of Tonya Harding. The movie was well-done and tried to make sense of the messed up memories of everyone involved with the clubbing of Nancy Kerrigan. While Harding was not viewed as an American sweetheart, she was very much a child of America's heartland, home of the working class. It was hard watching Harding being continuously abused by her mother and then her husband, but this is her story. Despite it all, Harding was a talented skater who never got the break that would have put her up where she belonged - the winner's circle. Worth catching. Hopefully, Robbie and Janney will get some recognition during movie awards time for their portrayals.",8,1,2,22 January 2018
Molly's Game," Not as good as Casino, but worth watching for Chastain's Molly
","4/11/18. This was a pretty good docudrama based on Molly's memoir. Though not as good a Casino (the movie to beat about gambling), it was entertaining as Molly does the voice over narrating what was happening. That was helpful to follow what was going on. Chastain was really good a Molly, a smart woman who had daddy issues, all the while trying to prove she was worthy of her father's love. What I found a bit unbelievable is that she managed to go it alone for so long before she started making bad decisions and getting involved with the Russian mob. Nevertheless, a cautionary tale that the house always wins. Elba was really good as the lawyer to takes on her case.",7,0,1,12 April 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," McDormand is in fine form
","12/3/17. I got a free ticket to see this but I wasn't sure if I would like it. That's because in recent years McDormand has been playing the bitter older woman,unhappy with life. However, she was a surprise in this. Though she continued in the vein of the unhappy older woman she is somewhat subdued in her anger over the stalled investigation into her teen daughter's death. However, she has enough anger to launch a publicity campaign against the police department, in particular, the police chief who has his own health issues to deal with. The film is basically a slice of life of small town USA and does not paint a very pretty picture of small town living. Worth catching.",7,37,77,3 December 2017
Baby Driver," Watch it for the car chases
","11/17/17. Maybe 2 1/2 stars. If you love car chase movies, then this one's for you. All the bad guys just come off as bad caricatures of real bad guys. So, the story line was not that original and almost everyone is annoying to some point except for Elgort who plays the title's Baby Driver. One is never too sure about Baby's intellect, given his psychological issues from a horrific childhood. But, he's sure a cool driver and music rules his life like nothing else. Enjoy the car chases, they were amazing, and soundtrack was pretty cool, especially the very last song of the movie.",6,4,7,18 November 2017
Justice League," Justice League off to a promising start. Wonder Woman continues to rock!
","11/19/17. Saw this in 2D in the theater. A good movie to watch on the big screen. Not sure if it would be worth paying for 3D as there was enough good action as it is. I originally decided to watch this because Gal Gadot would be in it, and she's on a roll, even though the Batman vs. Superman movie was probably the most stupidest comic book superhero movie ever. So, this movie exceeded my expectations. Very smart for them to start off with Wonder Woman in action and then slowly develop an origins-based introduction to the less known characters. I really like Miller's take on the Flash. His earlier movies play to his choices of quirky and troubled teen roles. Here he is a kid who feels so lucky to be in the presence of all these super-heroes. I also like his somewhat PG-13 adoration of Wonder Woman. All in all, the Justice League is off to a promising start. If they can try and keep it a little more serious than cartoon-y I think potential Justice League sequels will do well,. Although I still find it somewhat strange to see Affleck as Batman, although he is much, much better in this one that in the previous stupid one.",8,0,2,19 November 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," The movie to end all movies - NOT!
","5/5/18. If there could ever be a 'final' super-hero movie to end all such movies, then this would have been the one. But we all know that that isn't going to ever happen. The MCU is just too lucrative to ever end, especially when these movies continue to rake in millions. The body count is enormous, but keep in mind no blood was spilled, just dust blowing in the wind, and I didn't see any tears shed because it just isn't so - they will all rise again! Worth catching..",9,1,3,8 May 2018
A Quiet Place," A great suspense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat!
","4/8/18. Saw this in the theater today. Wow, what a great suspense thriller! Very little dialogue, mostly visual that commands your total and undivided attention. After this, Emily Blunt can pretty much play anything and pull it off. Here she is a mother who knows how to take care of her kids and give birth despite overwhelming odds. Krasinski, who also directed, is the man of the house but is constantly challenged in his role as a father. Definitely worth catching. A creature feature that will put chills up and down your spine.",8,4,9,9 April 2018
Coco," Celebrating the power of connecting to one's past
","12/7/17. Saw this in the theater today, and so glad I did! What a wonderful celebration of the power of music and the Mexican tradition of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead)! While it may seem morbid for those not familiar with this celebration, I think it is a wonderful way to take 3 days to celebrate the memories of loved ones who have died, and the healing power of having a connection with one's past. Wonderfully done, with a little plot twist to keep the adults entertained, this movie is worth catching.",8,0,2,10 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Saga Continues...
","12/30/17. Finally got to see this in the theater. It was worth seeing on the big screen. While it doesn't break any new ground, it does manage to keep the Star Wars story going. Unfortunately, it does work towards eventually leaving the Star Wars universe with only the new and younger characters it has introduced in what is the third trilogy of Lucas's original concept. On that note, none of the newer/younger characters have what I would consider a charismatic hold on the audience like Solo, Leia and Skywalker. Well, possibly, Ridley, but that's about it. Still I look forward to the Episode 9 in a couple of years.",7,1,5,30 December 2017
Castle in the Sky," A classic not to be missed!
","3/27/18. In a word - an animation classic. If you love animated movies, then this one is a must-see. Directed by Japan's greatest animation director - Miyazaki.",7,0,0,28 March 2018
The Shape of Water," True love knows no bounds
","12/24/17. Saw this in the theater today and it was worth the price of admission. For those who remember the Creature from the Black Lagoon, then this one's for you. It's a sequel that was well worth the wait. Well, it's not exactly a sequel, it's more like a theme in variation. It's a love story of strange proportions, that is worthy of del Toro's imagination. Hawkins is a sad woman of a certain age, who does janitorial duty at an oceanic research facility. She does not speak, but she can hear. She falls in love with a creature dragged in my Shannon's character. And, typical of sci-fi/creature features of the '50s, anything that is not human deserves to die. Hawkins makes it her mission to save the creature while falling in love with it. Implausible? Sure. Romantic? Absolutely. Catch it for Hawkins's star turn. Let's hope she wins something for this role.",8,25,46,25 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," Makes you almost want to see The Room...
","3/13/18. To be fair, I haven't seen 'The Room' but the scenes from the original movie (playing at the end of the move) seem to suggest Franco wanted to be as accurate as possible. This is an adaptation of Sistero's book,'The Disaster Artist' which recounts the friendship between Sistero and Wiseau and how they went on to make 'The Room' which ended up being a cult classic. When I think of cult classic, I am thinking 'Rocky Horror Picture Show,' which is hardly in the same category as The Room. Still, this was nicely done movie with guest appearances from current Hollywood well-knowns.",6,0,1,14 March 2018
American Made," Only Cruise could have pulled this off!
","10/23/17. Maybe even 7 1/2 stars! A highly entertaining biopic of Barry Seal, the talented pilot who made billions working for both sides: the CIA and the Medellin drug cartel. Cruise did a fantastic job playing Seal with just the right amount panache to make him a sympathetic character who knew enough to take advantage of his good fortune until his luck ran out. Truly an incredible true story that is worth telling, and Liman told it very well! Worth catching.",7,2,5,23 October 2017
12 Strong," A secret (and successful) mission to take down the Taliban post-9/11
","5/16/18. A nicely done retelling of the little known horse soldiers sent to fight the Taliban post-9/11 in Afghanistan. Basically a feel-good movie about a successful mission in which all 12 sent to complete the mission did so in record time (3 weeks). If you like war movies, you'll probably like this. And, if you like Chris Hemsworth, then that's all the more reason to watch this.",6,1,2,17 May 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Watch this but catch the 1974 version with Finney and Bacall
","11/12/17. Saw in the the theater and sadly I felt asleep half way. While the scenery was wonderful, the costumes extraordinary and the acting was at the level you would expect from this stellar cast, for some reason it just didn't resonate at all. While this has been remade a couple of times, I thought that the 1974 rendition with Finney and Bacall was much better for atmosphere. See that one and I am sure you will agree. Still not a total waste of time to this.",5,1,4,12 November 2017
Black Panther," Worthy addition to the Marvel franchise
","3/11/18. Finally caught this on the big screen, and it was well worth it! Great cinematography, costumes and screenwriting, or everything that makes this a worthy Marvel franchise member. I really liked how Wakanda women know how to fend for themselves and protect others. They are strong role models for girls, and that's a really good thing to see in a super-hero movie (Wonder Woman is also another one!). I like how this movie celebrates the African culture as worthy of respect for its traditions. Worth catching!",8,5,9,12 March 2018
The Greatest Showman," Oscar-worthy for best picture
","4/17/18. Total entertainment! I had no idea that it would be such a great musical! After seeing this I have to say that this was Oscar-worthy. Or, it should have won an Oscar for best picture, and probably would have in some other year. Great singing by everyone (Ferguson was dubbed) with great colorful sets and wonderful characters. Worth watching by everyone! The DVD has a featurette which included all 56 minutes of the music.",8,2,6,18 April 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," Watch it for the singing...
","3/20/18. The supposedly third and final movie of the Pitch Perfect franchise is now a slick production. The sets and costumes look a whole lot more expensive. While the singing is as great as usual, the back stories are not as good as the first movie. If you've seen the first two and like the singing, then you will like this one, too.",6,0,1,21 March 2018
Casino," A Classic! Scorsese rocks!
","3/13/18. They definitely don't make movies like this anymore. This movie is a testament to how great a director Scorsese is, to keep you enraptured for 3 hours watching how 3 people self-destruct with Las Vegas as the backdrop. Based on the nonfiction book by Pileggi, who also wrote the screenplay (as well as the one for Goodfellas), it is really the history of the old Las Vegas Strip, when mobsters and the Mafia ran the everything. Definitely worth catching!",8,1,3,14 March 2018
Annihilation," Could have been better with better editing
","3/4/18. I saw this in the theater today. I was looking forward to seeing this as I love sci-fi but I found the movie could have been better with some editing. While the special effects were mind-blowing, the skipping back and forth will leave the viewer wondering when those interviews with Portman's character were taking place. The acting was decent, but the story could have been better told. Watch it if you love sci-fi and any of the actors.",6,2,6,4 March 2018
Born on the Fourth of July," One man's journey through the Vietnam war that irreparably changes him forever
","6/7/18. This was a really nicely done movie about Ron Kovic, a Vietnam vet who returns from the war paralyzed from the chest down. Reflecting the turbulent times of the '60s and '70s, Kovic must make sense of his patriotism to serve his country in an unpopular war, to getting such injuries that turn out to be life changing. More than anything else, this movie is about how one man reacted to the lack of recognition and respect by people of that time who were anti-war and lacked a complete understanding of what injured vets must go through to try and find their place back in American society. Much of Kovic's journey was one of self-discovery and self-recovery, and how he tried hard to raise awareness of the plight of damaged vets returning home to people who have no understanding of what it's like to fight and come back as a shadow of what they were before. Worth catching.",7,1,2,8 June 2018
