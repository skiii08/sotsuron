Come and See," good not equal for fun
","This film is 'must see' category. And it's clearly propaganda. A good one. An excellent one. If U looking for some eye-candy or funny tale it's not here. Nobody going to entertain You. But You can be sure, once You watch it, You will find feelings. And not a pleasure one. But hell as intensive. Personally I'v felt so much anger of helplessness i can describe.In ex/USSR there is and was a 'little' problem 'Few deaths - tragedy, millions - statistic' (Stalin don't said that BTW) I't common knowledge that Germans killed millions of russians in WW2, burned villages and ets. Common knowledge from one side, and unimaginable scale from over side. As match, as it loose it's own sense. That's why this film was shown to as many school-kids as possible in USSR at times.If U would see throw through comments here U will see that it mostly quite polar. 'Very good' or 'Very bad'. It's simple. It shows people who let themselves to feel the meanings of film, and who don't. I understand the second ones. It's not the feelings, U normally want to feel. To distant yourself is as natural as move the hand away from knife blade. And to people who says 'it is unlikely dramatized', 'I don't by it', ets, I should remind, that author live himself through such as these. And what is shown was far not the cruelest that was in real history.'IDI I SMOTRY' helps to understand what is it means: 'ethnical cleaning','guerilla warfare' as good as it possible for film. U wanna know it? Come and see!P.S. I oftern see in reveiws 'it is unrealistic' and latest 'german soldiers not behave like that'. I'm 42years old Russians. Iknow at least 4 people PERSONALLY whos relatives survived under fire or saw how people were killed by german soldiers. As civilians. On purpose. By regular troops, not SS. Including my father when he was 4 year old.
German soldiers did behaved like that.",10,3,4,19 February 2009

","Good film. No demons, just people and their deeds. Especially good, when You know history a little. Know what these beautiful persons done. And why. And how other beautiful people move them on their way to hell. 'No more 1918!'. No more, for sure. Next should be film, where Hitler with nazi pull Germany from the knees. And it will be true. And finally the film, how Germany find itself on such knees after WW1. Or maybe film about poor Poland... in 1938 Chezh...It's time to stop to throw responsibility to Satan Hitler, and his satanic nazi slaves. 'In war such as this, there are no civilians'. Good words, except he forgot to meant the fact, who made that war 'such'.P/S Moment when secretary wear a helmet with lightnings was pretty funny. It was a big loss that she doesn't met soviet soldier, who would explain her all her ignorance, that such a helmet is not good protection.Been a bit disappointed with fact, that how many of them left Russia alive, afterwards. Unkle Joe was humanist for sure. Hope hitlerjugend kid was killed after - asshole killed 2 our tanks.",10,0,3,1 May 2012
