The Blair Witch Project," Too Much hype
","There was far too much hype surrounding this film to make it anything other than disappointing.  Having said that, it was ground breaking in the way it was made.  I felt the ad-libbed acting was too long at some points and the end left me confused, expecting another half an hour of horror.  Watch it ignoring the hype and you might just enjoy it",5,0,2,1 November 1999
