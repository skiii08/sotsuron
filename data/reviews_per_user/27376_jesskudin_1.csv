The Avengers," Utter drivel
","Superhero movies have been the craze for a while now. Sure, they've always been around, but now they seem to be coming out in droves. Either a new hero to make a movie for, yet another sequel to an existing series (Batman 1-3, Spiderman 1-3, Amazing Spiderman 1-2, Iron Man 1-3, Captain America 1-2, Thor 1-2, and the extensive X-Men series to name a few), or another reboot. Yes, they are popular, but for the most part extremely formulaic. Other than Nolan's Batman series there is not much new in any of those movies, and the Avengers is no different. Maybe even worse.Everything you expect to see in the Avengers, you will see. Some snappy one-liners from Downey Jr., explosions, an excessive use of CGI, good guys win, bad guys lose, dot dot dot. I think I've seen this one before. There is no creativity, no thought, nothing really. If you enjoy movies that require no thought, this one is for you.And the hype? I put this up there with the Fast & the Furious, it's THAT bad, yet so many people seem to love it. Are we really that unimaginative and dull? It's only exciting if you can't see past the CGI and battle scenes.If you would like to watch a 'superhero' movie with actual substance, Watchmen is a terrific example, they are the 'anti-Avengers' if you will. Enough with these cookie-cutter characters please. Don't waste your time on this one.",2,4,9,8 September 2014
