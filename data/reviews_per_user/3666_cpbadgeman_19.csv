Skyfall," Good but too dark
","Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 takes the 50 year-old franchise in a new direction but makes some significant sacrifices along the way. In this outing, Mr Bond has to retrieve a hard drive listing the cover of every MI6 agent on active service. Things get off to a great start with a fabulous chase scene over the rooftops of Istanbul. The film maintains a great pace through plot segments in London, Shanghai, and Macau also. However the final hour-or-so, though suspenseful, feels grim and anticlimactic. Bond's age and vulnerability are perhaps over-emphasized, and the silliness factor is significantly reduced. Overall, this is a good film and a more mature, world-weary spin on the James Bond character. Unfortunately, it's just not quite as much fun. Worth seeing all the same though.",7,0,2,2 January 2013
Terminator Salvation," Good but not great
","At last we have the long anticipated fourth installment of the 'Terminator' franchise. Has it been worth the wait? The answer to that question is one part 'yes', and one part 'well..maybe'. This one is set after the nuclear war at the end of T3, in the year 2018 to be exact, and the war between humans and the Skynet computer system is going at full-tilt.There are several different plot lines that don't really come together until the film's third act. The first centers on resistance leader John Connor (Christian Bale), who is involved in planning a major offensive against the machines but is also confronted by the dilemma of how to save the humans held prisoner at the Skynet facility that is to be his target. The second plot line centers on the mysterious Marcus Wright (Sam Robinson) and his journey from the ruins of Los Angeles to the HQ where Connor is based. The third plot introduces us to the teenage Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn's character from the first film) and his adventures with and without Wright. Finally, there is a half-developed love story between Wright and a pilot for the resistance played by Moon Bloodgood.It is no surprise that the action scenes are what consistently work best in this film, particularly in the first hour and in the climactic battle. Some of the chase scenes are simply breathtakingly exciting and the various machines that the characters have to battle are just awesome. The bleak post-nuclear landscape is strikingly depicted also. The middle part of the film sags quite badly however and the love story between Wright and Bloodgood seems forced and an obstacle to the progress of the bigger plot (which is pretty good otherwise). Another problem is that both Bale and Robinson bring a curious lack of charisma to their characters. It's hard to care about them and they both lack some of the humanity and vulnerability that made the previous films so exciting. All in all, this is a great popcorn movie and well worth seeing on the big screen. However it does not capture quite the same oomph that characterized it's predecessors.",7,1,2,25 May 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," Awe-inspiring zombie mayhem
","This is the third installment of the 'Resident Evil' franchise and is easily the best entry so far. We are told at the beginning that the T-Virus has wiped out humanity almost completely, devastated the ecosystem, and reduced the Earth to a desolate wasteland. Milla Jovavich returns as Alice, whose blood contains the antivirus that can save what is left of mankind. She convinces a group of fellow refugees, who are aimlessly wandering in the Nevada desert, that they should all travel to a rumored disease-free refuge in Alaska. However, the evil Umbrella Corporation has been searching for her and has plans of it's own..This is a genuinely scary, gut-wrenching horror film from beginning to end. The central characters are placed in one terrifying situation after another and at times the tension is almost unbearable. Likewise, the action sequences are incredibly intense, particularly an early encounter between Alice and a pack of undead attack dogs (a series trademark).The film generates an atmosphere of fearful anticipation of the sort that is only found in the best horror movies. There is a decent amount of gore and Alice's skill with knives anchors some fantastic set-piece battle scenes between the survivors and the undead. A special mention ought to also be given to the strikingly imaginative set designs, a case in point being the depiction of a ruined Las Vegas.Where the film shows weakness is in it's liberal, perhaps far too liberal, referencing of earlier classics especially George Romero's 'Day of the Dead', the 'Road Warrior', and even Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. The film stays true to the mythology about the 'Resident Evil' universe that was established in the preceding films and does not add too much that is really new.That having been said, in terms of generating pure exhilaration and intense fear 'Extinction' takes the franchise to new levels and is easily one of the very best zombie movies in years. The next chapter in the series has a lot to live up to.",9,35,69,24 September 2007
28 Weeks Later," Big thrills, huge plot-holes
","The first thing to note about this movie is that it is one of a very small group of films: a sequel that is as good as it's predecessor. However it excels in different ways, '28 Days Later' was primarily a psychological horror flick that examined how well-drawn characters who care for each other react to terrifying circumstances. '28 Weeks' is first and foremost an action movie loaded with large-scale effects-laden depictions of carnage.The plot is fairly straightforward- seven months after the outbreak of the Rage virus, an American military force has started the task of reconstructing Britain. In order to repopulate the country, the surviving Britons are housed in a military base established on the Isle of Dogs in London. These survivors include 12 year-old Andy and his teenage sister Tam, together with their father (the fantastic Robert Carlyle) who knows more than he is telling about the fate of their mother. All of the original 'infected' have starved to death, but it turns out that some people bitten during the epidemic never exhibited symptoms themselves but can still contaminate others. Needless to say, it's not long before all hell breaks loose and Andy and Tam- together with a U.S military doctor and an Army sniper- have to fight for their lives.Though '28 Weeks' has a different director, the film has a very similar look to it's predecessor with lots of jump-cuts and jittery photography during the action scenes. Locations and music are both used very effectively also. Like in all the best zombie movies, there really is a sense that nowhere is safe and nobody can be trusted. The whole film exudes a deep sense of dread and menace, danger seems to lurk everywhere even when it appears there ought to be nothing to fear. The pace of the film grows increasingly relentless and it is genuinely exhilarating to watch the characters struggle against ever-increasing odds in order to stay alive and escape to safety. The action set pieces are stunningly executed- particularly one involving a field full of infected and a swooping helicopter.However, all of this comes at price. The plot has some absolutely massive holes that most viewers will have no difficulty identifying. In '28 Weeks' things happen just because they do and necessary explanations are simply not provided. Having said that, this is a worthy sequel that provides lavish helpings of tension, exhilaration, and gore. Definitely worth seeing.",Null,2,5,14 May 2007
Trouble with the Curve," Excellent feel-good movie
","Despite announcing his retirement from acting some years back after appearing in 'Gran Torino', Clint Eastwood is at it again. This time around he plays Gus, an aging baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves who is concealing the fact that he is starting to lose his eyesight. Nonetheless he gets himself assigned to select their first-draft pick before (perhaps) being shunted into retirement by a younger generation who trust computers more than experience, knowledge, and intuition. Knowing that Gus is in trouble, his best friend (John Goodman) persuades his estranged daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to go on the road with him to North Carolina to help out. Mickey is a fanatic about baseball because it was her only way to connect with him during her childhood when he seemingly all but abandoned her after her mother died. The film then depicts how Gus and Mickey awkwardly try to rebuild what looks like an irreparably broken relationship. The plot has enough twists and turns to hold the viewer's attention and subtly highlights the central theme of how rewarding, complex, and difficult real human relationships can be. All the principals are in top form, including Justin Timberlake as a former draft of Gus' who is shooting for a job as a sports announcer, but Amy Adams is especially good- she delivers a perfectly tuned and moving performance. The strong supporting cast are excellent also. All in all this is a gently funny, unpretentious, and well-acted human drama with a big beautiful heart.",7,3,4,19 January 2013
The Hills Have Eyes," Right-on remake of an underground splatter classic
","I absolutely loved this remake of Wes Craven's gruesome 1977 original. The plot is very simple: a blandly average suburban family are stalked and besieged in the New Mexico desert by a clan of cannibals mutated due to radiation from A-bomb testing. Director Alexandre Aja very effectively builds the tension in the first half of the movie and then, with the skill of a surgeon, unleashes an avalanche of violence and brutality all the way until the closing credits. People aren't killed in this film, they are slaughtered. If you understand what I mean by this comment, then you'll likely enjoy this gore-soaked gem.Unusually for a horror movie, much of the action takes place in daylight. However this actually raises the suspense as it highlights both the desolation of the film's setting, and the primal nature of the struggle between the protagonists. The minimalist soundtrack is also strikingly effective. In short this is a vicious, first-class gut movie that attacks it's audience over and over again. An absolute must-see.",9,0,0,13 March 2006
Wanted," A whole lotta fun
","The latest offering from the Russian director of 'Nightwatch' is an exhilarating, effects-laden romp, that offers top-notch action but clearly does not take itself too seriously. The plot centers on an undistinguished office drone Wesley (James McAvoy) who is inducted by Fox (Angelina Jolie) into a secret brotherhood of assassins. Initially it seems that he was chosen to follow in the footsteps of the father he never knew, but of course things are not quite what they seem...There is no shortage of high velocity mayhem involving curving slow-mo bullets and spectacular vehicular acrobatics, particular kudos must go to an early scene involving a Dodge Viper. In addition, the script is smarter and funnier than what is usual for this type of film. The strong cast (which also includes Terence Stamp and Morgan Freeman) acquit themselves well and Ms. Jolie looks utterly divine- as always. All in all, this is an awesome popcorn movie that works extremely hard to entertain it's audience and, though violent, has a very hard time pulling it's tongue out of it's cheek. Definitely big summer fun.",7,2,6,30 June 2008
Shrek Forever After," Best Shrek yet
","This is the best 'Shrek' movie since the first one and is easily the funniest of the lot. This time around the plot revolves around Shrek developing a mid-life crisis and making a deal with the devious Rumpelstiltskin (the villain of the piece) to have one day of his single life back, he gets his wish but loses the day he was born in exchange. The rest of the movie follows how Shrek tries to get everything back to the way it used to be.All the ingredients that have made this franchise so popular are retained- particularly the clever pop culture references and the sharp interplay between all the main characters. The soundtrack is also very well-chosen and some of the selections are used to hilarious effect. All in all this is a very funny film from beginning to end and a top choice if you are looking for a lighthearted night out. Highly recommended.",8,2,5,31 May 2010
Control," Bleak, unflinching portrait of a genius
","In the history of popular music, Ian Curtis stands like a colossus. The music he created in collaboration with the other members of Joy Division met with limited commercial success initially but over the years has been massively influential on generations of musicians.Now we have 'Control', a brutally honest account of Ian's life. Shot entirely in black-and-white, the film oozes a deep arctic chill which successfully evokes the inner desolation that Curtis appears to have felt for much of his tragically short existence. The film moves at a brisk pace from his adolescence in uber-drab Macclesfield (outside Manchester) when he idolized David Bowie and Lou Reed, through the formation and rise of Joy Division, up to his suicide in 1980 aged 23.Newcomer Sam Riley pulls out all the stops in his portrayal of Curtis. He portrays him as in many ways a very ordinary young man blessed with an otherworldly talent, but also cursed by epilepsy and a savage depression that left him unable to express his love and need for those he cared about in any other way except through his music. However, the film is unafraid to portray him as being at times jealous, controlling, self-centered and dishonest- particularly in relation to the women in his life. In 'Control', Curtis is human, vulnerable- he makes mistakes, he lies and hurts the people who care for him the most. The film makes it clear just how much pain he inflicts on others, particularly after his death. But it is also shown that he carries immeasurable remorse and self-loathing for not being the person that he feels that he should be, and is also painfully aware of how much he can hurt the people he loves. His life is a battle- against epilepsy and the side effects of the medication he is given to control it, and also against an insanely deep existential hopelessness about himself.The supporting cast are nearly all outstanding in their portrayals of people who clearly value Ian beyond words but simply don't know how to reach him, or don't hear in his music his expressions of how much pain he is really in. The scenes where he performs 'Dead Souls' and 'Isolation' are truly heartbreaking in their depictions of a deeply anguished man who is basically screaming for help through his art, but cannot express those same feelings directly even to the people he loves the most.In conclusion, this is a deeply moving and truly honest depiction of one man's valiant struggle to cope with a life that overwhelms him. Obviously, there is a lot of Joy Division's music featured and it sounds simply stunning. Anton Corbijn's direction is restrained, low-key, and unobtrusive. He doesn't add any spin or tack-on morals onto Curtis' story but instead allows the audience to reach their own judgments.Ian Curtis gave the world so much, he fought until the end to see something other than darkness- yet even now continues to fill the lives of so many others with a deeply beautiful light. This film is a fitting tribute to a very human genius.Ian Curtis. 1956-1980. RIP",8,3,8,12 November 2007
Quantum of Solace," Strange title, strong action
","Daniel Craig's second outing as Agent 007 stays very loyal to the traditions for his tenure in the role that were established in 'Casino Royale'. Once again there are very few gadgets, very minimal humor, and a plot line that is (somewhat) more reality-based than has been the norm for the Bond franchise. The plot centers on Bond's efforts to avenge the death of his love interest in 'Casino', Vesper Lynd. This quest leads him to clash with a sinister philanthropist who wants to topple the Bolivian government, and also to ally himself with the beautiful Camille (Olga Kurylenko) who is seeking some vengeance of her own.Once again Craig exudes a winning combination of subtle vulnerability, smooth charm, and overt toughness. His character's demeanor is closer to that of the suave-but-thuggish operator described in the original novels. The action scenes are skilfully executed and there are a number of neatly twisted references to previous films in the Bond canon.Overall there is little to quibble with in this latest entry in a now decades-old franchise. However, at least one cool gadget (cellphones don't count!) would have gone a long way. In addition, a little more overt humor would have been appreciated and the title (which makes more sense as the plot unfolds) quite frankly sounds more like the tagline for a spa. All that having been said, 'Quantum of Solace' is good value for money and a fun night out.",7,1,4,17 November 2008
2012," Great campy fun
","It was pretty much inevitable that someone would make a movie based on all the 2012 hoopla. Nor is it surprising when that someone is disaster maven Roland Emmerich. His latest effort adheres closely to the formula established by his earlier films 'Independence Day' and 'The Day After Tomorrow'- in other words we get to watch a typically flawed-but-lovable American family (headed by John Cusack and Amanda Peet), along with a range of supporting characters, attempt to survive the end of the world.That's all there is to the basic plot. The real stars of the film are the truly spectacular special effects. Emmerich really pulls out all the stops and creates some truly awesome set-pieces of destruction. In order to ensure that the main characters have endless perilous situations to escape from, we get to see a bunch of natural and man-made wonders get totaled by Mama Nature. Highlights include Los Angeles falling into the sea, Las Vegas being swallowed by the desert, and the Himalayas being submerged by tidal waves.Improbable? Definitely. Ridiculous? You bet. But none of that matters since '2012' is exactly the film it was intended to be- a great big popcorn movie that offers big laughs, big thrills, and a lot of good old fashioned fun.",6,149,239,23 November 2009
Across the Universe," Sweet, imaginative, uneven musical
","One of the most surprising things about this lavish musical epic is the identity of the screenwriters: Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, the dynamic duo responsible for classic 1970s British sitcoms such as 'The Likely Lads' and 'Porridge'. Their latest effort 'Across the Universe' is a homage to the music of The Beatles that is breathtakingly ambitious and epic in scale. The plot is predictably threadbare, plucky young Liverpudlian dock worker Jude travels to America and is smitten by apple-pie-cute Lucy. But the path of true love never runs smoothly. Along the way we meet characters named JoJo, Sadie, Maxwell (is anyone noticing a theme here?), and...well, you get the idea.Visually, this film is plain gorgeous. The screen positively glows thanks to the use of a massive color palette that makes even grimy Liverpool look like it's covered in diamonds (sorry!). Frame by frame, much of 'Across the Universe' simply bursts with imagination. Ditto for the set design, choreography, and cinematography.However, there are downsides. At times the plot drags and some stretches of the film are somewhat dull. All the numbingly over-familiar totems of the 1960s (Vietnam, the Civil Rights movement, MLK etc.)are once again hauled out of the dusty closet of Boomer history and put through their tired paces- lest we forget that this overexposed decade is really the center of all recorded history as we know it. Only die-hard Beatles fans will likely appreciate the two-plus hour running time, as the extra musical bloat makes the whole affair seem agonizingly slow at times (though not often in fairness).All that having been said, 'Across the Universe' tries very hard to be liked and is mostly successful. It's best moments are really outstanding , such as the set pieces constructed around renditions of 'I am the Walrus' and 'Happiness is a Warm Gun'. The film also succeeds in letting the audience feel the sense of hope, happiness, and adventure that the main characters are clearly supposed to embody. The cast appear genuinely spirited and spontaneous. Also, the cameos by Joe Cocker and Bono are fun.In conclusion, this is definitely a must-see for people who appreciate deeply beautiful visuals and knockout choreography. Obviously, Beatles fans are likely to adore this film. Otherwise, go see 'Across the Universe' for a sweet, if hackneyed, love story about youthful characters living in a youthful time.",6,1,4,8 October 2007
Clash of the Titans," Big Silly Fun
","When one considers the epic sweep of Greek mythology it is clear that it was the closest the ancients could come to the effects-laden blockbusters that delight audiences today. In this spirit, 'Clash of the Titans' is exactly what it should be- a big, spectacular, effects-laden blockbuster with an undemanding plot and a good helping of eye candy. The story centers on a young man named Perseus, who steps up to save the city of Argos from the monstrous Kraken. In order to do this, he and a small band of soldiers have to face all sorts of perils so that he can get the only weapon that can defeat the aforementioned beast. His efforts are both helped and hindered by the gods themselves who cannot decide whether mankind should be taught love or fear.This film is a whole lot of fun. The plot moves at a good pace and the running time passes quickly. The monsters are imaginatively designed and skilfully brought to life by CGI. Also, the numerous battle scenes are exciting and well-filmed. Another nice touch is the inclusion of elements from Norse and Arabian mythology. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are obviously enjoying themselves as Zeus and Hades- the lords of Olympus and the Underworld respectively. Sam Worthington is decent as Perseus but he is really a bit dour, a little bit of humor would have gone a long way. However, overall it is very clear that nobody is supposed to take this film too seriously. This is a very successful update of the 1981 original and provides it's audience with a highly enjoyable night out.",6,1,2,12 April 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Rollicking, scary fun
","Director Sam Raimi undoubtedly reached the biggest audiences of his career to date through his work on the 'Spiderman' franchise. However, in the Eighties, his work on the 'Evil Dead' movies assured him a place in that elite Valhalla reserved for masters of horror. After years away from the genre, 'Drag me to Hell' is renewed proof that few filmmakers posses his ability both to terrify an audience and then have them in convulsions of laughter- while reminding them that nobody can outrun their conscience.The plot is pretty straightforward: Christine (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer who has been told that she needs to show toughness in order to secure a promotion that she covets. Hoping to win points with her boss, she refuses an elderly Gypsy's request that her mortgage be extended- causing this obviously ailing woman to lose her home. The old woman wreaks a horrific revenge by uttering a curse that unleashes the Lamia- an ancient demon that torments it's victim for three days before taking their soul to Hell for eternity. Christine is then subjected to increasingly terrifying manifestations of said entity (invisible to everyone but her)and enlists a medium to save her from damnation, but time is running out...The plot moves along at a cracking pace and there is no shortage of genuinely scary and shocking moments. However what really makes this film a joy is the mischievously surreal humor that permeates the whole enterprise, for example when a demonic eye appears in a slice of fruitcake. All in all, this is a terrific horror film that has no problem scaring it's audience while staying in touch with the idea that movies are all about having fun. Top-notch entertainment.",8,2,4,1 June 2009
Grindhouse," Fantastic tribute to a vanished genre
","Before home video, the only way to see low-budget exploitation films featuring graphic violence and lots of nudity was to go to a 'grindhouse'- a fleapit movie theater usually located in an inner city neighborhood and run by management who viewed unspeakably bad taste and an 'X' rating as badges of honor. These theaters got their nickname because they would sometimes offer burlesque performers as an added attraction. Anyway, this film is a lengthy homage both to the grindhouse experience in it's own right, and to the kind of movies that were shown there.'Grindhouse' takes the form of a double feature: Robert Rodriguez's zombie flick 'Planet Terror' and Quentin Tarantino's 'Death Proof'. The first feature is stronger by far, with loads of OTT set pieces, grotesque special effects, bucketloads of black humor, and intentionally wretched dialogue. The purposefully incoherent plot centers on the mayhem unleashed by a group of renegade soldiers who release a chemical agent that turns people into gruesomely disfigured (and, you guessed it- flesh eating)zombies. A small group of luridly characterized 'survivors' have to figure out what is going on and then fight their way to safety. Overall Rodriguez succeeds in replicating trashy, gonzo filmaking at it's absolute best.The second feature recounts what happens to two separate groups of young women when they run into a serial killer (Kurt Russell's 'Stuntman Mike')who uses his car as a murder weapon. The extended, climactic car chase is exhilarating but this installment is very badly paced. It feels like the first hour is nothing but a showcase for QTs admittedly otherworldly talent for constructing parlance. Yes, the interchanges between various characters are razor-sharp and compelling. Also, when the car chase explodes onto the screen it is much more thrilling due to the prolonged build-up. But in the end, there is far too much talk in this installment. Ironically, the quality of the verbal interplay also undermines the grindhouse motif since real movies of this sort had absolutely terrible scripts. Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile effort and oozes love for redneck gems such as 'White Lightning' and 'Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry'.In addition to the two main features, there are also several trailers for ersatz grindhouse fare such as 'Werewolf Women of the SS'. Two standouts here are the previews of 'Machete' (Mexploitation at it's worst)and 'Thanksgiving' (a Holiday slasher flick- directed by Eli Roth), both are so on-the-money that they are absolutely hilarious. Other subtle touches include the 1970s kaleidoscope pattern that fills the screen during intermissions, and ads featuring pictures of truly ghastly-looking 'Tex-Mex' food available 'next door to the theater'. Finally, the entire film has been treated so it looks like an aged and abused print is being projected onto the screen.The home video boom effectively killed off the real grindhouse theaters two decades ago, and the closest thing today to the exploitation flicks that were their lifeblood would probably be the more lurid offerings that are released directly onto DVD and late-night cable. Where 'Grindhouse' really triumphs is in recreating a lost experience for a whole new generation of moviegoers. Not only is this movie tasteless, rollicking fun, but it is also by turns both exhilarating and hilarious. A true postmodern masterpiece.",9,1,4,9 April 2007
The Departed," Dazzling character study from a master filmmaker
","Without a doubt this is the best film of 2006. The deceptively simple premise involves the Massachussets State Police planting an undercover operative (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the South Boston underworld in order to take down Irish mob kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). However, Costello has a mole of his own....What unfolds is an absolutely stunning examination of the nature of violence, loyalty, avarice, and betrayal. The ensemble cast are uniformly excellent though Martin Sheen and a caustic Mark Wahlberg absolutely steal the show in their supporting roles as DiCaprio's world-weary handlers. Big Bad Jack turns in a bone-chilling, high octane performance that simply lights up the screen. As a side-note, his character is based in part on the exploits of a real-life South Boston mobster, Whitey Bulger. The razor-sharp dialogue is enthralling and Martin Scorsese's direction is flawless. This film is a triumph.",10,2,4,9 October 2006
30 Days of Night," Moody, tense, grim vampire flick
","In recent years, vampire movies have transformed the undead into urbane clothes horses and pouting cannon fodder for roided-up alpha humans. Now, '30 Days of Night' takes vampires closer to their mythological roots than they have been in years. The bloodsuckers in this film are vicious, bestial, and ugly. Though humanoid in appearance, they truly seem monstrous. Their descent on the remote town of Barrow, Alaska has the sole aim of allowing them to feast on all the inhabitants as quickly and as brutally as possible. Barrow is so far north that in winter the sun does not rise for thirty straight days. As a result, a small group of (quite honestly, rather colorless) survivors led by Josh Hartnett have to evade and fight off the vampire horde for what seems like an eternal night.Director David Slade creates an atmosphere of tense foreboding, peppered with unanticipated shocks for the audience. The audience is drawn into a merciless, frozen world where the only thing that matters to either side is simple survival. Though the action scenes are expertly staged and plentiful, there are none of the completely OTT set-pieces (with souped up vehicles, guns firing holy water, ridiculous pyrotechnics, and obviously CGI effects) that have contaminated the horror genre in recent years.The vampires are allowed to be mysterious and menacing. We are not given any back story as to where they came from -though we see a derelict freighter in one of the opening shots, and they seem to speak some Slavic dialect. They are deliberately left as a terrifying enigma. Unfortunately, the human characters are really rather dull and it is difficult to care deeply for any of them.To wrap up, this is the best vampire movie in years. It lingers in the mind and offers ample quantities of gore, suspense, and thrills. There are a number of solid plot twists, and the script resists the temptation to offer any easy answers to the dilemma facing the ever-more overwhelmed townsfolk. By any standards this is a gruesome, chilling, Halloween treat for horror fans of all sorts.",7,3,6,22 October 2007
The Wrestler," Grimy comeback for a fallen idol.
","This film offers unflinching, bare-bones, answers to the puzzle of what happens when a person's fifteen minutes of fame are over. In this instance the person in question is 'Randy the Ram' (Mickey Rourke) a former wrestling powerhouse back in the Eighties who now ekes out a living on the VFW-hall circuit when he isn't unloading trucks at a grocery store. Randy lives in an America rarely seen on celluloid these days- a nation of trailer parks, strip malls, dollar stores, and grimy community halls.At first glance he appears scarily close to dereliction: his body is breaking down, he can't pay his rent, but when Randy is in the ring he once again becomes a star. However, it becomes clear that even his wrestling days are numbered and Randy -fearful of what the future holds- attempts to reach out to the daughter he abandoned many years earlier (a wonderful Evan Rachel Wood) and also start a relationship with a guarded exotic dancer who is also nearing the end of her shelf-life (the fantastic Marisa Tomei).At it's core, 'The Wrestler' is a depiction of how people try to cling on to hope, dignity, safety, and a sense of connection to others in a world that appears hell-bent on stripping all those things away. The characters portrayed by Rourke and Tomei could so easily be reduced the stereotypes, or even worse played for laughs. Instead both are allowed to be complex, vulnerable and very real human beings that the audience can't help but care for. All of the cast are outstanding but Rourke's performance is truly seismic in it's depth and honesty. His wrestler is a fundamentally gentle, flawed, principled man who is only too aware of his many failings and shortcomings and wishes only that others see the good in him.At times this can be a hard film to watch. The wrestling scenes skillfully arc between gratuitous brutality and dark humor. Director Darren Aronofsky allows the simple-yet-complicated story unfold at it's own pace. There are no simple answers. The pacing is low-key and the atmosphere is grimy. However the way in which the characters show compassion and allow themselves to falteringly care for one another gives this gem a big, beautiful, tear-stained heart.",8,0,0,23 February 2009
Trainspotting," Flawless adaptation of a groundbreaking book
","It is doubtful that there is much new that can be said at this stage about this adaptation of Irvine Welsh's triumphant 1993 novel of the same name. The film follows the misadventures of a group of extremely dysfunctional characters who are immersed in an underworld of addiction, crime, and violence. Their darkly funny antics are shortsighted, aimless, and nearly always have a tragic outcome. In this universe, the humane become casualties and only the most unprincipled have any chance of escape. Nearly all of the main protagonists are addicts of one sort or another, with heroin being the drug of choice. However, this film does not glorify drug use. The addict lifestyle and worldview is portrayed as being just as pointless and empty of meaning as the materialistic values and aspirations that are promoted by mainstream society.The richness of the material allows the audience to read 'Trainspotting' in many ways: as a scathing social commentary, a superb existential black comedy, a bleak human drama, a gritty portrayal of addiction in it's many forms, or as a meditation on the meaning of self and the nature of friendship in a brutal world. However one chooses to understand it, this film relentlessly challenges it's audience. It is by turns compelling, hilarious, and horrific. Danny Boyle's direction is truly outside-the-box in terms of his depiction of amoral characters in an amoral world. The dialogue is razor sharp and the acting is top notch. Special mention should also be given to the cinematography and set-design, and the soundtrack is flawless. This film is a classic.",9,5,6,19 November 2007
