Blade Runner 2049," Blade Stumbler
","Three points out of ten only for the cinematography, which equals expectations -- and is the only thing about this sequel that does. Maybe if it wasn't so over-hyped I would have been more tolerant of its weaknesses, which follow: there is an hour's worth of fat worthy of Terence Malick at his worst, meaning exposition for its own sake that never carries the story forward but serves as a backdrop for childish indulgence in visuals, that could easily have been cut; while the plot is tortuously convoluted and needed to be far more linear. The cast obviously reveres the material and is intimidated by the source, making for distance in their acting. James Edward Olmos, so sinister and subtly threatening in the original, has an unnecessary cameo as a doddering version of his younger self. And where is Vangelis, whose music added another dimension to the original? The music in this one is mediocre at best. I wonder if Ridley Scott was needed at the helm. Maybe my perspective is colored because I was there the first week the original Blade Runner came out and loved that great film, but if anybody who was there with me in the early 80's feels differently I'd love to know.",7,41,90,6 October 2017
The Ring," Thanksgiving in October
","The most annoying thing about this movie is the really silly use of plot devices.  No one really expects there to be anything new under the sun in horror or sci-fi and the intelligent film maker will devise STRONG twists on stuff that was perfected by Pabst/Browning/Whale/ Lewton/Hitchcock/Corman/Bava/Carpenter.  Don't be so weak in plot development and don't deceive or insult your more intelligent viewers because you can't decide if the boogie man will get you or a Holmesian conclusion based on logical insights will be reached.  Scare people because it makes sense, or scare them into suspending their disbelief because you know how to write.  Good acting though; and  at least I had an early early Thanksgiving of...celluloid turkey.",Null,0,1,22 October 2002
Inglourious Basterds," Amusing Homage
","Again the director hits us over the head with unabashed and sometimes silly references to what made him a film maker in the first place but, after all, what is his signature without that. I pity the soul who goes into this without knowing Quentin's work. Soon enough they will get it -- it's Christopher Waltz/Anton Diffring meets Lubitsch's To Be Or Not To Be meets Melanie Laurent/Catherine Deneuve meets Moe Howard/Adolf Hitler waiting for the closeup of Henry Fonda's eyes in.... ! It spins in all directions and ultimately becomes a grim absurd farce. However the whole thing grows on you after a bit and if you can overcome your annoyance with the broad brush strokes, you can enjoy the whole canvas.",6,2,12,4 October 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," Are we seeing the future?
","I strongly encourage everyone out there to view this brilliant film. Though episodic and with the usual Steinbeck plotting weakness, the courage it took Zanuck, Ford, and Johnson to make this statement is astounding considering it came from Hollywood 1940. It goes from grim to grimmer with an honesty that is almost unbearable. In an age when our shallowest vanities are catered to, from designer coffee to nail salons, the film is a seminal reminder of what was and looks like will be again. One note of humor I appreciated: the head of the immaculate 'social engineering camp' was made to resemble FDR. I can't but wonder -- is this the future as well as the past?",Null,0,0,15 February 2009
Van Helsing," Edward Van Sloan, I mean Abraham Van Helsing, is turning over.....
","...in his grave.  Of course they thought that the majority of moviegoers are not cinastes, and it doesn't matter if the memories of classic monster character development and subtleness is absent, but oh, a couple minutes of silence as Lugosi descends the staircase, or Lon Chaney Jr exposes his soul's anguish as the full moon rises, as Una O'Connor looks up at Karloff...are worth more and more memorable than this regurgitated second rate porridge could ever be.  HughJackman is a very good actor, and when he stars in a remake of Oklahoma I'm sure I'll love it -- but the old man with the horned rimmed glasses will always be MY Van Helsing.",Null,0,0,7 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," My Last Star Wars Film -- Ever
","Like another reviewer said, this is the last movie in the series I will see. I will not be disappointed again. I was there 40 years ago and have been to every one of them since within the first couple weeks of their releases. Though a notch above The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, this dreadful film is like a rag you soak up spilled coffee in and then squeeze into the sink. There is not an original idea in the entire wretched business and what's worse, whole parts of previous incarnations are blatantly stolen from to create this mess. Some of the ideas are slapped together and amateurish to boot. Only the casino scenes have visual merit but again they are derivative. The Yoda figure is almost inanimate and unforgivably boring. Worst of all are the appearances of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, who, rather than be presented with iconic build up and respect, are two geezers wheeled out of the home to get some sun. I wasn't sure if Leia was Carrie Fisher or Ethel Barrymore. Knowing Carrie is gone also made some of her scenes a bit creepy. She was much better served by the HBO documentary 'Bright Lights' as a swan song. And Hamill looked like the bum who asks for change with the cardboard sign by the highway. Remember when Luke Skywalker used to wash his hair? Finally Luke's absurd death reminded me of the scene in Wizard of Oz when the Wicked Witch melts away. Please.",2,2,3,29 December 2017
Signs," Mel Gibson Shines in Signs
","The film of course is excellent as a fusion of different elements and influences, primarily Val Lewton's concept of build up the fear but minimize the monster, and truly unique in that it's not a typical sci-fi zap-em-up or blood feast.  How refreshing not to see the cliched military perspective but emphasize the protagonist's psyche. There are some silly holes in the plot -- if I was within ten feet of a trapped alien I wouldn't stick around, would you? -- but overall it works, and for one reason: Mel Gibson.  This was, in my opinion, his best performance ever.  I rate them thus, in descending order: Signs, Mad Max, Hamlet, then Braveheart.  He is, like Connery, a movie star in the golden era sense of the word who only gets better with each new wrinkle.  The deep empathy and chemistry he has on screen with children(begun in Man Without a Face, developed in Patriot, and reaching its apex here), no doubt has its origins in his own large family, but it carries over from real life magnificently onto film.  May the Big Australian Three -- Gibson, Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush, keep astounding us!",Null,0,3,12 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Nursing Home
","Young folks out there: Once upon a time in Hollywood there was a superstar named Marlene Dietrich. She was born close to 1902 and died in 1992, having made her first confirmed film appearance in 1923 and her last in 1978. When she realized it was time to quit because of advancing years, she quit completely. From being one of the most photographed women in showbiz she went to never allowing another photo of her again, except once. She knew that by being photographed when no longer beautiful her legend would be diminished. I preface my opinion of The Force Awakens with that introduction because 38 years ago I remember the premiere of Star Wars; and how the cast appeared in it and the two sequels: young and attractive, with their images and personas sealed forever in epochal material: a combination and legend forever that only gained power with time. So now to provide a box office safety net, Disney drags out and dusts off the original trio of protagonists in Star Wars, problem being they're far from young anymore. In fact they are just plain old. Carrie Fisher has the wry, knowing look of a sagacious grandmother, as if she's letting the audience in on a joke -- that sexy thing she used to be is nowhere hinted at. Harrison Ford reminds me of Henry Fonda or John Wayne in westerns when they were collecting social security; and who'd ever think Mark Hamill in full beard under a Jedi hood would end up looking like Orson Welles? By appearing in this film they run the huge chance of diminishing their personas as at least 2 generations plus remember them. In terms of film immortality, this is a grave sin indeed. The film would have been better without them; memories of the past overwhelm here, and their appearance is sure to disappoint those who have followed the Star Wars saga since the beginning. Do we really want to be reminded how much we have aged, too?",2,20,29,20 December 2015
