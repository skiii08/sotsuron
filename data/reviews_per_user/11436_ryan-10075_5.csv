Gremlins," Fantastic Horror/Comedy
","First off I must say I really enjoy watching Joe Dante movies. In fact I can't think of another director I have more fun with watching his or her movies. This I think was his best film. I was lucky enough that at my local movie theatre they were showing free Christmas movies and this was one of the choices. I jumped at the chance and watched this one. Man, I tell you the sound and the music from Jerry Goldsmith were great listening to while watching this film for like the 50th time on the big screen (where it was meant to be shown).The basic gist of the story is well as I mentioned earlier its Christmas and inventor Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is out looking for a gift for his son Billy (played by Zach Galligan). He's going through Chinatown and comes across a store owned by Mr. Wing (Keye Luke). Inside he's got exactly what he's looking for; a cute furry, lovable pet named a Mogwai. Thing is Mr. Wing does not want to sell it. Rand works out a deal with his grandson (John Louie) and gets the pet. Thing is there are three rules that you need to follow: 1) Don't get him wet 2) He hates bright light, in fact it will kill him 3) Don't feed him after midnight. As a first time viewer with no understanding of the Mowgai you are shown exactly why each of these steps need to be followed. To make a long story short these rules are not followed and in the end the nice little town of Kingston Falls is being taken over by green, slimy monsters who to say the least are mischievous.Written by Chris Columbus, who went on to have quite a career directing HOME ALONE, MRS. DOUBTFIRE and a couple HARRY POTTER movies and produced by Steven Spielberg. Also starring Phoebe Cates, Dick Miller, Corey Feldman and Judge Reinhold. Howie Mandel did the voice for Gizmo and both Frank Welker and Michael Winslow used their voices for some of the gremlins.The music by Jerry Goldsmith is awesome and was one of my favourites when I was a kid back in the 80s. Its electronic and very 80s. I was whistling it coming out of the theatre.One of the reasons why I love watching Joe Dante movies is because of the hidden things that are in plain sight. For movie buffs I suppose you could say. Like looking for Robby the Robot, the time machine, Spielberg, Goldsmith, Chuck Jones, a Fangoria magazine to name just a few. Its great and Dante always seems to have a wonderful sense of humour in his films as well.On a side note this along with I would say INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM were the movies that helped push along the PG-13 rating. This was rated PG, but the violence and gore are way too intense for a simple PG rating. The one scene in particular (and yes, I love it) where Mrs. Peltzer (Frances Lee McCain) is battling gremlins in her kitchen using a knife, a blender and a microwave all with gory results.",9,2,3,9 December 2019
The Exorcist," 'What an excellent day for an exorcism.'
","This is to me one of the scariest films of all time. Before movies about the devil or demons was commonplace or before it may have become comical through imitations and parodies. It all may depend though on whether you believe in God or pure evil.It is the story of a twelve year old girl named Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) who becomes possessed and her mother Chris' (Ellen Burstyn) fight to get her well. After seeing multiple doctors who are unable to get her daughter better she meets with Father Karras (Jason Miller) who is a psychiatrist. He meets Regan and through his investigation gets Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) who has experience with exorcisms in driving the demon away.Personally, I think everyone puts in an A+ performance from Burstyn's excellent portrayal as Chris MacNeil to Linda Blair who in the roles I have seen her in never did a better job. I love how when her character is introduced she is in fact asleep. To Jason Miller who I thought hit it out of the ballpark in his role. Max von Sydow is great and memorable as the old-timer priest even though he was in his early 40s. Great what makeup and acting can do. Lee J. Cobb showed his incredible range playing a caring, smart cop and not a grimy villainous character that he generally played.Directed by William Friedkin who at one time really did make amazing films and was one of the best current (at the time) filmmakers around. He uses the same approach he used in THE FRENCH CONNECTION in trying to make it as realistic as possible even though to some the subject matter may be way out there. Written by William Peter Blatty who grabbed an Oscar and was based on his own novel. The film also has a terrific score which the title theme by Mike Oldfield, which is interesting because it was not written for the film. Rather Friedkin was looking for music and came across Oldfield's newly released record and thought the song would work for his film.I have seen this one in a movie theatre and loved it! Personally this is one of the greatest horror films ever made and to me a 9/10 rating doesn't quite do it justice, but there are a few things in the film that drop the rating a bit as it is not a perfect film. The one scene that perhaps many people love, but to me makes me laugh is the spider-walk when Regan comes down the stairs and blood is coming out of her mouth. I do not find it scary and to me it seems to be comical and sort of way out of left field.Anyways, I know after watching this I ain't gonna be buying my kid a Ouija board so that can talk to Captain Howdy! I could go on forever about how great this film is, but you should just watch it instead. Followed by a number of lesser sequels including EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC and it is incredible how bad that one is.",9,0,0,18 May 2020
The Fly," 'There was an old lady who swallowed a fly, perhaps she'll die.'
","I think David Cronenberg was in his highest form at the time that this film was released coming after VIDEODROME and THE DEAD ZONE. Jeff Goldblum (who is truly spectacular in this role and should have at least received an Oscar nomination) plays an awkward, but brilliant scientist named Seth Brundle. He has created telepods that will transport an object from one to the other. Geena Davis (who is great as well) plays journalist Veronica Quaife who is given the story by Brundle himself. In turn though, she starts to fall in love with the super-quirky scientist. One night though (after some drinking) Brundle jumps into a telepod to transport himself. An ordinary housefly though flies into the same telepod and that's when the fun starts.Plays out wonderfully as there is no introduction to character or set up of story, you are just thrown right into the mix meeting both Brundle and Ronnie (or Vernoica) at the same time. The only other main character is John Getz who plays Stathis Borans the editor of the magazine that Veronica is working for. Getz is quite good playing a self-centred sleazebag. Also has a nice strong score by Howard Shore that meshes great with the film.I think this really is a great film that works with very few main characters. It works on the acting, great story (writing credits go to Charles Edward Pogue and Cronenberg), Oscar winning effects (Chris Walas and Stephen Dupuis) and just wonderful direction from Cronenberg.Maybe not for all tastes. Remember this is a Cronenberg horror film, so there is some gore. But think of it as a tragic love story with strong elements of horror and science fiction. If that does sound interesting to you this will likely be a film to watch.",8,1,1,15 May 2019
Psycho," 'A boy's best friend is his mother.'
","I will do my best to relate to you a good review of this film, while not giving away all the juicy details that make this film one of the best films ever made. All I can say is wow and Alfred Hitchcock shows us why he is one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live with this low-budget 1960 shocker.The beautiful Janet Leigh (whose daughter happens to be Jamie Lee Curtis) plays Marion Crane who is dealing with a boyfriend (John Gavin) whose in need of cash and also the desire to marry this man. Crane is a real-estate secretary and a huge purchase is made in cash. Her job is to take the $40,000 to the bank on her way home. Thing is Marion decides to take the money and drive to her boyfriend in Fairvale. Before she gets there she decides to stop at the Bates Motel for the night. There she meets Norman Bates (amazingly played by Anthony Perkins) and this is where this truly great film gets even better.Janet Leigh garnered an Oscar nomination for her role which she richly deserved as I thought she does an amazing job really in caring the first half an hour of the film as we follow her and only her. The fact that Anthony Perkins did not even receive an Oscar nomination for his multi-layered in-depth portrayal of Norman Bates is beyond mind-blowing to me.The music as well by Bernard Hermann is truly one of the greatest not only in the history of horror, but of all-time films. It has been ripped off, attempted to be duplicated a number of times, but when you hear others be inspired by it you can tell exactly where the music is coming from.Screenplay by Joseph Stefano from a novel (which I have read and did enjoy) by Robert Bloch. Also starring Vera Miles as Marion's sister Lila, Martin Balsam as Arbogast, Simon Oakland as Dr. Richman and look fast for Ted Knight right near the end of the film.In my all-time list of greatest horror films this masterpiece stands only behind Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING in my mind. There is so much to look at and dissect and go over in your mind. Probably the most influential horror film of all time.Followed by three sequels (all of which were never equal to the original), a TV movie, a yucky shot-for-shot remake and a TV show.",10,1,1,19 May 2019
Jaws," 'You're gonna need a bigger boat.'
","This is not only one of the best films of the 1970s, but one of the best ever by legendary director Steven Spielberg.Not sure what I am going to say that likely has not been said countless times by other people on this site, but I will try. Right from the beginning of the film we are introduced to the setting and the shark through the use of John Williams' amazing, yet still simplistic score that has been copied or imitated numerous times when someone dips their toe into the water. We are also introduced to two young kids who are on the beach partying. They decide to go for a little swim. That is when we are really shown what this terrible monster in the water can do. Susan Backlinie really does an amazing job in this opening scene. It is from here that Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider in a fabulous role) is wanting to close the beach due to the death of the girl. Especially after Hooper (amazingly done by Richard Dreyfuss) an oceanographer states that it was a shark that killed her. Unfortunately, there is a great bit of resistance from the slimeball mayor (Murray Hamilton in a role that I will always remember him for). Until the deaths keep racking up. In steps Quint (wonderfully portrayed by Robert Shaw) a local shark hunter who offers his services for $10,000. So, the trio of Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw take Quint's boat to find and kill the shark.Now, the things that really makes this film work first off is the acting is beyond great. To me Scheider doesn't seem to really get enough credit due to the performances of both Dreyfuss and Shaw. All three of them were spectacular and really give the film more than enough fuel to make it to the final frame. My favourite scene in the whole picture is when the three of them are sitting around the table on Quint's boat after downing a few drinks. Both Dreyfuss and Shaw share stories about scars on their bodies until they come to the story about Quint during WWII being involved with a certain onslaught of sharks while he was in the water after his ship the USS Indianapolis was sunk. I find Quint's monologue scarier than anything else in the whole movie. Secondly as I mentioned earlier, the score is top notch and will forever be in your head. Thirdly, Steven Spielberg's ability to unweave the story on screen while not having you stare at a shark for half the movie wowing at it. No, he is setting up the scenes and driving home a fear that many of us would have if faced with the same life-altering challenges some of the characters face.Written for the screen by Carl Gottlieb (who has a role as Meadows in the film) and novelist Peter Benchley. I have read the novel and while it was okay and passable, in comparison to the film though it was teetering into a forgettable novel. Other than the shark that is. They took everything good from the novel and placed it into the film. They left a lot of the stuff I didn't really care for in the book completely out. Also starring Lorraine Gary who puts in a great performance as Brody's wife Ellen.If you haven't seen this movie, you have to watch it. A must-see for any fan of film in general. .",10,2,4,5 November 2019
