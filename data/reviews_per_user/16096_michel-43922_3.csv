The Equalizer," It's only a movie!
","The Equalizer is certainly not an original. Movies like The Matrix or Bourne Supremacy come up from time to time to make our head spin. The rest of the time, you get junk. The Equalizer is somewhere in between. Solely because Danzel Washington plays an interesting character very well. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The direction and photography makes it enjoyable to watch. It seems to me that many viewers are addicted to fast pace movies. If it's a bit slow starting, they tune off. I don't mind personally. Not every action movie has to be fast and furious. There are people, who like fast pace and others who enjoy some thinking time, or are simply waiting for a break in the action to go to the bathroom. Your wife or girlfriend won't likely appreciate the violence, but in this kind of action movies, you expect the baddies to act evil. I found The Equalizer enjoyable. Love the atmosphere and waited patiently to see the bad guys get wasted. It's always a satisfying feeling. Short of ever seeing that kind of outcome in the real world, we're bound to see many more of these movies, good and bad, in the future.",10,0,3,7 April 2017
Fury," War in a shell
","As war movies go, this one is not so bad. Lots of clichés of course. But I can't remember a war movie without any or all of those. That said, I don't remember seeing a WWII movie almost totally shot from inside a tank. I saw the cramped space. I imagine the stench of decayed bits of corpses in all the little places unreachable and «unbleachable». Little windows to see outside and the high probability of getting your upper body blown off if you have to open a hatch. And all this in a Sherman, a tin can compared to most of the heavy tanks the Nazis brought forth during the war. In battle, you're stuck in there, day after day, for months, if you are lucky, until you get finally blown off, just like the crews who were, minutes ago around you. I like this movie because it reminds us that men, ordinary men, fought and died in those things. Maybe some viewers have missed the point. As to the big fight scene at the end, well, I'll never get tired of seeing Nazis get mauled, even if it's just a fantasy. The bad guys have to fall.",6,1,2,5 November 2016
Arrival," Stellar intelligence
","Twelve alien space ships appears in 12 random places on Earth. They don't actually land. They hover like big rocks in the air. No signs of weapon and no manifest intentions. In fact, the Aliens are silent. It's not even clear if there is anybody on board or if they are only big drones learning about Earth and it's dominant species. Who are they? Where do they come from and why have they come? Those are the most important questions for humanity. But the most important question is how do we talk to them? How do we communicate with somebody out of this Earth. After all, we can hardly communicate truly with each other. Dr Louise Banks, played magnificently by Amy Adams goes straight for the basics. Before asking questions in a language we don't understand, we must first understand this language. She must use not only her skills at learning the words and their meanings, but her whole life experience consisting of a failure of communication with her husband and the love for her daughter who died of cancer while still young. We sometimes fail to understand that the insights we get from our life story are also important in moving on to the tasks we set for ourselves. While humans predictably panic and descend into conspiracy theories, she takes chances communicating with the Aliens, helped by her physicist companion. But communications with the octopus-like Aliens has to be done through a transparent wall. Words are exchanged through writings on pads and the Aliens throwing their own words on the wall. All across the world other humans are trying also to communicate with the Aliens. Soon, communications break out between nations and vital knowledge of what the others are doing is unavailable. The atmosphere renders well this breakdown in human communications. There is no dark side, just foggy gray inside and outside the ship. Dr Banks and her physicist friend play off each other for every scrap of understanding. Meanwhile the sound effects and the music are perfectly in synch with the action. In the end, it is physic and true communications that wins the day. A beautiful movie, one that plays to the heart and the intelligence of the audience.Very well done Mr Villeneuve.",10,1,10,13 November 2016
