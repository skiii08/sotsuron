Hereditary," The sad world we live in where this GREAT movie gets so much hate
","It is a sign of time when a movie like Hereditary get so much bad reviews. People are accustomed to the Marvell formula of bad jokes and worse CGI. If you like movies like The Omen, the Shining and the Exorcist, you will likely have a good time with this movie. If you think the Conjuring is a great horror movie this might not be your cup of tea.",10,2,4,25 August 2018
