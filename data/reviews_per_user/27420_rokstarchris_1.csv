The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Incredible
","This is one of, possibly even the best coming of age film ever. The way the hilarious quick witted Patrick to the beautiful Sam form a complex and emotional relationship with youngster Patrick. Everything about the film is brilliant the three lead roles are so complexly mixed together i have only seen the likes of such an emotional story in a Jeffrey Archer novel. From the way he interacts with his English teacher to incredible story of him and his friends once the credits roll on this film there will not be a pair of dry eyes in the house. 10/10 This is one of only three films that has made me cry including Red Dog when he lays down at his masters grave or Steve Carrell's speech in Dinner for Schmucks",10,0,1,5 August 2013
