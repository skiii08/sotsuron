Deepwater Horizon," One of the best movies I have seen in years
","This is one of the best movies I have seen in years. It is very well made with great actors, scenes, and graphics. It is definitely a movie worth watching more than once. Deep water Horizon depicts the true events that occurred during the horrific oil spill in the gulf back in 2010. Even if you did not know much of the events, this film is sure to educate you on those events that took place. There were some parts that seemed too predictable and you were able to continue guessing the plot/story line, but it was still an eye opening movie. The main character, Mike, is the chief electrician and he seems to be a leader on the Horizon. So, it only made sense that he would be one of the heroes that gets the other crew members to safety when the vessel blows. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Not only for entertainment, but for education as well. Everyone should see this movie to learn the true facts about what happened back in 2010 when the tragic oil spill occurred.",10,3,6,10 October 2016
