Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," If you don't like this movie, please die!
","So, this movie is the best I have seen the past year, and Sasha Baron Cohen should get an academy award for this, since he apparently played his role before, during and after the camera was rolling. The humor does mock some people yes, but if you have to be so politically correct that you can't enjoy this movie, you just haven't gotten the point. This movie is made in order to reveal other peoples prejudism, rather than creating them. This prejudism is show through various characters like a conservative rodeo cowboy, the general man on the NY subway, a party of Christian over class people, a group of feminists, etc. The most funny part is watching how all these people take themselves, and their causes so seriously (espessialy those feminists. So if you can't see the humor in this you are just TOO politically correct in your mind, and a double moralist, as everyone carries these prejudice thoughts shown in the movie. Borat has only driven them to the extreme.PS. YES there is a very anti semetistic scene in this movie, but anyone who has done their background research will know that Cohen is a Jew, who holds the sabbath holy, so this ONE scene, as well as the rest are probably VEEERY ironic",9,0,5,31 January 2007
