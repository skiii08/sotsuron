Requiem for a Dream," Awful
","*Requiem For A Dream*I rented Requiem for a Dream expecting good things.  There had been millions of great reviews about this movie and I thought I might give it a try. Sadly I was dissapointed.  I keep expecting the movie to go some place but it doesn't.  I could care less about the charactors, it's thier choice not to get a regular job and not do drugs.  The one good thing I can say about this movie is Ellen Burnstn did a fantastic job (sorry Julia, she deserved that Oscar).  As much as I like depressing movies, this was too much.  Just say No.*3/10*",1,6,12,29 April 2002
Minority Report," RUN!... To the theater, you can't miss this one!
","*Minority Report*I'll admit, I love most Speilberg films.  They can be pure entertainment at it's best, (Indiana Jones movies), and touching and brilliantly told stories that you just can't stop thinking about after you see them (Shindler's list).  Minority Report was a fully entertaining action that I can't stop thinking about!  My friends and I got to the theater a little late so we skipped on buying food.  One friend said she'll go buy popcorn when a scene gets a little dull (we did this a few times in AI).  Well, just to show you how entertaining this movie was she never bought that popcorn! 
Even though it's extremely entertaining it also has a great plot and visuals that are sure to win an Academy Award.  This movie should be recognized during Oscar season in all fields.The acting was great, and this is coming from someone who can't stand Tom Cruise.  The movie really only focuses on him.  He's in about 95% of the scenes.  He was fantastic.  It's hard to name my favorite scene but the end (not the final ending scenes in general, though they were great and had that Speilberg warmth) blew me away!  Just when you think you can predict what's going to happen it totally takes a big twist in a whole new direction.  This is a great movie, the best I've seen all year!  *10/10*",10,0,0,23 June 2002
Se7en," Great thriller!
","*Se7en*Last night I watched Se7en for the second time and threw it I picked up things I didn't pick up the first time.  It got better with second viewing! It follows the crime case of two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt)on the trail of a 'psycho killer' killing people by the seven deadly sins (hence the name).  All throughout the film there is mystery.  It puts you right there with the detectives, making you feel like you're trying to solve the crime too.The acting from Brad Pitt isn't great.  There's just a tone in his voice that sounds like he's trying too hard.  Morgan Freeman on the other hand was great, you just can't get enough of his voice.  Kevin Spacey was excellent. Gwyeneth Paltrow was good also.The end was the best part.  I want give it away for those who haven't seen it.  But theres about five minutes left in the movie and I kept thinking, how are they going to end it?  They did a fine job and I was quite impressed.*9/10*",Null,0,0,14 June 2002
Memento," The Best Film Of That Year
","*Memento*The Academy has gone crazy.  I am sure we all know that by now.  Last year they gave the covetted best picture award to Gladiator when we all know the best film was Almost Famous, wich didn't even get a nomination.  This year the same thing happened.  A beautiful Mind won best picture when we all know Memento should have because not only was it more original and entertaining, it was also very clever and well written (best original screenplay anyone?). But I guess I shouldn't care so much, after all we all know the Oscars nowadays only give the award to the movie that was most hyped.Memento deserves all the hype of A Beautiful Mind and more.  There wasn't a dull moment.  Guy Pearce gives an excellent performace (that the Academy overlooked) as a man without a memory.  The story goes backwards wich is incredibly clever and instantly draws you.  As you get farther and farther into the movie it starts to unfold and make sence and even before the end you realize this is a wonderful film!  And as for the surprise end, or beginning... well I suggest you see it to find out for yourself.*10/10*",Null,0,1,23 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Pearl Harbor meets... Star Wars
","*Star Wars:Episode II-Attack of the Clones*I told myself I wouldn't see this movie.  I was so dissapointed by the last one and didn't want it to make too much money.  Unfortunetly I have friends that think Hayden Christianson is 'super hot.'  I guess it wasn't unfortunate because I enjoyed the movie!  Well... I enjoyed most of it.  The first hour was terrible.  Hayden Christianson telling Natalie Portman she wasn't like sand (something like that)... was just awful.  The first hour contained more cheap dialouge than Pearl Harbor!  But for every stupid line Hayden fed Natalie there was a cool action sequence.  *spoilers*There were points in the movie where things start to change.  In  one scene Ewan McGreggor Says to Hayden 'You're going to be the death of me.'  This kind of sent chills down my spine considering Anakin caused the death of Obi Wan.  And than in a scene that turned me from giving this movie a 6 to giving it a fairly higher grade: Anakin talking about how he killed every creature in a village and the infamous Darth Vader music plays.  I knew that this was a turning point and it would be different from Phantom Menace. 
The acting is horrible.  But who sees a Star Wars movie for the acting anyways?  The dialouge at times is too much and brings the movie down.  But when Yoda pulls out that light sabor and 'uses the force', I smiled with great joy.  Unlike my reaction after seeing Phantom Menace (which was something along the lines of 'I'll never see another George Lucas film again') I am highly anticipating Episode III!*8.5/10*",2,0,1,17 May 2002
Forrest Gump," So many people think it's over-rated, I'm beggining to think it's under-rated
","*Forrest Gump*1994 was a decent year for movies.  Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption were good films.  So was Forrest Gump.  It's really starting to make me angry seeing people pan this movie so much!  It's not a bad movies! I have seen thousands of worse films.  And quite frankly this one was better than Shawshank, but not as good as Pulp Fiction.  But who can see the Academy giving the Oscar to Pulp Fiction, anyway?It's sad to know this movie can't be disscussed without talking about those other movies.  I believe people need to get over it!  What does the Academy know anyway?  They gave an Oscar to Opie! Moving on, this movie has great acting.  Tom Hanks is perfect for the role as a slow-witted southerner.  That didn't sound very nice...  I like Hanks, I think he's made some of the best films of the 90's!  But his Oscar was well-deserved.  Robin Wright does a great job as Jenny (or as Forrest might say 'Jen-nay').  And Gary Sinese was hilarious as Captian Dan. 
This movie has some of the most memorable characters in history!  Not to mention it's one of the most quoted movies (Life is like a box of chocolates, stupid is as stupid does, exc).  So, yes, it deserved winning best picture that year.  It was a great movie, probably on my top 100 of all time list!  *9.5/10*",10,1,2,23 May 2002
The Shining," Scariest movie ever.
","*The Shining*I wasn't alive in 1980 so I don't know or care what people thought about this movie when it first came out.  All I know is that the first time I saw this film it scared the heck out of me.  What's scarier is that it still scares the heck out of me.Everyone has a scene they found the most interesting or scariest.  To me, it was the twins in the hall. To many people it was just Danny riding around on his bike, REDRUM, 'Here's Johnny!', or the scary maze chase scene.  All those things scared me.  They still do.  The end was also scary.Jack Nicholson was fabulous, as expected.  The young boy who played Danny was great.  Is he still doing movies?  Shelly Duvall... er... let's not go there.  She just wasn't good.If you like horrors, this is the ultimate.*9/10*",Null,0,0,8 July 2002
American Beauty," Masterpiece of the 90's
","*American Beauty*The name says it all.  It is an American film about American people and it is beautiful.  The acting, script, directing, cienematography, exc. Everything about this film is near perfect.  The plot, in a way, is very basic.  I middle-aged man looking for a change in life.  But the movie is bruttally honest.  Kevin Spacey plays Lester who has pretty much fallen out of love with his wife Carolyn (Annette Benning).  Thier daughter Jane(Thora Birch) thinks they are absolutely crazy and doesn't want to have anything to do with them. But at least her dad isn't complex and cruel as her nieghbour/boyfriend Ricky's dad, Frank.  Lester has something of a crush on Jane's friend, Angela.  He imagines her covered with roses, which when you think about it is very strange-but very unique and beautiful.  There is a lot more happening in the plot but I don't want to give it away.Kevin Spacey gives an amazing performance, as does the rest of the cast.  In my opinion this movie deserved every award it was nominated for.  It is a triumph on all levels.*10/10*",10,0,0,11 May 2002
Spider-Man," Great actioner!
","*Spider Man*I went in to Spider-Man expecting the same old fight sequence after fight sequence and no substance.  Fortunately this was not the case!  Spider-man was a great movie with wonderful action and special effects!  I mean, c'mon, Spiderman swinging on the walls coming up inches from the ground?  That was pretty breathtaking stuff!  Tobey McGuire played the part of Peter Parker/Spider-man very well. Everyone, including me, had thier doubts about nerdy little Tobey playing big buff super hero Spider-man.  But Tobey proved that he is not only a great actor, but can also be an action star!  Kirsten Dunst also did suprisingly well, considering her last few movies were teen flicks.  And William Defoe was exceptional as The Green Goblin.  The only problem I had with him, and everyone is talking about this, was his costume.  He's scarier with out it!  I am very happy this wonderful movie shattered the box office records and is on the imdb top 250!  It really deserves it because it is a great movie from start to end!*9/10*",10,0,0,5 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," One of the most boring movies ever
","*Pearl Harbor**slight spoilers*This movie, by far, is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  Big stars can't save it.  How on earth can people like this movie? 
The character development is horrible.  Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale)is a nurse who falls for Rafe (Ben Affleck), a pilot.  Rafe's best friend Danny(Josh Hartnett), is also a pilot.  After Rafe goes off and 'dies' Danny and Evelyn are heartbroken.  But what the heck, about two weeks later Danny has Evelyn knocked up and he thinks he's in love.  This sounds like it might not take that long but it's stretched out with plenty of bad dialogue and corny jokes.  Than Rafe returns (his plane crashed into the ocean, he survives), he isn't very happy and decides he doesn't like Danny anymore, but loves Evelyn.  Lots more boring dialogue and than 30 minutes of a great battle scene take place (this is all they showed us in the teasers, false advertising at it's worst).  We had to wait through about 2 hours of Evelyn loves me, Evelyn loves me not to get to JUST 30 minutes!  Than we wait through more corny dialogue, 'I'm giving my heart to Danny, but I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you', and than we get a bit more action scenes.  Not enough.Don't get me started on the acting.  It's just plain bad.  There are so many familiar faces in the movie... but the acting is still bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.  Go rent From Here To Eternity, it's great in every way that Pearl Harbor isn't.*2/10* (it gets an extra point for the attack scene)",Null,0,1,14 June 2002
Gone with the Wind," The Most Magnificent Film Ever Made
","*Gone With The Wind*When Gone With The Wind was released, back in 1939, it wasn't just another movie.  Gone With The Wind was a spectacle.  Audiances flocked to see it, and six decades later it is still one of the highest grossing films of all time.GWTW seems to find love in every genertion.  I saw it when I was 12 and it instantly became my favorite film.It is an amazing movie experience.  It is a movie that could never be remade.  Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are almost too perfect for thier charactors.  This film is almost too good to be true.*10/10*",10,0,0,27 March 2002
Seabiscuit," Good, feels like an older classic
","*Seabiscuit*Walking into Seabiscuit I wasn't sure what to expect.  Walking out I was pleasantly happy with the movie.  It had it's moments in the beggining, but spectacular performances from th leads really bring this movie out. 
It would be hard to hate a movie like Seabiscuit anyway.  It's inspirational and America loves the underdog.  And every character in this movie is an underdog.  The makers want you to feel sorry for the leads and they do a good job at it.  I think the real winner in Seabiscuit is Tobey Maguire.  Everyone KNOWS he is Spider-man, but he is also something more.  I really hope that his career doesn't typsecast him as Spider-man for the rest of his life like Leonardo Dicaprio is always associated with Titanic.  Because like Dicaprio, Tobey was having a smooth career with criticly aclaimed independent films and then came the big blockbuster and that's all they get credit for.  Dicaprio has been wonderful in a few other big movies but we still associate him with Titanic.  Hopefuly Tobey will rise above that.  I really think he can with this movie.  His performance is strong and touching and pretty much Oscar-worthy.  Even if he doesn't win, he deserves a nomination.  Speaking of Oscar Chris Cooper gives a nice performance.  He didn't really breakout in this movie, neither did Jeff Bridges, but thier performances were nice.Though it is a little overlong, it is mighty.*8.5/10*",Null,0,0,28 July 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Well, I thought it was fantastic!
","*Moulin Rouge*Moulin Rouge has become the ultimate love-it of hate-it movie.  Most men hate it, and a lot of females hate it too.  But me? Being the heterosexual women I am, loved it.  The love story didn't bore me like most people complain it did.  The music was sensational!  Unlike most people, I liked the mix of popular music from back in the day.  My favorite music moment had to be 'Roxanne.'The one thing that doesn't make me completely love Moulin Rouge is the first 20 minutes.  It was awful.  I was ready to turn it off or leave the room.  I don't remember the exact moment I started to like it, but after a while it just grew on me.  The charactors were well thought up and the setting had me in a trance.  And of course, the music saves it.*9/10*",10,1,2,1 May 2002
Once Upon a Time in America," An amazing score helps this decent movie
","*Once Upon a Time in America*I have seen the 3 hour version (or whatever version AMC plays ever so often) many times.  It's not that it's a great movie, it's just that whenever it's on I feel I have to watch it.  And maybe I'll pick up on something I didn't understand the first time I saw it.  Because there are some things that just don't come together.It starts of slow, with Robert De Niro revisiting his childhood home in New York.  I suppose he hasn't seen it in a while, and everything has changed. But instantly you are taken with the score.  I believe the score of the film to be one of the best in history.  I was really taken with it.  The scenes when Robert De Niro and his pals are kids is perfect.  I would give those scenes alone a 10.  When we first see him spying on (the very young) Jennifer Connelly while she is dancing (and that beautiful score plays), the second time I saw this movie it made my eyes tear up.  Just out of pure brilliance and knowledge of what was going to happen in the future with the young kids. But when the cast gets older the movie starts to fall apart.  It still has that heartbreaking score that pulls at your strings, but sometimes things happened so fast you got lost.  And the only way you can tell if it's a flashback or not is by the color of Robert De Niro's hair.  But sometimes he wears a hat and you get incredibly confused.  I did however enjoy how New York was seen throughout the years in the movie.The kid who plays young Robert De Niro has a mole so fake, it's obvious. Besides that he does good.  As does the real De Niro.  Jennifer Connelly could have used an acting lesson and out of the whole cast who would have known she would be the next to win an Oscar?  Besides Jo Pesci, who was in it for about one minute and he didn't even stand up.  But he got billing far before Connelly who had a bigger part and was in it for a bit longer.  And kudos to the casting agent on whoever cast the older version of Connelly, it took me a while to realize it wasn't the real Connelly. 
No kudos to the makeup artist.  The kid with the fake mole and the fact that older Jennifer Connelly didn't have one wrinkle on her face when she was about 60 is just insane.This was not quite a masterpiece... but so very close.  I still can't believe it didn't win an Oscar for best score!*8.5/10*",Null,0,2,25 July 2002
Titanic," Stop complaining and admit you love it
","*Titanic*Ugh.  The hypocrites that infest our world.  People that shelled out money to see Titanic multiple times in the theaters now say they hate it to death. That's just sad.  Sad and pathetic.  It just annoys me to death when people say 'oh what a waste of Oscars.'  Whatever.  You know you rooted for Titanic.  It's just that now it is 'uncool' to like Titanic.  So people deny they like it and go with what everyone else says.  So typical. 
I love Titanic.  The first time I saw it I was taken away.  After is was over all my friends (who now claim it stunk) praised it.  What a shame.The performances were okay.  I thought Leonardo was wonderful in all his other films.  Same with Kate Winslet.  Leonardo is another thing that is now 'uncool' to like.  Well I like Leo.  He's a good actor and he's due for a comeback (Scorsese and Spielberg, the names speak for themselves). 
So unlike everyone else who posts on here claiming they have always hated Titanic and deep down they all know they love it, I will admit that I love it.  *8/10*",Null,3,6,1 June 2002
A Beautiful Mind," How on Earth?
","*A Beautiful Mind*This film is the most over rated film of 2001.  I don't know how on earth it won best picture, director, and nomination for best actor.  I just can't believe it.I saw the real John Nash on Larry King the other day and let me tell you his accent is nothing like the thing Russelle Crowe tried to do.  What kind of accent was Crowe using anyways?  Sure Jennifer Connelly did great but she wasn't supporting, she was lead actress!  That just shows the members of the academy didn't really see this movie they just gave into the hype and voted on it.I love movies of all genres.  I loved Forest Gump.  I should love a movie like this, but I don't.  As far as I saw it was just hype.  There is nothing special bout this movie.  It's just a film with  big name actor backed up by hype galore.  I still can't believe it won so many awards...*4/10*",1,4,9,2 April 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Amazing... that this won so many awards
","*A Beautiful Mind*I saw a Beautiful Mind a few months ago and disliked it very much.  There are some movies that can be long and have a reason to be (ie. The Godfather), but this movie could have been an hour shorter.  I heard reviews saying it would 'change the way you look at the world.'  That is insane!  I saw this movie and forgot about it until it started to sweep the Academy Awards.Russell Crowe gives a terrible unbelievable performance!  I have always thought Crowe was a good actor but the fact he was a shoe-in for best actor...  It's obvious the Academy cares more about the production than the performances.  Jennifer Connelly won best supporting actress.  It's a shame because she wasn't a SUPPORTING actress, she was lead.  And as for her performance, it was so-so.  Nothing special to it.Besides not deserving best picture and best supporting actress it also did NOT deserve best director.  Ron Howard should have given his nomination to Baz Luhrman.  Ridley Scott did a fantastic job recreating a war.  Baz Luhrman imagined Moulin Rouge.  Peter Finch took us on an trip I can't explain to you.  I think every director nominated for 2001 desereved more than Ron Howard, who simply gave us a boring movie with a big name star.In the end A Beautiful Mind will go down as a weak pick for best picture (A beautiful mind over Memento... please).*2/10*",1,4,10,19 April 2002
Signs," Creative and Suspenseful
","*Signs*I've read so many negative reviews on imdb about saying how this movie was 'slow'.  Do these people have the attention span of a 4-year old?  In my humble opinion it had reasons for its slow parts.  Another great director did this, and it always worked.  Hitchcock.  And I'm not comparing M. Night Shyamalan  to Hitchcock, because nobody comes close to Hitchcock.  But if any director of today, Shyamalan is our closest thing to Hitchcock.  Signs had a little Hitchcock with a bit of Orson Welles.  Just my opinion though.And it just makes me so mad that people would bash a great movie that is coming out in our day in age when we have such crap.  I mean, Master of Disguise came out last week, maybe if you thought Signs was too slow you'll be able to keep up with that.But for the rest of us, go see Signs.  It's fabulous.  And a great ending.*8/10*",Null,0,1,8 August 2002
Heat," Really Good
","*Heat*Over the years I've been told I had a weird taste in movies.  Unlike most girls my age I would rather watch a Robert De Niro movie over a Freddie Prinze Jr. one.  But if I had a top 100 movies list Titanic would probably be by Heat.  So I guess you could say I have bi-sexual movie taste.  Anyway I enjoyed Heat very much.  Al Pacino plays the cop, Robert De Niro plays the bad guy.  Just having those two leads it's obvious this will be no ordinary movie.  Their first meeting is in a coffee shop.  The scene is incredibly well done.  I kept thinking 'Micheal, your father loves you very much,' but they were playing completely different characters from The Godfather II.Many people complain about the length of Heat but it didn't bother me.  It allowed you to get to know the character's lives outside of their jobs.  De Niro and Pacino give great performances and so do it's supporting cast. Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, and even Natalie Portman has a few scenes.  This is a great movie and I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the genre.*9.5/10*",10,0,0,7 June 2002
Gangs of New York," Phenomenal, Intense, and Epic
","*Gangs of New York*I doubt I have ever seen a movie of this caliber in the theaters.  That might have meant something a little more if the Roger Ebert had said it, granted I am only 15.  But for three short hours (not being sarcastic there, the time did go by quickly) I lived in New York 1863.  A rarity in most films today is that they can take you in heart and mind to where the story is taking place.  But this one did.  It wasn't glamorous New York like we might see in most New York based movies coming out now that just scream 'I LOVE NEW YORK!'  No, this was the dirty, grungey New York of nightmares. Life isn't all good even if you have money, everyone is against you, out to get your money so that one day they might be in the same position as the rich.  The setting is incredible, damn George Lucas for suggesting Martin Scorsese use a computer generated set instead of building one.  It's so massive, and you can see the fine detailing and all the hard work.  Every scene is picture perfect.And then there were the characters.  Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) will go down in history as one of film's most memorable characters.  He was hated and loved sometimes at the same time.  Amsterdam Vallon, the unusual hero of some sort, was also a very interesting character.  Does he like the man that murdered his father before his eyes?  Cameron Diaz's character, Jenny nurses his wounds and kisses his scars.  Does Vallon care so much about her?  Either way, they have great chemistry, and not that phony Hollywood kind either.The acting was beyond words for one reason, one man.  Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher.  Incredible performance.  If this man does not win the best actor Oscar, it's just proof the Academy is once again, corrupt. Day-Lewis was once considered one of Hollywood's sexiest, if definitely not in this movie.  He is dirty, greasy, and low.  And incredibly in character. Congrats, Day-Lewis, you have just won yourself another Oscar.  Another great performance was of course, our dear beloved Leonardo Dicaprio.  For years he was considered a lover boy and nothing else (it makes me mad to this day.  In Titanic, yes he was a lover boy, get over it) but this year he broke out of that box that we made for him.  He played two COMPLETELY different characters in Catch Me If You Can and Gangs of New York, but he played them both flawlessly and deserves a nomination for one of the movies. Cameron Diaz was wonderful, not so Oscar Worthy, but good for what she was. And if she is nominated, please let it be in the best supporting actress category 2002 was a great year for supporting casts, but this one takes the cake.  Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, and Liam Neeson just to name a few. 
And if the Academy doesn't award Mr. Scorsese an Oscar for best director, you'll be seeing my angry posts on this board again.*10/10*",10,0,0,3 January 2003
Gladiator," It was okay
","*Gladiator*In 2000 Gladiator proved that hype and money will win you a best picture. Gladiator was the LAST movie nominated that year that deserved best picture. If anything it was a harmless summer blockbuster that got too much hype.I thought Russell Crowe was good in this movie, but not better than Tom Hanks.  Crowe was better the year before in The Insider, but not as good as Kevin Spacey.  The best performance HANDS DOWN was Joaquin Phoenix.  I think Joaquin is a great and under-used actor.  Just look at To Die For.  Totally different roles, it's almost hard to believe they're the same person.  If anyone deserved an Oscar that year, it wasn't Crowe, it wasn't Benicio Del Toro, it was Joaquin Phoenix.  Del Toro should feel ashamed for accepting an Oscar he didn't deserve.I liked the directing in this movie, the end was well done.  But all the fluff between the fights were boring.  Overall it was an okay movie, with plenty of hits and misses.*5/10*",Null,0,1,11 June 2002
