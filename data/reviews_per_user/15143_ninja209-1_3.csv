The Incredible Hulk," hulk smash!!!
","I found this movie at blockbuster one day just thought id check it out. i didn't know what i was to expect in this movie. i've seen it at least 3 times now and i just got one word to describe this film, INCREDIBLE.it was right up there with iron man in my opinion. I loved this movie from the acting to the story to the action etc. It was pretty epic. Finally they have made the hulk the way it was supposed to be made. It just got right to the point unlike the previous hulk film by Ang Lee. It was just so boring but this one gets right to it. It starts out with Bruce Banner, he has been in hiding somewhere in Brazil for a good 6 months still trying to find a cure to get rid of the monster within him. It seems to be going pretty well until the military somehow found out where he has been hiding and hunted him down and it pretty much goes from there i guess. He makes his way back to the states, meets his old girlfriend, and so on. The scenes where he becomes the hulk are really worth it especially the final fight between him and abomination. There was a few things they took from the old TV show as well. 'The lonely man' song was even put in there and i wasn't expecting that lol and other things. I really hope they consider making a sequel",8,2,3,27 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," great movie
",I walked into the theater didn't expecting much of this film clearly i was wrong. This was one of the best movies i've seen this year. I mean come on it's james bond. WITH A VENGEANCE. The movie just picks up 5 mins after Casino Royale ended and it really opens with a bang. I mean it literally just goes right into the action. There's not much story in this one. In fact i kinda was confused on what it was. But from what i understand Bond was out seekeng revenge on whoever killed his girlfriend Vesper Lynd the main lady from the previous film. And something about bolivias water supply or something but anyway this was one of the more action packed bond flicks. Classic bond fans might be a bit disappointed because most of the bond charm and clich√©s were taken out but action fans and bond fans alike should still definitely check this movie out. And with the running time of 1 hr and 45 min this is the shortest bond movie to date. But you guys should still give this one a shot. it gets a 8 out of 10 in my book ps olga kurylenko is HOTT ;),8,1,2,29 November 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers 2 review
",Once again I found myself going into another movie not knowing what to expect. I never really did care much about transformers in general but after seeing the first movie i thought to myself wow so that was transformers huh not bad. so when the news came about announcing the 2nd movie i just thought what more could they do? answer more action more explosions more Megan fox and another story i didn't care much about the film's highlights obviously were the extended over the top action scenes. watching those robots really duke it out on the big screen really makes you feel like you're right in the action and man are there a handful of those scenes. At first I just thought wow this movie basically was just one action scene after another. The story however is just straightforward and linear to say the least. Now I'm not gonna spoil anything I mean this is just a review if you wanna know the story read the summary or go watch the movie. overall it's just another summer blockbuster with pure entertainmentPROS --kickass action scenes --great effectsCONS --straightforward linear storyline --sub-par acting,7,5,12,24 June 2009
