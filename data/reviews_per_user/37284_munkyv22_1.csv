Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Even a blind squirrel occasionally finds an acorn. Sometimes 3 in a row...
","OK, would the REAL George Lucas please stand up? Man, what a horrible film to go and ruin the Star Wars series. It's even worse than The Godfather part III. Jar Jar was an annoying character, Anakin was whiney and the story was poorly developed. I sure hope attack of the clones is better. If not Star Wars for many of us may have to remain... forever a trilogy.",Null,1,2,3 May 2002
