The Expendables 2," Excellent movie that had potential to be much better but it didn't happen
","Just got to see Expendables 2 on its first day here and dang i'm happy to say i liked it a lot and so seemed everyone else.This move is completely different than anything that came out in the recent years cause the laughs and smiles and the great feeling it gave. And then after analyzing it over this night i must say its far from perfect, Camera work is OK but feels so much that they rush through some scenes in the beginning and the action is generally a bit fuzzy and hard to concentrate on whats going. Maybe it would help if the movie was longer but who knows. Action feels to have a good grip on realism as guns run out of ammo and not every vehicle explodes when shot like they would have a 'michael bay syndrome'.The cast of legends do a great job acting...hmm...themselves...with the right amount of humor and one liners. Overall feel is they are there to have fun and do a good relaxed acting and to transfer that fun to the theater, witch they accomplish with great success.'Manual' and computer generated effects are really excellent with an old school vibe and fit this move really well but sometimes like in the beginning they can get a bit silly (like the bridge explosion) and sometimes they fall a bit flat.Like some 1980's action films this feels to capture the magical 'IT' that made the first one so great and will leave you with a huge smile :) despite some scenes being way too short and rushed leaving people to want to see more.",9,0,7,17 August 2012
