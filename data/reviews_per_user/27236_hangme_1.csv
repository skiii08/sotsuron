The Blair Witch Project," So wrong in so many ways
","The Blair Witch Project...The filming and the cuts of the film was fine for what it was suppose to represent - a documentary.  It was meant to look raw.The acting was dandy because they seemed like 'real' people rather than actors.Hey it was even suspenseful, if not scary. To run in the dark and try to get the thing(s) making the noise on film wasn't the brightest thing to do but still believable.Now what is wrong with it...I.  Logic  1)  Follow the stream to civilization.  Learn and remember the map before going out to the forest.  Take a guide with you?    2)  Why sleep in a tent with it closed when you know something is possibly after you?  I'd think I'd stay awake.  3)  Why sleep in the dark?  Bonfire anyone?  4)  How many battery packs for the cameras did they have anyways?II.  Hardly original  1)  Read other's comments about the originality of the mock-documentary.  2)  Not scary.  Suspenseful and psychological - yes.  3)  Dumb ending.  I understood it as the story is told in the beginnings of the film.  I would have preferred the camera being dropped as they ran away from the 'unknown' to state the 'unknown' was so frightening that they even decided to give up the filming.  They had continued to film when they were lost in the woods and even when they heard noises but actually knowing was too much.  Survival became the ultimate need.Highly disappointing as it had so much potential but it was just like any other Hollywood movie.  Bad plot holes and poor logic.",Null,0,1,1 August 1999
