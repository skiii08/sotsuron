Black Swan," What did I just watch?
","I can't believe I just spent 2 hours in front of a theater screen watching this movie. I feel so bad, because over the weekend we went to see The Nutcracker play, and because The Nutcracker has ballet as it's basis for communicating a story (wonderful and happy I might add) the Black Swan appeared to put a damper on my ballet experience for 2010.This is just not quality entertainment. It felt irresponsible to our culture to be released over the holiday season.If you can accept or enjoy sexually distasteful and unexpected bizarre plot scenes, then maybe you will be okay with this movie. It did keep my attention even though I had to look away several times. But it put a stain on my holiday psyche that I will do my best to remove.I want to say something good about this movie so I can sound unbiased, but really, it was a waste of my time and I am sorry I entered the theater.Hollywood needs to change it's way.",1,25,81,2 January 2011
