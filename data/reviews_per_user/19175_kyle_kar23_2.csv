Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch is an Instant Classic...
","Where do I begin? In many ways, this movie is absolutely perfect as far as what movie's are meant. I was completely engaged and on the edge of my seat the whole time. I saw this last night in IMAX in San Francisco, and it blew my mind from start to finish. The whole auditorium was packed with hundreds of people, and there wasn't one noise that came from the audience the entire time. And at the end, everyone went into a frenzy shouting, clapping, half the crowd gave a standing ovation. In all honesty, this is the best movie I have ever seen in terms of pure entertainment. Every time a new song would start (and the soundtrack is amazing by the way), I would get chills up my spine because you know you're about to enter a world that's only seen in your dreams. And that's what you get. When Babydoll enters her fantasies- the colors, the sets, the cinematography, the backgrounds, the actors, the sounds, EVERYTHING is so beautifully intensified x100 that you can't help but just let go of your mind and let the breathtaking visuals take over. '300' was great, could have had more action. 'Watchmen' was good, a little slow at times but still good. 'Legend of the Guardians' was great. But THIS, THIS is a whole new beast of a film. It is Zack Snyder at his absolute best. It races at an unbelievable speed and ferocity that you gotta hold on tight. I'm 100% sure there won't be a better film than this for a long time. Zack Snyder just raised the bar in filmmaking..... REALLY HIGH.My Score: 15/10",10,4,9,28 March 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," ***Best Movie of 2010 So Far***
","WOW...where do I begin? I was extremely lucky to attend the premiere of Resident Evil: Afterlife in Tokyo, Japan, and let me just say, it was nothing short of amazing. Before the premiere, Avatar (NOT that Airbender crap)has been my all-time favorite movie. But now that has changed, mainly for the fact that there is literally NON-STOP ACTION in Resident Evil: Afterlife. This was the most entertaining movie I've ever experienced. It grabs onto you and doesn't let you go, which is very rare for movies to do these days. I wasn't a big fan of any of the previous Resident Evil installments, but I feel Afterlife is almost Oscar-worthy simply for the fact that the director knows how to make great action sequences with fantastic special effects. Not to mention that the 3D was phenomenal, and really made you feel like you were in the movie's world. I don't want to give anything away, but I must warn that there are some VERY scary,gory, and disturbing scenes in Afterlife. I can't believe that it's only given an R rating. In my honest opinion, this film is slightly a higher level of maturity than R. Nevertheless, this is the best movie you're going to see in a long, long time. If you're in the mood to get sucked into the most intense and violent movie yet in cinema to date, Resident Evil: Afterlife is for you. A flawless 10/10",10,28,60,9 September 2010
