Raiders of the Lost Ark," Harrison Ford in another adventure hit
","Ah, the Raiders of the Lost Ark. What a film. The first of the Indiana Jones trilogy, and in my mind the weakest. As with Return of the Jedi, though, being the weakest in a trilogy of genre defining films is nothing to complain about it.Now where can I find a hat and a whip...",8,0,2,9 June 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Aarrrr Jim Lad
","Johnny Depp, I'm male and I love you. Yes, this is how great he is as Captain Jack Sparrow in this Disney adaptation of a Disneyland ride.The first time I saw this film was on a bootleg copy in Thailand so it wasn't the best experience, what with missing half the words to fuzziness and general rubbishy quality. What I saw though made me realise that this was one film I couldn't miss.When I got back to Bangkok (still in Thailand) I went to a Thai cinema to go see it which was great because the seats were leather recliners and you got food delivered to you! My sister and I settled down and prepared ourselves for the next 140 minutes of swashbuckling fun.In my eyes this is Johnny's film. Without it Pirates of the Carribean is just another Summer moneymaker, with him it becomes a classic. Everything about his character is pure entertainment, from his funky looks to his drunken stagger.Speaking about his funky looks, I'm so getting dreadlocks when I'm older. I reckon with a dab of eyeliner, a bandana and a pirate's hat I'll be quite close to Jack Sparrow.Anyway, I'm talking rubbish now so just go see this great film.",10,0,1,25 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Ewoks!
","Being the worst of the best Science Fiction trilogy isn't anything to complain about, and this is exactly what the Return of the Jedi is. Though it may have Ewoks (yub, yub!) that doesn't halt it from being an absolute classic. George Lucas at his absolute best.",9,0,1,9 June 2003
Apocalypse Now," Intelligent masterpiece
","Francis Ford Coppola's defining hour (or three). Everything you've ever heard about it is true and more. An informative, dark yet sometimes humourous look at the conflict in Vietnam. Warning: Don't watch this if you're beneath the age rating. This film will be above you in both maturity and content.",9,0,1,9 June 2003
Blade Runner," Gritty classic
","Famed for its fantastic portrayal of a future that wasn't clean, shiny, and full of helpful robots. Blade Runner really gave a kick to the cinema industry with its dark urban setting, harsh flourescent lighting contrasting starkly with the dingy surroundings that Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) finds himself in. Music that chills, acting that thrills, and an unforgettable opening shot.",9,0,1,9 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Nothing but love.
","Star Wars. Wow, well, there's not that much I can say really. It was the first film I can remember seeing and truly loving. I must have been about 6. Since then I must have spent over Â£2000 on memorabilia related to these classics and even though i'm older now and more economical with my money I still love these films every bit as much as when I first saw them.
Star Wars: A New Hope is of course the opening chapter where we are introduced to many of the characters. The sheer presence of them is fantastic. You'll never beat this.",10,0,0,9 June 2003
