Walk the Line," Best Film Ever!
","Man i cud not live with out this film it truly is a masterpiece. It had my feet tapping the whole way through and now i have it on 2disc DVD (woo ye!) so i am really happy now! My favorite film of all time. I f u do not like Walk the Line then u can suck a monkeys cock and tell him i told u to. (if monkeys have cocks). Any way the film is gr8, special features are great, all over it is gr8. I have 5 posters of the film so u can call me a fan. Have fun reading this and if u haven't seen Walk th3e Line then go 2 your nearest video store and rent it out or even better........... BUY IT!!!!!!! That was my review of Walk the Line, like it or leave it. Bye!",10,0,2,29 May 2006
