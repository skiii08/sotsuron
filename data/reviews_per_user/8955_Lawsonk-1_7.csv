The King's Speech," Great Teamwork Makes for a Contented Life--Find It Here, IMHO
","Hooper, what a director!! What motivates the motivator? The anguish Firth transmits is so palpable, I experienced a new level of empathy. Hooper has a wonderful sensitivity towards women, respectful of all that they contribute to our lives, what can't HB Carter do? She is so much more that just the eyes, it's every pore, every fiber. I fancy you and Jennifer are best friends?Geoffrey Rush IS everyones best friend, helpful and honest, no matter the cost, always a friend and his strength comes from the quiet soulmate Jennifer Ehle portrays with quality rather than quantity! The compliment to actors is that we can't imagine them different than they portray when they act so well. Bravo.The screenplay is sheer genius with wit and humour like the fan of Woody Alan, I'm sure David Seidler is. BRAVO, everyone involved, I hope it was the joy to produce as it was to watch. I got the feeling, and can only hope it is true, that the making of this film is what builds great comradery that all artists seek. Is it true? Well, that makes it official, ball in your court.

Sucker Punch," Freedom (ART) requires Imagination of all possibilities.
","I agree with the first reviewer that gave this movie time to sink in. As I find the themes popping up in conversations in coffee shops and cocktail parties, the violence fades as the shear creative fantasy of considering all options in creating art in life. In creating beauty, artists have to have the freedom to consider all the options, IMHO. Both good and bad, and the conscious choice of beauty as the Dr. Suess book: I have brains in my head and shoes on my feet, which way I go depends on me. Most choices are situational as the dance in this movie, imagine the creativity once given the freedom to let freedom sing. Bravo.Lawson Ransom Canyon",Null,1,1,13 October 2011
Django Unchained," Testimony On How Far We've Come !!
","How ever 'hard' or violent you think this movie is, reality was much worse. I think you will be rooting for not black or white, rather whoop and cheer for what is right. Samuel Jackson was a surprise. Foxx, the usual greatness. Favorite quote: 'You a freeman and choose to wear that?' Haven't we all been there at one time? This movie makes me proud of how far we have come and to realize that the next stage of world peace and equality are possible. Spielbergs' Lincoln is so East coast and QT is so Texan. Wonderful, smart shock and awe. No horses were harmed in the making of this movie and nobody really died at CandyLand, just a movie and I don't feel desensitized towards the sacredness of human life, in fact I'm inspired to help the cause for all of us riding off into the sunset in peace. That is what we all want, really.",10,1,6,5 January 2013
Jack Reacher," ' how many would live their life like me? ' Jack Reacher
","Why do you read reviews? I like getting an idea if I should consider a movie from a random comment, if it strikes me, I'm more inclined to give it a go. But really I write for myself, to see if I can get a clarity about the time I spent watching a movie that moves me. I can usually find a good line or scene that is original and that can be enough. In one scene Jack says, 'How many wish they were born, knowing what they know now, ask yourself, how many would do things the same way all over again and how many would live their life like me?' The movie is full of 'thinking' commentary, do you think? All the time. The movie asks questions about how we live our lives, make our choices and consider the next move. The logical questions, that I didn't consider makes me want to read Childs more. Makes me want to be clearer about choices I have to make vs. no choice in the matter. Highly recommended for the raise of an eyebrow, a shirk from the desk sergeant, evil vs bad choices are displayed with such skill I just have to say something, tell a friend, talk about the insinuations. Thank you writers and director, I have been moved and better for watching this.",10,4,11,3 January 2013
Cloud Atlas," Fun Theory; Good Entertainment, Good message, Better World
","I can't imagine taking time to write for a mediocre film. Either you should go see it, or take the warning not to waste your time. Go see Cloud Atlas. Why???, that is the reason you read this, the reason I try to connect with you, to make a better world of course. Yepp, can't help it, won't try to stop it, lots of work to do and this movie in a very entertaining way educates you, your family and friends that we are all in this world together, not just now, but we've crossed paths in the past. Our spirits and progeny will cross again with a vague feeling of strange familiarity not to be realized in the future. None the less because of that connection we accept no criminal abuse and strive to have a life, respect other lives and move on.... Enough already, see if you don't agree, I think we connected and you will find the goodness. To be continued. MarkL",10,3,7,10 December 2012
Green Book," IF VIGGO IS IN THE MOVIE, I'M GOING
","Viggo makes a character good at heart. Even in his violent scenes, the anger is understandable. As a history lesson for the way it was, it took men like this to push the envelope. Like when Howard Zinn went down south to teach at an all black girls school. Viggo sees the bigotry in his fellow whites and crushes it where he can, he's a good example for anyone that cares, IMHO. Great movie. Lawson di Ransom Canyon",10,14,29,3 January 2019
Sully," A movie that makes you want to be a better pilot !!!
","Jack Nicholson in searching for a compliment to Helen Hunts' character gleefully declares in As Good As it Gets, that she 'makes me want to be a better man' I know nothing of the photography, diriction or makeup, but all involved with this movie (including those of us that paid to see it) should feel proud of the message and pass it on.Lawson di Ransom Canyon",10,1,1,11 February 2020
