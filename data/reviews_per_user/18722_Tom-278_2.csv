The Blair Witch Project," so very stupid
","I think it's ridiculous that so many people actually thought this was good. I've taken real college courses, and I know what it's like to stay up all night working on a project the night before it is due.  I do not, however, expect my instructor to think it was that great, let alone millions of people to pay money for it.  These kids just sat around in the woods and bullshitted for a few hours and got it on tape.  Anyone could do that.  The only thing worse than this movie was the fact that people are dumb enough to buy in to it",Null,0,0,21 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," By far the best movie I have ever seen.
","Just last summer I became a proud member of the United States Army.  As the son of a retired Army officer and the grandson of a World War II veteran, this movie hit somewhat close to home.    Never before have I seen such a realistic portrayal of battle.  Anyone who sees this movie should keep in mind the sacrifice men and women have made for them and be reminded not to take simple everyday freedoms for granted.  When CPT Miller says to PVT Ryan 'Earn this,' he is speaking to us all.  We must never forget the cost at which our freedom was gained, and never disgrace ourselves and our country.",10,0,1,3 May 1999
