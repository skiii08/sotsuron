Black Swan," Am I the only one who believes this film is underrated?
","The King's Speech, The Social Network, Toy Story 3 and even The Fighter were seen as far more fit to pick up the 'Best Picture' Oscar last year. The only thing this film even had a chance at was the 'Best Actress' award for the terrific portrayal of Nina by Natalie Portman, which thank God it won.Where was the credit for Barbara Hershey, Mia Kunis and Vincent Cassel? As far as anyone was concerned Natalie Portman was the only one who deserved any recognition.This is a disturbing, nightmarish film in which the little details are crucial. I am not normally squeamish, but I found myself cringing at the sight and the sound of bones crackling, skin peeling and finger nails scratching.I feel that this film, like so many great films, will be a sleeper; and within the next 20 years it will be revealed to be one of the most artistically praiseworthy films since the end of film noir.",9,2,4,3 January 2012
