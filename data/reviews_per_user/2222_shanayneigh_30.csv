National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Kill Riley Poole!
","I kind of liked the first installment of National Treasure. It was nothing more but enjoyable escapism; sort of an Indiana Jones for kids.But in this sequel it feels like we've seen it all before. For the life of me, I can't understand why they kept Riley Poole as the comic relief side kick. That character is just plain Jar-Jar-Binks-terrible. I suppose that his plethora of lines are supposed to be witty, but they just made me want to stab him in the neck with a No. 2 pencil. In all fairness, the overall dialogue sucks and blows at the same time, which I thought was a physical impossibility.But my issues with Poole aside, the main problem with this film I had with this film is that I felt it didn't have a strong enough 'hook'. Honestly, I couldn't care less if Nicolas Cage's great-grandfather (or whatever the hell it was) is accused of being complicit in a murder committed about 150 years ago, and they have to find a secret something in order to clear his name. Now I sort of understand why George Lucas said that the long gap between Indy 3 & 4 was due to the fact that they couldn't find a strong enough McGuffin around which the story revolves.I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this movie.",3,4,7,7 May 2008
Blade Runner 2049," An hour too long
","I don't know why so many filmmakers today confuse slow with profound and dull with visionary. The first two acts take up almost two hours of screen time. Would anything really change if you compressed it into an hour? Oh, I guess you would lose a lot of meaningful shots of Gosling staring glumly into the distance.If Deckard didn't want himself or the kid to be found and taught people how to hide their tracks, he sure did a horrible job at it considering how many obvious clues they left behind (good job carving a date into the tree under which the secret remains of Robomom were hidden). I know the smug fanboy choir will tell me to watch a Transformers movie instead. Hey, if you liked this movie, good for you. I thought it was a painfully boring pretentious mess without any kind of narrative drive or interesting characters to speak of. In other words, much like the original Blade Runner then. It's all glossy surface and pretty visuals.Denis Villeneuve is one of the most uneven filmmakers working today, in my opinion. I haven't been able to see any of his earlier work like Incendies or Polytechnique. The first Villeneuve movie I saw was Prisoners, and that was absolutely fantastic. I loved it. I was not too fond of his next movie, Enemy. Sicario was great on a second viewing. Arrival was a pretentious dumpster fire.",3,2,3,21 January 2018
In Bruges," They're filming midgets!
","Wow, what a little gem this movie turned out to be. I had heard absolutely nothing about it, and just decided to rent it a random. To say the least, I was pleasantly surprised.In Bruges turned out to be a wonderful black comedy about two hit men spending time i the Belgian town of Bruges, waiting for a call detailing their next assignment.The script was very good, but the dialogue is nothing but excellent! There are so many wonderful moments and hilarious one-liners, but it never feels forced or strained. Instead, the comedy comes naturally from the situations and the characters.I don't think I've ever seen Colin Farrell in a comedic role before, but he delivers a fantastic performance. The same said can be said about the rest of the cast who were all wonderful.In Bruges was one of the best and funniest movies that I've seen this year, and I've seen quite a bunch. It's quite rare with a movie that manages to balance drama and comedy so well.It is definitely a movie that I am likely to watch many times again in the future. Actually, I had to pause the movie about half way through to send an email to my friends, recommending this film. Don't miss it!",9,3,7,21 June 2008
Rocketman," A school play hiding behind good music
","To call the characters two dimensional would be giving the writer and director too much credit. Every single character is one note. The brusque cigar chomping producer. The other devilish producer. The aloof parents. Poor Elton seems to have been completely surrounded by total a-holes his whole life. The only character and his relationship to Elton that is a bit more fleshed out is Bernie Taupin. Probably because he's still friends with Elton. Maybe this is what happens when someone (and their significant other) produce their own biopic.The only thing worse than the characters is the storytelling, which is about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the balls. It reeks of amateur hour. Everything is wildly predictable. I watched this movie with a group of friends, and we laughed throughout the whole movie at its inept storytelling.Some examples:When Elton is auditioning for music school and forgot to bring his sheet music I said: 'I bet he's going to play what the teacher just played, and do so perfectly.'When he stopped playing and she asked why I said: 'He's going to tell the teacher 'Because that's where you stopped'.'When Elton gets out of rehab I said: 'I bet they're going to play 'I'm still standing'.'The examples go on and on and on. And this is not because me and my friends are psychic or geniuses, it's just one hell of a poorly written movie.When Elton and Bernie move into an apartment they meet their female landlord sitting on the stoop. If I remember correctly they only say hello, and she's given about 15 seconds of screen time. The next scene Elton is racked with anxiety and feeling of guilt about being gay, and how he's going to tell his girlfriend. The one we have seen for roughly 15 seconds. Here's a friendly tip to the writer of this movie: If you want your audience to sympathize with, or even feel something for, the characters you write, how about we get to know them a little bit?But if you think they only do this once in this movie, you would be mistaken. Later on Elton meets a woman when he makes another album. I think they only meet in one scene (maybe two), and then they get happily married. Smash cut to them coming out from separate bedrooms, having their breakfast together in silence, clearly unhappy with the whole situation. Again, as a viewer I feel absolutely nothing, since I have only met this character for a few minutes in only a handful of scenes, yet this is supposed to be a big moment in Elton's life.The music is great, of course. But if you think you're going to learn anything about how that music was created, you'd be wrong. Everything comes to Elton as instant inspiration apparently. Nothing is tried out or experimented on, everything is just perfect from the start.This was not one for the history books.",3,0,0,22 November 2019
Fury," Macho, macho man
","There's nothing in this film that you haven't seen in another thousand war movies before. What is perfectly clear is that David Ayer is a hack writer. The story doesn't matter, nor do the characters. The dialogue is laughable. I challenged myself if I could guess the next line, and that was no problem at all. This script is filled to the brim with clichés.If one is to believe the stories about the production of this film, Ayer put his actors through hell, egging them on to be macho a-holes against one another. For someone who used to work in this field I can tell you that it only results in a miserable shoot, not a more authentic product. They're actors, trust them to do their job. Or perhaps Ayer is simply too much of a failure as a director to be able to coax a good performance out of his actors without treating them like dirt.The level of testosterone in this movie is ridiculous. Everyone in the cast is so desperately trying to out-macho one another, Jon Bernthal is painful to watch. Michael Peña is playing the same character that he does in every movie, Michael Peña. He might be the nicest guy in Hollywood, but he keep getting gigs as an actor is beyond me. A pitcher with late stage Lou Gehrig's disease has more range. I have apparently seen some of Logan Lerman's work as a child actor, but it made zero impression on me. Which describes my impression of him in this movie. And Brad Pitt's greatest contribution is inspiring the haircuts of a million Chads.Also, everyone who knows the least bit about World War 2 knows that the ones who mostly bore the brunt against the Nazi forces were the soldiers of the Soviet Union. Any chance Hollywood will make some movies about them?",3,0,2,1 May 2020
Train to Busan," Amazing performance by that young girl
","The movie itself was pretty good. It felt almost like an old Irwin Allen disaster movie like The Towering Inferno or The Poseidon Adventure, with disparate groups of people being confined to a location or set piece where they have to confront and overcome adversity.But what stood out most to me was the performance by Kim Su-an who played the little girl Soo-an. In my view, the Korean acting style can at times be a bit theatrical or melodramatic. But not one beat of Kim Su-an's performance felt false. It was dramatic and emotional without crossing the line into melodrama or schmaltz. Very impressive for an actress who must have been around 9-10 years old or so when the movie was produced.",8,2,4,11 June 2017
World War Z," Mediocre hasbara
","This film isn't the train wreck we were expecting in light of its production problems, not is it a masterpiece. It has very little to do with the book (also mediocre) other than its title.It would be interesting to see the original ending, with the battle on the Red Square, instead of the Damon Lindelof milquetoast third act. Yes, it would be out of character for Pitt's everyman supermodel doctor to turn into Rambo, but at least it might have been interesting.Also, this movie follows Zionist propaganda to the letter. The dangerous bloodthirsty savages are on the other side of the wall (the Palestinians are the zombies obviously), and the coexist-peaceniks on the inside are the threat to the Jewish state's existence. Subtle.",5,0,1,19 April 2020
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Storybook review
","Once upon a time there lived a young prince named Dastan. Even though the prince was Persian, he spoke like a cockney chimney sweep (with sporadic touches of Australian).The prince was an athletic young fellow, climbing walls and jumping between buildings, in a manner reminiscent - not of the Prince of Persia game franchise - but of the hero Altair from Assassin's Creed, with some shots being direct homages (read: ripoffs).The olden days of yore in Persia was a wondrous period, filled with hammy acting, crappy CGI, and Persians who speak Arabic instead of Persian (save for the main characters who speak Queen's English).But it was also a time of great peril, with one of the greatest dangers being a clan of wizard ninjas called 'Hassansins' (not a typo) - predating the existence of the real Hashshashins by roughly 1500 years.One day, for reasons which are not entirely clear, the prince and his royal family invade a sacred city. There he comes across a young princess with full, luscious lips and annoying voice, and the two embark on an adventure together.Sparks fly between the young couple. Well, not the young couple of *this* film, but the one from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise - something which this movie desperately aspires to be. The couple in this movie has the chemistry of a vacuum, and the screen fizzles as they deliver their supposedly witty banter.They charge to and fro in the Persian country side, bumping into comedy sidekicks and gallant black men who (of course) die first.The couple is trying to stop something, which isn't entirely clear, from happening. Or are they trying to make something happen? The viewer can barely remember, as he couldn't care less by this point.",1,30,62,26 August 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Kill your darlings
","Well, now I've seen the third installment in the Pirates franchise. I'm not very impressed. The things that felt fresh in the first movie now just feel tedious.For example, captain Jacks queer-positive antics which gave the first movie some spark now are a bit dull. You can fell how they are trying to cash in on his style by cramming as much of it in the two sequels as possible, and you feel a bit fed up with it after a while and wish they'd just get on with the story. The introduction to Jack in the third movie (surely it can't be a spoiler that he returns in this one?) is a scene that just goes on and on. It may have been five minutes long, but it felt like it dragged on for half an hour. The whole scene feels constructed to give the audience as much of wacky Jacks crazy antics as possible. I say alright already. And this come from someone who loves Johnny Depp as an actor.The first hour of the film is tedious, and it's already now dragging its heels (sadly, it doesn't get much better). Why oh why does it have to be three hours long! Verbinski just has got to learn how to kill his darlings. Yes, battles are fun and special effects are cool, but if it goes on for too long it just gets plain boring (especially the final battle).Unfortunately I can't remember where I read it, but I think it was Bloom (I may be wrong) who said that there was some confusion while shooting the movie because of the ever changing script. Rather, I'd say that the crew made it up as they went along. The story is messy and the dialogue as poorly written (I never did get the 'Aaargh, matey' captain from the Simpsons out of my head).I quite liked Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven (not the crapfest I expected it to be) and Keira Knightley, well she's Keira Knightley, what can I say (be still my heart!). But the couple has zero chemistry on screen. You really don't get what she sees in Blooms character (or is it just me that's jealous?).The special effects are OK, which I think is a result from how quickly you grow accustomed to things. I remember seeing the first installment and was insanely impressed by the special effects, especially the scene in the cave where Depp and Rush are fighting, where they run in and out of the moonlight. Still one of the best special effects sequences I've seen. In the second movie the thing that made me raise my eyebrows was the crew of the Flying Dutchman, and especially Bill Nighy's character. But this time around most things were met by a big yawn and a wish that they'd move on with the story instead.Spend your money on David Fincher's Zodiac instead. Yes, it's a totally different genre, and yes it's slow. But it's still the best movie to be released this summer (so far).",2,3,11,24 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," The comedy ruined this movie
","After Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool (both movies I love) made a ton of money it's obvious that the bean counters at Marvel think that piling on jokes is the answer to making a great movie (and, of course, money). The problem with that is that the tone for this movie is way off. It's supposed to be dealing with Ragnarök, which is (very simplified) the death of gods and end of the world. Go back and watch the scenes in Avengers: Age of Ultron where Thor has a vision of Ragnarök and compare the tone in that movie with this one. You don't really feel like there's anything at stake when there's (supposedly) witty dialogue and slapstick going on in every goddamn scene. It effectively undercuts everything in the movie. But the cardinal sin is that the comedic parts aren't very funny, although I have to say that I chuckled a bit at emo teen Hulk (surely it can't be a spoiler that the Hulk shows up in this movie since he's in the trailer and on the poster?). After a while it became embarrassing to watch everyone on screen scrambling for cheap laughs. It reached its apotheosis when the sloshed Valkyrie drunkenly fell off the ramp, in a performance that would make even third rate porn actors blush.The only thing I've seen directed by Taika Waititi is (except for a few episodes of 'Conchords') is 'What We Do in the Shadows', which had some OK scenes and an amusing premise, but was hardly a knee-slapper. But one things that's clear is that he's no James Gunn.The most impressive thing about this movie is that it made the first two Thor movies seem pretty damn good.",2,3,6,16 March 2018
Life of Pi," Not my cup of tea
","This movie sure looks good, it has amazing VFX. But the hokey, mumbo jumbo, new age religious propaganda was too much for me to swallow. The only thing more shallow than the overarching theme (which is about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the balls) is the main character. What an overrated movie.",2,0,1,26 April 2020
Baby Driver," Just a gimmick
","Being a huge fan of the Cornetto trilogy, I had high hopes for this movie. But I have to say that I had the same feeling I had when watching 'Hardcore Henry' which was based on earlier music videos for its director's band.What might be a cool concept for a 4 minute video (POV action vs. character action and cuts in beat to the music) is something different from it being a solid foundation upon which to build a 90+ minute film. Once the initial excitement is gone, then what's left in the form of character and story? Not much, it turns out. We don't really get to know the characters except for little glimpses here and there. The story is as rote as it can get, not to mention that it violates its own logic at times. And what can be said about the love story other than it is utterly unconvincing? I don't remember seeing Ansel Elgort in anything else, but it's not often that one sees something as wooden as Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars prequels. Jamie Foxx plays Jamie Foxx. Jon Bernthal does his usual tough guy schtick. The only one remotely interesting in this movie is Jon Hamm, but that is such a minor character.That being said, the car stunts in this movie are fantastic, and if their claims that virtually none were done with CGI or green screen is correct, that can only be commended. But good stunts alone does not a good movie make. Too bad it didn't spend some of the time used to work on securing soundtrack rights to develop the story and characters more.",3,2,4,6 December 2017
Quantum of Solace," I blame Bourne
","Ever since the two last Bourne movies came out and made a bit of money, the film industry has suffered from a severe case of ADD. It now seems mandatory for directors to partake in the George Lucas 'faster-more-intense' and Paul Greengrass 'shakycam-mounted-on-top-of-paint-blender' schools of film making, only now it's called 'contemporary gritty action.' It seems like the whole movie was shot hand held with a 200mm lens, operated by a guy with Parkinson's disease. As icing on the cake, no cut is longer than three frames.I guess the underlying logic is that this will make the movie more 'real' and 'documentary-like'. The only thing it makes me feel is nauseous. I can't stand this trend in film making. To be honest, it feels like a cop out, like they can't trust their stunt team to do well enough, and have to shield their performance in shaky images and hysterical cutting. And surprise surprise, it turns out that the second unit director of this movie, Dan Bradley, worked on the last two Bourne movies.But technical aspects aside, the story was less than engaging, which is a shame since I have an interest in the specific MacGuffin of the movie, having even written an academic article about it.I think the main problem is that I don't really care about any of the characters. Craig may stare intensely and bite down as hard as he wants to, but I still don't really care about Bond. It's not that I don't like the Bond movies (I own all the other movies on DVD), I just don't buy this new story line where they try to make him into a sort of Bourne-light. I say let Bourne be Bourne, and Bond be Bond.Olga Kurylenko sure is pretty to look at, but her character here is about as memorable as her character in Max Payne: one big yawn. As for Mathieu Almaric, he feels a bit too pathetic to be a criminal mastermind, although I like the whole thing that they don't give him an eye patch or scars, but that he's ordinary looking.This was one incoherent mess of a film (what was the deal with the horse race?) that I'm not likely to watch again, nor am I likely to purchase the DVD.",2,25,32,20 March 2009
JFK," One of the best movies ever made
","Whether you buy Stone´s theory regarding the murder of JFK or not, this is one of the best movies ever made. The Director´s Cut runs for 3 hours and 17 minutes and Stone never lets go of your attention during those 3+ hours. I have read neither Garrissons nor Prouty´s books, but it´s an amazing amount of facts that are squeezed into these 3 short hours.The momentum of this movie is outstanding. Dramaturgically it´s one of the best movies I have ever seen, much due to the amazing editing by Academy Award winners Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia. The structure of timelayers feels almost like a cubist painting by Picasso where you´re able to see every dimension at the same time.Another well deserved Oscar went to one of my favourite cinematographers of all time, Bob Richardson. Similar to Natural Born Killers, another Stone-Richardson collaboration among many, he plays with various filmstocks and formats, fooling your eye to the extent that the re-enactment of JFK´s murder feels almost documentary. The overhead lighting at Antoine´s Restaurant, the shifts and fades when Garrison is reading the Warren Report, the use of light hot-spots giving you that white 'fuzz'....  The list goes on and on.The cast is flawless. This is really an ensemble movies although Costner, who´s never been better before or since, is the major star. The movie benefits from not being packed with A-list stars, which I believe would have reduced the sense of 'reality'. It feels as if Oldman was born to play Lee Harvey Oswald. Pesci delivers, as always. I get just as frustrated with Rooker´s character every time I see the movie, a perfect casting.As was not surprised when this movie did not win the Academy Award for Best Movie, since it´s far to politically incorrect for Hollywood´s taste. But for the life of me, I can´t understand how they could overlook Stone´s directing.This movie is a definite must-see.",10,6,22,12 June 2004
The Mist," Crap movie, awesome ending
","No, I won't give away the ending, but let's just say that it ended exactly like I hoped it would. Just imagine what's going through the mind of that character...I haven't read the novella by King, but judging from this movie there wasn't enough meat in that short story to last a full two hour movie. It started out okay, but after a while it started to become a bit dull.Considering that it's a fairly new movie, it has some of the worst special effects I have ever seen (The Langoliers, another King fare, comes to mind), which is either a result of a poor budget or shoddy craftsmanship by the CG artists. I think that the major mistake that they do is showing too much of the monsters, and way too often. Just think of Jaws or Alien, where we barely see the monsters (it you can call a shark monster), but they are a whole lot more suspenseful than this movie.In fact, the look and feel of the entire movie screams of low budget. I know, 18 million isn't a whole lot of dough, but there are ways to stretch a dollar to make it feel like a bigger budget. The Usual Suspects, which had a budget of 6 million, is just one example (although admittedly that movie isn't special effects-laden). One of Darabont's previous films, The Shawshank Redemption, was made for only 25 million, and that's a period piece, which isn't exactly cheap.For the life of me, I can't understand why this movie's got a 7.6 rating. Maybe it's the ending. Judging the movie by the last ten minutes, I would easily give it an 8, but looking at the whole thing, it's not worth more than 3.",3,0,4,28 March 2008
A Quiet Place," Please don't make this into a franchise
","Finally something original and good! That's hard to come by in this age of prequels, sequels, reimaginings, reboots, spin offs and adaptations of everything from books and comics to board games and amusement park rides. The acting is strong and the directing is superb. The silence really works wonders, it creates a tense atmosphere. But what are the chances it will work again in a (inevitable?) sequel? I hope they don't make sequels and turn this gem into a franchise. How many horror franchises can you name that have not come with diminishing returns?",8,0,1,8 July 2018
The Hurt Locker," The usual US propaganda
","Technically, there's nothing wrong with this movie. But nothing spectacular either, I might add.I have no particular views on 'The Hurt Locker' winning the Academy Award for Best Movie, considering that 2009 was a spectacularly dull movie going year (don't even get me started with Pocahontas-cum-Smurfs!)This movie hides behind a thin veneer of 'war is hell', but never for one second - like most American war movies - veer from the 'support the troops' discourse (in fact, the people in the US armed forces are described as 'superheroes' in the supplemental material on the DVD). Although war might be hell, we always are supposed to sympathize with those (supposedly) brave and gallant men and women who are fighting it, never portraying them in a negative way, or even delivering the slightest criticism towards the actions of US troops.This, of course, is true of most movies claiming to be anti war. Those who dare step outside the propagandist 'support the troops' framework and deal with the atrocities perpetrated by US soldiers are punished by being accused of treason (like Brian De Palma who did 'Redacted', a fictionalized account about the Mahmudiyah killings, where an entire Iraqi family was murdered and a 14 year old girl gang raped and murdered by US troops) or punished economically (like Nick Broomfield's 'Battle for Haditha', a movie about the massacre where 24 civilians where massacred in their homes by US troops, being shown in one single theater, raking in a whopping 10,000 dollars in its theatrical run).Whenever someone from the US military is a bad guy in a movie, it's always some rogue element - never that the military in itself is bad and commits atrocities directed towards civilians on a regular basis. This criticism isn't limited to movies dealing with the Iraq war and subsequent occupation, but it's valid for just about any military conflict in which the US armed forces are engaged. And of course there are examples like 'The Rock' where the military bad guys really turn out to be good at heart, fighting for their brethren who have been betrayed by the government (it's funny how movies are critical towards some nondescript behemoth 'government', but are silent when it comes to the armed wing of the same).In 'The Hurt Locker' the US troops might as well have been wearing white hats, and all the cardboard cutout Iraqis black hats, because this movie is about as multidimensional as an old western when it comes to good guys and bad guys. In this movie Iraqis fulfill the same function as the Somalis in 'Black Hawk Down' - a faceless crowd of bad guys ready to be gunned down in scores (except for one token character; most likely a result of liberal guilt).In the DVD extras, Bigelow claims to want to 'put the audience into the soldier's shoes'. Her lack of interest in the plight of the Iraqis under occupation is blatantly obvious. In fact (if memory serves me right), all violence directed towards Iraqi civilians is perpetrated by other Iraqis. The US soldiers are just there to protect Iraqis. The movie is well in line with the talking points of the US regime (it doesn't matter if it's run by Republicans or Democrats - same sh*t, different suit).This movie is just another example of a cowardly movie industry, resulting in a film which is anti war in name only. Always a good way of getting movie going liberals to ease their guilt.",1,46,69,7 May 2010
1917," Technical marvel, mediocre movie
","1917 reminded me a lot of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk (which I prefer over 1917).In both movies we are thrust straight into the action, with no backstory and the main characters essentially blank slates. Both movies have simple plots with one clear objective: to stop the charge in 1917, and to get off the beach and go home in Dunkirk. Moreover, both movies rely heavily on a gimmick: the single take in 1917 and the play with time (one hour, one day, one week) in Dunkirk.In essence, if you cross Dunkirk with the last 15 minutes of Peter Weir's Gallipoli stretched out into two hours, you get 1917.This recipe didn't really work for me. The only thing more paper thin than the plot are the characters (a generous use of that term). I guess the reason for them being blank slates in both 1917 and Dunkirk is to make it easier for the audience to walk a mile in their shoes. In Dunkirk this works since the plot essentially is about wanting to escape a grave threat, that's the only motivation needed. Not so much in 1917 once Blake kicks the bucket. It doesn't help that the actor playing Schofield, who we're stuck with for the rest of the movie, isn't very good.How 1917 managed to get nominated for best screenplay is beyond me. The dialogue falls flat. The pacing is glacial. In Dunkirk you really feel like you're in a fight against time, something which is emphasized by Hans Zimmer's score. In 1917 they don't seem to be in a rush once they leave their trench. Even Blake, whose brother is about to die if he can't deliver the message in time, acts as if he's taking a pleasant stroll through the countryside. Not even a light jog? Come on.And when the story and characters work you start focusing on other things. Like the airplanes. If they were in such a rush, it almost makes you wonder why they didn't send someone in a plane to deliver this urgent time-sensitive message.Technically, however, this movie is amazing. The cinematography is astounding, and the Oscar very well deserved. And I'm quite surprised it didn't also win for its magnificent production design.Although it will never happen, I would love to see the entire movie in split screen, one box the final image, and the additional boxes how they shot it. But that's the only reason for me watching this movie again.Just ask yourself this: If this movie had the exact same plot, dialogue and characters but didn't use the continuous take gimmick, would it still be hailed as a masterpiece? My guess is no.This movie was by no means bad. It was just OK.",6,1,3,12 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Guardians of the Fury Road Galactica
","The first couple of minutes set up the tone for the rest of the movie. First of all, it established the mighty Imperial general as an ineffectual idiot who has problems even grasping the concept of microphones. Secondly, if you though stormtroopers were horrible at aiming, just wait until you see the Imperial fleet. If one single fighter plane is able to take out every single gun of an entire battle cruiser, it makes the Empire look like the Keystone Cops and in no way a credible threat to the rebellion (which is further emphasized by their General being a pouty kid). One wonders why the rebellion even bothers to amass an armada when apparently one fighter per battle is all you need.And finally we learn that this movie will be jam packed with lame attempts at comedy. It's obvious that someone at Disney has watched Guardians of the Galaxy far too many times. The main storyline with the armada on the run going straight forward was the slowest and least exciting chase sequence since OJ Simpson's failed attempt at a getaway. OK, let's buy that their ships were able to go slightly faster than the Imperial ships. Was there any reason for the Empire to not call for backup? The chase sequence lasts at least 16 hours in their universe, and in that time Finn and Rose are able to go to one planet, be imprisoned and escape, and get back to the armada. One would think that the Empire would be able to scramble some backup from another system in that time. Or how about having half the Imperial fleet on site use their hyperdrive to get in front of the rebellion armada? Or, since were in three dimensional space, jump some of their ships in front of, below, above and to the side of the rebellion armada, attacking them from all sides?If Luke Skywalker didn't want to be found and ran away to the most desolate place in the universe and have nothing to do with the rebellion, one can only wonder why he left a map to his whereabouts in the last movie.The Finn and Rose storyline is completely meaningless as it changes nothing and has no impact on the story. Finn came close to serving a purpose in this movie when he was about to sacrifice himself, just to have his idiot new friend and love interest (apparently) smash into his speeder, cementing his role in this story as utterly useless. I have loved Star Wars ever since I was a kid, and I watched this in the cinema with my girlfriend who couldn't care less about Star Wars. Interestingly enough we both laughed out loud at Rose's dying (?) words about the rebellion being about love or some bullsh*t, as those words came right after she had doomed all her friends and the entire rebellion to an apparently certain death through her kamikaze decision. Rey is a Mary Sue once again, effortlessly holding her own against the Supreme Leader's elite body guard without prior training except shadowboxing against a rock for five minutes. At the end of the movie (almost) all of the characters are back to where they started, having learned nothing but to blindly bow down to authority, apparently. Some rebels they are.This movie took a huge, steaming dump all over the Star Wars legacy. Apparently the force and the Jedi mean nothing anymore in the Star Wars universe, rendering all previous movies meaningless. I wasn't a big fan of The Force awakens, but that movie almost seems like a masterpiece in retrospect.In a way it's impressive that the prequel movies aren't the worst in the series anymore. This movie is the embodiment of midichlorians.",1,1,1,14 January 2018
Mission: Impossible II," The weakest link in the series
","I've just finished watching through the three MI films (again). And it's somewhat peculiar that the weakest of the three action films is the one made by the most pronounced action-director of them all, John Woo.It's too bad, because I'm a big fan of John Woo, who's made some of my favorite action movies of all time (Hard Boiled and Face/Off immediately come to mind). But I don't know what went wrong here. His signature use of slow motion, which has worked beautifully in the past, is simply tiresome in this movie.The scenes drag on for too long. I'm not advocating the George-Lucas-faster-more-intense-ADD /Bourne/ Bond/ camera-mounted-on-top-of-paint-blender-style of film making, which is so popular in action movies today. But the (for example) slow-motion-flamenco, quasi-sexual-foreplay-car-chase and motorcycle-jousting scenes just go on and on and on to the point that I just want start throwing things at the TV and shout 'Get on with the story!' Sadly, the story (if there indeed is one) is less than engaging, and the characters are far too dull. I don't buy the supposed chemistry between couch-jumper Cruise and token black girl. The main villain played by Dougray Scott (surely, that can't be a spoiler?) is weak and bland. Anthony Hopkins is there to pick up a paycheck, no more, no less.",3,2,4,4 September 2009
Mission: Impossible," Still the best one in the franchise
","I first saw this movie at its gala premiere, and was blown away. I have watched it several times since, and just rewatched it in 2020. It's far superior to its sequels - which are not bad movies, they're just not as good as the first one. The sequels are by now fairly generic action movies, the ingenuity, which the first movie has in spades, is pretty much out the window by now. In the later sequels I couldn't even tell you what the story is about without cheating, because the story doesn't matter, it's just an excuse to tie action set pieces together. Although I hadn't seen the first one in years I could still tell you what the story is about. I saw the latest one just a few months ago and I couldn't tell you the story if my life depended on it. And for all the sound and fury of the sequels where Cruise et al up the ante with every new installment, no sequence in any of the movies has been as thrilling as the nine minute almost completely silent wire sequence in the first one.",9,0,2,11 April 2020
The Witch," Fails miserably
","For the life of me I can't understand why they chose to market this movie as a horror movie. The tone in the trailer does not for one bit match the tone of the movie. No wonder a lot of people call this movie boring if they went in with high expectations after having seen the trailer.The rookie director makes one huge mistake after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie when he shows that the witch is indeed real. Had he not done so the witch might have worked as, say, an allegory of religious hysteria or coming of age. But no, the witch is real and there's no room left for ambiguity.But the major flaw of this movie is that it simply isn't scary, the one defining characteristic of a horror movie. The pacing is glacial. And a slow horror movie is fine if you're building to some payoff. But no, the movie sort of trundles along without any real excitement. When we do get nearer to the end there are two climactic moments that weren't scary, but funny, I assume unintentionally so. The main character's little brother has what seems like an epiphany on his death bed which was so over the top it almost felt campy. And when her two twin siblings freak out and accuse her of being a witch, forget how to pray, and fall to the floor, they had me laughing out loud. The movie is well made. The cinematography is excellent, the sound and music is good too. As is the acting. It's just a shame that it was not scary and fails miserably as a horror movie.",1,5,9,1 August 2016
War of the Worlds," Plothole bonanza!
","This review contains major spoilers, so beware.Well, now I've seen Spielbergs version of War of the Worlds, and I'm not that impressed. In my view, Spielberg has lost the touch. I can't remember when he last made a good movie. It feels as if he makes films with his left hand nowadays, if you know what I mean. It's sloppy craftsmanship.The scenes with Scientology-boy and his obnoxious kids are horrible, as if Spielberg directed with concrete mittens. 'Subtle' is not the word to use when Spielberg shows what a irresponsible parent Scientology-boy is: He hasn't cleaned his house, there's no food (the only thing in his kitchen is an engine), he throws a baseball way to hard while spending quality time with his obnoxious son, he doesn't know any lullabies, and so on and so forth.But now to the spoilers: If the aliens have been watching us for a looong time, which is hinted at in the movie, how come they haven't figured out that we have experienced a little thing called 'evolution'? Seriously, are you gonna tell me that they've never heard of germs? C'mon. I know germs was the new big thing, the soup du jour, when Well's novel was written in 1898, but today you could expect a little bit more. If you're gonna update the story, and make it into a cuddly relationship drama with a dysfunctional family, instead of the blistering criticism against colonialism and Victorian (white) supremacy which is the original novels intention, you might as well update the story all the way.Besides, the germ-thing is not very consistent nor rooted in reality. As a previous poster wrote: 'A certain percentage of the aliens would be immune to the virus. This was unknown at the time when Wells wrote the book. If these aliens were able to catch a virus in the first place their genetic make up is similar to that of humans or any creature on Earth for that matter and like any creature on Earth some are more susceptible to a virus and then some are naturally immune to the same virus.' And what's with the thing on the tripod that tries to suck up Scientology-boy. Was it their intention to make it look like a sphincter? Let me tell you, we were rolling on the floor, laughing. Call me immature, but it looked real funny to me and my girlfriend.Why was the soldier trying to help Scientology-boy when the giant sphincter tried to devour him? He hadn't done jack sh*t to try and save some of the other people in the basket when they were sucked up by the giant sphincter. He couldn't have seen the hand grenades that Scientology-boy was packing, remember that the soldier first spotted the rings in Scientology-boys hand after the giant sphincter let him go? Although, I would have LOVED to see one thing that wasn't in the movie. How the h*ll did the obnoxious son escape the GIANT, MASSIVE fireball when he runs over the hill??? The special effects look awful in some scenes. The movie looks like a rush job, which probably is explained by the seven month window for production. Some effects are brilliant though. As is the sound.We had a few laughs watching this movie, which we quite enjoyed as light escapism. It was OK entertainment, but not something I'll bother watching again.",3,2,3,12 July 2005
Wonder Woman," Oh, hi Mark!
","Gal Gadot might have a pretty face, but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Her acting and accent kept reminding me of Tommy Wiseau in The Room. And since she can't speak in anything but an Israeli accent (she's the new Schwarzenegger) the rest of the Amazon actors have to adopt fake accents. I say 'accents' - plural - because they all speak with different imaginary accents, even those supposedly related to each other, which is just one indicator of how lazy this film is.And I can't look past the fact that Gadot is a Zionist who has served in the Israeli Occupation Forces, which has oppressed the Palestinian population for decades. So when her character speaks about the plight of civilians and how she's dying to help them, it all rings false in my ears considering her background.The movie's villain is a twist, which should come as a surprise to absolutely no one. The movie is hailed as a progressive one because it stars a female character and is directed by a woman, but no one seems to notice that the major bad guy in this movie is the only one who keeps talking about the importance of peace. How progressive that those seeking peace really are untrustworthy and/or evil on the inside. That's taken straight out of the right wing playbook and fitting for a fascist propaganda show like 24.The final battle in Wonder Woman looks exactly like the final battle in Batman vs Superman. Seriously, you could lift clips from either movie and insert it into the other with no trouble at all.And was any exterior shot in this movie actually shot on location? It felt like a Hitchcock movie. A lot of the green screen work and compositing in this movie looked even worse than the end fight in The Avengers (Loki on a space scooter anyone?) and that was made 5 years ago.Finally, the slow motion. I feel like Zack Snyder strapped Patty Jenkins into a chair and forced her eyes open with clamps like in A Clockwork Orange and made her watch 300 on repeat. If you accentuate every single shot in a sequence with slow motion, in the end you accentuate nothing at all.This movie was absolutely dreadful.",1,7,16,9 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Do a movie, not a franchise
","First of all, I wanted to like this picture. I'm in the minority who actually liked Man of Steel and appreciate Snyder for trying something different.I also don't care about the ridiculous Marvel v DC feud. I just enjoy good comics and movies. However, after Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad I'm just about ready to give up on this line of movies, because they (and Suicide Squad in particular) were horrendous.That said, I don't know who does the casting for the Justice League series, but they must be doing it on a dare and failing miserably at it, from Jared Leto and Viola Davis in Suicide Squad to Jesse Eisenberg and Gal Gadot in Batman v Superman. Gadot is pretty to look at, but she's a horrible actress. First of all I can barely understand what she says, and when I do the delivery is so wooden and dull it makes Keanu Reeves seem like a master thespian in comparison.I don't know what part they told Jesse Eisenberg he was playing, but surely it couldn't have been Lex Luthor. Considering the amount of scenery he was chewing, he must have the digestive system of a thousand goats. The saving grace is Ben Affleck as Batman. He is fantastic in this picture.The plot is nonsensical and only serves as a 2+ hour set up for gathering the other Pokemon in the Justice League, something which came off as tacked on and contrived. I have only seen the extended version, but considering how disjointed that felt I can only imagine what a jumbled mess the theatrical version must have been. Just think of what this movie this could have been if they had ditched the obligatory franchise building and focused on telling a contained story. The callback to Man of Steel which explains the animosity between Batman and Superman is excellent and a great starting point. But after that they can't decide whether to tell this story or the beginning of a handful of other stories which will (maybe) pay off in later movies in the franchise.",4,0,0,27 March 2017
Godzilla," We followed the wrong character
","This review contains spoilers for Godzilla (2014), Executive Decision (1996) and The Village (2004).***I can sort of understand the film makers thinking 'wouldn't it be cool if we kill off the best known actor in the beginning of the movie' for pure shock value. Kind of, but not exactly, like when Steven Seagal (who, believe it or not, was kind of a big action star back then) was killed a half an hour into 'Executive Decision', or when Joaquin Phoenix was stabbed in 'The Village'.But in those movies the shift of focus worked, because the characters had motivation. Kurt Russell was a fish out of water, desk jockey analyst in a tux ('Who's this? Double-oh Seven?') trying to stop a bomb going off in an airplane before it's too late. Bryce Dallas Howard has to leave her little tight-knit community and venture out into the unknown woods where monsters reside in order to get medical supplies before her loved one dies.In Godzilla I wished we would've followed Bryan Cranston's character because the movie sets up some kick-ass motivation for him where he tries to unravel the secret behind why he had to sacrifice his wife. But instead we follow his son which could've worked if, for instance, he slowly but surely takes on his estranged father's obsession, a slow descent into madness where tries to unravel the mystery that his father tried to solve in order to avenge both his parents. But he doesn't even seem that upset or sad about the death of his father (who he doesn't seem to care that much about in the first place), he rather has a look of weird annoyance on his face a second after he watches his father plummet to his death. That was really the best take they could find?But instead we get a generic military character who specializes in bomb disposal, something which is emphasized throughout the movie, but has absolutely no effect in the end. He has a generic family with whom he shares a scene, but if you'd delete the family scenes from the movie absolutely nothing would change. What's his motivation other than 'going home'? Why is he suddenly back in the military fighting monsters, and why are we as an audience following him specifically instead of the thousands of other random soldiers? And he's not exactly a fish out of water as he's former military to begin with.Him being the son of Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche makes no difference to the character. You could easily delete the entire prologue and Bryan Cranston's character altogether, and substitute Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character with Josh Dumahel's from the 'Transformers' movies and it wouldn't make a difference. They're both generic military characters whose motivation seem to be 'I'm military, and this is what we do'.This Godzilla was such a wasted opportunity. I absolutely loved Gareth Edward's previous movie 'Monsters', a master class on how you work with a shoe string budget (the documentary on the blu-ray is definitely worth checking out), so I was most definitely looking forward to his version of Godzilla. But maybe my expectations were set a bit too high.Godzilla is by no means a bad movie. It's well made, with some good effects and excellent sound. But it's quite dull. It more or less plays like a computer game where the main character moves from one action set piece to the next: Stage 1 - Japan, Stage 2 - Hawaii, and so on. You never really care for any of the characters, and we are never given any motivation for why we as an audience even should care about them, so there's nothing at stake.",5,6,12,24 August 2014
Sin City," It's meaningless, Marge! Don't even attempt to find meaning in it!
","The words of Homer Simpson sum up my feelings for Sin City, the new grossly overrated film from grossly overrated director Robert Rodriguez.I haven't read the graphic novels by Frank Miller, so I can't tell whether the film stays true to the original or not. What I do can tell you is that the movie sucks.The visual style is compelling, but after being awestruck for the first five minutes, you start to concentrate on the content of the movie, and now is when disappointment strikes.You feel absolutely NOTHING for the characters, who are no more than caricatures, and NOT in a good way. Why should I care if a character makes it or not when I have no feelings for him or her? It's not that the characters are 'bad' or 'too violent' or 'despicable'; it's just that I don't care for them.This movie takes itself waaaay to seriously, which is a huge mistake, considering the shoddy acting, poor directing and 'flaccid, sloppy writing', to quote Robert McKee i 'Adaptation'.The extensive use of voice over gets pretty old after a while, and good old Robert McKee says it best when he says: 'Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character.' A studio executive once told me how he knew a movie was bad if he looked at his watch at any time during the screening. I could not stop looking at my watch while watching Sin City. I longed for the end credits to roll.This movie might have been good as a short or a music video, considering it's visual style, but it's just not good enough to cut it as a feature film.",2,2,4,11 July 2005
Goodfellas," 'He shoots him in the foot, he tells him to go f**k himself.'
","One of the best and funniest lines in an excellent movie.Goodfellas is, in my opinion, one of the best movies Scorsese's ever made. It has such great momentum, both dramatically and visually. Ballhaus and Schoonmaker are really at the top of their game in this movie. Fantastic.But it's all in the story. If you don't have it on paper, it doesn't matter how many cool camera angles or transitions you can come up with. The movie runs for almost two and a half hours, yet it never gets boring. It always manages to get, and keep, you interested. The script is perfect. I normally have sort of a problem with voice overs. As Brian Cox says in Adaptation: 'God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character.'But here it works wonders, it helps to propel the story along with the excellent soundtrack.And the characters... The names alone... Jimmy Two Times, Johnny Roastbeef, Joe Buddha... Why don't we see people like Frank Cicero and Frank Vincent in more movies?Not to mention Ray Liotta. I don't get why he isn't hired more often. Regardless how bad the movie is, he usually is able to make something interesting and/or funny out of his character. Take 'Copland' or 'Hannibal' or 'Heartbreakers' or 'Blow' or why not 'Narc'? Well, as always, there are exceptions. I wouldn't see 'Operation Dumbo Drop' or 'Escape from Absolom' again, even if my life depended on it...Joe Pesci is... ...well, he's Joe Pesci in this movie. But I gotta hand it to him, no one can pull off a Joe Pesci like he can! He IS funny like a clown, and he DOES amuse me!Robert De Niro's perfect as the laid back gangster Jimmy Conway who just explodes with fits of rage.As I said, one of Scorsese's best. He's one of my all-time favourite directors, but I just wish he'd stop making cr*p like Gangs of New York. The Special Edition of Goodfellas is coming out on DVD in Europe this fall, and I'll be waiting first in line to replace my old version.I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie with both a compelling story as well as great characters. Although I have to leave a little caveat, It IS violent.",10,6,12,24 July 2004
13 Hours," Team America: World Police
","This was a fine piece of imperialist, militarist propaganda masquerading as 'truth'.The truth claim is repeated over and over again in the blu-ray extras, as well as in the opening titles of the movies itself: 'This is a true story'Just 15 seconds before this claim, the opening titles also claimed that 'The CIA watched for lethal weapons before they spread to the global black market'Two years before this movie premiered Seymour Hersh published an article, 'The Red Line and the Rat Line', in London Review of Books which revealed that the purpose of the consular annex was the exact opposite of what the movie claims. The consulate's only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms. The so-called 'rat line' was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the opposition (to Assad). Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida.So right off the bat I knew that the 'truth' claim was to be taken with an enormous grain of salt.The blu-ray extras also hail Bay's aim for realism. As one actor claimed, 'His attention to detail is unbelievable, and he's committed to doing it properly'. Then we see Bay gingerly trimming the cuts on Pablo Schreiber's clothes with a small scissors. Of course, the extras also point out the military training the actors had to go through, all in the name of realism.And then Michael Bay hires an actor with the strongest Iranian accent imaginable, who obviously doesn't speak a word of Arabic, to play the Arabic interpreter Amahl. That's some attention to detail you got there, Mike. Couldn't find a single Arabic speaking actor (who, importantly,can also master the distinct Libyan Maghrebi dialect anywhere? Or perhaps realism is only interesting when it has to do with the military and guns, as per usual in Hollywood movies.And of course, since the movie is blatant propaganda, no one questions with a single word the very existence of a secret base with armed military personnel, who apparently have enough arms to fight a smaller civil war. Actually, the only one who makes sense in this whole movie is the appointed villain, the milquetoast, pudgy and balding CIA chief (in contrast to the buff military guys who Bay carefully show off shirtless and glistening with sweat) who points out that they have no jurisdiction and aren't even officially there. Of course, the other characters and the movie itself tell him to go frak himself, the stormtroopers of the empire can do as they damn well please! And of course, the blu-extras contain the usual circle jerk with people in the production tripping over each other in a competition to see who can praise the military the most.Technically, the movie is great, especially the cinematography. However, the lack of continuity where we can cut from night, to daylight, to dusk, to night again between shots is a further indication of the level of attention to detail this movie pays.Bay is a great director of action spectacle, but he has never been able to master character moments. Those parts of the movie, especially the scenes where Krasinski's character is speaking with his family, are about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. Krasinski turned out to be a great director with 'A Quiet Place', but he has never been much of an actor, and this movie is not an exception.If this movie had just presented itself as an action flick, that would have been fine. But the 'truth' claim killed it.",3,0,4,1 May 2020
Law Abiding Citizen," Unexpectedly good movie - unfortunately awful ending
","Last couple of years, there's been an upswing in vengeful vigilante movies, a genre I'm quite fond of. However, one thing that has marred the movies I've seen in this new wave is the casting of the villains, who have been way too over the top with their drama-class-bad-guy-acting. Some examples are Death Sentence and The Brave One, which are otherwise fine films.This is not the case with Law Abiding Citizen, which is cast nicely (almost) all the way from the starring role to small supporting roles. One exception though. I can't stand Jamie Foxx.Also, matters are more in shades of gray, unlike the other vigilante movies where things are more dichotomous.I'm not the biggest fan of F. Gary Gray. I feel that his previous films have been too clunky, but he does a fine job here.I have only one issue with this movie, and that's the ending. I couldn't help but rooting for Gerard Butler's character, and I feel like it was a cowardly choice on the part of the filmmakers to have him killed in the end. Some might say that it's poetic justice that he dies as a direct result of his own device, but I just feel that it's the formulaic Hollywood cliché that the bad guy has to go down in the end.Nevertheless, it's a movie well worth watching! It's not a movie which will reveal the meaning of life, but it's fun entertainment.",8,4,6,22 May 2010
