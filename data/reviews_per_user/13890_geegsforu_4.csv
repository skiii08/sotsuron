It," Think The Goonies......with a psychotic clown
","This made me laugh, jump, thrilled. I loved every moment. It had the look and feel of Stranger Things, Stand by Me and The Goonies. Story was awesome. Penny wise was as disturbing as ever, and those kids were brilliant! There were some scenes that did freak me out but it was so well made. What else can I say? ...............CHAPTER 2 anyone?",10,7,16,8 September 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Just incredible
","I went into this with an open mind and left with a broken heart. This was absolutely incredible on so many levels. The cast were superb.
Rami was brilliant as Freddie and the rest of the guys (including Tim from Jurassic Park-I KNOW RIGHT) were flawless. I actually thought the guy playing Brian May was so like him, he even sounds like him, and PETER BEALE from EASTENDERS! Wow!
Go and see this ultimate gem of a movie",10,4,6,7 November 2018
Jurassic World," If you loved the Park you'll Love the World.
","I went into the cinema with an open mind. Could they really create the same magic from the original? I would say YES! Okay, there's nobody (apart from Henry Wu-from Jurassic Park and who has a bigger role to play) in this movie from the original films but the director did state that it wasn't about throwing the same people into the same scenario over and over again. Nostalgia wise there's plenty for you to sink your teeth into and you will find yourself saying 'I remember that' which is both thrilling and comforting. The new characters are great and add a new freshness to the franchise. The CGI is actually quite impressive. I couldn't really fault it. There are a few situations in this movie where you feel that edge of seat terror (Gyrosphere scene) and also a couple of genuine funny moments. The dinosaurs are a spectacle to see and the park itself looks totally lush. The story ticks along nicely as your straight in there from the start. You of course know things are going to go awry but that's the fun of it. It certainly brought me back to my youth and my 7 year old nephew loved it as much as I did. Definitely give it a go and maybe you will feel that rich sensation of something so familiar yet something exciting and new which both combined make a genuinely mega sci-fi spectacular !!!! Basically Jurassic World ROCKED MY WORLD!!!! Go see it!",10,41,97,19 June 2015
Alien: Covenant," Why? Just why?
","When Elizabeth Shaw and David blasted off into space at the end of Prometheus, I was excited to see her next adventure. What we got was NOT this adventure. 
I loved Noomi Rapace in this movie and to kill off the next possible, iconic female lead in the next step of the franchise was just, well, lame! 
The Aliens we know don't float as particles and up peoples noses. They get laid in the throat by a facehugger! To be honest, these crazy ideas to create different aliens just makes things too complicated! And the fact that our dear aliens were created by some crazy droid is just........stupid! So, aliens evolved from humans! 
What was Ridley Scott thinking? 
You've beyond damaged your franchise and brought nothing new here. Was so disappointed.",2,1,4,12 July 2018
