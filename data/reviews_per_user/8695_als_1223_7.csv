Casablanca," Quite Excellent
","By the time I finally got around to watching Casablanca, only a few days before watching it again in one of my classes, I had already known so much about the movie, hearing it quoted millions of times, knowing the whole plot, and even what happens in the end, that I didn't even want to watch it anymore. But when it was on TV, I felt compelled to, and even though I was watching it a few days later, I am definitely glad that I did. The story is absolutely timeless, and it is something that could even happen nowadays. Bogart's Rick is still in love with Bergman's married Ilsa, who has come to Casablanca with her husband (Laszlo) so they they can escape to America, and away from the Nazi's who are after Laszlo. Throughout this time, Rick is torn between whether or not to help them escape, while wanting Ilsa all to himself. Bergman and Bogart both display such amazing acting skills, making the viewer really feel that they are in love. You can see Ilsa being torn between Laszlo and Rick and not knowing what to do as much as Rick doesn't know what to do. Aside from the story, the setting is really quite beautiful as well. The town of Casablanca, was just a really nice place to set the movie, and whenever anyone hears the name of the town, all people seem to think about is love.",7,0,3,13 December 2009
Lifeboat," Fantastic
","I love this movie. At first I was a little bit unsure about it due to the fact that the whole movie took place in a single boat. The movie seemed to move so fast that there really was no looking away. I was amused the entire time. All of the characters had their own little quirks which we got to learn about quite well since they were stuck together on a boat for a while and you can tell that none of them are too particularly happy to be aboard a lifeboat with each other. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that Willi (Walter Slezak) was able to save Gus's (William Bendix) and seem like a good guy, but then eventually have to push Gus overboard because he was too injured and too much extra baggage. This might be one of the best underrated Hitchcock movies ever made.",Null,0,0,16 December 2009
Citizen Kane," watchable
","The editing, the lighting, the visuals, the acting, the script: almost everything about this movie is watchable. I enjoyed it. Orson Welles did a fantastic job directing and writing this movie. I know why so many people love it, and why it always sits atop many 'best of' lists. I could quote several lines from this movie before I had even seen it. The story is intriguing, and Welles does an excellent job portraying Charles Kane. So while I loved the movie very much, and it was truly groundbreaking for its time, I don't think that I could watch it over and over like some people do, and it is definitely not at the top of my 'best of' list.",Null,0,1,16 December 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Groundbreaking... but only in production.
","This film may have been groundbreaking, amazing, and wonderful according to people in the early 20th century, and that may be true. But only when it comes to the production of the film. The production and editing are well done, as is the cinematography, the actors also do a fine job, but that is the extent of it. I highly doubt that I would choose to watch this movie again, and I don't think that I would have chosen to watch it in the first place based solely on the original title of the film, 'The Clansman.' I disliked the whole story from the beginning to the end, and the controversies between the north and south. I also feel that no decent film can have the Ku Klux Klan as the protagonist. The movie may have been great for its time, but those times have changed.",3,3,6,16 September 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Thoroughly Amusing
","This is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen, it was amusing and fun to watch. I have to say that my favorite part of the movie was just the characters names (Jack D. Ripper, Merkin Muffley, 'King' Kong, 'Buck' Turgidson, etc). Just hearing the characters call another character one of their obnoxiously silly names was just enough to drum up a laugh. Peter Sellers did an excellent job playing three characters, and he was able to switch back and forth between characters while making both characters very believable. While enjoying this movie, I felt that it sexualized females very much, with the only female character wearing a bikini, and then the same woman being the Playboy centerfold that 'King' Kong is reading in the cockpit, and I thought that that was the only lame part of the movie. I thought that the cinematography was very well done, and seeing the plane fly through the air in a very campy (as it would be referred to now) 60s style definitely made for a good laugh, even though it wasn't supposed to be funny. I also liked being able to learn about the scares and politics of nuclear weapons and the Cold War. I enjoyed this film, it's not my favorite, but I would definitely watch it again.",6,0,3,12 December 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," Pretty, pretty good.
","I really enjoyed John Steinbeck's novel, so I decided that I had to see this movie. The book was sad, moving, and depressing all at the same time, so I knew that the movie would be too. I was interested in seeing this, because John Ford did such a good job directing Stagecoach, that this movie had to be good as well; and it was. Fonda and Carradine do a great job and the cinematography was excellent. The natural lighting and the set lighting worked very well together. The outdoor scenery was very pretty and when they were on the road traveling I truly felt like I was on the road with them. I liked the book a lot more than the movie, but isn't that the way it always is with books and movies.",Null,0,0,16 December 2009
The Graduate," An excellent, excellent movie.
","I have seen this movie several times, and the story is something that still hits true today. There have seen several films made since The Graduate that have had the same story line, with a man falling in love with an older woman and then her daughter, but none have done it as well as The Graduate. Dustin Hoffman did an excellent job for his first above the title debut and he really makes you feel for his character and everything that he is going through. Anne Bancroft was great as Mrs. Robinson, and she really made the viewer believe that she was a much older woman pining for Hoffman's Ben Braddock, even though in actuality Hoffman is only six years younger than Bancroft. Katharine Ross did well as Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, who Braddock eventually fell in love with, but her character is nowhere near as iconic as Bancroft's and Hoffman's. While I absolutely adore the very last scene, the wedding scene, and the scene when Ben is underwater so he can deliberately not pay attention to what his parents and their friends are saying are definitely a few of my favorite scenes. Director Mike Nichols was able to make this film amazing and shock people with the affair (even though by today's standards, this is normal) due to the end of the Hays Code. And one cannot forget the soundtrack done completely by Simon and Garfunkel, that alone made the movie even more watchable.",8,0,0,12 December 2009
