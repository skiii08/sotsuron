Love and Death," Wheat with feathers, Cream Of Wheat
","FUNNY AND SMART! Woody Allen was definitely showing off his talents of how he can make his audience embrace philosophical and intellectual thoughts on life, love, death and war, while at the same time keep them rolling on the ground laughing. In the film Woody Allen does an amazing job portraying a cowardly, pessimistic, neurotic Russian who is presented with these tremendous obstacles through the movie, such as going to war, killing Napoleon and trying to win the love of his cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton) who is in love with Woody Allen's character's brother.  Keaton and Allen yet again display that famous comedic chemistry between them and both pull off both of their roles with such hilarity. This is definitely on the list of my top 20 favorite movies of all time. If you are in the mood for a good comedy then this movie is just what the doctor ordered. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie or look for when it's played on T.V.",Null,0,0,11 August 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Our natural fluids!!! Best Movie out of the 1960's
","I can't begin to say enough GOOD things about this film! I love the whole black comedy genre (which are movies that place a comedic tone to a rather morbid premise). First of all, each of the actors does an amazing job of acting out their roles (with the exception of Slim Pickens, whose character can get down-right annoying), the performance of the ultra right-winged psychotic General Jack Ripper played by Sterling Hayden was Oscar-caliber, Peter Sellers does an exquisite job playing three different characters including the title character role of Dr. Strangelove and I was deliriously amused by the part played by George C Scott. Though it may seem a little taboo to poke fun at the notion of a nuclear holocaust brought forth by the Cold War, this film is a drop dead funny and entertaining compilation of great acting, a superb screenplay, excellent directing and a FABULOUS ending sequence. Some of the scenes in the fighter jet with Slim Pickens can lag and make you want to hit the Â‘fast forward' button, but the highly entertaining scenes in the war room do more than make up for it. It's no wonder that this film was placed at #3 on the American Film Institutes 100 greatest comedies of all time. This is a must see for anyone studying film, or planning on being a movie critic. This movie is truly a classic and I could watch it another 16 times.",10,1,1,12 August 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Bad movie!!!
","First of all you can never do a remake of a movie that starred Sinatra and than expect it to live up to the original. And could they have picked a lamer cast to replace the great Rat Pack? All the actors lacked any enthusiasm and gave off the image like they were all emotionless robots with absolutely no personality. This movie was so dull and unrealistic. Not too mention ho much I missed hearing Sammy Davis Jr. singing Eee-Ooo Eleven and Dean Martin crooning to all the wide-eyed women. Do yourself a favor and pick up the original 'Ocean's Eleven' with the cast that was made to be in this movie, unless of course you enjoy watching a bunch of Hollywood pretty boys showing us yet again just how pathetic their acting skills are. They are better off just standing around looking pretty, oh wait, that's what they do in this movie. I have never written a bad review on a movie without being able to say at least one good thing for it, but it this case I have nothing good to say for it. Boring crap, nothing less.",Null,0,1,11 August 2002
