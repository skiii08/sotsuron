American Hustle," Great acting
","I just end to saw this movie for second time, (once in the theater, once in BD). This is a great movie. Maybe the story is not so great, but the acting i superb (I look for the details the second time). All the actors are great in their roles, is a pity that no one get the Oscar, all deserves of them deserves. They really transmit the inner felling of their characters at any moment, (specially while they have to con someone they don't really want to con). This movie deserve to by watched for the acting of this five actors, and if you like the genre you really would enjoy this masterpiece recreating the 60's end 70's starting period.",10,2,7,17 May 2015
Inside Out," Great Idea, Great Movie, 10 for Imagination
","This movie is great and Pixar deserve more than 10 for their great imagination; problem, not all the people understand, really, what the movie is about, so you will find a lot of bad reviews This movie is about the time when childhood ends and adolescence begins. This is a common problem for teachers in this transition time. The time when the child is to big to be a child and to child to be big. The time when all the imagination is lost and reality impacts to stay for ever. This problem, teacher know well, is marvelous treated in this movie from the inside world of the child from 5 basic emotions. It's shows how the child world collapses, in order to create a new world, the world that will be the adult world. Wonderful story from Pixar imagination that shows how the child is lost, and how the child joy has to learn to manage sadness in order to grow. Many times I ask myself when the 'child magic world ends', this movie shows clearly how this happens. In my case was when I complete my primary school and starts the secondary studies. This movie works exactly with that time period, and use an external problem to trigger that process This is a movie to learn a lot about your child, and yourself, it is not an pure entertainment. That it is why you will found so many but reviews See this movie with your child mind in order to understand your adult mind",10,7,34,10 January 2016
