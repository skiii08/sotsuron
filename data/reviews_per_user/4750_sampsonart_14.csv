Alien 3," Same 'Alien' feel as the first 2
","The reason I am rating this one so highly is because not only was it very original, the very ending was pretty unpredictable in my opinion. I never thought it would go down the way it did. Anyway, I LOVED this movie. Not as much as the first two which I give 10 stars to but it's definitely better than most want to admit and give credit to. A true alien fan will know what I'm talking about when I say it had the same feel of the whole 'alien' universe that Ridley Scott started over a decade before. A lot of people try so desperately to lump alien 3 in with movies like 'alien resurrection' or the AVP ones and those films are just not on the same level sorry. Alien 3 also had awesome acting by all the British prisoners (also original).. it was effective in inducing that exciting feeling in me when I watched the first 2.",8,1,1,18 February 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Ahead of its time
","I still can't believe this came out in 1982. It looks like it was made a lot later with better technology.. I mean 1982 had some real old lookin stinkers and E.T. was so ahead is it's time, back when Spielberg was in his prime!! I remember seeing this at the theater multiple times and I was born in December of 1977 so I couldn't have been any older than 4! I am watching it with my two girls as I type this. They are ages 10 and 8 and they are absolutely mesmerized lol.. also I'd like to point out the GREAT acting especially by Henry Thomas (Elliot). If you ever get a chance to look on YouTube, look up his original audition for this movie. It'll blow you away.. Anyway, E.T. is a timeless classic not to ever be forgotten.",10,2,2,28 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Meh....
",Guess I'm just not a huge Star Wars nerd.. this felt like a Michael Bay movie with constant action and explosions etc.. it was just ok to me.. Nothing really stood out and it'll all be forgot in my mind by next week lol.,6,2,7,23 December 2019
Predator," How could ANYBODY not like this movie?

Man of Steel," I liked it
","I liked this movie overall but it missed 3 pounts from me because of how crazy over the top it got near the end. Overall, good story and acting etc",7,5,6,18 February 2019
Aliens," Best one of the franchise!!

Pearl Harbor," Loved this movie
",I don't get why all the hate for this movie. Very memorable to me.,10,1,6,11 November 2019
Legends of the Fall," This movie moved me!
","I saw this film when I was a kid about 14 years old and a few more times when I was an adult and let me just say.. what a great film!! It has everything from romance, drama, action to thriller. It's got it all! I'm not usually a huge Brad Pitt fan but he did an AWESOME job. A lot of people said the movie was sad but to me it's more realistic.",10,3,4,30 January 2019
Batman Begins," UGH!! Sheeple, wake up!!!!
",I went to see this because of the hype just like dark knight and was so disappointed. It was boring just like dark knight and I'm NOT just a troll. Just not a sheep,2,2,15,18 February 2019
Dumb and Dumber," Classic!!
",I can't think of one bad quality about this movie. Can't say the same for the sequel unfortunately,10,3,4,18 February 2019
The Dark Knight," UGH!! Why is this movie sooooo popular and overrated?
","I know by reviewing this movie with and honest opinion, I'll upset a TON of batwagon nerds but I don't care. This movie was so boring I literally fell asleep half way through for a few minutes. I've never been a big 'batman' or comic book super hero fan but I went to see this one when it came out because of all the hype. I wasn't into Batman begins either but I figured this one would be better because of all the hype and Heath Ledgers Performanc etc.. god I was wrong. I can definitely admit that it's a very well made movie but god it was so damn boring and dull to me and NO I don't have to have tons of action like stupid transformers. I don't know, I'm not a huge Nolan fan which is weird because I know he's a good director but I usually don't like his movies. Didn't like Inception (I know right? What a weirdo) only one of his I liked was Memento and kind of liked interstellar but that one was sorta boring too. Anyway I am well aware I'm n the minority on this one but I don't care. Being honest!!",2,3,13,18 February 2019
Prometheus," Ugh, I'm not sure what I thought about this one
","Being a huge 'Alien' fan, I was a bit disappointed with this one. A lot of it didn't make sense to me. Maybe I need to rewatch a second time but it was all over the place.",5,0,1,22 February 2019
The Matrix," Ahead of its time!!
","I saw this movie at the theater in 1999. Awesome movie I'm almost every way. I recently watched it with my 10 year old daughter and she absolutely LOVED it as she is into sci fi. I cannot figure out however why it's rated R!! I feel like it should be PG-13. What's with the R rating? It's not like it had major language or violence and gore.. it had no sex or nudity either. Just unsure why was rated R but whatever, still a great movie. Can't say I remember 2 and 3 that we'll though",9,3,4,4 August 2019
Alien: Covenant," I enjoyed it!!
","Ok I know this movie had major problems and while there were things I didn't like, the movie kept my attention and I enjoyed it. Would I watch it again? Maybe if it's on at a friends house and that's what we're watching..",7,0,2,22 February 2019
