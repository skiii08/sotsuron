Lucky Number Slevin," This Film Is Nobodys Lucky Number!
","Really poor effort. Terrible direction, dialogue, acting, screenplay, wasted talent in Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman. Bruce Willis must be desperate for parts these days too. The fast editing in this film is real teenage hormone stuff, meaningless. The violence is not effective, again its all fast editing to cover up a low budget. The supporting actors are not that good but they don't need to be for this rubbish. The dialogue continues to irritate with the Chinese girl who whitters and twitters on throughout the film, even Ben Kingsley's at it. The film tries to be funny but I guarantee you won't leave the cinema hall laughing. I couldn't get out quick enough. I really don't want to say much more about this film because I'm getting bored just thinking about it. Oh yeah, should mention the meaningless James Bond homage dialogue with the Chinese girl and Slevin, whats that all about. I thought the film was trying to copy Casino and Goodfellas at first with the narrative intro, this fizzles out into a comedy film and then the film snaps into cold psycho mode at the end. Did I mention the dialogue?",2,9,23,17 March 2006
Zodiac," Would send you to sleep!
","Boring stuff. Seemed OK for about the first hour and then it just dragged on, nothing was happening, just constant dialogue between characters. The main character was like something from a kids TV show. He was OK in spiderman but rubbish in this. This film is a mish mash of ideas that don't quite gel. As with all of Fincher's movies, cinematography is good, but the script is a shambles and Fincher has got lost trying to do something he just can't do, work with a complicated script and make it an engrossing piece of work. Fincher is good with a simple premise such as The Game and Fight Club but Brian De Palma he ain't.I fell asleep half way through this film and left before the end as did a few other people. In saying that I wasn't expecting much from it because I thought Seven was rubbish also.",1,9,19,16 June 2007
Cross of Iron," The Most Realistic Depiction of the Eastern Front Ever!
","You don't need many words to describe this film. Terrific cast, terrific cinematography and a lasting image of the horrors of the Eastern Front during World War 2.This film is Sam Peckinpah's greatest film! Why? Well, the horrors of the Eastern Front really happened whereas film's like the 'Wild Bunch' were fiction. When you watch the film you get an idea of what it must have been like to endure the privations of war. More importantly this film refuses to let us forget the sacrifices made by all sides during the war.These things apart, James Coburn has played in this film the most memorable,deepest and important role of his career. Coburn's performance allows us to understand the mental torment of someone who is forced to kill for a campaign he doesn't believe in. He isn't a Nazi but forced to endure for the advancement of their cause. This is important because many war films mistakenly depict the German soldier as a committed Nazi, evil and inhuman.Maximillian Schell is a fantastic foil as the cowardly superior officer only thinking of his own advancement while all around him struggle to survive. James Mason also provides a heavyweight supporting role as the commanding officer who is straight and honest.Cross of Iron allows us to somehow visualise what must be the most mysterious and darkest aspect of the war. Conventional war is bad enough but the Eastern Front went beyond the convention.The hatred shared by both sides for each other fueled the conflict to heights of unparalleled savagery. Not even Cross of Iron will allows us to see what it was really like, but then, do we really want to?",10,0,0,22 November 2002
The Dark Knight," You Must Be Batty If You Like This Film!
","I should have listened to my instincts which were telling me that I could not take seriously a movie where a guy in a rubber halloween costume was flying around skyscrapers beating up the bad guys. At least the original by Tim Burton and Michael Keaton as Batman was a bit tongue in cheek as the TV series was but the Dark Knight took itself far too seriously and the result was embarrassing. Why does Batman have this gruff stereotypical voice? Then as his alter ego Bruce Wayne it disappears. Also, Michael Caine addressing Christian Bale as Master Wayne is also a bit laughable.Anyway, too much crash, bang, wallop for my liking. Yes, special effects were good but so was Blade Runner and that felt more atmospheric and substantial than this rubbish. Ashame, because Christopher Nolan's last film The Prestige was hugely enjoyable with great script and cinematography. Also Bale was in his element here but as Batman he was quite simply pathetic with that stupid voice.My rating is 6/10 for effects only and I wouldn't waste your hard earned on this rubbish. I think they should now let Batman rest in peace. I can't think of one which was any good, even the Tim Burton version from the 80's was about average.You must be batty if you like this film!",6,6,14,10 August 2008
Identity," You Will Feel Cheated After This!
","This 'HORROR' movie is ok for the first hour, credible acting performances all round, decent cinematography and even direction!And then something happens! It totally changes in the last 40minutes into some of the worst and disappointing cinema you will see ever. A completely ridiculous ending which leaves the audience cheated by introducing plot twists which are quite implausible. The very end says it all!One can only imaging that the filming budget was running thin near completion and they had to rush out the ending as a result.5 out of 10",5,0,1,2 August 2003
