Hereditary," Surprisingly Outstanding
","I was an hour into this movie , and I was thinking, 'Hey, it's a good movie, but it's not a horror movie.' NOPE, definitely a HORROR MOVIE, and the best parts are the twists and turns because you can't figure out, is this Satanic? Is it just this one's crazy, or that one's crazy? Is this a freakin dream? Excellent! Great production and ideas, great imagination...a nice pay attention horror piece.",10,0,3,26 December 2018
