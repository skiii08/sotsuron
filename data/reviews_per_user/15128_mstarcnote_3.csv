Despicable Me 2," A sequel nearly as good.
",This is good enough to stand alone.It builds the world of the main characters well and is a good addition to the 1st film.My 10month old son sits and watches it all the way through and I have to restart it again for him.,9,0,1,16 May 2019
Shutter Island," You can only watch it once
","This maybe the greatest movie that has 0 re-watch-ability.The story arc is awesome.
The cinematography is great.
And the acting is fantastic.DiCaprio is DiCaprio. A great actor who plays himself brilliantly.Once you have watched til the end, you can not watch it again.Don't buy this movie if you can watch it as a rent.",8,1,2,16 May 2019
Minions," Their origins don't fit with the main movies.
","The Minions motivations are shown to us early on and why they devote themselves to Gru.
However, this fly's in the face of Dispicable Me 2 and 3.The movie is full of Hollywood's who's whos and I don't know why. It's like the time George Clooney played a chicken in South Park.The film falls apart after the hour mark.It can be enjoyable. But, you need to shut your head of completely.",7,0,0,16 May 2019
