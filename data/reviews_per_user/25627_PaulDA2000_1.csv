Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny but kind of disgusting
","As a Christian, I wanted to check out this movie mainly for the 'salvation scene'in the Church. There are many Christians who don't agree with that Pentecostal style, just so people are aware of that. The Pentecostal scene wasn't that bad, as a matter of fact, many real Pentecostal/charismatic church services look like that. I did find the last scene where they are picking at Jesus (?) on the cross to be offensive. I just have to wonder if he did something similar with Mohammad, how many hundreds of thousands of Muslims would have rioted by now, as they did with those cartoons a while back. Anyway, I understand where the movie is coming from: Borat is ignorant of American customs and comes off as rude and racist, but at the same time the movie shows how racist many Americans are, as we pretend to be this 'great moral nation'. I did not care for the nude wrestling scene, nor for the scene showing Borat's son'd genitals. I did laugh at some of the jokes, my wife laughed a lot more than I did, but this is not the kind of movie that is going to help my walk with the Lord. I mean I don't mind a good comedy with a bit of shock value, but I don't need to see this type of gross out stuff to tell me that there are still racist Americans out there. I already know this.",3,5,11,20 November 2006
