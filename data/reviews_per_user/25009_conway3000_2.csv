Ford v Ferrari," Entertaining Movie
","Ford V Ferrari is an entertaining well done movie. Besides an exciting, true story, it contained the superb acting talents of Matt Damon, Christian Bale and a bevy of excellent supporting talent. The racing scenes were well choreographed and exciting. All in all a great movie from start to finish.",10,0,0,16 February 2020
Rocketman," Wow Movie
","I saw Rocketman last night and was so impressed with the movie as well as the Oscar caliber performance of Taron Egerton as Elton. I live in the US and remember vividly when Elton burst into the scene in the US. I have attended 3 Elton John concerts. One in the beginning of his career with the fancy costumes, one with Billy Joel, and last fall Elton's farewell tour. All were inspiring and wonderful. I came away from Rocketman an entertaining well done film both raving about Egerton's superb performance and realizing and respecting anew Elton John's spectacular talent as a performer and songwriter with Bernie Taupin's talent as a lyricist. I hope both the film and Egerton get recognized at Oscar time.",10,0,3,7 July 2019
