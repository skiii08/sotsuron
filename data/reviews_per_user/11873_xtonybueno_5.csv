Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A simple question never answered...
","(possible mild spoiler)My question is this:  What exactly is The Phantom Menace?  What character or event does this signify?  The title 'The Phantom Menace' could be interpreted two ways.  One seemingly implies that there would be a proposed threat which turned out to be false or insignificant.  The other is that there is indeed a very real threat, only is is unbeknownst, hidden, or veiled.  I have only one possible theory as to what this alleged menace could be - Senator (later in Empire and Jedi he'd become Emperor)Palpatine. But this character doesn't seem too significant here, so why name the movie after a secondary character?  SW: I has perhaps the strangest title for any major motion picture since A Clockwork Orange (the title of which is never, ever explained or even mentioned in that movie).WILL SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT IN THE WORLD THIS MEANS?",Null,0,1,24 June 2000
Mulan," Enjoyable movie, but I have a question...
","Mulan is yet another winning animated feature from Disney.  However, there is one question I cannot get out of my head.  Is there any material missing from the DVD that was included in the theatrical release?  I could have SWORN that at one point, Eddie Murphy's character said something like, 'You expect me to believe that this drag queen just happened to need a ride somewhere?!'  Was this omitted from home versions?  Please, someone e-mail me with the answer!",7,0,1,27 February 2000
Rules of Engagement," Highly recommended
","Rules of Engagement is a real breath of fresh air from all the mindless drivel polluting theatres nowadays.  Excels on almost every technical level (acting, writing, direction, cinematography are all top-notch) as well as providing an intelligent, thought-provoking scenario.  One really feels for the plight of Samuel Jackson's character and wonders how we might react in such a dilemma.  The same can also be said for Tommy Lee Jones' character. This movie will no doubt draw comparisons with A Few Good Men, but Rules of Engagement is a much superior film (yes, I know this is a large statement). More than anything else, this one confirms what I've known for a while - it's almost impossible to create an action/drama as well as William Friedkin when he's at his best.

The Lion King," The Lion King as political allegory
","When this first came out, I was so impressed I saw it several times.  It still remains one of my favorite movies and nearly everyone I've ever met who has seen it regards it highly.  That said, it is somewhat surprising to me that more people do not recognize that The Lion King owes about as much to Hamlet as it does Orwell's Animal Farm.  Here's why. (SPOILERS)The herd of wildebeasts utilized by Scar appear to represent mindless masses of general populace.  By themselves they are essentially harmless, but properly (or improperly) rallied, they can even succeed in overthrowing an entire government.  The hyenas who are conned into scaring them seem to stand for basic undesirable elements plaguing society today (the alluring culture of the street, corrupt law enforcement officials, possibly irresponsible journalistic practices).  The movie also makes a strong point that when these individuals are allowed to roam freely in society, inevitably the same vices plaguing their territory (elephant graveyard - perhaps alluding to the inner cities of many major cities... at least in the U.S.) will befall everyone else as well.  Note the strong resemblance of the rock formation at the end of 'Be Prepared' to skyscrapers found downtown in any large city.  For these and other reasons, it's not too much of a surprise that The Lion King was criticized for racist overtones.  Still, if you can put this aside, and haven't seen it by now, The Lion King remains the most stunning and complex films in animation history",10,0,0,2 February 2000
The Deer Hunter," Excruciatingly dull
","The Deer Hunter is hands down the worst war movie I've seen.  It's a shame that the few powerful moments and fine performances that are here are completely wasted.  Who on Earth wants to see long, boring, and totally pointless scenes of monotonous daily life amongst a bunch of uncharismatic people?  Character development is one thing.  We don't need to see two hours of beer drinking, pool shooting, and especially the extended wedding sequence if absolutely none of it is relevant and not the least bit entertaining.  By the time the film's few genuinely moving scenes do arrive, they are too little, too late.  If you haven't seen The Deer Hunter and are viewing all the positive comments here, please take what I've said into consideration.",3,17,32,24 February 2000
