Hereditary," Distressing and unpleasant
","This movie was oppressive and gloomy. I was riveted, the story and camera work were dark and foreboding. Their are hidden symbols and imagery in the film. This is the kind of movie that stays with you and has you thinking WTF. This movie left me feeling unnerved. The only other movie I have ever watched that made me feel contaminated after viewing was Old Boy (the original).",7,1,2,22 June 2019
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4 does not disappoint
","Cute and funny, just like a Toy Story movie should be. Woody goes on a wild adventure and meets some creepy dolls trying to steal something from him. Satisfying ending. Only complaint is I wish there was more Buzz in the movie.",7,0,1,29 June 2019
