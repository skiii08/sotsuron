Requiem for a Dream," found myself holding my breath...
","A visually stunning film, and at times, I caught myself holding my breath without even realizing it.Following the destruction of four people, Harry (Jared Leto), his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connolly), and his best friend Ty (Marlon Wayans), 'Requiem' conveys the downward spirals through the mise-en-scene, the scored soundtrack, fast-paced editing, and storyline parallels.You don't have to take any drugs to find this movie amazing.  Actually, if you do take anything, the movie will make you want to stop.  I can't think of another film that shows the downfalls of drug addictions so frankly and honestly as 'Requiem.'The third act climax is a non-stop, rushing ride, that comes to a crashing halt, and I found myself crying and gasping for air.  All four of the main actors are amazing, most of all Burstyn, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role.See it.  And if you've already seen it, see it again.  It gets better every time...",10,0,1,12 June 2002
