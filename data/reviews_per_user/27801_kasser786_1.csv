Sucker Punch," An unpolished Tarantino style film!
","A feeling of Quentin Taratino but without the fully polished storyline and product. Still I rate this movie highly and feel it is one you are wondering about for quite a few days afterwards. The cinematography, cgi and girls are all beautiful. The acting is excellent, of the main characters and the not so main characters. I just wish there was a bit more, I don't know where. Maybe I wanted more survivors or more punishment dealt to the evil characters.All in all very underrated movie!Enjoy!PS. I wanna see babydolls dance, which you never get to see! Is there even a dance, this film leaves me with so many questions and possibilities it gets slightly frustrating!",Null,4,7,17 June 2011
