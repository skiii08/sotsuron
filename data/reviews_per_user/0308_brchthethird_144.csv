Vertigo," For me, the perfect Hitchcock film
","I like to be in a good frame of mind when starting a film, because if distracted, it will affect the way I process it. So, after a few false starts, I finally have seen VERTIGO, and what I feel to be the perfect example of a Hitchcock film. The story follows John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired San Francisco detective who is called by a friend to follow his wife. Along the way, he falls in love and has some curious experiences revolving around mistaken identity and his fear of heights. Dare I say that James Stewart hasn't been better (at least in a Hitchcock film) than here. Kim Novak also acquits herself rather nicely in the typical Hitchcock blonde role, although I still think Grace Kelly is a slightly better actress. All of Hitchcock's tricks are put to full use here, and things start off brilliantly with my favorite title sequence so far. Saul Bass and Bernard Herrmann were two of Hitch's greatest collaborators, and they certainly did some of their best work here. From a story perspective, the narrative takes a number of twists and turns which a discerning viewer will probably figure out beforehand, but its the execution of said twists that really make them work. They aren't telegraphed, but rather are hinted at or suggested. And if there's anything that makes a Hitchcock film extremely watchable, is how he is able to manipulate audience expectations through the power of suggestion. From a technical perspective, there was quite a bit of impressive camera-work and photographic effects that add to a sense of disorientation and suspense. In particular, there are a few zoom in/track out shots that visually illustrate James Stewart's character's acrophobia. There was also a really trippy dream sequence that served as a nice reprise of the opening title sequence. Even the production design, sets, costumes, etc. added to the visual splendor. Even when the narrative slows down (to ease the tension), there's always something beautiful to look at, be it a person or one of the many on-location shots of downtown San Francisco. And finally, Bernard Herrmann's score was pretty much perfect, helping to build tension at the right moments and backing off when necessary. A couple key moments in the film happen sans score, and the mark of a good composer is knowing which moments to back off and let the drama speak for itself. Put together, all of the various production elements form a package which, to me, is the epitome of what Hitchcock brought to cinema. You have interesting (and attractive) characters, a suspense-filled story, brilliant camera-work and a rapturous score. Even the ending this time felt better than in his other films. Although it would probably benefit someone new to Hitchcock to start with something earlier in his filmography (to get a sense of progression), VERTIGO is probably the pinnacle of his style and certainly essential when it comes to film classics.",10,5,7,10 August 2015
The New World," A slow and contemplative meditation
","For my second Terrence Malick film (and there aren't too many), I have chosen THE NEW WORLD. It's basically the story of Pocahontas, starting from the settlement of Jamestown when she met John Smith to her later life when she married John Rolfe and moved to England. Of course, being that this is Terrence Malick, the minutiae of historical details aren't really adhered to and the story is told in rather broad strokes, making sure to hit all of the important historical moments but generally being a slower and more contemplative meditation on the themes that its director is interested in. While I was perfectly fine with the abstract story in THE TREE OF LIFE, I felt that it didn't quite work as well here. Still, Malick has crafted a stunningly beautiful film that explores themes of discovery, conflict, the search for happiness, and making the most out of difficult situations. What I thought worked very well was a restrained use of voice-over that served as internal monologues. Absent a lot of dialogue, this provided an essential window into the various characters. I also loved the numerous shots of natural beauty which were expertly captured by Malick's frequent cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski. As far as acting is concerned, everyone gave a really good performance, although the cast was subordinate to the imagery. The score was also excellent, and in particular I liked the simple piano theme that played when John Smith and Pocahontas were on screen together. However, despite all of this really positive stuff I do think that the film dragged a bit in places and I found my mind wandering somewhat. I suppose it would have helped if this wasn't a story based in historical fact. That way I wouldn't have had expectations about how it should have been presented. Honestly, I would have a preferred a more straightforward telling, but what I got wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. Overall, this is a technically superb film that has some interesting observations on life, but it did subvert my expectations a little bit.",7,1,2,12 January 2015
Walk the Line," Succeeds largely due to its two powerful central performances and some awesome music
","Even though I'm not really a country music fan and have only ever listened to Johnny Cash in passing, WALK THE LINE is still one of the best musical biopics I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have great chemistry on screen that helps to sell the lifelong friendship and later, romance, that developed between Johnny and June Carter Cash. They also chose a good period of Cash's life to focus on that helps to establish a perfect narrative arc and deliver one of the best happy endings I've ever seen. Still, the road to that happy ending isn't easy. Johnny Cash wasn't the nicest person in the world and it really wore on my patience to see him making the same mistakes over and over again. But beneath it all, there was an admirable persistence that came through despite him being so unlikeable for so much of the film. The film also features some great toe-tapping music with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon actually lending their voices to the timeless tunes. And again, it's partially this element which makes their portrayal of these people so good. The only issue I took with the film is that it was a little too long. After several times of Johnny Cash messing up with drugs and alcohol I got the point, so some of the later sequences bordered on overkill. Going into the film you already know how it will turn out and forgive me if I want to get to the happy ending a little quicker. There were also some genre clichés that are a little bit more noticeable now that a lot of these types of films (and parodies of those films) exist. But despite all of that, I can forgive these 'sins' for the music and crowd-pleasing resolution to the story. Overall, WALK THE LINE is able to mostly transcend its clichés through its earnest and heartfelt execution. If you're a fan of good music and good films, you should enjoy this.",8,0,0,26 March 2015
Miracle," An effective inspirational sports drama
","Sports aren't really my thing, but every once in a while I enjoy watching a sports movie. This one in particular is a great one despite following Disney's formula almost to the letter. Often, it's not the ideas in a movie that make the difference, but their execution, and that couldn't be more true here. MIRACLE is the story of how the USA came from behind to defeat the USSR in the 1980 Winter Olympics. I already knew how things would end, but for me that didn't matter. It was great to see fantastic performances from the entire cast and the development of a diverse group of individuals into a cohesive team under the leadership and guidance of Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell). It gets off to a bit of a slow start, but once the focus shifts from team-building to the excitement of playing hockey things really took off. The only thing that kind of drags the film down is a subplot involving a conflict between Herb Brooks and his wife (Patricia Clarkson), but mainly for pacing reasons. I still thought it added depth to Herb's character overall. I should also give props to the soaring musical score which effectively sell the emotional highs. When all is said and done, this is a great film that speaks to America's strength in times of adversity. I'm not one to buy the myth of American exceptionalism hook, line and sinker, but I do acknowledge that we need inspiration from time to time and this film definitely delivers it. Highly recommended for sports fans, or people who like inspirational films.",7,0,0,18 October 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Mildly enjoyable in a 'so bad it's good' way
","At this point it is futile to quibble about the lack of character development, wooden acting and cliché dialogue. This doesn't make me some 'Twi-hard', but I did find some enjoyment in this installment due to the utter ludicrousness of the plot and some truly hilarious moments. The first 30 minutes concerns itself with Edward and Bella's nuptials, and this was probably the worst part of the whole movie due to some extremely cringe-inducing, cliché-ridden dialogue. However, after that we get treated to the honeymoon which explores (in a chaste, PG-13 way) what it would be like for a vampire to have sex with a human. They don't just bang the headboard, they break the entire bed (technically, Edward does but whatever). Then, what follows is one of the most inexplicable pregnancies since the Virgin Birth, and seems to making a case against abortion. Admirable, but misguided. Anyway, the conflict that ensues over this vampire baby makes for some of the more melodramatic moments in the film. Obviously not competently handled, but interesting enough to watch unfold. However, the way in which it is resolved is head-scratchingly bizarre, yet completely expected if you've been paying attention before. I think that the only creepier thing than Edward grooming Bella for vampire-dom is Jacob imprinting on Renesmee, who is literally a baby. It couldn't get any more pedophilic than that, in my opinion. And somehow, because of the immutable werewolf law this solves the problem. Ridiculous, but kind of funny still. There's also a cheeky, yet ominous mid-credits scene which sets up the inevitable finale to come (but didn't Bella's eyes opening again already do that?). Anyway, the filmmaking quality here is the best yet in the series, with excellent cinematography and visual style to spare. Overall it's less awkward and overly 'teenage' than its predecessors, probably due to the maturing of the subject matter. Flawed, but enjoyable enough for fans of the series.",6,3,7,13 November 2014
The Equalizer," Denzel Washington plays another badass, so what's not to love?
","Directed by Antoine Fuqua and based on a 1980's TV show (which I haven't seen), THE EQUALIZER stars Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, a quiet man with a murky past who has a keen sense of justice and helps those in need. While this film could have been a pulpy, ultra-violent mess, the team of Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington (who previously collaborated on TRAINING DAY) bring a sense of realism and attention to character that elevate this above your typical revenge action picture. As the title character, Denzel Washington brings gravitas and his usual 'coolness' to the role of Robert McCall. He's a man of few words, and also one who is methodical and precise. He also has a good sense of right and wrong, which is why he does what he does, and not just in a violent way. He's a very friendly man who helps his friends and co-workers in other ways as well, i.e., training a fellow Home Mart employee for a security guard exam. One thing I really liked was the way in which you could tell what he was thinking by him just giving a look, and in fact, we are introduced to him in a largely wordless opening sequence. The film also stars Chloe Grace Moretz as Ilina/Teri, an underage Russian prostitute. While she did a great job portraying her character, she was little more than a plot device that springs McCall into action. I should also mention Marton Czokas as Teddy, a Russian heavy who is brought in to investigate after McCall kills several Russian pimps in retaliation for putting Ilina in the hospital (of course, after offering them a way out). He was the only other character besides McCall who really had any depth, and he brought a certain lethality and sadism to his character which contrasted nicely with McCall. Other than him, all of the villains were expendable and generic, which is unfortunate considering the quality filmmaking here. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo also appeared in glorified cameos as a friendly couple tied to McCall's mysterious past. They weren't anything special, but it was nice to see them in the film. Regarding McCall's past, though, they don't really go into much detail but it wasn't too much of a big deal because it contributed to his overall mystique and kept the focus on his everyman persona. As far as the action and technical side of the film, it was well-staged and shot, and it looked like Denzel did most of his own stunts. The fights were up close and intimate, but it was still possible to tell what was going on from shot to shot as well as having a good sense of geography. However, for the most part, the violence was restrained and brutally efficient instead of lingering on it in a gratuitous way, which was true to the character of McCall. Overall, despite not delving too deeply into any of the characters but McCall, THE EQUALIZER is a good examination of a down-to-earth hero who does what he feels is right in order to level the playing field for those who are unable to help themselves. There's also a nice sub-message about being who you want to be in life and not letting others dictate that for you. It's one of the best action movies in a while, and a great re-teaming of Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington, who appears here in top form.",8,0,3,20 January 2015
The Young Victoria," The perils and pitfalls of being a young monarch
","One of the pitfalls that a lot of biopics fall into is that they try to do too much, e.g., telling someone's entire life story as opposed to a part of it. Thankfully, THE YOUNG VICTORIA avoids this mistake by choosing to focus on the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. The source of dramatic conflict is how, as a young monarch, she was pulled this way and that by advisors and politicians who were all vying for control and influence. Meanwhile, she finds a friend (and eventually, lover) in Prince Albert. One thing the film does really well is show the difficulty inherent in being a leader, especially when one is young and viewed as inexperienced. Emily Blunt pulls off the role admirably and shows the chops she would bring to later performances such as EDGE OF TOMORROW, although her character here is a little more vulnerable. I thought she showed both sides quite well. Rupert Friend also did a great job as Prince Albert, who provided much needed solace and counterpoint to Victoria. Mark Strong also did well as the slimy John Conroy, who pressured Victoria to establish a regency with her mother, the Duchess of Kent. Also worth noting is the excellent production design and costumes which faithfully (I assume) and beautifully reproduce Victorian England. There is also an incredible score and soundtrack with (mostly) period classical music. Put together, this creates a rather handsome period costume drama and romance that should appeal to a large swath of the movie-going public.",9,3,3,20 March 2015
Child 44," 'In a time of universal deceit, speaking the truth is a revolutionary act'
","Directed by Daniel Espinosa (SAFE HOUSE), and starring Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace (among others), CHILD 44 tells the story of one man's effort to bring a serial child murderer to justice in a society where the mere existence of murder is denied. The society in question was Soviet Russia, ca. 1953, and the existence of such evil things was basically unthinkable/untenable in what was ostensibly a 'worker's paradise.' In a general sense, based on the lackluster reception from both audiences and critics, I wasn't expecting too much from this. I didn't too much care for Daniel Espinosa's previous film, SAFE HOUSE, but he does have a gritty style that I appreciate. What interested me more was the incredible cast he assembled for what I thought was going to be a rather simple, if protracted (at 137 minutes), crime procedural. What I got actually spent more time on the human drama, which I didn't mind at all, although more time could have been spent on moving the plot forward in what was a film with a rather languid pace. I also took some issue initially with a non-Russian cast putting on their best Russian accents. Some do better than others (Noomi Rapace, in particular), but for the most part I got used it and it never really bothered me after about 20-30 minutes. What the film does really well is examine Soviet Russian society in the 1950's, with all of the paranoia, backstabbing and low standard of living for the common person. In that respect, the milieu the film portrays and the way in which it is portrayed create an atmosphere that all but chokes out any sense of justice or hope. That's what makes the central characters' journey so compelling, aside from being well-written. You feel for them because the odds are not in their favor, and yet they continue to pursue a goal that puts their lives at risk. Also, in a more general sense the film explores the degree to which people will lie to themselves and others in order to avoid an inconvenient truth. When looked at from this perspective, the quote which opens the film ('There is no murder in paradise') becomes, not a statement of fact, but a mantra repeated to stave off the knowledge that the world we live in is anything but a paradise. Although the film does take its time getting into gear, the journey it takes you on is well worth the wait and, despite the downbeat tone, it does have a fitting ending. Also, to the film's credit there were a few moments of violence that made me flinch. With the way movie audiences have become desensitized to violence, it was refreshing to have a film where it serves a purpose and has real impact. Overall, this isn't really a film that I'd soon watch again (due to the depressing subject matter), but is something that should be seen by more than have already. Don't believe the negative buzz and just give it a try.",7,1,6,13 September 2015
Casablanca," Timeless - a Hollywood classic!
","This was yet another classic film to which I've been a 'Johnny-come-lately.' Still, I can see why it has attained its status as one of the Hollywood greats. Put simply, it deals with timeless themes in a matter-of-fact way, enhanced by the excellent performances, flawless and elegant cinematography and an emotionally stirring soundtrack and score. There's not a single minute wasted, and its impossible not to get caught up in the story of love, longing and triumph over adversity. Any self-respecting film lover owes it to themselves to see this, and preferably more than once. At least now I can check it off my cinematic bucket list.",10,3,4,14 November 2014
John Wick," Ruthlessly efficient action that still left me wanting
","Word-of-mouth can be very useful in gauging if a film is worth seeing or not, but it can also lead to erroneous expectations. I went into this thinking it would be this absolutely awesome action romp, and to a degree that's true. I just thought it would also be a little more fun. JOHN WICK is by no means a bad film, but one that seems satisfied with a cool soundtrack and brutal, well-choreographed action while having a rather weak foundation of a story. The setup is that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who gets dragged back into the life after a Russian gangster's upstart son foolishly steals his car and murders his dog. That's it. I wasn't expecting anything deep, mind you, but I would have liked a little more complexity and intrigue. It was straight-forward almost to the point of being boring at times, and without a lot of the production and character design that fleshed out something like MAD MAX FURY ROAD, or the manic humor of KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE. To the film's credit, the action goes against the current trend of flashy camera-work and tricky editing, so one is able to comprehend and appreciate the brutality and choreography. And even though a lot of it takes place at night, geography is never in question and you can tell where people are in relation to each other. These elements were also well-supported by some good special effects, bullet hits, etc. In terms of the world of the film, there were a few nice touches that hinted at a complex criminal underworld, one where assassins have their own hotel and criminals use their own currency. The film was also well-acted for the most part, despite the characters being so shallow apart from Keanu Reeves' John Wick. To me, the film largely wasted talented actors like Ian McShane, Michael Nyqvist and Willem Dafoe by not really giving them anything fun or interesting to do. When it comes down to it, all the film really has is Keanu Reeves' charisma and some admittedly good action, and that wasn't really enough for me. Bringing this back full-circle, expectations can make or break a film and I think I went into this expecting a little too much. For the die-hard action fan who doesn't really care how much story goes along the beatings and bullets, JOHN WICK will do just fine. For those who expect a little more from a film, there's plenty of others to choose from.",6,1,5,25 July 2015
Gravity," Technically impressive, but not much more
","2001 it is not, but GRAVITY is a tense and, at times, thrilling movie about survival that coasts on its stunning visuals while paying little attention to story and character. The plot is simple: two astronauts who are making modifications to the Hubble Space Telescope have to fight for their lives after debris from a Russian satellite starts to make its way towards them. The cast is quite small, and only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney have any screen time. Everyone else is just a voice on the intercom. George Clooney does his usual ladies' man routine, which he does quite well, and Sandra Bullock does a good job of a woman who never should have been allowed in space in the first place. That aside, they do an admirable job with the script they were given. Where the movie really excels is in the visual department. Alfonso Cuaron spent many years developing this concept and technology to make this movie, not unlike James Cameron did with Avatar, and it shows on screen. These are some of the most impressive space effects that I've seen in a long time, although calling them ground-breaking might be giving it a little too much credit. The score is also worth mentioning, and helps to maintain the tension throughout the film. Still, I felt like the story was lacking enough, and the middle 45-50 minutes of the movie lags quite a bit. I have a feeling that I'd be looking at this movie differently had I saw it in theaters, but I didn't, so this is how I feel about it. The first half-hour, and the last 20 minutes were superb, but the middle dragged a little too much. Overall, it is a movie worth seeing, although to get the full effect of the visuals, it would probably be best to see this on the largest screen possible and with a decent sound system. Best movie of 2013? No, but it's still pretty good for what it is.",6,1,2,14 November 2014
Lone Survivor," A realistic depiction of modern combat, with a little flag-waving on the side
","LONE SURVIVOR is an incredible experience: a tale of bravery and camaraderie, and one of the most realistic depictions of war that I've ever seen. The story is about Operation Red Wings and takes place during the (still-ongoing) Afghanistan War. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, a Navy Seal Petty Officer who was the lone survivor of the mission. Early on, the movie establishes the characters and gives the audience a sense of who they are, although it doesn't really delve too much. However, it gives enough of a baseline so that when the fighting ensues you care when they're injured and killed. If there was one area where the movie doesn't quite stand up to scrutiny, it's that they could have had some more character development. Still, that's not quite the reason for this movie. It's mostly about the intense firefight that Luttrell and his three other team members enter into when their op is compromised. And it sure was intense and brutal. It was filmed in a way to maximize the visceral nature of the experience and, while occasionally chaotic, was still comprehensible. There was also a lot of well-done special effects with injuries, kill-shots, etc. Here, the filmmakers did a great job putting you in the moment and making you feel the pain these soldiers went through. Overall, I liked the movie which, while never questioning American involvement in the region, does differentiate between friendly Afghanis and the Taliban. There was a touching moment towards the end between Luttrell and a young Afghani boy that was quite moving. Also, before the end credits they have a slide show of the actual people involved in the operation, which I thought was a fitting tribute to their sacrifice. Is it the greatest war movie ever? No, but it is very effective at what it sets out to do, and I applaud it for that.",8,0,1,14 November 2014
Fury," Impressive-looking and well-staged while lacking in emotional impact
","So many war films have been made that it's very hard to create something new or original anymore, at least as far as the drama and story is concerned. David Ayer's gritty, realistic style is pretty much a perfect fit for this type of film, but it was lacking in rich characters and emotional heft (at least to me). The story is about a Sherman tank crew during the final days of WWII who must face overwhelming odds to survive. You have Brad Pitt as the chief, Michael Pena as the driver, Jon Bernthal as the loader, Shia LeBeouf as the gunner, and Logan Lerman as a doe-faced replacement who must overcome his reluctance to fight and kill. I don't think you could have a more stereotypical group of people in a war film. Brad Pitt seems to be playing a more grounded, stoic version of his character from INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, while Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal barely register as little more than caricatures of people. Shia LeBeouf actually acquitted himself rather nicely as a Bible-quoting soldier, which at least distinguished him somewhat from the rest. Logan Lerman, as a conduit for the audience, has a good character arc although it's one we've seen dozens of times before. From a writing perspective, FURY settles for 'been there, done that' and it suffers as a result. However, David Ayer knows his way around action and the various battle sequences were pretty awesome. I don't think I've seen a war film centered around tank warfare, so at least that was new to me. The violence was gritty and realistic, but not overly graphic. I also thought that the color palate and cinematography helped to create a very distinctive mood and atmosphere, helped along by the often melancholy score. Aside from this, there was a respite from the violence in the middle where Logan Lerman's and Brad Pitt's characters get some development as they temporarily shack up in a house with two German girls. This segment of the film had my favorite part, which is when Logan Lerman plays a song on the piano and one of the girls starts singing along. It was the sweetest moment in an otherwise rather dark film. Thematically, I think the film was often at odds with itself. It wants you to see the protagonists as heroes, yet other than the fact that they're fighting for what we already know is the winning side, little they do would suggest that they are heroic. I'd also be hard-pressed to call any of the characters 'complex.' When it comes down to it, FURY is a rather simple war film that has visceral action and intense visuals. It should do fine for the average film-goer, but I was left wanting a little more.",6,0,6,19 July 2015
Akira," Stunning visuals and a cool story make for quite a unique experience
","Anime has never been something I felt drawn to, yet there are many titles to which aficionados of the genre/style will always point you and which have achieved a sort of name recognition among those who wouldn't necessarily consider themselves fans. AKIRA is one of those films, and it happens to be the first anime film I've ever seen. The setting is 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, so named because of an apocalyptic event which took place 31 years earlier. The rebuilt city isn't too different from what you might find in a post-apocalyptic/dystopian sci-fi story. What stood out most to me, and the most recognizable elements of this type of story, was the portrayal of a fascist police state where government and those in authority abuse their power and the citizens fight against them. Not only do they show this violence, but there is also a lot of graffiti which provides subtext and context to the overall situation. Some of it went over my head because it's probably specific to Japanese society when this film (and the source graphic novel) were made, but the broad strokes of oppressive regimes, the military-industrial complex and populist uprisings should resonate with most viewers. All of this, and I haven't even gotten to what makes this story unique. At the center of this story is a biker gang, and one of the members, Tetsuo, is captured by a secret military group that studies people with psychic abilities. There is also another group of people who prophecy about the return of some mystical Akira, who will either bring balance or destruction. To be honest, I don't completely understand all of the plot intricacies, but most of the time I was being blown away by the stunning hand-drawn animation. I've never completely warmed up to computer animation, but animated films such as this one have an artistry to them that is second to none (when done right). One minor complaint I have is that the English dub (and I don't really like dubs) was a bit iffy in places. What I mean by that is some of the voice acting was a bit over-the-top. Still, it wasn't too distracting like it might be in a live-action film. My other minor complaint has to do with the length of the film. The third act was perhaps a little bit too protracted and it messed with the overall pacing. Still, I ended up liking this film a lot and look forward to delving into more anime in the future.",8,3,5,28 February 2015
Citizen Kane," Classic Hollywood at its finest
","CITIZEN KANE is one of those films that often makes critics' top ten lists of the greatest films ever made, and has built quite a reputation as such over the 70+ years since it was released. It's also one of those films that people might be familiar with, but may not have seen. And until now, I hadn't actually seen it myself. So, does it live up to its reputation? Yes, it mostly does. The story, if somebody out there doesn't know, is about Charles Foster Kane, who is taken from his parents at a young age to live with a powerful businessman and, once he comes of age, takes over control of a newspaper. Over the course of his life, which is recounted almost entirely in flashback, you see a transition from an idealistic, principled young man to a reclusive shell of his former self. I thought it was a very well-written, well-shot film that gives a very balanced portrayal of a polarizing figure. All of the performances were excellent, especially Orson Welles, who was the brainchild behind this film. I also took notice of the incredible camera-work and cinematography which made effective use of light, shadow and space as well as some really sharp camera angles which provide visual insight into power dynamics that are an integral part of the story. However the most important aspect seems to have been a man who desperately wants love and approval, but doesn't know how to get it except by trying to buy it. It is this single part of Kane that makes him a compelling character, despite being such an enigma otherwise. There was also the film's central nagging question of what his final word, 'rosebud,' meant. I thought that the answer, which is revealed in the film's final moments, was a bit underwhelming but extremely effective as a narrative-driving device. Overall, this is a classic film that deserves to be seen by all, if for no other reason than that it is an important part of film history.",10,4,6,15 February 2015
The Hunger Games," Watered-down 'Battle Royale'
","While the film is competently acted, almost everything else about it is atrocious. Since I haven't read the novels, I can't speak to the faithfulness in comparison with the source material, but for a book that supposed to be rather violent, the movie was very tame. My biggest complaint would be the shaky-camera work, which, while useful in creating a sense of intensity or confusion, is quite headache-inducing and more importantly, obscures the action. Among the positives were Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson, who I felt gave rather entertaining performances, and the lighter, more humorous bits of the film were more enjoyable to watch. In regards to the preparation for the Games, I take issue with the backdrop of the whole affair, as it reeks of so-called 'reality' TV, which I despise. But overall, I felt like this movie was like a watered-down rip-off of Battle Royale, without half of the emotional depth and pretty much none of the visceral content.",5,23,31,14 November 2014
Shaun of the Dead," Solid first feature from Pegg, Frost and Wright
","SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a smart, funny homage to zombie movies while also maintaining its own identity instead of relying entirely on genre clichés. This film marked the first theatrical collaboration between Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright and is a mostly solid affair. The performances and directing are all handled well, but it wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as I was expecting. Maybe it's because British humor isn't something I 100% get. Still, I thought that the gore was well-done, tension was kept up and the characters were all likable enough that I cared what happened to them. For me, the best moments were the quieter situational humor rather than the gory kills that one would expect from such a horror-comedy. Overall, it's one of the better horror-comedies to come out in the last 10 years and should provide enough thrills and laughs for genre fans.",7,0,2,14 November 2014
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Oh, what a tangled web we weave...
","In real life, love can be messy and irrational, but in the end it's still worth fighting for. At its heart, I believe that is the message that this film tries, and mostly succeeds, at conveying. Romantic comedies have never really been my cup of tea, but few have managed to keep me rapt like this one managed to do. This film was filled with lifelike characters told a compelling, relatable story that, while messy and overstuffed at times, still wrangled the many threads and brought them together in an interesting and completely unexpected way.The story is centered around Cal Weaver (Steve Carell, playing his usual schlubb character), whose wife just asked him for a divorce. Completely blindsided by this development, he descends into self-pity, starts frequenting bars and venting out loud to anyone within earshot. This desperation eventually attracts the attention of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a suave ladies' man who helps Cal recapture his manhood and sense of self. This leads to all sorts of misadventures and awkward situations, but where the story ends up is both expected and unexpected at the same time. Rounding out the cast is Julianne Moore as Cal's wife Emily, Kevin Bacon as the man who Emily cheats on her husband with, John Carroll Lynch as a family friend and Emma Stone as Hannah, an up-and-coming lawyer who gets involved with Jacob. Despite having such a large cast, they do end up spending enough time with each character, although the movie's pacing suffers at times and ends up feeling a little disjointed. They all give great, naturalistic performances, even the younger actors. On a more technical note, the film was well-shot, even though comedies tend not to have distinctive filming styles or cinematography. The eclectic soundtrack is also worth mentioning, even though a few cuts were a little too 'on-the-nose.' Stepping back a little bit, at first the movie felt like it was trying to accomplish too much. It starts off where a lot of movies start to end, so I thought to myself where it could possibly go from there. The answer is pretty far. It took a rather labored premise and did something fresh with it, and the chemistry and likability of the cast only made things that much better. My feelings might have been mixed towards the beginning, but as the film progressed I only grew to appreciate it more. Sure, it might not quite live up to its title, but it put forth such a great effort that I have to applaud it for that. It's proof that there is some life in the romantic comedy genre yet. I highly encourage you to see this, if only for the pleasure of seeing its incredible cast at work, but hopefully also for the intimate and honest exploration of love and the human condition.",8,0,1,14 November 2014
The Babadook," More than just a great horror film - One of this year's best
","Once in a while, there's a film you see that manages to subvert all your expectations and turns out to be something completely different, something better and deeper. THE BABADOOK is one of those films. I'd actually been aware of it for several months before finally getting the chance to see it, occasionally visiting its IMDb page and seeing glowing reviews come in from everyone who I follow. Now having watched it twice, I think I understand what's going on, and without a doubt it is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. More than just having a creepy atmosphere and some jump scares, it explores deep emotional themes in a highly metaphorical and truly unsettling way.Without giving too much away, the basic story is about a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her child (Noah Wiseman), Samuel. Samuel is a rather difficult child, and Amelia is doing her best to raise him. One night, after waking up from a nightmare, Samuel picks a book for his mother to read to him: The Babadook. After this, strange things start to happen and they begin to sense a sinister presence with them in the house.Now, earlier I said that it explores emotional themes. One in particular is that of grief and the loss of a loved one. Again, doing my best not to get into spoiler territory, this is key to understanding what happens in the film. I thought Essie Davis did a remarkable job as a mother who is plagued by grief and her emotional range in this film was amazing. Noah Wiseman also does a great job, especially for a child actor, as her son. At first, he's very bratty and unlikeable, but he gradually changes over the course of the film and you begin to understand him more as a character and a person. The supporting characters aren't as developed, but they merely provide a basis for how to view the events that transpire and as a conduit for the audience.As far as horror films go, you could come away wondering what the big deal was, but then you'd have missed the point entirely. There are some typical horror movie scares and tropes, but all of that is window-dressing for the psychological horror that lies at the core. There is a creature, but it's only used and shown as much as needed. Also, in contrast to most horror movies these days, every effect was achieved practically or in-camera, quite the necessity for a low-budget film like this. I can't really think of anything bad to say. The only thing I'll caution is to go into this with an open mind, and to expect something a little more subtle than you might be used to. Other than that, I can't recommend this highly enough. Not just one of the best horror movies this year, but one of the best, period.",10,11,23,16 December 2014
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Quite a funny satirical musical for a non-fan of SOUTH PARK
","I've never been much of a SOUTH PARK fan, mostly because the same-y voices get on my nerves and the animation style isn't that aesthetically pleasing. Still, the send-up of America's morbid, puritan obsession with 'smut' and 'profanity' in pop culture while ignoring violence was funny and relevant. It also doesn't hurt that there are a number of hilarious songs. A lot of the humor had me scratching my head, or was mildly shocking for its audacity. However, none of it was less than interesting. This doesn't necessarily make me want to go back and catch up on 19 seasons of episodes, but maybe I'll go check out a few.",7,0,1,15 September 2016
The Great Dictator," One of the greats delivers his definitive cinematic statement
","THE GREAT DICTATOR is a cinematic masterpiece with equal doses of vaudevillian humor and poignant drama. It is the story of Adenoid Hynkel and a Jewish barber. One aspires to take over the world, while the other just wants to live his life free of oppression. It is to Charlie Chaplin's credit that this film is able to speak to the human heart in such a moving way, which is what it's all about. Charlie Chaplin gives two excellent performances as the dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, and a Jewish barber. Both roles give him an opportunity to display the physical comedy which he was already so famous for. He also gets a lot of laughs by ranting in pseudo-German. The rest of the cast also do well in their roles, particularly the actor who played Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Mussolini). There was also some great cinematography and set design. The only minor thing I felt was wrong was the opening sequence, which I felt dragged on a little too long. Still, it was a nice throwback to Chaplin's previous silent movies and had some nice sight gags (really, there was quite a number of hilarious sight gags throughout). Overall, this should be seen by any self-respecting movie-lover, if only for the impassioned speech at the end, which ranks as one of the greatest movie speeches I've ever witnessed.",9,3,6,14 November 2014
Hot Fuzz," A sharp action movie parody with plenty of laughs
","In this second theatrical collaboration between Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright, they take on the buddy cop movie and deliver another slick, funny parody. Simon Pegg is Nicholas Angel, a good cop who is too good, in fact. So good that he is sent to the sleepy village of Sandford, because he was making his fellow Met cops look bad by comparison. While there, he stumbles on a conspiracy and sets out to stop it by any means necessary. One thing this movie definitely had going in its favor was that I enjoy action movies a lot more than horror movies. That's not to say I disliked SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but I like the action genre more. Like its predecessor, HOT FUZZ deals with genre clichés in a fun way while never exclusively relying on them to mine laughs. There was also a lot of references to other action movies that I thought were hilarious. And speaking of humor, I felt that this film was a significant improvement in terms of comedic writing from SHAUN OF THE DEAD. There was the more subtle British humor, which I am warming up to, and the more up-front genre-derived humor. Both work extremely well, and all of the actors deliver it perfectly. The only quibble I have with this film, though, is that it's about 10-15 minutes too long. This is mostly due to the ending, which feels like it could have ended at a couple spots, but then kept on going. What was there was funny enough, but in my opinion it could have been shortened a bit. Overall, HOT FUZZ is an improvement over SHAUN OF THE DEAD and delivers a hilarious action movie parody that genre fans will enjoy.",9,0,0,14 November 2014
Dead Poets Society," A marvelously inspiring story with one of Robin Williams' best performances
","DEAD POETS SOCIETY is an incredibly moving film by Peter Weir about life at a boys prep school. It stars Robin Williams as John Keating, an English teacher, with Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke as two of the core group of students. I went into this film knowing a little about the plot from various clips on the internet, e.g., the famous 'Oh captain, my captain' line. I was also aware about the fate of a character, although I didn't know which one until watching it. I was generally very impressed with the film, and Robin Williams' performance in particular. The story is one that had the potential to be very clichéd and overly sentimental, but the themes discussed within were approached earnestly and backed up with some great performances. Robin Williams is especially great as the English teacher, whose unique worldview (at least in the stodgy prep school environment) and unconventional teaching methods inspire the boys to make the most of their lives and dare to break the mold. The film follows several of these boys who are inspired to 'seize the day' in various ways. Robert Sean Leonard's character pursues his dream of acting and another character, Knox Overstreet, pursues a girl that he loves despite the threat of her boyfriend finding out. Together, the boys bring back a poetry reading group originally started by Keating, called the 'Dead Poets Society' (hence, the title of the film). This wasn't actually the point of the film, but more of a jumping-off point. The wonder of the film is to see how the boys develop and change for the better under Keating's influence. I can't say enough how much I loved the message. That being said, there are a couple of areas worth talking about which aren't as great. One of them is that given the large cast of characters, more time could have been spent developing them, although what's there was adequate. There is also a climactic scene which, while still handled tastefully, felt a little emotionally manipulative. Overall, this has to be the best of Robin Williams' dramatic roles that I've seen so far. It's an engaging, thought-provoking and moving film about making the most of your life, even if the setting is a bit overused. Highly recommended.",8,0,0,13 November 2014
Brokeback Mountain," A touching and tragic love story
","For the longest time I've avoided watching this film because of its status as 'that gay cowboy movie.' At some point I probably had some aversion to the subject matter, but now having put that aside I must say that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a touching, almost heartbreaking portrait of friendship and love. The cast is lead by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist, respectively. One summer, in 1963, they both work as ranch hands on Brokeback Mountain and in their isolation they develop a romantic relationship which continues for the next 20 years. Of course, this is at a point in history when homosexuality wasn't tolerated, by and large, so the two of them have to keep their relationship a secret. Both of them even get married and have children, but still manage to 'go fishing' a few times a year. Still, Ennis and Jack are quite different people. Jack is more open about his desire to settle down, while Ennis is more conflicted (and, for the time, pragmatic). While a lot of films that deal with homosexuality and gay themes often focus on the hardships and self-loathing, this one doesn't. And as a period piece, a love story between two 'out and proud' men wasn't really an option to begin with. I also liked how the material wasn't sensationalized by being too explicit. There's a couple of gay sex scenes, but the film mostly focuses on the two characters and their developing relationship. I should also mention the supporting cast, a few of whom I was surprised to see (but not in a bad way). There was Randy Quaid as J. Aguirre, the manager of the ranch that Ennis and Jack work for that summer in 1963. He only had a few scenes, but he did a really good job with his limited screen time. There was also Anne Hathaway as Laureen, the woman who Jack ends up marrying, Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife, Anna Faris, and Kate Mara as the grown-up version of Ennis' eldest daughter. Since the film is mainly about Ennis and Jack, the supporting cast doesn't get as much to do, but it was so well-written and acted that it was OK. Also worthy of mention is the beautiful cinematography and gentle score which complement the story quite nicely. The only fault I can find is that the film goes on for a little too long, like they weren't sure how to wrap it up. Still, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a warm, poignant love story that should speak to you no matter what your sexual orientation is. Just put aside your preconceived notions and give it a try if you haven't already.",8,0,0,24 March 2015
Spotlight," A compelling and sobering portrait of investigative journalism
","Did SPOTLIGHT deserve to win Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards? Maybe, I guess. I still haven't seen all of the nominees yet, but even still I recognize that SPOTLIGHT is an excellent film. Based on true events, it tells how the Boston Globe broke the story about a massive cover-up of pedophile priests in the Catholic Church. It also features an incredible ensemble cast who, although not given much to do individually, work great together in service of a very compelling (and saddening) story. Out of the five actors given top billing, I would say that Liev Schreiber and Mark Ruffalo fare the best, although the rest of the cast don't slouch by any means. Rachel McAdams is perhaps the weakest out of the bunch, but even she mostly holds her own. Far and away, the most important takeaways are the devotion to pursuing the truth no matter where it leads you, as well as the integrity necessary in investigative journalism. Some people have called this the greatest journalism movie since ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but I still need to see that in order to make such a comparison. Briefly touching on other matters, I thought the score and cinematography were quite adequate enough to elevate this beyond something that would normally play as a made-for-HBO movie. In particular, I liked the use of substantial tracking shots, which visually reinforced the winding and interconnected paths that the Globe's spotlight team go on in pursuit of their story. Ultimately, there is a lot in here that could shake one's faith in humanity and human institutions, particularly religion, however I never felt like they demonized anyone. It merely acknowledged the imperfections and, some of the time, willful negligence of said institutions and the communities they serve, while also aspiring to better accountability in both. Best Picture winner or not, SPOTLIGHT is hands down one of the best that 2015 had to offer.",10,2,3,21 April 2016
500 Days of Summer," Navigating the maze of modern relationships
","My initial reaction after finishing this is 'Wow! How charming!' That kind of sums up my overall feeling about 500 DAYS OF SUMMER, although the narrative turns take you through a much wider range of emotion. The basic plot is of the 'boy meets girl' variety, with the 'boy' being played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the 'girl,' Zooey Deschanel. However, this is not your typical romantic film. Zooey Deschanel is the 'Summer' of the title, and the story hops backwards and forwards through Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer's 500 day relationship. For starters, the broken-up chronology, although somewhat of a cliché at this point, was useful insofar as it withheld plot secrets until the right moment, regulating the stream of information toward the viewer and maintaining interest. Of course, it helps that the two leads are quite likable and have pretty good chemistry together, in that awkward, post-modern way. I also thought that the message about fate/destiny being an illusory concept rather apropos in a society that has (largely) moved beyond traditional gender roles, as the film demonstrates to a high degree. In a world where those kind of barriers come down, it can be scary and more confusing, but that's often the beauty of it as well. Without things prewritten or having to conform to a set 'script,' we are free to interpret events as we choose and mold our lives to the form we desire. The only cog in the film's machine is, unfortunately, Tom, who initially displays a dangerous level of complacency and hesitancy, which proves detrimental to his relationship with Summer. By contrast, Summer is a strong, but not invulnerable, female character. I really liked her, whereas Tom had to grow on me (development!). Overall, the film is certainly a shot in the arm to the well-worn romantic dramedy. There were some nice meta touches, i.e., a dance sequence, and a split-screen sequence which shows 'Expectation vs. Reality.' Some of the social commentary did seem a little on-the-nose, and it didn't exactly move me emotionally in the greatest way, but I laughed a lot and was constantly thinking about the message the film portrayed. So, definitely one to check out if you haven't already.",8,0,0,14 August 2016
The Hateful Eight," Mostly solid parlor mystery a la Tarantino
","For the most part, Quentin Tarantino has been on a roll since the early 90's, and none of his films could be considered objectively 'bad.' Still, some are better (or more enjoyable) than others. After two solid (but imperfect) classics in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and DJANGO UNCHAINED, his follow-up, THE HATEFUL EIGHT, was kind of a step back for me. By no means am I calling THE HATEFUL bad, but it had a mean streak that undermined the fun I usually expect from Tarantino's films. The plot involves a group of eight travelers to Red Rock who converge on a bar called Minnie's Haberdashery. While there, suspicion on all sides leads to conflict. As far as Tarantino movies go, this one fits right in. All the requisite elements are there: cool dialogue, a great soundtrack, and explosions of violence. The difference here is primarily one of pacing, which might turn some people off. I didn't mind it so much, but I would understand if others did. As indicated by the title, there are no likable characters to be found, although they all do have their moments to shine. My favorite characters ended up being Samuel L. Jackson's Major Marquis Warren (no surprise) and (big surprise) Walton Goggins' Chris Mannix. The only odd fit, despite being a prior Tarantino regular, was Tim Roth as Oswaldo Mobray, who seemed to be doing a Christoph Waltz impression most of the time. Generally speaking, all the performances were good, though. My biggest issue with the film itself has to be how the mystery reveals are handled in the second half. There were no clues given as to the answer, and revealing everything in flashback without hinting at anything first (at least that I noticed on one viewing) just smacked of weak writing. Ultimately, though, THE HATEFUL EIGHT has all of the Tarantino hallmarks and is a decent film for it. Also worth noting is the score by Ennio Morricone, comprising unused cues from John Carpenter's THE THING, an interesting detail that makes complete sense when you consider how thematically similar the two films are. My only reservations would be to people not yet initiated into Tarantino's style, or those who don't like profanity and graphic violence. Otherwise, THE HATEFUL EIGHT is definitely worth a watch.",8,1,5,28 April 2016
Crash," Overly simplistic and heavy-handed
","While CRASH is most assuredly a technically well-made film, there is absolutely nothing it has to say that couldn't be ascertained from paying a little attention in the real world. Racism is definitely a problem in America (and the world), but all this film seems to have to contribute to that discussion is that it's bad. To make matters worse, every single character in the film is a stereotype. And there's also too many characters to begin with. You learn a little bit about them and their lives, but the running time didn't really allow for a deeper examination of these people and why they are the way they are. All of the performances were good, to be sure, but it was all in service of a heavy-handed script that approaches the issue of racism in the most skin-deep way possible. Despite the film's title, implying a certain degree of chance in one's encounters, every moment in the film felt calculated and calibrated for maximum emotional impact in a way that undermines the seriousness of the issues it wanted to address. At the end, no one really learns anything and, as an audience member, I was left wondering what the point was exactly. From a technical standpoint, though, the film is fairly solid. The movie is about, and (presumably) shot in, LA and the filmmakers did a good job of capturing it on film, especially in the night time. The cinematography was actually kind of beautiful, in contrast to the ugliness of the characters. I'll even give credit to the score for being relatively toned down, letting the rigged emotional stakes of the film stand out that much more. When all is said and done, I'm also left wondering how in the world this shallow nonsense ever won Best Picture. Although well-made and well-acted, it just seems like the Academy gave themselves a pat on the back for even acknowledging that racism exists. The subject deserves better and more thorough treatment than it got with this film.",4,2,3,6 March 2015
Black Mass," Welcome back, Mr. Depp, we've missed you
","I really don't know a whole lot about James 'Whitey' Bulger outside of what I got in the documentary about him that came out shortly before this film. Needless to say, he was quite an unsavory character, but interesting movies have been made about those types, even in the gangster genre. BLACK MASS didn't always work as an engaging story, despite combining two of my biggest interests (gangsters and true crime), because it never really focused on a particular aspect of the events and, as such, was a little unwieldy and never really let its characters develop. To be sure, it has an impressive cast and all of them do fine work, but few of them outside of Johnny Depp were given any room to make an impression. Still, this is a well-crafted film from a technical perspective, with excellent camera-work, a good score (courtesy of Junkie XL, no less), and a welcome return to form by Johnny Depp. This is the best I've seen him in years, possibly since DONNIE BRASCO. For all of the faults in the narrative structure, Johnny Depp is what makes this worth watching. There are times when he was legitimately frightening, even though a couple of these moments were partially given away in the trailers. Although BLACK MASS aspires to be in the same company as GOODFELLAS and DONNIE BRASCO, it doesn't quite live up to them, at least in terms of lasting quality and rewatchability. Still, it is a perfectly serviceable true crime tale with a top-notch performance by Depp, itself alone to recommend at least one viewing.",7,1,2,16 March 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," More than just a comic book movie, it's also an astute and timely political thriller
","Finally, I got to see this! This was one of my most anticipated movies this year, and boy was it worth the wait! In this latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America and a few friends take on S.H.I.E.L.D. after an assassination attempt on Nick Fury. Along the way, he uncovers some secrets that fundamentally change his understanding of how he thought things were. That's probably all the plot you need going in, because to say anymore would spoil the experience. Everything and everyone fires on all cylinders here. Chris Evans is outstanding as Captain America, as well as Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon. What I appreciated most was the attention to character development in addition to the jaw-dropping action sequences. But what surprised me was how smart this film actually is. The basic premise of the film, you could say, is 'ripped from the headlines.' With the NSA scandals and privacy vs. security debate currently going on in the US, this film couldn't be more timely. It also fits in nicely with the other films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. While the story is self-contained, there are nods to other Marvel characters and past events so that everything ties together quite well. Honestly, there's not too much more I can really say about it, except that if you haven't seen it you don't know what you're missing. Also, as expected with comic book films these days, don't forget to stay for the mid- and post-credits sequences, which hint at things to come.",10,0,1,14 November 2014
Capote," Philip Seymour Hoffman's best performance
","Philip Seymour Hoffman gives the performance of his career: a nearly flawless, nuanced portrayal of American writer Truman Capote. The story is probably ingrained in the popular consciousness due to Capote's famous book, as well as the movie adaptation starring Robert Blake, but the filmmakers manage to bring a freshness to the material that makes it engaging despite the rather low-key atmosphere projected by the images and music that accompany the story. There was also an incredible performance by Clifton Collins Jr as Perry Smith, one of the murderers who Capote develops an iffy relationship with. Overall, I thought that Hoffman did a superb job in portraying a complex (and contradictory) character and it's a must-see film.",9,1,1,14 November 2014
Pacific Rim," A decent but forgettable popcorn movie
","Guillermo del Toro brings his unique creative sensibilities to a genre that's been pushed into the ground, and while the results are entertaining and cool to watch it still has this 'been-there-done-that' feel. For one, this level of destruction has been done before in all of the Transformers movies, and while it's more competently filmed here you can't escape the feeling that you've seen most of this stuff before. A few quibbles about this: no attention is paid whatsoever to collateral damage, but then again, that's a problem with the violence in most PG-13 movies. Also, the decision to film most of the action at night and around the ocean results in it being a little hard to follow due to the poor lighting and the fact that the robots and kaiju take up most of the screen because of their immense size. Moving on, I thought that the comedic relief in the form of two bickering scientists was well written and played, although it didn't really serve the story too much until the end. In fact, the story as a whole wasn't really spectacular, and was filled with a lot of cliché moments and was very predictable. Despite all of these things, it was fun to watch and I had a good time. An entertaining, but ultimately forgettable, popcorn flick.",6,2,2,14 November 2014
American Sniper," PTSD and the toll of war on the soldier's psyche
","I went into this film with a little trepidation due to the extremely polarized reactions I saw online. Beyond that, I really wasn't too familiar with the film or Chris Kyle's life outside of the tragic way he died. Now that I've seen it, I can say that it's a good film, although its subtlety might be the reason some people read it the way they do. Far from being a pro-war statement (or anti-war, for that matter), its primary focus is in showing the toll that war takes on the soldier's psyche.A run-down of plot details isn't really necessary because you can just pick up Chris Kyle's autobiography if that's what you want. The basic structure is a series of sequences that go from Chris's home life to each of the four tours he served in Iraq. After each tour, you can see the effect that his job as sniper has on him psychologically. This is perhaps the film's best asset, although it doesn't really start to pay off until about halfway through. Before that, you have to deal with about 30 minutes of rote setup that establishes Chris's character: an all-American guy with simple values and morals. Odds are, this is what the more conservative viewers in the audience are drawn to, although to take what Chris says at face value is to miss the psychological underpinnings and point of the film.What works against the film is, unfortunately, the direction. Clint Eastwood might have been Chris's dream director (according to his wife, at least), but it's quite apparent that he was merely a hired gun. The battle sequences, which one would expect to have some flair, were competently staged but executed rather stiffly. That's not to say they were all bad, though. There were a couple of moments that really worked on a visceral and emotional level, one of which was used as a selling point in the trailers. In the scenes back home, Eastwood steps back further and lets the characters and drama unfold naturally but the whole thing still feels anonymous from a directorial perspective.Of course, given that I enjoyed the film there is plenty to give it credit for doing right. Chief among these are Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, who I feel were perfectly cast. They looked like their real life counterparts, and Bradley Cooper did some DeNiro-level character work in terms of turning himself into Chris Kyle. However, given the film's focus on war's toll on the human psyche and its effect on family, Sienna Miller did an amazing job portraying a wife who only wants to have her husband return to her alive and mentally be there. Even though it takes a while for the film to show its hand, once you see Chris Kyle's struggle to return to normal life after returning from the battlefield, all of the simplistic setup somehow feels worth it.Overall, I don't see what people got so up in arms about. No, the film doesn't question American involvement in the Middle East or the morality or war in general. It also doesn't paint Chris Kyle as some savage-killing hero/real-life Rambo. Even in the few moments where Kyle is referred to as a 'legend' he never feels quite at ease with the designation. To him, being a sniper was a job he did to protect his fellow soldiers. Simplicity of character should not be mistaken for the film itself being simplistic. Despite the unspectacular direction (and some ridiculous CGI bullet time), I thought American SNIPER was a subtle, maybe too much so, examination of the detrimental effect that war can have on the mind of a soldier and the lives of their family.",7,0,3,4 June 2015
American Hustle," Actors run amok in an excellent recreation of 1970's period detail
","American HUSTLE is a movie which is only nominally about the Abscam sting operation in late 70's/early 80's. The real heart and soul of this movie lies in the many fictional characters created for it, who are all conning each other in one way or another. Basically, the movie is about what people do in order to survive. This is a very compelling theme which is suitably explored over the course of the film, but it lacks enough narrative focus to really leave an impression. Yes, it is wonderfully acted and has some funny scenes (as well as one tense scene with a great cameo), but David O. Russell let his actors run amok with the script and it shows. On the positive side, the film features some of the best period production design and costumes I've ever seen, as well as an impeccably chosen soundtrack. Tonally, Russell seemed to be going for a Scorsese feel. This was nice, but I would have rather that Russell put more of a personal stamp on the material like he did with his previous film SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. Still, despite being a gelatinous mess of a story, American HUSTLE is a well-made, well-acted film but not much more.",6,0,1,14 November 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bests the previous two in every way: a masterclass in action and suspense
","THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM brings Jason Bourne's story to its inevitable conclusion, and does so in the best way possible. This time around, Paul Greengrass and company outdo everything they did in the previous two entries. Matt Damon and the rest of the cast give outstanding performances, and the attention to story and character this time has been fine-tuned to perfection. In this third entry, Jason Bourne finally comes home to take on the agency and find out once and for all who he is and how he got that way. The cast has been expanded slightly yet again, this time adding David Straithairn as a ruthless CIA chief who runs a black ops unit. Scott Glenn and Albert Finney also have smaller roles as the CIA Director and the doctor who introduced Bourne into the program, respectively. What ensues is a globe-hopping adventure that gives the audience some amazing on-location shooting and enthralling action set-pieces. My personal favorite, and the centerpiece of the movie is an intense chase through the streets and back alleys of Morocco, culminating in one of, if not the best hand-to-hand fights in the series. And this time, despite the chaotic nature of the cinematography, all of it was immensely more comprehensible than in the last entry, even the car chases. I also thought that they did a better job this time of balancing the different story elements and cutting between a variety of locations in a way that always kept the story moving. They also succeeded in bringing things full circle, as well as teasing some new developments which could be used in future sequels (and were, in THE BOURNE LEGACY). While bringing closure to Bourne's story, they didn't end things such a final way, which I thought was great. After all of the great storytelling of these first three, I'm definitely in the mood for more of it. Overall, I think that this is the pinnacle of the Bourne series, which was already very good to begin with. It's the American answer to Bond, as well as being an anti-Bond. It keeps you immersed in a believable world with real characters and human drama, as well as showcasing the best action that Hollywood has to offer. Seeing the previous two is kind of a prerequisite for understanding this one, but once you do, you shouldn't miss this one.",10,0,0,14 November 2014
Rush," A bold and exhilarating sports drama
","I don't particularly gravitate towards sports movies, primarily because I'm just not into sports but also because a lot of them are cliché-ridden underdog stories that have been done to death. Not so with RUSH. In what is the best film that Ron Howard has done in years, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl give excellent performances as James Hunt and Niki Lauda: Formula One drivers whose rivalry gave each other purpose and motivation to succeed. As personalities, they couldn't have been more different. James Hunt was brash, more of a ladies' man and reveled in the fame that being a race car driver afforded. Niki Lauda was more cold, calculating and concerned with the technical aspects of racing, and he could also be quite blunt. What I liked about this movie, aside from the racing aspect, was the examination of these two polar opposite personalities and the way in which they pushed each other forward. There is plenty of screen time allotted to establishing their characters, and once they meet, sparks fly. I thought both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl did an excellent job in portraying these two men, and made it seem very believable. Of course, this is a racing movie, so the other question would be how that aspect stacks up. No lie, this movie had some of the best, and most thrilling racing sequences I've seen. Ever. Apparently, they had actual drivers (and the actors) drive Formula One cars at high speeds and attached cameras to the outside to capture the feel of what it would be like to be in one of those cars. It was really exhilarating stuff, and it's a pity that I wasn't able to catch this in theaters when it first came out. I also should mention the incredible score by Hans Zimmer, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite film composers. He created an epic feel, not unlike what he did with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Still, it was distinct from that iconic score and added a lot to the overall feel of the film. There was also a good selection of 1970's classic rock. Overall, there's not a thing I can think of that's even a little wrong with this film. Every aspect of it perfectly displays the skills of the talent involved, and the central story elevates it above your typical sports drama. Even if sports movies aren't your thing, you'd be remiss for not giving this one a try.",10,3,4,14 November 2014
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," A role tailor-made for Robin Williams, and a decent war movie to boot
","'Good Morning, Vietnam' is one of Robin Williams' best movies and was one of the first to really showcase his improvisational abilities. However, it's not just a comedy and in fact, the tone of the picture is more serious than you might think going in. While Robin Williams does get to let loose in several hilarious scenes as Air Force DJ Adrian Cronauer, there is an undercurrent of seriousness which seeks to examine the effect of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese citizens, as well as what the US troops endured. It's not particularly graphic, but it didn't really need to be. Up to the time this film was released there were several highly acclaimed films on the subject already. What sets this one apart is the character of Adrian Cronauer, who uses comedy to lighten the spirits of the men serving their country overseas. Still, the film isn't without its flaws. There is a romantic subplot that seemed shoehorned in just to give the film some extra conflict. Also, by virtue of coming later, none of the messages the film tries to get across were that original either. Still, it's worth seeing this movie for Robin Williams' performance alone. Forrest Whitaker also gives a good supporting turn as Cronauer's Army buddy/escort. Another outstanding part of this film was the soundtrack, full of great 1960's tunes. There is also a moving sequence set to Louis Armstong's 'What a Wonderful World.' On historical accuracy, apparently not all of the events in the film happened as described and some were surely invented for dramatic purposes. However, that doesn't really hurt the film too much. Is this Robin Williams' absolute best film? No, but considering what came immediately before, this collaboration with Barry Levinson (who he would team up with a couple more times in his career) was a step in the right direction. Just kick back, relax and take in the comic genius that was Robin Williams.",7,1,1,13 November 2014
The Bourne Identity," A tense thrill-ride with superb action sequences
","THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a tense thrill-ride anchored by Matt Damon's strong central performance as a amnesiac assassin in search of who he is. It also kick-started the Bourne series, which raised the bar for intelligent action films. There's not too much need to go into plot details, except that Jason Bourne is a former CIA-trained assassin who is nearly killed when a job goes south. He wakes up with no memory of what happened before and sets off on a mission to find out who he is and why he is being hunted. One aspect I really liked was the balance between action and drama. The action scenes are quite relentless, but the film also allows a relationship to be developed between Matt Damon's Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente), a woman he meets practically by chance. They each have their own somewhat similar problems, and they work together to try and fix them. Normally these types of movies just focus on the protagonist, but here the audience is also exposed and given insight into the other side: the people who are trying to bring Bourne back in. Although some suspension of disbelief is required, the movie does feel grounded in reality, especially considering the recent glut of leaks regarding the NSA. In my opinion, it was nice to see the inner workings of intelligence agencies, and to top it off, a smattering of government intrigue as well. I thought the plotting was very solid, and the performances across the board were very good. The only weak link I found was Julia Stiles as Nicolette, a Paris-based CIA asset who runs a safe house. I thought her role was slightly underwritten, and her performance wasn't as good as the rest of the cast. Moving on, the technical aspects of the film were all excellent. I thought that the action sequences were well-filmed and easy to follow in a geographical sense. The fights were quite intense and well-choreographed as well. Matt Damon makes for a good action star, and this movie is proof of that. The score was also quite good, and helped maintain tension throughout the nearly two-hour running time. All in all, I thought that this was an excellent action film that can hold its own against similar series, like James Bond (which this clearly was intended as). Highly recommended for fans of action films and thrillers. You won't be disappointed.",9,3,3,14 November 2014
Armageddon," Overstuffed but serviceable popcorn flick
","If there is one positive thing about Michael Bay and his movies, it's consistency. From his very first film, it was clear what he was about: explosions, hot women and awkward humor. In almost 20 years, nothing has changed and upon watching Armageddon, it seems like this is probably his purest film marketed to the widest audience possible (since R-rated movies are limited to ages 17 and up). The story is about an asteroid which is headed towards earth. NASA recruits a team of deep core drillers to be trained as astronauts, so that they dig a hole in an asteroid where a nuclear bomb will be placed. Along for the ride is one of the most impressive ensemble casts ever, although a lot of them don't really get to do that much. Most of them are also nothing more than caricatures rather than fully developed characters. The best performances come from Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the leader of the drilling team, and Billy Bob Thornton as Dan Truman, the NASA guy who recruits Stamper in the first place. There's also Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Liv Tyler and several other recognizable actors who round out the cast. So, what worked? For starters, the filmmaking and cinematography was appropriately epic and restrained, especially compared to the hyper-kinetic style which Bay was to use with the Transformers movies. With the exception of a few intense sequences, one has a sense of place and the action is fairly easy to follow. This film also has impressive visual effects, probably the best that 1998 had to offer. Of particular note are some outer space asteroid sequences and a nicely done destruction of Paris. There was also rather good practical effects and use of miniatures, which was a nice change of pace from today's CGI-obsessed blockbusters. Moving on to where this movie falls short. One would think that with such a great cast that the movie would be outstanding as a result, and you'd only be partially correct. While the film does have a lot of individual moments that are funny, or touching, nothing really coalesces. Instead of fully-formed characters, you mostly have stereotypes and caricatures, which is rather sad for a movie that lasts 150 minutes. There's also a romantic subplot between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler that could have been completely left out. Of course, then they wouldn't have had an excuse to include one of the sappiest songs that Aerosmith has ever recorded (and whose lead singer, Steven Tyler, is Liv Tyler's father). There was also some pacing issues, namely that the first hour compresses about two weeks of training, and then the remaining 90 minutes takes place over the course of about one or two days. And of course, we get all the standard Michael Bay-isms. There's a ridiculous amount of explosions, misplaced 'humor,' leery shots of scantily clad women (from one scene in a strip club), upward facing camera angles and lots of slow motion (although not as much as some of his other work). Put together, the various ingredients which make up a Michael Bay movie do, for the most part, work here. It's not deep, and it's not trying to be either. This is popcorn entertainment at it's finest, and for sheer spectacle this is one of the best summer blockbusters ever made. That being said, I usually demand more of my movies and prefer not to have to turn off my brain very often to enjoy a movie. There are lots of people who absolutely love this stuff, but I'm not one of them. I thought it was passable entertainment, and certainly not one of Bay's worst (I'm looking at you, Transformers 2).",6,0,1,14 November 2014
North by Northwest," A thrilling action/adventure whose reach somewhat exceeds its grasp
","While not quite Hitchcock's best, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is nevertheless one of his most thrilling, and funny, motion pictures. It stars Cary Grant as an ad executive who gets mistaken for a government agent and has to go on the run in order to survive. Sound familiar? That's because the plot is kind of similar to Hitchcock's own SABOTEUR and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (although you can be certain that Cary Grant's character didn't; the bad guys just think he does). This simple premise provided for a myriad of exciting set-pieces that exemplify the kind of suspense-building and thrills that Hitch's audience were most certainly used to by this point in his career. Cary Grant is quite a good replacement for the everyman character that James Stewart played so well, and Eva Marie Saint plays a nice twist on the femme fatale as this film's Hitchcock blonde. Still, what struck me so much was how funny this film was. At certain points, it was like watching a comedy of errors combined with a spy thriller. There was also a lot more obvious sexual innuendo than in any Hitchcock picture I've seen before. Signs of the changing times, maybe? Moving on, even though it wasn't as tightly written as some of Hitchcock's other films, being essentially a bunch of action set-pieces strung together, it was still rather inventive and the momentum was kept going at a pretty good pace throughout. In particular, the crop-dusting scene and the climactic sequence on Mount Rushmore stand out from the rest, as I'm sure they do to many others who've seen the film. However, what made this not quite as perfect as could have been has a lot do with Hitchcock's tendency to do a lot of shooting on sound stages. As a result, a car chase that takes place early on (with a drunk Cary Grant) was less thrilling and believable than it could have been, and Bernard Herrmann's score had to compensate (a little too much, perhaps). And, the villains this time around weren't as memorable, mostly because we don't really see them do anything villainous. Still, James Mason was a pleasure to watch, and we get to see Martin Landau play a heavy. Overall, I do think this is better than the previous Hitchcock films I mentioned, if for no other reason than that there's more of what worked in those films. Still, at 136 minutes, it is a little too long and, like many other of Hitchcock's movies I've seen, the ending was too abrupt and a little bit of a cheat. So, while its reach does somewhat exceed its grasp in terms of the action, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is still a suitably thrilling action/adventure that ranks among the most entertaining that Hitchcock ever made.",9,1,3,10 August 2015
The Orphanage," Elegantly composed and beautifully morose
","THE ORPHANAGE, produced by Guillermo del Toro, is a clever, creepy and surprisingly poignant psychological horror film about parents' relationships to their children and the loss of a child. The story is about Laura, who grew up in an orphanage, but now has decided to return with her husband and adopted child, Simon, to run it as a home for disabled children. However, things begin to get a little weird when Simon starts to tell her about his imaginary friends who live inside the house. Then Simon goes missing, and Laura and her husband, Carlos, do everything in their power to find him.Aside from the genuinely unnerving atmosphere created in the film, the performances from the cast were all outstanding. Even the child actor who played Simon did a great job at showing a range of emotions. Still, the film belongs to Laura and her heartbreaking performance is the film's emotional core. There were a number of scenes that reveal information in a subtle way that is never manipulative and only adds to depth of the film. Only in the last act does it really succumb to the usual jump scares and a score that leads you by the hand towards the conclusion it wants you to reach. Even still, the setup was strong enough that this didn't really bother me that much.Also, even though the horror was mostly of a psychological nature, there were some other elements there that worked and one that I felt was unneeded. There was precious little gore, but what grisly images they did show served the story and were potent enough that they didn't need to linger on them for too long. There's also some haunted house tropes peppered throughout, which is understandable considering the setting. Still, it didn't exclusively rely on these which was admirable. The one thing I thought was unnecessary was a middle sequence in which Laura and Carlos seek out a medium to figure out what might have happened in the house a long time ago. Up until this point, everything was treated in a mostly realistic way, but this paranormal detour just didn't fit to me. It was well-done, but ultimately unneeded, in my opinion.Overall, THE ORPHANAGE was an excellently done horror film with some good scares and a tragic undercurrent that might make you well up with tears. It certainly had that effect on me. The performances were excellent and the atmosphere is palpable throughout. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys psychological horror films, although you might want to be careful if you're a parent with children.",9,3,5,25 November 2014
Warrior," Intense and inspirational - a real winner of a sports drama
","As I've probably mentioned before in the handful of reviews I've done for sports movies, I'm not the biggest fan of sports or sports movies in general. Still, I know a good film when I see one and WARRIOR is more than that: it's excellent. Befitting a film that deals with MMA and despite the PG-13 rating, it doesn't pull its punches physically or emotionally. This is probably one of the most intense movies I've seen from a visceral standpoint and on an emotional level. Without getting into too many specifics, the story is about two brothers who have been separated and on the outs for quite a long time. Due to personal circumstances, they both (inadvertently) enter the same MMA tournament and deal with relationship issues that have gone long unaddressed. The two leads, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton, both do an awesome job with the dramatic material while also bringing a believable physicality to their fight scenes. Although they are filmed and edited in a rather chaotic style, I thought that it worked here even if it came with the slight loss of comprehensibility. For the most part, however, you get to see all of the punches, throws and takedowns from a variety of perspectives. Also lending some dramatic heft to the film was veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays the brothers' father, also on bad terms with his sons for a variety of reasons. He was as fleshed out as were the two siblings and even gets a couple moments that seemed Oscar-worthy. In general, this wasn't some mindless story with a bunch of fight scenes strung together. Every fight had a purpose for the overall story, and there was plenty of back story for each main character to get you fully invested. So much so, that by the time the end comes around you don't know who to root for because they both have such strong motivations. It's like the Sophie's Choice of fight films. My only complaint, which is minor at best, is that once it does come around to the conclusion it lays on the melodrama a bit thick, and the final moment in the ring which was backed by an acoustic song had me rolling my eyes a little bit. Still, this was a powerful drama with incredibly brutal fight scenes that actually meant something. Even if you don't normally go for sports movies, this is one of the few that transcends that genre's limitations and manages to be inspirational without pandering. Highly recommended.",9,3,6,8 February 2015
Duck Soup," Classic Marx Brothers comedy
","DUCK SOUP is a riotously funny, anarchic comedy from the Marx Brothers which is a send-up of government and international politics. At 68 minutes, it could hardly be considered long, but if it was much longer I felt it would have worn out its welcome. The Marx Brothers' trademark humor has aged well, but I felt that some of the wordplay was hit or miss. This might be due to the rapidity with which Groucho spits out the lines, because not all of them were funny to me and quite possibly because some of them went over my head. What I felt was the best part of the movie were the physical comedy routines. As such, my favorite parts were a running gag in which Harpo torments a lemonade salesman, a scene involving a mirror and the final act where Groucho changes costumes in every scene. Since the movie is one of the earlier 'talkies', the acting is somewhat stiff/stilted (in a cinematic context, but perfectly normal in a theatrical context). Margaret Dumont's Mrs. Teasdale is probably the best example of this, although her character was supposed to be that way. Overall, I thought the movie was very well done, but I got the feeling that the Marx Brothers have done better. This type of comedy mostly works for me, and I look forward to delving further into the Marx Brothers' filmography.",7,1,1,14 November 2014
The Lego Movie," Fun for adults and kids alike, but it still hammers the audience over the head with its message
","THE LEGO MOVIE is a very entertaining, funny and, in the end, rather poignant film that will appeal to kids and adults. The story is about a nondescript, fit-in-with-the-crowd nobody named Emmett who accidentally happens upon a mythical 'Piece of Resistance.' Aided by the Master Builders, he tries to stop the universe from being ruined by Lord/President Business. Having only just watched this now, as it makes its way onto home video, I didn't watch it in theaters although I was aware of the hype and positive reactions to it, both from critics and audiences. However, I must say that I wasn't too impressed with it. The story is rather ho-hum and bland, not unlike the main character is for most of the movie. What kept me invested was all of the in-jokes and pop culture references. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny, but it did make me chuckle consistently. The best bits were probably from Batman, Superman and Green Lantern (voiced by Will Arnett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, respectively). Another strong point was the large ensemble voice cast, which included Chris Pratt (Emmett), Will Ferrell (Lord Business), Elizabeth Banks (Wild Side) and Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius/The Wizard?). Despite the rather bland story, things were practically saved near the end when it takes a rather poignant turn which I won't spoil (for the few people who haven't seen it yet). The end makes everything that came before it worth watching. Still, I can't quite bring myself to forgive everything else completely. Among those things is a ridiculously catchy earworm that gets repeated ad nauseam. In the end, it is something that both kids and adults can get enjoyment out of, even if it's more fluff than substance",7,1,2,14 November 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," One of the best films of 2013
","Matthew McConnaughey gives the best performance of his career yet in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, the story of Ron Woodruff and his struggle to obtain medicine, legal or otherwise, for his AIDS. There was also outstanding supporting work by Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto, who played a transgender AIDS patient named Rayon. When the movie begins, we are introduced to Ron Woodruff, a hard-drinking, sex-crazed, racist and homophobic man whose life is falling apart. As time progresses, he makes a gradual change to becoming a man who values his (and others') lives more due to his illness. He is also a man who doesn't give up or give in, as evidenced by his multiple run-ins with the FDA and the DEA, and symbolized by the final frames of the film. And more than anything, that is what I think the movie is about: overcoming when the odds are against you. This is a powerful and moving story, based in fact, which deserved every award it received at the Oscars. Matthew McConnaughey, on somewhat of a winning streak lately, put in some of his finest work here and went the extra mile by making a significant physical transformation to inhabit the character and person of Ron Woodruff. Jared Leto also deserves mention in this regard for his transformation as well. Jennifer Garner also does well as Ron's doctor and (eventual) friend, one of the few people not afflicted with AIDS who sees his plight and tries to help him. Her performance was imbued with a certain kindness and gentleness which I found rather appealing. As far as technical qualities are concerned, Jean-Marc Vallee did a great job directing, the cinematography was excellent and I thought that the music was good as well. There's really nothing to complain about with this film at all. Sure, it might have been Oscar bait, but that doesn't detract from the fact that this was one of the best films of 2013.",10,1,1,14 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," An excellent comic book film that gets the X-Men back on track
","This latest installment in the X-Men franchise is epic in scope and course-corrects previous mistakes (X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine), but also has a core story which is compelling, and a host of characters both new and old that elevate this to being quite possibly the best X-Men film since X2. The basics of the story is that in the post-apocalyptic future, Sentinels are evolved and have mutants on the run. In order to prevent this from happening, Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to 1973 to bring Charles and Erik together to stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, the creator of the Sentinels. What ensues is a truly epic movie that should please X-Men fans. There's not much I didn't like about the film. I thought that all of the principal characters, particularly the 1970's incarnations, were given good arcs. In particular, Charles Xavier and Mystique get the best such character moments. This is also welcome because previous installments relied too heavily on Wolverine, and while he is an important unifying force here, he isn't the primary focus. The minor characters, most of which are in the future scenes, don't get too much development but they get to show off their various powers, which were well-realized and cool to watch. Of course, I can't go without mentioning the best addition to the cast: Quicksilver. Even with his limited screen time, he establishes himself as what could become a fan favorite, and he has the film's best action sequence: a prison break at the Pentagon. Now, of course, movies can't all be visual effects and action, and this film, like the previous ones also has some other elements worthy of mention. Most notable is the use of time travel in an interesting way, and the idea that the future isn't set in stone. This is an interesting theme which hasn't been directly tackled in any prior X-Men film, and one that should resonate with all viewers. There are also the usual themes of people tapping into their better natures, and of civil rights. The only things I can find fault with is that for such an expansive storyline, it still felt like there were parts missing and the future scenes could have been beefed up a bit. I can't be the only person who wanted to spend just a little more time with the original cast before they're completely supplanted by the new, younger cast. I also wasn't as emotionally invested in this story as I was with X-Men: First Class, but I can't really say that's something you can necessarily blame the writer for. The story is just so large that it's nearly impossible to connect with it on anything but a general level. Still, the film was extremely well made in every respect.",8,0,1,19 October 2014
Inside Out," Makes up for a lack of plot with an abundance of creativity
","I'll admit to not being the biggest Pixar fan, but that's mostly because American computer animation usually isn't as compelling as other stuff I like. I also don't prefer overly 'kiddie' movies anymore, thanks to no longer being a kid. That being said, INSIDE OUT is one of Pixar's better films, even if I didn't love it as much as something like UP. To its credit, INSIDE OUT is actually more geared towards the older crowd, since a lot of the psychology of emotions will probably go over younger children's heads. In this sense, Pixar finds themselves in a bit of a bind. While expertly realized visually, literalizing the emotions just makes their manipulation that much more evident and, in my opinion, less effective. That's not to say it's all bad, because there were a number of moments that I thought were cute and funny. Its greatest fault is slow-burning an emotional payoff on top of such a thin story. In the end, though, I was won over thanks to the excellent visuals, inventive conceptualization, and outstanding voice work. Lewis Black as Anger has to be one of the best, and most spot-on, castings ever. It also wouldn't be a Pixar movie without a tearjerking moment or two. When it's all said and done, INSIDE OUT isn't the best Pixar movie ever, but it's an improvement over their last few.",7,1,19,10 February 2016
Independence Day," A silly but fun popcorn flick
","Roland Emmerich has never been one of my favorite directors, mostly because he has been making the same type of movie now for about 20 years (not unlike Michael Bay in some respects). Still, he does have a great eye for visuals and can create spectacle like few others out there. INDEPENDENCE DAY was one of his first forays into the 'disaster' genre, and as a large-scale blockbuster, it largely succeeds. Sure, there isn't a lot of attention paid to character or plot, but it delivers on the action and visuals. The ensemble cast is also great, and each person gets their own moment to shine. At first glance, one might be tempted to compare this to Armageddon, but I think that this film edges it out by a small margin. Both movies have essentially the same story beats, but the emotional arcs in this movie feel more genuine and there isn't a sappy Aerosmith ballad, either. The special effects in this movie are incredible, considering it came out in 1996 and I thought that the alien and spaceship designs were creative and nice to look at. Overall, I think that this movie has had, and will continue to have more staying power than Armageddon, if only because it did it first. Generally speaking, I enjoyed it, and if you're looking for a fun, turn-your-brain-off type of movie, you can't go wrong with this one.",7,0,0,7 October 2014
District 9," One of the best sci-fi films of the last 20 years
","Now that I've watched it a second time, it still stands out to me as one of the best sci-fi movies of the last 20 years. You have a protagonist with a clear arc, and who is someone you can sympathize with. The entire cast of characters, in fact, are fascinating to watch. I also like how genre conventions are played around with, by the having the faux-documentary feel for much of the movie. Still greater is the movie's treatment of racism as more than just a cultural problem, but something which essentially robs us of our humanity, or causes us to view others as second-class citizens. And of course, the action is first-rate, albeit with a little more shaky-cam than I'd like. All things considered, it's a must-watch regardless of its genre.",9,1,1,14 November 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," An excellent sequel despite a slightly bloated narrative
","I do have some misgivings about The Hobbit being split into three parts, as I'm sure many others do too. If it needed to be split at all, two parts would have done just fine, as the book is also divided into two parts. Still, I can't complain with most of what I've seen. Visually and in terms of spectacle, Peter Jackson continues to outdo himself with every successive film. Still, that doesn't change the fact that these movies have been padded with extra material in an effort to tie them more strongly to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, what Peter Jackson has given us is just fine and quite enjoyable. Riveting even.This film begins a year before Bilbo and the company start off on their journey at a meeting between Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf. While this might have been more at home in the previous installment, it does add character depth and clarifies the motivation behind wanting to take back the mountain. The film then proceeds to continue where the last one left off. On their way to the mountain, they encounter all manner of creatures, from giant spiders and orcs, to elves and humans. At times it feels a little episodic, with the company going from one setpiece to another, but the overall narrative thrust and ultimate goal keep the story going along at a nice pace.If there's one major complaint I have, and not just with this installment, it's that Peter Jackson has grown very reliant on CGI to augment, and in other cases completely replace practical effects. In no case is this more apparent as in the orcs, which are largely CGI. They worked very well in the Lord of the Rings as actual people with makeup, and I don't understand why they couldn't have continued that way in this Hobbit trilogy. Still, I digress slightly. There were also moments where it was clear that they were on sets. It took a little bit out of the magic of it all, but I was still wowed by the depth, breadth and level of detail in the landscapes. Also, for a movie with a lot of walking and talking, the action, when it came, served its purpose well. I kind of wish I had seen this in theaters for the sheer spectacle of it all. Two sequences that stand out in particular were a barrel escape from the elves, while being attacked by orcs, and the moment when the company finally meets Smaug. These two sequences stand out as being among the best in the trilogy so far, full of action and tension.Acting-wise, everyone gives a great performance, although I still can't really distinguish between most of the dwarfs. I'll also give major props to Benedict Cumberbatch for some outstanding voice work as Smaug. However, there were also a couple of small roles, one in particular (which I won't spoil) which kind of took me out of the movie. One final positive I'll mention is the incredible (as usual) score by Howard Shore. It really helps to set and maintain the epic tone of the film. Overall, while not perfect, THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is a stellar production of a classic story (or at least part of one) and sets up the finale quite nicely. Any serious film fan should want to see this, and I highly recommend watching it.",8,1,3,14 November 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," An overly contrived and deliberately depressing slog
","Based on the best-selling novel by John Green and starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is an occasionally poignant, but contrived, story about love and life. The plot is really easy to summarize, as it follows the basic YA formula of having two people who are quite different enter into a romance with each other. The only difference, and what I feel to be most contrived part of all, is that both of them have cancer. I wouldn't necessarily call myself cynical, but this seems to me like one of the cheapest ways to get audience sympathy. I suppose John Green set out to write a ridiculously depressing tearjerker of a novel, and for its target demographic it seems to have worked like a charm. However, I am not so easily swayed and this film didn't work on me the way it might work for others. That's not to say it wasn't well-made or well-acted, because it is, but the story felt deliberately constructed to get a certain reaction and in that respect, again for me, it failed. Neither one of the leads was particularly likable or interesting to me, and some of the dialogue they were given to say felt odd and unnatural: stuff I can't really picture teenagers actually saying. I also thought that the voice-over was a weak point, as it kind of gives away the endgame a little too early and removes tension about the main character's survival. Still, it wasn't all bad. I did enjoy the segment of the film in which Hazel and Augustus travel to Amsterdam to meet the writer of Hazel's favorite novel, 'An Imperial Affliction.' I won't spoil the cameo for those who haven't seen the film, but I enjoyed his character and the brutal honesty he portrays, despite him being somewhat of an a-hole. I also did appreciate some of the conclusions that the film draws about the relationships we have with others and what we leave behind. It's just a bit sad that the film wallows in so much misery and self-pity to get there. Not having read the book and not usually liking this type of film, I already know that this probably wasn't meant for me. Still, I like to go in with an open mind and give certain things a shot, especially when they're generally well-received. I'd hesitate to call this a bad film, but I will say I didn't like it. Fans of the book will probably love the hell out of this, but I was left mostly cold.",4,0,3,11 February 2015
Twilight," Cheesy, but watchable
","For a cheesy teen romance, this wasn't too bad. The style isn't too overbearing, nor is it too spectacular, but at least there wasn't an air of pretension about it. However, the style is definitely what the movie has going for it, because the story is rather ordinary and doesn't take too many risks. It can go without saying that most of the acting is wooden and that the leads don't have too much chemistry in the traditional sense, but the teenage awkwardness that is very much a part of the story lends it a sort-of authenticity that it never really is a chore to watch. It's unexceptional, but serviceable. Digging deeper into the plot, it is rather hard to accept that a teenager, presumably without a firm grasp on true love, would fall so hard for somebody she just met, but again, it passes by on the viewer without much event. There's also something inherently creepy in a lot of the implications of their relationship. Edward is a forever-17-year-old who is romantically involved with Bella, who really is her age (16 or 17, maybe?). I could enumerate some more plot oddities, like how Bella figures out who Edward is through internet research, but all of the complaints one could make can be attributed to one thing, which is the single biggest flaw here: the source material. Stephenie Meyer has such an immature view on love, sexuality and relationships and one that is also old-fashioned to a fault. Bella's greatest aspiration is to have a man, and they have to wait to consummate their relationship. The characters are also not written that well either. Bella is simultaneously dumb (by her own admission), yet is somehow perceptive enough to get a good psychological read on someone. Every character quirk doesn't seem to be natural, and instead is just necessary for the plot. That being said, the movie is somewhat interesting to watch for how much of a train-wreck the script is. And for readers of the books, probably mostly just teenage girls and their moms, the movie works just fine as a fantasy. One thing I did think was done well was the subtle hinting at the vampire-werewolf tension to come. Another thing I think wasn't done so well was the special effects, which weren't too believable. That, however, is a minor quibble when compared to the enormous problems inherent to the book which this is based on. Still, I was never bored watching this and, even though I didn't particularly get into it the way a fan of the books would have, it was relatively un-offensive and (dare I say) I enjoyed it a little bit. It's not a good movie, per se, but it did have a certain charm to it.",6,0,4,13 November 2014
The Princess Bride," An enjoyable (and extremely quotable) fairy tale, but still less than the sum of its parts
","THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is revered by Gen-X-ers and 80's babies, along with THE GOONIES and other children's films that have a certain adventurousness and whimsy to them. I, however, was born at the tail end of the decade, and missed out on a lot of these cinematic treasures as a child. Finally, I have rectified that by watching this film, which is firmly ingrained in the pop culture consciousness. Does it live up to the hype? Yes and no. From a filmic perspective, the narrative is a bit formulaic and cliché, like the storybook tales that this movie takes its inspiration from. On the other hand, there are plenty of moments of pure genius that make it stand out from the rest. Fortunately, the latter outweighs the former and overall it was a perfectly enjoyable viewing experience.The story, although about the titular Princess Bride, is actually framed by a grandfather reading a book to his sick grandson. I think that this part is essential to making the film work because it gives the audience a way to understand the story and how it works on more than just a surface level. Fred Savage's character is the audience stand-in and his questions and commentary can represent the questions of all little boys who have been told fantastical stories by their own relatives. The grandfather can represent the director, or any family member who has served a storytelling role, and guides the audience through this familiar, yet not too familiar tale. The story of the Princess Bride itself is reminiscent of many a fairy tale, and like many before it tells how true love overcomes great obstacles. There is a great cast of characters, many serving up some choice and memorable dialogue that has gone down in the pantheon of great quotes. My personal favorites were from Vizzini, Inigo Montoya and the Impressive Clergyman.In terms of quality, Rob Reiner did a great job directing his actors, who all give great performances. Even Robin Wright does an impressive job for her first big-screen role which, aside from Jenny in FORREST GUMP, is the role she is best known for playing. The filming aspect was also quite well done, with most of it being done on well-constructed and detailed studio sets. The cinematography, while not particularly memorable or flashy, was competent in workmanlike kind of way. The real weakness here is the script which, while serving up plenty of individual moments worthy of praise, didn't always flow naturally, and not because of the framing story either. There is also a long stretch of the movie where Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and Fezzik (Andre the Giant) disappear, which just seemed odd to me. In my opinion, the story could have been fleshed out a little more in some respects. Still, what is there works for the most part, and I can't really fault it for trying to mix things up a bit.Overall, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a perfectly enjoyable movie, even if it doesn't live up to the enormous praise heaped upon it. The movie does have some flaws, but those are mild in comparison to the great storytelling on display and great dialogue, which enhance its replay value. Highly recommended, especially if you haven't seen it yet.",7,2,4,14 November 2014
Saving Private Ryan," A brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war
","I've seen my fair share of war films, but it's really surprising that I've waited this long to finally see (in full) what is probably the greatest WWII film ever made. There's probably no amount of words that I could write that would do justice to what I feel like having seen this for the first time. The only thing I regret is not having seen it on a bigger screen (although, to be fair, I was 9 years old when this first came out).The plot, as if anyone didn't know it by now, is that an Army captain (Tom Hanks) who just landed at Normandy Beach is charged with retrieving a Private Ryan, the last surviving of his mother's sons, and returning him safely home. Of course, as all of the characters point out several times throughout the film, they run into a lot of FUBAR (Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition) situations. And if there's one truth that this film gets at, it's that war is ugly (original, I know right?). Still, the call of duty is just as important to every single one of these men as is their devotion to each other. They face a lot of moral quandaries, and even make some questionable decisions, but when it all comes down they have each others' backs and the knowledge that completion of the mission will earn them the right to go home. I can't really think of a stronger motivation than that.Another thing which this film does right is with its selection of story, which also plays into the human element. The mission isn't to take a hill or some other landmark: it's to rescue someone. Using WWII as a setting for this story allows the average person to really connect with it on a deeper level than if it had just been a typical war film with a large ensemble cast. And by the way, the cast in this movie is pretty insane. Granted, there are many films before it (THE LONGEST DAY is one example that comes to mind) that did the same thing, but the attention to character in this one sets it apart from the rest. There are elements of cliché, but every main character is fully fleshed out.This film is also extraordinary for its cinematographic approach. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski utilized a hand-held style which puts you into the thick of the action and aptly portrays the chaos and confusion inherent in those situations. This is also enhanced by a gritty look partially achieved by shooting on film. Last, but not least, there is an emotionally resonant score by John Williams which punctuates the story at all the right moments yet is never intrusive or overbearing. I also appreciated the diegetic use of the Edith Piaf song, 'Tu es partout' before a climactic scene, and which conveys to the audience the feelings of the people these men left behind in service to their country (even though it's a song about love lost, and to be sure there were plenty of people who never came back).Overall every single one of these elements, including some I haven't mentioned, combine to create a brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war, the heights of which has been reached by few. And not just that, it managed to do all of this without leaning too far in the direction of being pro- or anti-war. It presents it as is, the good with the bad, and doesn't demonize the enemy as so many films are apt to do. Hopefully this hasn't been too long-winded, but this is an incredible film that deserves to be seen by everyone.",10,4,7,3 February 2015
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Slightly lesser sequel, but only by a little bit
","In this sequel to the 2010 smash hit, Hiccup and Toothless discover an ice cave that is home to even more dragons and come face to face with a villain who is amassing a dragon army. This time around, as is typical with sequels, they up the ante and the stakes are raised. There's even more dragons and not only that, but there's also a greater variety. But more importantly, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 has the same charm and heart that made the first one so enjoyable in the first place. We get a deeper look at Hiccup's relationship with his father, and he also meets and bonds with his long-lost mother who turns out to be a kindred spirit. All of the supporting cast is back, too, and funny as ever. My favorite running gag was Astrid continually being smitten by a dragon trapper, Eret (voiced by Kit Harington). Sadly, though, the villain was rather weak in terms of motivation and his actual presence in the film. He wasn't introduced properly until about halfway through, and the way in which he was defeated was a bit cheesy, making him seem like somewhat of a pushover compared to the villain in the last one. However, despite the weakness of the central conflict, there are some resonant themes which are explored. The primary one, and one which has been done before in other films, is that of finding your true self. Hiccup is torn between his father naming him as his successor and living a free life with the dragons like his mother. More relevant to the central conflict is the struggle for peace when those opposed to you have their minds set on war. Hiccup remains an idealist for much of the running time, but ultimately discovers that occasionally you do have to fight for what you believe is right. Both of these messages should appeal to the demographic this movie is aimed at, especially the first one. The film also takes a rather poignant turn in the third act (which I will not spoil) that should have people reaching for their handkerchiefs. Overall, this sequel, while not quite living up to its predecessor in terms of the central conflict, is still a rollicking, fun time for kids and adults alike. If you saw and liked the first one, there's not a reason I can think of that you wouldn't feel the same here.",8,1,3,17 January 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A decent and enjoyable tale elevated by visual panache
","Although it has a rather ordinary story, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is told in an interesting way, and with some of the most picturesque cinematic images I've seen in recent years. The story is about Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), who is the concierge of the titular hotel. He takes a young immigrant boy, Zero, under his wing as his new lobby boy. Over the course of the movie they go on a series of adventures stemming from the death of one of Gustave's many lovers, Madame D (an almost unrecognizable Tilda Swinton) and a painting called 'Boy with Apple.' They also meet many colorful characters on the way, played by Wes Anderson's usual stable of actors. I must confess to not being the biggest Wes Anderson fan, and in fact, this is only the second of his films that I have seen, after BOTTLE ROCKET. There is a certain air of pretentiousness that one can feel about his work, like he's only making these films to amuse himself. Yet, there was a playfulness with this one and, in the end, a rather emotional turn that won me over. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the film and thought it was immaculately composed from a visual perspective. It was like every frame could be a perfect photograph, and this is definitely where Wes Anderson's strengths lie. I also enjoyed the quirkiness of the characters with which this film was populated. Though most of the big name actors who appeared here took what basically amounted to cameos, they brought a lot to the few scenes in which they appeared. As far as acting is concerned, everyone gave a great performance, especially Ralph Fiennes. Wes Anderson's flowery and poetic dialogue just flowed off of his tongue effortlessly, and with style. The actor who played a young Zero also did a fine job in his first role. Overall, I thought this was an excellent, if typical Wes Anderson film. The story does get a bit convoluted in the end, but the stylistic choices and the way you are enveloped in this fantasy world overshadows any weakness that the narrative has. A definite must-see, especially for Wes Anderson fans.",8,0,2,14 November 2014
The Transporter," Not much going on plot-wise, but still a whole lot of fun
","While it certainly won't win any awards for originality (nor did it), THE TRANSPORTER is probably the best solo vehicle for Jason Statham that I've seen up to this point (to include stuff that has come out more recently). It's an all-thrills, no frills action movie with minimal character development and a logically incoherent plot, but the action sequences and Jason Statham's charisma as a leading man more than make up for the flaws in the narrative. Certain elements date it a little bit (a few soundtrack cuts in particular), and it almost feels like a relic of the 90's except for the fact that this came out in 2002. Still, I have great nostalgia for these types of movies and I had a great time watching it. Not only that, but there was some humor peppered into the mix which makes it contrast favorably to other movies that take themselves a little too seriously. Overall, this is a must-see if you're a fan of Jason Statham or action movies in general.",7,0,0,9 November 2014
Revolutionary Road," American Beauty: The 1950's Version
","Directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD would like to be a scathing indictment of 1950s America and suburbia but unfortunately fails to say anything fresh, and its satirical edge is remarkably dull. Still, there were some fine performances and individual moments that stand out, not to mention the excellent filmmaking on display. The story is about the Wheelers, a couple who live in the Revolutionary Hill Estates, a Connecticut suburban community. On the outside their life looks idyllic, but underneath it all there is a deep dissatisfaction and resentment that begins to manifest itself. The banality of suburban life is not a new topic in literature or film, and this film does a good job getting the surface details right in order to make its point rather clear. However, I didn't feel like it did anything I haven't seen before in other films, like THE ICE STORM and Sam Mendes' own 'American Beauty.' In fact, this felt a lot like 'American Beauty,' with the exception that it was set in the 1950s. Even the score was reminiscent of the one for that previous film. However, that one had a more arty feel that this film didn't have. Still, despite the (ironically) banal subject matter, this film was well put together on every front, both technical and performance-wise. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a good job playing their roles, although there isn't too much depth to their characters at all. There were a few smaller roles that had familiar faces behind them, but they also felt under-developed. By far the best performance in the entire film was a small role played by Michael Shannon, the temporarily institutionalized son of the couple who sold the house on Revolutionary Road to the Wheelers. His couple of scenes have that acerbic wit and bite to them that I wish had been more prevalent in the overall story, which felt downright sterile at times. From a technical standpoint, the film is flawless and the photography was beautiful, belying the ugliness of the atmosphere projected by its characters. Overall, I didn't hate this film but I didn't think it entirely justified its existence either. It does a good job of portraying suburban malaise, but at the end of it you have to ask 'So what?' Still it made for a pleasant, if unspectacular, viewing experience and was capped off with the perfect ending.",6,0,0,12 January 2015
Foxcatcher," Slow-burning, cerebral character study - not for those with a short attention span
","FOXCATCHER is a film that is easier to admire than to love, and I mean that in the best way possible. While the slow and deliberate pacing will put a lot of people off, its disturbing subject matter, psychological depth and outstanding performances make it fascinating, if not riveting. For those unaware of what the story is about (like I was), the film mostly revolves around Mark and David Schultz, two Olympic gold medal-winning wrestlers who become involved with eccentric millionaire (billionaire?) John Du Pont, specifically in preparation for the 1988 World Championship and Seoul Olympics. But wrestling is just the conduit for a deep character study of people who looked to overcome personal weakness by achieving greatness. It's really hard to say who gives the best performance out of the three leads because all of them do so well. Mark Ruffalo (who plays Dave Schultz) usually does well, and this is no exception. Steve Carell was barely recognizable as the eccentric Du Pont, greatly aided by prosthetics in his physical transformation, but also quite different in the way he spoke and carried himself compared with what roles he usually plays. I suppose the biggest surprise of them all is Channing Tatum (playing Mark Schultz) who manages to hold his own against these other two acting greats. Although he didn't have a whole lot of dialogue (and really, the film as a whole doesn't), the physicality he brought to the role was incredible in its own right. As for the wrestling scenes, they were shot well, if unspectacular. Basically they did what they needed to do for the narrative, i.e., serve as guideposts so that one didn't get lost in the pacing (and also because they were factual). What interested me the most, though, was the curious relationship that develops between John Du Pont and Mark Schultz. Du Pont takes Mark under his wing, provides him with living quarters, a training facility, and pays him, yet his status as the team coach (and quite a rich one at that) makes it where the relationship is rather one-sided. In real life, John Du Pont was the black sheep of his family and a very lonely man, and taking on Mark Schultz was a way for him to indulge in his interests and to have a friend. Now, as interesting as I find true crime, there usually has to be some stylistic choice or a scene or two which get to me in an emotional way, and this film has that as well. Both of these scenes are dialogue-free and are scored using Arvo Part's 'Fur Alina,' a hauntingly minimal piano piece which I recently discovered. To me, these scenes (which I won't spoil) perfectly capture the film's melancholy tone. And in general, the score is rather tasteful. Often, the sound design will completely take a back seat and certain scenes will play out free of dialogue with a sort of humming that brings a subtle intensity and a growing sense of dread. Overall, FOXCATCHER is an excellent, dark character study that features some great performances and an ending that will shock you even if you see it coming. Highly recommended, as long you have a good attention span.",8,7,10,6 April 2015
28 Days Later...," 'Documentary realism' take on the zombie genre which is a little boring
","The zombie genre, honestly, is an overpopulated one. What, with THE WALKING DEAD and numerous recent attempts to cash in on the craze, it's a little hard to separate oneself from the crowd when in the shadow of what George Romero already did. 28 DAYS LATER came at the early end of this recent uptick in zombie films and does manage to differentiate itself, mainly through a straightforward, 'realistic' take that recasts zombies as humans infected with a virus. The only problem I found with this approach is that it robs the material of much potential for social commentary. I also found the choice to film on digital video a rather irritating one, giving the film a gritty, but cheap, look. At times, even the dialogue was difficult to make out. I also had took issue with the pacing, as roughly the first half of the film could have been streamlined a little bit in order to get Cillian Murphy's character from the hospital where we find him, to the family meets, and finally to the military base where second half takes place. Quite frankly, the film is kind of boring until he meets other survivors. For me, the second half is where the real meat of the film lies, and you get to see how in the event of a massive traumatic event, humanity reverts to brute (and uncouth) methods of survival. Here, Christopher Eccleston as the base commander, delivers what I think is the best performance of the film. The other cast members do fine, but there was little to latch onto as far as character development was concerned. As for the horror elements, I thought action and gore were well-handled, but the frame-dropping or speed-ramping was a little bit annoying. There was also some tricky editing going on to make things seem more intense than they really were. Some people might like that, but I typically don't. Ultimately, I ended up with about half of a good movie. It's not terrible, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the results either.",5,3,5,5 May 2016
It Follows," Drenched in atmosphere while curiously lacking in substance
","There seems to be quite a few films recently which hearken back to the late 70's/early 80's in terms of filmmaking style. IT FOLLOWS is one of the films in this mold that capture a certain feeling of nostalgia while also having its foot firmly planted in the present. It's about a vague entity that follows you around after having sex with somebody who also has the same problem. Inasmuch as the Friday THE 13TH series was about abstinence, IT FOLLOWS is in a similar vein, with a heavy dose of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Wes Craven for good measure. The most outstanding part of this film is the subtle approach taken with the horror, letting it build quietly without using the score to jolt you. There was also great care taken with the direction and cinematography that helped to build an atmosphere of tension and dread. Even without being a horror movie (albeit, more of a psychological one), the cinematography and camera-work was excellent, with precise, deliberate movement, slow pans and zooms, etc. It was quite artful, to say the least. I should also mention the outstanding score by Disasterpeace, which captures a feeling I haven't felt since watching HALLOWEEN. So, at least on the surface, IT FOLLOWS has a lot going for it. However, I do ask a little bit more from movies I watch than to impress me visually and aurally, and apart from these qualities, IT FOLLOWS was quite banal. The acting was decent, although no one really stood out from the rest. The potential in the setup for this 'it' to be anything or anyone allowed for a few good sequences, but it also meant that the narratively was a little too linear for my tastes. It boils down to have sex, wait, and run. And for a 100 minute film, I expected more. There wasn't even an underlying emotional subtext like was in THE BABADOOK. Still, despite being bored through parts of it, the film does manage to pull together for a decent (and appropriate) finish. I would recommend people to see this, but don't go in expecting something revolutionary. There is a little bit of subtext about abstinence/STDs that can be read into IT FOLLOWS and, courtesy of a CHARADE billboard, possibly some meta-commentary on artificiality. However, IT FOLLOWS works perfectly fine as a stylistic exercise that aspires to little more than imitating its cinematic forebears, and does an admittedly good job at it.",6,0,7,5 September 2015
Legend," Double the Tom Hardy doesn't quite make it double the fun
","Any movie should be able to stand on its own, independent of whatever source material or basis in historical fact it has. Keeping that in mind, I'm not terribly concerned with LEGEND's historical accuracy. More importantly, does it efficiently tell an interesting story? I'm a bit mixed on that element, but there is no denying that, however gimmicky the decision was, Tom Hardy killed it in his double role as Reggie and Ronnie Kray, gangsters from London's East End. No matter what flaws the film has, and there are more than a few, LEGEND is worth at least one viewing for Tom Hardy alone, who seems to choose projects where he can shine as an actor, regardless of whether the material deserves it, or his supporting cast is given much to do. I thought he did a great job differentiating the two performances, although the actor's bag of tricks was more obvious with his choices for Ronnie (fake teeth, glasses, accent, etc.). The next most engaging character was Emily Browning as Frances Shea, Reggie's wife, who also serves as the film's omniscient narrator. What initially seems like an oddball choice actually makes sense later on, although divulging why would be a spoiler (for those unfamiliar with the history, which I was). The film also has gorgeous cinematography, immaculate production design, and a well-chosen soundtrack full of 1960's pop tunes. It's these last few things, outside of the gangster genre, tie it to something to which it never quite lives up, i.e., Martin Scorsese's own forays into gangster pictures. One would have to be completely ignorant of cinema to miss parallels between LEGEND, and Scorsese's GOODFELLAS and CASINO. Director Brian Helgeland clearly shows affection for those films, but nothing he does here rises above the level of simple homage or, in a few cases, outright theft. Just to provide a few examples, Reggie and Ronnie's relationship has shades of key relationships in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, and Ronnie at times seems like a riff on Joe Pesci's character from those films (with homosexuality thrown in for good measure). There's also a wedding scene set to the Dixie Cups' 'Chapel of Love' and a scene late in the film which is kind of like the 'Get your shinebox!' scene in GOODFELLAS. Again, there's nothing inherently wrong with lifting elements or paying homage to previous films, which is something that happens all of the time. For it to work, there needs to be some fresh perspective or take on it, and I don't think that Helgeland ever does that. Outside of the Krays' contentious relationship with each other, there was no unifying theme to drive forward what was a rather unfocused narrative, often feeling like a collection of scenes instead of a coherent story. In short, it was like a jewel-encrusted plastic crown. There's also the issue of the title, which I don't think it earned. Nothing in the film would suggest that the Krays were 'legends,' and merely asserting it as fact was insufficient. All of this being said, there definitely is an audience for this film and I have a feeling like they (including myself) will want to see it at least once. It doesn't compare favorably to its cinematic forebears, but there is enough good in it to make a loose recommendation.",6,0,0,10 May 2016
Gone Girl," A cynical, 21st Century look at love and marriage
","David Fincher is one of my favorite directors, and for good reason. He's able to take ordinary or middling source material and spin gold out of it. Such is the case with his latest film, GONE GIRL. GONE GIRL is the story of Nick and Amy Dunne, a seemingly happy married couple who live in a Missouri suburb. However, Nick's life turns into a living hell on the morning of their fifth anniversary when he comes home to find his wife missing, and eventually a suspect in her disappearance. In case there are people who haven't seen the film (or read the book), I'll stop here to avoid going into spoiler territory. The film, for me, is a success in every category. David Fincher has yet again created a visually rich and technically superb film that is beautifully shot. The performances were also incredible, from a perfectly cast Ben Affleck as Nick to Rosamund Pike as his wife, Amazing Amy. In fact, Rosamund Pike is a revelation in this film and, in my opinion, gives the second best female performance of 2014 (first place going to Essie Davis for THE BABADOOK). She does an excellent job at portraying a manipulative, conniving woman and Ben Affleck was perfect as her affable husband. It should go without saying that this film does not paint a pretty picture of marriage, and in fact is downright cynical towards it. In a more general sense, it takes a look at the facades we put up for others and the degree to which we attempt to influence other peoples' perception of ourselves. How much is truthful, and how much is a lie? To a lesser degree, the film also examines the way in which popular media affects public perception. This is portrayed in the film by a Nancy Grace stand-in, Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle). And, believe it or not, Tyler Perry is great as Tanner Bolt, the lawyer that Nick hires to prepare his case, and also helps him do some image rehabilitation. Overall, I loved the film's acerbic wit and satirical edge, not to mention that the story takes a number of twists and turns that you won't see coming. This is one of my favorite films from last year, and I highly recommend seeing it.",9,4,9,19 January 2015
The Theory of Everything," Worth seeing for Eddie Redmayne's performance alone
","THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING has everything you'd expect from the typical Hollywood biopic, and as such is rather predictable. Not only that, but its subject is still alive (and very famous) which robs it of a lot of dramatic tension. Still, Eddie Redmayne gives an extraordinary, transformative performance as Stephen Hawking, as does Felicity Jones as his long-suffering first wife Jane. The story starts with Hawking's years at Cambridge and up through the publication of 'A Brief History of Time.' Instead of focusing on the accomplishments, the film is really about the relationship between him and his first wife, as the book is based on her memoir. The romance kind of comes out of nowhere, but after spending two hours with them you really begin to feel for them, especially Jane, who ended up having to put in overtime as her husband's caregiver (until help was brought in). The scenes which show the gradual progress of Hawking's condition (Motor Neuron Disease/ALS) were quite moving as well, but only in the most general sense. It also 'helped' that the score hinted at just the right moments when you were supposed to be emotionally affected. So, while the film is sure to stir up emotion and possibly provoke tears at certain points, nothing the film does with those moments is that special in and of itself. What really makes this film worth seeing is for Eddie Redmayne's performance, which deservedly won him the Best Actor Oscar this year. Of course, the rest of the cast, which includes Emily Watson, Charlie Cox and David Thewlis, does outstanding work as well. Overall, it's not particularly groundbreaking in terms of the biopic and romance formula, or in its execution, but Eddie Redmayne takes it to another level with his portrayal of one of the world's greatest living minds.",7,0,0,26 March 2015
Good Will Hunting," A superbly written and acted film
","GOOD WILL HUNTING, even though there really aren't any narrative surprises, is filled with wonderful dialogue and bolstered by strong performances. The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who is a bit of a hard case when it comes to his personal life, but is also a mathematical genius. Together with the help of an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a psychologist (Robin Williams) he comes to understand his true potential. The best parts of the film are the many dialogue scenes, some emotionally deep and others biting, that add so much depth to the characters. This was a passion project for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and it shows. The dialogue felt natural and true to life, which adds to the authenticity of the overall experience. Though everyone (including Ben Affleck) turns in an excellent performance, Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good. Matt Damon is the hard-headed young adult who is afraid to let people in, and Robin Williams is a professor with experience and insight that he uses to get to Will. Even though the narrative structure wasn't the tightest, there was something to enjoy about every scene, and all of them added something to the overall picture. I should also mention that Minnie Driver does a great job as Will's girlfriend, and Casey Affleck has a few of the best lines. As far as other aspects go I enjoyed the score, which was never intrusive or told the audience how to feel. There was also a rather eclectic soundtrack which fit the moods of various scenes perfectly. Overall, it was a superbly written film with equally good performances.",9,2,5,13 November 2014
Room," A compelling and emotionally engaging examination of a touchy subject
","I'm a sucker for emotional dramas, and even more so if they deal with difficult and/or sensitive subject matter. ROOM is both of those things and does so in a tasteful fashion. I also haven't been so emotionally invested in a film since probably PRISONERS. The story revolves around and Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma (whose real name is Joy) was abducted as a teenager and lives in a garden shed, affectionately (or not so, depending on how you interpret it) referred to as 'Room,' with her now-five-year-old son, Jack. When the opportunity arises, Jack escapes and the real meat of the story begins. First off, I was very impressed with performances in the film. Brie Larson does excellent work, but I was even more surprised by Jacob Tremblay. Even though he's quite young, he was able to convey a dramatic range that, although suiting the role in particular, sometimes isn't achieved by older actors. Playing someone who's spent his entire life in captivity, he portrayed the wide-eyed curiosity required as well as the confusion in someone whose perspective on the world is fundamentally changed. There were a number of intense and/or emotional scenes, and he nailed every single one. I also liked how, even though the story deals with women who have been abducted, there was a bit more going on under the surface. Separating the narrative from the obviously horrible situation in which a woman is raped repeatedly, you can see the film also dealing with the psychological effect when a woman has motherhood thrust upon them, the culture shock when someone who has lived in isolation comes into contact with the 'real world,' etc. There was a lot going on than a simple escape from captivity, in other words. The only issue I could possibly come up with is that the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the suspenseful first half. Once mother and son are freed, the narrative drive is somewhat lost, or at least goes into a holding pattern for a while. The difference in pacing is noticeable, although I wasn't terribly bothered by it. And, the film wraps up in a satisfying way anyway. All things considered, ROOM is an extremely compelling story that will have some people reaching for a tissue. It has great performances, cinematography, score, etc., and is certainly one of the best films of 2015.",9,2,4,16 April 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," An earnest and heartfelt story about self-discovery and living up to your potential
","THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY was one of many films that I was unable to see in theaters in 2013, and I was more than little worried given the rather lukewarm critical reception that it received. Thankfully, now having seen it, those fears have been assuaged. This film, while still a little overly earnest, is heartfelt and has a good message. And outside of the NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM movies, it's also one of the few films Ben Stiller has done that's appropriate for families. The story is about Walter Mitty who, in this film version, works for Life Magazine as a negative asset manager. Basically, he keeps track of all of the photographs that come in. As the magazine is in transition to becoming online only, a famous photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) sends in a roll for use in the final print issue. In particular, one negative (#25) is to be used as the cover. However, it's missing and Walter has to track it down and find it. This serves as the springboard for Walter, a rather insular fellow who tends to zone out and daydream, to get out and make something of his life. One thing I really liked about this movie was the way in which it seamlessly blended Walter's fantasies with the real world. They offered insight into an otherwise closed-off personality (at least in the beginning), and were realized visually in a very cool way. I also enjoyed the overall visual aesthetic of the film, which had lots of wintry blues, grays and whites. The characters were satisfactorily drawn, although none of them were terribly deep, save Walter. I thought Kristin Wiig gave a nice performance, but her character was never really given much to do other than be the object of Walter's affections. On the downside, for all of the buildup to a few things which I won't spoil here, the end result is a bit underwhelming. Still, the journey to the end (and to the discoveries found there) is an interesting one. This movie turned out to be much better than I expected. It's a fun film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Highly recommended.",8,1,1,14 November 2014
The Elephant Man," An unabashedly sentimental masterpiece from David Lynch
","THE ELEPHANT MAN is a powerful and moving story with incredible performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Based on a true story, the movie is about John Merrick, a horrifically deformed man who Anthony Hopkins' character (Frederick Treeves) finds as a sideshow freak in a carnival. Initially, he only displays him in a similar manner to his colleagues (he's a doctor), but after finding out that the man is intelligent he begins to care for him. The movie isn't quite easy to sit through, as you see the mental and physical abuse that John is put through. But for all the moments like that, there are many more touching moments that will put a smile on your face and/or a tear in your eye. I'll be honest, I cried on more than one occasion, and this has to be one of the most emotionally powerful movies I've ever seen. Family-friendly, has a great message and highly recommended for anyone.",10,8,9,14 November 2014
22 Jump Street," More of the same, but still a good time
","Even though this is essentially the same movie as the first, there is enough meta-humor and self-awareness that you almost don't notice how derivative it is. This time Jenko and Schmidt are off to college to find the dealer/supplier for another synthetic drug (WHY-PHY) and have relationship hiccups along the way. All of the best parts of the first movie are back. There's more of Ice Cube's Captain Dickson, Jenko's non-sequiturs and Schmidt's awkward rambling. The two standout parts of the film are a brunch scene with an awesome cameo and the end credits. Still, I didn't think that it was as funny as the first one. As far as acting goes, everyone did a good job, although Channing Tatum and Ice Cube come off looking better than the rest of the cast. When it's all said and done, fans of the first one will enjoy this a lot and others need not apply.",7,1,3,12 December 2014
Unknown," Turn your brain off and you should enjoy it
","UNKNOWN, another one of recent action star Liam Neeson's winter season offerings, is fairly entertaining, but also very implausible. Liam Neeson plays Martin Harris, a scientist who is attending a biotech conference in Berlin with his wife. Or is he? After an accident, he is left with no identification and no proof of who he is, and everyone is claiming they don't know him. He then proceeds to find out who he is. This type of mystery/thriller has been done before, although perhaps not as slickly as this one. The movie ERASED, starring Aaron Eckhart comes to mind, although that pales in comparison to this in terms of just about everything. Liam Neeson once again shows that he makes a capable, if unexpected, action star and he also has the acting chops to give it some weight. January Jones as his wife, however, is practically a non-entity. She practically sleepwalks through her limited role and doesn't really give off anything resembling human emotion, although that might have been on purpose. To accurately describe my reasoning would delve into spoiler territory, so I'll just leave it at that. Diane Kruger also gave a good performance as an immigrant taxi driver who helps out Liam Neeson's character. Aside from him, she's given the most screen time and is given a nice back story, to boot. Rounding out the cast are Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. Although neither one of them had a lot of screen time (one might say they were underutilized), they did own the few scenes they were in. In terms of technical quality, the film was decent. There was a fair amount of hand-held camera-work, but none of it was too 'shaky' and the fight scenes were comprehensible. There was even a couple good car chases. There was also some nice on-location shooting in Berlin, although the visual palette of the film didn't really bring out anything spectacular. Narrative-wise, the film is preposterous but still fun. There was a couple of moments where I laughed out loud due to how ridiculous things were, but overall I just accepted that the whole premise was far-fetched and went with it. Now, being mostly a dumb action movie, you wouldn't expect it to have much in the way of pertinent themes or sociopolitical commentary, but they did manage to shoehorn some in via Bruno Ganz's character, a former Stasi agent and a Saudi prince who is bankrolling a GMO project. Nothing too deep is said, but it was nice that they acknowledged that these things exist. As a whole, the movie is OK. It moves along at a good pace and is never boring. Still, discerning moviegoers would be justified in skipping it if they don't like this brand of action movie.",7,1,1,14 November 2014
Ghostbusters," Who ya gonna call?
","Another movie I've been missing out on...until now! This movie is just hilarious, with everyone giving a terrific performance. The main cast of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are great together and Rick Moranis is awesomely funny in a smaller role as a nerdy accountant who lives in the same apartment building as Sigourney Weaver. On Sigourney Weaver: there was nothing particularly bad about her performance, but she did seem a little underwritten. There was one great scene she had with Bill Murray after she gets possessed, but other than that she was merely a plot device/damsel in distress. Moving on to other facets of the production, I thought the soundtrack was top-notch, cheesy 80's goodness and the title song was especially memorable and catchy. Visual effects is one area where I felt the film to be a bit lacking, although it probably was some of the best effects the early 80's had to offer. In my opinion, the animatronics and claymation/stop-motion work was better than some early CG. This especially becomes apparent in the ridiculously convoluted final act, and is preceded by a hastily (but hilariously) resolved conflict with an EPA agent. Other than, I didn't really see any major problems with the writing. It just seemed like the scope of the film could have stayed smaller towards the end and been just as enjoyable. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the film a lot and am now 'in the know' about a film that has left an indelible mark on pop culture. So, who ya gonna call? I know who I would...Ghostbusters!",9,4,6,14 November 2014
The Hurt Locker," A solidly made modern war film
","THE HURT LOCKER is a tense but emotionally distant war film from director Kathryn Bigelow, and starring Jeremy Renner. It follows an Army bomb disposal unit around as they do their job in war-torn Iraq. Unlike most war films it doesn't really take a stance on whether or not we should even be there, instead focusing on the psychology of warfare and what it does to the human mind. I thought that this approach mostly worked, although it kept the audience at a certain distance emotionally from the characters. The main character is played by Jeremy Renner, and he is the sergeant in charge of the unit. He is brash, reckless and one could almost say he has a death wish. What is closer to the truth is that he just loves what he does, and the thrill he gets from doing it. Also in his unit are another sergeant and a specialist played by Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty, respectively. They serve as counterpoint to Renner's character, and as a rational check against his unbridled nature. While most of the film deals with their bomb-defusing exploits, there are some moments when the true ugliness of the Iraq War shows its face, such as a tense nighttime scene in which Renner's character stalks someone he thinks is responsible for the death of a young street vendor he met. He ends up in the wrong place and just leaves before the situation escalates. It is in moments like that where the film hints at a possibly deeper reading of the film in terms of whether we should have even been in Iraq in the first place. That being said, the film is well-acted by everyone involved and the hand-held cinematography worked in its favor, putting the viewer into the heat of the situations that arose. I guess my biggest gripe would be that it never explicitly challenges American presence in Iraq, but it's not necessarily a film's job to do that for you. With what it portrayed, and who the main character was, it still allows you to draw your own conclusions. For one, it must take a special someone to be a bomb disposal expert. And also, not everyone is cut out for combat. Overall, THE HURT LOCKER is a solid piece of filmmaking and an interesting look into modern warfare.",8,0,1,7 February 2015
Moulin Rouge!," Shakespeare by way of SHOWGIRLS
","MOULIN ROUGE seems like one of those movies that you either love or hate, mostly because of Baz Luhrmann's style. I actually don't mind his style that much, having enjoyed Australia and, to a lesser degree, THE GREAT GATSBY. Still, I wasn't even ten minutes into this and my head was already spinning. Thankfully, he doesn't keep the visual intensity cranked up to eleven the entire time, but a lot of time was spent in a hyperactive mode that gave me somewhat of a headache, while also laughing at the near-constant absurdity of what I was watching. If I had to describe it, and there are a number of ways to do so, it was like a fever dream or a roller-coaster that is perpetually on a downward course: exhilarating but also exhausting. The plot seemed almost an afterthought, with every romantic cliché of the last 600 years or so being stuffed into a story of tragically doomed romance that was probably old hat when Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. The acting, from an admittedly impressive roster of talented actors, was so over-the-top that it put primetime soap operas to shame. Just to give one example, John Leguizamo (as Toulouse-Lautrec?) sounded like Elmer Fudd with a lisp. Hopefully they had fun making this because I'd be ashamed to have this on my resume. Anyhow, acting and story aside, MOULIN ROUGE is a rather inventive (if derivative) movie. I would have never thought to set a musical in turn-of-the-century France yet use modern pop songs. The way in which they weave dozens of them in the dialogue is almost comical at times, but it worked for the most part. Where the film really shone, though, was the production design, sets and costumes. Other than paying the actors, this is probably where the most money was lavished, and it showed. Although confined to a few constructed sets, they were gorgeously realized and popping with detail. I don't know how this movie fared at the 2002 Oscars, but it probably got some well-deserved technical awards. Overall, MOULIN ROUGE was rather overwhelming, as if in a constant absinthe-induced delirium partially achieved through rapid-fire editing which gave it the feel of a two-hour music video. Still, Baz Luhrmann's commitment to overdoing every production element has some limited rewards and those are really what makes this worth watching, if only once.",5,1,2,28 February 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Didn't Sony learn their lesson from Spider-Man 3?
","While I wasn't initially excited about having this franchise rebooted so soon, I did enjoy THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN even if it did rehash the same old origin story that fans are all too familiar with. Here, the sequel is bigger but not quite to its advantage. First off, I'll say that Andrew Garfield is excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Even if he's not quite an awkward, geeky character, he at least has the wisecracking down to a 't.' Emma Stone also does an excellent job as Gwen Stacy. And the relationship between her and Peter is done rather well. In general, the cast gives good performances, with a couple of big exceptions though. The special effects are also top-notch, and Electro has a few scenes to show off his powers that really impressed me, even on my laptop.However, the area where this film falls short is the script. I'm no fan of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and they deliver an overstuffed narrative that tries to juggle too many characters and subplots, to the point where several of them feel shoehorned in as fan service. For this film to have been effective, Electro should have been the sole villain. You would have thought that Sony learned their lesson with Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 3, but they obviously didn't. Green Goblin's introduction (and one of its consequences) feels rushed and tacked on to the end, while Rhino was completely superfluous. And to make matters worse, Paul Giamatti completely hams it up in the worst way possible.To touch on a couple other things, the plot is so unwieldy that certain scenes stick out as the contrivances they are, merely excuses for characters to meet and exchange information, or for exposition. Overall, this movie's greatest sin is that it tried to do too much and as a result it was a good half-hour too long. Certain characters and subplots could have been left out so that more time could be devoted to fleshing out the main story. In the end, what you're left with is a visually impressive comic book movie that feels like a stepping stone to something else, in this case a Sinister Six movie. If you're a fan of these movies, or the Spider-Man character, just go ahead and see it if you haven't already. For everyone else, just stick to Sam Raimi's trilogy.",6,3,10,14 November 2014
Ex Machina," Highly engaging on an intellectual level
","Amidst a glut of AI-themed films in the past year, EX MACHINA is destined to stand out for what it does differently, and arguably better. While other films might be content to broach interesting questions in theory, they often lose focus by an over-reliance on visual effects and visceral action. This film strips much of that away and engages those interesting questions, often at the expense of emotional impact, but clearly aware of the implications of the subjects it addresses. The setup for the story is quite simple: a programmer (Domnhall Gleeson) for a large tech company is invited to the CEO's (Oscar Isaac) residence/research facility to perform a Turing Test on an AI he has created. From there, as director/writer Alex Garland says (or, at least pretty close), a small group of individuals are 'put in a confined location, the screws are turned, and we see what happens.' The central themes of human interaction and what it ultimately means to be human are key here, and addressed in an intelligent way with dialogue that sounds true-to-life. Although Domnhall Gleeson is essentially a stand-in for the audience, I found Oscar Isaac's character to be the most interesting. He was just so down-to-earth and personable, even as it becomes apparent that his motives might not be so altruistic. This leads to a sub-theme of manipulation, as each character manipulates and is manipulated by each other. There is even a brief scene which could lead to discussion about surveillance and the 'internet of things,' insofar as these large companies like Google have unprecedented access to our data and lives in general. Like all films of this caliber, there aren't really any answers given, but that really isn't the point. It's there to stimulate the mind and invite discussion. However, this means that it won't be to everyone's taste. The pacing is very deliberate and will probably bore some people. Also of concern/interest is the ending, which will likely divide even those who like the film. I thought it was shocking enough, but still anti-climactic in a way. Beyond the writing and performances, which were all excellent, the technical aspects of the film were equally impressive. I liked how the production design and cinematography worked together to create a sterile environment that you can take in with slow, deliberate camera movement and artfully composed shots that have perfect lighting. Even the robot effects were very well-done for something this modestly budgeted. If there's any complaint I have it's that the film, with a few exceptions, is as emotionally sterile as the controlled environment in which it takes place. I wish it had engaged a little more than just my brain. Still, all things considered, EX MACHINA is destined to become a sci-fi classic. It has intellectual themes and drama in a gradually intensifying situation, a great cast, and it looks great. What more could you ask for?",8,1,4,18 July 2015
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," A stale and boring rehash of the first one
","More of the same from terminally awkward teenager Bella Swan, and unfortunately this time it starts to wear out its welcome. That's not to say it's all bad, though. Some positives include improved cinematography and a good soundtrack. The cast also seems more comfortable in their roles this time, although the peripheral cast is woefully underwritten and seems to be there just to pad out the story/run time. This time around, Edward leaves Bella for her protection almost as quickly as they got together in the first one. This leaves more time allocated to supporting character Jacob Black, which wasn't a good thing. Taylor Lautner isn't as good of an actor as Robert Pattinson, and he lacks the (limited) charisma that Pattinson brings to his role as a 109-year-old vampire. Another positive element is several self-aware pop culture references and jabs at the nature of the story itself. But a few funny moments do not a good movie make. The story has some major pacing issues, jumping right into the story but then slowing down to a crawl as Jacob and Bella spend more time with each other. Also, in this installment, the audience is introduced (rather unceremoniously) to the Volturi, who seem to be some kind of vampire 'elitists'. After an offhanded reference early on (which does have a cool sequence of a vampire being ripped limb from limb), they aren't seen until the obligatory climax which this time involves Edward threatening to expose himself for what he is. One minute, Bella's in Forks reuniting with Alice and the next, she's whisked off to Italy to save Edward from getting himself killed. It all just happens so fast and without much aforethought. One positive thing I did get from this rushed final act was Michael Sheen, who plays the Volturi leader. He brings a certain elegant sleaziness to the role which I liked. He also seemed to be having fun with the ludicrous material he was given. After this sequence, the movie ends on one of the most ridiculous cliffhangers I've seen in recent memory. Overall, the movie doesn't cover any new dramatic territory, which results in it being stale and boring at times. However, the filmmaking quality was improved, even it just amounted to polishing a turd.",4,4,6,13 November 2014
Transformers," Still the best of the series
","This is where it all started: where big-budget blockbusters started to dumb down at a higher rate, and where Michael Bay's career started to coalesce into the cynical (but very profitable) mess it is today. That being said, TRANSFORMERS is still rather entertaining if you take if for what it is. The plot is as convoluted as expected, yet probably the simplest one in the series. The Autobots must find the Allspark before the Decepticons do, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is an integral part in helping them. Aside from that, you have Michael Bay's usual fixation with military hardware, hot models, cool cars, and 'splosions. He really does have a distinct style in his body of work, for better or worse. Watching it for the second or third time, all I could really think about was how unfunny the humor was, and how the camera-work was headache-inducing. Yet, this first Transformers movie remains watchable if for no other reason than that I know the quality is all downhill from here. The acting is decent, for the most part. The visual effects still hold up really well, even if most of the robot action is obfuscated with clever camera angles and 'shaky cam.' Slow motion is really the only time the viewer is given the opportunity to take in some of the best visual moments. The score is also decent and doesn't really get in the way. When it comes down to it, I don't like this as much as I may have the first time, but it still entertained me. Occasionally, something that speaks to one's inner 12-year-old can be fun, and that's basically what TRANSFORMERS is.",6,2,2,5 July 2015
Million Dollar Baby," Three excellent central performances elevate a clichéd story
","Clint Eastwood must have gotten soft in his old age. While this isn't necessarily a criticism, MILLION DOLLAR BABY walks a fine line between emotionally powerful drama and sappy, overly sentimental melodrama. Fortunately despite the predictable plotting and cliché dialogue, it has a trio of excellent performances that keep it out of the kitchen sink. Front and center is Hilary Swank as Maggie, a down-on-her-luck waitress who aspires to be a boxer. Her performance is what really makes the film work due to her irrepressible spirit and down-home charm. Clint Eastwood also does an admirable job as Frankie Dunn, who reluctantly ('I don't train girls') takes a role as Maggie's trainer, manager, and mentor. And then there's Morgan Freeman, one of Frankie's former fighters, and who also co-runs a gym with him. I will admit that his presence in the film adds some depth as he is a connection to Frankie's past, but I didn't feel like he was integral to the story. Still, he had one of the film's best scenes when he shows that despite losing an eye (and being old), that he still has 'it' in the ring. Beyond these three central performances, the film seems content to stick to the tired sports movie formula of having a older mentor train a younger up-and-comer, at least for the first 3/4. Despite the film having been out now for over 10 years, I still won't give away the sharp turn the story takes. At that point the film becomes something else which is more obviously heavy-handed and didn't quite work for me. It also doesn't help that the film strongly hints at the outcome very early on, robbing it of a lot of the emotional impact. And that is actually my biggest problem with the film. Not content to let the performances and story stand on their own, Paul Haggis (a producer/co-writer) insists on holding the audience's hand throughout the entire film. It didn't work for me in CRASH, and didn't really work for me here either. Still, Clint Eastwood manages to elevate the material to the point where I didn't hate myself for watching it. Overall, the three central performances are enough to loosely recommend this film, but just be aware that it is somewhat heavy-handed and relies a little too much on genre clichés.",6,1,1,24 March 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel's best so far? No, but still incredibly enjoyable
","First off, I don't read comic books, but I am at least nominally familiar with a lot of the Marvel characters. That being said, I had no idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy were. To a degree, after seeing this, I still don't completely understand since they don't really go into a lot of character depth but I am interested in going back to this world and exploring these characters again. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY has eye-popping visuals, an incredible soundtrack and some legitimately good world-building that manage to transcend a rather run-of-the-mill story. The basic plot is that these five characters, who are all outcasts in their own way, are thrust together through circumstance and unite to overcome a villain bent on destroying a planet. Those characters are Peter Quill/Starlord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel).The best elements of the film which stuck out to me were the outstanding visual effects, world-building and character design. There are a lot of things thrown in together, and despite the enormity of it all, I never felt overwhelmed. Also, the action sequences were well-shot and there some truly amazing space battles. The performances, however, are more of a mixed bag. First, I will say that Chris Pratt was amazing as Peter Quill. He brought an everyman quality to his character and had a great sense of humor. Rocket and Groot were also great characters to watch in every scene they appeared. I'd go so far as to say they were my favorite characters. They were equal parts cute and badass, and have some of the best lines and most poignant scenes in the whole movie.On the other end, though, I thought that Dave Bautista and Karen Gillan (as Nebula) weren't at the same level as other members of the cast. And then there were other characters who barely registered because they just weren't in the movie that much. Thanos is one of these, and I also didn't like Josh Brolin's voice-over. You also have John C. Reilly and Glenn Close who show up for a few scenes. Sadly, the main villain Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) was just as weak a villain as any other villain in a Marvel film. That's not to say that Lee Pace didn't do a good job or that the character didn't look cool, but he just wasn't given enough to do.On a more positive note, the soundtrack was amazing. Kind of makes me want to buy a copy of Awesome Mix Vol. 1. And, for all of the lack of originality in the story, it was executed in an interesting way and elevated by the chemistry of the core cast members. I wouldn't say that it's the best Marvel movie to date, but it certainly is the most 'out of the box' and daring thing that they've attempted so far.",8,0,3,13 December 2014
The Imitation Game," Fascinating history and an excellent performance by Cumberbatch, despite otherwise being a traditional biopic
","THE IMITATION GAME tells the story of how Alan Turing helped to break the Nazi Enigma code during WWII, turning the tide in favor of the Allies. It also provides some insight into his troubled personal life. I suppose the biggest theme in the film is that of secrets, be they government/military or personal. While I thought that the parallels drawn between Turing's work and life were a bit broad and obvious, it still made for a compelling story, and certainly one that needed to be told. Far and away, Benedict Cumberbatch is the best reason (among many) to see this film. His performance was extraordinary, and certainly his best work outside of SHERLOCK. Even though Turing was probably somewhere on the autism spectrum, there was considerable emotional weight to this portrayal, particularly in the final scenes which go into the terrible thing which happens to him as a consequence of his homosexuality. As far as prestige biopics go, nothing in the film's content or construction goes out of its way to stand out. The plot structure, which hops back and forth to different periods in Turing's life was a bit passé, although nothing felt superfluous or out of place. And of course, the main part of the story which focuses on Turing's work breaking the Enigma code was fascinating to watch, not just for the dramatic tension that came from trying to win the war, but also through the personal relationships that formed as Turing and his team spend more and more time together. And for once, I didn't dislike Keira Knightley in her native accent. From a technical standpoint, the film is well put-together with good, if unspectacular, cinematography and editing. The score by Alexandre Desplat was also well-done and noninvasive. The only issue I feel detracts from the film in the slightest is the on-the-nose screenplay by Graham Moore, which almost oversells Alan Turing's importance and draws some rather obvious parallels between his secret government work and secret life. Still, the story told here is a very important one nonetheless and allows an enigmatic historical figure some due respect. While this isn't a revolutionary step forward as far as biopics go, it sheds some light on recently declassified history that will prove interesting to most.",8,0,1,29 April 2015
Caddyshack," Has a fair amount of laugh-worthy moments despite being slightly dull and unfocused
","CADDYSHACK is yet another movie that everyone else but me has seen until now (apparently). It's directed by Harold Ramis and features Bill Murray and Chevy Chase in their prime, along with Rodney Dangerfield. Why wouldn't it be good? Well, if 90 minutes of improvisation with little to no plot is your idea of good comedy (and considering comedies these days, there are a lot of people who feel that way), then you'll feel right at home. For me, there were a number of individually funny bits from each of the main cast members, but the unfocused, episodic nature of the story kept me from being invested too much in the goings-on at this snooty country club. The best running gag is one that everyone is probably familiar with: Bill Murray and the gopher. But it was only funny in and of itself, feeling mostly tangential to the story (or to justify Bill Murray's presence). There was the potential to do a satire on class conflict, but Rodney Dangerfield threw a wrench in that (most of his bits didn't work for me at all). Chevy Chase got to do some of his shtick as well, but overall it felt like all the cast members were just trying to show each other up instead of being a real ensemble cast. I will say that the soundtrack, heavily featuring Kenny Loggins, was quite good though. Ultimately, I did laugh a handful of times but the script and its execution left a lot to be desired.",5,10,19,29 March 2016
Prisoners," A beautiful and brooding masterpiece
","PRISONERS is an intense, unforgettable look at how far people go to protect the ones they love. Excellent performances, beautiful cinematography and a haunting soundtrack combine to create one of the best films this year. The story is about two girls who are abducted, and the ensuing investigation. One of the parents (played by Hugh Jackman) is not satisfied with how the police are doing their job, and takes it upon himself to do some investigating of his own. What follows is a journey into the abyss and dark recesses of the human soul as the rules are bent (and broken) in an attempt to solve the mystery and find closure. I don't want to give anything else away, as that would severely reduce the emotional impact. This movie does what most can't, and maintains an almost unbearable level of tension throughout it's entire run time, which is about two and a half hours. Everyone of the leads is on their A-game, and bring such pathos to their characters that you can't help but identify and sympathize with them. Of course, who couldn't given the subject matter (unless you're a psychopath)? This is greatly enhanced by a lurking sense of dread conveyed brilliantly by the cinematography (courtesy of Roger Deakins, and deserving of an Oscar) and a haunting score. You just can't take your eyes off of the screen, and you'll never want to check your watch, it's that good. Overall, this is one of the best movies I've seen all year and I highly recommend you check it out...without kids present, preferably.",10,0,1,14 November 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A solid second outing for everyone's favorite superhero team
","When crafting a sequel to any movie, the goal is usually to make it bigger while still retaining the qualities that made people fall in love with the first one. On that alone, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON succeeds marvelously. While the action in THE AVENGERS was mostly confined to New York (at least the climax), ULTRON is more of a globe-hopping adventure. The banter between the team members is as funny as ever and, without the need to bring the team together this time, there was more time allotted to character development, particularly Hawkeye and Black Widow, who haven't had so much to do in the Marvel movies up to this point. Of course, with this expansion comes a handful of new characters to add to all the ones we're familiar with (and most of whom at least make a cameo). Chief among these is Ultron, a sneering villain whose personality is directly based on Stark's. There are also the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, who have a particular connection with Stark that sees them initially aligned with Ultron against the Avengers. To sum up all that's good with the film is quite easy: it's frickin' cool. A slightly more polished way to put this is that it delivers on the all of the witty repartee and CGI-enhanced action that we've come to expect from the MCU. However, there are a few points where it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. First, the novelty of having the team together has worn off a bit. Second, while the increase in locations is appreciated, the narrative is somewhat more splintered and unwieldy than it possibly should have been. A lot of this has to do with some scenes which are setting up future adventures. Another big part of this has to do with the final action set-piece basically being a redux of the Battle of New York from the first AVENGERS. And, while Ultron is great as the villain always ready with a quip, his motivation remained as opaque and vague as Scarlet Witch's powers (summed up as 'weird'). It boils down to not being as streamlined nor as unique as what came before it. Still, none of this really negatively impacted my enjoyment. I was as eager to return to this world as anyone, and Joss Whedon surely didn't disappoint me.",8,2,6,10 September 2015
"Girl, Interrupted"," We're all a little crazy sometimes
","Directed by James Mangold (COPLAND, THE WOLVERINE) and starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, GIRL INTERRUPTED is the adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir about her time spent in Claymoore for attempted suicide. While I do feel like it is a good film, if a little unspectacular or by-the-numbers, I've never liked Winona Ryder that much. She acquits herself nicely here, but her character is rather vanilla and bland, especially compared to the colorful cast of characters she meets while institutionalized. The most interesting (and most developed) of these is Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. While she might be better known as a movie star than as a serious actress these days, this performance came before all of that and, in my opinion, is one of her best. In fact, she gives the best performance in the entire film. In terms of thematic content, there are a lot of things said about insanity and mental health. Also, given the time period of 1967-1968, one could infer commentary on the state of America's mental institutions, especially as they applied to women. There's also some subtle commentary on the Vietnam War, although not to a great extent since that wasn't the main focus of the story. Whatever thematic goals the film may have had, however, pale in comparison to the character work and ensemble cast. As a portrait of life in a mental institution during the late 60's, I thought it was very effective, humorous and occasionally poignant. Brittany Murphy also had a small role as a character who is involved with one of the film's more serious moments. There are a couple more things that I thought about while watching this, one of them amusing and the other quite tragic. The first is a part of the film when Lisa and Susanna escape with the intention of going to Florida and getting jobs at the newly established Disney World. Lisa wants to be Cinderella, which is kind of funny considering that just last year Angelina Jolie played Maleficent for Disney. Not quite the same, but still interesting. The other, and which is a bit of a spoiler, is that Brittany Murphy would eventually meet a tragic end like her character in this film. Anyway, this wasn't some brilliant expose of mental institutions but it did function especially well as a character study. Winona Ryder's character was a bit bland, but only because she was completely upstaged by everyone around her. Recommended, but mostly for Angelina Jolie's performance.",7,2,2,15 February 2015
Men in Black," Highly entertaining and funny sci-fi/comedy
","I'm about 16 years late seeing this, and I saw the third one first (with no need for #2), but I must say that this is one of the most fun movie-watching experiences I've ever had. It was non-stop laughs and thrills from beginning to end. The element which stuck out to me as being done extraordinarily well was the writing, specifically the comic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Their characters are so different, and yet play off each other so well. Even the smaller parts were well-written and played. Of particular amusement to me was the largely physical performance given by Vincent D'Onofrio as the main bad bug. You can tell he gave it his all with his awkward speech patterns and movements. It really seemed like he was adjusting to a human body, and it was all done with a sly sense of humor. The only thing I find lacking was some dated CG, but considering it came out over 15 years ago, it was fine. If anything it adds to the B-movie charm, and some of alien design was probably influenced by 1950's 'Creature Features' anyway. All things considered, it was an absolutely incredible and enthralling viewing experience. It's just a shame I waited so long to check it out.",10,8,10,14 November 2014
Elysium," Entertaining sci-fi with a message
","While it doesn't quite live up to the high bar set by DISTRICT 9, ELYSIUM is a very entertaining sci-fi film with a message. Something that Neill Blomkamp does very well is create a believable world with interesting characters, and he does that here as well. The world in the film feels very realized and believable. Also, the special effects used to enhance it are very effective as well. The story is rather simple. Matt Damon's character, Max, gets a lethal dose of radiation and has to find a way to Elysium to get treatment. In this movie, the poor remain on Earth while the richest in society have migrated to a torus satellite called Elysium. However, some needless complications to the plot bring down the movie a little bit, most notably a coup d'etat subplot that feels shoehorned in to give Jodie Foster's character more to do. The movie also isn't very subtle in its messaging, practically hitting the viewer over the head with its plea for universal healthcare. Still, it's an admirable message, but one that could have been handled more deftly. Another thing that could have been improved was the central relationship between Max and his childhood friend, now a nurse whose daughter is dying from leukemia. Even though this has to be one of the biggest coincidences ever, it still works in the context of the story. Still, despite the over-complication in the plot, Elysium delivers an exciting story, with great action (although edited a little too chaotically) and a timely message.",7,0,0,14 November 2014
Taken," Liam Neeson sells this pedestrian but entertaining action thriller
","TAKEN is a simple action movie about a family man with 'a particular set of skills' who takes down a sex trafficking ring in order to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped while on holiday in Paris. While this could have gone straight to the bargain bin, what really sells this movie is Liam Neeson, who brings a everyman quality to his role as Bryan Mills. The production values by Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel are also worth noting, with just enough emotional content to make the story relatable and a kinetic style that keeps things moving along at a good pace. Generally speaking everyone gives a decent performance, but I thought that Maggie Grace was miscast as she doesn't look the part of a 17-year-old girl, and her acting is questionable at best. Story-wise, I did appreciate that the movie took time to establish characters and relationships before heading off into more standard action thriller territory but, that being said, it only taps into the basest of human emotions and tendencies. Only someone devoid of empathy wouldn't understand the sticky situation that the characters are put into. Still, despite the rote nature of the setup it works, and the latter two-thirds of the movie rarely let up. As far as the action is concerned, it is well-shot for the most part. Pierre Morel shoots the close quarters combat up close, but the editing isn't so bad that you can't tell who's fighting who, and the geography and shot compositions are decent. If there's one complaint I have in this area is a nighttime car chase which was perhaps a bit too chaotically shot/edited. Overall, this is a decent time-passer that has enough story and thrills to keep you interested, and the running time is only about 90 minutes so it never overstays it's welcome.",7,1,1,10 October 2014
This Is Spinal Tap," Comedy not quite at an '11'
","I honestly had no idea of what to expect with THIS IS SPINAL TAP, with the exception of a couple of bits that have entered the pop culture lexicon (the Marshall amp bit, for instance). What I got was...OK, I guess? It wasn't exactly a laugh-riot, but there were a number of recurring funny bits. Still, there were too many stretches that I didn't find funny at all. Fortunately, the songs were well-written and performed. Otherwise, I would have been mostly bored. Overall, it was a mixed bag in terms of comedy, although it did have a few amusing insights into the over-the-top-ness of rock bands. Maybe it would have been funnier if I'd been born 20 years earlier.",6,4,12,30 August 2016
Chariots of Fire," More intriguing as a dual character study than as a sports drama
","Continuing my streak of past Best Picture winners, I took the opportunity to watch (for the first time) CHARIOTS OF FIRE. While it's about as unchallenging and 'white bread' as you can get for this type of fare, it still remains an inspirational sports drama and character study that explores the reasons behind wanting to achieve greatness. The two points of comparison are Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), the former a British Jew and the latter a Scottish Christian. Both have intensely personal reasons for wanting to win the gold in the 1924 Olympics. Harold is in it for personal achievement as a way to transcend the anti-Semitism he experiences, while Eric runs for God. Although the film sets them up as rivals, they only ever compete against each other once, and not in the Olympics (they are in separate events). This actually works in the film's favor, though, as this allows the audience to root for the success of both. It goes without saying that the acting is all top-notch, and the cast contains a who's-who of famous British actors. Aside from the two leads, you have John Gielgud and Ian Holm in supporting roles as the Master of Trinity and Harold's coach, respectively. Then there's the iconic theme by Vangelis which is certain to inspire you. Even if this film isn't too well remembered, the theme music is, and it's one of the most stirring ever composed. There is also the excellent use of slow motion during the racing scenes. Although it's been parodied and spoofed dozens of times since, here it remains free of irony and is a brilliant way to showcase the physical form of the competitors. The only thing I can think of that really dampens the experience is how simplistic and 'safe' the film is. It's not really a surprise that the Academy chose it as the Best Picture for its year, but it could have explored its themes of patriotism and spirituality with a little more depth. The story itself was also very predictable (as sports dramas often are) and its resolution a foregone conclusion. Still, what really makes the film worth watching is what happens in between, the journey to the Olympics that its two leads embark upon. Overall, it's not necessarily the best sports movie I've ever seen (nor the most memorable), but it's a wholesome and endearing film that should appeal to all ages.",7,1,1,7 March 2015
Frank," A quirky combination of indie music and mental illness
","I wasn't sure what to expect from FRANK, although the trailers I saw for it definitely piqued my interest with what seemed to be a quirky, fish-out-of-water story. For what it's worth, that is what the film is initially. However, and I'll be as vague as possible to avoid spoiling anything, it ends up being a potent examination of mental illness that was quite touching. Domnhall Gleeson plays Jon, an aspiring musician who joins a band led by a mysterious man, Frank (Michael Fassbender), who always wears a giant papier-mache head over his own. Together, they journey out into the country to record an album and, eventually (due to Jon's constant stream of social media information) go to Texas to play SXSW. While that might describe the skeleton of the plot, what really makes this worth watching is the idiosyncrasies and quirks of the main characters, their humorous interactions and antics, and Jon's desperate attempt to make himself feel like a part of the group. You really get a sense of him as an outsider, although the people he surrounds himself with are probably even more societal outsiders than he is. The music they make isn't mainstream by any means. In fact, it's completely removed from that: it comes from the soul. I didn't particularly care for a lot of it, since it came off sometimes as being weird for weird's sake, but the conviction with which it is played and the enthusiasm of the band playing it makes it tolerable, even endearing. Everyone gives an excellent performance, especially Michael Fassbender who is able to make his character work despite having his head covered for most of the movie. Domnhall Gleeson is good too, but I would like to give special mention to Maggie Gyllenhaal. She was hilariously weird in parts, and other times deadly serious, but overall you got a good sense that she cared for Frank. Scoot McNairy also has a small-ish role, and he was decent as well. Overall, I like this film a lot despite not caring for the music in it. This is one of the best films I've seen this year and I would highly recommend others to see it as well.",8,0,1,29 October 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The best of the series, which isn't saying too much
","This, by far, is the best of the series although it's unfortunate that it waited this long to get 'good' (using that term loosely). However, it is nice that it went out on a high note. Bill Condon really did a nice job with these last two installments, and it shows in everything from the camera-work to the set design. It really is a pretty film to look at. However, the biggest problem outside of the obvious ones is the pacing, particularly that the slower portions of the film move so slowly. It's like they're teasing the audience to the point where you just want the climactic battle to happen and end it all. Thankfully, that moment comes. And then it's taken back in a flash. Had to be one of most frustrating moments I've ever experienced in a movie, although what preceded it was cool. After that forced happy resolution, the movie moves into sentimental territory, and it least this time it felt a little more genuine. Bella was better as a vampire than she ever was as a human, and there are some really funny moments early on where she gets angry. There weren't as many unintentionally hilarious moments this time around, but it's nice that they were still there. I also liked the soundtrack, which was good as usual. In particular, I like the closing song by Christina Perri. Overall, despite the frustrating imaginary battle, it was the perfect conclusion to this so-so franchise. Everyone lives happily ever after. The End.",6,3,9,13 November 2014
Love & Mercy," Brian Wilson: genius or madman?
","I don't think I've ever seen a biopic quite like LOVE & MERCY before, and I'm still processing what I've seen, to be honest. Focusing on two time periods in Brian Wilson's life, it explores the Beach Boys' heyday in the 1960's (with Paul Dano) and a low period in the 1980's (with John Cusack) during which he meets his second wife, Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), who helps him out of his precarious situation with Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), a psychologist who is very controlling of his personal life. Unlike GET ON UP, the James Brown biopic from last year that followed a stream-of-consciousness approach to narrative structure, LOVE & MERCY is very linear. The two timelines do kind of fade into one another, but the end goal of Brian Wilson's rehabilitation is always front and center. The best aspect of the film is dual performance by Paul Dano and John Cusack as Brian Wilson. Although they each play him differently, due to the different circumstances in those periods of Brian Wilson's life, they still felt like the same person. Paul Dano gets the showier performance, but John Cusack still does excellent work as the heavily medicated Wilson of the 1980's. And, both of them accurately portray the loneliness and isolation that Wilson must have felt. The supporting cast do just as good, though. Paul Giamatti was suitably slimy as the Eugene Landy, the psychologist who takes advantage of Brian Wilson in his weak state, and Elizabeth Banks was very charming and grounded as Melinda Ledbetter, the woman who finally rescues Brian from the prison that his life became. From a technical standpoint, LOVE & MERCY is very competent, with occasional flashes of brilliance. One particularly memorable shot was a long take around a recording studio as Brian is instructing two cellists on the sound he wants them to make. There were also a couple similar shots in Brian's Malibu home (in the 1980's period). There was also a few sequences where the footage was degraded to look like it was recorded a long time ago, which I thought was creative. Then, there's the music. It's been a long time since I've actually listened to the Beach Boys, but it was refreshing to hear it. The score by Atticus Ross was also quite good, its sparseness capturing, again, the loneliness and isolation in Brian Wilson's head. If there's anything negative I have to say, it's that there are some sporadic pacing issues, but nothing so egregious as to make the film unwatchable. Besides, the ending was rather satisfying anyway. Overall, LOVE & MERCY was a uniquely structured psychological portrait in lieu of the typical biography, and it should be commended for that, in addition to the excellent performances and music. As to whether or not he was a genius or madman, I guess there's a little of both (but mostly genius, in my opinion).",8,1,3,4 October 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," Spectacular animation + emotionally resonant story = pure enjoyment
","Here's yet another great film that I missed the boat on initially. I typically stay away from kid's movies (save classic Disney) because they tend to be overly simplistic bores that would only entertain the youngest of children. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is one of best of the lot, however, because of its excellent animation and a compelling story with themes that will resonate with viewers of all ages. The movie takes place in an indeterminate time period when Vikings and dragons coexisted, although not peacefully as the beginning makes perfectly clear. They're mortal enemies, in fact, and Vikings train from a very young age to be able to kill the beasts who raid their village and steal their livestock. Everyone, that is, except Hiccup. Hiccup is what you could call an outcast or a reject. He wants to join his peers in training, but nobody ever seems to want to give him a chance. Fortunately, he gets one, though not in the way you'd expect. As the title indicates, there is some dragon training that goes down, but not without a serious paradigm shift. At its core, this movie is about a young boy who doesn't quite fit in, yet finds a way to make himself valuable to the people around him. There is also a subtext about learning to empathize and/or come to terms with things that we don't understand, and therefore fear. Both of these messages are very pertinent to people, young and old, and are dealt with in a mature, yet accessible way. For the kids, you have the spectacle of expertly animated flying sequences and a killer battle with the big-bad dragon. For adults (and more discerning children), you have the meatier stuff about acceptance and overcoming your fears. It's really one of the best animated films I've ever seen, on multiple levels. While DreamWorks might have made their name with Shrek, I think that this will have a bit more staying power in years to come. In fact, this is so good that it pains me to even gripe about a single thing, so I'll make it brief. The setup of the movie is a bit roughly handled, and the characters (initially) aren't really given their due. But the movie improves drastically as it progresses, so much so that you almost forget the slightly weak first act. Overall, this is a movie I see myself watching again and again, and I'll definitely be checking out the sequel. Do yourself a favor and go watch this right now. You'll be glad you did.",9,2,3,14 November 2014
Sicario," An excellent examination of the morally foggy 'War on Drugs'
","How far we should go in prosecuting the drug war is the main concern of SICARIO, the latest directorial effort by Denis Villeneuve. The violence brought about by America's war on drugs is a sensitive one because of the complex motives and casualties on both sides. This film doesn't really offer any answers, but it does provide enough to mentally chew on as the morally gray areas inherent in such an effort are explored. The audience's surrogate is Kate (Emily Blunt), an FBI agent who volunteers for an inter-agency task force that takes her into the heart of Mexico with the goal of finding a top boss in the cartel. Along for the mission is a mysterious person, Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), whose allegiance and motives are unclear (at first). If there's one weakness in the film, it's Emily Blunt's character, unfortunately. While she and her FBI partner provide the bulk of the dramatic conflict, she never really develops satisfactorily, instead relegated to a mostly passive observer. Benicio del Toro's character is by far the most interesting and compelling, and he get most of the best moments and dialogue. From a technical standpoint, SICARIO compares well with Villeneuve's other work and features outstanding cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins (who also worked on PRISONERS). Slow and deliberate camera-work nicely complements the slow-burn pacing, which culminates in one of the tensest (and morally ambiguous) scenes in recent memory. If there's one thing that this film does extremely well, it shows that the drug war has far-reaching effects from the top of the food chain down to a cop who is just trying to provide for his family (even if it is on the wrong side of the law). I should also mention the excellent score by Johann Johannsson, although a key element of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's style. If I had seen this last year, it most certainly would have made my top ten. As it stands, it further establishes Denis Villeneuve as a talent to be reckoned with and is suitably entertaining to boot.",9,1,2,24 January 2016
The Descent," A tense, thrilling, and claustrophobic survival horror film
","THE DESCENT is a movie I let sit in my video library for a while before actually watching it. Not because I was scared to, but mostly because I wasn't sure if it would be as good as I'd heard. Thankfully, my fears were assuaged when this turned out to be an effectively creepy and claustrophobic horror film. I'm not particularly scared of confined spaces but I can sympathize with those who are, and this film does a great job of creating an maintaining such an atmosphere for most of its running time. The basic plot is about these six women who go on a spelunking trip in the Appalachians. As a group, they've gone on similar adventures before, but nothing quite like this. As they get farther into the cave and deeper underground they are pushed to their limits and their sanity is tested, as well as their bond of friendship. They also discover that they may not be alone. Or are they?Generally speaking, the acting was sound and the characters were believable as a group of friends. There wasn't too much in the way of character development, but they were established well enough in the beginning that once things started to go south you cared about what happened to them. Of the six friends, only one is really given a back story, namely that her husband was killed in a freak accident after water rafting trip with a couple of her friends (who are in the main group). Her mental state is actually very important to the story, but in a way that I'll save for whoever wants to watch the film.Other aspects of the film that I thought very well-done were the cinematography, lighting and use of space. A lot of the film takes place in a cave underground, and it made good use of natural and artificial light to create a dark and mysterious atmosphere that kept you involved in what you were watching. You often get the sense that something could come out of the shadows at any moment and, in fact, there were a number of jump scares that utilized this very effectively. Although somewhat predictable in this regard, I didn't think they were overused and were germane to the story being told. Also, considering that this is a Neil Marshall film, the gore effects were well done and suitably gross.However, I do have a couple issues with the film as well. First, the score, while appropriate and engaging, was a little too insistent in parts. I don't really like when a film's music telegraphs how you're supposed to feel in a particular moment, and the music here gets used like that occasionally. With such a dark and claustrophobic film, I thought it would have been more effective to dial back the score a bit and let the scenes breathe a little on their own, creating a more natural sense of terror rather than inflating it with somewhat overblown instrumentation. I also thought that the story and character development could have been a bit more substantive. Instead of being rich and layered, it was minimal but effective.Overall, despite my misgivings about the score and thin plotting, I rather enjoyed this film. It's most effective at establishing an maintaining a tense mood and claustrophobic atmosphere that really works. At no point was I ever bored, although I would scratch my head at some of the stupid things that the main characters would do. But what horror film doesn't have characters who make ill-informed decisions at one point or another? What I got out of it what is a tense and thrilling survival horror with strong (but loosely defined) female characters and their descent into madness (the title works as a double-entendre). Highly recommended for genre fans.",7,1,3,5 November 2014
Zombieland," Should have seen it earlier -- might have liked it more
","I feel like I came to this a little late. I was never crazy about zombie movies, and now not so much about Jesse Eisenberg although his performances in THE SOCIAL NETWORK and THE DOUBLE were incredible. Sadly, although peppered with enough humor to keep me interested, the thin story left a lot to be desired. The basic plot is 'zombie apocalypse...yada yada...a group of people has to survive.' Whatever. What else would you in that situation? What I didn't like was how aimless the narrative was. There were a number of laugh-out-loud moments, most courtesy of Woody Harrelson, but they felt strung together in an episodic fashion. The only time where the narrative felt cohesive and 'about something' was the climactic battle in an amusement park. And even then, it just felt like a concentrated version of the crazy stuff we'd been getting in more measured doses up until that point. The film is also surprisingly short on zombie action until that sequence. The only detour that felt 'worth it' was a visit to a certain celebrity's house (even now, I won't spoil it for those who may not have seen the film yet). Even though the sequence was just an excuse for an extended cameo, it was funny enough that I didn't care. When it comes down to it, even though ZOMBIELAND is fairly short at 85 minutes, there was still the palpable feeling of being padded and occasionally directionless, despite the gonzo, post-modern approach to the genre.",6,0,1,6 May 2016
Psycho," 'A boy's best friend is his mother.'
","SPOILER ALERT: Norman Bates committed the murders. PSYCHO has been around for over 50 years, and if you haven't seen it by now it's your own fault. Of course, it's been several years since I first saw it and, going through a Hitchcock marathon, I thought it would be an appropriate time to revisit it. My only memories of seeing it the first time are wondering what the big deal was. However, now having seen many films since then (including several more Hitchcock pictures), it seems even better to me the second time around. This is in large part thanks to the Bernard Herrmann's score, which punctuates all the right moments and backs off when necessary. The first thing other than the main theme that people will probably think of is the celebrated shower scene, but this time the moments where the score takes a back seat, or goes away entirely, stood out more. In particular, the scene where Norman and Marion have dinner in his parlor came off as extremely creepy, and the way in which Norman's demeanor changes within that scene was nothing short of amazing. Also, in contrast to NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO has a rear-projected driving scene which actually worked for me. Again, a lot of this has to do with the score, but Janet Leigh's facial expressions and reactions to what goes on around her helped just as much to make it work. What also makes this film stand out from a lot of Hitchcock's other pictures was the conscious artistic choice to shoot in black and white. Although he said it would have been too gory to shoot in color, it gives the film a distinct griminess that stands in contrast to the high glamour of his other work. PSYCHO is decidedly unglamorous, and it succeeds because it fits with the subject matter. Lastly, Hitchcock is notorious for playing with audience expectations, and PSYCHO contains perhaps his greatest cinematic joke: the (apparent heroine) is killed off nearly halfway in to the film. Now her death does provide the dramatic momentum for the rest of it, but I can only imagine how audiences 1960 would have been shocked by this twist. In terms of his overall corpus (at least what I've seen so far), I'd put it up there with REAR WINDOW and NORTH BY NORTHWEST just shy of VERTIGO. The only thing that brings it down a peg is some needless psychoanalysis in the last scene. For me, it would have been more powerful to cut most of that out and skip to the chilling final shot that gradually zooms in on Anthony Perkins' face. Still, even with that scene, PSYCHO is definitely one of Hitchcock's finest, and laid the groundwork for the next generation of horror films.",9,0,1,11 August 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bigger, louder, and...pretty awful
","If the first Transformers movie was passable, this one comes up short of the low standards set by its predecessor. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN has bigger action setpieces, but at the expense of a coherent script, likable characters and a general reason to give a crap about anything that happens. If all you care about are action sequences with hunks of metal duking it out, you'll be in heaven. I was not. My sole memory of seeing this in theaters was leaving with a headache. While I didn't have the same experience watching it on Blu-ray some five years later, a lot of what is wrong with this film stuck out to me even more. Since the AllSpark from the previous entry is all but destroyed, they had to come up with a new MacGuffin. They came up with Energon and something called the Matrix of Leadership, which is as ill-defined as the AllSpark was, except that there's more pointless backstory and exposition to go with it. Another thing that got more screen-time was Michael Bay's unique sense of 'humor.' We're treated to two Autobots who are vaguely racist caricatures as well as an abundance of sexual humor that falls flat most of the time. And more exposition. And military porn. And things hitting other things in slo-mo. There is literally nothing to admire about this movie other than some great scenery, landscape shots and (admittedly) jaw-dropping visual effects. This movie is about Transformers, but the most succinct plot description is 'Guy finally says 'I love you' to his girlfriend.' Pathetic. This movie is pure eye candy, to be sure, but it's the kind that you can break your teeth on if you aren't careful.",4,0,4,5 July 2015
The Witch," An unnerving, surreal descent into religious paranoia
","THE WITCH is, in a word, unsettling. Horror films don't normally have an effect on me, much less scare me, but this one was unnerving in a very palpable way. It's about a Puritan family who are banished from their village for an unspecified religious offense, and subsequently move to a location bordering a forest. While there, repeated misfortune and isolation create the perfect storm of religious paranoia over whether one or more of them are possessed by the devil. What THE WITCH masterfully does is to create this tense atmosphere and maintain it over nearly the entire length of the film. Whether it be odd/surreal imagery, slow and deliberate camera-work, or an eerie score reminiscent of Ligeti's 'Atmospheres' (used in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), all of it is used to brilliant effect and should be capable of rattling even the most seasoned viewer, especially if they have a religious background/upbringing (as I did). In fact, I sensed a lot of Kubrick here; not just 2001, but also THE SHINING. Not surprisingly, they share some thematic elements. The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years.",10,131,231,14 May 2016
12 Years a Slave," Uncomfortable, but necessary viewing
","12 YEARS A SLAVE is one of the most uncomfortable viewing experiences I've had in recent memory. It wasn't because I felt guilty for something my ancestors may (or may not) have had responsibility for, but because occasionally I felt that the movie wallowed in its own misery. It also felt exploitative and emotionally manipulative at times. That said, if one does not come away from this absolutely detesting slavery as an institution, there is something truly wrong with you. Fortunately, this story has a happy(ish) ending. Otherwise, the oppressive atmosphere might have choked all the life out of the story. On a technical level, the movie is astounding. Steve McQueen is an auteur to watch, now having three critically praised films under his belt. I also loved the score by Hans Zimmer, which was stark when it needed to be, but also filled with tenderness and longing. There are also several Negro spirituals peppered throughout which were also uplifting. Overall, this is a must-see film, not just because it's won a lot of awards, but because it treats a touchy subject with the honesty it deserves. However, I wouldn't watch it more than once unless you're a glutton for punishment.",7,0,2,14 November 2014
Sausage Party," A graphic religious allegory (and not for kids)
","Nothing in the trailers will prepare you for this movie, including what it's actually about. SAUSAGE PARTY is an allegory about religion and how ridiculous it is, but also about how we can overcome our differences and learn to get along. Granted, there is no solution proposed nor does the humor rarely rise above obvious sexual puns and stereotypes (different foods represent ethnic groups, minorities, etc.), but the throw-everything-at-the-wall approach guarantees that at least some of it sticks. And importantly, for a comedy, there are plenty of genuine laughs to be had. Then there's the ending, which I will not spoil. Suffice it to say that it seemed oddly appropriate...and that you can get away with quite a bit more in an animated film than live-action. This wasn't the craziest or funniest thing I've ever seen, but it made for a few dollars and a couple hours well-spent.",7,45,80,24 March 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A powerful statement on the madness of war
","Why I waste my time watching all of the newest films that come out (of course, not all of them are bad) when there are plenty of tried-and-true classics waiting to be discovered is something I'll never completely understand. It's not even like I have the excuse that I don't know about them, or even don't have the time (because I do). Still, I do like the feeling of seeing something for the first time and THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI delivered everything I expected and more. The story is set during WWII and is about a group of British POWs who arrive at a Japanese labor camp in the Burmese jungle (modern-day Myanmar). They are tasked with building a bridge over the Kwai River, but initially have difficulty because the camp's commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has a clash of wills with their own commander, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness). There is also an American POW, Shears (William Holden) who manages to escape but is 'recruited' to lead a team back to the jungle to blow up the bridge.If there's one thing that David Lean knows how to do, it's craft an epic film and that's exactly what he did here. It did drag a little bit for me in the first hour, but it was an engrossing watch after that point. It almost goes without saying that this film is perfect from a technical standpoint, and some truly great images were captured. The acting was also just as good, especially from the three key players: Alec Guiness, Sessue Hayakawa, and William Holden. Each of them brought their A-game and turned in probably the best performances of their entire careers. One aspect of the story I really liked was the psychological battle of wills that occurs between Saito and Nicholson. Both of them were equal in rank, but also similar in their approach to their own specific situations. One might say that they were cut from the same cloth. William Holden rounds out this trio of characters by portraying a man who is drafted for a difficult task in spite of his desire to just keep on surviving, and in a cruel turn of irony, puts him at cross-purposes with Nicholson who feels like he is doing good work by building the bridge.Although the film plays it rather close to the vest in terms of message-making, only really making its statement in the final minutes, I thought that it handled the subject of war in a rather balanced and mature way despite taking a stand against it. Nobody is turned into a villain, instead having each major character be an unwitting foil to the other in a way that suggests what is later explicitly stated (by the medic) as madness. It's not perhaps the most original of anti-war statements, but it was portrayed to extremely good effect. Also, the last 20 minutes or so is as riveting and tense as anything that has come out since. Granted, it's not perfect as there is a rather superfluous romance between Shears and his nurse but, studio-mandated love interest aside, this film stands as not only one of the best anti-war films ever made, but one of the best films period.",9,0,1,5 February 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," A surprisingly clever sci-fi film
","This is yet another 2014 film that I'm late to although, considering the lackluster box office take, there's probably a lot of people who weren't aware of this or went and saw something else instead. It's their loss, though, as this is an incredible sci-fi adventure with plenty of action, humor and a dynamite lead performance by Tom Cruise. The gist of the story is that Major Bill Cage (Cruise) is a media specialist/recruiter for the Army who really likes his cushy job, but ends up getting thrown headlong into combat. On the morning of a huge invasion he ends up getting killed, but something happens to him that allows him to reset the day whenever he dies. The rest of the story is him trying to find a way to defeat the alien invaders, called Mimics, by taking advantage of this new ability. The person who really sells this movie is Tom Cruise, who is game for pretty much everything thrown at him. He gives an honest emotional as well as physical performance. Also of note are Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson who also do well in their roles. Emily Blunt does especially well, adding some emotional depth to the story while playing an uncharacteristically tough female role in a male-dominated story. Did I mention that she also kicks a lot of butt? Another element that elevated it above your typical alien invasion sci-fi film was the amount of humor. All of it came naturally out of the story and situations dictated by the plot, and none of it felt forced at all. The visual effects were also top-notch, and I liked the alien creature designs. The only couple of negatives I can draw out are some shaky-cam in the battle scenes, which is still kind of appropriate and recalls the Normandy beach landing in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and that a lot of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough outside of the stars in the cast. That being said, everyone gave an excellent performance. Overall, despite having the same gimmick as GROUNDHOG DAY, EDGE OF TOMORROW is an exciting, engaging and, in the end, thoughtful sci-fi film that has immense replay value. This is definitely one movie you won't mind watching again.",9,0,3,18 October 2014
Whiplash," A blistering, intensely gratifying study on what it takes to succeed
","My head is still spinning from the whirlwind of what I just experienced. WHIPLASH isn't just a film. It has to be seen to be believed. The plot, although it probably won't do it justice, is about a young drummer (Miles Teller) who is accepted into a conservatory jazz band led by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Miles Teller's character wants to be one of the greats, and Fletcher uses what some would consider questionable methods to push him in that direction. That's really all you need to know going in. I should say that this is the absolute best I've seen out of Miles Teller, having graduated from teen fare like THE SPECTACULAR NOW. And J.K. Simmons? Wow! He brought such an intensity to his role that I wasn't prepared for. He's probably the best antagonist I've seen since R. Lee Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET, and pretty much as creative. However, it's not just the performances that make this such a compelling watch. This film has some of the best editing I've ever seen, and it fit so well with the jazz score. The various production elements were tightly woven and integrated in a way that pulls you into the story and never lets you go until the final frame. Unlike, say BIRDMAN, this completely lived up to the hype in my opinion. As a character study on what it takes to succeed, WHIPLASH is second to none. This feels like something that will be studied in years to come, and it's definitely worth your time.",10,1,2,27 July 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Somewhat of a thematic retread, but Scorsese fires on all cylinders
","THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is insanely hyper-kinetic, wall-to-wall with sex and drug-taking, and the most energetic Scorsese has been since CASINO and GOODFELLAS. While this doesn't quite live up to those previous films, it is nevertheless quite entertaining. The story follows the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, who ran a brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont, in the late 80's/early 90's. Along the way, he makes a ton of money and indulges his every whim, which was mostly a lot of drugs. A smaller part of the story is how he was taken down by the FBI, but the main draw is obviously Jordan. In his previous gangster/crime films, Scorsese provided the viewer with a window into how those criminal enterprises operate, and he does the same here with white collar crime. One thing which was extremely effective, yet detracts from the experience a little bit, was how Scorsese used cinematic technique and a frenetic editing style to convey the themes of excess, over-indulgence and greed. It makes logical sense that a film about a person like Jordan Belfort would be this stuffed, even if it does start to wear on the viewer after a while (as it certainly did me). Fortunately, there were some quieter moments, and scenes where a voice of reason could be heard, even if it was ultimately ignored. However, there should be something said about the end result. Unlike previous characters who were reduced to shells of their former selves, Jordan Belfort gets off fairly lightly. Sure, he goes to prison, but it's a cushy prison and he only has to serve a few years. Perhaps this is cynicism on Scorsese's part, and maybe it's emblematic of where our society has gone. Instead of the ultimately good-natured criminal who looks out for the interests of a family-like organization, we have greedy vultures who only look out for themselves, and by and large we let them take advantage of us in ways that are truly despicable. The film makes a point about not showing the victims of Jordan's crimes, but I didn't find this too disheartening. The movie is meant to revolve around Jordan and to give the viewer an experience which approaches what his life was like. Sure, parts of it are extremely funny, but underneath all of the humor lies a rather masochistic current. Excess will ruin you, and by the end of this you should feel disgusted at how people are treated (especially the women) and exhausted from the whirlwind ride you've just been taken on. Even though the film does become repetitive after a while, I wouldn't have wanted to be taken on this journey with anyone but Scorsese. It's not quite a masterpiece, or even top-tier Scorsese, but it's a film worth watching even if only once.",8,1,2,14 November 2014
The Reader," Like a good book that you can't put down
","While not the best example of a Holocaust movie, THE READER transcends that by portraying a sensitive and emotionally moving story about a man's relationship with a woman he later finds out was an SS guard. Every aspect of this film was exquisitely put together, from the cinematography to the score, and all of the performances were excellent as well. In particular, Kate Winslet gives a nuanced performance as the former SS guard and Ralph Fiennes is wonderfully understated as Michael Berg (in middle-age), the titular reader. Without giving anything away, the depth of the title's meaning will become apparent about midway through the film. Thematically, it deals with secrecy in relationships and being able to read people. How does a person's past affect perception of them, especially if learned after the fact? Does it change what they mean to us? All of those questions are worth pondering and are dealt with in an interesting way through the lens of the Holocaust. The only issue I took with the film is that towards the end, Michael has a meeting with a survivor who somewhat punishes the audience for feeling any sympathy whatsoever for the woman at the center of the story. Is it right to sympathize with someone who is responsible for horrible things? I'll leave that up for other people to decide. Bottom line, this was a well-produced, finely acted drama that deserved the awards attention that it got.",7,0,0,7 October 2014
Ray," Come for the music, stay for Jamie Foxx's performance
","By this point it's pretty hard to do something original with a biopic, and now that I've seen several of them (particularly the musical kind) a pattern has emerged. Typically, they will pick a time period in a person's life/career and focus on a certain personal struggle and how they overcome it. With musicians, this often involves women and substance abuse. 'Tis the same story with Ray Charles. RAY focuses on Ray Charles' beginnings in the music business up through the point at which he came clean off of heroin (around 1966). To round out the narrative, there are flashbacks to his childhood and an extended coda which ties up a significant plot point from before and serves as an epitaph to his life and career (the film came out several months after his death). Because so many biopics follow the same formula, what distinguishes them from one another (other than the subject) is the quality of the performances and the ingenuity with which they are put together, and RAY certainly stands out from the rest thanks in large part to an excellent central performance by Jamie Foxx. The way he inhabits Ray Charles is uncanny at times, although the straightforward dramatic scenes verge on mimicry in a way that stands out more when juxtaposed with the performance scenes. For me, the performance scenes work better because Jamie Foxx was able to capture a realness and immediacy that comes from someone who is intimately familiar with performing music on the stage (as Foxx is also a singer). Beyond that I thought that the editing, particularly in the musical sequences had a certain kinetic energy that brought the performances to life. However, I found it a little distracting that Ray Charles' voice was coming out of Jamie Foxx's body when there was a few early scenes where Jamie Foxx used his own voice to sing. Even still, I got used to it after a while. In general, I thought that everyone gave a good performance, and the film had an excellent ensemble cast. One thing I also thought was done rather well was the hallucinogenic nature of the flashback scenes, which added a layer of artfulness as inner turmoil, with Ray Charles feeling guilty about how his younger brother died. What I felt didn't always work was the general formula and obligatory dramatic moments which hit again and again just how dependent Ray became on heroin. I got a little tired and frustrated with it in WALK THE LINE (although that came out the following year, and followed RAY's playbook) and felt the same way here. Yes, it was a compelling arc to have in a general sense, but it's something that's been played out a little bit too much, in my opinion. Despite the formulaic nature of the plot and story, I had a great time with RAY because of the talented actors who brought it to life, and the energetic and soulful musical numbers. RAY might rely a little too heavily on formula, but at least it's a winning one.",7,1,2,26 April 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Actors are people too, you know
","BIRDMAN is directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrittu and stars Michael Keaton as a former movie superhero who takes it upon himself to direct, write and star in a Broadway play. Joining him are Zack Galifianakis, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and Edward Norton who play his agent, fellow cast members, and daughter. My initial thoughts when starting it weren't too great, but I gradually came to appreciate it a little more for its technical achievement and some interesting observations on the lives of actors. Still, in a film about the ego of actors and the importance of artistic expression (among other things), it came off as egotistical and self-important. Without giving away specifics or plot spoilers, I can say that the film is very 'meta.' Michael Keaton is playing a character who has some similarities, or shares some DNA, with his real-life persona, as does Edward Norton (apparently). Michael Keaton's Riggan Thompson is a former blockbuster movie star who is trying to do something artistic for personal validation, and Edward Norton's Mike Shiner is a method actor who probably takes his job a little too seriously. For me, those two characters (and their interactions) form the central dialogue and message the film is trying to get across. They also had the most interesting dynamic in the story. What I didn't necessarily warm up to was the rather cynical attitude it had towards critics and big-budget filmmaking. And some of the magical realism came off as labored attempts to be clever. Elements that did work a little more include Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, giving the film a Malickian feel, and the drum score. Overall, I would say that I appreciated the film for what it is more than actually liking or enjoying it. It has an impeccable technical construction, but a lot of the dialogue and overt messaging felt more like therapy for actors and didn't engage me like a straightforward drama normally would. Even though this is Inarrittu's most playful film yet, it made me long for the emotional manipulation of something like 21 GRAMS. There is a time and place for different kinds of movies, and the way the film takes sides when they both feed into each other was rather disingenuous. I can understand why this film did so well at the Oscars, because Hollywood always likes patting themselves on the back, but it has mixed results as entertainment.",6,1,2,14 July 2015
Centurion," A potent combination of historical speculation and gonzo violence
","While there isn't too much depth to the plot or characters, CENTURION is a passable period action film about what might have happened to Rome's 9th Legion. The cast is led by Michael Fassbender as the titular centurion, Quintas Dias, and has Dominic West as a Roman general and Bond girl Olga Kurylenko as a mute Pict warrior. Overall, the performances are decent but nothing truly amazing. Some of the highlights of the film were creative opening titles, some beautiful, blue-tinged cinematography and a rousing score. However, the biggest draw are the action sequences and Neil Marshal really delivered in the blood-and-guts department. Limbs are hacked off, people are stabbed and shot with arrows, and blood flowed freely. The only downside to this aspect of the film was the way in which they were shot, i.e., similar to GLADIATOR and other movies like that. If one were to compare this movie to another one, I would pick KING ARTHUR because of the time period and subject matter. Even the plots are similar. But despite the similarities, I would think CENTURION edges out KING ARTHUR by a little bit because it isn't aspiring to be some epic origin story. This movie is fairly basic and knows it. There's even a half-baked romantic subplot, which isn't even introduced until the movie is half over. So, if you're looking for a decent action movie that won't tax your brain too much, this one should do just fine.",7,1,4,14 November 2014
The Conjuring," Plays like a greatest hits compilation by a cover band
","THE CONJURING is a technically proficient, yet ultimately empty and derivative scare-fest which fails to deliver any real scares. Before jumping into what I find wrong with it, I will give some credit to James Wan for effectively using camera-work and the soundtrack to ratchet up the tension, but he mostly goes for the overkill approach. The score is overbearing and telegraphs each and every jump scare from a mile away. There were only a couple of moments that even slightly startled me. Not only that, but the movie doesn't even try very hard to create an emotional connection between the audience and the family who's being haunted. The only characters that are explored and developed in any way are the Warrens, who don't even really enter the main story until about halfway through the movie. Until then, you have two separate story strands (which could have been two separate movies) which only intersect in a convoluted way. Therein lies another problem: they could have cut out a lot of side-story involving the Warren's daughter in favor of developing the family that's central to the 'conjuring.' It's almost like the movie wants to do too much. Then, there's the laughable source material. I am not one who subscribes to a belief in the supernatural so the entire pretext/concept for the movie is not one that particularly engages me. Still, they could have done a whole lot better to engage me in other ways, like actually getting me to care about the situation. Instead, they import every genre cliché and trope from nearly every other paranormal horror movie, throw it at the screen and hope it sticks. Not much of it does. Still, I will give the movie credit for effectively using a balance of practical and CGI effects. Some of the stuff they show isn't too graphic, but it's creepy enough to leave an impression, at least for a little while. So, is it worth watching? Only if you haven't seen stuff like POLTERGEIST, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, and even James Wan's own INSIDIOUS which at least introduces some comic relief to lighten things up. This movie takes itself WAY too seriously, and suffers as a result. It's also borrows so much from other, greater films that it feels like a greatest hits compilation at best. Too bad it falls flat on it's face.",5,0,1,14 November 2014
Halloween," The gold standard for slasher films
","If PSYCHO is the prototypical slasher film then HALLOWEEN is the blueprint and set the standard for all that followed. You have John Carpenter in top form, creating one of the best, if not the best, slasher film ever. Of note is the creepy piano/synth score by John Carpenter which, in addition to the impressive cinematography, helps maintain an atmosphere of tension and dread. He also makes excellent use of location to create a sense of claustrophobia, particularly in a closet scene where Laurie is trying to hide from The Shape. However, there are a few things that keep this from being a perfect film. First, the acting from most of the principle cast is marginal at best, with Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis being notable exceptions. Still, Donald Pleasence isn't given too much to do as Loomis because his character is woefully underwritten. He is meant to be the link between the Michael of the past and the Shape of the present, but he mostly shows up to provide exposition and nab the bad guy in the end. Still, I'd say this is one of the best horror movies ever made and definitely the best in the Halloween series. It's a movie that defined a genre and continues to bear the standard for it.",9,1,3,14 November 2014
The Iron Giant," A poignant and message-driven film that will appeal to all ages
","One of the many struggles that filmmakers run into when making a children's film is creating something that appeals to both the children and their parents, who will most likely be watching it with them. THE IRON GIANT is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. While children (particularly boys) will appreciate the friendship of a boy with a giant robot, Brad Bird also manages to send up the Cold War era and provides a strong anti-gun message. For someone's debut film, I thought it was particularly impressive considering this is the same guy who would later make THE INCREDIBLES and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL. He shows a firm directorial hand and gets excellent voice performances from the talent involved. It also helps that the story is very streamlined, so there aren't any pacing issues. The story also takes a rather poignant turn in the end that is completely earned. If I had to pick a single favorite moment from the film, it would probably be the end. Overall, THE IRON GIANT is a touching children's film with a heavy dose of nostalgia for a simpler time. This is a great film that can be enjoyed by parents and children alike.",9,0,1,31 March 2015
Taken 2," Coasts on Liam Neeson's charisma despite being more contrived than the first
","TAKEN 2 is a blatant rehash of its predecessor that also has a marked reduction in filmmaking quality, yet it is still watchable due to Liam Neeson's work in the lead role. Bryan Mills is back in this sequel to surprise hit TAKEN, and this time he's been able to get a little more involved with his family while also doing security work on the side. While on assignment in Istanbul, his wife and daughter show up unexpectedly, but unbeknownst to them, survivors of the Albanian family that Bryan massacred in the previous film have tracked him down in order to exact their revenge. What this film makes evident is just how contrived the plot of the first one was, and ups the ante in terms of the lack of believability. While the film starts off in similar fashion to the previous one, there is a plot element which becomes convenient later for the sake of having an action set-piece. This set-piece is a car chase through the streets of Istanbul that has Maggie Grace's character drive like a maniac all while being chased by the Albanian baddies. Other ridiculous elements include a laughable scene where Bryan has his daughter throw grenades into public places so that he can approximate her location relative to his by how long the sound takes to reach him. It's absolutely ludicrous, but still funny at the same time. However, the real negative that can be taken away is the change in shooting/editing style, courtesy of director Olivier Megaton. While Pierre Morel attempted to give TAKEN a modicum of comprehensibility, Olivier Megaton opts for shaky-cam and haphazard editing (frame-cutting, rapidly changing angles) that obscures what seemed like some decent fight choreography. Even the visual aesthetic has been changed to reflect this more down-and-dirty style which, while effective at conveying a sense of urban dirtiness and griminess, gave the film an ugly sheen which put a damper on what could have been a relatively fun adventure. Still, despite all of this and the fact that all of the supporting characters come off as perfunctory, Liam Neeson is able to sell this concept yet again. Overall, its quality doesn't live up to its predecessor's fine production values, but fans of the original should find enjoyment.",5,1,1,10 October 2014
Straight Outta Compton," A flawed, but loving, tribute to Eazy-E
","I've had an on/off relationship with hip-hop and rap music, and I'm certainly not well-versed in the history or behind-the-scenes goings-on with the artists themselves. However, I love a good musical biopic and STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is certainly that. For those few unaware, 'Straight Outta Compton' was the debut album (and title track) from rap group NWA, with members Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Easy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella (there might be more, but the film focused on those five). It tells the story of how the group came together, created some of their hit records, and broke up due to various reasons, mainly involving money and contracts. If that sounds like a lot to fit into a two and a half hour movie, you'd probably be right. It doesn't just stop with NWA's breakup, then following the solo careers of the three most important members. If there's a strike against the movie, it's that there was too much ground to cover and not enough time to do it satisfactorily. Still, the performances were excellent and I thought the actors did an incredible job of inhabiting their real-life counterparts. It should also go without saying that the film has stellar soundtrack. Narratively, the film seems to focus the most on Eazy-E, who the film is dedicated to, and most of the best moments involve him. There were many great moments, in fact, ranging from elation and awe, to a few that will probably have you tearing up. As for the film's Oscar snub, I can see why many felt it deserved a nod, but it honestly was a little too overreaching and bloated. Entertaining and fulfilling? Yes, but not necessarily Oscar-worthy. However, Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E) was most definitely snubbed. Overall, I feel like NWA's story would have been better served as a miniseries, considering how complex and large in scope the narrative is, but there is a 20-minute longer Director's Cut that I will be checking out in the near future. As for what I just watched, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is a fascinating look at the rise of some music legends, an intimate look behind the curtain of the music business, and a loving tribute to a friend.UPDATE (Director's Cut): I honestly couldn't tell where they added a lot of material. There didn't seem to be any new scenes, but what I did notice was extra material added to the beginning or ending of scenes, extending them by a small amount. As I had hoped, most of it fleshed out the story a little more instead of just adding extra material for the sake of it. Overall, I enjoyed the film more the second go-round, although the weaknesses in the second half still remain. Another thing I noticed, or considered, is the possibility that some scenes were probably constructed specifically for the film (all in the second half). Although maybe not 100% accurate to real life, I thought that some conversational scenes dealing with the prospect of bringing NWA back together (before Eazy-E's illness and death), regardless of whether or not they actually happened, worked dramatically and allowed some partial closure to what was one of music's most infamous breakups. Thinking back on the two times I've watched STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON now, I have to consider this a new standard for musical biopics. More than just relaying a series of events, it touches on issues that unfortunately still remain relevant, namely the struggle between artists and management and, more importantly, the often contentious relationship between cops and the people they're supposed to serve. In this way, I think the film really captured the zeitgeist of this day and age, and will endure as a staple of its genre.",8,3,27,8 May 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," An entertaining and unwieldy mess
","What could I possibly say that thousands of people haven't already said? Probably not much, but I'll try. BATMAN V SUPERMAN was one of my most anticipated films this year, although the polarized reaction toward it certainly made me lower my expectations a little bit. One thing I noticed on first viewing was that the pacing was a little off, particularly in the first and last half hours. Early scenes seemed heavily edited, and it took way too long for the different narrative threads to come together. The central conflict, while built up satisfactorily, was almost anticlimactic and resolved way too quickly. To avoid spoilers, I won't divulge what happens afterwards, but it did feel very tacked on, almost an afterthought. Lastly, the action was over-CGI'ed and mind-numbing at times. It looked cool, but lacked heft and believability. Still, one has to admire the scope and ambition of Zack Snyder & Co. It touches upon some interesting philosophical themes, however lightly. It also has some great character moments/development, that build upon what MAN OF STEEL started. Ultimately, I look forward to seeing the story fleshed out more in the Extended Cut where, hopefully, the editing and pacing will be a little better. The only element I hated outright was Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve movies was stupid, yes, but Eisenberg's rendition pushes it into extremely annoying territory. As for the score, it was appropriately epic and emotional when it needed to be. My favorite themes were, ironically, Lex's theme, and Wonder Woman's theme. All things considered, I liked the film despite its flaws, but it was undeniably messy and unwieldy.ULTIMATE EDITION: This is the version I was waiting for. While it doesn't eliminate the flaws inherent in the theatrical cut, it features improved editing/pacing and provides much-needed connective tissue that fleshes out the story and makes it more comprehensible. The majority of the additional 30 minutes were placed before the title fight and expand upon the various investigations by Lois, Clark, and Bruce that lead up to the central brawl. Character motivations were made clearer (particularly Lex) and, more importantly, the narrative was able to breathe a little. I still think that Lex's plan was kind of stupid and ridiculously complex but, thanks to the extended running time, his role was diluted somewhat and made his presence a little more tolerable. There were also some additional shout-outs/fan service/references to the DC Universe, like Steppenwolf and Arkham Asylum. Overall, I still found myself cheering and tearing up at the same places, but this Ultimate Edition is definitely a step up from its theatrical counterpart and is a fuller, more satisfying story.",7,0,0,30 July 2016
Thor: The Dark World," A lesser entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","While it still mostly on par with the first THOR, this sequel feels bigger while also losing a lot of the human connection which made the previous one enjoyable. There are some fleeting moments of humor, but there's also a lot of gloom and doom. In THOR: THE DARK WORLD, Thor has to save the universe (Avengers anyone?) from Malekith and the Aether. Sure, there's some half-baked scientific explanation for all of it but the end result is a little disappointing. Malekith was a cool-looking villain, but not very engaging or charismatic. There were also a few too many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to impersonate other people. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kind of what I've come to expect from Marvel. The acting is very good, as is the action and visual effects. I still don't buy Natalie Portman as a scientist, but oh well. This isn't Marvel's best, but Phase 2 is going pretty good so far. If you've liked Marvel's previous entries, you should like this one too.",7,1,1,14 November 2014
Lucy," Entertaining hogwash
","For a film predicated on an oft-repeated (and debunked) popular myth, LUCY is pretty entertaining, if a little ridiculous. Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy, a young woman is pulled into being a drug mule. However, interesting things start happening to her when the drug leaks into her system. Among the complaints one could lodge against LUCY, the biggest one is how thinly written the whole thing is. We are given precious little information about Lucy, and most of the other characters don't do much but further the plot along or provide exposition. Morgan Freeman is probably the most interesting of these, a scientist/professor whose field of research happens to coincide with what Lucy is experiencing. Still, the film seems to be aware of this and wastes no time in getting to the point. It follows a very fast pace, and it becomes almost a game to guess what powers Lucy will access as her cerebral capacity gets closer to 100%. There's also some real-life footage of animals and cool visual effects sequences of cells dividing and cosmic-level events which one will either take as profound or pretentious. I took it as somewhere in between, but leaning more towards the latter. I didn't really get the feeling that the film was going for a particular message, but the idea that wonder is part of what makes us human is an interesting one, as Lucy becomes less human the more knowledge and brain power she acquires. There also seemed to be the idea that knowledge makes us god-like. Altogether, it waxed fairly philosophical for an action film with a threadbare plot. Time will only tell whether or not I really love it, but for now I'm content in saying I liked LUCY a lot. Luc Besson's films have never been known for being particularly deep, but he seemed to be having a lot of fun here creating something that does make you think a little, even if it's based on an incorrect idea. For all it lacks in plot or story, LUCY has plenty of gumption when it comes to philosophical and visual ideas.",7,1,5,26 July 2015
The Producers," I laughed a lot, which is success for a comedy
","As I make my way through Mel Brooks' filmography, I am constantly reminded of how funny he is. I mean, who else would think of making a movie about two Broadway producers who make a musical about Hitler? I laughed so much it hurt. Of course, my head often hurt for other reasons too. Gene Wilder, while quite hilarious himself, frequently got on my nerves with his manic episodes. It was funny the first couple of times, but it annoyed me afterwards. The true star of the film was Dick Shawn, who played the lead actor in the musical 'Springtime for Hitler.' He was such a pleasure to watch. Overall, I would say this is one of the more straightforwardly comedic Mel Brooks films. I certainly laughed more consistently than with his other ones. However, I don't see myself rewatching this a lot. It was good for a 'one and done.' I'm glad I saw it, and now I'll move onto his other work.",7,1,2,2 September 2016
Rear Window," Interesting social commentary wrapped up in Hitchcock's best film so far
","Not having seen every film that Hitchcock made, and therefore not entirely qualified to analyze what makes a film 'his,' REAR WINDOW is definitely getting closer to what my idea of the ideal Hitchcock film is. Like his other pictures, it takes a simple premise and puts the audience through the wringer as to how it will turn out. Here, James Stewart plays L.B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photojournalist who passes the time by looking at his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. However, based on some things he sees, he begins to think that a murder may have been committed. Having just come off of ROPE, where the film was edited to appear as one single take, I noticed another technical challenge with this. The entire view the audience is given is from Jeff's apartment, which essentially forces us into his perspective. We see exactly what he sees, and know what he knows (with a few exceptions). In the hands of a weaker director, having basically only one fully developed character would have resulted in a very weak film, but Hitchcock makes it work somehow. It also doesn't hurt that James Stewart has a likable screen presence. And boy, is Grace Kelly easy on the eyes (and a talented actress, too)! However, what made the film so much more interesting was the social commentary that Hitchcock flirted with for part of the running time. Most of it is contained in some first-half conversations between Jeff and his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly). Although I could just be reading this onto the film, it seems like Jeff's apartment-bound snoop is a metaphor for society's growing passivity. This is kind of supported by the fact that he's averse to getting married, is content with the status quo, etc. This is in contrast to his girlfriend, who is more ambitious. It's almost tragically ironic that they end up bonding over a murder they think has been committed based on their limited point of view from Jeff's apartment. Also, given the interconnectedness that the internet provides, and the privacy concerns that come along with it, one could certainly read the ethics of surveillance onto the film as well. Even if that wasn't the intention (and Hitchcock's primary concern was entertainment), you can certainly see how the film was prescient in that regard. Just substitute the digital world for the apartment complex, where you think that you know people based on what they post on Facebook. If anything, you can take away that life is better experienced than merely observed. However, my only minor complaint has to do with the ending (again). Hitchcock is a master when it comes to building tension and suspense, but after so much cinematic foreplay there wasn't enough time to savor the release when it comes. I will say that Raymond Burr, even though you only got really one scene to appreciate his character up close, was quite menacing. There were also lots of cool little moments that you get to see as Jeff spies on his neighbors. And, I was able to catch Hitchcock's cameo this time! From my limited perspective of only having seen a handful of Hitchcock's films at this point, I can still safely say that this is the best so far. I also can't wait to dig further into to his filmography.",9,1,3,6 August 2015
Pitch Perfect," Great music, so-so story
","First off, I'll admit to not being a fan of GLEE and I don't really get the fascination with acappella. It's just singing without instruments, and the most fun I can see people having with it is as a novelty. Still, I decided to check out PITCH PERFECT and see what all the fuss was about. My general impression was that the musical numbers were pretty good across the board, and quite creative. Everything else just kind of drags it down a bit. The basic plot is that an all-girl college acappella group is trying to redeem themselves after an embarrassing loss at the last year's finals. It also served as an opportunity for a diverse group of girls, who normally wouldn't be together, to get to know each other and become friends. The cast isn't really filled with a lot of recognizable faces, but they all give decent performances. Still, the lack of character depth is apparent and none of them really approach anything past caricatures. Everyone has a couple of characteristics or quirks that get mined for laughs throughout the whole movie, and it did get old after a while. Plot-wise, no new ground was broken either. Everything happens exactly how you expect it to, complete with a last-minute crisis that gets resolved a little too quickly and cleanly. And really, outside of that there really isn't any conflict or reason to care about any of the characters. Still, the musical numbers are quite impressive, and the only reason I'm rating this as high as I am. While the core group, the Barden Bellas, stick to the same songs for the most of the movie, only changing up their act in the final part of the movie, everyone else varies their material and gives it a nice touch. There are a wide variety of songs chosen, and they're performed in visually interesting ways and have good choreography as well. The contemporary soundtrack was also quite good too. Overall, I thought the movie was OK, but nothing to rave about. Despite the great soundtrack and musical performances, the plot is rote and the characters all one-note. It isn't horrible by any stretch, but the only reason to see it is for the music or if you're a GLEE fan.",6,0,0,14 November 2014
The Truman Show," A heartfelt dramatic satire that remains one of Jim Carrey's best
","This was an incredible, heartbreaking, yet uplifting story of a man who discovers that his entire existence is manufactured. Jim Carrey gives a powerful performance as the titular character, whose wide-eyed optimism and sense of humor make it nearly impossible not to root for him. We, as the viewers, are treated to three different perspectives: Truman's World, Christof's World and the rest of the world who have been watching Truman's life unfold since the day he was born. Beyond the creepy, suburbanesque world that Christof created for him is the real world where billions of people watch him day in and day out. One thing that movie does extremely well (although I don't think it was the first) is how eerily prescient it is in predicting the nature of reality TV and its effect on our culture. It also explores themes such as the nature of reality. It's just an incredible film all around, and should be seen by everyone.",10,0,0,14 November 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A significant improvement over its predecessor
","CATCHING FIRE is a marked improvement over THE HUNGER GAMES, in everything from the script and story, to the visuals and cinematography. The story continues to follow Katniss (and Peeta) as they do a victory tour of Panem. However, things are not as happy as you think might be. Revolution is brewing, and the people in charge want to nip it in the bud. This is solved by having a special Hunger Games for the 75th year. Instead of fresh tributes, they will be reaped from the existing pool of victors. What follows is a fascinating and engaging look at a dystopian society, the battle for survival, etc. This definitely held my interest better than the limpid previous installment. One thing that's immediately noticeable is the change in visual style, and the way they shot the movie. Instead of a lot of hand-held and shaky camera, the shots are better composed, wider and more fluid. This is especially helpful in maintaining a sense of place in the arena. I also liked how they gave more time for character development, even for President Snow. They even manage to give most of the new characters their due on screen as well. Standouts were Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin as Finnick O'Dair(?). The only I really don't care for in these movies is the love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta. Twilight already did it, and every movie since has had some variation on it. Overall, this movie is much better than the first one though, and the final two installments will be directed by the same person (Francis Lawrence). They do a better job with the technical aspects, handling of the story and thematic elements and a much better job of building the world of Panem. Even if you didn't like the first one, you should give this a try.",8,0,12,14 November 2014
Godzilla," 'Let them fight!'
","Not having been able to go out to the theater too much last year, this was one of many films that I missed then but am catching up on now. While it wouldn't have made my top 10 for the year, this was definitely one of the best monster/disaster movies I've seen in recent memory. The story follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson), a Navy bomb disposal expert, who travels to Japan to get his father out of some trouble. His father used to work for a Japanese company, but after a cataclysmic event 15 years ago the area has been quarantined off, yet he still thinks that there's something going on besides the official story that it was a natural disaster. The 'thing' actually turns out to be a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) that they've been keeping contained. However when it escapes all hell breaks loose, and chaos and massive destruction ensue. Of course, you might be wondering where Godzilla fits into all of this. Despite the title of the movie, Godzilla only appears on screen for about 10-15 minutes. Still, the those precious minutes are worth it as he takes on the MUTO. One thing I appreciated about the film was that it didn't overexpose the monsters, instead letting the human drama take center stage. You get to spend time with the characters you'd most identify with, and the effects of a disaster were dealt with in a very realistic, down-to-earth way, even amongst all of the chaos and destruction. In fact, there was quite a large human cast such that I'd almost wish they'd delved a little deeper so that more time could be spent building things up. The worst offender is probably the prologue which set everything up. It was very effective in establishing a baseline, but not so much in terms of character building. Of course, all complaints aside, all of the performances were excellent. I just wish there had been more Bryan Cranston. In terms of visual effects and spectacle, this film stands head and shoulders above everything that came out in 2014. Scenes of destruction and mayhem were handled very well, and the creatures were also very well-animated. I should also mention the outstanding score by Alexandre Desplat, which hit all the right beats and fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Overall, I'm kind of disappointed that I didn't see this on the big screen but it was still an exciting viewing experience. It pays attention to its human characters and while the monsters don't take up too much screen time, when the action comes it delivers big time. Highly recommended.",7,3,5,16 January 2015
Footloose," A decent time-passer that should appeal to its target demographic
","I haven't seen the '84 original starring Kevin Bacon, so I didn't go into this with those kind of expectations. The plot is a fairly simple teens vs. adults story, so I also wasn't expecting anything terribly deep. And, now having finished it I would say that my limited expectations of at least being entertained were met. Beyond that, FOOTLOOSE is a very clichéd teen drama that just happens to have good music and dancing sequences. The gist of the story is that a city kid, Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald) moves in with relatives who live in the sleepy southern town of Bomont, Georgia. Three years ago, after a tragic accident took the lives of five teenagers, the town council enacted a series of ordinances that aimed to prevent what caused it. Among those was an ordinance banning public dancing for those under 18 years of age.To me, such a set up is flimsy at best but the film worked with it in a decent, if pedestrian, way. On the surface is functions as story in which the rebellious teens face off against the stubborn, over-protective adults. But, towards the end, they manage to shoehorn a message about parents learning to trust their children. Nice, but a little too late if you ask me. The most interesting aspect of the film to me was the way in which it pits small-town life and values against real-world logic. I don't feel like the film ever disrespected people who live like that, but it wasn't exactly friendly towards them either. More problematic to me was a minister (Dennis Quaid) who wants to protect his daughter (Julianne Hough) against an abusive guy, yet slaps her across the face when she starts mouthing him off. That one scene came as an unwelcome surprise to me, and something which seemed completely out of character.In terms of acting, nobody was particularly bad. Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell came off looking the best, but I wouldn't place what they did here among their best work. As for Julianne Hough, let's just say she shouldn't abandon her singing and dancing careers. Kenny Wormald did fine as Ren McCormack but, like every other actor playing a teenager in this film, was utterly unconvincing as such. In terms of filmmaking quality, the cinematography and choreography was fine but unspectacular. Overall, it was a decent time-passer that was fitfully entertaining. It was a little too predictable for my tastes, and also not targeted to me, but that shouldn't stop teenagers enjoying it for the frivolous piece of entertainment that it is.",5,0,3,31 January 2015
50_50," Has enough humor and heart to elevate it beyond similarly-themed films
","While it could have gone the route of being maudlin and going for a cheap emotional gut punch, 50/50 is a fairly well-written, honest portrayal of someone who finds out they have cancer. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a guy who 'doesn't smoke...and recycles' but finds out that he has a rare form of spinal cancer. Together with his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and a novice therapist (Anna Kendrick), he eventually comes to terms with his condition despite the many setbacks he experiences. Chief among these is a cheating girlfriend (Dallas Bryce Howard). I mean, what girl would cheat on her boyfriend after he finds out he has cancer? That was pretty low, and made her character extremely unlikeable. Of course, most of the central cast is unlikeable in some way. Adam becomes kind of a prick once he finds out about his condition, although this is somewhat understandable. Less understandable, although it's intrinsic to the type of characters Seth Rogen usually plays, is Kyle who uses Adam's condition as a way to hook up with women. Even though I can understand that someone who finds out they have a potentially terminal illness might use it to score, actually seeing it play out in a movie was kind of crass to me. Thankfully, the film doesn't stay there. Generally speaking, the plot was rather predictable in terms of the romantic aspect. You just kind of know that after Adam breaks up with his girlfriend he'll eventually end up with his cute therapist because that's just the way things work. I can almost forgive it since Anna Kendrick played such a dorky, likable person, but clichés are still clichés. I also didn't buy her for a second as someone working on their doctorate. Still, the performances were generally good and I couldn't really find fault with anyone. What really saved the film for me from being just a run-of-the-mill 'cancer comedy' (kind of odd to see those two words juxtaposed) were a couple of key scenes late in the movie which provided the emotional weight needed to anchor the film and provided a counter-balance to the crude humor that one would expect from a comedy starring Seth Rogen. But even though Seth Rogen is in the film, this is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's movie all the way and he does a great job of carrying it. Overall, I liked it a little more than I thought I might at first. The plot is rather predictable and cliché at times, but there was a lot of humor and heart that lifted it beyond other similar films.",7,0,0,26 March 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Hugely entertaining and loads of fun
","KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is one of those movies that grabs you by the stones and doesn't let go until the credits roll. I haven't seen any of the spy films that it pays homage to, but if they're anything like this I'll get right on it. The basic story is about a young man, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who joins a super-secret spy organization, helps save the world, and becomes a better person in the process. The entire cast did an incredible job playing their characters. You have seasoned veterans like Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. And then there is newcomer Taron Egerton, who is a revelation. He has a suave, cool attitude to him that really sold the character he played. Not only were the performances excellent all-round, the actors looked like they were having a great time, which spills over onto the audience as a result. The action sequences, an important part of a film like this, were also really good. Matthew Vaughn has a way with kinetic action (see: LAYER CAKE, KICK-ASS) and he delivers that here. Although the editing and camera-work pushes the boundaries of comprehensibility, the geography of each scene was never in question. The crown jewel of these is a scene in a church set to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird. If you aren't on-board with the film at this point, maybe it isn't for you. If there's anything that be said negatively about the film, the characterization of the villain might not sit well with some people. There also was quite a lot of CGI enhancement. And, there's one sexual joke/scene towards the end that could come off as crass, but I thought it was consistent with the type of film this was trying to be. Generally speaking, all of the complaints that could be made of the film have (to me, at least) a valid explanation. It's a highly entertaining film with a good story, excellent action, and a great sense of humor. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!",9,3,9,4 July 2015
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," A marginal improvement over 'New Moon'
","This installment of the Twilight saga is a slight improvement across the board from the last one, but it is still every bit as cheesy. The story this time is a little more engaging, following the love triangle between Edward, Bella and Jacob and revolving around an unexplained series of killings in Forks. It turns out to be an army of Newborns being built by Victoria, and this draws the attention of the Volturi, who have a slightly expanded presence here. One thing that does keep me watching these movies without being utterly bored is the unintentional humor, especially in this one. The scenes between Bella, Edward and Jacob are really funny and over-the-top in their portrayal of masculinity and because of the woodenness of the performances. Some other positives include effective tension in a few scenes, as well as more action. The obvious set-piece here would be the climactic battle between the Newborns and the Cullens and the werewolves. However, since the movie is PG-13, the violence is bloodless. I still have some problems with the visual effects being slightly less than convincing, but at this point I don't really expect them to improve significantly anyway. Generally speaking, the acting has improved marginally since the first one, but the material they're working with is passé, immature and flawed. One performance in particular that stuck out to me as being really bad was Dakota Fanning as Jane, one of the Volturi. Also, Stephenie Meyer's Mormon roots are on full display now, as Edward acts as the mouthpiece for 'traditional' values. It's a shame, really, that teenagers eat this stuff up. Times have changed, but most likely they were distracted by all of the teenage flesh on display. There's also a creepy moment early on where it's suggested (through dialogue) that Bella is essentially being groomed to be a vampire. This takes on a new meaning when you remember that Edward is over 100 years old, and Bella is a minor (although she does turn 18 in the movie). Still, this movie is somewhat worth watching, if only for the moments of unintentional comedy. Just don't complain if you don't like it, since you most likely made it through the previous installments to get to this one.",5,1,3,13 November 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," A melancholy but subtly humorous character study
","I've been a longtime admirer of the Coen Brothers, and they have made some of my favorite films. Still, most of them have been accessible in some way. This one was quite a hard nut to crack. INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a loose story about a down-on-his-luck singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac). To name a few problems, his former musical partner committed suicide, one of his sexual flings is pregnant and it may or may not be his, and he was recently let go from his record company. In other words, life is hard for him. To make matters worse, he isn't too sympathetic of a character either. His go-it-alone nature and tendency to speak his mind get him into hot water with a whole host of people he meets over the course of the film. And yet he keeps on going, devoted to pursuing his chosen profession. That was my way in, and what eventually helped me get into the movie. Despite what life threw at him, he never gave up. Not only that, but there were some truly soul-stirring songs peppered throughout which helped to lighten the mood, even if they did describe things like saying farewell and being hanged. I also enjoyed the color palette and general visual aesthetic of the film. It was almost like chiaroscuro with muted blues, grays and browns. Also, like most Coen Brothers films, this was a comedy, although there was more of a greater tragic/melancholy tone this time around. The closest comparison I can make is with their previous effort A SERIOUS MAN, which dealt with similar themes of a man against the world and falling victim to circumstance. However, LLEWYN DAVIS is played straighter and has a more uplifting resolution, if one can call it that. Overall, though my patience was tested at times, it was rewarded somewhat in the end. As far as technical filmmaking quality and the performers/performances involved, this some of the Coens' best work, even if it was a little dense for me at first. This probably isn't the best film for Coen Brothers initiates, but for seasoned viewers I feel like this could hold something special. In fact, I'll probably get more out of a second or third watch myself. Recommended, with some reservations.",7,0,2,14 November 2014
Saboteur," A solid wartime thriller
","Hitchcock is one of those directors that every film buff is aware of, but few will admit to having seen none of his films. Prior to this, I'd only seen THE BIRDS and PSYCHO (in that order), but that was a long time ago so I consider this to be my (re)introduction to him. Other than a lot of suspense, I wasn't really sure what to expect from SABOTEUR. It turned out to be quite good for an early Hitchcock film, although it betrays the time in which it was made a little too much. The story is about Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), who works at an airplane factory. One day a catastrophic fire kills one of his friends and he's pinned as the one responsible. This sets him on a journey to prove his innocence and find out just what is going on. Generally speaking, there wasn't a dull moment in this, although I do think it began to lose some narrative steam in the final half-hour as they struggle to find a way to keep the action going after the villain's endgame is (sort of) revealed. I do think it was well-acted and had interesting characters, although nearly everyone upstages Barry's 'Average Joe.' My two favorite characters are Philip Martin, the blind man he meets, and Tobin, someone who turns out to be very important. These two characters also happen to have a couple scenes which very eruditely give the thematic concerns we're supposed to take away from the film. Given that this produced during American involvement in WWII, anybody who didn't support the war effort would naturally have been looked on with suspicion. This is why the villains are saboteurs who aim to damage the US war effort. However, the blind man (in what might have been a compromise with the studio?) is made to say that even in times of war, our democratic principles still hold and a person is innocent until proved guilty. Without that counterpoint, I feel that the film would have verged on being jingoistic and meaninglessly patriotic. While I'm not too much enamored of the way the film reduces wartime politics to an 'us vs them' binary, Hitchcock did make a solidly thrilling picture that is still quite relevant today.",7,0,2,2 August 2015
Spectre," Perfectly serviceable despite moving back a step or two
","To be perfectly honest, I'm not the biggest Bond fan and, as such, haven't seen anyone but Daniel Craig in the role yet (I do own the box set, but haven't delved into it yet). QUANTUM OF SOLACE was a dud, while CASINO ROYALE and SKYFALL were really good, in my opinion. SPECTRE doesn't quite live up to the standard of those last two, but is a perfectly serviceable film that continues the trek closer to what I understand to be the classic Bond formula. Although the tone was about as serious as the Craig's previous three, I did notice significantly more humor, even if it was of the dry type. There was also more use of gadgets and the like. In general, all of the elements that make a Bond film a Bond film were there and I didn't mind at all. What didn't exactly work was the alternately slack and workmanlike pacing and some truly ridiculous and unnecessary third act plot twists that I will not spoil for those who may have not seen the film yet. Let's just say that some rumors about Christoph Waltz's character proved to be true, as was the case with Benedict Cumberbatch in STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS. So, what did I like? Well, the opening action sequence was pretty outstanding, despite not quite living up to the one in SKYFALL. In general, the action was well-executed and an intimate fight scene between Bond and Hinx ranks as one of the best action set-pieces in Craig's tenure as the character. I also liked the idea of connecting the events of the previous films in a manner that is unprecedented in the series. Still, the threads could have been connected in a better fashion by laying the seeds earlier rather than retconning them in a slapdash manner. I also liked the Bond girls, although Monica Bellucci barely had any screen time. Lea Seydoux's Madelyn Swann was no Vesper Lynd(?), but she was able to hold her own. What I didn't like as much was the rehashed plot elements, e.g., Bond being put off-duty for disobeying orders, being left on his own, etc., the lack of character development compared to previous (Daniel Craig) entries, and the intangible but noticeable feeling that the people making this were going through the motions. SPECTRE is beautifully helmed, but surprisingly emotionless at times, opting for spectacle and style over substance more often than not. When it comes down to it, SPECTRE is sufficiently entertaining but suffers in comparison to CASINO ROYALE and SKYFALL. Long-time fans will probably get a kick out of it regardless, but it may prove slightly disappointing for those accustomed to this current cycle of Bond films.",7,0,9,28 February 2016
Happy Feet," Story is a bit of a jumble, but it's still quite charming
","Even though the story is a little jumbled and the message is a little too obvious, the animation quality and incredible voice cast make this a treat for kids and their parents. The story is about Mumble, born into a colony of penguins that woo each other through song, but unable to sing himself. Instead, he knows how to tap dance, which makes him somewhat of an outcast. At the same time, the fish supply is dwindling. After being banished, he goes on an adventure to figure out why the fish are disappearing. If that description makes it seem like the plot is a little confused at times, that's because it is. The movie felt like a mash-up of two movies instead of one. The first half is about Mumble's attempts to fit in, while the second half goes into an almost preachy mode about humanity's impact on the environment. Still, the penguins are so charming that the kids probably won't mind and their are a wealth of singing and dancing sequences that are sure to put a smile on your face. Overall, while the story isn't the tightest and the environmental message might be a little heavy-handed, everything else about the movie screams quality entertainment, for kids and parents alike.",7,0,0,13 November 2014
Her," A low-key but engaging sci-fi
","HER is a very creative and unique film that focuses on technology and interpersonal relationships in the modern age. The story is about Theodore Twombly, who works for a company that writes letters for people who have trouble expressing their feelings. Recently separated from his wife, he acquires a new operating system and develops a romantic relationship with it. I know that part sounds weird, but the universe of the film is an indeterminate future where technology has reached the point that true AI is possible. It is established very early on that Theodore has trouble maintaining relationships with people, and there's one scene in particular that hits this point home. He's on a date with an attractive woman, but as the night moves on to the possibility of sex, the woman wants a level of commitment that he just isn't ready to get into again. The way Joaquin Phoenix played him felt very layered and full of subtlety, and I was able to identify heavily with his character, in part because I share a lot of similar traits. Still, the revelation was Scarlett Johansson who gives a voice-only performance as Samantha, Theodore's personal OS. As the movie goes on, Samantha evolves, becomes more nuanced in her understanding of human interaction and inadvertently helps Theodore along as well. This makes what happens at the end seem more fitting than tragic, despite the melancholy overtones. What the film seems to be saying about technology is that it is a means to an end, rather than the culmination of something. Human relationships are a vital part of life, and can't be supplanted by anything else. From a technical standpoint, the film is remarkable in its creation of a sterile and believable future. The sci-fi elements aren't too heavy-handed, and the romantic aspects of the plot are handled with care. I also think they captured some beautiful images which were paired nicely with Arcade Fire's score/soundtrack. There's also a great supporting performance by Amy Adams. Overall, despite being a little lackadaisical in its pacing, I think this is a film worth watching, and that has important things to say about love and technology.",7,0,1,14 November 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," George Miller's triumphant return puts other 'Mediocre!' action films to shame
","At this point, there's probably nothing original I could write about MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Following a long gestation period and an insane level of hype that it most certainly lived up to, this long-awaited sequel/reboot was just the kind of fuel injection that the action blockbuster has been in need of for quite some time. It's a balls-to-the-wall action film that is brimming with subtext in a way that most dramas don't even come close to matching. What George Miller has done is bring cinema back to the basics of the story told through moving images, with dialogue/exposition brought to a minimum. In the absence of a lot of talking, which some will interpret as a lack of story/plot while others will simply be turned off, the characters are developed through their actions, what they wear, what they drive, etc. It's basically a production designer's heaven, as there are no superfluous details. Everything and everyone in this world has a purpose, but you have to be perceptive enough to catch it; it will also take multiple viewings to be able to truly absorb all of the little things because a lot of them pass by so quickly. In response to the ignoranamuses/ignorami(?) who belittle the film for its apparent feminist stance, a careful viewing of the film will put that to rest. Yes, the female characters are strong and have agency, but they are given equal status to the male characters. All you have to do is look at the patriarchal society led by Immortan Joe and the Many Mothers. In both power structures, the absence of the other has led them down a precarious path that is only rectified when they (Max and Furiosa) realize that they have to work together in order to survive. The basic message of the film is redemption is only possible through mutual respect and teamwork. Of course, there's all of the action. Seeing as the film is basically a two-hour chase, there are quite a few set-pieces which only get better as the film progresses. And what makes this even more glorious is that these were accomplished in a largely practical manner (with a couple notable exceptions). And because endless action would wear you out, there are a few brief moments of respite where the philosophical underpinnings of the film are made a little bit clearer. Taken as a whole, MAD MAX FURY ROAD is perhaps one of the most complete action films, and a perfectly good example of what Hitchcock termed 'pure cinema' (and was also a term used by Miller in promotion for the film). My only complaint is that some of the dialogue is a little bit silly, and isn't helped by some occasionally stilted delivery. However, that's a minor quibble when considering how fully realized the film is. George Miller has come back with a vengeance and shown the imitators how its done, even besting (in my opinion) the high mark set by his original trilogy. Do yourself a favor and see this for yourself if you haven't already (or again, if you have).",9,1,10,6 September 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An improvement over REVENGE, but still rather tiresome
","Isn't Transformers supposed to be fun? The first one was, and even though the second one went overboard with the toilet humor, it still had its moments. To this threequel's credit, the story is better and more disciplined, though. The first 20 minutes set up an intriguing premise about the 'real' reason for the moon landings. Yet it never really follows through with it. After that pre-title sequence it's back to the usual with Sam and company as they try to stop the Decepticons' latest (and greatest?) scheme. For what it's worth, Michael Bay reined in some of his baser tendencies. Sam's parents get a whole lot less screen time, and he ditched the racist Autobots from the previous installment. Also, since he shot this in 3D this forced him to tidy up the camera-work and editing. The visual effects also top everything that came before it. There are some really jaw-dropping visuals that probably looked amazing on a cinema screen, and still looked pretty awesome on my HDTV. On the casting side, he got some more veteran actors to do glorified cameos and add legitimacy to an otherwise mostly talent-starved ensemble. However, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime was a stroke of genius (along with an obligatory Star Trek reference/quote). What didn't work in the film's favor was the tiresome and endless nature of the carnage and destruction. The last hour of the film is basically an extended action sequence, and it was a chore to sit through. The human drama is clichéd at best, insipidly stupid at worst. Michael Bay certainly doubled down on why the films have been so popular, but it seems like he forgot to make it a little more enjoyable. As a result, lengthy stretches of action were rendered boring and depressing. The score didn't help matters much either. Like the previous two, Michael Bay was content to use the kernel of a good idea and slather it with visual effects and mindless action. He knows his audience, to be sure, but his cynicism is on full display here. TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON corrects some of the more egregious missteps of its predecessor, but it unfortunately loses its soul in the process.",5,2,7,9 July 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," A slightly lesser, but nevertheless eminently watchable sequel
","In this sequel to the well-received BOURNE IDENTITY, two years have passed and Jason Bourne is still trying to piece together events from his past. However, his relatively peaceful, off-the-grid existence is disturbed when he is framed for murder and drawn out of hiding. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY takes what worked about the first film and builds upon it here. There's more of the great action sequences and intelligence agency intrigue, which actually forms the basis for this movie's plot. The curtain is also pulled back further on Bourne's past and a few more questions are answered. In general, this film stacks up with the previous one, at least on a narrative level. Still, the change in director from Doug Liman to Paul Greengrass is noticeable. Paul Greengrass has a distinct visual style that makes extensive use of hand-held/shaky camera-work, which has mixed results here. One instance of where it does work is early on in a tense, score-less hand-to-hand fight in an apartment. The camera-work there gives a sense of chaos and a feeling of disorientation that adds to the drama of the scene. One example where it doesn't quite work is a climactic car chase through the streets of Moscow. Here, there is a noticeable drop in comprehensibility, and the editing is rather hit-or-miss. As far as the cast is concerned, everyone gives a good performance as usual. In the last entry, I complained slightly about Julia Stiles' character, but here her performance is improved although her character isn't given too much screen time here either. Since the plot revolves around intelligence agency intrigue and eastern European geopolitics (to an extent), those roles are somewhat expanded. There is also a new character played by Joan Allen who serves as Deputy Director. Her presence adds another layer to the proceedings, and adds some additional complexity to story elements already established in the first film. At times it felt like her character was being mistreated simply because she was a woman, but those types of organizations do tend to be 'good ole boys clubs' (or whatever the proper term is). The score this time around is mostly just as good, although there were some techno aspects to it that I didn't like as much. However, they did use the same Moby song during the closing credits that they used in the first one. Overall, I thought this was an excellent, if slightly lesser, sequel. Even though the directing reins changed hands, it felt like the overall continuity was kept. I definitely recommend seeing this, especially if you're a fan of the series.",8,3,4,14 November 2014
The Great Gatsby," Flashy adaptation of a seminal American novel
","Baz Luhrmann has crafted a feast for the eyes and ears in his opulent adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous novel. Having never read the book, I can't judge the film on its faithfulness to the source material. And also having never seen the 1970's film version with Robert Redford, I can't compare it to that either. So as a standalone film, THE GREAT GATSBY mostly works. Despite from anachronistic soundtrack choices, they still felt in tune with how the 1920's might have seemed to those living in that time period. As for period-appropriate selections, I liked the usage of George Gershwin, particularly 'An American in Paris' which serves as a nice reference to F. Scott Fitzgerald, and other members of 'The Lost Generation.' Visually, the movie is stunning with great attention paid to detail. The only areas I felt lacking was in some of the pacing and the thematic department. The early scenes with parties play fast and hard, with dialogue coming about as fast as one could comprehend it. It is a bit of a head trip, but it wouldn't be so jarring if the movie didn't slow down to a crawl once the melodrama takes over. I also felt that the whole 'new money vs. old money' angle could have been explored a little more. As it stands, the film merely scratches the surface of its characters rather than delving in and attempting to understand any of them, except for maybe the titular Gatsby. However, I do think the movie did a good job of portraying excess. Overall, it's stylistically brilliant but the story could have used some more fine-tuning and attempted to explore its characters more than it did for a 130-ish minute movie. Going in, I wasn't expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised which made for an enjoyable viewing experience.",7,2,3,14 November 2014
The Birds," Ahead of its time in more than one way
","Leave it up to Hitchcock to find the horror in something ordinary, but he did just that with THE BIRDS. This also happens to be the first Hitchcock film I ever saw. From what I can remember I thought it was fine, but nothing really spectacular. Now having seen it for the second time, with a lot more film-watching under my belt, I feel like I appreciate it more for what it is, what it meant to cinema going forward, and as a part of Hitchcock's oeuvre. Like all of Hitchcock's films, it takes a simple premise, in this case a socialite who follows a potential boyfriend to his family's small hometown, and while there birds start attacking. On the surface, and for most of the people in the audience, this is probably enough and Hitchcock would probably have agreed. However, there is more to the film than the innovative score and still-impressive visual effects. THE BIRDS also works as a metaphor for the (apparently) rising violence in modern society. Along the way, a few themes are recycled from previous efforts such as SABOTEUR and PSYCHO, but the film I feel is the closest kin would be SHADOW OF A DOUBT. In that film, you have menace coming to a small town in the form of a person, and everything turns out alright in the end. Here, we see menace come to a small town again, but something even more innocent on the surface and more pervasive; and, in a rather pessimistic turn, the ending is left ambiguous. I'm not sure if Hitchcock intended the film to be read this way, but in a world where people are afraid of getting shot when out at the theater or, in a more abstract sense, being the victims of terror attacks, THE BIRDS couldn't be more thematically relevant today, perhaps even more so than when it first came out. And really, that's the beauty of Hitchcock. He was able to tap into the human psyche and fear in a way that few others can (or could). From a technical perspective, the film perhaps doesn't hold up as well, but you can hardly hold that against it. Sure, the visual effects aren't as believable as some modern CGI, but they're still rather effective. Yes, Hitchcock's reliance on rear projection can be distracting at times, but that's a feature of his work I've begrudgingly come to accept. What isn't so forgivable is the downgrade in acting talent from his previous pictures. Tippi Hedren is serviceable as Melanie Daniels, and does get a nice character arc, but she's no Grace Kelly or Kim Novak. Rod Taylor (Mitch) is a handsome face, and not a whole lot more; and hopefully I never have to see the child actress who plays his sister Cathy in anything else. By contrast, Jessica Tandy did well in her supporting role as Mitch's mother. What was most impressive to me was the experimental score (supervised by Bernard Herrmann) that was used in lieu of traditional orchestration. Often, some of my favorite moments in other Hitchcock films have been ones with little to no music, and the effect here of having a mixture of simulated and real bird sounds was chilling at times. There was also more ominous moments, like the well-known sequence that shows a children's jungle gym completely overtaken by a murder of crows and, of course, a literal bird's eye view of an explosion that shows the birds moving in for the kill. Overall, I can comfortably say that I liked this film a lot more on second viewing and it definitely ranks up with Hitchcock's best.",8,3,5,12 August 2015
Beetlejuice," The first true film from 'Tim Burton, auteur' -- and a very entertaining one, too
","I don't remember ever seeing this movie when I was a kid, but I did watch some episodes of the animated series around that time. BEETLEJUICE is an important film for at least one reason: It established Tim Burton's style and featured a lot of the people, behind and in front of the camera, who he would collaborate with over the next 20 years or so. It also has a fairly entertaining story with plenty of visual inventiveness and some manic touches, courtesy of Michael Keaton as the titular character. However, similar to Silence of the Lambs, the most important character in the movie isn't in it for a long time. He gets hinted about at first and shown from behind, making you curious as to what could make the dead so scared of him, but then he finally makes his grand appearance and it all makes sense. For so grating a character, the small doses you get of him actually work in the film's favor. A little bit goes a long way. What makes the film engaging and relatable are the couple who die barely ten minutes in (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) and the daughter of the couple who move in afterwards and start remodeling (Winona Ryder). To a degree, you can understand the plight of these two people who, cut down in their prime, see the house they worked so hard to get be changed beyond recognition by a family with no regard for the past (albeit, hilariously so). One thing I didn't expect was the way in which the film straddles the line between horror and comedy, having expected something a little more straightforwardly funny. What I got was still quite good, with plenty of sight-gags and situational humor instead of verbal punchlines. The film also has a great sense of style (courtesy of production designer, Bo Welch), and Tim Burton's love of German Expressionist cinema becomes more apparent in his realization of the limbo world of the dead, with its long hallways and angled, off-kilter doors and windows. There was also brilliant use of stop-motion animation and models, which are still more involving than CGI will ever be. All of the performances were great, and the characters well-written enough as to be likable even while occasionally doing annoying things. The only thing that works against the film are perhaps the rushed beginning and a slightly forced (and equally rushed) ending. I can understand wanting to get to the good stuff, but a little more time with the protagonists could have only benefited the film overall. So, for not quite delivering the riotous comedy I expected, BEETLEJUICE is still a highly entertaining showcase for special effects and Michael Keaton's manic energy, as well as being Tim Burton's first true film (or at least emblematic of his style).",8,1,1,2 April 2016
The Soloist," Decent film hampered by a lack of focus and tonal confusion
","I went in not knowing what to expect, and what I got was mediocre. The big thing for me is that the movie sometimes couldn't decide what it wanted to be. I mean, you'd have moments of slapstick juxtaposed with moments that were obviously trying to be genuinely emotional. And for me, the only emotional parts were the instrumental sections. Outside of that, I don't think the movie really found any focus, which I see as it's biggest problem. Also, many moments which could have been serious were ruined by unintentional humor on the part of Jamie Foxx's characterization. Other than that, it wasn't too bad of a movie, but not one that I would really want to see again.",6,0,0,14 November 2014
The Fighter," Conventional, but effective - a perfect match of performers with material
","While it certainly isn't too original in it's approach to the material, THE FIGHTER is a technically proficient film with knock-out performances by Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. Based on true events, Mark Wahlberg plays 'Irish' Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts who has a great aspirations but little so far to show for them. Christian Bale plays his brother, Dicky Eklund, also a (former) boxer, who trained him. He also happened to be addicted to crack and had numerous run-ins with the law. Even though the film had some great, intense boxing sequences, what really stood out to me was the dramatic aspect of it. The central conflict is drawn between Micky and his family who manage him and support him, yet somehow might be holding him back. The backlash that comes after he decides to start working with other people in order to get ahead felt very real, if a little melodramatic at times. Amy Adams also has a really great role as Charlene, Micky's girlfriend. But the clear standout of the cast is Christian Bale, who puts everything into his portrayal of Micky's wayward older brother Dicky. While Micky is most likely the 'fighter' of the title, Dicky is no less a fighter himself who hits bottom and fights his way back from addiction. One scene in particular was really eye-opening, as Dicky is in prison and watching an HBO documentary about him (or at least he thinks it is). Once he finds out what the documentary is actually about, he makes a change in himself that has implications for the rest of the film. When all is said and done, this was the kind of sports movie that I like: the one that isn't just about sports. At its core is a family drama about two brothers that really hits home on an emotional level, even if it sticks to convention. I'd kind of like to think of this as David O. Russell's RAGING BULL. Overall, if you like a good sports drama or boxing movie, you can't go wrong with this one.",7,0,0,6 February 2015
From Here to Eternity," What is more eternal than love and brotherhood?
","Its power may have waned a little bit since it first came out over 50 years ago, but FROM HERE TO ETERNITY still remains one of the classic war films as well as an interesting look into military life circa 1941. The story follows a handful of characters whose lives all intersect in Hawaii during the months prior to the bombing at Pearl Harbor. You have Montgomery Clift as Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt: a loner with a troubled past, Burt Lancaster as Sgt. Warden: a tough, but understanding NCO, Deborah Kerr as Karen Holmes: the company commander's wife, and Frank Sinatra as Angelo Maggio: a wiry Italian fellow who befriends Prewitt and loves to drink. As was typical for films of the period, there is a romantic/melodramatic element which forms the basis for the story and informs the way we see the characters. This aspect was kind of dated, but it allows the casual viewer a window into these characters' lives the way a straight military picture couldn't have done. The two main romantic narrative threads are between Montgomery Clift and a girl, Loreen/Alma (Donna Reed) who works at a club he frequents, and Burt Lancaster with Deborah Kerr. Both of these couples lament the situation that life has put them in and desire to get away from it all. Montgomery Clift has become the target of cruel treatment based on his decision not to join the company's boxing team, while Donna Reed's character has grown weary of her employment at a gentleman's club where she has to entertain service members. Parallel to that, Burt Lancaster romances the wife of his CO, a philanderer who has lost interest in her. One common element is the desire to return to the States and get married, which would provide the stability that they all want. However, fate has other plans as the bombing at Pearl Harbor throws their somewhat stable world into chaos and the men of the Army must put aside petty differences to fight the bigger enemy. These are rather heady themes to be tackled in a film that could easily have been a fluff piece for the Armed Forces, yet FROM HERE TO ETERNITY never feels like propaganda. The biggest thing on its mind seems to be portraying what happens when something unexpected throws our best-laid plans into disarray. When that happens, the best we can do is to band together and make the best of a bad situation. In the end, our commitment to each other will outlast any temporary plans that we have. Overall, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY does feel 'of its time' but it's also the only Pearl Harbor film worth watching.",7,3,4,10 March 2015
V for Vendetta," Still holds up rather well
","It had been a while since I'd seen this movie, so the time was right to revisit it. While it has lost a little of its power in the years since, there's no denying that it is still one of the most entertaining and provocative movies of the 21st century. Recounting the plot is almost pointless now, as most everyone who's into movies knows it at this point. What I can say is that all of the performances are excellent, in particular Hugo Weaving as V. Despite having a mask over his face, or being obscured through darkness, he manages to give a performance with a lot of depth and nuance. He might represent an idea or symbol, but he brings humanity to his character and more than a little bit of wit (and wordplay). I still think that Natalie Portman is the weak link in the cast, but she isn't terrible, by any means. As far as the technical aspects go, most of the special effects still hold up rather well and the film, as a whole, is beautifully shot. There's also some variation on the bullet-time effect that the Wachowskis popularized with their Matrix trilogy (and who wrote this screenplay). James McTeigue, the director and long-time Wachowski collaborator, did his finest directing work with this film in my opinion. Overall, with an engaging, well-acted story that has still has relevant political themes, you can't get much better than this. And may this film never be forgot.",9,1,3,6 December 2014
The Island," Michael Bay's last good movie
","Outside of THE ROCK, this is probably the best film that Michael Bay has done to date. Is it a great movie? Not especially, but it's about the best you can ask for when all of the typical Michael Bay elements are mixed together with a concept and story that, while borrowing heavily from previous sci-fi films, is still somewhat intelligent and thought-provoking. The story is about a man (Ewan McGregor) who lives inside a utopian facility when, one day, he figures out that he and the other inhabitants are just being used to harvest organs. He also escapes with a woman (Scarlett Johansson) who is about to be sent to 'The Island.' The whole movie is basically set up to be a series of chase sequences, but it works because the concept is interesting enough and you care enough to want to find out what is going on, and why. For the most part, Michael Bay was on his best behavior here when it came to his sense of 'humor.' There were some stereotyped characters here and there, but nothing as pervasive as what would follow in his Transformers series. By now, his visual style was well-established, but it still wasn't so chaotic that you couldn't tell what was going on in any given frame. The performances were decent, and nobody stuck out as being really bad. I thought Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson did good work as the two leads, and Sean Bean made for a nice villain. Djimon Hounsou also did a good job as a bounty hunter on the trail of the two lead characters, and who also has a nice character arc. Returning back to the visuals, there was more CGI than in past Michael Bay films, but nothing too over-the-top or excessive. There was also a fair amount of practical effects work and plenty of well-done explosions (for those are into that sort of thing). Granted, these type of movies often push the bounds of suspension of disbelief when it comes to the relationship with physical reality, but it was still entertaining on a visceral level. The score by Steve Jablonsky and Hans Zimmer was also pretty good, and accentuated the visuals and action quite nicely. However, one thing that became much more clear to me while watching this is that Michael Bay is basically an assembly-line director. There are certain elements which always be in movies that he makes. Some of them, like his chaotic camera-work and penchant for explosions are fine in moderation while others, like his voyeuristic obsession with the female form and juvenile sense of humor, would be better if left out entirely. Thankfully, there's not too much here in terms of the latter two. Also, like a lot of summer blockbusters, there's an obligatory romantic subplot. Yes, I lament that nearly all action movies have to shoehorn this element in, but I thought it was handled tastefully here, and not just there for the sake of being there. Overall, this is most fun I've had watching a Michael Bay movie, outside of THE ROCK. In fact, I'd say that those two are tied for my favorite. The story is engaging, even if derivative, and the action keeps things moving along at a good clip such that I didn't feel the 135 minute run time as much. There's something here, even for people who don't quite take to Michael Bay's style, and it's a pretty good sci-fi/action movie to boot.",8,1,1,14 November 2014
Furious 7," About as good as mindless popcorn entertainment gets
","I'm quite a latecomer to the FAST & FURIOUS franchise, having gotten on with the fourth entry, but not really liking it until FAST FIVE. Here we are, seven films in, the series has morphed into something else entirely different from the street racing formula it started as. While the previous two were heist films, FURIOUS 7 goes into full superhero mode. I mean, can nothing kill these people? Still, once you embrace the absurdity there's a lot of fun to be had with the over-the-top action and quip-making. The plot, as if it really matters, involves Dom and his team going after Deckard Shaw, who is hunting them down because of what they did to his brother in the previous movie. It's actually an interesting dual family dynamic that, sadly, isn't really played up save for one scene at the beginning. That's also the scene where we're introduced to just how bada** that Shaw is by seeing the aftermath of what he did to the hospital where his brother is staying. Sadly, nothing in the rest of the film lives up to that level of awesome. Along the way, the team has to extract a hacker so that they can get some incredible piece of technology that will help them find Shaw. However, the 'God's Eye' is merely a plot-driving MacGuffin that extends the running time, and kind of useless because Shaw just keeps showing up where Dom and company are anyway as the plot requires. And that's generally the biggest problem with FURIOUS 7: it relies too heavily and coincidence and convenience to drive the story. Still, the film delivers on the action it promises. Big time. The coolest stunt in the whole film is probably where they parachute cars down onto a mountain, which looked to be achieved practically (at least part of it). I can only imagine what an adrenaline rush it would have been to see it on a premium format screen (like IMAX), but it was still effective on my laptop. But, for my money, the film's best action sequence takes place in Abu Dhabi. James Wan, best known until now for directing low-budget horror films, was at his directorial best here deftly cutting between concurrent action sequences and witty banter courtesy of Roman (Tyrese). After this show-stopping segment, the final 'street fight' was almost anti-climactic by comparison. As for the lulls between the action, there was plenty of talk about family as is typical for the series. Yet, none of it really felt genuine until the emotional final scene which pays tribute, and says farewell, to Paul Walker. That moment alone, out of all the other similar ones throughout the series, was heartfelt and touching without being clichéd. So, is this highbrow entertainment? Heck no! But, it knows what it is and delivers what the target audience wants.",7,1,13,27 September 2015
