Walk the Line," More about Joaquin
","The first time I even noticed Joaquin was in Walk the Line, which I loved. I now own 8 Joaquin movies...absolutely loved his interview on Oprah and those darling expressions on his face!!! I agree with another comment that he was robbed of the Oscar. Much to my distress I just read that Joaquin doesn't believe in God and that really disturbs me. I hope all Christians out there will pray that Joaquin will come to know the saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. I also hope and pray that he will stop cussing in movies!!! A lot of his movies are full of cuss words which adds nothing to the plot and makes it very annoying to watch. I love Ladder 49, Signs, The Village, Inventing the Abbotts, It's All About Love, but I found Clay Pigeons to be very offensive. I just love Joaquin and want the best for his life....Can't wait to see his next movie but it will be awhile since he's not made a movie since Walk. Love you Joaq!!!",Null,0,1,20 April 2006
