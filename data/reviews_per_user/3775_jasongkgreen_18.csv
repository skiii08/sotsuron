Ford v Ferrari," Turbo charged!
","Nice surprise at the Cineworld secret screening with this. Bale and Damon have great chemistry. I struggled with Bale's UK Northern accent occasionally, but a story of risk, achievement and friendship, with some great driving scenes. Would recommended, especially for any race fans.

Moneyball," Nearly out the park!
","Baseball team with no money, comes good due to their method, personalities and winning spirit. It's a sporting underdog tail, with a good dose of testosterone, a soup√ßon of feel-good and a sprinkle of schmaltz. Almost bereft of woman! Although a nice bit of father daughter-ness to add humanity.Brad Pitt and Jonas Hill are both very good. Brad one of his better performances and far to manly than should be allowed.This is no earth shattering experience, but I enjoyed it very much. It's the sort of film that floats my boat, or maybe 'hits my ball'!Worthy watch. 7/10",7,0,0,11 February 2019
First Man," Spacious.
","A large movie, with big shots of space, rockets and sky's. A great musical score and gravitas throughout. Neil's cold, calculating drive shows why he was 'the man'. The director does well showing just how difficult and risky this all was, leading to some great tension. I was left feeling in awe of the achievements and feeling I knew Neil in as much as you could know a cold and calculating man. A worthy watch with some wonderful music and scenes, not held back by long pauses and dramatic silence. 7/10",7,2,5,12 October 2018
Rocketman," He's Still Standing!
","The story of a damaged individual trying to come to terms with themselves and their subsequent addiction is not a new story. However, not many of those folk live a life like Elton's. Producing hit after hit with Bernie like shelling peas.This is a film first but a musical second, and what a score. Genuine goose bump moments, one hum dinger in a early first major performance.A hell of a strong cast, with really too many to mention, the casting of Taron Egerton as Elton was genius.This is a moving story, which flew past and really is as good as the reviews imo. Loved it, a really strong 8.Elton's popularity will really expand with this. Get on it!",8,43,86,21 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Warning - Contains a Perfect movie moment!
","Saw the film on Friday 5th October after excellent reviews, being fans of both leads and loving a good film score. I guessed this would be a winner for me and my wife. Here we are on Monday, and it still keeps popping into my head and we are still talking about it. The first musical coming together with the performance of 'Shallow' is a perfect movie moment. Goose bumps a plenty. Both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper out do each other, both show huge talent in their acting, singing and general goodlookingness. There are moments such as a wounded Bradley where his look and silence says more than words ever could. Fabulous music, joyous, haunting and painful goose bump delivery. It will no doubt be showered in awards. Highly recommended. 9/10",9,2,5,8 October 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Ebbing and Flowing.
","Well, got around to this finally. Clever, polished, some superb characters and acting. Frances McDormand leading the way, but many others following close behind. Still, I feel slightly lost within it. I just knew the end would leave me unfinished as characters move off in mid life story to find their futures.If a film that leaves you thinking is the goal, with powerhouse performances and atmosphere a plenty in a beautifully made piece of work. Sign up.",8,0,2,17 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Really did 'Rock Me'.
","Wow.No really. Firstly what about the critic reviews? I can see the thoughts but think they miss the point. The feeling. I have heard:'It didn't go as far as it could'
'It's like a trailer for the film'
'It wasted an opportunity'Then there are the public reviews at 8.4 out of 10 as I write this. If you like Queen music (who doesn't) you are onto a winner already.I felt moved on numerous occasion. Rami Malek was superb. He took some growing into those teeth, but a performance that made me think at times I was watching Freddie. The rest of the band and 'supporting' actors were excellent, and as I expected them to be as characters.Yes I think the story was somewhat 'cleansed' as it would be. These are Freddie's 'family' involved in making this, directing it. But a great story, sensitive and left me missing Freddie, emotional and taken on roller coaster of wonderful, nostalgic Queen music. The 'Live Aid' is sensational.I loved it, and recommend it highly. 9/10",9,3,4,3 November 2018
Yesterday," Great music, Sweet film with floors.
","I enjoyed this, it was light, fun 'chewing gum' film.Great music (Beatles obviously), the leads were entertaining (Lily James was adorable, even with bad hair) . A nice love story and a good few laughs.It was entertaining, ridiculous and had a few acting bits or plot lines that made you role your eyes. But all in all, I was glad I saw it, it gets a 7/10 for a worthy and feel good film.Thanks for reading.",7,1,11,20 June 2019
Climax," Experiential viewing. You have been warned!
","Well. If you are after an experience, I guess this is one. Like a night when you really pushed the boundaries on drink or drugs and you're at the stage when you either need to be sick or walk it off, either way, it's a long night.This is a film about expressive dance, colour palette, drugs and primitive release. It walks the line between nonsense and art.It has shades of Suspiria but is not as refined, it is harsh, like nails down a chalk board at times.It's certainly a trip, I felt I lost balance watching it at some point!Sound up your street? This is no easy watch but worthy for the dance, colour and experience.You have been warned.7/10",7,3,4,18 June 2019
The Favourite," A Favourite Film Experience.
","I felt slightly 'spun out' by this film, in a good way. It was simple and complex. The staccato repetitive notes and lavish classical scores were beautiful and heightened the pressure of the scenes. Sometimes this felt almost too much temporal pressure.The beautiful scenery and buildings, Hatfield House and Hampton Court Palace providing opulent and fitting settings for the majesty of some of the performances. Most of which seem professional and proficient, Olivia Coleman's decaying character showing her damage beautifully both inside and out and we get a glimpse of the pain of her history. Her acting is sublime.'Some wounds do not close; I have many such.' Queen AnneRachel Weisz was the choice after Kate Winslet to play Lady Sarah, a superior choice for this role in my opinion, with harder edges. It took much of the film until I noticed Rachel's beauty as her character was so convincing and managed to conceal it well.Emma Stone as Abigail was an equal and did incredibly well to not be out shined by this stunning cast. I loved her character, driven and single minded. Beautiful and practical. I suspect Olivia will win the prizes but these three have no apprentice in each other.I loved the eloquent use of the English language, clipped yet with great use of profanity. Beautiful uses of the C bomb! These gift some of the best laughs and there are a few.The history and view of parliament and royalty, class and status, pomp, ridiculous outfits and beautiful dresses, fascinated and helped the sumptuous feel.All this and a masterful tragic victory, the final scene so powerful yet left me bereft. This is an esculent, luscious and complex film with an acting masterclass and experience.8/10 Treat yourself.",8,2,3,4 January 2019
Aladdin," No Genie'us üòïüëç
","Saw this yesterday. I thought it was pretty good and worth a watch. Good production, some great effects and cinematography. Will Smith did really well as the Genie. I couldn't shake Robin Williams from my mind, but Will made it very much his own.Would I say yes to the re-make, no. But that aside, it was a pretty good watch.",7,1,5,27 May 2019
Good Will Hunting," 'It's not your fault'
","Not many films make make me shed a tear. This film moves me.A young genius and his challenges in life and love, learning to combat his own damage and use his abilities or destroy himself.Yes, it has some tiny defects, some obviousness. But what a cast, Matt Damon and Minnie Driver are chemically alive. Look for the 'if you say you don't love me scene' it's sublime. They are kids in this, but their acting is ageless.Robin Williams parental, warm and loving role, makes you want the hug, and the indelible and repeated line 'it's not you fault' is hard to describe. It's a 'moment'. RIP. Robin. This film makes me sad you left.Stellan Skarsg√•rd plays a great role, the skill in which means I don't love him, but the perfect role compliment Robin and Matt and a deft job.The rest of the cast contains supporting actors which could easily be leads, with Ben and Casey Affleck are perfect in their roles as buddies.Some films show you the magick in movies, this is one. Simple human concepts with, great cinematography, and wonderful acting. A near perfect film.Watch it. 9/10",9,2,3,1 March 2019
A Quiet Place," Shhh....
","Quick review:A family in a post apocalyptic world, having to survive a new terror. A film about a world of survival which involves, 'being quiet' which is really a film about love, relationships and children...and being quiet!This is more than a horror. A clever spin, I loved the 'fullness' of this film, a horror which was more complex and seemed to focus on the story.The results had me holdings my breath, even after the film had ended. I love the concept.Unsurprisingly with such a class cast, the main roles were strong, all parties playing their parts skilfully. It is hard to pull one out even with Emily Blunt.The use of children was clever and not over cooked and brought real humanity to a story that could other wise be less than.This film is more than a horror. It was moving, TENSE, scary with great acting and music.Highly recommended. Loved it. 8/10.",8,0,0,4 March 2019
The Fountain," Interesting, musical, arty weirdness!
","Been meaning to see this for sometime. Heard someone say it was their favourite film recently and wax lyrical about it so though it was time.I can understand why it is was averagely rated by critics and slated by some humans as tosh, others as amazing. It's several stories intertwined (3 in fact). Visual with effecting music. About love, and the efforts from Hugh Jackman to save his soul mate (Rachel Weisz) from death. It's ethereal and not light hearted, love, illness, death and the tree of life!I enjoyed it, I am a generous audience. It was interesting and thought provoking in places. I liked the visuals and music. The leads were capable.Favourite quote:
Isabel: For every shadow, no matter how deep, is threatened by morning light.If you like a slightly trippy, occasional head scratchy, but interesting films. Give it a whirl. If arty, visual, weird concept films, don't float your boat. Pass it by.",7,4,6,6 February 2019
It Chapter Two," Chapter 2....3...4...5...etc!
","6/10 for me:Horror fan and I'm usually a generous audience too!Far too much fat. It's not The Godfather, it's a horror! Meandering story, short stories lead by visual effects. A few laughs, some good effects, but the story was weak. Lots of money, not enough content. üëç",6,2,3,14 September 2019
12 Strong," Everyman wishes he was a soldier
","So, love a good war film, me too.It's a bit cheesy, USA'd up etc. But if you like a war film it has it all, good vs evil, against the odds, grunting 'real men' and all against the back drop of 9/11.A worthy story of the heroics and stories that often come from the evil that is war.Thoroughly enjoyed it. 8/10",8,1,1,28 October 2018
Green Book," Thought provoking, funny and warm.
","A worthy watch with the leads pulling off some excellent and endearing characters.A good meaningful thread of racial issues in the Deep South of the US, entwined with the Human story of a lost black man who is a brilliant pianist, stuck between white and black cultures and feeling no place in either and a Italian doorman/ hustler with a big heart and a healthy knowledge of what he is and where he is from.Their relationship is warm and human and at times laugh out loud funny. This teachers you stuff with feeling, emotion and entertainment, it has depth but is fun.8/10 for me. A very worthy watch.",8,3,6,4 December 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Turbo charged momentum, spewing fumes.
","Quick review:Watched this on 4K, Dolby Atmos. Third time I've seen it. I can't quite understand what is is about a dystopian vehiclular film where little is said, that appeals. But it does.It's an action film with almost constant movement, a visual feast, glossy and full of some great cinematography and superb stunts. Tom hardy and Charlize Theron are both great and say little. Both trying to 'become' the characters, I suspect with little choice as the characters told you little about who they are.A stunning, dystopian, turbo charged visual feast of a film. I look forward to watching again. 8/10",8,0,2,28 February 2019
