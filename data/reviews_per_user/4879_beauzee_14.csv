Walk the Line," superior bio-pic. > minor complaints
","Cash, a true Sun Records Legend, and the only one to have a decent, I mean great, film made about him. forget about the Jerry Lee and Elvis movies, entertaining but generally useless. Phoenix here gets into the *Soul* of Cash, even gets to 'channel' him vocally...not bad RP! Reese Witherspoon is absolutely fantastic, what an actress and what a portrayal. my 'complaint' is that she apparently was made into a proto feminist and not the person absolutely enchanted by, and ready to marry JC at the drop of a guitar pick.nutha small issue or two: movie runs 10-12 minutes too long. and this Reviewer does not think that June was a solo on Johnny's show for years but a member of the touring Carter Family which INCLUDED Johnny Cash! back to the good stuff: script, direction, acting, editing, cinematography > and now viewers can get a much better perspective on those many, many youtube clips!",9,0,0,29 March 2015
The Irishman," What did I miss ? In freakin 3 and 1/2 hours ? Something was wrong ..
","I surmise Scorsese and Deniro and pesce got together in a smoke filled room and finally decided to put an end to taxi drivers asking 'when you guys gonna make another one?'So they said , 'this should settle everyone down : we'll thrown in everything but the kitchen sink
and tommy 's mothers eggs and sausages!Yes, all the actors are pretty terrific and what a rare chance to watch 'em cook again ! Except there's no ray liotta to cook up any tomato sauce !Ray liotta shoulda coulda played the holy hell outta that union boss ! He even for C-sakes looked like him . But ....no. Al Pacino is fine , yes ....I think this review is getting to be as long as the picture !So I'll say , something's wrong with this thing ...can't really pinpoint how . Let's just say it moves like a soap opera and there's too much about Hoffa ! Is it the Sheeran story or the Hoffa story ?Where was Lorraine Bracco?Somebody PLEASE talk Marty into recutting it for 2 hours and 15 minutes and use the original 3.5 hr. theatre version for bonus material on the DVD. Or do the 2 hr 15 m version as 'new directors cut '.",6,2,4,19 March 2020
Elf," chest nuttiness
","occasionally hilarious Christmas movie...loaded with raucous slapstick, well performed.we all know 'where it's going' from the gitgo and Will Ferrell is up to the task. some of us were raised by wolves...well , Will was raised by Elves...or by Santa...not sure.yes, it turns out he's the biological/full grown pixie son of James Caan, a struggling to stay afloat New York Publishing exec. he needs a sure winner by DEc. 24th or it's the unemployment line on the 26th. will Ferrell just expedite that trip? picture runs a little long...Caan...is it me? he's just not engaged. maybe TIm Allen should have played the Dad. he's not extra animated either, but we *expect* that of him. who knows if Caan intentionally held back to let Ferrell dominate the show? I liked Caan in HONEYMOON IN VEGAS...he should have brought that kind of energy top this flick.absolutely fabulous, breathtaking special effects!",7,1,1,21 December 2014
Interstellar," movie as long as the journey past saturn
","once again, 'Hollywood' has delivered another coulda-shoulda: one hour too long, and in that hour, throwing in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink.seems the Producer/Director Writer have referenced CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THWE THIRD KIND, 2001, OUTLAND, HAVE ROCKET - WILL TRAVEL.their story is something about: the earth's agriculture is drying up, so we better get on the stick (a navigational one for space) because we need to get outta Dodge soon! any decent fish left? OK...well, it turns out that NASA has been sending people into space for quiet a while and an ex-NASA pilot has stumbled into a secret NASA 'war room' - or was he 'called', like the guy from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS THIRD KIND? (this dude in his 40s got an early retirement because of the ongoing bad economy - seems his extraordinary skills were not even marketable!).some have actually settled on planets in another galaxy (see, an unnamed 'helper' has carved out a piece of the sky just beyond SAturn, which is really a catapult to deep space, where habitable spheres exist).if these presumptive aliens know about our agriculture problem, why don't they just send a few saucers down to meet with the Secretary of Agriculture, and leave them a disk with all the instructions on how to turn it all around? > Space is great, but why not make it simple? very interesting Science is also presented, though > our Hero must deal with the reality that when he returns to Earth, his Daughter is 42 and so is he. he finds other more serious challenges, however, while en route...and this kind of stuff is pupil dilating. will his exploration create any detours to throw his 'schedule' off course? Michael caine, Ellen Burstyn, and JOhn Lithgrow are the only actors I recognize..oh yeah..the quiet dude from the Lincoln commercials. He is as expressive in this 2 .5 hr. epic as he is staring straight ahead, in a more mundane form of transportation. The only bad acting job here is by the star. When he finally cracks a smile, the Gentleman Quarterly stud looks like Soupy Sales. (not a bad thing). All the rest of the cast is just fine. I hope their checks cleared.",6,1,3,10 January 2015
Forrest Gump," he better run...after all them chocolates!!!
","ho did he ever manage to enlist in the Army? okay, okay...we have some of the best movie making ever, in the first hour or so...then we veer off into 7 other movies.the character has an IQ of 75 but his intellect does not account for his, shall we say, humanitarian IQ. are we supposed to wonder...is he such a moral, courageous man because he does not deal at all in adult social complexities and just reacts? is he a 'savant', in that as 'dumb' as he is, intellectually, he can accomplish things that 'average' people cannot, simply because they *think* too much? I wondered if his running ability is half 'transferred' skill (what he lacks in real brainpower he gains in braunpower?).we are given not one porterhouse steak here but two...meaning, too much is too much. Like Fred Blassie once said, you see women wrestling two nites in a row, by the third?.....nah. should the Director/Writer simply presented the greatest human running machine in history > cannot possibly break a sweat, stopping his run only for food and nature calls? well, he is the world's greatest runner, a War Hero, a multi-million dollar entrepreneur...and he's got a hot hippie chick n the back burner, too! I think the creators referenced MARATHON MAN, BEING THERE, that DUSTIN Hoffman movie where he plays the 'counting' marvel.the two disc set does not include the deleted footage where Gump meets Jesus. :)",7,1,1,8 January 2015
Flashdance," Kind of 'Made For TV' budget 'Fame'...'80s nostalgia!
","Jennifer Beals kicks up her heals high, or as high as possible, in this slice of life from 1980s Manhattan, and the blue collar dreamers, incl., comfortable construction workers (Beal) who struggle to make in on Broadway.She jumps into the sack on the first (Or second, I don't remember) date, with her Boss, who is about 14 years older than she. Sexy scene. I am assuming she was playing an 18 year old character (she looks about 16) because she works on a construction site.Making great money, in a 'non traditional job' (expression then for women working in a profession dominated by men), will not satisfy her soul! Her boss/lover/svengali has connections. Will he use them to help her? See the movie.And enjoy esp. the performances of Ron Karabatsos, a Union City Policeman, turned actor, here as a Club owner; and Phil Bruns, of the old Jackie Gleason Show (American Scene Magazine) and too many movies and sitcoms, to list here. Note a short cameo by Anne Meara, wife of Seinfeld actor, Jerry Stiller.THis movie made we wanna break out my VHS tapes of MTV!",Null,0,0,31 May 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," not one wasted frame....buy this DVD
","astonishing directorial and literary work > story itself is engrossing and when Pacino and Cazale (both from THE GODFATHER, II) lock-in, it's an instant perennial.although the premise and plot have universal application, this is very much 'New York' > all pomposity aside, we original Easterners have met these characters somewhere, on the subway, in a coffee shop.the audience's empathy (and that of the supporting characters at the bank) pull us in...we almost forget these guys are fooling around with loaded rifles in a tight space.I was drawn in right to the point when the police 'manipulated' the surrender...no spoiler here.Pacino is understated, as is Cazale...which brings out the underlying, physical and emotional tension.",10,1,2,17 December 2014
Lincoln," what acting, what detail......
","the minutae of every day life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue....balanced against the towering, overwhelming events outside. kudos to the cinematographer and costume designer, especially.love almost *any* Lincoln project: movie, documentary, et al. I think we all agree that the Lincoln-Civil War years, in whatever medium, have a way of making even the greatest historians humble...the more you learn, the less you know.I still wanna know why Abe just sat there writing poetry while the South walked right past his door, in 1863, en route to the hell basin in Pennsylvania. sorry, I know.......negatives: poor portrayal of Todd, made to look weak and none too bright; anachronistic feminism by Fields (Mary worshipped the boots he walked in); bizarre final scene with Jones....but see the movie.",8,2,3,20 November 2014
Love & Mercy," rock bio can't get much better...
","most rock biopics are ...pretty lame, wouldn't you say? terrible timeline, no analysis of the music > although I gotta say, other than the flashbacks, I had no idea what year or years we were in...and Cusack's 'older' appearance did not help, all due respect to a fabulous actor.another small 'downer' 4 me: once again, we get a gender-adjusted screenplay, where the smart and sexy, 35-ish, woman scorned, 'nurses', lifts, or restores the manchild , here genius Brian Wilson.wonderful performance by the actor who played the semi-quack Doctor-Mentor...funny that I left the theatre not *hating* him. where were the Brothers? why did they apparently leave it all to him? with all their experience in sex, drugs, and rock and roll, why trust ANYONE who is allowed to 'medicate' someone? I was reminded of Dr. Nick, Presley's doctor. anyone watch HIS *ss? the Wilson Doctor said he did manage to get a 300 pound mess of a man out of bed and down to a healthy weight. that was far from enough, of course. but it was something. And Wilson was a 'druggie' long before this dude showed up. no excuses for his immoral over-reach ...not gonna play spoiler here but watch for the near-ending when his 'evolved' relationship w Brian, became a purely financial one.see this movie.",9,0,3,12 July 2015
The Godfather: Part III," worth seeing 3-4 times (not 800 times like its' predecessors)
","film works beautifully for about 40 minutes then goes off in many directions. the scenes at the Vatican are quite compelling and in a way the Director should be commended for showing the guts to express, artistically, how many people feel about Religion in general. It is 'the God business' and its' conceivable that it has had some bad associations.acting is excellent, all around, and yes, I thought Director's daughter did okay.I said above the story goes off too far, geographically *and* dramatically. I won't give away the very unsatisfying ending but will say a much smaller concentration on the Godfather's new, terrible scenario to work through, his 'bastard' nephew's (Father was Sonny) obvious attraction to his daughter, would have made this strong '9'.",6,0,1,7 November 2014
Signs," Gibson is always great...too bad his picture is a pretentious mess
","Special effects and a decently maintained sense of impending doom aside, this is a bad film, full of every 'inspiration' culled from every TV showing of the THE BIRDS, THE WIZARD OF OZ, whatever.science fiction can be terrific but it still has to make SOME non-fiction sense: the lead ET travels how many galaxies to learn that the Earth is made up of 80% water...the one element which can doom him/her/it. yeah, and he travels several 100 light years but can't find his way out of Gibson's broom closet.NO SPOILER HERE, but I'll mention that my lower jaw plummeted when Gibson wakes up refreshed 'the day after'...there's about 39 people left on the planet...but he has seen the light: need lemons if ya want lemonade. please.",2,4,7,1 November 2014
Casino," have watched it only 1,857 times
","amazingly absorbing and detailed, bringing us...DRAGGING US BACK to the 1970s when Vegas was Vegas. (thankfully, no Elvis imitators can be found here). goes without saying, the script, the acting, all the essentials are 'done to a tee', as Pesci says when referring to how he gets his assignments done.obvious comparison with GOODFELLAS....lead is conflicted but macho and the wife/love interest, is also confused but does not get enough frame time! sorry, my fellow & sister fanatics. Sharon Stone won a Golden Globe but really did not get the attention she *or* the character deserved. we see more DeNiro's legs than hers.another issue is that the two leads are somewhat schizophrenic to the point we wonder if there was not enough story conferences before the shoot. in CASINO, Henry Hill is the shall we say reluctant accessory to murder, a guy with a good heart. DeNiro here is a Jewish guy, schooled in 1950s hoodlumism, but his 'Jewishness' is confined unfortunately to the stereotype who lets others fight for him and is actually worried that his best fiend Pesci won't stop filandering with his wife. 'what if he doesn't stop?' he whispers to Stone, in a very bizarre scene.Stone's character is also a mite mixed-up: she can work the system down to carpet fibers in the lounge, is a lying thief like all her friends and clients, but is initially shy on the idea of marrying a multi millionaire who can secure her future 500 times over? think I'll toss my VHS in, one more time, you know, just to review.........................",8,1,2,3 November 2014
The Wedding Singer," great script, acting, SNL faces, lift the all too predictable fluff-line
","sandler is the failed local rock star, now sustaining as local wedding singer. he is an '80s guy, Reagan era exponent > hey, what's wrong with getting married, buying a home, and makin' bucks?! problem is: his chosen one (angela Featherstone) is a dumb as a brick beauty (another Seinfeld actress, who played Jerry's sort of maid), who frivolously decides at the very last minute, not to show up for the kick-off of adam's new life.he meets up with Drew Barrymoore, a waitress at one of his gigs. she too is of a conservative mindset...she is marrying admittedly, for security. hey, security is not bad.but Love conquers all! and not unlike the movie HONEYMOON IN VEGAS, either! we give a few notches DOWN because sandler as part-time piano teacher is really just hinted at and the part of his 'older' student, Ellen Dow (seen on Seinfeld as Pederson's Mother), is quite repugnant. another 'thorn' is in the relationship between Sandler and the 'original' bride to be. she is a silly, frivolous person who he realizes is not worthy....but she *was* worthy for a long time, in fact worthy enough to be his fiancé....the Director might have had Sandler show some kindness at the end (no spoiler). was she all that different from Drew, in the end?",8,3,3,27 December 2014
Goodfellas," how am I funny?.....this whole thing (of theirs) is fabulous
","saw this in the movies in 1990...as I walked back, up the aisle, and to my 1986 Mazda 626, little did I realize it would be the most watched movie of my movie-watching career.the detail, the detail...the butter between slices of Italian bread within reach of the fellas, as they stop off at Pesci's Moms' house to pick up a knife..and wind up picking up 3 pounds as Scorsese's real life mom talks them into a very early breakfast and then provides a floor show: the worst 'religious art' imaginable....you saw the scene (500 times).no complaints..but I will mention that Lorraine Bracco was robbed of frame-time, in my opinion. also...perhaps the soundtrack was a little top heavy with loud hit records, from time to time.buy it..all editions..the 'bulls' will never know.",10,0,0,7 November 2014
