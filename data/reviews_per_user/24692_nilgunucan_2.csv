First Man," They touched the moon but not our feelings !!!
","Actually I forced myself to rate this movie with 6, but I am not sure I may be unfare for the one's which really deserved 6. It looks like it should be 5.I think the problem is not with the actors, it is because of the director. In my opinion he wanted to emphasize the events rather than the feelings of the people. We cannot get any of the joy, sorrow, frustration that should have taken place after the success and failures all through the movie.The editing is really bad, conversations are unsatisfying. Although the movie is unnecessarily long, the feeling for the duration of their flight does not match with the scene that they have mentioned about the total time they are away from home. The vital needs of the crew is not given.If I were able to rate the movie in terms of
. Sound editing, it would be 8. The only good part. I would like to congratulate their success in spite of the director.
. Film editing, it would be 4.
. Visual Effects, 6
. Production design 4",6,1,2,9 January 2019
Green Book," Congratulations for the Cast and Crew !!!
","Congratulations !!!I simply loved it. Everything is given in its dose.Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali play extraordinary. You put yourself into the shoes of both of them. You love each although they are opposite characters. I think it is the success of the director, writers, film editors and of course the actors.Music is the bonus.At this stage the movie raised in my Oscars listing to the top.",9,3,6,12 January 2019
