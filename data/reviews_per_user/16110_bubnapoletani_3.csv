Ford v Ferrari," Historically innaccurate.
","Like many American films this title attempts to rewrite history.
The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre.
This film needs remaking to tell what really happened and who the reall heroes were. They would be wearing red overalls thats for sure.",1,80,196,17 November 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Aged very badly
","What a load of rubbish. Useless script. Useless storyline. Irritating acting. Embarrassing to watch them try actually. Devoid of emotion. Tear inducing, purely from a boredom sense. Pathetic production. Complete failure to allure the viewer. Need I say more. No, I don't think so. Avoid at all costs if you love quality film, and don't wish to waste a couple of hours of your life. Aha, according to the site rules I need to complete ten lines of text for my review to comply with the rules! Hard to write ten lines about such a dire production, so I apologise dear reader for extending my pure loathing of this film to you for longer than necessary. In my attempt to help some people save some valuable time by not watching Shaun of the Dead (sh*t should replace the word Shaun in all honesty) I have had to waste extra time of my own in warning you. I hope this was not in vain, and helps at least 1 other person. Kind regards.",2,1,7,10 August 2014
Midsommar," Twisted
","This is a disturbing film, no doubt about it. However, it would be far more believable if the cult sect was in the USA rather than Sweden. Scandinavia is very advanced therefore it is very hard to believe such brainwashery could occur there.",5,2,3,9 February 2020
