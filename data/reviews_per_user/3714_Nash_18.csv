Vertigo," Hitch's second best
","Vertigo, Alfred Hitchcock's wonderful study of romantic obsession and manipulation, is second only to Rear Window among his many wonderful films like Shadow of a Doubt, North by Northwest, Psycho, Rope, and The 39 Steps.This is the best Jimmy Stewart performance.  Bringing out the dark side of an actor identified with his nice guy roles was another great Hitch contribution to cinema.  This is why people who call Tom Hanks our Jimmy Stewart have no idea what they are saying.  Watch Bonfire of the Vanities if you don't believe me. His obsessive and manipulative 'Scotty' is one of my ten faves of all time.The beautiful and enigmatic Kim Novak is a revelation. The only slight problem I have with this film is it is almost too creepy.  Hitch really confesses about his predelictions about women. A 9.5/1",Null,2,3,1 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Snore fest
",I have to ask fans of this film.  How can you tell yourself itwas even fun?What a bore.  Nothing to get into.  The effects looked fake. The characters were non-existent.  Darth Maul did nothing.  Thescenes that could have been exciting like the saber duel and thepod race were overedited.  Anyone who compares the pod race toBen Hur's chariot race is nuts.A 3 out of 10.  Don't waste your time or money.,Null,0,1,21 September 1999
Casablanca," The Greatest
","An example of everything coming together beautifully.  The great movie of all times.Sure there are more 'important' films, but Casablanca comes so wonderfully together.  It improves every time I watch it. Bogey in his iconic role as Rick.  The gorgeous and subtle Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa.  Another one of the all time greats Claude Raines.  The rest of the cast is perfection. The script is full of romance, humor, drama and suspense.  And the most discussed ending ever.  How many of the pat happy endings from a year ago are discussed and debated still.An A++, see it today.",Null,0,0,6 July 1999
Fight Club," A great film
","Though no American Beauty, one of the years best films.Career defining work from Ed Norton, our Brando, and Brad Pitt. I am so glad he is staying away from being a star.  I like himmore than Johnny Depp.Fincher's direction is top notch and full of visual inovation.Brutally violent and not for the weak.  A low A.",9,0,1,16 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Invetive romantic comedy
","At least we do not have to put up with something as bad as Titanic for a year as best picture.  One of my favorites of the year.  A high A-.Wonderfullly acted for the most part.  Gwyneth, Judi and Tom Wilkinson were the standouts in my opinion.Beautifully written, a well done love story with greatreferences to Shakespeare's other works.  My favorite was when Lord Wessex thought Shakespeare was dead and he came walking at him with his finger pointing at him.  A great reference to the ghost in Hamlet. Go see it.",9,0,1,19 June 1999
L.A. Confidential," Best of 97
","A beautiful film in so many ways, and a huge surprise coming from a Hollywood studio and not being directed by Scorsese or Spielberg.The story is great.  A wonderful distillation of James Ellroy's novel.  It clarifies and simplifies a hugely complex story and still keeps its spirit intact.  It also happens to have the funniest moment in cinema last year. And that moment has historical accuracy.  Take that, Titanic.  Terrific dialogue and an insightful look at issues pertenant today such as tabloid journalism and celebrity worship.The look is dead on and beautiful, costumes lighting etc...  The locations used were great.The acting is wonderful.  Russell Crowe gave my favorite performance of last year.  Kevin Spacey was very close in his finest work yet.  No one else can be complained about.A wonderful throwback to the Hollywood that did things right and it seems to be doing is more consistently.  Primary Colors and The Truman Show being good examples.If you liked it, I would suggest going to your classics sections and picking up The Big Sleep and Touch of Evil.",10,4,7,11 September 1998
The Godfather: Part II," Better than the original
","Possibly the only sequel better than the original.  And one the the greatest 20 movies ever made.A more complex storyline than the original.  The follows the rise of the father and the fall of the son.  Many themes are explored, probably most importantly the dehumanizing effect of greed and lust for power.Beautifully acted all around.A wonderful 200 minutes of cinema.  An A+.",Null,0,0,7 July 1999
Notting Hill," Best of 99 so far
","For those who think film making is about story telling using visuals and not visuals and well if there's a story so be it. Go to this long before the Menace of technology. This is the best straight romantic comedy I have maybe seen this decade.  Well acted all around, wonderful dialogue and other things you can't buy for millions of dollars like charm.Spike is hilarious!!  Hooray for Julia who I have never been a big fan of before.  A",9,0,0,2 June 1999
Armageddon," Godawful, maybe the worst ever
","Possibly the worst movie ever. The worst part about it is that it throws out any of the tenants of story telling.  Movies are a story telling medium using visuals and sound.  Nothing mattered and very little was explained.  I will use only one example but it is really glaring one.  How did they break through those hundreds of feet of rock when they couldn't do anything for hours and suddenly they were almost done?  It was just a bunch of scenes thrown together. Constant mayhem does not substitute for plot and characterization. Next is the horrid editing.  There were so many shots most of the time I could not tell what was going on. The sound was just loud.  I am surprized no one died of an anuerism.Most of the 'acting' was laughable.  Could Liv Tyler have flown any farther over the top.  Could Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis have been any more wooden?The other thing is it wanted to be a 'message movie' about heroism without a hint of subtlety.  I did get a good laugh at how badly this was handled.  And for taking itself seriously the film won't even have any lasting camp value.And don't try to call me a pretentious art film lover.  My favorite films this year were Truman Show, Primary Colors, Out of Sight, Rushmore, A Simple Plan, Saving Private Ryan, Shakespeare in Love, Pleasantville, The Big Lebowski, and A Bugs Life.  All I want is intelligent entertainment.  Not insultingly stupid crap",1,1,3,21 April 1999
American Beauty," Run don't walk
","Run, don't walk to this amazing film.Sam Mendes has an amazing visual sense.  The acting is gorgeous all around.  Spacey comes up with the decades great performance. Wes Bentley is an amazing find.  Chris Cooper, Annette Benning and Thora Birch stellar also.An A+, one of the all time greats. Go today.",10,0,0,26 September 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Great start, horrible end
",This film 1st half is a wonderful use of whimsy.  The love story is enchanting.  Though the dialogue for the first 10 minutes is a little fast and hard to keep up with the subtitles.Then it moves to the concentration camp and the whimsy does not work. Benigni completely romanticizes it.  No one is dirty or overly thin.  And a blurry shot of a pile of bones does not make up for this.This also pushes this modern attitude that we should lie to our children and tell them everything that happens and they do is great.  This is wrong.And Benigni definitely shouldn't have won best actor.  But it is high irony that Tom Hanks finally gave a complex and human portrait of a man and lost to a sentimental performance like he won both of his for.,6,1,3,12 April 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Great Ending for Kubrick
",Another wonderful film to add to Stanley Kubrick's wonderfully diverse list of credits.Tom Cruise and surprisingly Nicole Kidman give excellent performances.Wonderfully original.  The only thing I can think of that has a real similarity is Scorsese's After Hours.  The pacing is measured but I never notice the time once.  It was constantly compelling.  The 40 minutes of the Waterboy I sat through seemed longer.A low A.  See it today,9,0,0,19 July 1999
The Green Mile," Average
",A low B- film that wants you to think it's special.  With it'sepic length and supposedly moving story line.  Decent acting. Hanks back to playing a decent fella instead of a fully realizedcharacter like in Saving Private Ryan.  Barely worth the trip. Way too much on the modern passion play.,7,0,1,11 December 1999
The Waterboy," How does one describe
","How does one describe this kind of awfulness. The joke was on the audience.  Sandler did the same thing over and over and it wasn't funny the first time.  And violence was offered as a solution to stop people from teasing you.  That sounds familiar.I like silly comedies.  The Big Lebowski, Austin Powers and others.  But silly doesn't mean insultingly stupid and annoying. That accent had to go.  I wonder if you people who liked this would find it funny if I came up started talking like an idiot and then hit you if you teased me?  Think about that.  I walked out after 40 minutes of this torture",1,3,6,29 June 1999
Raging Bull," Scorsese Greatest
",The greatest achievement in a career of great achievements by the great modern director Martin Scorsese.A stark portrait of out of control masculinity.  Gorgeously shot in black and white.  Beautifully written.Robert Deniro gives my all time favorite performance.  He never gives a reason to sympathize with Jake but still brings a measure of grace to him.My #3 film of all time.,10,2,2,30 July 1999
Rear Window," One of the Greatest
",My number 7 of all time and Hitchcocks greatest achievement.A wonderful commentary on voyeurism and a terrific thriller.A wonderful ensemble cast.I could gush on for hours.  See it today if you haven't,10,1,3,16 September 1998
The Truman Show," The Best of 98
","The Best Film of 1998.The first thing is that this is a Peter Weir film, not a Jim Carrey film. Though he was great in a breakout role and should have been nominated for the Oscar.  This film is very Hitchkockian.  The feel is one of menace under a thin veil of normalcy.  This is added to by the production design and cinematography.The acting is great.  Ed Harris gives great support to Carrye as the sinister father figure Christof.The script is so subtle it probably feels more clever than it is.It is ultimately a very moving modern fable about a man trying to be his own person when the world is trying to manipulate him into being what they want.In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and good night.",9,0,0,30 March 1999
Jackie Brown," One of the best of 97
","A wonderfully done character study of five people dealing with ageing. The characters are all wonderfully human.  Great acting especially from Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Forster.Tarantino does less stylistic flourishes and comes up with something altogether different than Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  This is a very close adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch.I love how Tarantine sticks with long shots in his films it develops both characters and atmosphere.  All in all an underrated Gem.",9,0,0,11 May 1999
