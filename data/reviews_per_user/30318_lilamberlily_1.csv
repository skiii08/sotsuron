Hereditary," Absolutely terrible. Don't waste your time.
","I'm still amazed at the high reviews about this terribly put together movie. I felt unsatisfied and extremely let down at the end. The entire movie and the concept was explained in 10 minutes and everything in between was pure garbage. It was not original and probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your time, I promise you'll thank me later.",1,3,6,8 September 2018
