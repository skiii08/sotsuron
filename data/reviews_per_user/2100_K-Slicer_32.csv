The Ring," Blank Videotapes Are Spooky...There's A New One
","When I was younger, the spookiest thing that had ever come on a blank videotape was a loud, sustained beep that came on the head cleaner that was used to clean my VCR.  After watching 'The Ring', now I realize that this movie is video tapes what 'Psycho' is taking a shower.  Here are my reasons (some spoilers revealed): (1) Naomi Watts is a very capable actress and she has cemented herself as a suspense queen ('Mulholland Drive' is also recommended). (2) Very solid plotting and very solid writing.  Ehren Kruger is a superior screenwriter and this is the best effort since 'Scream 3'. (3) Brian Cox is one of the best character actors out there currently and he stuns here as well.  (4) David Dorfman had the best performance in the film. He reminded me a lot of Haley Joel Osment in 'The Sixth Sense'. (5) Since when can Gore Verbinski direct a suspense film so well?  I was very surprised to learn that he also directed 'Mouse Hunt'. (6) The mystery of the tape's origin kept me glued to the screen because it was strangely complex. (7) I was still asking questions at the end of it. (8) I found the film to be an odd mix of '8MM' and 'The Mothman Prophecies'. (9) The American version has inspired to check out 'Ringu'. (10) Watching 'The Ring' late at night makes you want to keep the light on as you fall asleep.  Ten reasons give a score of ten.  'The Ring' is definitely a great film if you want a good fright or if you want to waste time.PS:  As I watched this movie, I especially paid attention to Naomi Watts. The way she acted made me wonder if I was watching Nicole Kidman at one point and then Laura Linney the next.  She was a great choice for the film and I hope she chooses more roles to showcase her unique style of acting. Here ends my rant!",10,1,1,21 March 2003
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Brian is blasphemous
","Whether or not someone thinks 'Life Of Brian' is a direct attack on Christ or just a really stupid and/or funny parody, if the Monty Python boys released this back during the Inquisition, they would have been strung up by their toenails and whipped horribly.  Besides that, I think 'Life Of Brian' is more blasphemous than funny.  I got about 2/3 of the way through the film when it started going downhill.  By the end of the film, I was glad it was over.  Jesus Christ is the most revered person in all of human history and it is hard for me to watch a parody of his life.  The men of Monty Python made a somewhat funny film but it wasn't as funny as 'Holy Grail'.  Besides being shocked by the entire film, I also realize there are much worse films out there.  Overall, this is a pretty daring work by the famous comedy troupe as blasphemous as it was despite it not being their intention for the film.  I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,1,9,11 October 2002
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Brian is a small satire with some bite
","It's about time I wrote my defense to what I stated earlier and in here spoilers will be contained.I did watch the opening scene.  I thought it was hilarious and downright funny.  I loved the way the Wise Men mistakenly went to the wrong place. Brian's mother tried to keep the gold with minimal success.  I know that wasn't Jesus lying in that manger, it was Brian.  Throughout the rest of the movie, Brian keeps finding himself intersecting the path of Christ wherever he went.  His story is more of dumb luck/fated consequence unlike Christ's story.Let me make this clear.  This is satire/comedy and I know it is satire/comedy.  For me though and me only, I was horrified by the last third of the film.  I personally hold Jesus Christ on a pedestal like many others do and they do want to see anything bad happen to him.  Imagine someone took a person, object or issue you personally held close to your heart and satirized it.  It could be very hard for you to view.  I love satire on organized religion as much as anybody else but I personally feel that the life and spirit of Christ cannot be contained in someone's interpretation (forming one's own religion based on teachings and life of Christ) so I find the satire hard to watch.  Christ has many, many, many followers and they dearly respect them.  I truly understand why they were up in arms back when 'Life of Brian' was released.I understand satire to be a creative commentary on some particular issue. The user who broke my comments down suggests that I didn't know that this was a satire.  Satire needs a basis and the Four Gospels were the basis for it.  Like I said earlier, it is hard for me to deal with that (I guess I am opening myself for being targeted, so fire away!).  On other subjects, I don't mind satire but when it comes to Christ's life as the basis and even though he is not the central character, I find it hard to swallow.One more thing, I never suggested that we return to the Inquisition.  I would want to strangle myself I ever suggested that.  My point was along the lines of banned work.  Works like 'The Divine Comedy' were banned because they suggested things that went against the Catholic Church and 'Life of Brian' is a direct challenge (whether they meant it to be or not:  I am thinking not!) to the authority at that time if it had been released at that time.  Since 'The Church' was in charge at the time, they did not have a sense of humor and people were savagely tortured to the point of death (the boys of Monty Python could have suffered like that).  I am suggesting that the world in our own time is more accepting of to the thoughts and words of satirists and comedians than ever before.  The Inquisition was retributive in ways I cannot fathom.  The methods they used that I can fathom make me want to die.  I would bury myself in a garden plot with a funnel over my mouth to breathe as just a small punishment for suggesting 'a return to the 'good ol' days of the inquisition'.  The Inquisition was as bad as those suffered under the likes of Amin, Pinochet, Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler (insert others here if you can think of any).  May The Inquisition Forever Stay Dead!!!So, in conclusion, I find 'Life of Brian' to be a funny movie for the first 2/3 and it heads steadily south by the end on my above reasoning.  I think the boys of Monty Python have created a comedy/satire that will forever stand the test of time.  Many, many, many movie lovers love this movie. I think it is a great comedy myself in several ways (jokes, writing, direction, acting are well-done).  As a movie, it entertains but as a satire it fails.  I give this movie 8 out of 10!PS:  Jesus Christ has whethered satire before and people have cheapened the Crucifixion and Resurrection in ways I cannot imagine and those cheapenings have been much worse.  All in all, 'Life is Brian' is somewhat small in the scheme of things.Here ends my rant!",8,0,3,12 December 2002
Se7en," One of the best horror/mystery film ever made
","This is a film that will scare you and will be in the back of your mind forever.  I loved this movie for it's creepy effect.  It is in the vain of such mentally challenging and scary features as Angel Heart and The Changeling.  What really makes this film is it's use of a mystifying story line.  Even though the killer is eventually found, the mystery doesn't stop there.  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and R. Lee Ermey among others round out a very good line-up.  Pitt is good as the foul-mouthed young detective Mills. Freeman is awesome as the aging and wisdom-filled detective Somerset.  The choice of villain is an especially nice touch but telling would break a great story.  Overall, David Fincher exceeded all expectations for this film and that is possibly the main reason it is a classic.10 out of 10.  Try to watch this movie with the lights out.",10,0,0,19 November 2001
Akira," My all-time favorite anime
","'Akira' is one of the most visually potent animated films of all time.  Set in a darkly futuristic version of modern-day Tokyo, this tale tells of several people trying to stop mentally unbalanced adolescent from turning the city into rubble by the use of enhanced mental abilities.  I have seen this movie twice and I still cannot believe how spooky and disturbing it is. The plot is hard enough to follow that it might require a second viewing. This is a movie to watch if you really to have some fun experiencing the anime genre.The animation is exceptional considering it came out before the advent of computer-assisted animation.  Now, it looks even better since it is digitally remastered.  I believe this is the best animated work to have come out of the Land of the Rising Sun.  It is quiet possibly the most beautiful classically (aka sans computer assistance) animated film of all time even though it was probably one of the last ones to ever be made in the classic sense.  Overall, Katsuhiro Otomo has created visual and even psychological potpourri that will leave an etch on the psyche of animation for all time despite the country of origin.  Animated films that were released after 'Akira' and that have yet to be released have looked and will continue to look 'Akira' for inspiration because of how groundbreaking it actually was.  This movie introduced me to the anime genre but nothing will probably overtake 'Akira' as being my all-time favorite anime film.  10 out of 10!",10,4,7,6 April 2002
Memento," Can you say Oscar Nominations?
","This is a stunning piece of cinema with bits of humor and lots of suspense and drama.  Guy Pearce was at his best in the role as a man who suffers from short-term amnesia.  Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Palantonio had great supporting performances since The Matrix.  This is the best suspense movie that I have seen since L.A. Confidential.  I think Christopher Nolan deserves a Best Director Oscar nod for his excellent direction of this film. Guy Pearce deserves a Best Actor nod for his performance.  Memento also contains some of the best film editing I have seen in years.  I think this movie will probably end up getting at least three to ten Oscar nominations. If not, the Academy doesn't know great filmmaking when they see it.  This is one of the best films of 2000-2001.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,2,4 September 2001
12 Angry Men," Always watch the classics!
","I haven't seen too many classics in my time and I am particularly fond of this one. When it comes to the justice system and political jousting, this is probably the best movie ever made. Jury deliberations are always held out of public view and it was interesting to see how they could possibly go. Granted that this movie is a work of fiction, I found it to be one of the most realistic films of all time as well.  This is a dramatic legal classic and I can see where Scott Turow and John Grisham got some inspiration for their respective career choices maybe.Here are my reasons (some spoilers may be revealed): (1) The performance of Henry Fonda anchored this rather extraordinary piece of celluloid. It was one of the first film roles that really preached political correctness and it was done with both levelheadedness and style. At the time, Fonda took on the underdog character in a completely new and different way and that made it the best performance in the movie. (2) This was a movie filled with a lot of excellent performances and the next best one goes to E. G. Marshall.  To me, he was the actual conservative of the movie (sorry Mr. Cobb).  His views were exactly opposite of Fonda but he kept a sound mind. He logically challenged Fonda at every turn but he never lost his cool.  While Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb played the 'conservative' roles (more like fascist bigots in my opinion), Marshall kept his emotions in check and kept with the cold logic (much like Fonda) and that is why I found his performance to fit the bill of true conservative. (3) Another great performance was done by Joseph Sweeney. He proved that old men know their stuff. He reminded me of my maternal grandfather who is a very learned and observant man himself. Sweeney definitely stole a few scenes from both Fonda and Marshall. He definitely should have been nominated for a supporting actor Oscar. (4) Keeping with the same logic, I really liked George Voskovec. He provided the outside perspective in the movie. The tense scene he had with Jack Warden was the most emotional moment in the film next to Lee J. Cobb's breakdown before the end of the film. Granted the nationality of his character was unknown, it goes to show that people of all ethnicities share the liberal views on very tenuous issues. (5) The fifth best performance goes to the man who played Quincy for seven seasons on the show of the same name. What made him stand out was the fact that he didn't vote not guilty right away even though he was a slum survivor like the defendant in the murder trial. That is a point that those of the same background will always feel sorry for one another. That role was put into the movie to reinforce the sense of reality that the movie was trying to portray. (6) Even though I haven't seen a lot of his films, I found Sidney Lumet's direction of '12 Angry Men' to be Oscar worthy. He definitely cared about this movie and it was maybe the best film he ever had the chance to helm. (7) This movie was spectacularly well-written. Some of the scenarios couldn't have come about without a great writer to do it. Reginald Rose did a great job in coming up with an excellent screenplay and an excellent set of circumstances to play around with. His talent is evident with the fact that the old man pointed out the last fact and the leader of the non-guilty side didn't. (8) The cinematography made me feel the heated claustrophobia that the jurors were suffering through. Throw in a few lighting switches and a small change in dramatic effects and you have an emotionally-charged picture. I was really intrigued by the close-ups on some of the actors. You could really sense the raw emotion all those men felt as they debated away on such a weighty decision. It was beyond words at some moments. (9) This truly was a summer movie. The heat coming into a confined space and the rain coming down at night signaled this thought. I am not a big fan of typical popcorn films and I believe this a needed reprieve from that. I watched this film during a summer thunderstorm and I had to smile at the poetry behind it. It will make anyone blink a couple of times. (10) Not only is this a summer film, it is a time capsule film. Nowadays, no one could get away with making a film about a jury filled with only white men. Men and women from all standings would have to be thrown into the mix to satiate the public and the hounds of political correctness (aka most of Hollywood anyway). I wasn't offended by this movie at all even though it lacked politcal correctness in terms of the times we currently live on. At that time, it was legally acceptable to do as such and the times eventually change. This film captures the late fifties' mentality on the legal system, political correctness, and class struggle perfectly. Ten reasons give this movie a score of ten.Overall, I found '12 Angry Men' to be a classic that everyone from all walks of life should watch. Not only does hit hard on the times in which it took place, it makes a lot of good points on the unfairness of the legal system and fallability of mankind. All sorts of political opinions and logical paths were followed but it was easy to understand and it made '12 Angry Men' all the better. It should not be missed!

Happy Gilmore," The Gentlemen's Sport Meets Adam Sandler
","'Happy Gilmore' is on of the funniest movies of all time.  I don't see how anyone couldn't laugh at this movie.  Where else can you see Adam Sandler get into a fight with Bob Barker?  Although the plot is lacking any sort of major depth, the comedic writing is well-crafted and well-edited.  Adam Sandler is one of the most-talented comedic actors on the planet whether or not the movies he star in are good or bad.  Underrated by critics but loved by fans everywhere, it gets a 9 out of 10!PS:  This was his best movie before 'Mr. Deeds' and the best golf comedy after 'Caddyshack'!",9,1,1,12 October 2002
The Others," Excellent Horror
","The best psychological horror that lives up to 'The Sixth Sense' is the 'The Others'.  'The Others' is a true suspense film in every sense of the phrase. Here are the reasons (spoilers contained within): (1) Nicole Kidman is one of the best screen actresses I have ever seen.  Her mentally exasperating and nail-biting performance is the best of her career. (2) Alejandro Amenabar is one of the most creative filmmakers out there right now.  He presides over this movie with a hand of a creative master. (3) Amenabar's writing skills are excellent as well.  Every scene that he wrote give a sense of the mental dread that the family feels as they progress toward the climax and conclusion. (4) The musical score also enhances the dread. Amenabar is also a musical jack. (5) I love the metaphor of light in a mansion as a water on a sinking ship. (6) The cinematography and lighting leaves no wanting. (7) The events of the story are spooky enough. (8) The last twenty minutes of the film are worth the ticket price alone. (9) The rest of the cast put in excellent performances as well. (10) Truly classic horror methods were used to convey mental dread.  Ten reasons give a score of ten.  Overall, this is a truly spooky film and it should have received an Oscar for either acting, directing, screen writing or even musical score.PS: Also see 'Abre los Ojos' and 'Vanilla Sky' to see Alejandro Amenabar's creative genius at work.  He along with Tom Tykwer are part of a new wave of filmmakers from Europe that have invaded the United States and brought some clarity and sanity to the supposed normalcy in American cinema.  Let the good work keep coming!  Here ends my rant!",10,3,3,21 March 2003
Dead Poets Society," May Dead Poets Live On!
","When 'The Simpsons' comments on this movie destroying the profession of education, it made me want to watch it.  This movie is good for ten reasons...1) Peter Weir directs with a haunting hand and certain scenes show it very well. 2) Robin Williams blew me away as John Keating.  It made me wonder why he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor. 3) The story and plotting were exceptional.  I didn't expect the suicide scene near the conclusion. 4) Ethan Hawke showed his early star power here as the silent student who wants to be a poet. 5) Robert Sean Leonard pulled in an excellent performance as the student wanting to do things his way. 6) All the supporting performances were well-done and not overacted. 7) The cinematography was crisp and clear.  The scene with the bike going down the hill is the best example I can offer there. 8) This was a movie about a teacher inspiring students and I have a soft spot for films like this. 9) There is a good warning in film about actions having unexpected and very unintentional consequences. 10) The last five minutes are unbelieveable.  If I were in a theater, I would have given a standing ovation.With those reasons, this film gets 10 out of 10!  'The Dead Poets Society' rules and may it live on.  Here ends my rant!",10,3,5,15 February 2003
L.A. Confidential," The Best Movie Ever Made
",LA Confidential is the Best Movie Ever Made.  I think it was robbed of Best Picture of 1997 at the Oscars.  Kim Basinger had the best performance in the entire movie as a seemingly cold-hearted prostitute who realizes the mistakes and is sorry later. She is my favorite actress and this is best performance to date.  The plot is really hard to understand at first but it is easier to understand with a second viewing.  This movie showed me that problems like drug dealing and corruption were relevant back then as they are now.  Curtis Hanson took a difficult to adapt novel and made a very edgy and twisted mystery thriller.  The cast is one of the most memorable in movie history.  The crew did a very good job in making a back lot studio look like LA in the 1950's.  LA Confidential is my personal favorite and one of the best movies ever.  I give it a 10!,10,0,1,19 March 2001
We Were Soldiers," The best war film in the past few years
","This is best film on the Vietnam War that I have ever seen. Mel Gibson does extremely well as a commanding officer and father of five seeing the omens stack up one by one.  With support from war movie vet Sam Elliot, they put on two of the best performances in this film.  I liked Sam Elliot's dead-on and somewhat hilarious retorts to the other cast members.  Chris Klein, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper, Madeline Stowe, and Keri Russell rounded out a great cast that were all affected by the first major skirmish of the Vietnam War. What made this movie especially good and at some points hard to watch was the method of chosen storytelling.  The story wasn't limited to the American combatants.  It told the story from the Vietnamese point of view of the North Vietnamese army as well as the wives of the American troops.  This was another film to show that war is hell for every side.  It is reminiscent of 'Braveheart', 'The Patriot', 'Saving Private Ryan', and 'Enemy At The Gates'.  The cinematography, choreographed violence, and make-up effects made this biopic of the 7th Cavalry Division all the more unsettling and effective.  Randall Wallace made a film that should always be looked at as one of the most patriotic films of all time.  This is the best war film to have come out since 'Saving Private Ryan' and I give it a 10 out of 10!",10,8,14,31 August 2002
Notting Hill," Even the Little Folk Have A Chance
","I watched this movie at first to see Julia Roberts and then I realized that Hugh Grant was an actor who had talent too.  Casting them together was a stroke of genius and giving them a tightly written script that bites the hand that feeds it gives the awesome film 'Notting Hill' (spoilers contained herein).  Here are the reasons: (1) Julia Roberts gives her best post-'My Best Friend's Wedding' performance and (2) Hugh Grant gives his best pre-'About A Boy' performance. (3) Rhys Ifans was hilarious as the Hugh Grant's roommate. (4) The best scenes had Hugh Grant pretending to be a reporter from a well-known British magazine. (5) The script was unbelieveably well-written. (6) The 'walking down the street' scene was great statement about how as time moves on, everything changes either for the better or worse. (7) Several lines are definitely quoteworthy. (8) The jabs that Hollywood sustained came in the form of creative dialogue. (9) The onscreen romance between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant was great in it's own right. (10) I like the idea of a common man falling in love with a movie starlet and she fell in love with him too.  Ten reasons give a score of 10!Combining two great talents with a few nice whacks at the hand that feeds them works nicely for me.  It is too bad that the combination of two or even three great performers usually sometimes leaves a bad stench behind but that is sometimes the way the cards fall.  Overall, 'Notting Hill' is noteworthy, quoteworthy and definitely a good dramedy.  Here ends my rant!",10,0,1,9 March 2003
American Psycho," Why??? Why did I see this movie???
","As much as any movie lover out there, I don't mind certain levels of gratuitous violence.  'American Psycho' though took to a level that it shouldn't have been taken too.  (spoiler here) The scene with the homeless man and the two prostitutes was not needed.  After the prostitute scene, I had to shut it off.  Besides the violence, the shallowness and vileness of Bale's Patrick Bateman made my skin crawl.  He is a nut job of the highest order and he needed to be taken out.  The only decent scene in this very horrible glimpse into the mind of a yuppie whose gone over the cuckoo's nest was nothing at all.  The dialogue in the film was sharp and the performances of Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, and Jared Leto were all right but that was it.  The other characters were annoying, shallow, and inept and the setting was too much in the 1980's (very off-putting).  Overall, 'American Psycho' is a film that no one should see under any circumstances.  I give it 1 out of 10.",1,7,21,11 October 2002
American Beauty," The Best Film of 1999
","How can you call this movie a dark comedy?  It was dark but it wasn't funny. This is a great stab at suburban society in the USA.  It shows that every place in America has problems and the burbs are not as clean-cut as they appear to be.  Kevin Spacey steals this movie away from everybody else. Chris Cooper, Annette Benning, Wes Bentley, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, and Peter Galegher round out probably one of the best casts in one of the best movies of all time.  When I first saw this movie, I was stunned.  This film cemented the fact that their are problems with everybody everywhere even though it was set in suburbia.  The issues dealt with in this movie are pretty sick but it had to be done.  I loved this film and it is one my ten personal favorites.10 out of 10.  This is a freaky film.  Everybody in the burbs should view it.",10,0,0,31 October 2001
28 Days Later...," Could have been worse...
","I saw this movie because I had a feeling that it will slip under the radar and become of a 'UHF' for the year 2k3.  Understandably, this film may be one of the best films in what seems like, at least in my mind, another summer filled with nothing but more sequels and lame remakes.  After I watched it, I came away with a deep sense of satisfaction knowing that my money and time were well spent.Here are my reasons (spoilers contained): (1) This was a horror movie. There was enough gore and psychosis to go around and the balance between them was perfectly leveled. (2) The cinematography was dark and gritty.  I felt like I was watching 'Trainspotting' again. (3) Even in a movie supposedly devoid of any real subject matter, there was a bit of thought injected into it.  I especially liked the ranting of the sergeant who was chained to the radiator. (4) Maybe I don't have a sense for knowing whether a film is predictable or not, I found it to be slightly unpredictable and that was good enough for me.  The last five minutes of the film is probably the best example I can cite on this point. (5) Danny Boyle knows how to work with a camera and a cast.  His exemplary direction of '28 Days Later...' gives weight to the notion that he one of the better directors currently in the industry. (6) Although nowhere near as compelling as 'In The Company of Men', I was intrigued by the fact that humans are cruel to fellow humans when infected or not infected with contagious plague.  The one sets of scenes where Jim is talking with Selina and Mark in Jim's home, we find that Mark horribly describes his escape from infestation as people (infected or otherwise) try to escape those in the crowd who are miasmic. (7) Realism plays a key role in '28 Days Later...'.  In a situation like that, you will never know who you will run into and who you will end up trusting, distrusting, or mistrusting.  I think if I were put into a situation like that, I might end up with only my brother, my third cousin once-removed, and my mortal enemy as my only companions.  I found the film to be a realistic portrayal of fictional circumstances. (8) I thought the best performance of the film went to Jim.  The man was a masterful lead as distraught bike courier and andrenaline-charged savior. (9) This was definitely a retreat from typical summer fare.  I think this might be the best film of the summer.  Nine reasons give a score of nine.My only beef was with the male nudity.  Too much can make anyone go blind but I guess it was deserved.  How many horror movies have been made with naked females?  It was definitely a retreat from the typical horror junk (like Jeepers Creepers III: He Comes Back for a cheeseburger and Jason XXV: Jason Dies From A Kick In The Shin by a 7-year old girl).  Overall, I found this movie to be worth the time and money so skip 'The Hulk', 'Charlie's Angels', and whatever other big name stuff that is coming out and go see something that will disappear fast.  That is why I saw '28 Days Later...' now because it may be gone next weekend.Here ends my rant!",9,0,1,28 June 2003
The Graduate," The worst 'classic' of all time
","I watched this film and I wondered how.  HOW!  How could 'The Graduate' be a classic?  This movie is a really dumb and utterly depressing piece of work. I decided to vote for this movie on the number of actual qualities it possessed.  The movie is deeming qualities of this film are the awesome performances of Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross and the incredible score by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkle.  Besides that, 'The Graduate' is not a classic.  It royally sucks and I can't believe this movie reached the heights that it has.This is where I rant for several hundred words.  The real reason this movie bites is because of Dustin Hoffman's character.  He is a stalker and there is nothing beyond that.  I have no sympathy for him.  He is a brainless moron who needs to be beat with a chunk of cinder block.  He uses his second head as opposed to his first and that is really a stupid thing to do.  By doing that, he screws himself over as well as the woman he loves and her father too.  It is extremely sickening to see this.Another aspect was Mrs. Robinson herself.  She is evil and willing to cheat upon her own husband with a younger man.  She also blames the young man for the problems she has caused.  In my mind, adultery is repulsive and since she doesn't want to take responsibility for her own actions, it is even more repulsive.Thirdly, innocent people are hurt because the actions of the two aforementioned.  Katharine Ross' character is unfairly hurt.  She is dragged across hot coals in this.  In reality, she would have dumped the brainless moron and found someone else who actually cared for her. The scenes she played out with Dustin Hoffman were really eerie.  Realistically, she would have called the police and they would have dragged him away.Fourthly, the dichotomy of reality and unreality in 'The Graduate' is really messed up.  At first, the story has an extremely realistic edge to it but the last third ends up unrealistic.  I was hoping that Hoffman's character would have been the loser but it doesn't happen.  The object of affection in the film finds it cute that her cracked in the head suitor is chasing after her.  She is an absolutely rational adult and she should comprehend that she isn't a teenager and what this man is doing isn't cute.  It is really deranged and beyond the norm.Overall, this is a sad excuse for a film.  It should never have reached the level that it has.  It is overrated, sickening, and above all wrong.  I despise adultery and I sometimes despise the fact that emotion overrules logic.  'The Graduate' give sympathy to a main character who doesn't honestly deserve it.  I wish the guy would have picked up his shattered heart and moved on with life but it didn't play out that way.  I give this sad film a 2 out of 10!  Thanks goodness for the sane music!Here ends my rant!",2,23,45,9 November 2002
Saw," I 'saw' this movie and it was demented
","'Saw' is a film that be revered as one of the better serial killer-slash-mindscrew films of this decade. While 'Saw' obviously suffers from a lack of logic and experience, it's hard not to give James Wan and Leigh Whannell pats on the back for making such a twisted, bankable flick. I was left chilled to the bone by the ways that the Jigsaw Killer operated. I have to say my favorite torture game was the one with the safe, candle and the red numbers on the wall. For me, it appeared that these guys must have studied their inspirations in order to make a film that would leave you saying 'That was a scary movie'.There were three areas of success in 'Saw'. The gritty, demented and all-out distressing setting for the core scenes of the film is the first success. Elwes and Whannell's characters both agreed they were caught in a really crappy situation and the rotten restroom helped fuel that idea. I don't think there was any other possible setting that could have been used to play the game where those two were the victims. The second success was the pacing of the film. It was slow at first but it was accelerated up toward the climax. It set the perfect mood up for the lesser astute viewers to be enthralled by the inevitable twist at the end. The third success was the twist. The twist is one of the best realized moments in recent cinema history. I must say the killer was the last one I ever expected. Even if anybody expected anything about the third person in the bathroom, I don't think anybody could have possibly known whom it was. Those three things make this movie a worthwhile viewing pleasure.Like any movie, there are a few off-putting things about it. The violence is sadistic and killer is deranged; this is a movie for those with strong stomachs. Cary Elwes did a 180 on me (going from killer in one movie to victim in this film) but his performance was scary to say the least. He may be the most unintentionally annoying on Earth. I think his heart was in this film but his acting style is a taste that many will never acquire. He failed in 'Saw'. Speaking of Elwes, the acting for this movie was all over the place and I blame the inexperience of the filmmakers. They were out to make an entertaining film and acting was probably second to plot, mood, and theme. There are also too many parallels to Seven and Silence of the Lambs in 'Saw'. I did not really this movie as an homage to them as much as I 'saw' it as an almost-intentional rip-off of both films.Overall, 'Saw' is a better written and better made serial killer-slash-mindscrew film. It isn't as good as 'Seven' or 'Silence...' but it's far better than the likes 'Twisted', 'Taking Lives' and 'Gothika'. While these boy wonders have made an imperfect debut film, I see them becoming better with time. For what it is, it is dark, demented, moody, fearful, and above all impressive. In the great realm of cinema, expect this to be lodged under cult classic. 'Saw' deserves a score of eight.",8,0,0,19 February 2005
Pulp Fiction," Fiction was never this good
","One of the first movie trailers I ever remember really liking.  Thanks to that trailer and the pulse-pounding guitar riffs of the chosen song, I was immediately taken in.  I first saw this film four years after it's initial release and it still stays with me every time.  This movie isn't 'Resevoir Dogs' but it's a classic nonetheless.'Pulp Fiction' easily has ten things going for it (spoilers contained herein): (1) The dialogue is quotable and I still hear quotes from it. (2) The scene with the adrenaline shot is one that should never be duplicated. (3) Samuel L. Jackson rocked this movie.  This was the best performance of his career. (4) Harvey Keitel was best supporting performer.  He was the comic relief and he did very well at it. (5) Quentin Tarantino is a master writer and master director. (6) The interweaving and rather disturbing tales are told surprisingly well. (7) The film editing was unreal.  I think Memento took some ideas from this movie. (8) The imagery dealing with God and spirituality made me wonder for a good long time. (9) Several rather unknown people show up and make for some memorable performances (Burr Steers and Phil LaMarr were in the first third). (10) The movie had a certain cheese factor that made it all the better.  Ten reasons give a score of 10.Cheesy and well-written are clearly two contradictory elements and that is especially true in the medium of film.  Quentin Tarantino proved the world wrong with the release of this movie.  It really rules!  Here ends my rant!",10,1,2,7 March 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Six reasons as opposed to three
","I have six reasons now that I like this movie as opposed to three (spoilers contained within).The good reasons are... 1) Chris Columbus did a rather exceptional job of directing. 2) The art direction reminds me of 'Brazil' and 'Minority Report'. 3) Daniel Radcliffe makes a great Harry Potter. 4) Many of England's A-List came out to play (Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris {he will be missed}, Alan Rickman, John Cleese, and Maggie Smith all did well in their respective roles). 5) The Quidditch Match was the best scene in the film. 6) The special effects are eye candy.The bad reasons are... 1) The book will always have the upper hand. 2) The film was dry and drawn out. 3) The plotting suffered because of the marketing. 4) It was too simplistic as well because of the marketing.Overall, it is much better than I made it out to be.  I had to read the book to truly appreciate it but the book will always be better than the film in my mind.  There are twice as many reasons that I like this film than before so I give this film twice the score.  It gets 6 out of 10!Here ends my rant!",3,0,1,4 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Horribly Overrated
","I can't believe I saw this film.  I thought it was overrated and way too long.  It was also very, very boring.  I don't know how someone could like this story.  I guess it was never meant for those who are into movies about 12-year olds who have magical powers.  Too bad those powers couldn't save this movie from being horrible.  I don't know how this film could have pulled in as much money and critical acclaim as it did.  Maybe it was witchcraft then but it didn't get me to waste my money on going to see it at the theater or rent it on video.  If this movie reaches classic status like 'Titanic' or 'The Graduate', I will be extremely horrified.  I give this movie 3 out of 10.",3,0,1,14 October 2002
Enemy at the Gates," A rare breed of war film
",It isn't often you see a war film made by an American film company that where Americans are not a present force.  This movie dealt only with the Soviets and Germans at Stalingrad.  I liked the idea of two snipers duking it out with each other with long-range rifles.  Jude Law had his best performance since he was in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' as the Russian protagonist.  Ed Harris was great as the German antagonist.  Bob Hoskins was a surprise as the burly Nikita Khruschev.  This to me is the WWII movie for the Soviets what 'Saving Private Ryan' is to the Americans.  This is my all-time favorite war movie.  I give it a 10.,10,1,3,28 September 2001
A Beautiful Mind," I need to retool my Top 10 list
","After some serious consideration on my part, I have decided to retool my Top Ten List and it will take time to come up with a final list.  A 'Beautiful Mind' I believe now was the best film of the year it was released (think Space Odyssey score here).  I really liked this movie.  How often does one see a film about mathematician who is schizophrenic? Here are my reasons for liking 'A Beautiful Mind': (1) Russell Crowe is a multi-dimensional actor and this is by far the best performance of his careeer.  He should have won the Oscar. (2) Jennifer Connelly showed some major chops as Crowe's wife.  Her Oscar was well-deserved.  (3) Ron Howard finally got his Oscar.  His direction of films has only gotten better over the years (last best example is Apollo 13). (4) You go into this film thinking you know what will happen but you aren't really prepared for it. (5) The writing and plotting were fantastic. (6) The action sequences weren't typical Hollywood cheese. (7) The make-up effects were entirely realistic.  Crowe and Connelly looked completely different and they didn't look overdone. (8) The two intellectual geeks from 'Dazed and Confused' showed up as Crowe's friends and they weren't at all annoying. (9) The conclusion of the film nearly caused me to break down into tears. (10) THe middle third is unbelievable too.  Ten reasons give a score of 10!I think I have possibly found my all-time favorite film.  I think I should also readjust my favorite actors and actresses lists too.  Here ends my rant!",10,0,2,7 March 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The lamest movie so far this year!
","Unlike the first film, I saw this movie in the theatre and I wanted my seven dollars back at the end.  I haven't read the books so I really can't say that the movies are lame because of it.  I found the movies lame because it was too neatly pressed and cleaned up for this sort of  film regardless that they were based on previously written material.  According to what I have heard, the books are loaded with great dialogue and sarcastic and witty commentary.  Both films were devoid of those aspects.  Some found the films funny and I didn't find them such.  The plot could have been written too fit an hour and a half as opposed to one and a half days.  The subject of witchcraft is not one that entices me either.  The few redeeming qualities of this movie are the performance of Jason Isaacs and the darkness and dankness of the Hogwarts setting (the art direction was brilliant). Overall, this is the longest and lamest film of 2002.  I give this dumb film 3 out of 10!Here ends my rant!",3,3,5,16 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," I recant...it was worth the seven bucks
","Unlike my earlier comments, the second installment of Harry Potter is surprisingly decent.  Consider each reason that I type here is worth a dollar. (1) The adapted screenplay of Steven Kloves.  The adaptation stayed faithful to JK Rowling's novel. (2) The rather skin-crawling performance of Jason Isaacs.  I think this was his best role since 'The Patriot' and the best supporting role in the film. (3) The film had excellent plotting.  I was in awe at several unexpected twists the film took. (4) England's A-List reappeared again.  Kenneth Branagh did really well as the self-centered Gilderoy Lockhart. (5) The art direction is still some of the best out there. (6) Daniel Radcliffe will be forever remembered as Harry Potter. (7) The special effects are noteworthy again.The downsides are...(1) the length, (2) the marketing to those younger than myself, (3) the book will always have the upper hand.Seven reasons make this movie worth the seven dollars.  Here ends my rant!",3,1,2,12 February 2003
Rosemary's Baby," The creepiest antithesis ever made
","I have only seen two Roman Polanski films in my time and this is by far is his best effort (the other being 'The Ninth Gate' which was also well-done). Polanski did justice to Ira Levin's seminal antithesis to the first few chapters of the Gospel of Luke.  The name of the book and movie are just astounding itself.  Mia Farrow was well cast as the paranoid and protective Rosemary.  Ruth Gordon was excellent as the sugar-coated, sour-centered next door neighbor.  The story was provocative, spooky, and it got under my skin. It ranks in my 'skin-crawling' movie list.  Overall, this is a well-made creepshow that will probably make any man want to pick up a Bible and read it from cover to cover.  10 out of 10.",10,1,2,16 December 2001
Vanilla Sky," The best film of 2001
","This is a movie that will make you feel brain-fried after one viewing of it. I think this is the best film that Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe have both made.  The movie contains excellent dialogue, ravishing cinematography, subtle comedy, and a great deal of intellectual ideas on dreams.  'Vanilla Sky' reminds a little of the lesser known 'The Thirteenth Floor' in the idea of distinguishing what is real and was it unreal.  Cameron Crowe took a chance on directing a movie that crosses several different genres and it has paid off.  Tom Cruise is excellent as the facially-deformed David Aames. Kurt Russell did well as Dave's psychoanalyst.  Jason Lee made a surprising performance as Dave's best friend.  The best performance in the entire movie IMHO is Penelope Cruz as Sofia (she did well in certain serious and certain funny moments).  Cameron Diaz was great as the sweet-covered but sour-centered Julie.  Overall, this is one of the best multi-genre movies ever made and one of my all-time favorites.10 out of 10.  This is best film of 2001.",10,1,2,27 December 2001
Space Jam," A Popcorn Flick...nothing more
","I first saw this film upon release back seven years ago. It was good for a popcorn flick but not if you were looking for something with a little more psychological bite (like Fargo, released in the same year). Here are my reasons (spoilers herein): (1) I love the Looney Tunes and I will always be a fan of them no matter how inept and lame the next movie they make is. (2) Michael Jordan's performance is OK for a first attempt. (3) The special effects are well-done. (4) The entire sequence where the players try to figure out how they lost their talent almost had me on the floor laughing. (5) Charles Barkley uttered the line 'I'll never go out with Madonna again' while praying to God is the single best adult-oriented line in the movie. (6) They couldn't resist taking a shot at Disney as well. (7) The best performance in the movie goes to Bill Murray.  He is relentless when he is on screen and it pays off.  Murray's cameo is one of his better roles pre-Rushmore and one of the best cameos of all time.  Seven reasons give a score of seven.As for the downsides: (1) Not much was given to plot development but there wasn't much to begin with in the first place. (2) Creepiest performance goes to Wayne Knight as Stan.  He was like Wormtail in the Harry Potter series. (3) Those little aliens are really annoying and whiny.  I prefer the villains to have a bit of a backbone even if they are puny.Overall, 'Space Jam' is just another popcorn flick that is perfect to kill a weekend afternoon with.  Michael Jordan should stick to his day job which isn't ironically playing basketball anymore.  As for mixing cartoon characters and real-life characters into movies, thankfully these films are few and far between.  I suggest other titles like 'Rushmore' and 'Fargo' among others and this should be picked out as a last resort.Here ends my rant!",7,5,8,13 July 2003
Amélie," Great Love Story in every sense of the word
","I really liked this movie.  I think this is the best film from France that I have seen since 'The Bridge' and 'Ridicule'.  The characters and story were complex, offbeat, and quirky.  Audrey Tautou did exceptionally well as the very introverted but very willing do-gooder Amelie.  She had a lot of love for her fellow human beings and in the process she falls in love with a fellow introvert and quirky photo collector named Nino.  It is a great love story in every sense of the word.  I wish Audrey Tautou could have been nominated for an Oscar but the film was nominated five times over, so it wasn't a total downer. Overall, 'Amelie' rocks!  I give this film a 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,9 September 2002
Final Destination," I recant what I said earlier (SPOILERS!)
","Final Destination sucks pure and simple.  It is one of the worst horror movies of all time.  It's not a guilty pleasure and it isn't a horror film. It's insulting to sit there and watch a bunch of teens who are trying to outrun the angel of death even though they will die eventually.  The fact that Alex saw 'Death's plan' meant he wasn't supposed to die on that plane and those students who listened to him weren't supposed to die there either. Those who lived were meant to die at those points in the movie.  The teacher was supposed to die in her house.  The ditzy, fraidy blonde was supposed to get KO'ed by the bus.  I think making a movie were someone is trying to outrun death when it is going to catch up with him or her eventually is truly sardonic.  Maybe, that's the point of the film.  Either way, it sucks!2 out of 10.  Hey, at least it isn't as bad as Valentine, Tomcats, or Freddy Got Fingered.",2,5,11,12 December 2001
Final Destination," This movie is overrated
","This movie was not worth it's praise.  I thought it would be good but I was a little too hopeful.  I thought the death scenes were way overdone. If the teacher was going to be killed, could it have been quicker?  The performances of Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were great as well as the rest of the cast.  I thought it was better than some of the horror movies I have seen including Idle Hands etc but it was not as good as the Scream trilogy.5 out of 10.  It could have been better.",2,3,7,7 May 2001
Donnie Darko," Why can't indy films come here?
","I live in an area where you have to drive at least 100 miles to see a film that isn't mass-marketed.  I think that truly sucks.  Oh well, I guess that why someone invented the VCR and someone capitalized on the idea of renting out movies.  I believe those ideas came into effect in the 1980's.That is where the film is 'Donnie Darko' begins.  Set in 1988, this films takes through a segment of the life of a mentally warped teen named Donnie Darko.  For some strange reason, he starts seeing this rabbit that makes the little bunny from 'Monty Python and The Holy Grail' look docile.  From there, Donnie takes a mysterious trip that eventually culminates in a conclusion that is left open for one to decide what it means. 
What really grabbed me was the plot and story of the film.  It is a very intricate puzzle that will mess your mind up after you watch it.  Richard Kelly wrote and directed a beautiful mental puzzler that will leave you asking many questions.  Jake Gyllenhall did extremely well as Donnie.  He probably had one of the best performances in the year 2001.  I was stunned how well he could go from straight-faced to psycho in point three seconds. Drew Barrymore, Jena Malone, Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze did well in rounding out a perfect cast.  The special effects weren't in your face and the ending seems correct depending upon what point of view you take.In the end, 'Donnie Darko' is my type of film.  I love puzzling plots and deep themes.  If that is your type of film, buy or rent it on DVD. 10 out of 10!I also recommend:  Fight Club, Dark City, Memento, Jin Roh, Ghost In The Shell, Akira, Vanilla Sky, Ghost Dog:  Way Of The Samurai, The Ninth Gate, Rosemary's Baby, Reservoir Dogs, and Zero Effect",10,0,0,14 April 2002
