Angels & Demons," One of the worst addaptations I have ever watched
","Please don't watch this (this is a post morten advice because I'm marking this that contains spoilers, so you would have most likely watched it). Read the book instead. Things that I didn't like about this move
-There are some missing characters that I think are crucial for the developing of the events. Kohler is one the first characters introduced and is the one who discovers Vetra's bodys.
-Vetra (Vittoria's father) is also missing. And let me say that he is a more important character for the story becuase (1) He, being Vittoria father, explain a lot of her behaivour (2) The fact that only he and his daugther know about the antimatter will provide a plot twist at the end of the novel. (3) He being a cathlic father trying to poof divine beliefs through science is incredible.
-They do not mention the 'pure language' that is a key part of the beginning of the novel.
-The last preferiti did not die.
-Vittoria was not kidnapped by the Hassassins.
-There was not fight at Sant'Angello Castle.
-Robert did not find the Church of Iluminations by himself but he was told by the prefiriti that was supposed to be dead.
-Robert did not get into the helicopter with the Camarlengo, so he did not jump out of it in middle air.
-The Camarlengo should have appeared in the top of the Capella Sistina not had fallen into the crowd.
