Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the most iconic films of all time!
","The movie begins in the jungles of South America- a place full of wonder and mystery (a prime spot for our main character Dr Henry Walton Jones Jr or Indiana as he prefers to be called). We later learn that Indy is a Professor of archaeology but has a far more interesting life outside the office as a daring adventurer. On his journeys he encounters interesting characters such as Belloq and Arnold toht along with his friend Salah and of course his sort of girlfriend Marion and many other evil Nazis.The practical effects in this movie are superb especially for the 80s- (better than some effects today). These scenes include: the boulder that chases Indy through the deserted tomb, the escape from the underground system and the gruesome yet awesome face melting scene. Other great action scenes that are so iconic include the truck scene where Indy gradually makes his way to the drivers seat and of course the fight by the on coming propeller blades. All so suspenseful and entertaining!I adore Spielberg and Lucas movies more than any others so its no surprise that this film is one of my all time favourites. Lucas' writing is just wonderful it opens up a new world like in the Star Wars saga. And Spielberg's directing brings it all to life so they obviously make the perfect duo. This is indeed Ford's best performance (he really does suit Indy) and drives the film as the leading role. William's score also makes the film as he does every time without disappointment.I love this movie as you can tell already I couldn't recommend it enough! I give this film a 9.4/10 can't think of any faults in particular. A awesome movie that will remain one of the best for years to come!",9,2,5,25 November 2014
It," Pennywise the dancing clown
","Stephen King is a genius and the vast majority of his work is great and worth spending your money on, be it the books or the adapted movies or both. So as a fan of King and his intriguing work I thought I'd give this film a watch. From the appearance of the 'Warner Bros' logo we are immediately sent into the town of Derry where a very atmospheric and effective first encounter with Pennywise occurs. The element that was so great about the miniseries was encapsulated in the introduction of this film, being the played innocence of Pennywise in persuading Georgie to take the boat with the untold sinister intent of killing him later. From that first appearance of Pennywise we don't get another one like it.... Instead we get jump scare after jump scare. Some I realised were necessary and had some weight to them but others felt forced and formulaic. And it seemed as though (due to all of the advertising)the movie had to show Pennywise past the appropriate amount of times until he was just about as scary as one of the kids moms. That being said I enjoyed the banter had by 'The Losers club' and the solid acting by the kids. The story as a whole was also entertaining (even though I'm not the biggest horror film fan)and Bill Skarsgard did a good job as Pennywise especially when he used subtle movements and mannerisms. There are some scenes that are exceptionally disturbing then some which are comical which I also liked.The ending was okay, I'm on the fence about it. They came together as emphasized because they are technically a 'club' to defeat Pennywise and overcome their fears. But then at times during the end fight it felt silly and too 'in your face.' However all in all it was a well shot, well acted and well written adaptation of the one thousand and something page novel that will satisfy the majority of film goers and some fans of the novel.7.5/10",7,4,9,11 September 2017
Suicide Squad," A wasted opportunity for DCs cinematic universe
","I went into this film with reasonably high expectations (despite the fact that I generally dislike superhero movies) due to their predictable plots, 2 dimensional characters and cheesy jokes not to mention the reality that films such as this are being heartlessly made on a production line like canned food for profit not art as they should be. Anyway with that out of the way I thought 'well its DC (my preferred universe over Marvel) and it seems to have interesting characters that I may grow to like throughout the film as they develop.' I couldn't have been more wrong. The film opens with an extremely rushed introduction to the 'Heroes' or 'Villains' (however you want to look at it) with only a few minutes dedicated to an entire character we're supposed to like or at least like enough for the entire 2 hour run time (great). Overuse of popular songs in our introduction is an understatement (I thought I was watching countless music videos one after another, not an effective beginning at all). The tone of this film is all over the place one minute its light hearted and supposedly 'funny' and the next it cuts to the Joker shooting someone in the face for no apparent reason. Speaking of the Joker he could have been cut out of this movie and NOTHING would have changed. 'But I wonder why he was on all of the posters and ads' you may ask, well I can answer that: MONEY! This goes for practically all superhero movies instead of making films that can stand on their own they need to connect to endless spin offs and sequels which some suckers will pay to see. The plot was another thing that didn't make sense Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis who created the 'Suicide Squad' was also the individual who caused the threat which caused the death of two members. The threat being the 'Enchantress' played by Cara Delevingne (who could not act or dance). Scenes seemed to flash backwards and forwards randomly and added nothing to the film. And despite the fact that this film was supposed to be 'Cool', 'edgy' and maybe kind of original we get the exact boring and pointless endings in many superhero films: the laser in the sky with the fitting 'I'm evil and I want to take over the world' clich√©. (another reason why I dislike these films). Another thing to add was the amount of awful looking CGI and bad villain soldier designs, for a $175 million budget! It is fairly obvious that I really didn't like this film but I will say that the concept was interesting if executed right, some of the flashbacks were intriguing- most notably the Jokers, the look of the main characters was fitting and the gritty aspects were nice. I just wanted those aspects and a coherent story with less characters so you'd have more time for the few therefore deeper and more meaningful backgrounds are established so you'd actually care when they died (or nearly did). If it was like 'Watchmen' which I thoroughly enjoyed and expected this to be it may have restored hope for DC and renewed my interest in superhero films as a whole. But I guess that was too much to ask....",4,1,1,25 July 2017
Interstellar," Interesting concept!
","This movie is all about how love is the most powerful force in the universe no matter where you are and what is happening. Such as the many light years away Cooper and Murph are as he travels to another galaxy hoping to find a habitable world for us as the new Earth .McConaughey is great as the lead role and the connection between him and his daughter tugs at the heart strings so you really feel her pain when he travels into the darkness of space. The CGI in this movie is very impressive (quite close to that of Gravity for the most part). You really feel the conditions the characters endure in their small vessel in comparison to the vastness of the Universe. The story is fascinating as it does feel really real! They did get the science right (no sound traveling in space) so this adds to the realism. The score is very good to fit specific situations they endure.The things I didn't like about this movie was the pace and the length of it. Some scenes weren't very engaging when you understood what was happening and it seemed to drag especially at the end when he returned to his dying daughter (which was very surreal). Overall I give this film a 7.8 because of its interesting plot, great acting and breathtaking effects. But seems to drag on in certain times and gets a tad bit boring.",8,0,3,18 November 2014
The Theory of Everything," A brief history of Stephen's life!
",I went into this film with quite a good knowledge of Hawking's life and works from the book 'a brief history of time' and various documentaries. So I didn't think I'd learn anything new. But I was surprised when I found out about the effect the disease had on Jane and the rest of their family.This was due to the superb acting from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones.Jane (Jones) is a determined woman who wouldn't stop at anything to see Stephen through the difficult times he endures; without Jane Stephen may not be with us today (today being his 73rd birthday) and so we may have been missing out on the expansion of knowledge in the Physics world that he still offers.I was also surprised that Jane had another love interest during her relationship with Stephen. This was sad to see from all of the support she had given him but I guess she thought it was time.The only negative things about this inspiring film is the pacing and lack of science. I know it's the story of Stephen and Jane but surely they could of added more. Anyway I did enjoy this uplifting story so I give it a 7.8/10 recommended especially if your a fan of love stories and the brilliant professor!,7,1,1,8 January 2015
The Green Mile," A very touching film
","John Coffey is a kind, loving and peaceful man who only wants happiness and for everyone to get along. Sadly the film is set in America during the great depression (1930s) so racism is part of everyday life and so characters are blinded by this factor and so judge a book by its cover, Coffey is that misunderstood individual (until the end that is).The acting in this movie is top notch and it has been almost perfectly adapted from the great novel by Stephen King, along with fantastic casting and most importantly the key emotional aspect is present throughout the film too.When reading the book I hated the character of Percy with a passion and was so happy with his downfall, but in the movie I despised him even more this was due to the realistic evil glimmer in his eye when he crushed Mr Jingles or whacked Delacroix with his baton and his sarcastic nature that he used time and time again made me want to punch him repeatedly in the face as did many of his co workers. So well done to Dutch Hutchinson for really bringing this b*****d of a character to life! The film reminds us that we all have our own Green mile we must walk when we reach the end of our lives but we do not know when or how, we must enjoy the time we have and get to know people for who they are and not what they seem to be.Overall this film is very saddening and will surely make you feel many different emotions at once in a matter of 3 hours, that you will never forget. A 9.2/10.",9,0,1,18 February 2015
Jaws," One of the Best Monster movies of all time!
","Jaws. The film that will haunt you every time you go swimming in the ocean. What a great film! Fantastic acting from Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss on the edge of your chair suspense (due to the memorable score by John Williams) and a superb ending.This film really hits home and tugs at the heart strings when each victim is consumed by the terrifyingly large fish that scars the lives of the victims families and engraves itself inside of them. You get close to the 3 main characters- Brody, Quint and Hooper thereby understanding what type of characters they are and how they'd react in certain situations so this shows how well Spielberg presents his interesting cast to the audience.We care about these characters and their goals to put an end to the monster's life so this makes it all the more tragic when it doesn't go to plan. Out of the three I can relate most to Hooper, who isn't used to a fisher man's life and seems to be content on focusing on the academic side of things.There are a lot of hilarious moments when Quint and Hooper verbally fight and the sarcastic and dark nature of Hooper's humour provides that light hearted side to this Horror film.The tension building up to the ending does indeed pay off, it would be a sin if Hollywood were to remake this classic as they'd never capture the great personalities of the characters or the suspenseful moments that this film brings. I give this film a 8.4/10 -highly recommended!",9,1,3,19 December 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The weakest link
","I was really excited for this movie especially when I found out about the 45 minute battle sequence. But all there was was a over use of CGI that got annoying, characters that weren't supposed to be in the film defining gravity and such and also the acting wasn't anything special either.It was hard to get into, unlike desolation of Smaug which I thought was really good (the first time anyway) and Unexpected journey seemed to take you to middle earth in a more efficient way than this movie.Despite the many battle sequences involved non of them seemed to grip you and you didn't really care about the characters because the orcs and goblins weren't anything menacing that could harm anyone. Not a 'creature bred for war' at all. They reminded me of the battle droids from the Star Wars prequels that are just there to make the heroes look more impressive which they do at times but can get quite repetitive.The movie constantly attempts to be the LOTR but generally fails. However some moments are entertaining to watch that relate to the style such as the vast armies of evil and their chants whilst they march. The references to LOTR are quite impressive but we have seen them before so nothing really new. I did however like the fact that Christopher Lee made a awesome appearance although he wasn't in the book I don't mind to much as he's one of my favourite actors and favourite villain from LOTR so it was interesting to see him fighting for the forces of good- 'leave Sauron to me'.Overall though I give it a 6.8/10 which really does kill me inside as I am a huge LOTR fan and I did enjoy the first two hobbit movies but this one just isn't there. It makes me sad that Peter Jackson kind of rushed this movie just to make the linkage with LOTR. From all of the hard work that has gone into the previous films seems to have been neglected for this ending (probably due to there being 3 movies) to the final installment of this partly epic saga.",6,1,4,19 December 2014
