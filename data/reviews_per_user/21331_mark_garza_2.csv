Requiem for a Dream," Sublime, masterful filmmaking.........
","I saw Requiem for the first time back in November, and I've seen it numerous times since that unforgetable initial viewing.  This masterpiece has left an indelible impression on me, and for this, I am truly thankful to Darren Aronofsky. For me, this film evokes passions and emotions that I've truly never felt before, and that's quite an accomplishment for a film. Throughout each viewing, I remain truly captivated and saddened by the downward spiral that the characters experience, courtesy of Aronofsky and author Hubert Selby, Jr..  Since many of the reviewers on this site have already included a synopsis of some sort, I will exclude any sort of summary, and will attempt to expand on the general mood of the movie, and how it is achieved.
In an effort to convey the abject pain and despair his characters experience, Aronofsky tactfully and deftly employs just about every trick in the book. Each scene utilizes some sort of clever camera angle, and the colors he uses always seem to be congruous with the mood of the film: dark and dreary.  Actually, the aesthetics in general only serve to bolster the lightless depravity of Requiem.  Also, Aronofsky does a masterful job at squeezing out the absolute most out of every actor/actress in this production.  Contrary to what many people have posted, he does delve a little into each character (this is done in varying degrees), and while I couldn't empathize with any of the characters, I definitely did sympathize with their plight.  Finally,  Clint Mansel and the Kronos Quartet have added the most indefectible original score ever, in my opinion.  As great as the film is, it just would not be the same without the haunting, chilling music.
So much more could be said, but as you can see, so many have already skillfully expounded their feelings in this forum.  I can only say that for me, no movie will ever elicit such powerful emotion from me again.  Even after numerous viewings, I am still completely spellbound by this well-crafted magnum opus.  I am not a fan of the Batman franchise, but it will certainly be interesting to see what Aronofsky can do with this sinking ship.",Null,0,0,6 July 2001
Am√©lie," 2001 Film of the Year
","In a year of film that was enmeshed in mediocrity, there was one effulgent star that shined far brighter than the rest.  That film was Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, 'Amelie.'  Jeunet adeptly exacts excellence in all aspects of this film.  His use of colors and cinematography is magnificent, and the acting is first rate.  Audrey Tautou proves to be more than proficient at capturing the nuances of her character.  Every word she utters, and every face she makes, leave no doubt in your mind that she was born to play the part of Amelie.  Also, her surrounding cast are effective at both complimenting Amelie's character, and establishing themselves as part of this truly captivating tale.Further, director Jeunet proves his worth in the use of subtleties to help paint the larger picture.  I've actually seen this work of art twice, and the second viewing was actually much better than the first.  Many of the details that initially seemed inconsequential, actually turned out to be quite prophetic in the end.  Pay close attention to the details of Amelie's solitary childhood, and how it ushers in her inability to truly communicate with others.  This is just one example of Jeunet's effort in this carefully crafted work.  In short, he does a masterful job of tying together many details, and thus, artfully presenting a film that will leave you begging for more.Finally, the soundtrack is indeed the crowning jewel of 'Amelie.'  An already great film is enhanced much further by Yann Tiersen's stroke of genius.  Unfortunately, I was so enraptured with the film the first time, that the music was taken in more on a subconscious level.  Upon reading about the soundtrack, I made a concerted effort to pay more attention to the music the second time.  Thank goodness I made the effort, because the music adds to the film in grand fashion.If you haven't seen 'Amelie,' run, don't walk to the theatre.  If you saw a better movie in 2001, I'd like to know what it is!!",10,1,3,4 January 2002
