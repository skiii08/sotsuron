Walk the Line," my random thoughts about the movie
","I loved this movie....and the fact that I am totally and more than a little obsessively crazy about Joaquin Phoenix has nothing to do with it! I was impressed with his singing (even though I had already bought the soundtrack before I saw the movie) and just everything about this movie was phenomenal. It was much funnier than I thought it was going to be, I was pleasantly surprised with that. Reese was impressive as well and they had great chemistry together. It was very believable. This movie was very entertaining and held my interest the whole time. The I highly recommend this movie...I will probably be going again and definitely will buy it when it comes out on DVD!",10,0,1,29 November 2005
