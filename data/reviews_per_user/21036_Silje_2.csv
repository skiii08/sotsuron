Ghost," Beautiful
","This is one of my favourite films, I just bought my own copy of it! The love between Sam and Molly is described extremely good, so pure and deep. And they managed to show a strong and passionate lovescene; without making it into pornography. (That's well done in film I think.) Patrick Swayze plays uncredible good at the last scene where he and Molly meet again, and he cries while he is dancing with her (in Oda Maye's body.) I love the music: 'Unchained melody' is beautiful. As the movie.",Null,1,2,23 January 1999
American Beauty," My life seems to be captured on film
","I was in a state of shock after I saw this film. All of my life I've tried to show the world how I look at it through poems, short-stories, paintings, drawings and photographs..and then..suddenly this film. The guy with the camera was..me..! The only way I haven't tried to show the world through my eyes, is what he chose though - filming.Now, small differences..he says that he stood next to a woman while she was freezing to death..I would never do that. And I avoid drugs, but I can see why people want to use it. And we are both depressives.. this film affected *my* life. I think it could on yours too.The actors were..amazing. I remember the boy's eyes, and the fathers face when he worked out in the garage, and got filmed..he got an oscar for that, well deserved. I really recommend this film.",Null,0,0,3 April 2000
