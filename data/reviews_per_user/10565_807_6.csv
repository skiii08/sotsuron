Alien 3," Piotr St. says: Pink Floyd - 'Animals'
","On March 24, 1973, Pink Floyd blew the roof off the dump with their greatest album to date, 'The Dark Side Of The Moon', one of the most inspiring, powerful and classic albums of the whole rock history. On September 15, 1975, they did something no one expected: they came with an album, being almost exact continuation of Dark Side..., but with a few changes in style (long, constructed compositions as opposed to short songs from TDSOTM) 'Wish You Were Here', also considered as classical. However, nothing happens twice, and their successor, 'Animals', presented to the audience on January 23, 1977, was a good, solid album, but didn't stand comparison to its precedessors.OK, but what about Alien?It's almost the same story. In 1979, 'Alien' blasted everybody right into Space: incredibly challenging meteor, still standing incredibly fresh even now. In 1986, a continuation appeared, James Cameron's 'Aliens'. Once again, this was not a direct continuation (it couldn't be! NOW we all knew how Alien exactly look like, so the suspense of the first one was gone; now there were the only unknown thing - when, where and how aliens attack; and we had dozens of monsters instead of one and a bunch of marines instead of simply workers), but was also good as f**k.But you can't have three masterpieces in a row, and Alien 3 simply couldn't outclass its precedessors, or even be equal to them. This might be caused by rather large changes the producers made to the original film (and mediocre level of 'Animals' might be considered as a result of Roger Waters' autocratic domination on the Floyds). However, it stands pretty well, with its grimy, claustrophobic atmosphere and industrial settings. I have to admit I like this one, despite its faults (major bullshit: persons of YY chromosomes! An explanation: These are two types of human chromosomes, X and Y. Women have an XX combination, while men have XY. However, X chromosome is the only one that carries all features; Y doesn't carry anything, so the person having an YY couldn't exist because ovarium would ALWAYS give an X chromosome; and if even, by some very rare and strange mutation, such combination would appear, it would die immediately after conception).7/10 (The Floyd-Alien similarities end here; the next Floydian slip, 'The Wall', was a masterpiece; the next movie doesn't.)",7,0,2,8 February 2003
Alien," Piotr St. says: A Classic.
","An incredible one. Fully stood the test of time. You can visit this 1979 meteor anytime and it is still fresh, scary and challenging. The beginning of (so far) a quadralogy (one sequel great, one fine, one mediocre). A Must! 10/10",10,0,1,8 February 2003
The Bourne Identity," Good
","While this movie purports to be an adaptation of Robert Ludlum's classic action novel, it actually borrows some of the main plot points, and nothing more. Which actually is a quite good decision: this new, 2000s-updated version of a story, in which a man, found floating unconsciously in the Mediterranean Sea and suffering from a total amnesia, slowly starts picking up pieces of his forgotten past as a undercover agent, actually works. 'The Bourne Identity' is a decent action flick, with lots of high-speed chases and hand-to-hand combat scenes; Matt Damon is very believable and natural as the title character, and Franka Potente as his love interest shows why she could be regarded as the modern cinema's overlooked gem. Chris Cooper also shines as the bad guy, although he is unlucky to share many scenes with the late Brian Cox, and Cox always had the ability to steal the scene whenever he appears on screen, and this movie is no exception. A good action flick. 8/10",8,2,2,23 June 2011
Spider-Man," Piotr St. says: CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!!!
","Omigosh!!!! How can ANYONE give this film more than 3 (except from TY and WD fans) remains a mystery for me.First of all this one is FOR LITTLE CHILDREN ONLY. I know that comic books adaptations are not meant to be, say, A Clockwork Orange, but do yourself a favor and go watch Batman (1989) - it's a great pleasure. Thanks to great director and of course Mr. Nicholson. And it still stands well: its dark mood, photography, and dark poetry have transcended well into 2002. In comparison this one is simply pathetic. Only special effects, and wery weak, naive screenplay. Why do you Americans take us all as fvols?!Spider-Man is a deadly boring movie: I watched this at a cinema and everybody was loudly laughing anytime when '...with great power comes great responsibility blah blah blah...' came from the screen. Many people left before the film has ended, saying 'LAME!', or 'Crap'. There is nothing new, we have seen many films of superheroes and this one is simply re-make of all cliches you can imagine.I can't understand why this one earned so many money: I think it was because there were no good releases at the same time. If released together with Attack Of The Clones, this would hit the bottom faster than Titanic did.Not worth any minute of your life.1/10 - just because there is no 0.",1,8,21,8 August 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Piotr St. says: Unique experience
","I've rewieved 3 movies so far and I gave all of them 1/10. But don't worry. This movie does not deserve it.(Some spoilers possible, depending on what do you understand as 'a spoiler') 2001: A Space Odyssey is an special and unique movie. Unlike almost all others, this one tends to use as little words as possible, the story is told mostly by the pictures and the music - and so, this may be the ONLY complete movie in history, telling EVERYTHING by images, not by words. The book gave a strong explanation of everything: the film simply presents you the pictures (I love one of it: an ape throws a bone in the air, and it, slowly floating down, suddenly turns into a spaceship floating in space - 4 millions of years of evolution and history of mankind, all turn into ONE SINGLE CUT!!!! Incredible.), and leaves all explanation up to you.Definitely 10/10.",10,0,2,8 February 2003
Trainspotting," Piotr St. says: Fecal Poetry.
","Trainspotting may be one of the most shocking movies ever, describing drug addiction from deep within. The film presents world seen thru the syringe, cold, terrifying, depressing.Ewan McGregor is great as Mark Renton, drug addict trying to change his life. Thumbs up also for Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle as mad, psychotic Francis Begbie.(spoilers) The shortest description of Trainspotting: fecal poetry. This refers to the scene in which Renton loses his opiumic suppositories and desperately dives in a water closet (a REAL DIRTY one), and suddenly he appears into some imagined, vision sea, diving deep and finding his suppositories. Disgusting, but also intriguing. 9/10.",9,0,1,8 February 2003
