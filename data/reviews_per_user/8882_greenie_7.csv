The Blair Witch Project," A frightening, suspenseful, and enjoyable experience.
","All that really needs to be said about this movie is that it succeeds where nearly every other movie in its genre fails.'Blair' derives its best chills from those that everyone has experienced at some point in their lives -- and many will experience again. There is no fear like that of the unknown. Add in hopelessness, despair and an inability to instantly remove onesself from a situation, I really don't see what could be more frightening, nor could I imagine a film that portrays these feelings any better.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A stunning achievement in visual flim making.
","All Lucas ever wanted to do is tell a good story and use every facility within his disposal to do so.He accomplished that amazing well with A New Hope in 1977. He does it again today with Phantom Menace.This movie is not made for the critics, nor for those who choose to judge it based on its stand-alone ability. It's made for those who already know the stories, the characters, and the universe.As such, it is an absolute joy not just to learn more of the beginnings but to actually SEE them. To see so many different worlds, different creatures and different situations is an absolute dream. To me, this is the first Star Wars movie that allows us to get a true scope of Lucas' vision of this far, far away galaxy.To those who criticise the dialogue, I can't argue. There are no snappy one-liners -- thankfully so. Jar Jar's lines can be annoying, but that is his character. Hell, C-3PO always annoyed me too, I never liked his dialogue. Young Anakin's dialogue is weak, but perhaps that's because it's written as a 9-year old (Jedi or not) would actually speak. Trust me, listening to all those yapping kids in line gave me insight as to how idiotic they'd sound while flying pod racers around.As for the plot of this movie and the pace of the storyline, I don't need dialogue or specific action to help me with this. The perfection and beauty of the visuals -- effects, costumes, paintings, sets and CGI -- are so remarkable they are a story onto themselves.And since when did Star Wars have a 'human' element in it? The core of the series -- The Force -- is something that transcends species, that has both good and evil. Like the immersive audiovisual experience of this film, it's the thing that surrounds us and binds everything together.If you're a Star Wars fan this movie is nothing short of a joyous experience. If you're a moderate movie fan who enjoys adventurous, escapist fantasies then it is a delight to watch.The only people that I can't perceive enjoying this film are those who never liked other visually-driven movies and even storybooks, such as 'Where The Wild Things Are.'",9,0,0,20 May 1999
Blade," Vampire hunting with a fun twist.
","Summer popcorn moviegoing at it's most basic -- the kind of movie that makes you wish the serials came back. Good action, good acting (for an action flick), tons of blood, limited one-liners, and a few unique plot twists. Great intro to the plot and the key characters.Slight cons with this movie: some of the interesting characters are underdeveloped while the boring ones are overdeveloped, and the finale lacks truly gripping suspense -- although it is quite a visual treat.",7,0,1,12 September 1998
Saving Private Ryan," There are many better 'war movies,' but not as visual
","Yet another movie that is considered great simply because the name Spielberg is attached. If not for the hyper-realistic combat scenes, this film would simply be average.On the plus side, the movie takes full advantage of today's audiovisual technology to provide the most immersive film experience dealing with war - - any war. The violence is so realistic and plentiful it's at times desensitizing, a common feeling among soldiers in World War II.On the negative side, the movie revolves around the gore and the combat, and as a result fails to resolve many of the questions the movie raises -- namely whether risking an entire group is worth saving one man.There are many other movies that more strongly illustrate the wide range of attitudes, emotions, and pure brutality of war; among those, All Quiet On The Western Front (the original), The Big Red One, and Platoon involve the viewer on a much deeper emotional and intellectual level than this film.",8,0,0,12 September 1998
Detroit Rock City," Remember going to your first rock concert?
","For many of us growing up, the experience of going to your first BIG concert is an unforgettable, fantastic experience. In many cases it's not the concert itself that we remember, rather the days and hours leading up to the concert, the excitement of the crowd, and sharing the experience with your friends. Perhaps the most memorable experience however, was the simple fact that you made it to the show, a true coming of age for many teens.DETROIT ROCK CITY reminds us of all these obstacles and emotions with a 1978 rock-and-roll backdrop. While the KISS concert may be the ultimate goal of the four friends in this movie, the band (and thankfully, its music) takes a backseat to the characters themselves, and what they're willing to go through to make it there. KISS becomes little more than a piece of scenery, really.While this movie will be enjoyed by anyone who has experienced this -- or are currently -- those who grew up through the 70s will enjoy it the most. Exceptional attention to 70s detail is everywhere, with particular attention paid to 1978 itself. The soundtrack is full of songs released in 1977-1978 (and almost entirely non-KISS) and the selection works well to supplement how the characters feel and the situations they encounter.While no movie may ever compare to DAZED AND CONFUSED when it comes to capturing the life of a teenager in the 70s, DETROIT ROCK CITY is a very welcome, funny, and enjoyable addition to this genre.",7,0,1,14 August 1999
Any Given Sunday," Same old, same old.
","I was hoping Oliver Stone would at least come up with something new and/or different when using American Football as his subject matter. Perhaps he was too concerned with his more-than-a-cameo role as a broadcaster to pay attention to the fact that he was making a bland movie with uninteresting characters and a recycled plot.In this film we're blessed with: - The old coach who many think is past his time - Veteran players who forego injuries for one more win - Young hotshots who don't care about the team - The meddling owner who cares only about the bottom line - The zany defensive players - Flashy offensive players - The must-have-drugs-to-kill-the-pain attitude - Sardonic, overly critical sports reporters - Cameos from football players and coaches, past and present... pretty much playing themselvesWith uneven editing and writing, incongruous dialogue and the total lack of ANYTHING fresh in this film, the only saving grace of the movie is that the football sequences are filmed quite well, with both accurate and creative sound editing to help the atmosphere. However, even these sequences fail to fulfill completely, as they are too replete with a fast-cut, MTV-style of editing with the audience bombasted throughout by loud, obtrusive music. No original score here, the film's 'score' is merely a marketing machine to sell CDs.Stone makes the world of professional (American) football seem so cut-and-dry by using every cliche there is; each character and action is nothing we haven't seen before in another movie, or every week on TV and in the newspapers.And at 165 minutes, one wonders why some scenes weren't cut entirely, as many of them do little, if anything, to either further the plot or offer a closer look into this world.5 out of 10.",5,0,0,24 December 1999
The Matrix," Fantastic blend of thinking sci-fi and action
","The usual formula: Cyberpunk thriller + Keanu Reeves = SlopSomehow the directors and writers of The Matrix make it work, and incredible well. A strong plot and tight screenwriting benefit from believable character performances that are built up strongly.One of the best things about this movie is that it doesn't throw you right in to the Matrix itself. Naturally you're given a slight tease at the start of the movie, but you're taken on the tour along with the characters as their realities begin to unravel and expand.Initially I thought I might criticise the movie for too action that goes a little too far over the top; after a day's thought however it's understandable that should the Matrix itself actually exist, most anything would happen over the top.Some incredible groundbreaking special effects and photography, pushing the new field of stop-motion rotophotography to limits that have never been seen before. While the Phantom Menace will surely walk away with this year's awards for FX, the Matrix deserves a spot in the hall of fame for pushing the field beyond any other movie -- even the subtle shots are brilliantly composited, lit, and animated.The art direction in this movie is also extremely well done. Imagine mixing the look, feel and martial arts of The Crow with the futuristic vision of Metropolis and Dark City. Most every shot is filled with fantastic detail, from set direction to matte painting and cgi backgrounds.There should be a lot of talk about this movie, and I'm sure many will detract it. There will surely be a lot of sci-fi fans that will choose to look for holes in the plot, inaccuracies and conflicting concepts. Of course, these are the same fans that can see none of the same in movies from Star Wars to Blade Runner.I will admit I walked in with extremely low expectations, but I have since waited on writing this review and prolonged thought on the film has provided me with a great appreciation.Besides, any sci-fi movie with such a strong plot and fantastic effects that manages to throw in a fantastic homage to Return Of The Dragon (the Bruce Lee - Chuck Norris fight, to be exact) will long sit in my memory.",9,0,0,2 April 1999
