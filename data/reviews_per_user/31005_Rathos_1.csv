Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The movie was great
","First, I want to say I loved the movie.  It was complete eye candy, and the lightsaber duels put the first movies to shame.  I waited for 20 hours in line for opening day 12:01 am showing.  I did expect a little too much, I mean the actors were great, the story line had great potential, and no one can deny the great special effects.The one problem with this movie is George Lucas had too much control over it. Whenever a human would speak the movie went down hill.  They didn't have any great lines like 'Going into light speed isn't like dusting crops boy.' With Lucas controlling the movie he didn't have anyone telling him the dialogue was crap.  All in all, the movie was worth it, but it really made me wonder how the next ones are going to be.",10,0,1,24 May 1999
