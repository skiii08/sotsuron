Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visual spectacular, new characters and big cheers
","Fortunate to be in the states on the 19th of May I was thrilled to be able to buy a ticket for an early morning viewing.  The theatre was packed with similar 25-35 year olds desperate to recapture the magic of the first trilogy.  They were not disappointed despite the early criticism.  The components are all there.  The best feature is the special effects, not just their technical competency but also the breadth of the imagination displayed in new worlds, creatures and cultures.  The first half of the film burns slowly as we adapt to the new characters and try to work out the ultimate direction of the plot.  Far from the plot being poor the second half provides nice twists and a good turn of pace which led to several large cheers from an admittedly sympathetic audience.  Particularly breathtaking are the beautifully choreographed fight scenes(worth a second look I think). Go see this film, hang your disbelief outside and watch in sympathy.  You will enjoy.  The legend grows.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
Van Helsing," Over blown tosh
",Only going to mention a few of the reasons the movie lost me. 1 After the failure of league of extraordinary gentleman why bother using another failed Jekyl/Hyde CGI disaster.  Did not add anything.  2 Why add more rope swinging than a Tarzan movie.  3 Why waste the fantastic sex appeal of both the leading characters.  Costume design one high point of the whole thing.  Such a shame as you could see the care in the opening that it led to overblown shots that wasted the truely sinister nature of vampires and their blood sucking biology.  I am truly upset and angry about this movie.  A big CGI budget should be used sparingly.  The Mummy let you marvel at flesh eating scarabs and sinister sandstorms but here the effects just bored.  Remember less is sometimes so much more.,5,0,0,13 May 2004
Les Mis√©rables," Loved it loved it Loved it
","OK, so I know the music, never seen on stage: so perhaps this is a rating that goes with the first time you see LM : 10/10. I was so emotional at the end I couldn't even speak and needed a very big scarf to both mop up my tears and hide my face. They will criticise some of the vocals but they are real and come from actors singing live and perhaps thats why this grips the emotions. Great acting great songs and wow Anne Hathaway has created one of those movie scenes that joins my top ten. Without a doubt this is one of the best films I have ever seen and not been this blown away since NCFOM (thats there to recover some shred of masculinity seeing as I have been a blubbering wreck on the way back home)",10,6,10,12 January 2013
Titanic," Can't believe they wasted a good movie with such a poor script
",The special effects are of course ground breaking and the main redeeming feature of this overblown epic.  Unfortunately the plot and the dialogue are immensely disappointing and cause one to twitch and turn away.  Motion sickness bags should have been provided.  Would it not have been so much better if the protagonists had been a little less black and white.  Then a masterpiece could have been built on that wonderful background of one of the most compelling tragedies of the 20th century.,4,2,3,5 April 1999
