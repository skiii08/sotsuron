The Blair Witch Project," So-so movie with a great ending
","Don't worry, I'm not going to give the ending away for those few of you who still haven't see this movie.This was a movie which began as a sleeper, but quickly gathered a lot of hype.  Although I thought the movie was just OK, I probably would have liked it a lot more if I hadn't heard all the hoopla.  Also, I would have appreciated it more if I knew that the movie was largely improvised (and shot) by the players themselves.  And I thought the ending (which, as I said, I won't reveal) was fantastic.  All in all, I suppose it was worth being totally annoyed by the three protagonists for the first two-thirds of the movie.Rating on my Manos scale: 30 out of 10.",Null,0,1,2 January 2000
Vertigo," A Masterpiece
","This one ranks high on my list of all-time best films (I could never really bring myself to name one as my single favorite).  Alfred Hitchcock was a very great director, and made many films which could be called great.  But this was the best of the lot!  To go through the plot would take up too much time and space, as it is very, very complicated.  Suffice to say that the writing, the direction, and the performances have an intensity which have never quite been equalled.  Oh, heck!  See the film yourself!  You'll see what I mean!By the way, Hitchcock never won an Oscar for Best Directior, despite making several magnificent films (and many many more very good ones, too) during his 35+ years in Hollywood (not to mention some 20 years in Britain before that).  That reflects very poorly on the AMPAS, I should say.",Null,2,4,6 June 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Great movie? I dunno....
","I know this is apt to be a minority opinion, and I hope this doesn't hurt the feelings of the trillion or so people who really love this movie, but I didn't really care for it.  I saw it at the end of the summer of 1982 after hearing for several weeks that it was the greatest movie ever made in the history of the universe.  I thought it was a nice movie, very pleasant, very charming, and very well-crafted.  Mr. Spielberg definitely knows what he's doing when it comes to putting a movie together.  But is the greatest film ever made, or even a great film period?  I'm sincerely sorry, but I honestly don't think so.'Didn't live up to the hype' is how I thought of it at them time.  Still, I can think of many worse ways to pass a sweltering summer afternoon.",Null,0,1,31 August 2000
The Big Lebowski," The Funniest Movie Ever
","The debate continues among the Coen Brothers' fans as to whether this movie measures up to its predecessor, 'Fargo'.  As good as 'Fargo' is, this movie is much more fun to watch.  I saw this movie in Harvard Square in the spring of '98, and I can't recall ever laughing so hard in a movie theater.It's a great film in so many ways, but the writing is what really makes it shine.  The interplay between the Dude, Walter and Donny is perfectly timed, as is their run-ins with Jesus the Bowler.  All of the actors' performances are excellent, and the special effects in the dream sequences are first-rate.  This movie hit me just right, and has held up well in repeated viewings.  Very highly recommended!",10,0,1,3 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," One of the few movies out there worth seeing
","It must be said that this not not one of filmdom's Golden Ages.  Just about every film being released these days uses mega-hype (including irritating product tie-ins everywhere) and mind-numbing special effects in an attempt to obscure the film's predictability, bad writing, formulaic plot, irritating characters, maudlin and inappropriately placed sentimentality, stupid catchphrases, and overall smug self-importance which assumes that their average audience has the colective intelligence of a burlap bag full of moose livers. Now that I have that little rant out of the way, I'll say that 'South Park' is about the only movie I found to be worth seeing this year.  By South Park's standards, it's average; in other words, it's about as funny as any of the TV episodes (which I think is pretty darned funny). Compared to every other movie out there, though, it is a work of genius! Behind the crude jokes and overall bad taste lies real honest-to goodness satire!  (In an age like ours which begs to be lampooned, I'm often bemused at how little real satire is out there.)One caveat: this movie is R-rated for a reason.  It's pretty raunchy.  In a strange case of life imitating art, while Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman were at the Terrance and Phillip movie, I looked around the theater where I was and saw it full of kids!  How did they ever get in to see this one?",Null,0,0,31 July 1999
The Grapes of Wrath," Ford's best (and that says a lot)
","John Ford, one of Hollywood's greatest directors, practically hero-worshipped by no less than Orson Welles, made many great movies in his illustrious career, but this is probably his best.  His sure-handed direction, combined with Greg Toland's excellent cinematography, Nunally Johnson's first rate script (faithfully following Steinbeck's great novel), and top-notch acting by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine, and the rest, many of then John Ford regulars, make for an unforgettable portrait of an an America, which, although only existing 60 or so years ago, is completely unrecognizable today.  A sad and beautiful film.",Null,1,4,8 August 1999
Fargo," 'Little things mean a lot...'
","What I really love about this movie, as with all the Coens' movies, are the small eccentric touches.  The boy in his room, fretting over his kidnapped mother, and with a poster on the wall that says 'Polka Kings', and shows a lederhosen-clad accordion player (as well as the accordion and sheet music in his room).  But better still are the small roles: the irate customer ('These guys!  It's always more!'), Mr. Mohra ('..she says I should call it in, so I called it in.  End of story.'), Mike Yamagita (Steve Park from In Living Color!), etc.  And of course, Frances McDormand's very pregnant police chief with a mind like Sherlock Holmes is perhaps the most appealing character I've seen in any movie.Also, I love that haunting theme music.  There's so much more I could say about this movie, but it's probably already been said.   Destined to be a classic.",Null,0,0,13 June 1999
BASEketball," A no-brainer
","To be honest, I did not want to like this movie.  But I did anyway; this movie is very funny. The humor is very crude and childish, but at least it is not predictable. Turn off your brain for a while, watch and enjoy...",Null,1,2,6 August 1999
Being John Malkovich," Stunningly amoral
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie; from what I had heard, it seemed that it was very funny.Well, it _was_ very funny, although the movie's weirdness seemed at times to be a bit forced, as if it were being weird just for weirdness' sake.  (I won't get into details about the movie, partly because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, and partly because it's too weirdly convoluted.)  But as much as I laughed (especially at the beginning), and as much as I really wanted to enjoy this movie, I came away from it feeling strangely hollow.What really turned me off is that all the characters (including, sadly, Cameron Diaz, who I _really_ wanted to like) turned out to be such jerks! I'm talking no core moral values here!  No mercy!  No pity!  No looking out for the other guy!  I mean it, there was not one person in this movie who had any ultimately redeeming characteristics.Maybe that was the real message of the movie - that people are, at heart, conniving back-stabbing b*stards, and you're best off not trusting anyone. If so, this movie did its job superbly.",Null,0,0,30 July 2000
Good Will Hunting," Not bad...
","In general, this movie is very good.  Boston (and Cambridge) are faithfully rendered; this movie brings across the feel of these places very well. The acting was pretty good, and the dialogue was great.  I only have one complaint about this movie, and it's a big one: this movie is very predictable.  I don't think there was a single plot point that didn't telegraph itself a good half hour ahead of time.  The plot has as many twists and turns as the highway between Fort Worth and Dallas.  But if you don't mind predictability, you'll probably like this movie a lot.Kudos on a minor point.  Being a kind of amateur linguist, and a native of Boston's northern suburbs, I've often noticed how badly movies and television shows misrepresent the distinctive Boston accent.  Well, this movie got it right for the most part.  My compliments to the dialect coach. (Robert Easton didn't have anything to do with this, did he?)",Null,1,3,4 June 1999
The Evil Dead," The genius of Sam Raimi!
","I picked this up because it had Sam Raimi's name on it; 'Darkman' had been one of the funniest movies I'd ever seen.  With 'Evil Dead', I was not disappointed.This was simultaneously as funny as 'Darkman', as scary as 'Countess Dracula' and as gruesome as 'The Fly' (David Cronenberg version).  And in true Sam Raimi style, it was totally over the top!  The first time in my memory that I screamed, winced and laughed at the same time.  Justifiably considered a classic.",Null,0,1,19 February 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," A difficult movie
","In this age of technologically advanced films with jaw-dropping special effects and ennervatingly simple-minded plots, characters and dialogue, this film will seem difficult.  It's definitely not for casual leave-your-brain-at-home viewing.First there is the dialogue, or lack thereof.  There is no talking at all for the first half hour of the film, and long stretches thereafter where no one says anything.  This can be alienating to modern viewers who are used to vapid actors inanely flapping their mouths and spewing forth loads of verbal diarrhea.  Second, the film moves slowly, often very slowly.  Again, disconcerting to people not accustomed to exercising their attention spans. Third, the plot is inscrutable, often requiring the viewer to think fairly hard about what is going on.  'Nuff said about that.The special effects, especially the photographic effects, are stunning, even after thirty-one years.  I suspect, though, that time and its attendant advances in technology have dulled the visual effect a bit.Yes, this movie requires a lot of effort from the viewer.  But one suspects that it's well worth the effort.",Null,2,3,26 June 1999
A Clockwork Orange," A philosophical film
","At first glance, this film may seem like a sick deranged piece of trash shamelessly designed to appeal to our most prurient tastes.  Indeed, one of the most disturbing things about this film is that since the viewer is looking through Alex's eyes, there is sometimes a tendency for the viewer to relish the violence as much as Alex does - to laugh along with him as he commits his mayhem. (Yikes!)Two questions come out of this: Why is Alex made as repulsive as he is? And why is the violence portrayed in such a shockingly graphic manner?  (In the book, Alex is loathsome enough, but the brutality is cloaked somewhat in the 'nadsat' or teen language, based largely on Slavic roots, that Alex uses to tell his story.)  The answer to both of these questions is, I think, that Kubrick (and Burgess) wanted to make the point that no one deserves the inhuman conditioning that Alex went through - not even the cruelest most bestial slime (like Alex).  Thus, despite the shocking sensationalistic sex and violence, it can honestly be said that this film is... a philosophical work.",Null,0,0,6 June 1999
The Fly," YECCHH!!
","Ugh!  My dinner almost came up several times as I watched this movie!  No kidding, this movie is sick, disgusting, and totally gross!In other words, I loved it!!!  See this movie!  You won't be sorry!  (Just don't have a big meal before you watch it...)",Null,0,2,10 June 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," Slightly overrated, but only slightly
","I love this movie.  I did get a bit sick of it a few years ago when it played on just about every channel at just about every hour just about every day from Thanksgiving to Christmas.  But I never quite got to the point where I hated the movie.This movie, like a lot of Frank Capra's, is sometimes thought of as sentimental almost to the point of schmaltz.  It is true that a first glance this seems like a 'feel-good movie' to use the present-day parlance.  But, again like a lot of Capra's movies, it has a dark side lurking under its sunny exterior.  It's usually not patently obvious, but rather subtle.  In this case, James Stewart's dark hard-edged side is most notably seen in the scene where he goes home and abuses his family before going out to get plastered.  It's only a small part of the movie, but it's there, nicely complementing the sweet, nice, aw-shucks good-guy character he portrays throughout the rest of the movie.  It also shows what an actor of range Stewart was.",Null,0,2,31 July 1999
Army of Darkness," Sam Raimi's Three Stooges fixation in full flower!
","Of the three 'Evil Dead' movies,this one is the silliest, the funniest and the most enjoyable overall.  Throwing aside any pretext of making a horror movie, Mr. Raimi and company pull out every Three Stooges gag they can think of and put them into an evil-spirits-menace-medieval-England millieu. Leading man Bruce Campbell hams it up like never before.This movie also has the greatest number of fighting skeletons outside a Ray Harryhausen movie.",Null,1,1,15 October 2000
Kingpin," Side-splittingly disgusting
","Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is easily one of the most tasteless, disgusting, disturbing, disheartening, wretched, mean-spirited, nauseating, sickening, unsavory, base, gross, crude, rude, offensive lowlife movies I've ever seen.  It's also funny as hell.",Null,0,1,15 February 2001
Paths of Glory," A great film, but hard to watch
","This was an excellent film, but watching it can be a frustrating experience. Not because of any defect on the film, but because of the story.  Not that it's badly written, but that the story itself is frustrating.  It's hard to describe in detail without spoiling the film, but I will say that there is a travesty of justice portrayed here.  The most frustrating thing is that the sort of thing described in this film really did happen.  Why the generals of World War I (pick your country, they all had there share of crazy generals) weren't tried as war criminals for what they did to their own men is beyond me.So I can't in good conscience recommend this film for you if you're depressed or in a sour mood.  But otherwise, this movie is definitely worth watching.",Null,0,1,30 October 1999
The Wizard of Oz," Starring vehicle for Margaret Hamilton
","There's almost no point in writing about this movie, since it is so familiar.  Like almost everyone else in the known universe, I saw this movie about 77 times as a child, and was terrified by the winged monkeys.  I also noticed the surfeit of Boston-born actors, complete with Boston accents (notably, Ray Bolger and Jack Haley).  And when I grew up, I actually tried watching this movie with the sound turned down and Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' playing on the stereo.  (Don't bother, by the way; it's no big deal.)But what I remember today is the performance of that beloved character actress, Margaret Hamilton, as the Wicked Witch of the West, a role with which she would be identified for the rest of her days.  This is perhaps unfortunate, as it overshadowed a notable career in which she played prudish spinsters, nosy neighbors, gossipy biddies, and the like.  She was to W. C. Fields what Margaret Dumont was to the Marx Brothers.  In later years, she became famous (and much beloved) as a small-town innkeeper named Cora in a series of Maxwell House Coffee commercials.I hope it's not too indecent to admit this, but I had something of a crush on her when I was younger.  The old-fashioned clothes, the tight, disapproving face, the whole schoolmarm gestalt - I don't know, it just did something for me.  As you can imagine, when I have occasion to share this opinion with my friends, looks of stark terror flash across their faces as they back away from me, ever so slowly.I guess there's just no accounting for taste.",Null,0,0,10 May 2001
