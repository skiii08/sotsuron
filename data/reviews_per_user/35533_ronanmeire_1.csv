War Dogs," Based on real story? I wish my life was so daringly exciting!
","The movie is classified as a crime/ drama film but one knows it will have a comical aspect when Jonah Hill is involved. He is the anti-villain: at any opportunity, he (Efraim) endeavours to illude the audience into believing he is the virtuous character. Nevertheless, Miles Teller (David) plays a very strong anti-hero. He is innocent and begins to get unduly caught in the crossfire of an international arms dealing stratagem, albeit one could argue he does so himself and the repercussions are as a direct result of his childish behaviour. On the whole, this movie - like many other contemporary crime films - would lose a star or two in its rating had it not contained such wondrous actors. Hill and Teller are the perfect tag-team, but their split by the end of the movie reminds me of a phrase I coined a long time ago: 'He (Efraim) is a time bomb: tick, tick, ticking. And I (David) have no intention of being around for the boom.'",9,15,23,3 September 2016
