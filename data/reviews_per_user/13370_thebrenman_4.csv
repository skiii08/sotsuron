Lucky Number Slevin," Best Thriller of All Time
","Every movie that is unpredictable, has an excellent script. Lucky Number Sleven brings this to a whole new level. This movie is definitely not what it seems, and that is what makes the movie come to life. It is the perfect balance of plot, great actors, and a great soundtrack.Lucy Number Sleven is one of those movies, that makes you believe one thing, then has an unexpected turn. This happened multiple times in the movie. I thought of one thing, and then in the next five minutes, I was incorrect. This concept is likely what made the movie such a success.Starring Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, Morgan Freeman, and Sir Ben Kingsley, Lucy Number Sleven has the best cast any thriller could have. Josh Hartnett is already known for horror films(Halloween H20) and action/war thrillers(Black Hawk Down). Cast him with Bruce Willis(The Fifth Element) and Morgan Freeman(Se7en), and the movies becomes fantastic.The soundtrack for the movie was also amazing. At first, Kansas City Shuffle didn't seem to fit, but after watching the film, the song put the film together. All the songs were excellent.Lucy Number Sleven will remain my favorite thriller of all time, for either most of my life, or for my entire life.",10,3,6,28 December 2011
The Bourne Identity," Excellent Thriller
","The Bourne Identity is the beginning of a series of movies that should set the bar for all thriller to come.It has a more than decent plot about an Agent's Experience in the CIA. Its action scenes are also excellent and are not too unrealistic. The romance is also proficient, and is kept to a minimum(I personally don't see that often in thrillers), so it keeps me more engaged in the film.The Cast and soundtrack are beyond excellence. At first glance(post Good Will Hunting), Matt Damon doesn't seen like a person that is suitable to play Jason Bourne, but proved us wrong. Now, I can't watch a Bourne movie without him. The soundtrack was made by John Powell which did a good job. Its no Hans Zimmer, but it is better than most other thrillers.Overall, this movie was extremely good. I highly recommend it.",10,6,6,14 July 2012
Pearl Harbor," 10 out of 10; Perfect
","This World War II Epic was a fantastic mix of romance, drama, and disaster. Highly criticized for all of that, the movie is highly underrated.One thing that people say is, 'This is just a copy of Titanic'. Well if they haven't noticed, this isn't about one ship. This is about dozens of ships, planes, and people fighting against an invading enemy. Titanic was excellent, but this movie was nothing like it(besides the romance).Another thing that people complain about is its historical inaccuracy. Those people have to know that to make a historical moment into a drama film, you must adjust some things. Plus, if you add in everything that was important, as well as all historical moments, the length of the film can be higher than it already is.The last criticism is, that this movie was too long. Three hours and ten minutes is not long! If you are fine watching Titanic, you should be perfectly fine watching Pearl Harbor. There is absolutely no reason to complain about its length if it tells the story very well.The actors/actresses in the movie made it come alive! Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett are all fantastic actors. The supporting cast was also excellent and recognizable. Such as Cuba Gooding Jr.(Snow Dogs), Dan Aykroyd(Ghostbusters), and Alec Baldwin(Beetlejuice). Overall, the movie was highly underrated, and 10 out of 10 stars was not enough.",10,1,4,14 December 2011
The Dark Knight," Excellent Action Thriller
","The Dark Knight was a marvelous film. It shows us what a city might be like with potentially 'unstoppable' criminals and corrupt police officers.My favorite content that the movie had was showing us what can really happen. Corruption has taken over GPD, and Gothem is becoming a horrible city. Some of the criminal tactics are just horrific. A world where the police have 'no power' can scare the bejeezus out of anyone.The cast and soundtrack were also excellent. My favorites were Morgan Freeman(Lucky # Slevin) and Aaron Eckhart(The Black Dahlia). Christain Bale was also excellent in the film. The soundtracks were terrific. Hans Zimmer(Pearl Harbor Soundtrack) made the movie come to life. Everyone knows that a movie is not a true movie without an excellent soundtrack, and The Dark Knight truly proves that point. Imagine the movie 'Titanic' without the music. It would not be as good. Same thing applies for any movie.The movie was an excellent action thriller. 10 out of 10 stars is not enough!!!",10,5,9,17 January 2012
