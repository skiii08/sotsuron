The Blair Witch Project," Sleepless nights ahead for those who dare to enter...
","If fear makes us feel alive, then there are three missing somewhere in the hills of Maryland that would rather it killed them first.  And you may too after signing on to the beautifully suspenseful and spine-tingling 'Blair Witch Project.'  The horror that takes place in front of the cameras in this 'documentary' as its three-member crew becomes lost, hungry, hysterical and hunted will stay with you long after their last camera stops filming. Forget that this didn't actually happen, though that will be a true challenge.  What will really haunt you is that you can't convince yourself it COULDN'T happen.  Even in a world connected by computers and telecommunications, with nary an undiscovered piece of land to get lost in, we're still fascinated with strange phenomenon like witchcraft or the Bermuda Triangle.  We don't necessarily believe in them, but we also don't venture in by ourselves to discover their truths, either.  At least not like the film makers did here.  Their end, though fictional, is our 'why.'  I know it's mine.",10,1,2,22 June 1999
