The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Dawn Part 1 is the best one so far!
","BREAKING DAWN IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE IN THE SAGA YET. Bill Condon is a GENIUS! I was able to watch the movie on Monday 14th at the Black Carpet World Premiere in Los Angeles. Now let me tell you that watching the movie amongst 7000+ in attendance is a complete adrenaline rush. You could feel everyone emotions while the movie was playing plus knowing that the stars and Stephenie Meyer were in attendance and could hear our cheers just felt good. Having one tissue was not enough for the complete movie to wipe my tears of happiness. I know now when I go see it tonight once again, to take a box of tissues with me. Breaking Dawn Part 1 is one of the few movies I've watch throughout the years that I can say is just like the book. There is not one moment or scene I would take out or change. Now that I've seen the movie I'm glad they did break it up into two parts because I can't see it being done any other way after seeing the movie Monday. All the favorite elements from the book are in the movie, pus some new elements that work perfectly with what we know from the books too. I'm not going to describe the story since we pretty much have all read the book and know what happens. I won't spoil anything either since it will be worth the wait just a few more hours to see it tonight or tomorrow. How they end Part 1 is how I always expected they would. Even though I expected it , it was still incredible to watch it on the big screen. Jacob's imprinting will win you over if you haven't been on Team Jacob ever. Taylor killed it with the scene. Kristen was the one character throughout the movie that impressed me the most. I haven't been her number one fan but after her representation of Bella in Breaking Dawn, I'm am a FAN! Kristen does a phenomenal job with her part. You feel all her emotions throughout the movie. Robert as Edward continues to great also. Like I mention this movie is by far the best of all of them, I can't even imagine what part 2 will bring. What did I enjoy the best from the whole movie? This is the one that felt the most realistic. What do I mean by that. Well the characters interaction with one another. Bella and Edward show a side that we haven't seen before, its like watching yourself with your husband or boyfriend. Its that playfulness that couples share. Even the fighting between then was so realistic, it didn't feel like a script. I honestly could gush all day about how Epic Breaking Dawn Part 1 is. I'm so excited to go again tonight with my mom and live through the wedding and honeymoon once again. Tomorrow I can't wait to read all the comments of those that went tonight to see it.",10,20,57,17 November 2011
