The Blair Witch Project," They will believe it
","Humorous how people can be totally unaware of things happening around them, isn't it? This film came out six years ago and I have just finished watching it now; due to the fact that I wasn't even aware it existed until we discussed the success of the film (Capital wise) in film studies. I actually TiVo'ed the movie over Halloween weekend, and I'll tell you now I'm damn glad I did.This movie had my heart racing! I am sure part of that had to do with the fact that I had no idea that this was a fake film; as in, it wasn't really a documentary. The directors of this film had me fooled the whole time, I had no idea this film was set-up none at all. The acting, the story, the sense of it all being reality was so perfect I still wonder if 'The Blair Which' is an actual tale. The only complaint I have is that at times it seems like portions of the film are not needed, but after seeing it I realize it was purposely put there, so it played its purpose out well. I would seriously recommend this film to someone  but better yet I think YOU should watch this film alone than get your friends/relatives to believe its true  trust me, they will believe it! Plus; if they don't tell them to check out the website (http://www.BlairWhich.com) - it plays along with the whole 'story' :)",10,1,3,3 November 2005
