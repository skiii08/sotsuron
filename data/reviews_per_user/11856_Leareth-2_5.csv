Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," WONDERFUL! You can't beat a legend . . .
","If this doesn't sink the 'Titanic', then nothing will.This movie doesn't need to affect in the way a movie such as 'Schindler's List' does, it is for us to enjoy, forget the real world for two hours and relive the magic of Star Wars. It is impossible that 'the Phantom Menace' will outshine the original trilogy, but it will rise to sit in a place beside it.Okay, about the main criticisms:Plot - Some say it's way too weak - but WAIT, don't forget there are still TWO MORE to come that will develop the plot further. The Star Wars series is actually one huge movie, you can't say the plot was crap if you haven't seen the whole picture.Acting - Come on, they were great! Neeson was perfect as the elder Jedi Master, who might not abide by the rules but still has his own morals. Mcgregor did a wonderful job of living up to Alec Guiness's character, with the voice and manner. Portman was suitably majestic and dignified, but not overbearing, while Jake Lloyd was very good for someone so young having to play such a big role. As for Jar Jar, he's no Chewie, but taken as himself, he's quite good. Yes, Darth Maul could be a more major character, and he did not have to die, but he made a great impression for a guy who falls into a pit after saying two lines.Special FX - No words can express the wonder and amazement at the technology and skill. Lucas has created such a real universe in his mind, and finally he has the means to show the rest of us in all its detail.Music - With John Williams as the composer? No criticisms needed, just a hell of a lot of praise. 'Duel of the Fates' is a masterpiece!Script - Hey, it kept in style of the original three. Dashes of humour, some moralistic insights - it was good!Okay, so some things weren't as good as they could be. So Jar Jar talked too much. SO Darth Maul died too soon. So the midi-chlorin thing is a bit hokey.Who cares?(Don't forget, the original trilogy got some pretty harsh reviews when they were first released. I'm sure no critic today would admit to writing such articles about Star Wars. Who says it won't be the same for 'the Phantom Menace'?)There's heaps more, but I have to say that 'The Phantom Menace' just blows you away. SW fan or not, you will be amazed at the skill and flair of George Lucas. He has created this universe for all of us to enjoy, and as for those critics? Come on, it's STAR WARS. What else do you want?Just sit back, relax, and enjoy it as George Lucas takes you to a long time ago to a galaxy far, far away . . .",10,0,0,22 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," 'amounts of boredom....punctuated by moments of sheer terror.'
","A quote from a book easily comes to mind.... 'amounts of boredom....punctuated by moments of sheer terror.' (Star Wars: Rogue Squadron by Michael A. Stackpole)Don't get me wrong - the opening was an eye-opener and absolutely stunning and Tom Hanks was brilliant. But the parts in between the battles, like the scene when the team is resting in the church was boring. And personally, I don't think that military brass would concern themselves with one soldier out of millions who were dying in the most brutal war in history. They would be more concerned with trying to win the war.",Null,0,0,16 January 1999
A Bug's Life," 'You're PERFECT!!!'
",You know how funny this is?? I couldn't stop laughing! Disney wins again! The animation ruled (the camera going in and out of focus - wow!) especially the fire and the rain. The dialogue was hilarious and I think it is better than ANTZ - that was too dark (I had trouble making out the details sometimes) and there were less bugs. ABL has more variety in bugs and is brighter - in both screen and everything else. As for anyone who didn't stay for the credits - YOUR BIG LOSS.,Null,0,0,27 January 1999
Titanic," It's good, but not as good as everyone makes it out to be
","Everyone seems to be gushing on about Titanic, how it's the best movie ever made and so on, but I think, though it was good, it was definitely NOT the best movie of all time. There were some good points and some bad points, but what I thought was boring was the usual plot-line, guy and gal fall in love, one's rich, the other's poor and the family doesn't approve. The best thing I liked about this movie was the actual sinking (The first question I asked when I watched it was, 'When is the ship going to sink?') Leo DiCaprio didn't act to the highest of his ability, I thought he was better in Romeo and Juliet, and Kate Winslet was just marginally better. Cameron definitely is a great director and the photography and special effects were superb (Though I think spending 600 million to build your own mini version of the ship was a BIT expensive) I loved the music for the movie and I thought the soundtrack was  one of the best things worth buying.",Null,2,3,24 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Best movie of all time!
","I have seen this movie so many times, I know the script, I collect the books, ask me any question on Star Wars I could probably answer it.Star Wars is the best movie ever made. It has everything - plot, special effects, great script, endearing characters, one could go on and on about it. It has opened up an entire new universe in a galaxy far, far away. And the best thing about it, it can never end. As I had never seen Star Wars in the cinema it was absolutely AMAZING to see the famous opening line and the prologue disappearing into space. The best thing about it is that it is labelled Episode 4 - a promise of things to come. Of course everyone has seen this movie and its sequels (if not, you've been living in a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . . .) And everyone has to admit that its originality at least makes this one of the best movies of all time.",10,0,0,25 November 1998
