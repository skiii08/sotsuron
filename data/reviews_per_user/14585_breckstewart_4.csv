Blade Runner 2049," So Boring I Couldn't Finish it
","Well, there is no spoiler here at all. I couldn't bother to write them even if i wanted to because the story is so tedious and excruciating that I was not able to watch this to the end. So I read spoiler filled reviews instead to find out how this fiasco ends and well, no luck there either. My rating reflects the fact that there are some qualities to this film namely the effects and the beautiful cinematography but this is not a good movie in my opinion.As for the acting, I couldn't really tell because the narrative is so boring and uneventful for the most part that I was routinely fast forwarding through scenes hoping that the story would pick up but the steady pacing was slow and slower. The original is of course a masterpiece who survived the sand of times but this sequel is so below what I expected that I can only qualify this as a huge letdown.I can't totally say this is not worth watching especially for those who worship the original but be prepared to be swamped with concepts and bits of dialogue that want to be deep and thought provoking while personally, I found the whole thing trite and overly pedantic in an overly confused and overblown manner.But the most important aspect I couldn't get over is just how painful this was for me to watch. I never felt connected to the story nor cared for any of the characters but that might just be me. Draw your own conclusions and prove me wrong if need be but 3 stars is the only rating I could muster for this overly long and pretentious piece of fiction.",3,3,6,18 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Totally satisfied
","First, it is a huge deal for me to attend a movie house because frankly, I haven't been to 'the movies' on the big screen since The Matrix Revolutions which I loved and saw 4 times back in 2003. It takes something truly special to get me out of the house especially on opening weekend and I'm not exactly sure why but I felt instantly connected to this one character even more than all the others in the Avengers series.Forget about the feminist bashing trolls who are trying to destroy this important piece of art by deluging it with bad reviews tainted with political and moral stances questionable at best. But ironically, they are making the point even stronger for how well this incarnation of Captain Marvell has been rendered. The character had had many lives in the comics and I must say, they did an amazing job in portraying the Vers/Carol Danvers version.CM ties into a very broad and mesmerizing Marvel universe but somehow, Vers touched me even more than I ever thought possible. I enjoyed it to the point where I felt the urge to go back the next day even if the movie house experience can be painful to me with too many distractions, people talking, annoying ads and previews. Nothing beats watching at home with the remote at hand. But I didn't regret my decision and had an amazing time.I realize that giving it a 10 is extreme and one could argue that nothing deserves the perfect rating in this genre but when a movie satisfies me to this level, I feel compelled to let my opinion be known and I beg you to give it a fair chance and just enjoy the ride. The fun is real, the 90's music is pure bliss and well, Goose steals the movie cause there is nothing better than the proverbial cool cat.Now bring on Endgame already!",10,5,22,13 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Color Me Surprised
","I have to say fist, I barely tolerated The Force Awakens and really disliked The Last Jedi so with all these negative reviews floating around I was expecting to hate The Rise of Skywalker. But to my utter delight, I really enjoyed it to the point where it has become my second favorite next to Episode III Revenge of the Sith.The pacing was perfect and the story kept me engaged all throughout with a velocity that I found surprisingly effective. The acting was good and of course the special effects were flawless but with all the money spend on this thing I wouldn't expect anything less.This said, I can totally understand why many die hard fans might totally hate it. Several key plot points didn't quite make sense in connection with the 2 previous movies and it just dismissed many established facts of the whole saga in general. Not to give anything away but let's just say that this ending if it truly is the last Star Wars movie doesn't quite make sense considering everything that came before.Say what you will about George Lucas but he kept the story tight and precise with every detail deeply connected to the franchise as a whole. You might have not liked some of his choices but no one could dispute the fact that he cared about the story and made sure that everything fitted together like a giant puzzle.But somehow, even though George had no say in this whatsoever, I truly loved Rise of Skywalker to the point where a 9 rating was justified in my mind. I would recommend that you leave everything else behind and not try to connect the events of this movie too much with the previous 2 let alone all the others because it might become a tedious and frustrating experience.I think that this movie is best enjoyed when one just tries to forget everything that happened before and let yourself get immersed in the story. I guess it was easier for me to really enjoy this because I am not viscerally attached to the Star Wars universe in such a way that I can't forgive lapses in continuity.I truly enjoyed it and in spite of myself, I have to conclude that it is one of the best Star Wars I've ever seen. I won't even try to convince anyone else because it would be pointless since most fans have very definite ideas on what should happen in the Star Wars universe.
But for what it's worth, I think the force is strong with this one so color me satisfied.",9,3,14,15 March 2020
Flashdance," The Music and the Dancing is What Matters
","I was a teenager when I saw this movie and since I didn't go to a movie house very often in those days (even less now), of course the movie had an impact on me. But what I remember mostly from my perception back then was how great the music was and how the dancing was out of this world.This said, I hadn't seen it since then and I wanted to watch it again with an adult perspective to review things properly. It might be unfair to judge Flashdance with our modern eyes since as an audience we are so much more sophisticated being deluged with special effects and amazing technical achievements in movies then we all were in the 1980's.But even as a 15 year old and not knowing much of anything about editing or technical aspects of movie making, I remember that I instantly noticed that the dancing was not done by the same person. This is no big secret now and is even mentioned in the trivia here but Marine Jahan was the one who danced in most of the sequences that were supposed to be done by Jennifer Beals. I recall being startled at just how carelessly they had filmed Marine in medium shot with her face clearly visible in many segments inter cut with a few shots of Beals in close ups to maintain the illusion.I also remember an award show in those days where they finally exposed the truth that Marine Jahan was the dancing double and she even performed a dance routine that blew me away. I can just imagine how frustrating it must have been for her not even being credited here or anywhere else for her work. Her dancing is amazing and I don't know why they couldn't use someone who could act the scenes as well as dance but I guess we're talking about a different era.Today of course, they would find an actress who can dance or a dancer who can act and they do exist. This brings me back to the ultimate frustration I felt with this movie. Cynthia Rhodes has a small part as Tina Tech one of the dancers and I will never figure out why they didn't give her the lead part of Alex Owens. Not only was Rhodes gorgeous and an amazing dancer (her one big dancing scene is the highlight of the movie to me...) but she could also act. She deserved that part but I guess Beals had something that the producers preferred.I have to say that I was disappointed in Jennifer's performance. For some reason, I didn't connect with her portrayal and even though she is the lead, the fact that I keep seeing someone else's face every time Alex dances pulls me out of the story which by the way, isn't much at all. Nothing really happens and except for the dance scenes which are spectacular, nothing else attracted my attention.Which brings me to my final point. This is I think one of the very first movies that was truly made successful by the soundtrack. The music is of course the main star of this movie and on that front, they struck gold. Even today, those songs are so powerful that they uplift the so-so movie into the stratosphere.So a 6 star rating felt fair because even though this is by means a great movie and should mostly be viewed as a collection of music videos, the dancing and the music makes it an enjoyable depiction of an era gone by and I for one can respect the fact that this became such a monster hit that it defined a whole generation.",6,1,1,10 April 2019
