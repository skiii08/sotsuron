The Blair Witch Project," hyped horror film, not scary
","Very disappointed...not scary at all.  Hype made it popular, not storyline. No special effects, nothing fearful.  Good story concept though.  They could have done so much more with this film.  Good characters.  Actors did a good job.",2,0,1,22 August 1999
