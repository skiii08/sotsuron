Hereditary," This is a scary film
","This is not a horror film like these with zombies and post apocalyptic situations, or aliens and unknown creatures, there is only build up tension and good cinematography. It reminds me somehow the books of Lovecraft. 
Unfortunately, by the end of the story a lot of irrational things begin to happen , it seems that there is a different film after that point",7,0,2,25 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," What a waste of time
","This film gives nothing, I give it a 5 just for the effects and creatures",5,4,11,21 March 2020
A Quiet Place," Nope. Not logical and predictable
","I didn't like this one. The idea is original but this is all.
From the start the script is full of not logical details. It is not possible for any living thing to rely only at the sence of hearing. This assumed, it is not possible to be unable to understand wich sounds come from other living things. 
As for the plot, I was sure about the ending from the middle of the film, I give a 5, just because I stayied till the end",5,3,5,16 April 2018
