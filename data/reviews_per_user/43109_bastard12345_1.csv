Requiem for a Dream," A movie about the pleasure, struggles, and consequences one will face when becoming an addict.
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon wayans and Ellen Burstyn are excellent and believable and make this movie very realistic. This story shows the pleasure, the fun and the consequence of taking hard drugs. It shows how addicts/ junkies will feel like when taking the drugs, how they will feel when they are sober, and the disgusting and humiliating things they will do to get more drugs. The plot is about Harry, (Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Connelly) and his friend Tyrone's (wayans) Life as they live it day by day taking hit after hit. While Harry's mother Sara (Burstyn) tries to overcome her addiction to diet pills. There are a lot of disturbing scenes in this movie so I don't recommend this movie to young viewers. The scenes include a lot of drug use, nudity, hardcore sex scenes, some violence, and coarse language. As much as this movie is inappropriate for anyone under 18 it is the truth of what these addicts/ Junkies face every day and can be very educational. Hope this helps",10,0,1,17 June 2005
