War Dogs," The Albanian woman asking for her missing husband spoke in Romanian!!
","I liked this movie. Kept me entertained. It had a good story line, humour and great actors!
I took two stars though as I was disappointed to see that when one of the main characters was in Albania, there was a woman that spoke in Romanian AND as a Romanian, made me wonder if Romanian language is supposed to be considered the language that is spoken in Albania..??!!!
I hope that the explanation could also be that the missing Albanian man was just married to a Romanian.. as otherwise: in Albania, people speak Albanian and in Romania people speak Romanian. I know! I'm Romanian!
Albania and Romania are two very different countries!",8,0,0,25 January 2019
