The Ring," Scary and Strange
","If you're like me and are scared by thrillers other than slasher-movies than this one's for you. Scariest movie based around the television since Poltergeist. The movie left some questions unanswered but I guess that helps set up a sequel which I see is coming out Spring of 2005. There's a lot of detail to the story-line so it might help to watch a couple of times to follow every detail. The extra footage on the DVD was confusing to watch right after the movie, think of it as deleted scenes and alternate endings. The characters are likable. The scenery is fun. There's a twist towards the end of the movie that wasn't expected. The effects are good. Good movie to watch with the lights out, even though I did not!",7,1,2,10 November 2004
