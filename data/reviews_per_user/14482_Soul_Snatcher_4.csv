Hereditary," Don't watch it alone at midnight. I'm serious.
","Being an avid horror fan, this has to be the scariest movie I've seen. Midway during the movie, me and my friend paused it and wondered if we should stop watching because the terror, tension and build up was psychologically horrifying for both of us at approximately 11.30 pm. Toni was out of this world with that performance and everything around was played so well into perfection. I believe ending could've been more terrifying but hey we don't wanna soil our pants, do we? This is a horror masterpiece for the genre and the fans equally.",9,1,2,14 February 2020
Us," Good concept but botched execution
",The idea behind the movie was great but screenplay and character development was a farce. This is an perfect example of quality material not executed with excellence. Lack of uniformity in events execution compared to similar counterparts was evident. Winston Duke was hilarious and would love to see him comedies more. Peele did well with Get Out but this was far from good in terms of execution despite quality concept. Get some quality screenwriters but don't add weird comedies which disturb the tense constant atmosphere.,1,0,2,1 June 2019
Midsommar," A slow-burn into disappointment
","The acting was quality but the storyline was very predictable and superfluous. Expectations were high due to Ari's last movie but this fell way off the mark. The customs of Harga were too polished and felt vapid just for the sake of movie. The 'rabbit' in the hat was too evident and hence there was less to none tension in the movie. After 1 hour mark, the movie fails to hold up and sinks rapidly into bland, forced and obvious depths. Ari should definitely try more hardcore tense horror like hereditary which hr is apparently master at unlike pretentious sub-genre 'exploration'.",4,3,10,21 January 2020
Parasite," It's not as good as the ratings make it out to be
","It has good start which quickly wraps you in and you get curious all along but once they're set in the plot, the movie dies down quickly until the 'last event'. The last event wasn't too disastrous except Mr. Kim's action. The naivety was tremendous from the housewife and tries too hard to sell. For the acting, it was top notch from everyone involved. The film is decent but don't go in with too much expectations as it's now nominated for oscars as well.",2,11,41,14 January 2020
