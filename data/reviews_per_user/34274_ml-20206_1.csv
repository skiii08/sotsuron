First Man," Perfection
","Anyone who finds this movie boring should stick to 'shoot em up' movies.First Man was perfection.We weren't actually planning on seeing this at the movies and ended up watching it by accident. But very glad we did as it was an amazing piece of true cinema art.Very interesting watching this 50 years later in a time when we are just on the cusp of 'space tourism' in that it shows the gritty true engineering nature of space flight. I came across this review - perfectly accurate.'First Man' is so immersive in its glitchy, hurtling, melting-metal authenticity that it makes a space drama like 'Apollo 13' look like a puppet show.",10,15,36,13 October 2018
