The Blair Witch Project," Too much use of the 'F' word and not enough frights!
","From the reviews and all the hype, I was expecting this to be a really frightening film, but was disappointed to find it was not scary at all. The most shocking thing about the film was how much the 'F' word was used.I saw this on DVD, the special edition, and found that the 'Curse of the Blair Witch' documentary was more entertaining.",5,0,2,31 October 1999
