The Sound of Music," The Sound of Music
","The Sound of Music is a favorite childhood movie, teenage movie, young adult movie, and adult movie. It was basically my reference for love throughout my life. It's how I made sure I was in love at 23 and then thereafter, was the beginning of a huge database of potential love songs that I made up for me and my new-found love ever after life. I learnt at the young age of 9 that love could be that exciting, I even learnt all the metaphors and became from there a young lady in waiting I should say except that I would have to consider it a shoulder but I can't. I feel that this movie is a good reference. One with all the details you would need t move on with life and love, one that you could reference later in case you were confused and then you can start all over again.",10,2,8,19 June 2015
The Aviator," The Aviator
","Aviator is a piece of artwork that took just as long to make as it took Howard Hughes to build a proper flying airplane; it takes a very penetrating look at the life of an overwhelmingly wealthy person with an idea that required more than attention but attention. The interpretation of his life as depicted by Leonardo DiCaprio needed the advice of Martin Scorsese to fully show the personality but it worked well. Leonardo, the innocent soft faced, I thought would find it difficult to play the role but with definite manipulation from Scorsese, made it through as direct, indirect, attentive, withdrawn, there, not there, berserk, ridiculous, smart, witty, charming, quirky and quiet. This actor I felt gave up a thing that I would call 'baby' or 'young' for an actor and reached into adulthood but back to self. Very long - over 3 hours",7,0,0,12 June 2015
Gone Girl," Gone Girl
",A drama in the beginning became a thriller by reasoning. The best muse I felt was the setting which provided the inspiration for the switch. The best actor in the movie was Ben Affleck with best face - confused state of mind. The story-line really I felt catered to the well-informed because it changed. It's meant for those that anticipate watching the whole movie not just parts. It requires attention and attention to detail; thought provoking. It used a favorite quality of mine called 'thinking outside the box' with a retrospect to the innermost thoughts of a killer. The metaphor and plot formed in the folds of that relationship making this a unique book to movie thriller,8,16,22,8 June 2015
Good Will Hunting," Good Will Hunting
","The winner of Project Greenlight, 'Good Will Hunting' to me deserved to win every award that there was giving in 1997. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did an amazing job depicting the want to be good enough to move on with 'will' a metaphor established for the main character 'Will' as he journeys from his innermost want to a real goal in society. The story journeys with Will as he battles his own demons for a chance to express himself in smarts. The movie explores the differences in classes in society in Boston but really stood as a metaphor not just for that difference in society, but of gender, status and affiliation as well. Themes that came up were 'boys will be boys', 'I am the King of my own mansion', 'where there's 'will', there's a way' and 'dreams, they do come true'.",10,1,4,16 June 2015
The Departed," The Departed
","The Departed is one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen. Martin Scorsese choose well when he teamed Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg up against each other and the good and bad guys. The good cop that went bad, the good cop that went good, and the jerk in charge of it all, all showed up for work on this picture. The movie had me wondering but not most of the time and before I knew became sexy. It captured my attention throughout but even though I paid close attention, I felt like I missed the story. At one point, two points, three points, it broke my heart. Nothing like Shakespeare but it did share a story of reason against the unreasonable, and I think that's what won out.Reason - possibly good, not great!",10,0,1,12 June 2015
