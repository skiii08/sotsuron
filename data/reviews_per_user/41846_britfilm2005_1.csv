United 93," The single most important film of a generation
","Having only watched this film yesterday evening, I can confess to still feeling both numb and emotionally drained by the experience. September 11, as what is now become something of a clich√©, started out as a normal day. The pilots, cabin crew and passengers of the four aircraft, their families and friends; all woke that morning without any sense of how dramatically and cruelly their lives would either end or be completely destroyed in a single morning. (Spoiler ahead) Paul Greengrass has captured, in the film's 111 minutes, a brutal and overwhelmingly moving account of September 11 and in particular, the despicable violence inflicted, on United 93 and the fear of the aircraft's passengers and surviving cabin crew. I found myself, on a number of occasions, breaking down in tears; as the film draws you in to the fear, confusion and desperation of everyone involved. September 11, 2001 was the day that the world changed and it is important that a film, such as United 93, despite its controversial nature and violence; is viewed by everyone as it is important that the events of that day do not just become a snapshot of CNN images, lodged in one's memory.",10,4,9,13 June 2006
