Requiem for a Dream," Great movie
","Firstly I want to say a Great movie, I haven't seen such great stagecraft for years.. Amazing acting. You could feel everything that is shown on the movie, like it is for real. Secondly it is not the simple movie, because it's some kind of manual which perfectly fit on all the important stages( what is important firstly, secondly and etc.). It's not the simple Holiwood movie, a film director didn't play with such things as pop music, he shows the truth, not all those old and boring L.A. tags, he shows the real life as it is. Movies like this one makes Hollywood stronger in my eyes and I believe in people ones too.",10,0,1,20 November 2005
