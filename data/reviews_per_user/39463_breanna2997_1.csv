It," Easily a classic!
","Everyone else's reviews seem pretty irrelevant to me. Everyone's a critic and impressions are subjective, so you have to watch it for yourself to create your own opinion. If you have one review where somebody claims the movie wasn't enough like the book, and then another review where somebody states the movie was too 'perversive' for the audience it's 'aimed towards' (which actually doesn't make sense considering the movie is rated R so you have to be at least 17 to even get into the theater) then you have two totally different perspectives because clearly the person who left the second review has also never read the book. If you look at the movie as it's own entity; it's great. It doesn't have to be 'scary' to be a good horror movie. Is everyone forgetting about the Scream franchise entirely? The actors were amazing; really an awesome cast, and the teamwork is extremely admirable. i LOVE this movie!!",10,2,3,1 September 2019
