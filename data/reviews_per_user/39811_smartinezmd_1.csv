The Finest Hours," Out of respect for these men....
","If you read the history of this story and couple that with the quality of acting as well as the time and money that has gone into making this movie, it seems disrespectful that over 40,000 voters would give this picture less than 7 out of 10 stars rating. Excellent story and movie and acting. 10 stars as a means of correcting any previous disrespect.Both Casey Affleck and Chris Pine do a phenomenal job of acting. The harrowing scenes are breathtaking. A good piece of history to restore anyone's faith in humanity. Treat yourself to an important history lesson and good-old-fashioned entertainment.The greatest small boat rescue in history which happened in 1952....just over 64 years ago.",10,3,6,1 February 2017
