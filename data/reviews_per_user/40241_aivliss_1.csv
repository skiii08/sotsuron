Saturday Night Fever," Disappointing
","26 years after its release I watched this movie yesterday evening for the first time: what a disappointment! I simply don't understand the big success it had! I don't really see a story behind that, just nonsense.... I really enjoyed John Travolta in Grease, which was released a short time after that and which was one of my childhoods 'musts' but this.... no way!",4,3,9,22 June 2003
