Your Name.," Words can't describe how fantastic it is.
","Your Name, also known as Kimi no na wa, is an anime film is directed by Makoto Shinkai and it is based on the book written by Shinkai. It tells the story of a boy named Taki, a high school boy who lives in Tokyo who out of some bizarre miracle, begins switching bodies repeatedly with a high school girl named Mitsuha who lives out in the country. The two learn about one another through various hi- jinks and need to find a way to pair up and stop something from happening.The movie was English dubbed by Funimation and came to select theaters in North America for a week and I have been dying to see this after hearing about all the buzz regarding it, and I'm not going to lie, this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. So, how did I feel about the movie after seeing it? If you couldn't guess by the rating, I loved it!The movie was incredibly engaging and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The story is simply immersive, with many surprising twists and turns along the way that can really bring you into the experience. The mystery of the movie is an element that really drew me in, and it lead to me thinking of some questions that eventually got answered as the movie pressed on. The movie is very emotional with many scenes that will send you The interaction between our two leads Taki and Mitsuha is definitely strange to say the least, but in a good way, even if their interactions are awkward. I'm just going to leave the explanation regarding the story and characters off right here because it's hard for me not to review this particular film without talking about the film in-depth.The animation is fantastic to look at as well. The designs for the back grounds in particular really gave me a feel for what the city in the country looks like as well as what Tokyo looks like. The CGI does a surprisingly good job at blending in with the traditional animation. Even the movements of the characters look natural, as well as the environments. Even though the art style is no new anime art style, it still is a very well polished one. During one scene, the art style goes through a major change that would last for a few minutes and personally I loved the change. I loved the vocal songs that were featured in the movie. As someone who isn't a fan of modern music, I found them quite refreshing, even if they are just English dubbed.Your Name is simply a fantastic movie experience regardless of whether you're an anime fan or not. It's really easy to see why it gained critical acclaim in Japan and multiple awards. The story is incredibly gripping and our two lead characters are both very interesting and very likable. The animation is beautiful from start to finish and the vocal songs felt refreshing. I'll be honest, it was very hard to find a legitimate flaw with the movie. However, if I do have one legitimate criticism towards the film, it's that the film starts off pretty slowly and is not as engaging as it is later on. However, I can afford to forget about that since it didn't bother me that much. While it's in theaters for a limited amount of time, go see it. This film has to be seen to be believed.If I could make a recommendation however, I do think the movie is more suitable to older audiences in spite of the PG rating. I wouldn't recommend the movie to those under the age of 10 due to some suggestive themes that might not be appropriate for audiences under that age. If you do plan to bring kids under the age limit, make sure to keep an eye out for them.",10,9,14,8 April 2017
It," It manages to be very terrifying yet hold some light moments to balance out the creepy factor.
","It is a movie about a mysterious clown who is known for hunting and kidnapping children. Throughout the summer, multiple kids begin to go missing in action and nobody in the city seems to have any idea why. A group of kids calling themselves the 'losers' decide to take a stand and attempt to search for said clown.The movie's central theme appears to revolve around fear, particularly fears of children. As the movie progresses, we learn about the characters' fears from how they act, interact with one another and how it affects their daily lives. Pennywise, the clown, plays around with and uses their fears to lure out the children and the way it is executed is very well done. I found the execution so well done that it even frightened me. It does play around with jumpscares, which some may see as an issue, but for me, I didn't mind the occasional ones because there was more of a theme to the movie than just a random scene here and there. Like I said, it's more about the fears that each child has and how they're exploited.The movie also establishes a lighter tone through various parts which is used to help the characters grow and develop. These moments help bring out some good humor that had me and the audience in my theater laughing.The movie also had some great casting choices. The actors for the kids did a very good job at just being normal kids. They didn't fall into that trope of the kids being absolutely nutty considering that they were older. Each of the actors was spot-on, I couldn't think of a bad performance in this entire film. I especially loved Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. He was menacing and absolutely terrifying and it couldn't have been that way if it wasn't for his acting. Skarsgard does a fantastic job portraying Pennywise in an intimidating fashion.Overall, It is a terrifying flick with an engaging story, memorable characters and fantastic acting and it is one of my favorite films of the year.10/10",10,5,11,11 September 2017
Hereditary," Unsettlingly gripping, Hereditary is a perfect example of a horror movie done right.
","It's not the abrupt scares that should creep the audience out, but rather the concepts of the movie that should scare the audience. Hereditary does this perfectly. After a family's grandmother dies, the family, especially the mother begins to deal with many unsettling occurrences that may or may not be linked to said grandmother's death.This is a very investing horror drama movie. It uses both genres really well, with the first half acting as the drama portion and the second half acting as the horror portion with sprinkles of horror elements in the beginning. It acts as slow build up to the movie's ending, and it's not quite prominent until the final fifteen minutes since it uses show, don't tell rather than mountains of exposition. The majority of the movie uses show don't tell very effectively in general. There are many quiet scenes that bring up many mysteries such as a light coming from the treehouse, which are very thought provoking.In the beginning, the grandmother was stated to be very secretive and often kept things hidden from even her own daughter. This puts her in a suspicious light when we gradually find out about some of the actions that her family has been put through. I gotta admit, it's both interesting and unsettling as to how they unravel the mystery.And yes this movie was unsettling, especially during the third act. I was on the edge by the final 30 minutes and was quite terrified by the actions performed against the family. Again, it's the concepts portrayed in the movie that scare me. There were little to no cheesy jumpscares; if the movie was filled with jumpscares, it'd get old, but thankfully there were none. There were moments where I was really uncomfortable in the theater because of what was happening. The acting was also really well done, especially from Alex Wolff, who plays the teenage son. As the main character, he was incredible. He was not just convincing in this role, but it felt like he lived and breathed the role as he ended up being the one who suffered the most throughout the movie.I overall loved Hereditary, even though it's not something I see myself watching again. I loved the acting, the suspense, the shift in mood and the unsettling vibe of the movie. This movie, I think will please any true horror enthusiast.10/10",10,15,30,15 June 2018
Detroit," Great retelling of a dramatic event, but it drags.
","Detroit is a movie that is based around the events of the Algiers Motel Incident during the African American rebellion. During that incident, a group of African American males and two white females are taken in as victims who threatened police officers at the Algiers Motel. When the incident unfolds, the men and women involved would have their lives completely changed.For what this movie is, it's fine. It's executed well enough even if it isn't completely historically accurate. It does have its intense moments, mainly towards the second act and the movie is very well acted. Algee Smith does a fantastic job with his character, Larry especially. Larry, admittedly is the main highlight of the movie for me. He is able to show so much through just his facial expressions and gestures, and I really admire Smith for executing that so well. There is a lot of political talk throughout this narrative. Some viewers may not understand all of it.Either way, my main issue with the movie is that it feels like it drags on for too long. This movie is almost two and a half hours long, and I feel like the running time could've been reduced by about 15 minutes. I mean, the majority of the first act does do a good job at setting up the catalyst of the plot, but since this movie is about Detroit's Algiers Motel Incident rather than simply the fall of Detroit itself, I feel like there's a good chunk in the beginning that could've been taken out.Even though Detroit feels like it drags on for too long, it's still a well acted and well written telling of a tragic event that took place in the city of Detroit. Sure, it could've been better, but it's at least a decent movie.7/10",7,26,47,5 August 2017
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper's directorial debut is a shining star.
","A Star is Born stars Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, who also directed it. This is the third remake of the original 1930s movie of the same name. It's about an alcoholic country singer who meets a young singer at a bar and eventually helps her find fame. As they fall in love, he has to deal with his alcoholism and his inner conflicts.I was interested in this movie because of the TIFF buzz, but I was also very skeptical since Lady Gaga was one of the stars and I was especially afraid her performance would be awful. In the end, I was surprised by how well-done this movie is. For his directorial debut, Cooper did a fantastic job. The characters are very believable and I had myself sympathizing with Cooper's character. His character is basically an alcoholic who needs to learn to deal with the responsibilities of being one, and he has layers that gives us a reason to sympathize with him. Lady Gaga's character is a rising star who is skeptical of him, yet finds joy being around him.I find the strongest aspect of the movie to be the acting and the chemistry.
Lady Gaga really floored me with her acting on display. I thought she would be awful in this since this is her first movie, but she did a fantastic job with both her acting and singing. She is more than just convincing as an actress here, she feels like she's living and breathing her role. Bradley Cooper is also incredible as his character and it's probably my favorite performance of his. He especially gets emotional during one scene in the third act and by that point, I really immersed myself in his character for that reason. Cooper and Gaga's chemistry was also fantastic. I can't think of anything wrong with it, I really felt their connection.I do have a small issue with the pacing of the story in how it feels like it's too fast paced at times where things come and go too quickly sometimes. Either way, I found this movie really good and I really hope to see more directorial films from Bradley Cooper. To go from an actor to a director is a tough transition and I think he made a smashing debut.9/10",9,3,6,11 October 2018
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel may be the most average MCU film to date.
","Captain Marvel had a lot of pressure to live up to considering the fact that it's an MCU film, the first movie about a female superhero since Wonder Woman, and the fact that it's the origin story of a foreshadowed character that's set to appear in Endgame. Sadly, I feel as though this is the MCU as its most underwhelming.I don't think this film is a total atrocity like many of the other reviewers here, this isn't Fant4stic levels of terrible. Frankly, this movie has some good qualities to it. It's a well-shot, great-looking movie with lovely cinematography. Samuel L.. Jackson is entertaining as always as Nick Fury. He also befriends a cat, who manages to be unexpectedly useful, and might be my favorite aspect of this movie. I found the third act in particular to be the most exciting part of the entire film. Finally, like usual, the technical aspects of this movie were fantastic.As for my criticisms, for starters, there is a plot twist that occurs later on into the film that could've worked out. However if the viewer has watched a previous MCU film, there is a villain that makes a return that makes the twist feel incredibly predictable. It's a twist that doesn't really do it for me, and I can't imagine it working for many other people. My biggest problem with the movie however, is probably Captain Marvel herself. She's very bland as a character overall. While I don't think her performance as a whole was bad, Brie Larson showed very little emotion while she was on-screen. She had this blank, wooden stare throughout the entire film. Finally, I found her development as a superhero to be incredibly abrupt and forced.Captain Marvel is not a bad movie, it's just painfully average and not anywhere near the quality we would usually expect from the MCU. It's stylish and has its moments, but it overall felt lacking. Marvel Studios should've done better than this.5/10",5,5,8,22 March 2019
Us," Us is an ambitious, creepy and thought provoking follow-up to Get Out.
","Considering the fact that Jordan Peele's Get Out was up for several award nominations, people would naturally be expecting a lot from him and his future projects. Case in point, we have Us, which stars Lupita Nyong'o as the lead character of the film as she and her family are on vacation. On the night in, however, they encounter some uncanny doppelgangers that are out to kill them.This is a risky, ambitious and horrifying film, that is really well-crafted. There were so many moments throughout this film where I was left frightened or terrified for the main characters. This film drives away from a lot of the normal horror conventions that could've made it a mediocre horror film, like how the characters end up making very clever decisions, which that in it of itself gives me respect.The film's third act in particular is, to me the most fascinating part of the film, as everything comes together in ways that a lot of people wouldn't expect. It's the type of third act that has gotten a lot of mixed reactions from audience members, and for good reason. I think it's meant to make the audience question its view on the big picture and everything they've seen during the first two acts. The closing scene especially highlights Peele's risk-taking with this projects, as it provides the audience with some insightful questions that just beg an answer. While the third act especially is great, some of the questions open up some plotholes, which slightly bring the movie down for me.If you want a vastly different slice of horror that's far out of the norm, and want to be challenged, I highly suggest checking out this movie, I definitely didn't regret seeing this.

Thor: Ragnarok," It's one heck of an adventure!
","Thor: Ragnarok is the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe movie that puts Thor in the spotlight for the third time. This movie is about the rerise of Hela, Thor and Loki's lost sister who rises after being imprisoned for years by their father Odin as she looks to destroy Asgard. While being sent to an unknown world by her, the brothers discover the whereabouts of the Hulk.When I first saw the trailer for this movie I wanted to be realistic with what the final product could have been. I originally thought this movie was going to be just average like the two previous Thor films. Going in, I was wrong. This movie essentially answers many different questions in the span of two hours. Such questions include how Thor would be able to fight if he didn't have his hammer and the aforementioned whereabouts of the Hulk. Speaking of which, the Hulk feels like he has a more of a personality compared to how he usually is. In the other Marvel films that I've seen him, he only really stuck out as a one note character who did nothing but get angry. In this film, he feels like more of a character and this is shown with the heart-to-heart conversation between him and Thor. The movie was also very well shot in terms of the cinematography and the fight scenes. The jokes, while there may be a few too many, really worked and I laughed at virtually all of them. Again, I did feel like the humor overstayed its welcome and was overwhelming at times, which is a little distracting, which brings the movie slightly down for me. Either way, I enjoyed the experience of watching Ragnarok a lot and I am really looking forward to Infinity War coming within the next five months.9/10",9,12,22,8 November 2017
Ready Player One," This movie speaks to the nerd in me despite the flaws that it has.
","Ready Player One is Spielberg's latest movie and (technically) his second movie of the year with his first being The Post. I've already reviewed the former, so let's tackle it.This movie takes place in a dystopian future where humanity has lost all hope in restoring the world. Most of the world's population has escaped to the OASIS, a virtual world where literally anything is possible. The creator of the virtual game had died years prior and has sent out a challenge to obtain three keys in order to be crowned the successor of him.As soon as the movie began to show off the OASIS, I immediately became invested. The visuals presented in the virtual world are simply stunning to look at. They play around with them quite often here, whether be with the integration of The Shining hotel or the race in the beginning. The movie delivers some very engaging action sequences. These include the racing sequence in the beginning and the large battle. As I've said, the visuals in the OASIS look very convincing and look like they actually belong in their own world. On the other hand, the dystopian future looks dystopian at first with Wade's hometown, but I feel like the movie lets go of that viewpoint once he leaves the city. Admittedly, the visuals in the real world feel bland, generally speaking. Wade's hometown looks nice, but everything outside it looks entirely generic.So Parzival, Wade's username, and his best friend Aech team up with some fellow gamers such as a Twitch streamer named Art3mis and two Japanese gunters who are willing to find the three keys on their own. Along the way, they find out about an organization known as IOI. One aspect of the movie I find intriguing and substantial is the commentary of online relationships. The five of them may establish a nice connection, but they haven't seen each other in the real world. They wouldn't know if they were really predators or just innocent people. The organization IOI is, I think, supposed to symbolize strangers on the internet who act as predators, and I find this both clever and relevant in this day and age.A problem that many people have with the movie is the pop culture references. The movie opens with Minecraft, there are several references to The Shining, there are classic song references and one of the characters works on an Iron Giant, and that's not scratching the surface for how many references there are. Some may see this as a bad thing because it may end up dating the movie. While this is most likely true, it really didn't bother me, since I am a bit of a movie nerd myself.My biggest problem with the movie happens to be the characters. While I find Wade/Parzival and Samantha/Art3mis to be the most developed characters, with their relationship growing overtime, all of the other characters are undeveloped, bland and plain forgettable. Even the villain feels forgettable with his reasoning for wanting the keys being generic.Ready Player One may have its flaws, but it's also a movie that really speaks to the nerd in me. If you're a video game or an 80s and 90s movie nerd, you'll most likely have a fun time watching it.8/10",8,0,1,8 April 2018
Split," An intense thriller from M. Night Shyamalan
","Before I state my thoughts on this movie I would just like to say that there is not way I can talk about this without spoiling the movie at least a little bit, so keep in mind that this contains spoilers.The genre of movies that Shyamalan is known for is his additions to the thriller genre. While I haven't watched any of his previous films, I was going in blindly, although from the reviews I've seen of this movie, I was expecting something good and I wasn't disappointed. As stated in the synopsis, this movie is about a man with multiple personalities who kidnapped three girls in which they try to escape from their confinement.I found the movie engaging from minute 1 to the end. I really liked the acting performances in this, especially with James McAvoy in which he had to act out multiple different people in a body, which results in interesting, bizarre and, on occasion, comical depending on who he's portraying.Another aspect that I found interesting about the film is the flashback sequences that help flesh out Casey's character. It truly does help build her character and gives a fascinating look at it.The intense moments like when the girls attempt to escape really help bring out the thrill, even with something like the build up to the conclusion brought out an adrenaline rush in me.If there was one minus I had for this movie, it would be that the ending would be confusing to the people who haven't watched his other films, I know it confused me until I researched it and it's something that brought the film down for me, but even with that, I found the film intense, thrilling and it's something I recommend to those who enjoy horrors/thrillers.",8,1,9,22 January 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Easily my favorite of the animated superhero movies I've seen
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the latest movies from Sony Picture Animation and is about the coming of age of Miles Morales, the next Spiderman. After getting bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains the powers of Spiderman and after a run-in with Kingpin, he meets Spiderman variations from different universes and needs to work together to stop him from ending the universe.2018 has been a large year for superhero films and I gotta admit I was excited for this one, mostly because of the animation style. When that's taken out, I really enjoyed this movie. The animation's style looks like a 3D version of a literal superhero comic book, and the pacing makes it feel like one too. The action is fast-paced, crisp and it really made me wonder what was going to happen next. That alone makes this film stand out from any other mainstream animated movie, which feels really refreshing.Aside from that, I enjoyed the company of every protagonist. Every Spiderman variation has a different charm to them that makes each one memorable. Take the main character Miles, who has to come to terms with accepting his father's wishes in being a better person by not looking up to his uncle instead. I think that arc was handled really well. I could go deeper into come of the other characters, but that would spoil parts of the movie.If I were to name a couple small issues with the movie, I do think it contains a weakness that most good Marvel movies share and that's a good villain. Kingpin for the most part felt pretty generic and didn't seem to have much character going for him. Aside from that, I do wish they could've gone more in-depth with Miles' relationship with his father. I have no problem with the execution of it, but I would've like to have seen more.Despite this, I highly recommend seeing this for superhero movie fans, comic book fans and animation fans. It's got amazing animation, great characters, an engaging story and lots of heart.9/10",9,8,18,15 December 2018
Dunkirk," An intense point in history during WWII as told by Christopher Nolan
","Dunkirk is the latest movie from the critically acclaimed director Christopher Nolan. Simply put, it is a true story about the evacuation of thousands of allied soldiers while they're being attacked by the German army.One of the most important things to note is that the movie's focus, aside from the first and last few minutes, is entirely dedicated to the evacuation. The little bits of dialogue, the score, the shots, everything is dedicated to that. That is this movie's strength, but also brings a minor flaw to the table. As such, there is very little dialogue, which helps set the mood for the war. The movie was also very well acted and well shot. My favorite aspect of the movie, however, has to be the score done by Hans Zimmer. For a war movie, he does an outstanding job with making the tone of the music sound just right; not too upbeat or mellow, but just fitting enough for an intense evacuation. The weakness of the movie? The characters. The characters are very lacking and extremely forgettable. They so forgettable that the only one I remembered was the captain. The only thing I could remember about the soldiers was that one of them was that one of them was played by Harry Styles for some reason.It's kind of hard to critique a movie about a nonfiction event when you're not incredibly knowledgeable about the movie's subject, in this case, World War II. As such, it's hard to determine whether the movie's portrayal is accurate or not. With that being said, I went in blindly and I feel like I gained some knowledge on the Battle of Dunkirk.9/10",9,2,8,22 July 2017
Yesterday," An intriguing, yet somewhat safe take on a unique 'what-if' scenario.
","Yesterday was brought to us by the director of Slumdog Millionaire and stars Himesh Patel as a down on his luck musician who wants more in his profession. One night however, his luck changes when the entire world forgets about The Beatles aside from him, so he naturally takes advantage of it.For the longest time, I had no idea what this film was about, yet I was still fasinated by it. Coming out of the theater, I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. Yesterday presents a genius 'what-if' scenario that presents many different questions that provoke thoughts like wat would happen to the person if they remembered The Beatles while everyone else didn't. While I mostly enjoyed how it was executed, I had a few problems with the film.The film's casting was really will-done. It has some great performances from Lily James and Ed Sheeran, but I was mostly surprised with Himesh Patel as Jack. What mostly surprised me is how amazing his singing voice was and how well he took advantage of it. I thought the first half of the movie was also pretty thought-provoking with its themes and concept. One question that the movie answers is what the world would look like if The Beatles didn't exist. I also appreciated how the movie didn't go into severaly dark territory. When we have a film like Yesterday, which is essentially a fantasy, I was genuinely happier with its lighter tone, as opposed to a realistic biopic. It has both heartbreaking and heartwarming moments all around, and that made for an overall pleasant experience.Despite being satisfied with the film's execution, I felt as if the second half felt too safe. I thought it could've been a lot more interesting; it could've gone into more depth on the problems of plagiarism and taking advantage of someone else's work despite the fact that everyone forgot about it. The film doesn't raise those question enough for me to care, and I wanted to care more about the inner conflict. I also think this film is a little out-of-touch with how modern-day music is conceived. The movie takes place over the span of months, and music tends to come and go, rather than be timeless, which is what the movie intends to say to its audience. Personally, I don't understand that logic given modern times. My final issue with the movie is that there is a cameo during the third act that I think shouldn't be there.Regardless of my issues with the film, I still enjoyed it for its light tone and interesting concepts.7/10",7,0,1,5 July 2019
Toy Story 4," Emotional, funny and heartfelt, Toy Story 4 goes to infinity and beyond to prove its worth as a part of the franchise.
","Toy Story 4 was brought to us by new director Josh Cooley and, as the title implies, is the 4th installment of the Toy Story film franchise. Sometime after the events of the first film, Bonnie begins kindergarten and crafts a toy named Forky. Forky doesn't know his place in the world, so Woody attempts to show him the ropes and teach him what being a toy is like. While doing so, the two are separanted from Bonnie and the rest of the toys, where Woody learns more about the life of a toy.I went into this movie cautiously and with high expectations because at first glance, this movie feels like a cash-grab. The previous film ended the franchise perfectly, and seeing a fourth on its way, I felt baffled. Leaving the theater, I was beyond emotionally satisfied, and pleasantly surprised with it!On the surface, this movie is consistently hilarious. Every joke had me and the audience laughing. There are many different running gags present throughout the movie that really work both comedically, and through a storytelling point of view. Forky has a running joke where he throws himself in trash cans, which I found hilarious, and the joke didn't overstay its welcome. Ducky and Bunny are two characters played by comedy duo Key and Peele, and they're easily the funniest aspect of the entire film. They have hilarious one-liners and fantasies that had the audience bursting out laughing for long periods of time. The abundance of comedy here is also an indication that this entry is far more lighthearted than the previous one.Toy Story 4 also surprised me with how well it appeals to its adult audiences much like the previous entries. It has some intersting commentary on advertisement, loyalty and products that are considered faulty. Like the previous films, it also explores aspects of life. Where the previous three looked at redundancy, retirement and death, this film looks at independence. I found it to be a very interesting take on the matter that has had me thinking about said aspect since I left the theater. I really enjoyed seeing Bo Peep again, as she brings some nice surprised to the table. I thought Gabby Gabby was an interesting villain, especially as we learn about her in-depth and about her true intentions. The movie also has its emotional moments, and they're present the most throughout the last 20 minutes. It has its moments that are both very heartwarming and have the ability to make you cry.I was really surprised to see that Toy Story 4 eceeded my expectations and gave us a fourth movie to the beloved Toy Story franchise that feels fresh and worthy of being part of the franchise. My only complaints for this movie are just nitpicks, so why should I care when the rest of the movie goes to infinity and beyond to make a phenomenal film?10/10",10,141,250,28 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity War needs to be seen to be believed!
","Avengers: Infinity War is finally here after much anticipation and it features an ensemble cast of nearly every single hero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It tells the story of how all of the heroes from the MCU must team up with the currently broken Avengers to take down Thanos, who has been searching for the Infinity Stones so he can use them for his own selfish purposes.The events for this movie have been building up since The Avengers' post credits scene. We've gotten a few glimpses of Thanos and his plot, but we haven't had a good idea on his plans. That all comes together here, where we see almost all of the heroes split into small teams before coming together and forming one large one. There is a lot of fun, yet tense action here; the opening, for instance helps set the tone, showing that this is going to be a much darker film compared to most Marvel movies. There are some high stakes that are fought for that could end up shaking the status quo permanently.Josh Brolin does a fantastic job as Thanos. Thanos gives off a very, very serious and dark vibe, which shows that he is not somebody that should be messed with. I feel as though Brolin did a perfect job doing so and is one of the best performances of the film, and that's saying something. You can tell that he had fun with his role, don't just take his word for it when he says that he had fun with it.The humor's also there and thankfully isn't too jam packed into the film. Since this is a film that fits in an onslaught of characters in a 2 and a half hour runtime, it doesn't try to fit in too much humor. I find it to be a good thing considering that it mostly tries, and succeeds in trying to be very bleak. My main issue with the movie, however, is that there is often too much going on at the same time. In the first act, (Which is pretty long since there are many characters to establish) the movie tries to juggle around 4 or 5 different plots at once. That's where the film can get disorganized and hard to process.It's hard not to spoil this film, but Avengers Infinity War is a fantastic addition to the MCU and definitely worth the hype that it's been given.9/10",9,4,10,30 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's latest film is his most laid-back, comical and impactful, although it's sure to divide lots of moviegoers.
","Once Upon a TIme... in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, which stars DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie as actors during 60s Hollywood. This film tells the story of Rick Dalton, an actor who realizes that he needs to change in order to become successful in 1960s Hollywood. The plot also involves Dalton's partner Leo, the Manson Family and Sharon Tate.The original trailer for this movie presents a lot of what I needed to know about the movie, the movie would be laid-back, and a lot different from his other works. I came out with exactly this. This movie is much more lighthearted than most of his works, as the violence and gore is very minimal. The movie intends to explore the life of a dying actor and his rerise to fame. It also presents some other plots which explore other figures the movie presents such as Leo's relation with the Manson family, as well as the life of Sharon Tate. Tarantino's take on 60s Hollywood is a very interesting one, that utilizes elements of comedy, as well as elements of 60s filmmaking. The way all of these plots come together during the third act is sure to divide audiences. I don't want to get into spilers, so all I can really say is that's it's an ending that'll either make or break the film for you. Personally, I found it very satisfying to see the final outcome, and I really like that he twists things up by the end.My only problem is that I wish they gave more character to Sharon Tate. We don't really see her very often throughout the film, and from the little that we do see of her, we don't really learn anything new about her. She gives off the idea that she has a shallow personality, which I doubt was true in reality.I had a great time seeing this movie, although I feel like it'll appeal more to fans of Tarantino's work overall. It's laid-back, surprising, comedic and ha its own stylistic touches that are unique for a Tarantino film.9/10",9,26,49,3 August 2019
The Lion King," The Lion King 2019 can be compared to an unsharpened pencil, as in they're both pointless.
","The Lion King 2019 is the live-acion remake of the 1994 animated movie of the same name. It is directed by Jon Favreau, who brought us The Jungle Book in 2016, goode start so far. This movie tells the tale of a young lion named SImba who is destined to be king after his father Mufasa, and the journey he goes through to become king in the process.I'm gonna be upfront, tis movie is a prime example of pointless. It doesn't need to exist at all and I have my reasons for saying that. For starters, the plot is a total rehash of the original animated film. Nothing of substance has been added to the film, and the stuff that is new is just useless padding. They didn't try to add in anything that could propel the film, I mean I'd be happy if we got some character depth from Scar. If you've seen the original Lion King, you've basically know what happens in this movie. Heck, there are several instances where lines from the script have been totally copy-and-pasted from the original movie. Second, all throughout watching this, I kept asking myself 'Why was this re-made in live-action?'. I asked this because remaking a movie who's only characters are animals is totally unnecessary. In order to add the animals in, they'd need to utilize CGI or train them. This movie is just CGI animals plastered on live-action backgrounds, and the CGI characters are expressionless. It was necessary for the original Lion King to be animated in order to showcase the characters' body language and facial expression properly, it works in that movie as they have the power to move people 25 years later. With this movie, I couldn't feel any emotion because you can't see it in their faces. The movie wants to focus on being realistic all-around that it doesn't think outside the box with the CGI.Are there any good qualities that this movie has? Well, yes, it has some good to it. I think that the shots of the movie are beautiful looking, and I thought that the CGI animators did a good job with animating any animals that weren't the ones that were the main focus. I thought that Hans Zimmer's score was great here, like usual. FInally, I thought that the voice acting was good, mostly. There is some great talent here and I think most of it was used well, such as Seth Rogen as Pumba, and Donald GLover as adult SImba. However, I think some of the other actors could have done a better job with what they were given, such as the voice actor for Scar, where he could've given him a more intimidating voice.Despite all the talent on display here, The Lion King 2019 fails to be good with its re-hashed story, wasted script and overly-realistic CGI. Sadly, Disney knows that this formula of remaking classics works because it's bringing in cash, and seemingly satisfying audiences. If you hate this decision like I do, then by all means vote with your wallet and don't go see Disney live-action remakes like this.3/10",3,7,11,23 July 2019
Coco," A fantastic tribute to the people of Mexico
","Coco is the latest Pixar animated feature out in theaters that is directed by Lee Unkrich who previously worked on Toy Story 3. It tells the story of a boy named Miguel who looks up to one of his ancestors named Ernesto de la Cruz who is a famous musician. Although his family, disgusted at said ancestor's decision to pursue his musical career is completely against music, so during the Day of the Dead festival, Miguel grabs a hold of Ernesto's guitar and is transported to the land of the dead. While there, he hopes to find Ernesto and receive his blessing.There are many aspects that make this movie interesting, intense and very emotional. As the movie neared the end, for example, it built up to something emotional and sad. There were people in the theater that were crying towards the end as a matter of fact. I believe this is because of how it built its characters. Aside from Miguel, the characters all have a piece of history to them that helps to connect to the very end of the film. It feels like a lot had happened before the films even began in the present day. There was no character that I did not like which really benefits as this is a character driven story. This shouldn't come off as a surprise because Pixar is known for crafting very likable characters. (Except for you Mater) The visuals are obviously gorgeously done, and I believe it's a cliché by this point to say that because this is a Pixar film. The scenery, especially in the land of the dead has so much detail. The way the skeletons move and behave is in a more cartoony fashion when compared to the living characters.My only real problem with the movie is that it does have some similar aspects to it to that of The Book of Life, another animated film about the Day of the Dead which came out in 2014. This has to do with the fact that both movies take place in the land of the dead, hold music as a big theme and are Day of the Dead themed films. If you were disappointed with that movie and want something more as a Day of the Dead themed film, I think you'll like that you see. Personally, I enjoyed Coco more than The Book of Life because it holds a more timeless feel than The Book of Life.9/10Before the movie would start, a Frozen short known as Olaf's Frozen Adventure would play. I personally found it to be nothing short of a corny slog and that it should have aired on television rather than in the theater. It was the only thing I didn't like about my experience watching Coco in the theater.",9,2,9,1 December 2017
1917," Uniquely told and beautifully brutal, 1917 is another masterfully crafted war story!
","1917 was brought to us by Sam Mendes and tells the story of two British soldiers during World War I who are sent off on a mission to stop an attack by the Germans on another base.War movies seeemed to have had a significant impact on cinema over the last few years with movies like Hacksaw RIdge and Dunkirk. 1917 continues this trend by giving us a unique, breathtaking and riveting experience. As a matter of fact, I consider this to be a masterpiece. The techniques used to tell this story work brilliantly to deliver intensity, excitement, discomfort and a sense of atmosphere.If you've heard of this movie already, odds are that you've heard that it's shot with the illusion that it's entirely one-shot. This fact turns out to be entirely true. There are no montages, no random cuts or anything like that, save for one cut at around the halfway mark. I think that what makes it work so well is that this technique makes the journey that these 2 soldiers go through feel like it's being done in real time. It helped the movie feel more engaging and interesting as it showcases everything that the soldiers go through in order to accomplish their goal.As a war film, it is rather brutal in many instances. There are many scenes and aspects that point to this being true such as the fact that there are dead bodies everywhere, there's a plane that looks like it's about to crash, and that's just from the trailers. I also really appreciate how the dialogue is very minimal. It's trying to be a story that relies mostly on its visuals, and considering its visual style, I think it really works.It mostly comes to the film's visual style working so well to tell this story about these brave soldiers hoping to stop an attack from the Germans. All I can really tell you guys is to go see this movie if you want a very real look on war! This movie is a masterpiece in my eyes.10/10",10,0,2,18 January 2020
Logan," A good movie with some flaws.
","I know that Wolverine and the X-Men are a popular Marvel superhero franchise and have had their ups and downs. Let me say for one that I have never been a person who was really into the franchise. I didn't watch the animated TV shows, read the comic or watch the movies. Because of this, I went into the movie blindly. Because of that, I will judge this movie as a movie and not as an adaptation of the comic series.Unlike what I've seen from most superhero films, the movie's focus seems to focus on the adventure aspect. Whether this is can be considered a good or bad thing is subjective. This somewhat made me feel underwhelmed considering the fact that this somewhat breaks the mold of superhero films. Normally, superhero films have many action scenes, this film on the other hand only has a handful of action scenes, and the only one I found to be interesting was the one at the end. In spite of the lack of fight scenes, the fight scenes were very well executed with interesting camera angles and camera movement, and the movements of the characters especially translated well during that final fight scene. I did really like the character growth between Logan and the girl, which might be one of the main highlights of the movie's story for me. Aside from that, I really can't judge the characters since I haven't read the comics. If there's one thing that I can give acclaim to, it's the acting. I thought the acting performances were really well done; whether it'd be Hugh Jackman as Logan or Dafne Keen as the child or many of the other actors, you'll have a hard time forgetting these acting performances for what they are.I may not have found it fantastic as many other critics have, but Logan will at least give you a memorable experience. If you're an X- Men fan, then you might like it more than I did.",8,0,3,4 March 2017
La La Land," A fantastic musical romance film with a so-so story?
","I really liked this movie. I found the tone pleasant from beginning to end. I found the main characters colorful, charming and very well developed. For me though, the most engaging parts of the movie were the musical numbers. The songs in the film were very well composed and had fantastic and powerful lyrics. The dancing and choreographic work were spectacular in this, not to mention the camera-work, which was interesting to say the least. The musical numbers, to me were the true highlight of this movie and I really wanted to see more of them. Unfortunately, what drags the movie down for me is the fact that I found the story only okay. While I found the musical bits amazing, I thought that the story wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be. There were some bits that felt too slow even though the pacing was pretty good. I also found the ending of the movie to be very confusing. I personally didn't find the movie amazing like many people did, only good.",7,3,6,21 January 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The Guardians are back in action!
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the second installment of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it's about the latest adventure of the titular team. While escaping from a team of bounty hunters, they come across Star-lord's father, Ego, and discover the powers that he holds and what Star- Lord was destined to do.Now I didn't watch the original Guardians of the Galaxy, but from what I had heard, it was supposed to be incredible. Because of this, I expected this movie to be that way too.To an extent, I was pretty pleasantly surprised by the movie. The characters held the same charm that they did in the original movie with the heroes being flawed yet still very lovable. The movie gives our main character Starlord some more depth, which is something that I really appreciated. Somehow, I found the new Baby Groot even more charming than Groot from the original film. He provides the comedy and gives some of the more intense scenes such as the intro a more light hearted feel. The movie has a lot of funny moments. The Awesome Mix was also really good with many great classic songs as well.If there's one complaint I have with this movie, it's that it wasn't quite as fresh as the original Guardians of the Galaxy, as it holds a heavy focus on the relationship between Starlord and Ego. Either way, it is the must watch superhero film as of right now and I highly recommend seeing it!9/10",9,6,10,20 May 2017
The Disaster Artist," The Disaster Artist is both an endearing and hilarious biopic from the Franco brothers.
","The Disaster Artist is a biographical film about Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero and the making of one of the worst movies ever made called The Room. This movie stars James and Dave Franco and is also about the friendship that develops between both Wiseau and Sestero.This is an Ed Wood-esque film about a man aspiring to work in the movie industry who, despite continuously getting knocked down over and over, continued to follow his dreams. In terms of it as a movie, it's similar to that of Ed Wood. Either way, this is a hysterical, endearing look at two underdogs who unintentionally made it big. I was laughing out loud frequently at this film, almost every joke hit, if not, every joke hit. I wasn't the only one frequently laughing either, the entire theater was laughing, even during scenes initially shown in trailers. Aside from the comedy, this offers more than just that. This movie offers a look at Tommy's softer side, which I personally could hardly see out of a guy like Tommy. It was genuinely hard to see him looking saddened and heartbroken during said scenes. James Franco's performance was absolutely fantastic. From the accent, to Tommy's strange acting to his overall performance, he just simply did an incredible job portraying Tommy. I heard that he even directed the entire movie in his Tommy voice, which is incredible, even for him. Near the end, they reenact certain scenes from The Room such as the 'I did not hit her!' scene and the flower shop scene, which were very impressive and spot on.My flaws for this movie are small and few in between. For example, I think that the other actors from The Room like Juliette Danielle could've used a more in-depth look. I remember hearing that she was uncomfortable doing the sex scenes with Tommy and I wish we would've gotten a bit more out of her regarding that. Another flaw that I have is more of a nitpick. It's that James Franco's voice hardly sounds anything like Tommy's. It's not his fault though, again I'm nitpicking more than anything.I loved this movie, even with its small flaws. The Disaster Artist is anything but a disaster with its intriguing story, great humor and heartbreaking moments about one very strange man's dream of becoming a big name in Hollywood and managed to become big in the end for the wrong reasons.9/10",9,0,2,16 December 2017
American Made," A great comeback for Tom Cruise after his role in The Mummy.
","American Made stars Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, a pilot who begins working for the CIA and begins a big business as a result, which eventually leads him into some difficulties with the law.After seeing the movie, I have to say that this is an interesting, immersive movie. Within the first 5-10 minutes, I got easily sucked into the movie. Tom Cruise does a great job playing the lead role of the movie. It does have a hint of a Goodfellas vibe with the way the movie's story is told in a fast pace, but it still is told in its own unique way that is hard to get into because it goes into spoiler territory. My main flaw with the movie, however, is the pacing. Often times, the movie feels like it is moving too quickly and it feels hard to sink in what has happened in certain scenes. With that being said, it ks a movie that should be watched a few times over because a lot happens throughout the duration of the movie. Tom Cruise's American Made is definitely worth the watch even despite the small narration flaw8/10",8,1,4,2 October 2017
Kong: Skull Island," A much different take on the King Kong franchise
","After the Vietnam war, a team of scientists and military men investigate an uncharted island full of ferocious monsters including an ape named Kong.This movie acts as a new installment to the King Kong franchise, an a much different take at that. Personally, I'm one of those people who wasn't extremely fond of the 2005 King Kong remake and because of that, I was anticipating this movie. Unfortunately, it ended up being a mixed bag.To start with the bads, I found some of the green-screening way too obvious. This trend can first be seen during the beginning of the movie as some of the backgrounds don't match up with ones from the last or next shots, as an example. Another issue I had was with the ending. Without spoiling anything, I have to say that the ending of the movie feels unfinished; it left me confused and had me asking myself: 'Wait, that's it?' However, my main issue with the movie is that despite the fact that the movie's title has the name Kong in it, we barely see him outside of the beginning and ending, and that's pretty disappointing for me. As someone who wanted to see more of King Kong throughout the film, it kind of is a letdown to see that he only has very few appearances. My final complaint has to be that the movie feels too different from its previous installments. When you go into a remake or reboot of an older movie, you'd expect them to at least somewhat follow the formula of the original work. That's not the case here, as it seems like the film is trying to be its own thing. Granted, they do pay homages to the original movie, but it doesn't save this from being one of the movie's weaknesses.Now let's take a look at the goods. To start, the environments were beautiful. The movie gives us a breathtaking look at an uncharted island and it makes you want to see it for yourself. Another strength of the movie has to be the action scenes. The action scenes just looked plain awesome and they were the highlight of the film. The action scenes had a lot of engaging and gripping moments that left me on the edge of my seat. I don't want to spoil the movie, so if you'd like to watch the action scenes in this, then you should go see it for yourselves. The last strength of the movie is that it feels different; it's both the film's strength and weakness. The only real positive I can say about the movie being different is that it does a great job at being its own thing.Overall, I find the movie to be a mixed bag. I like the action scenes, environment and the fact that it's trying to do something different with the franchise; although that is a weakness as well as the fact that we don't see the star very often.",6,1,3,12 March 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Meh.
","Murder on the Orient Express is a film that is based on the book of the same name and a remake of the version made in the 70s directed by Sidney Lumet. The movie follows a very talented and skilled detective named Hercule Poirot who happens to take a trip on the Orient Express. The ride was all fine and good until the train gets stopped and the fact that someone was murdered on the trip. Now it is up to Poirot to uncover the mystery of the murder.Now I have not read the book nor have I watched the original movie. With that being said, I found this movie to be quite a mixed bag. As for the aspects that I think the movie did a good job on, I thought the cinematography, for one, was great. In terms of the movie's look, it was a very well shot movie that used great angles. I also found the acting to be pretty good. Barangh does a great job at his role as Poirot and so do many of the other actors in their roles such as such as Odom and Ridley.My big issue with the movie, however, has to do with the general story of the film. The overall story managed to feel too slow. To put this in perspective, I found the first act to be too long which to me felt like a sign of a slow movie. Don't get me wrong, we need calm moments in films, but the pacing just felt too slow during multiple occasions which just left me bored with the films.5/10",5,3,7,23 November 2017
The Iron Giant," Simply a masterpiece.
","The Iron Giant is an animated film directed by Brad Bird. It is about a giant alien robot who landed on earth from outer space in the year 1957 and seems to have gotten amnesia. He meets and befriends a young boy named Hogarth, who shows the robot how to be a good person. While doing so, he must keep the robot safe from the public and especially from the U.S. government who is trying to track down what crashed on the planet.I watched this movie at my local theater this week because it was only two dollars a seat and because I was very curious about this one and I left the theater very satisfied with my experience. I couldn't have liked this movie more if I tried. The critics don't lie with this one, it's a well-written, well-polished animated family masterpiece. It is something that both kids and adults can watch and enjoy wholeheartedly.Staring with the animation, it uses a combination of both traditional animation and computer animation. Almost everything in the movie is traditionally animated and then we have the robot who is, at all times, computer animated. Surprisingly, the animators manage to blend in the robot with its surroundings perfectly. The animation doesn't feel out of place with either the 3D or traditional animation, which is a pretty amazing sight to see.The overall feel to it felt out of the ordinary from what you would find in most modern animated movies outside of Disney and Pixar. I feel like a lot of other companies try too hard to make their animated movies part comedy nowadays. With this movie, there were some funny moments, but they didn't parade the movie entirely. Instead, they're replaced with emotionally swinging, powerful moments that give it a very mature feel. For a family movie, it is quite mature, it's one of those movies that's rated PG for a reason. It delves into some very sensitive topics that were and still are relevant to the movie's time period such as fear and prejudice as well as what could lie beyond our world. To further that it's a more mature film, it does have some adult humor and language.I liked all the characters in the movie. I liked the simple, quirky and lonely boy that was Hogarth. Kent was a menacing, unsettling villain who always kept his watchful eye on the main character as two examples. My favorite character of them all has to be the titular character. He's a simple, yet deep and complex character. I won't go too in-dept on him since it would go into spoiler territory, but we do find out about his complexity much later which changes the mood of the movie.Going blindly into this movie was a decision that I do not regret. The Iron Giant is a must watch for anyone who loves animated, movies or just wants a good movie experience. I don't think I found a single flaw or con with this movie when I watched it, it was an experience that I won't forget.10/10",10,1,2,29 June 2017
Life," Bonechilling, frightening and unexpecting with...empty characters?
","I'm starting to notice a trend in movies throughout the beginning of the year. Ever since January, we've been getting quite a few different horror/thriller films this year. The results have been mixed to generally positive; Split and Get Out have received positive attention for instance. And now we have Life.Life is about a group of six astronauts who discover a single cell on Mars. They all research it for a while, the cell grows into a life form, and they discover that the life form is very deadly, and the astronauts must work together to keep it from reaching earth.I'm going to start with what I didn't like about the movie. My main issue with it has to be the characters. For the most part, they feel very dry and empty. So much so that I couldn't remember a thing about them. There were only two characters who felt like they had any sense of character. The two I'm talking about are Ariyon Bakare's character since he is a scientist and holds a lot of focus in the beginning as the main researcher. Then there's Hiroyuki Sanada's role. His reasoning for wanting to go back to earth makes him the only character I wanted to root for. Aside from that, it's hard for me to care about the movie's characters.If I were to talk about the things I liked about it, I would like to start with the overall feeling of the movie. After the first act, everything begins to feel tense. There are many tense scenes that have left me feeling horrified, and that's what I believe is the main strength of the movie. If you're going into a thriller movie, you'll expect many intense moments. That's what you get throughout the movie. Something I find very impressive throughout it is that almost the entirety of the film takes place in a space vessel. It's amazing how well it plays into the movie and how well the director, actors and cameraworkers perform their duties and how the movie works so well in such a small, boxed in area. I had my doubts walking in, but what works works really well. Another thing I liked about it was how it ended. I'm not gonna go in-depth with it because that would lead into spoiler territory.Overall, I thought this movie was very frightening and unexpecting. It had many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, the movie's weakness would have to be the characters. But I can forgive that with its gripping and thrilling plot.",8,214,368,26 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," It's pretty mixed all around, but definitely frightening!
","Alien: Covenant is the latest installment to the Alien franchise and is directed by Ridley Scott who worked on the original Alien and Prometheus. It is about a crew known as Covenant who traces an unknown signal from an unknown planet that is believed to be safe and while doing so, they run into some danger as those alien creatures begin to pop out.Like the franchise's many predecessors, this movie is pretty dang scary. It becomes suspenseful during certain points that you wouldn't necessarily expect. If you're into gore and blood, this is definitely the type of movie for you as it offers a lot of it. I'm serious, the movie can get pretty vile during some points, it's pretty insane. I could really feel the pain of the characters who had to deal with the aliens. Out of all of the characters, I found David to be the most interesting one. I just like how he is this cyborg, which helps in some interesting ways such as giving him an interesting connection to the aliens.My biggest flaw I have with this movie is that while it has some good twists and plot points, I don't think the movie went too in- depth on them. They just bring the viewers questions that beg an answer. I did find the story somewhat interesting because of these twists and plot points, but it felt a little too basic, and I found the characters okay, but not very strong.I found this movie to be pretty decent as a stand alone movie. As an overall Alien movie, it would depend more on a fan's perspective of the movie. Personally, I've only seen parts of the original Alien from the 70s, so I don't think I can judge too much.7/10",7,12,24,26 May 2017
