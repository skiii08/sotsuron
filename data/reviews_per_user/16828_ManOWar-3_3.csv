The Ring," discombobulating
","Maybe it was the fact that I waited to watch this on video, but this movie didn't impact as much as I thought it would.  Normally, I like a story that doesn't explain everything, and leaves the viewer to wonder about plot lines and conventions.  'The Ring', however, even after my second home viewing, seems to be reaching and grasping for its 'plot twist'.  It is never really clarified for me why a video tape is the tool used to scare the death out of those who view it (although it makes an interesting premise for a way to spread the young girl's pain and suffering that she wanted to share with the world).  The flashbacks to the tape images as Naomi Watts' character found them in her search were not as distracting as I first thought, but overall lacked clarity when things come full-circle (disturbing as they were).5 out of 10",5,0,1,1 April 2003

","Yes, some other user beat me to the punch, using the title as a negative quip.  But, damn, I expected much more from the normally fabulous Kate Hudson.  It wasn't the acting, however, that drove me over the edge.  The writing was absolutely atrocious and predictable.  What did I expect?  Well, I'll tell you:  to be entertained.  With an audience guffawing at punch lines like 'You're not fat!' I was immediately turned off.  The script barely reached beyond what it could have achieved in this hum-drum 'comedy'.  Why try, when you have an audience falling out of it's chairs at the sight of a dog peeing on a pool table.  Whoa!Standout performances by Adam Goldberg and Bebe Neuworth, even though she had to endure saying the title of the movie in half of her dialogue.  Now that's 'bulls**t'...",5,0,0,25 February 2003
The Thin Red Line," Apples and Oranges
","I see that several users have compared 'The Thin Red Line' to 'Saving Private Ryan'.  While both have to do with WWII and the trials and tribulations of war, they are really not all that comparable.  And I don't mean in the 'good or bad' sense; I mean in the fact that just because the neatly packaged mile-a-minute 'Saving Private Ryan' appealed to the mainstream audience (myself included), 'The Thin Red Line' takes time to actually breathe.And with that methodic pacing, no not 'plodding', I found myself on the edge of my seat.  The movie's very different approach to realism, as well as surrealism, sustained my interest, even with the perplexing monologues. You'll notice that the different voices overheard have much to do with the reflection of existence and man's relationship with the world around him. Yes, even with battle, I could imagine one would reflect on his existence- as short lived as it might be.  This is captured perfectly at almost every moment with the American's invasion on this Pacific Island.I found 'Saving Private Ryan' to be more of a tightly wrapped package, with it's character driven plot and a very different film confined to certain constraints; it does let loose, but is so much more the emotionally manipulative film.  'The Thin Red Line' has its characters more as heralds of emotions and states of mind.  No it wasn't the gore extravaganza that war films tend to be, but it rather uses war, WWII in particular, as a vehicle to show what happens when morality collides with life and death. (By the way, it did win it's share of awards, just not the ones that Hollywood tends to pat itself on the back with...  :P ).",Null,0,0,14 September 2000
