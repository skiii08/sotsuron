Minority Report," A nice visualization for a movie with no Vision
","In the summer 2002 'everybody run', so I ran to see Minority Report the 42nd movie of Mr. Spielberg (as a director) after the disappointing A.I. in 2001. Mr. Spielberg is part of those directors to whom you will always give a chance no matter what. Unfortunately this 'no matter what' just happen once again with Minority Report. The main concept of the movie is the obsession of vision / visualization. In fact the dynamic between vision and visualization is the dialectic, the key that we need to take the movie a little step further. The movie describes how a vision is generated then visualized and finally how this visualization is rationalized and used: triplets mutants lying in a bathtub filed of amniotic fluid generate visions of future crimes that are visualize on a screen and organized by John Anderton (chief police Tom Cruise) in order to find clues that will help the pre-crime department to arrest the suspect/convict before the crimes are committed. Obviously Mr. Spielberg tried here to raise some fundamentals questions: 1)Isn't the concept of Justice linked (in theory) with the concept of certitude? In other words is what we see always certain or subject to interpretation? 2)Isn't Justice supposedly 'blind' but however subjective in essence? 3)What degree of freedom are we willing to give up in exchange of safety? Meaning, who is suppose to watch the people who are watching us...isn't it a dynamic base on a 'vicious circle' principle? The positive thing about Minority Report is that the movie lays out pretty well those questions and do so through an almost perfect visualization on screen. The picture is perfect: very nice bleached blue grain reinforce the 'cold techno' ton of the movie. The acting is nothing special but still can be ranked as good. Some scenes are just a jewel and are very powerful: to note the floor by floor identity check by the robot spiders. However Minority report has 2 major problems. The first one is the lack of originality. The picture grain is the same as in 'A.I', the cars reminded me of 'Tron', the police squad erupting from the roof are straight from 'Brazil', even the 'film noir' atmosphere that Spielberg wanted to impose is a re-creation from 'Blade Runner'. The second problem lies in the scenario itself. The concept of the triplets who can visualize the future is a little bit hard to believe: their visions are limited to a certain area (why?) and they can only see crimes (why?). Above all the personal story of John Anderton (Tom Cruise) completely lacks of depth and ends in a fire works of cheesiness with a sparkle of 'zero-creativity' stained with 'uselessness'. I mentioned that this movie is about vision and visualization. Mr. Spielberg is a master of visualization, unfortunately he did not have any vision for this movie. The same way he invited the audience to run he ran for an easy success but forgot that in sci-fi, Vision is about re-inventing the genre. As a result we have a nice movie but not a masterpiece.",6,4,5,24 July 2002
Blade II," Now Blade has a Soul...
","Blade I was what I call a good rental for 'popcorn eater': good action scenes, descent acting but nothing more. Blade II is what I call a true motion picture, a cinematic experience. How many sequels (in the horror genre) are better than the original movie? Moreover how many good comics adaptation do we know of? 'Few' is the answer for both questions and Blade II might be among those 'few'. It is a multi-layers movie where the action/horror fanatic will have what they're looking for, a Vampire/Kung Fu flick (and that's fine) however those of us who are asking for more than just another Blade sequel might discover a very thought through movie blend in a myriad of details with extraordinary fight sequences (thanks to Donnie Yen) and a 'design' feel to it. Obviously the main critic against Blade II is a very 'simplistic' scenario when you know from the beginning what is going to happen: the story is about Blade (Wesley Snipes) who is half vampire, half human and refuses his vampire nature trying to fight the 'bloodlust' he suffers. His hatred for the vampire and therefore half of himself is unlimited. In this sequel Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire nation in order to face an even greater enemy: the reapers who feed on vampires as well as on human (who are luckily to us close to Blade's heart). The scenario is simple but not simplistic and Guillermo del Toro 'tour de force' is to give volume to this scenario by blending it in a very design atmosphere exploring the notion of 'Duality'. Blade's duality is obvious: he is fighting half of himself like a metaphoric evil within each and every one of us. The secret of his redemption does not lie in what he is but in what he does and what he feels. His quest for humanity ends at the same time as his hatred for the vampires but moreover for himself. On the opposite the reapers are bodies/corpses, their reasons for being are purely physical, basics (they live to feed) their appearance pushes the limits of horror (reaching the borders of gore) in order to demonstrate how unhuman they really are, in other words how 'Essence' (where you come from) in that case human or vampire is not what matters. This gap between the beauty of Blade (Wesley Snipes) or Nyssa Damaskinos (Leonor Varela) and the reapers (Luke Goss etc...) emphasis the gab between 'Soul' and 'Soulless'. Guillermo del Toro delivers his best movie (after Mimic in 1997). Unlike Mimic which was a well directed but average horror movie Blade II is an exceptional horror movie supported by terrific actors (Kris Kristofferson, Ron Perlam etc...). Witnessing on screen the birth of a Soul is not a usual thing. Guillermo del Toro managed to do it in a paradoxical beautiful manner.",7,24,46,28 August 2002
Full Metal Jacket," `The dead know only one thing: it's better to be alive'
","Mr. Stanley Kubrick was not a prolific director. After 71 years walking this Earth he left us with only 16 movies among which some of the most powerful cinematic experience to date. `Full Metal Jacket' is part of Mr. Kubrick's list of masterpiece and was released 12 years before his last movie `Eyes Wide Shut' as War always precedes Denial.Having a total control on his Picture from the writing to the editing, what you see on the screen is what he wanted you to seeand what we see is close to a perfect demonstration: One can learn to kill. Through this learning one looses his individuality. By loosing his individuality one can loose is Innocence and reach Madness and of course during all those steps something can go wrong To make this demonstration as obvious on paper as on screen you have to be methodic (as methodic as Stanley Kubrick) and you have to have the right actors and the right acting. Matthew Modine (Pvt Joker), Vincent D'Onofrio (Pvt Gomer Pyle) and R.Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sgt. Hartman) are a good example of how pristine the casting was. In order to draw a clear conclusion Stanley Kubrick used the chapter technique and delivers a 2 chapters demonstration.
Chapter One  The building of a Corp.  The Training. Here Mr. Kubrick shows us how a Marine Corp. is built, how one can learn to kill and how through this learning one looses his individuality. This building has to go through 2 major processes: Humiliation and Team building. The humiliation process consists in the destruction of your ego, because your ego is what makes you unique. If an organization breaks your ego then you are most likely to be just like everybody else. Private Gomer Pyle is the perfect example of how someone goes through this humiliating process: he is the most humiliated Private and we all remember this wonderful quote from the Gunnery Sergeant Hartman Drill Instructor (R.Lee Ermey):'Are you quitting on me?! Well, are you?! Then quit, you slimy *beep* walrus-looking piece of *beep*! etc' The second process in the building of a Corp., is in fact the team building process: It is an equally important process because at the end of this process each team member only exists through the team, alone each of them is `equally worthless' as our favorite Sergeant Instructor would say. Obviously something will go wrong because there is no such thing as invincibility (it's a chimer at best, a lie). The suicide scene is therefore the transition between the notion of individuality and the notion of Corp., between chapter one and chapter two. Admirably played by our 3 protagonist (Private Joker and Pyle and the Sergeant Drill Instructor) it emphasis the only true statement of the movie: `we live in a world of *beep*' and `the dead know only one thing: it's better to be alive'. Chapter Two  Disintegration of a Corp.  The War. This second piece of the demonstration (one can loose his innocence) is fueled with two dynamics: the desire of the killing and the reality of war. The desire of the killing is impersonating by Pvt `Joker', he is a combat correspondent who doesn't really understand the meaning of this War. At the same time he is `born to kill' and think that the combat will bring meaning to this absurdity. This contradiction is very well sum up in the following memorable quote from Pvt Joker: `I wanted to meet stimulating and interesting people of an ancient culture and kill them. I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill.' As soon as Pvt Joker links up with Pvt Cowboy, Mr. Kubrick makes us dive in `the reality of war' and the disintegration of the Corp. begins: The lieutenant goes first with him the authority, one by one the Marines falls under the fire of a sniper. The climax of this chapter is the fugitive vision of the sniper. The platoon has reached the border of Madness, where `a day without blood is like a day without sunshine'. Did Pvt Joker found the meaning he was looking for? Can we control the dogs of war once we've unleashed them? Once again there is no lesson only one statement as the thoughts of Pvt Joker `drift back to erect nipple wet dreams about Mary Jane Rottencrotch and the Great Homecoming *beep* Fantasy.' He is `so happy that he is alive, in one piece and short. He lives in a world of *beep* yes. But he is alive and not afraid'. Innocence is lost foreverleft on the ground by the corpses and their `Full Metal Jackets'.",8,60,82,22 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," How a trilogy masterpiece turns into an ordinary blockbuster.
","Star Wars is the very first movie I saw in a theater when it was released in 1977. The movie is really my first cinematic experience and since then I am a Star Wars fan. The movie became mythical with the Empire strikes back (1980) and the Return of the Jedi (1983). But then the myth was not resurrected with The Phantom Menace. The Attack of the Clones seems to be George Lucas second attempt to resurrect the legend created 25 years ago. Let's try not to be lenient and understand why this second attempt is in fact a second failure.This prequel (The Attack of the Clones) starts 10 years after the Episode 1 and is built around 3 major dynamics: - A love story between Anakin Skywalker who has become the `arrogant' Padawan (Jedi apprentice) of the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and shares a forbidden love with Padme Amidala who has given up her throne for a senate seat. - A political intrigue: A mysterious separatist movement (born in Phantom Menace) and led by Count Dooku is threatening to start a civil war and to rebel against the Republic. - Finally, we witness the beginning of Anakin turning towards the Dark side of the Force.The scenario in `Attack of the Clones' has some inconsistency but is still very decent and overall in line with the Star Wars heritage. This scenario is very well supported by the special effects, which I have to admit are among the best yet in the Star Wars saga. Some of the scenes are amazing. To note the very well built and beautifully shot scene when Obi-Wan lands on the clone planet and then meet the cloners as well as Jango Fet who served as a model for the clone army. Also the space hunt when Jango Fet is planing to reach Geonosis, while Obi-Wan is tracking him down is just a formidable piece of work. However Episode II demonstrates that fantastic special effects and a bunch of well built and well shot scenes are not enough to resurrect a Myth, not even to do a good movie.1. The first point and the least important is that Attack of the Clones has too many characters. Each of them has very little to say. As a result none of the characters has real depth. The movie is already 2 hours and 23 minutes long, therefore it was practically impossible to have strong personality/charismatic characters displaying a full range of feelings and emotions on screen; as a consequence and almost from the beginning the movie characters turn out very much flat. 2. The flatness of the characters is (I believe) not the only mistake in `Attack of the Clones' and sometimes the structure of the movie, meaning length and choice of scenes seems to me very wrongly thought through and often lacks of imagination. As an example the chase of the terrorist in the beginning of the movie if, I acknowledge is very well done, I also think is way too long comparing to the length of the whole movie. From a scene choice stand point Anakin Skywalker is suppose to show his dark side when his mum dies in his arms but we don't really see him turning to the dark side since George Lucas decided not to show us Anakin's cruelty annihilating the entire tribe of the sand people. It seems to me that such a scene would have been much more essential (and not necessarily gory) than watching him riding his cheesy `motorbike'. The battle scene when the clones eventually attack is very well done (from a computer generated picture standpoint) but remains very much confusing. Not to mention the lack of strategy (at least in the shown scenes) which is flabbergasting and below the standard of `The Empire strikes back' in which we had an idea of what the strategy from both side was. Finally Samuel L. Jackson closing slowly on Count Dooku on the balcony of the arena made me think of `Conan the Barbarian' when Conan is carefully walking on Thulsa Doom at the end of the movie. And you know what, Mace Windu chopped off the head of Jango Fet as Conan the head of the villain. I thought that George Lucas had more imagination than that(come on !!!). 3. That brings me to one of the main problem of the movie: `acting'. Sorry for all the lovers of Natalie Portman (Padme Amidala) but she is so stiff and her play so wooden that C-3PO and R2-D2 seem to be more human than she is. When Natalie Portman falls out of the chopper like ship when trying to capture Count Dooku a clone soldier comes to her asking if she's hurt and all of a sudden after a crappy statement she is completely fine back on the chase(Nooo). More than that I don't see love during love scenes, I don't see passion during passionate scenes, she looks a little bit `teenagy' during the action scene, the only credit goes to the cameraman as well as her make-up artist who really make her look very good and even gorgeous sometimes. Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) is not a mature actor and does not embody the `Jedi Spirit' that Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) carried in `The Return of the Jedi'. His love looks fake when he talks to and looks at Padme. His sadness looks fake when his mother dies. His anger looks fake when he explains how he wiped out the sand people tribe. And he is lacking of energy when he fights with the lightsaber. Samuel L. Jackson (master Mace Windu) can not really do something with the little he has to say. Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) are doing a decent job. The best actor of all is Yoda (Frank Oz voice) who is a computer generated character (come on !!!???). 4. Bad acting is not only the actors fault: Dialog/script is the second major problem in this movie. We saw that the characters don't have much to say but on the top of it what they say is pitiful. That was one of the strength of Star Wars trilogy (mystical dialog, good sense of humor). Here the dialogs are set up as for a drama play (this is a motion picture not a play in a Theater!).  I am passing on the love scene script (remember the story of the coarse sand), which is really poor but even the confrontation's scene are awful with no imagination, so flat and sometimes ridiculous. For instance when Anakin talks to Padme about Obi-Wan: `It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous. He's holding me back!' (what kind of reaction is that???) or Obi-Wan and Dooku: `I will never join you Dooku!' (come on, don't play it like in a Shakespeare play!!!). 5. My final point and to my opinion the most important one is that the prequel does not convey the mysticism that the trilogy is all about. The `Force' appears to be just a tagline `may the force be with you' and (just like a bad advertising line). The bad guy (count Dooku) is not that scary, and the Jedis are not very wise. Some scenes are not consistent with the trilogy for example when Obi-Wan entered Count Dooku's fortress, he is not detected by Dooku who is suppose to have mastered the force and should have sense a disturbance (remember the Trilogy). Where is the fear, where is the thrill, where is the feeling of power/weakness, and where is the feeling of destiny/fate?George Lucas said that he did not do `The Attack of the Clone' (and `The Phantom Menace') for the fans. I can understand this statement even if the very reason he can do `The Attack of the Clones' it's because of those very fans. Maybe each generation has its own movie. Maybe Star Wars Trilogy belongs to the 80s whereas Episode I and II to the `new millennium'. That might be the explanation, but I thought that George Lucas did re-invest his own money to build his own movie in order to escape the dictatorship of Hollywood. However what he delivers is a typical Hollywood blockbuster.",6,2,4,7 June 2002
The Lives of Others," Slow yet intense...Minimalist yet full of emotions
","Das Leben der Anderen (aka the Lives of Others) by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck delves the audience in the atmosphere of East Germany at a time when the word Freedom was defined by the Communist Party. Mainly shot in the old Stasi Headquarter the film manages to provide as much for the protagonist as for the audience the coldness of both the feeling and decorum.Through 'Das Leben der Anderen' Mr. von Donnersmarck represents a new generation of German filmmakers who try the 'reconquista' of their own History, proposing a reflection on the long separation of the two Germanys. The story takes place in the early eighties in East Germany where the successful auteur George Dreyman and his lover, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland are considered to be part of the intellectual elite even though they don't share the communism ideal.'Das Leben der Anderen' is a slow movie but never a boring one it builds up tension while developing multitude of thematic. Beside the obvious denunciation of a system which is indeed falling, the film talks about 'love' and how the love of art can sometimes be stronger than the physical one or how individual are in essence individualistic.Serve with a terrific cast 'Das Leben der Anderen' is a cinematic achievement. Ulrich Mühe knows how to express feeling with minimal words but an expressive visage, Sebastian Koch understands the term 'character embodiment' and the very sexy Martina Gedeck makes herself desirable and so profoundly human.Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck manages to describe a dark period in a non Manichean way. He explores through an efficient scenario a troubled History with no complex, realism and humanity. Das Leben der Anderen is a sincere movie and true cinema is indeed about sincerity.",8,2,4,11 April 2007
The Elephant Man," A baroque masterpiece
","'Elephant Man' is the 6th movie from David Lynch and probably is most 'baroque' work. Staged in Victorian England, directed in 1980 and shot in black and white. Elephant Man might very well be one of the most powerful movies in history so far... The film is based on the true story of John Merick, the Elephant Man. David Lynch adapted this story following a very basic/simple narrative construction, emerging the audience in part of the life of John Merick from the time when he gets noticed in a freak show by a British surgeon to the time...(well you'll find out by yourself). The interpretation of both Anthony Hopkins as the British surgeon, Dr. Frederick Treves and John Hurt as the Elephant Man, John Merick is 'mistakeless'. The ton is right from beginning to end. Not one dialog is overplayed or downplayed. Overall the actors deliver an amazing performance. Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Kendal) is acting so true, John Gielgud (Carr Gomm) is the archetype of the humanist gentleman and Freddie Jones (Bytes) is impersonating this pathetic drunk vile character to perfection. The picture itself is flawless and very well balanced: few close up, few traveling. Every camera technique serves only one purpose: telling the story. The black and white picture is the perfect fit and reinforces the 'baroque' like atmosphere as well as helps the audience focus on the feelings demonstrated by all actors. Feelings are really what make this 'quest for humanity' an exceptional cinematic experience. It is an 'initiatic journey'. We start with a descent in Horror, dehumanization and monstrosity; we climb back to decency and tolerance to eventually arrive at the door of 'humanism'. We need to remember that how we act is who we are. If we act like animals we are animals and if we act like human beings we in fact become human beings. In other words we are not human by essence but we become human through our actions. In this regards John Merick appears to be the human one among us...Once again and after 'Eraserhead' (1977), David Lynch is demonstrating his skills in terms of 'mise-en-scene'. He is comfortable handling weirdness and monstrosity and he does so with maestro, triggering our deepest fear, our darkest side and eventually the more human part of our body: our heart",8,7,8,29 July 2003
Hero," Stunning cinematography, technical 'tour de force', dubious historical accuracy make for a disappointing movie
","Hero is a film that has to be seen, if only to make the inevitable Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon comparisons. Much-awaited wuxia, Hero is a visually-stunning mixture of art film, martial arts action, and dubious historical accuracy. Even though the oversimplified politics could raise the eyebrows of the initiated, the photography of the film only is a delight for the eye and a reason to see the movie. Looking at the film I understand better where the focus went. The scenario took 2 years of writing and yet the film fails at this level. Zhang Yimou wanted to redefine the definition of Hero and did that through an oversimplified political plot, the results from a story telling stand point is catastrophic as no emotions whatsoever arise from the characters. Their depiction is reduced to almost dull snapshots. Even the Rashomon-like storytelling does not work that well as technique can never replace substance. However the glorious cinematography of Christopher Doyle who uses specific color tones to highlight different versions of the events is a tremendous achievement. Red designates a more passionate accounting, while blue highlights a version colored by personal loss and sadness. Green, white and yellow come into play too, though to assign meanings and motifs to each and every color scheme. If anything, the different colors work as an effective narrative device that separates the various versions of the tale. In fact technique is what Hero is all about and in that matter, the film is a masterpiece. The costumes, production design, cinematography and martial arts choreography are all award-worthy. To note most martial arts fans will be delighted with the work of choreographers Ching Siu-Tung and Stephen Tung Wai. We've isolated the facts that Hero is a technical masterpiece with a catastrophic story telling dynamic but what about the message? First of all the fact that the story is based on history causes a few problems. The film posits that Ying Zheng's quest to conquer China is as much about protection as it is about tyranny, a version of events that not all historians may find agreeable. Is it proper to simplify the forces of history into a palm-sized package? More troubling are the modern political implications of the film's message. There is an obvious nod towards the importance of the greater good: 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.' That's a fine message still, if one were to apply that thinking to modern times, some people (like the Taiwanese) might not be so swayed. I rarely saw cinematography that beautiful, however cinema is first about telling story, Zhang Yimou might have lost himself in the aesthetic realm of cinema...",6,1,1,9 July 2004
The Dark Knight," There are so few good films, The Dark Knight looks like one.
","I fail to see what is so brilliant in Batman 'The Dark Knight'. Is it the title? Because it certainly not the film itself. Let's start with what is (if not Oscar worthy) goodIn 'The Dark Knight' the acting is not at stake. Special mention to Heath Ledger; he managed to do something interesting with the character of the Joker. Tough job as the Joker's past is indeed a mystery. All we know in the film is that his motivation is fairly limited. He just wants to bring chaos not so randomly it seemsIt is hard to embody someone with as little background elements as water in the Sahara desert and a motivation as thin as air. Plus the script did not really help with the endless version on how he got his scars. However Heath Ledger manages to deliver a good performance by playing a pretty generic sadistic psychotic. Christian Bale is hard to judge. Spending most of his time in a bat suit doesn't really help to determine whether or not his performance is good. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman do so little than even the credibility they are supposed to provide is inexistent. Finally Aaron Eckhardt plays a rather uninteresting Harvey Dent; His 'Two-Face' part is too short to indeed develop his character. To close the acting chapter I have to point out how poorly written the script sounded. I didn't get away with one memorable quote. Not a good sign On to the film itself: very well shot even though one has to regret in the opening shot the reflection of the edge of the helicopter in the building's glass. Moreover did you notice how generic Gotham is depicted? Some would have you believe it was a deliberate choice to make Gotham looks more realI tell you it was driven by laziness and zero artistic vision. This is symptomatic on how seriously the film is taking itself Secondly I profoundly questioned the coherence of the film. Let me push forward my evidences by throwing at you the questions that popped in my head while watching the film from the most trivial to the more important ones: Why can the dogs chew on the bullet proof bat suit? Why a witness could pull a gun on a Lawyer while being on the witness stand? (body search anyone?) How the Joker manages to keep a pencil straight on a table while a dozen of gangsters are trying to reach out to him for a good old hand to hand Fight. Why the most famous patient of a hospital under terrorist threats can't be evacuated? Why the Joker would sets fire of a dollar bills pyramid? He said that money is not important to him. What's important to him is bringing chaos. But then why would he rob banks for a living then? Why is Bruce Wayne so obsessed with an ugly girl? How does this Sonar thing works? How could two Ferry Boats live the shores full of petrol barrels without any crew members noticing a thing? How can the Joker blow out an entire Hospital despite announcing it? Can someone explain the strategy of Police Commissioner Gordon who pretends to be dead so that the Joker will focus on Harvey Dent instead? Why is Harvey Dent mad at Police Commissioner Gordon and Batman more so than mad at the Joker? Would you? Why is Batman endorsing the crimes for Harvey Dent? Couldn't Gordon and Batman agree to use the Joker as Scapegoat? I know it seems like I am writing the 'Cantique' of Nitpicking but there are way too much small incoherent things in the plot to make the whole film stands on logical ground. Christopher Nolan wanted to redefine the notion of Hero by proving that there isn't such thing as PerfectionThe Dark Knight proves if need be that everybody has flaws. Batman has flaws he has a dark side. The bright shining knight, Harvey Dent has flaws. Both of them can become as dark as they were shining onceBut are we ready to be confronted with the dark side of our Knights? Are we ready to rage War on Terror? Are we ready to give away some of our Freedom? Things will get worst before they get better. But during those darken days our very Society will be at stake. Christopher Nolan did a very good job in refreshing the Batman Series. Certainly I liked the job he did with the first one, encapsulating the film's Mythology in some kind of possible contemporary Reality. But too much is too much. Here it appears ridicule at best, chocking sometime and often incoherent. As a director scaring people is an easy thing to do. Depicting the process of Fear is way more difficult. Time of hardship is here. We don't know where we're going and it's quite something to live in fear. We need a light, we need Knights. But do we need darken Knights? One thing for sure, there are no 'Shining Knights'... So at the very least we need to understand how fear transforms into courage sometimes and how the control of this courage and the course of action are important and can't lie in the hand of one Man or a few. The problem is, Batman 'The Dark Knight' lacks any understanding of the danger of Fear. Whether it is the Fear of one Man or the Fears of a given Society",6,8,15,18 August 2008
The Last Samurai," Falling in the 'visual over substance' trap...once again
","'The Last Samurai' is the ultimate Hollywood machinery to make you fall in the trap of mediocrity without you noticing it...the weapons used are classic once: cheesiness, unrealistic story, pretty pictures, robotic pace, pop corn and coke environment. Your are entertained, some of us will spare some tears in front of this well produced eye for candy film... but at the end this is nothing more than a straight formula very well hidden under a beautiful cinematography... SPOILERWhat's the recipe's like? Chapter one: 'Honor to be restored' The film start with an extremely corny opening narration where we learn that Japanese 'forgot the very meaning of the word honor.' - 5 minutes into the movie and we've already reached the paroxysm of pretension. Chapter Two: 'Japanese Strategy' A drunkard is hired by a nation who wants to build a modern army. - Do Mrs. Zwick / Cruise want to prove that Japanese people are silly, because if that's what they wanted they're spot on. Chapter Three: 'The definition of courage': Tom Cruise gets beaten up by that Japanese Samurai guy, but refuses to stay down - What kind of courage is that? I did not know that the words courage and stupidity were synonyms. Chapter Four: 'I am the polyglot' During the only time Katsumoto and the Emperor met they choose to speak English rather than Japanese. - Was it an English contest between the two of them? Chapter Five: 'A Samurai is born' Tom Cruise mastered the katana during one winter. He now can kill 3 Ninjas who trained all their life and kills 5 armed Japanese swordsmen in Kyoto's street in a beautiful and polished to the extreme samurai showdown. Chapter Six: 'Men of Courage' Katsumoto and is fellow samurai charge at the machine guns. The scene is so breath taking that the Japanese officer is feeling sympathy for them and everyone is now showing 'mucho respecto' for the guys. - We reached a peak right there where ridicule and stupidity are blend in a 'Hollywoody Superb'. Final Chapter: 'Honor Restored' or 'The lesson from the drunkard': A broken Tom Cruise handing Katsumoto's sword to the Emperor and saying the following line 'I won't tell you how he died. I will tell you how he lived.' - Now I am p***ed of as the use of clichÃ©s has reached the top of 'Cheesy Mountain'.I will pass on the detail of the perfect Japanese village were everything is clean from the stone to the roof top. I am actually wandering if the dirt and the trees were bacteria free as the village seems cleaner than Michael Jackson's oxygen caisson. Once again Hollywood is serving us a 'ready to feel' beautifully shot and well produced film...hoping that we will fall once again in their 'visual over substance' trap - I almost did please don't...",6,1,2,11 March 2004
From Hell," A beautiful picture, a powerful plot, a disappointing film
","'From Hell' is another Jack the ripper movie. It is the 4th movie of the Hughes brothers (after Menace II Society in 93, Dead President in 95 and American Pimp in 99). It is also the most accomplished one from a technical stand point. Finally it is a fairly good adaptation of the novel by Alan Moore. The movie match the pace, the atmosphere and the style of the novel. The only good difference is that in the movie, you follow the investigation through inspector Frederick George Abberline's eyes (Johnny Depp), meaning you don't know who Jack the ripper is until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The picture of 'From Hell' is very well set. The lightning and the shadows of London streets (even though it was filmed in Prague) are a piece of work. The realization is almost perfect: from the authenticity of this White Chapel district down to the very detail of the costumes, the work achieved here is truly impressive. The overall atmosphere is tainted with Gothic effects which ad to the power of some scenes. The sound of the movie is also very well worked, from the carriages wheels to the sound of the footstep over London's pavement. However the movie remain disappointing. The acting and the dynamic of the characters are superficially done. If Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow, 1999)was pretty descent and Ian Holm (remember him as Ash in Alien 1979 or in the Chariots of Fire in 1981) gave (almost as usual) a great performance, Heather Graham (Austin Powers, 1999) never emerged from the plot. She should have become the obsession of both Jack the ripper and inspector Abberline. Unfortunately most of this dynamic is underplayed. As a result the movie suffers from a lack of suspense (you just never get scared). There is almost no tension and little by little the movie becomes a pure artistic exercise leaving the cinematographic experience being a minor objectives (it should be the other way around!!!). The Hughes brothers managed to make a beautiful movie, unfortunately they also manage to make a scary movie non-scary and a powerful story unpowerful.

Blade Runner," Between Sci-Fi Thriller and 'Film Noir', a masterpiece.
","Ridley Scott was 45 years old when his fifth movie was released in 1982. After 19 years of public life 'Blade Runner' is considered a 'cult movie' transcending the genre becoming a classic. The plot may seem a little bit simple at first sight however 'Blade Runner' raises some of the most fundamental questions flirting with existentialism as well as humanism. If the movie was inspire by Philip K. Dick's novel: 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep', the realization of the scenario differed completely. The story takes place in a dark and urban near future where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford best role) is a blade runner, a cop and has been asked to retire/kill 4 replicants who escaped from an obscure space colony, have hijacked a space ship to return home back on earth (where they have been declared illegal) seeking for their 'maker'(the charismatic Joe Turkel). The mission turns out much more difficult than expected. The 4, soon 5 replicants are not 'computers' they are 'physical' (Human made by Human through genetic manipulation I assume). They have great intelligence and superior physical abilities and resistance. They are looking for answers and are determine to get them what ever it takes. Their questioning will become ours: What makes us human? Are we human from birth in other words by essence? Or do we become human with what we do, through what we achieve? Who is a human being? Rick Deckard who tracks down Zhora (the beautiful Joanna Cassidy) or the tragic Zhora who after a stressful hunt seems suddenly so close to us when being shot down, frozen in an everlasting slow motion made of shattering glasses. Roy Batty who discovers his own humanity when facing his last trial, the only trial he will never win: death ; or Eldon Tyrel who plays God but has forgotten to play Human? Maybe 'memories' is the clue we are looking for? But what kind of memory and whose memory? Sure my memory (personal or common) is part of what makes me act as a human being but doesn't it alienates me like a trauma alienates a patient? So love has to be the ultimate clue. But in that case what kind of love? The love that shows Deckard to Rachael (the enigmatic Sean Young) made of sarcasm and bitterness or the love shared by the powerful Roy Batty (the awesome Rutger Hauer) and the wild Pris (best role ever for Daryl Hannah)? What feeling shows more humanity? The kiss made of tears that Roy lives on Pris's cold lips. Or the one that Deckard stills from Rachael after making her uncomfortable? Ridley Scott lives the answers to each and every one of us. Once again (Alien 1979) he has created a fantastic atmosphere made of dark streets, flying cars, post modern buildings, flame burst in a black sky, everything blend in a powerful and spiritual music written by the talented Vangelis. Once again he had the right actors: Edward James Olmos as the ambiguous Gaff, William Sanderson playing the pathetic and naive J. F. Sebastian or Bryan James as the powerful and hopeless Leon. In this environment the so call humans behave like 'soulless machines' and the so call machines are searching for their soul discovering their humanity. This masterpiece is and was directed as an 'initiatic journey'. We'll understand that what we look for and what we found is ourselves.",9,1,2,27 February 2001
Lucy," Has 'Lucy' any cinematographic merit?
","Lucy, a woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal is forced to become a drug mule. But when the bag of synthetic drug she is carrying inside of her stomach leaks she transforms into a merciless warrior evolving beyond human logic and she undergoes unimaginable changes that begin to unlock her mind's full potential.The plot is far for being the most stupid plot ever in cinema (not the sharpest as well). Basically 'Lucy' is based on a simple question: can we be more than what we are? 'Limitless' from Neil Burger had the same approach by the way, brain evolution was also triggered through use of a specific drug. 'The lawnmower man' from director Brett Leonard touched upon the same subject. Even director Wally Pfister with 'Transcendence' explored that same line of questioning. 'Lucy' goes a step further as the brain evolution comes along body change and implies the next evolutions (plural) of humanity.So the problem does not reside in the promise of the film but more so in its delivery. The film is entertaining enough and did not deserve the bashing it got especially in France where I guess critics associate box office success with mediocrity in an almost systematic manner. However there are several problems in the films that makes it play in the rental category or a nice candidate for downloads (obviously legal ones). In short the film does not deserve a 10 bucks ticket.Primo character development is badly done. The main character Lucy interpreted by Scarlett Johansson balances between a blonde bimbo and an emotionally void cyborg. This binary mode does not help understand how knowledge could impact our humanity, development that could have enriched the movie and provide depth to an otherwise boring character. Having the percentage of brain use informing us of the evolving state of Lucy did not help much as there is no real logic in the progression of Lucy's powers. Eventually the treatment of Lucy's character is rather a misogynistic one despite Besson's claims about respecting women. Then comes the professor Norman portrayed by Morgan Freeman who re-prised his clichéd role of an authority figure. There is little to say except Besson needed an actor like Freeman to force on to us pseudo-scientific evidences delivered with very little conviction. As a result Morgan Freeman is severely walking thru his role and comes across as a slacker. Korean actor Min-sik Choi from 'Old boy' completes the main roles trio. His one dimensional interpretation of an Asian Drug Lord allows him to swing between extreme calm and ultra-violence and what could have been an opportunity to confront different type of humanity ends up being a collage of grotesque caricatures. Secondo the treatment of Asian people in the film may be questionable. Most if not all Asians are either cast as villains or as props to be killed for no other reason than comic relieve. Scarlett Johansson's character shoots a taxi driver simply because he can't speak English in Taiwan. In the hospital scene, she also shoots an Asian patient on the operating table in the head simply because she needs the surgeon to stitch her up. I am passing on the irrational behavior of someone getting more and more intelligent but acting in erratic ways or the fact that a tall blonde running with guns and killing everybody don't trigger any SWAT intervention. Honestly those scenes make me uncomfortable.Tertio the overall structure /editing makes me wonder if 'Lucy' was not a 15mn short that Luc Besson extended to the last drop. The film is 89mn long and is a succession of video clip like scenes cemented by a very cold 'art direction' and action scenes that appears as fillers not bringing anything much to the overall plot. A more organic feel would have been a perfect bridge between a kinetic world and a more immaterial one. Basically I would have preferred a more 'Cronenbergesque' point of view. Unfortunately the film resembles more of a glossy straight to DVD attempt that was green-lighted for the big screen in extremist. The end seems rushed and uses too much of this none organic CGI that really lower the artistic value. It's true that 'Lucy' is still packed with some creative ideas like the flashback to the dawn of universe and humanity. Some will definitely see the homage to '2001 A Space Odyssey' but even this was not acknowledged by Mr Besson. The conclusion of the film was also very disappointed; basically using 100% of our brain turns us in some omnipotent god who likes to appear as a USB flash drive, really?Well I am maybe too demanding. Here is my advice to you: use only 1% of your brain and you'll get a higher percentage of entertainment, which percentage exactly is up to you.",5,1,5,28 May 2015
300," Have we gone so mad we can not distinguish films from video games?
","For the life of me I can not understand why people would rave so much about this mockery of a movie I knew I was not going to see an accurate historical film. I knew I was in for a graphic novel adaptation. But what I witnessed was a simplification of already simplified and false historical facts. The result is catastrophic.Obviously it is easier to show 'real Spartan warriors' not indulged in a fair amount of man love. But guess what they were Obviously it is easier to show Persians as decadent, uncivilized, unsophisticated and without any understanding of military strategyBut guess what the Persian Empire established by Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, was the most magnificent and civilized empire in 480 B.C. Obviously it is easier and convenient to imply that Greece won against Persia at the naval battle of Artemisium. But guess what, historically, the Greeks lost that naval battle as well. Obviously it is easier to define bravery as 300 Spartans warriors fighting against a million Persians. But guess what they were more like 10000 Spartans, Athenians, Thebans, Thespians and Phoceans against 200,000 Persians. Obviously it is easier to represent Xerxès the first as a giant homosexual, piercing adept. But guess what he was more like a sophisticated Persian and also a great military strategist. Obviously it is easier to make War and Killing the glorious thing a nation could ever accomplish. But guess what there is no Glory in War and Killing. Only Death Obviously it is easier to make a baseless action movie rather than a real epic 'peplum'. An action movie staged in an imaginary Time and Place with imaginary heroes and villains. But guess what great movies are not easy to make, great movies are based upon a tangible scenario and everything else is aimed to support that scenario. Some of us applaud the aesthetic of the film as I refuse to call it cinematography. But for me the glossy, saturated bronze color like background looked incredibly unrealistic. Some of us feel shiver down their spines when hearing talks of freedom' and 'justice' coming out of King Leonidas, Gerard Butler's mouth. But for me it sounded more like an unintentional satire of America misadventure in Iraq. Some of us cheer at the slick fighting scenes and rejoice when Zack Snyder's camera abuses slow motions in order for the audience to enjoy the slaughtering. But for me that was the paroxysm of emptiness and the moment I felt lectured by a mediocre director as to why violence, racism, sadism are surprisingly virtues to be cherished. Some of us raise their arms in the air and wave at the ripped muscled Spartan men. But for me those leather pants Greek Warriors fighting thousands of ninjas almost died of ridicule. Some of us enjoy metal music mixed with 'Gladiatoresque' chants. But for me it was noise and a sign that the film triggers 15 year old disturbed American boys who think Leonidas is a brand of chocolate and Xerxès an upcoming video game. It's fine to make movies out of comics. It's fine to make violent films. It's also fine to use CGI in order to display thing you could not without. Eventually it is fine to fantasy an historical period. But make no mistake there is nothing groundbreaking or breathtaking in 300. As there is no soul in this film only fleshAs there are no story only eventsAs there is no cinematography only computerized backgroundAs there is no feeling only fading impressionThis is virtual at its worst. What's best to erase a virtual film? I suggest we all make a virtual fire in our mind in which we'll burn 300. And maybe the flames will be so big it will enlighten Hollywood once and for all...",4,136,244,29 March 2007
The Thin Red Line," The battle is inside the enemy is ourselves...
","Terrence Malick is not a famous director. Few things are known about this man and in 35 years he only has directed 5 movies. In Hollywood not directing a lot is generally not a good sign. But Mr. Malick is unlike any other director and his films are unlike any other films. When 'Badlands' opens it was said to be the first film since Citizen Kane, where a director is so in control. Except maybe from Mr. Stanley Kubrick or Mr. Sergio Leone few directors control their creation as much as Mr. Malick. Basically what you see on screen is what he wants you to see. And with the 'Thin Red Line' what we see and what we experience are beyond the pictureas the film takes place in our mindWar movies or anti-war movies for that matter have been a major genre in cinema and they all share a lot of similarities (battle scenes, sense of adventure, History and patriotism etc).'The Thin Red Line' is not about battle scenes; it is not about adventure and or patriotism and is not an historical movie in the sense that Guadalcanal historical background is only used as a set, a stage. Still 'The Thin Red Line' is about fight, the worse fight ever experienced the most horrible one and the most life changing one. The fight takes place inside and outside, in our soul and all around. In the 'The Thin Red Line' Mr. Malick depicts a battle against the devil within and against events no longer in our control. This is the trial of Death, the fear of it or even the excitement from it. This trial is unfair in nature and physical battle is only a revealer that the trial has begun (e.g. the attack of the hill). During this trial our profound 'animality' and humanity will be exposed to everybody but more importantly to ourselves. The events / elements are taking their revenge. Men lost in the center of a conflict that they (themselves) have created can't control the course of the rage. And why can't they? Just because the dogs of war can never be controlled once they have been unleashed. On one hand the soldiers are lost in the jungle; it seems that nature is not going to be an ally. On the other hand the Melanesians autochthons commune with their environment like they are part of it. This contrast is re-enforced by the music, the noise of hell is made of machine guns and mortars firing bullets (war) and the music of heaven is made of enchanting Melanesians songs (peace) Is Mr. Malick giving us a lesson? Not really. Since 'All Quiet in the Western Front' we know that war is not glamorous. What Mr. Malick reminds us (in case we forget this wide spread truth) is that we are alone and in front of Death we are even more so. The wife of Ben Chaplin (Private Jack Bell) is a reminder of this fact. Through his camera, Mr. Malick succeeds in isolating the person. Death (given or taken) is no longer a collective faith but an individual one and the phrase of Private First Class Doll 'I kill a man' echoes in our head like an alarm clock forever plugged to our brain.Serves with an outstanding cinematography from John Toll and an impressive cast if not perfect, the 'Thin Red Line' is one of the most thought provoking film I have seen in years. Some people might call it pretentious wellpretension is when perfection has not been achieved. I personally call it masterpiece",8,4,8,4 March 2005
