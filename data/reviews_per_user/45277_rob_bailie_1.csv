Blade Runner 2049," What the . . . . .
",CGI is impressive but for the love of christ how boring is this film? It gets one point for the CGI and another point for having Harrison Ford in it.I'm more impressed that I actually sat through the whole film and it still doesn't give any closure which has to be one of the most irritating things about the film.If you enjoyed the first Blade Runner then don't bother watching this it brings nothing new to the table.Google Bladerunner 2049 runtime and move on to watch something else.,2,3,5,30 August 2019
