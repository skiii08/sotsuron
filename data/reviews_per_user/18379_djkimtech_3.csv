Your Name.," Jaw dropping animation, but may not turn anime-non-believers
","This is a really sweet film. This anime has one of the most vibrant color palettes I have ever seen on screen and its animation clearly was worked on with a lot of hard work. To top it, the plot is really sappy and kind of melodramatic, but I don't think this necessarily hurts the film. People who love slice-of-life/romantic animes will get a kick out of this film, but I can't promise others that they will appreciate it as much since the third act does drag on and the use of music is a bit excessive creating a feeling of disingenuous drama.For me, I did tear up a bit. The hand-painted cells are just amazing and I can be a sucker for sappy romance. And the plot does give something to the audience member to engage on. If I was a bigger fan of anime and was more tolerable of the 'Anime Music Video' vibes I was getting from this film, I might have rated it higher. I implore everyone to give this film a try and hopefully you'll get more out of this film than I did.",7,0,0,17 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A Great Closing for the Fans
","Please keep in mind that this score is coming from a person who is NOT a fan and that this is still a generally positive review.For the first time for me, I must credit the Disney front office, and especially Feige, for pulling off one of the most ambitious projects in film history. It has become clear to me that this entire 22 Marvel movie series beginning with Iron Man was taken very seriously by everyone involved, and while I respect the directors' visions for each movie, having the oversight over the entire Marvel project was what really made the franchise an unprecedented success.Now that being said, onto the movie itself. I'll avoid spoilers, so I'll just say I came out feeling just whelmed for this movie. Unlike Infinity War, Endgame felt more like the typical Marvel movie to me, and that means for negatives it suffered from some pacing issues for the sake of exposition, its music especially during more lowkey scenes felt uninspired, and emotional scenes felt very subdued due to some directorial choices, whereas Infinity War did a lot to cut fat and, perhaps due to its position being 2nd to last chronologically, had some actual impactful scenes.For Endgame specifically, there was a 'thing' about it that also felt very out of place in contrast to what the tone was (if you've seen the movie you'll know what I'm talking about).But with these negative points in mind, there were some VERY gratifying scenes, both for those Marvel fans (which I didn't care too much about) and for those who understand what kind of expectations this film needed to meet. And because of these scenes and their execution, I didn't feel cheated out of an ending and I can understand why fans would cry.Congratulations Marvel fans, it's very rare that a fanbase can see their media being remade to still meet their high demands, and I think Marvel has done it for you guys.Just please keep discussion open though. Just because someone doesn't feel as strongly as you do does not mean they disrespect your opinion; some people enjoy asking the tough questions to get to a deeper truth.",6,2,9,29 April 2019
Incredibles 2," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","TL;DR While this film is visually and aurally appealing in Pixar standards, this film drops a lot of the aspects that made the original Incredibles unique in favor of a more box office friendly approach.As a preface, I adored the first Incredibles growing up, and after re-watching it in preparation for this film, I still adore it. So, this review will carry some bias, because I think the Incredibles 2 is a perfectly OK film by itself. What this film has going is its updated visuals, interesting and engaging action scenes, and music; or in general its aesthetic. Originally Director Brad Bird wanted the visuals of the Incredibles to mimic that of those Golden Age-Superhero posters back in the 50s/60s, and while the first film did a great job in context to what technology was available, this sequel nails it. The skyscrapers were massive and follow the simple geometry of modernist architecture, the trains, cars, and other vehicles were all futuristic in a modernist sense (again), the music while not so different from the original film was still magnificent and brassy, and the action was very impressive and flashy whereas the original film didn't have too many opportunities to show off this sort of choreography. And while the plot, characters, and script were meh, without the context of the original this film is a perfectly OK 5/10 and a perfect rental if you want to appreciate the high quality artistic direction that Pixar produces.Now that being said, this film loses almost all the magic the original had. To keep this readable, I'll just mention two of the most annoying aspects of the film but be sure I had other qualms with this film and you can find most of them in other reviews.The first aspect is line delivery. In re-watching the original, I noticed how snappy, quick, and sticky the dialogue was. Most people I know have at least memorized 2 scenes from the original and I can almost guarantee YOU the reader know the super suit scene by heart. Now how many lines from the Incredibles 2 can you recite? Maybe the 'Math is Math' line but that might be it. One part of why this is because the voice actors who weren't in the original did not follow the cadence and speed that original voice actors, the most blatant violator being the voice actor for Void. Instead of sounding like someone who is a part of this 50s/60s-quick talking world, her nervous west coast girl delivery sounds sorely out of place like the picture of the time-travelling hipster. The closest voice actor to get to the delivery was Bob Odenkirk, but even he would sound out of place if he was casted in the original film and kept the same delivery. This aspect is hard to explain in words and this is more of guttural reaction to the dialogue, but hopefully if you re-watch the original you can tell too. The other aspect was how much this film just felt so standard. It has X number of action scenes, it has Y number of funny scenes, it needed to have 5 Jack Jack scenes, etc etc. The magic of the first film was how reserved the animation was to let the character designs, subtle facial animation, and dialogue shine. It is amazing how re-watchable the First Act is being it was primarily in a gray office building. There are so many scenes in the original Incredibles that were shot-reverse shot. A true sign of a director following an inspired vision to the end. What about the Incredibles 2? It relies heavily on a compilation of scenes that halt the progress of the plot to produce oohs, aahs, and laughter (talking to you Jack Jack, raccoon, and Edna) instead of quality scenes that can do the same (albeit less flashy) and give us insight into characters and conflicts.Overall, I cannot discredit the Incredibles 2 too much for these aspects because these aspects are what I got from the original, me alone. If you want to watch a 3D animated movie with your family, go ahead and pop this on your living room screen, but if you want to watch a movie like the Incredibles, you will probably be disappointed.",4,5,17,18 August 2018
