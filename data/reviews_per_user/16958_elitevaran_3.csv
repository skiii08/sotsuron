Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A disappointing and tasteless film
","For being the most hyped film of its time, You would hope that a film like this would be somewhat satisfying, But in reality this was arguably one of the biggest occurrences where fans would be disappointed. And I believe most of the sheer hype for this film was the fact that It was a George Lucas film, who brought the impacting and hugely popular idea 'Star Wars' to the world back in May of 1977.But does this film live up to its hope? No. Not at all.The premise of this 'new trilogy' is to to follow the story of Anakin Skywalker, who later becomes the iconic movie villain, Darth Vader. Now this idea in general isn't bad, Since it would be difficult to follow what would happen after Episode 6, and would definitely take lots of time, thinking and effort. But the glaring issue with this prequel storyline is that it only seems impactful and interesting until Episode 3.With that said, the film isn't remotely entertaining. Its way of putting things together seems sloppy and looks much more like filler and a marketing move than actual lore, But the lackluster characters don't help much at all.Most of the characters that appear in this film are not memorable or likable at all, theirs characters like Qui Gon who only seem to slow things down, Characters like Jar Jar who seems to be a failed marketing subject, and just comes down to look like 'forced humor' that the fans has since just found annoying.Another glaring issue is its heavy political dialogue. Now since this movie is mainly aimed at new generations of future Star Wars, this film decides to bore the ENTIRE audience with political dialogue, Which doesn't seem to fit at all, which shortens the attention span of the viewers who are watching Star Wars, not a CNN Broadcast who are covering today's news on the state of modern society.The enemies, or antagonists that are in the film aren't that bad. The droids, the Separatist ground forces could've been threatening,Mainly because of the standard troopers spouting random dialogue like 'Roger Roger!' In high pitched voices of them really rule down their intimidation. I wish they would be more like Terminators, not quite exactly like them, but more the ruthlessness and almost unstoppable features, which would make them seem like an actual threat. However the types of machinery like the Destroyer Droids are actually really creative and well made. I also really like the fact that Palpatine's true motives are a mystery and his plot to rule the galaxy is growing, To me this is one of the best features of the prequels, It's almost like he is the overall embodiment of the Dark Side. Darth Maul, the apprentice of Palpatine had potential, But didn't have very many screen-time at all, which sucked.A aspect that isn't necessary is the movie taking place while Anakin is an 8 year old boy. If they were to make him a little older his overall character would be more relate-able and interesting, Which is one of the things Episode 4 did so well with Luke. Anakin didn't even have to be Luke's age, he could've been a at least a little older so he would mold with the overall story much better.The film also has trouble with scenes that seem out of place, or just there for added marketing, Which is very aggravating. For example, we have the Famous pod-racing segment, Which Anakin volunteers to do since the winning payment will allow the protagonists to buy another hyper- drive system, which is their ticket out of the Outer Rim. But this is clearly there sourly for the purpose of making Video Games based on this specific scene. And Anakin accidentally destroying a CIS control ship just seems unrealistic and strange.The use of CGI in this movie is mediocre in a sense that sometimes its used right and sometimes it doesn't seem necessary. For example, the CG effects helped enhance the Lightsaber battles, they look more fluent and are much more entertaining to watch. But some of the different species look just awful because of their CG.The Final act somewhat borrows what Episode 6 did, having the final act having different things going on. It worked well for Episode 6 but here it seems like there is too much going on.The only one of these I found fitting was the duel with Darth Maul. Its the best part of this film. Its one of the only scenes that is honestly enjoyable. The Track 'Duel of the Fates' that goes with it is simply incredible. Its powerful orchestra elements and the sheer power of the chorus makes this one of the greatest tracks in film history, And i'm not kidding.And this leads me to my final point with this film, Its incredible musical score by John Williams himself, who's music actually improved the films scenes and movie itself. Without John Williams score, this film would be almost nothing.Overall, Though its flaws may be evident It can be enjoyable, since its Star Wars after all. But if your looking for a superb Star Wars experience, skip this one. But if your looking for something to watch, then give this one a shot. Its not exactly good, but it certainly has its moments.",5,1,5,4 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," My favorite film of 2015
","Sometimes, the most hyped movie ends up being the worst. There however, is that handful of Directors that you can just say 'this film is in good hands'The Force Awakens has a wonderful feel to it, and is overall a entertaining and a masterpiece of a film. At first, i was worried. Mainly because most good movies have a good start and once when the other Directors try to get in with the success, they mostly ruin it. The Force Awakens, however is something different.JJ Abrams added new characters that have great potential, and have have launched some of their acting careers. But they also have the famous old characters that we know and love, characters we haven't seen in the franchise since 1983.Its the little things like seeing Han Solo pilot the Millennium Falcon again since 32 years, and all of the memorable quotes being used to make the adults feel like kids again.People don't find Kylo Ren very interesting and cool, but i happen to see potential in his character and i look forward to seeing him more in the Franchise, a wonderful antagonist as well as Captain Phasma and General Hux.I don't want to give too much away, because all of this needs to be watched, not read.Overall, the Force Awakens exceeded my expectations, and caused me to go see it again, something i don't usually do. It is an outstanding movie that should've won an academy award or two, because it sure as hell deserved some.",9,3,27,2 June 2016
Godzilla," Mediocre
","Being a Godzilla fan a large portion of my life, i looked forward to this immensely. I thought to myself 'Godzilla is finally in good hands..' But.. that is somewhat not true now. The main issue of this film is how little they pay attention to Godzilla. How many scenes, you might wonder. Well he is on screen 8 minutes. And this is a two hour long movie. They didn't need to 'introduce' him. He was well introduced for 60 years. In the trailers, they teased him. Which i can see, But they continue to tease him even in the film. Which is flat out ridiculous.The enemy monster is brand new, freshly created. And this begins with the films second issue. They spend a HUGE majority of the movie talking about these things. We all came to see Godzilla, not MUTO'S vs Godzilla.The film would have worked 80% percent better if it was JUST Godzilla. And if it actually fitted the dark and cold atmosphere of the Trailers. Which the Trailers displayed a dark and depressing tone, which should of been the entire film on its own. That would work perfect.. and it would might of been Oscar winning.On the bright side, The times when Godzilla does show up, Its amazing. This Godzilla is the biggest one yet (stands at 108 meters). And is spectacular to see in theaters.Godzilla has his atomic breath, too. Thank god.The only good actor in the film is Bryan Cranston. You really feel the pain he is going through and he expresses his emotions in such a realistic way. Everybody else's acting is lacking.The last flaw i have is Godzilla's nature. He ends up in this film to be the 'balance of nature' But Godzilla should be the enemy. Having Godzilla a hero is just awkward. Sure he has saved Japan a number of times, But here he is pure Hero.quick recap:CONS:-Godzilla lacks a massive amount of screen time-Acting is bland-Too much attention to the MUTO -Godzilla is a pure Hero -Constant teasingPROS:-Godzilla looks better than ever -He has his Atomic Breath -Soundtrack is awesome-Bryan Cranston -Director has respect to original designs/films/conceptsPretty much, this was a film worth seeing in theaters. Okay to some fans, but most critics won't like it. Hopefully the 2018 sequel with Mothra/Rodan/Ghidorah will be good because they are done 'introducing' him.",6,1,3,27 April 2016
