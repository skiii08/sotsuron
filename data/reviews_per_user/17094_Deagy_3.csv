Lucky Number Slevin," Best Movie Of The Year So Far
","I have to say, I went to see the Hills Have Eyes, but ended up seeing this instead. It had a good cast, but I had an inkling it would be atrocious. Man Alive, How wrong was I!? The previous reviewer (yes Claire from Brighton, that's you!) must have been blind and deaf because I found it exceptionally difficult to pick a fault in the film. Fast, Witty and funny dialogue really make the 2 hours fly in. The plot, granted, was confusing in the middle, but everything came together perfectly towards the end. Perfect casting throughout, Liu and Freeman and Kingsley all give some fine performances, Hartnett suits being the protagonist with all odds against him and Bruce Willis breaks from the mould of playing the same character in every damn film he's in, so he gets points for that. Brilliant ending and opening as well.So please, don't pay any attention to the negative reviews, this film is excellent, and you really get more than you paid for.Go Now.NOW!",9,2,10,13 March 2006
Silent Hill," Holy Crap!
","FINALLY, a good horror movie for 2006! Not only that, but a good video game movie! I'm ecstatic that Uwe Boll kept his distance from this one, because the final product is just brilliant. Scary, but not in a cheap, jumpy way, but in a way that the film will crawl under your skin, then stay there.Atmospheric, Gory, Nasty, Confusing, it's exactly like the games, and really faithful! As a huge fan, I was very very pleased. It has all that I wanted in it : Dahlia, Alessa, the Nurses, Lisa Garland, God and Pyramid Head!! An excellent movie (dodgy ending) and a generally faithful adaptation, try it out! (but not for a first date movie!)",9,0,2,23 April 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Where Did It All Go Wrong?
","I was so so psyched to be seeing this movie, the trailer looked promising, as did the initial reviews, and all this talk of dismemberment, rape, gore and tension got my hopes up. But unfortunately, The Hills Have Eyes went downhill from the opening scene.Alexandre Aja's Switchblade Romance was actually one of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen, perfect on every account. But The Hills Have Eyes was an unimaginable let-down for me. The opening scene was neither scary nor gory, just plain ridiculous. This trend continued throughout the movie. It was just pointless gore, followed by more pointless gore and some strange stunts. Most ridiculous was the fact that a 15/16 (?) year old could make up a security system in the middle of a scorching desert, on his own, without hindrance, it made the movie laughable.This movie was meant to be sick and disgusting and scarring. It wasn't. It was good FX and VERY LOUD NOISES every 30 seconds. It lacked any tension, atmosphere, or chemistry between the characters. The decision not to show the rape scene or the older sister getting shot in the head was a bad decision, because it leaves little else to merit the 18 certificate, and left the audience bored.It had a few good points, the body part box was good, as was the music. But that's it...Clich√©d, Over Hyped, Loud and often Pointless, the Hills Have Eyes 2006 is just a wasted opportunity.4/10",6,0,1,18 March 2006
