The Ring," Scariest film I have ever seen...
","I'm going to keep this short, I just went to see the preview screening in London. My friend who I went with spent a good portion of the film screaming and burying her head in my shoulder. I have bruises on my arm from where she was grabbing me so hard.The start of the film is sort of Scream-esque - probably on purpose to get you off guard...'just another teen horror film'After that...well.. heh just go watch it....if you think Event Horizon was scary...this is to the power of ten...
