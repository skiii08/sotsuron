First Man," Claustrophobic, panic-inducing movie
","Thanks to the 'brilliance' of the camerawork, I have just discovered that I am prone to claustrophobic attack even in a cinema hall, something that has never happened to me before. This was the first time I had to walk out from the theatre hall due to a shortness of breath induced by the claustrophobic camerawork (darkness, closeups, fuzziness) combined with extreme, unbearable sounds. 
If the idea was to simulate an astronaut's experience and make the viewer physically and emotionally uncomfortable for the entire duration of the movie, then perhaps there should be some soft of a disclaimer that helps people decide whether or not they want to expose themselves to this kind of experience. The most annoying thing is that this is the style of the entire movie, not just of the few scenes in the outer space. So you cannot just wait for the claustrophobic scene to be over - even the scenes that are supposed to be normal are done in the same ridiculous manner.",1,47,83,17 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Highly Overrated
","This movie has a surprisingly high rating, given its extremely simple storyline and lack of imagination (the monsters look like alien species seen in countless science fiction and horror movies). The idea of using silence, whispering and limited dialogue throughout the movie appears original at first, but its effect quickly fades, and fails to build momentum. At times, the movie resembles a family drama more than a horror story.",6,3,5,31 May 2018
Mother!," A masterpiece!
","The movie is extraordinary on multiple levels. It is an utterly disturbing and transfixing psychological horror, with amazing scenography and superb acting (both Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Berdem are great in their roles). Not just the story, but each scene is dense with symbolism and remains open to interpretation); it is perhaps gradually earning its status of one more cult film of Darren Aronofsky. Only if one strips this movie off its rich allegorical essence, it is possible to misunderstand the movie as being bizarre or weird. It is a masterpiece!",9,0,1,31 May 2018
