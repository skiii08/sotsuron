Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars 1 3D review
","Episode 1 is the weakest of the 6, but Darth Maul and the Pod Race are great! I still feel that this movie is way too underrated. What irritates me is the 3D! I took my friend to see it 'cause he never saw 3D. He didn't really notice anything, and I hate it more! I read why Roger Ebert hates 3D. I moved the 3D glasses off repeatedly and noticed that the 3D makes the overall image so congested and gloomy! I love the theater experience and I tried to give 3D many chances, but I think there is no hope for it! I was impressed for about 14 seconds and irritated for about 2 hours! And all those Lucas changes that he ever did won't add up to the 2 hour congested gloom of 3D!! I'm done with it! Its all about money! Higher ticket prices! Even this hated movie made over 20 mill over the weekend, too bad 3D wont go away! I like the movie and hate the 3D. I think 3D is the worse thing than all of the changes that Lucas could ever do to the films!Drag me by gunpoint and I'll go to the other films!",1,6,13,13 February 2012
Godzilla," Where is Godzilla? Get the people out of the way!
","The Godzilla film is very people oriented! I wanted to see Godzilla. If the Movie poster showed a closeup of the young guy and have Godzilla in the background, I would not have been disappointed.I already read that you wouldn't see Godzilla until the 1 hour mark. 'Jaws' did that and was a masterpiece. I thought this would be suspenseful and have a good buildup. I was wrong. Just as you start to 'get into it', it cuts and goes to another scene. The actors all did a good job, but the film should have made them secondary and not primary. It is not a bad movie though. It just does not live up to the trailers or even that funny car commercial that are strangely more entertaining than the film itself?",5,5,9,19 May 2014
