The Sound of Music," Two thumbs up!
","Oh how I love this movie! It's one of my favorites. I have seen this both on stage, and on my home screen. It is one, WONDERFUL movie AND musical. I love how uplifting it is, and even with some drama in it, it has a happy ending. I own the new anniversary DVD that just came out, and the soundtrack, which I hope to keep for eternity. Julie Andrews is still amazing, and so is the rest of the cast. The lyrics are astounding, and so colorful. I really suggest this movie to all that enjoy musicals, and who want to learn a little bit on history as well. Trust me on this, rent the movie. Your home television screen, will truly come alive, with the sound of music.",10,2,8,3 December 2005
