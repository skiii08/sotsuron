Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A lot Better then People give it Credit for
","I'll be the first to admit that The Phantom Menace (TPM from here on in)is not a perfect film, but there is no way it deserves the thrashing it gets in the media. TPM is a very good film, and George Lucas is brilliant man who despite what many have said has not lost his directing skills over the years. He presents the story of Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader) in his his youth and how he is discovered by Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and brought to the capital planet of Corruscant to begin his Training.  To make the film more exiting and to introduce new characters, the Film also deals with a Trade dispute involving The planet of Naboo and the Trade Federation, which serves as the final battle in the film.I can't believe how bashed this film gets, yes its not as good as the original trilogy, but TPM is much better than the 'over CGI Video-game' looking Attack of the clones(AOTC). The performances are very well done, Ewan MacGregor has minimum screen time, but he does fine as does Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Liam Neeson (who is the star of the film), The CGI is just the right amount for the film, its not fake looking or over used as AOTC showed us and the Story is very interesting, this film takes place before the Empire as taken over in the Original Trilogy and before the clone war conflict of AOTC, so this is the only Star Wars film to show us what the galaxy was like during peaceful times. Also, it should be viewed with an open mind, Don't sit down to watch this film expecting to learn every secret and hidden meaning in the other Star wars films (that will be left to AOTC and episode 3). Enjoy it for what it is, a fun adventure film that sets up the events in the following 5 films.8/10 stars",9,88,171,24 June 2003
The Patriot," One of the best epics of all time
","Unfortunately (like most people), i missed 'The Patriot' when it was first released, however i have since 'found it' on DVD.  I must say that this movie is really good, all of the performances are excellent, and the story (while borrowing a bit from brave heart) is still really good, and entertaining.In order to enjoy this movie, there are two things you have to remember:1.  Although it is set in the American Revolution it is a movie and not meant to be 100% historically accurate (little hint, its a movie, not a documentary, enjoy it as entertainment, not a history lesson).2.  Get the idea of 'Braveheart in America' out of your head, it will only ruin the movie for you (for the main reason that not many films can live up to Braveheart, similar to comparing 'the Phantom Menace to The Empire Strikes Back, you can't compare with perfection). Besides Mel Gibson and the final battle, the two movies have little in common.I would recommend 'the patriot' to anyone who wants to see a well written, well acted, well shot (especially the battle scenes) movie.  So free up some time (it clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes)and give the patriot a well deserved watch.10 out of 10 stars",10,0,3,19 July 2002
