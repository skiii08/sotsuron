Ghost," Fantastic
","The first time I saw this movie, I was perhaps five. I don't remember it clearly, but my mother says that I cried my eyes out at the ending, saying 'he should have stayed with her!' Well, I just watched Ghost again, for the first time since then. History repeated itself, and left me sobbing into my pillow. Ghost is a wonderfully touching love story, and the chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore makes the story believable and much sadder. It's a beautiful movie - sad, but beautiful - and I recommend it to men and women alike.",10,6,7,6 January 2001
Dirty Dancing," So it's not Casablanca...so what?
","Yes, this movie isn't Casablanca. It's not Romeo and Juliet, or any of those so-called 'classics'. But so what? It's a fantastic movie, and a great love story. It's got a good cast, good music, a wonderful ending...this is one of my favorite movies. It's not a guy movie by any means, it's definitely a chick flick. But all in all, even though maybe some of the dialogue is a little cheesy, and the basic plot - good girl falls for (semi) bad boy, daddy doesn't approve - has been used a million times, and will be used a million more, it still stands that Dirty Dancing is a sweet movie that never fails to make me smile.",10,1,1,4 January 2001
