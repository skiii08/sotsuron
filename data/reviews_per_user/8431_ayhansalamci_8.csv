Casablanca," A Unique Film.
","I can say that I feel the air of Casablanca, an exotic and oriental city, when I start to watch this movie which I have delayed until now with great expectation. I used a perfume from Serge Lutens, who was a perfume brand and who made the oriental perfumes, and I started to watch this film. I think it's unnecessary to criticize this film and cut the score. I think the cause is enough for the year. I think this movie, which was shot in the years when the second world war is going on, is the best love movie of all time. I think it's a movie that everyone should experience. ''We are trying to be in love when the world is going to ruin''",10,1,1,8 February 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," An Amazing Movie.
",I watched a great acting. It's impossible to create an emotional bond with movie characters. The director has done a very successful job on this issue. The best cold war movie I've ever watched.,9,2,2,30 January 2018
Gandhi," Great Story Of A Great Man.
","Gandhi is a person who has won the hearts of people with his life vision and philosophy. There's so much to say about her. I think it's a great pioneering biography. The film has the most crowded scene of cinema history. I want to congratulate the movie actors and especially Ben Kingsley. He gave more than the role he played. I want to finish with Gandhi's terrific promise.

Get Out," A Strong Movie!
","I have read many criticisms that this film is a simple film, and I do not agree with these comments. Critics made under the name of racism were beautiful. Tension and comedy together.",7,15,28,27 January 2018
The Elephant Man," A Terrific Movie!
","''Why are people afraid of the 'unknown' ?''
I was very touched. I liked it the acting of Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt very much. I'm surprised that John did not get an Oscar. 
We see our prejudice is always a shadow. Unlike other Lynch films at a more understandable level.

Call Me by Your Name," An Impressive Work Of Art.
","'The secret of a happy life is respect. Respect for yourself and respect for others.' At first I really liked the quality of the shots. A film that you can feel calm, peaceful and have a lot of emotions. Every human being lives as he wants, and the greatest support against it must come from the family.'What is home? My favorite definition is 'a safe place,' a place where one is free from attack, a place where one experiences secure relationships and affirmation. It's a place where people share and understand each other. Its relationships are nurturing. The people in it do not need to be perfect; instead, they need to be honest, loving, supportive, recognizing a common humanity that makes all of us vulnerable.' I thought that he would win the best film award and Timoth√©e had to win the best actor award. I have not read the book yet, but I have learned that some brave scenes in the book are well adapted to the film. I want to talk about a few comments I see. 
I have read a few reviews that it is a film that encourages homosexuality. 
It's not a production to encourage homosexuality. I do not recommend this film to people who are prejudiced against homosexuality.'Is it better to speak or die?'",9,1,4,10 March 2018
The Big Blue," A Fascinating Film.
","The film starts with an island view in black and white Greece. Throughout the film I encounter wonderful scenes. Blue color is peaceful and watching the endless expanse of the Mediterranean is enjoyable. I was very happy for acting. 
I think that people who are interested in diving and the sea should not go on without watching. The final scene was very impressive. 
It is a very beautiful film that brings happiness and sadness together.",8,1,1,17 March 2018
Three Colors: Blue," Impressive.
","Blue, sky and sea are icons and they have a relaxing effect on human psychology. When we open our window every day or step on the street, the sky above us like an infinite dome is blue. We often see blue tones in the film. These colors that Julie confronts show her the transition to a peaceful life. In general I can say that I watched a great drama film. The use of musical stage and color is very successful. My favorite movie in the trilogy.",9,0,0,1 February 2018
