Green Book," You only win when you maintain your dignity
","God, I love every second of this movie. This movie was so well written I just can't describe this on own words. Doctor 'a black man' who face so much discrimination that I guess no one in this world should've face it. The chemistry between the driver 'a white man' and the doctor, it was so well written, SPOILERS AHEAD.Tony - Your music touches the heart doc, but how did you maintain this with such insanity.
Doctor - Tony, it's simple you only win when you maintain your dignity, you'll never win with your hands, dignity prevails everywhere and that's what I'm good at it.
Tony - You're unbelievable, doc.
This movie teaches us something very important 'We're not white enough or We're not black enough, We're humans.",10,1,4,21 March 2019
