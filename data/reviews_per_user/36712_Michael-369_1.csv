The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing Witch Story
","We were disappointed with this particular movie.  If it had been a video at home, I would have fast forwarded several times.  This is interesting as the movie delivers what we had heard about.  Three kids, a camera, a forest, and a myth.  But as it would be in real life, there were some slow boring parts. At various times you could see them doing things that weren't likely to be done.  In a movie with a bigger budget, or real life.The only redeeming part of this movie, aside from some interest due to action near the end is the premise it is based on.  That has encouraged more conversation than the movie itself.  Don't pay 8.50 CAD for the big screen, wait for video.",3,0,1,9 August 1999
