The Benchwarmers," Childish humor, yet inappropriate for children. A paradox, or just plain crap?
","I tried to watch this movie tonight, and when I say 'Tried' I am referring to the fact that it was so full of poop jokes, unfunny physical gags, horrible writing and stale acting, that I had trouble paying attention at all. The only group of people who would find this funny, believable, or interesting are small children. It is perplexing, then, why the writer would choose to include scenes where characters talk about ovulation and sex with Rob Schneider (a wholly disturbing prospect in itself). The whole thing is shoddily written too. None of the dialogue is believable, and the whole premise of it is retarded. Not only is it presumptuous to label every kid who plays Little League a bully, but no horde of kids around the globe would be interested in a bunch of middle-aged losers who used to be nerds competing against school children, and only manage to defeat them because they have some old guy who can both pitch incredibly fast and hit home runs on every swing. Yes, that's right, it's not a tale of how hopeless nerds can be trained to use their brains and heart to defeat bully athletes, it's a tale of some old guy associating himself with some so-called nerds (who are really just losers, there's a difference) and single-handedly beating on little kids.There's a reason that Jon Lovitz is doing SubWay commercials. He's an obnoxious one-dimensional joke of an actor. Seeing him on screen pretending to be an obnoxious billionaire who owns a sentient robot (yes, the movie stoops to that level), just makes me want to snap the DVD in half and go eat at Quizno's.It was interesting, however, to see how unfunny Napoleon Dynamite can be. Avoid this movie. I give it 2 stars, because it sucked marginally less than 'Sex and the Teenage Mind' and is therefore not the worst movie I've ever seen.",2,3,5,23 August 2006
