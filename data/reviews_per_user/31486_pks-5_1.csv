Child 44," Disgusting piece of Nazi propaganda.
","I've seen a lot of Cold War era propaganda flicks, and post-Cold War as well.Seems that it's only getting worse there.'The Hunt for Red October' or 'Red Dawn' had this basic nonsensical vodka-drinking and balalaika-wielding 'commie weirdos' and 'commie bad guys' look & feel. Nothing really noticeable for the uninformed viewer, even.Then came 'Enemy at the Gates' - a prime example of recycling the foulest Nazi propaganda clichés (even a Jew Commissar - amazing!) by US propaganda machine, Hollywood, CA.But still, it had some sense in plot and some actual normal people in it. So, there were lots of room for stooping much, much lower.Well, now we got that.In this masterpiece of puking Russophobic bile on screen - 100% pure Nazi clichés, complete dehumanization of Russian 'untermensch', utter racist hatred.I don't really know what else there is to say. If you somehow don't feel same way about this piece of, hm, art - you probably should call yourself a 'hillbilly' with pride.",1,50,146,15 April 2015
