"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," laughs
",I've seen this movie a few times and it was very funny! Hugo weaving was great as Anthony 'Tick' Belrose and Mitzi Del Bra. If you really want a laugh and see some wacky stuff watch this one. I would watch it if it was on TV for sure.80%,8,1,2,17 March 2002
Gremlins," Great comedy/sci-fi
","Gremlins probably is under rated, but it thourougly delivers when your looking for a comedy and a bit of tame horror(theres hardly any). Even though the little critters are evil, they are very likeable and the people who created them did a fantastic job in designing them.And in the end, after you watch it, you really will wonder if thats a possum or gremlin in the vent ;)",7,0,1,22 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thumbs up
","I think this movie is great. Great special affects, aliens and all kinds of wacky wonderful creatures such as Jar Jar Binx make this movie colourful. It was a pity they didn't show much of C3PO, but the inclusion of R2D2 was cool. The phantom dude looked impressive. And Natalie Portman did too! Can't wait for the second episode!",7,0,1,24 January 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Creepy, but fantastic!
","E.T is a great family movie to sit down and watch. I must admit the little fella from outer space does creep me out, but Steven Spielberg did a marvolous job with this movie. The special effects were fabulous for 1982 and I'm still not sure if i'll go to see the digitaly remastered one.

The 13th Warrior," Surprisingly very enjoyable.
","I thought this would be a little dodgy when i rented it on DVD. After reading the book, i was eager to see it. Very believable characters, especially Banderas as the Ibn dude. Not much 'gore' but lovely surroundings just as i imagined it in the book(well, almost!). Another Crichton novel that has turned into a great movie.77%",7,0,0,2 January 2003
Happy Gilmore," Adam Sandler at his best.
","Adam Sandler plays a hilarious role in this fun comedy. Plot is a little weak, but its covered up by funny scenes every where you look and whenever Adam Sandler is in it, you know it's going to be fun. A must if you love comedy.80%",7,1,2,21 March 2002
The Fifth Element," Youch!
",This is a movie that had heaps of special affects and make it special. Cool monsters and beings make this movie a must. Bruce Willis is at his best in the film and Luc Besson did an outstanding job. It would be good to see another movie like this because it easily is one of the movies that take the chocolates for special affects.97%,9,0,1,17 March 2002
Blade," I vant to suck your blood!
","Blade is a dark, gloomy, but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones. A bit of gore, but nothing really that bad. Wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires. Not really like buffy, because thats too tame but Blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night....thats at best viewing!87%",8,0,1,17 March 2002
The Mummy," VERY, VERY good
","The Mummy deserves more ratings than than it has now. When a mummy is woken, all hell brakes loose. Brendan Fraser plays the role of Richard 'Rick' O'Connell who is on a dig in Hamunaptra. Of course, he is the hero and must save the day from the evil Mummy who will pretty much kill almost anything that gets in his way. The special effects are impressive in this movie. The movie moves at a fast rate but is still highly recommended. The Mummy is a polished action adventure so be sure not to miss it.95%",9,0,0,16 March 2002
Home Alone," Fun for the family
","Home alone is a family movie. I played the game on NES and it was discusting. But let's not go into that. This movie was entertaining right from the start, and although I wouldn't laugh at it, it would bring a smile to my face. Eight-year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) Is good in his roll and brings a brightness to the movie. But maybe it's a bit far fetched.66%",7,0,0,17 March 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Loved it.
","*Spoilers* I thought i would enjoy it, but not as much as i did. Really, there isn't that much gore, mainly violence. Some scary parts, so kids under at least 11 or 12 probably will have nightmares if they are easily sqemish. The Special effects were pretty good, and the headless horseman looked great.
A must if you like horrors.85%",8,0,0,30 October 2002
Scary Movie 2," Not bad.
","Scary Movie 2 probably wasn't as crude as the first, but still had it's powerful moments. With some tedious moments, the jokes are predictable, and some re-used, but you still have a laugh. The acting is actually better than some other movies, and some parts are really gross. But hey, that's what you get when you watch these kind of movies.A good teen movie.59%",4,1,2,13 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas adds another classic to star wars.
","George Lucas adds another classic to the star wars franchise with Episode 2 'Attack of the clones'. Well, I went to the cinema expecting a great film, and got an excellent one. At first, I thought the love story in it would be a bit sappy, but I loved that bit too. Very well done acting and the special effects were the best I've ever seen, as Yoda looks as real as real can be with character and emotion, which brings him full of life.Natalie Portman is perfect in her role while she fights for her life. And with plenty of famous faces pasted everywhere you look, you will no doubt enjoy it.Despite a love story in it, there is action a plenty, with the huge action scene at the end memorable. Also the team behind the camera has also done a marvelous job, doing a good job to make each of the characters look ten years older.With original characters from Episode 1, such as Watto, Jar Jar and the sith looking older, you get lost in the star wars world.Bravo to Lucas for a well directed, long movie (which I love). It's also great that Lucas has made each movie nice and long. Once again, well done to everyone who had something to do with one of the best movies of all time.My score: 10/10",7,0,1,16 May 2002
Predator," One of the best action/sci-fi movies ever.
","Kevin Peter Hall does a superb job as an alien-warrior from outer space that tries to hunt Arnie and his buddy's in the jungle. This is a movie i'll never turn down to watch, as i'm simply addicted to it. Heaps of action mixed with sci-fi is a great recipie for success. I've seen it about 3 times now and am always on the edge of my seat.What else can I say? Predator has become one of my favorite sci-fi movies rapidly. Go see it it's a must!9/10It beats the 'Aliens' movies anyday.",9,0,0,13 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of my favorite movies yet
","After it was out for about 2 weeks, I finally decided to go and watch this film, as many people were saying how it wa the greatest film ever. I thought I wouldn't be interested in this type of movie, but boy was I wrong. The special affects took my breath away, the acting was sensational, the plot excellent...well not even words can really describe this film. The lord of the rings made me feel I was there with the characters. Very imaginative and unique as well. You must see this movie before dying! 10/10 Only downside is poor character development.",10,1,1,16 March 2002
The Village," Dissapointing.
","Shyamalan still is the master of twists and deception but it was too much this time. Great cast depth, Ivy is hot and the realness is all there but the fact that this type of thing has already been done it was dissapointing. Up until the end it was nearing perfection. This is starting to become a worrisome habit with many movies these days and lets hope these bizarre endings end.85% of the movie is pure pleasure but unfortunatley the other 15% is rubbish and ruins it so overall about a 6 or 7. Dissapointing for M.Night's standard.",Null,0,0,2 September 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A good movie to watch when you have nothing to do at night!
","Terminator 2 is better than the 1st and delivers plenty of action and thrills. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect in the role he does. This movie is not bad for 1991, and the whole movie is interesting throughout as I never got bored of it. I'd give it 85%All in all a sensational movie",9,1,1,16 March 2002
Spider-Man," Watchable, but....
",".....The scenes aren't deep enough. The entertainment was 9/10, but what stops Spiderman from getting 10/10 for entertainment is a little lack of action scenes, especially of the Green Goblin. I'll most likely go see the sequel in a couple of years, let's hope it has more action.Otherwise, pretty good film! 75%",7,0,0,17 November 2002
Aliens," Great stuff
","Sigourney Weaver does a great performance in a thrilling sequel, where the aliens are back. Fantastic effects for 1986 and scary monsters, packed with suspense. Not as gorey as 'Alien', but still has it's moments.
A solid 8/10.",8,0,0,10 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Simply stunning.
","The large battle scene(you know what i'm talking about) is easily the best action scene ever, or at least that i've seen. No sequel let down this time, as the three were shot together so the form of director Jackson never strayed. Combining unbelieveably real special effects with solid acting, epic battles and the lovely scenery that is middle earth (nah, really new zealand)the two towers along with it's sibling films is arguably one of the great films in history.Everything about the movie is fantastic, it simply blows you away. A must 10/10",10,0,0,24 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The first was better.
","Perhaps TTT is so good I didn't realise it, or maybe I need to see it again, but by first impression I think it is good, but overated. I don't know I just couldn't tell. FOTR is better, but the long battle scene in TTT rules, I know that for sure. I must say i guess i was expecting a little too much after the hype of last year and this year.",10,0,0,2 January 2003
Meet Joe Black," Surprisingly FANTASTIC!
","I didn't think I'd like this movie, but once i watched it I was hooked! Brad Pitt really made it feel like he was death - not acting as death. And this film also for the time being made me not afraid of dying. I love the acting, the storyline, everything!My rating 10/10 just excellent!",7,1,1,19 June 2002
Men in Black II," An insult to sci-fi's.
","What the hell? Excuse me? Is this supposed to be Men In black? After such a great first film, this one collapses in every area the first movie achieved. I can't believe Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith were in such a crappy film! The special effects are second rate, as well as just about everything else.Keep away.",5,0,1,2 January 2003
Men in Black," A delicious sci-fi
","Colourful, creative characters fill this movie with charisma and style. A bug-like alien comes to earth and the men in black (Will smith and Tommy Lee Jones) must save the day from the scum. I must say I was very impressed with the special effects. It, like Goldeneye though is the kind of movie I wouldn't see to often as I would get bored. But thus it deserves a high score and I can't wait for the sequel.92%",8,0,0,16 March 2002
The Mummy Returns," Slow to it's feet
",After a very slow start and only a bit of action this movie recovered well with heaps of action and humour! It made me laugh at the scene with the mummy's on the bus and the special effects were great! A great plot and actors as well makes this a worthy film to watch after a slow start.78%,6,0,0,17 March 2002
Total Recall," Yet another boom-crash fantastic movie from Arnie.
","Well, what can i say? Total Recall can be a confusing movie but you get the hang of it pretty quick. I don't like it when their heads turn into tomatoes while they are out on the red planet. But other than that, i love it. The special effects are impressive for the year 1990 and there are heaps of cool characters. The movie makes you think if it's real or not which is interesting and intriging.Total Recall is great to watch any time of the day or night. Of course young kids below 10 would be scared, but if any older it should be fine. A great movie with heaps of action and fun!9/10",7,0,0,4 August 2002
Titanic," A Titanic movie of epic preportion.
","Based on a true story the film re-lives the horrors of when the real Titanic sank. As well as that, a poor boy( Leonardo DiCaprio)strikes up a romance with a rich daughter(Kate Winslet). It was one of the movie that seemed so real-in breath taking detail. As I said earlier, I thought I wouldn't like this film, but once i watched it last night, I can't blame other people for complaining about it only getting a 7 out of 10 (on average). Billy Zane plays a great role as the controlling boyfriend. There is something special about this movie. VERY special. Sometimes the special effects are a bit cheesy, but its convincingly covered up by the extremely tense scenes. This film made me feel extremely depressed but at the same time I couldn't look away.The acting is marvelous as well as the make up, trying to look like the clothes of old.James Cameron- I raise my glass to you as although this story is based on a true story-it will be remembered for a very long time.A classic.10/10.",7,2,4,30 June 2002
The Green Mile," A boring sunday night turns into a great movie to watch.
","It was sunday night and nothing good was on. Then I watched this, and it was one of the most emotion charged movies ever! I felt genuinley sad for the characters. The Cast was great, simply great. The ending was the weak point though, I thought. Otherwise very well done.9/10",9,1,2,24 November 2002
The Lion King," One of the best animated movies
","The lion king is one of the best if not the best animated movie of all time. Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg are great for the roles they do and this movie should be seen if you haven't yet. Also, great animations are another plus for the movie.85% Very good for an animation film.",8,2,3,21 March 2002
Signs," Potentially my favorite thriller.
","This would have to be one of my favorites - if not favorite thriller movie i've seen. It's the second best movie of the year for me, behind AOTC. *SPOILERS* Father Graham Hess(Mel Gibson) and his family start to discover that they are not alone when mysterious things start to happen, like large crop circles happening in their corn fields, and dogs acting weird and aggressive. Then they start to see the extra terrestrials.
I admit this movie was very tense and scary at some times, because you expect something to happen every time they zoom in on the door or window, etc. I felt a fear like the kind of fear I feel in real life, which I haven't felt with other movies. Also the film has plenty of unexpected surprises around every corner, which adds to the thrill and fear of it.Before I saw this, i thought Mel Gibson wouldn't fit the role, but he did a great job, as he helped bring out the suspense in Signs. Rory Culkin was also great in this film. The special effects were very good, but could have been better, as it looked like the aliens fitting in with the surroundings about 75-80%. Although not much action, it makes up for that with everything i just mentioned.Overall not the best movie in general, but the best thriller I have seen.76%",7,0,2,30 August 2002
Speed," Speed
","An ok action except that the acting completley sucks. Except for Keanu Reeves they can't act their way out of a paper bag. This is what really stops the movie from becoming a really enjoyable film for me. Otherwise, action and the plot is pretty good!60%",6,0,0,9 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Solid, solid movie.
","What a way to end the trilogy. Perhaps if you had to you could find mini chinks in the armour for the third movie, but they are covered up by delicious suspense and excellent screenplay.The large battle scenes near the end are just about as good as the two towers main one is, But maybe Legolas getting on and taking down the giant mammoth-like creature like he did is just a tad far-fetched?But who cares I suppose when you have a movie like this? There's always going to be some little thing about a movie that may seem a tad on the negative side. I wouldn't even call it on the negative side anyway. An unforgettable trilogy. 9/10",9,1,2,24 February 2004
The Truman Show," What can I say? Great!
","I loved the movie from start to finish. Great acting, especially Jim Carey, good story line with a good twist. Once you understand it its extremley enjoyable to watch.9/10.",9,0,1,19 June 2002
The Matrix," Very sweet!
","The matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever. It's remarkarbly unique and different and is a weird but wonderful movie. With a bunch of zany, wacky weird creatures (such as those octopus machine things) and interesting characters such as agent smith (Hugo Weavings) give this movie so much difference to your average one. Probably takes the award for the most uniquness. The way the film looks is unbelievable as well. Dont forget to watch this!81%",8,0,0,17 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the classics
","This started it all. Star wars. One of my favorites and easily one of the best of all time and no one would forget it. The special effects are actually quite amazing for a 1977 movie. Mark Hamill plays a great roll as Luke Skywalker and David Prouse gives that creepy feeling with his voice as Darth Vader. Also, there is unique creatures, droids and enemies in this sci-fi. The concept of the film is fantastic and everyone will love Star wars even if you aren't really interested in the genre. It's been 25 years and it's still going strong. A must.94%",10,0,0,16 March 2002
Contact," A lot to endure to just see 1 minute of the 'alien' at the end.
","I dunno, I just didn't see anything special here. I thought it was too long, and too much to endure just to see anything interesting for like one minute. When I saw the previews i had high expectations, but i was bitterly dissapointed. Liked the special effects though (for 1997).5.7/10",5,1,4,3 December 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Outstanding
","Indiana Jones and the last crusade is the best so far. Jam packed of action, action and more action. A strong plot and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford's acting is great in this movie as is Sean Connery. A must if you love action and adventure and it will be a classic for years to come!99%",9,0,0,21 March 2002
Jurassic Park," The best
","Jurassic Park shows dinosaurs being brought back through cloning and DNA, but when an accident occurs and the dinosaurs get out of their inclosures, all hell breaks loose. This is my favorite movie easily and I never get bored of it whenever I watch it. Steven Spielberg is the best in the business as he shows his class again with the best movie of all time. Underated, Jurassic Park includes outstanding effects such as great looking dinosaurs and action around every corner.Also included are talented actors such as Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Wayne Knight, Samuel L.Jackson and the list just goes on and on. And with actors such as those, the movie is always going to be an essential classic.100%!",10,3,5,17 March 2002
