Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best adventure of all time
","Okay, there is 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. There is 'Gunga Din' But nothing compares to this adventure, not even the sequels. Raiders has it all. It was Spielberg at his peak. This movie and ET are the best the man ever did, no matter how many Schindler's List's- or Color Purple admirers there are. Raiders is the wonder of cinema. Filmed in beautiful Scope, with a great score, fantastic action, wonderful effects and an exiting story-line, this film does still look like it was made yesterday. It was very successful and brought the adventure genre back in the race. After it many have tried to make an equally appealing adventure film. Some were nice (like 'Romancing the Stone' and 'The Goonies'), but others were terrible (like the Allan Quatermain films). It was only for a little while. I hope the genre will come come back some day.",10,0,0,16 July 1999
