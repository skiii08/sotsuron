The King's Speech," Ranks among the best films of the year
","While some may say 2010 has been a year where many films have disappointed, I have no doubt in saying The King's Speech is a film that delivers what it promises. Expertly directed with a perfect cast, there is no reason not to see this film.This is somewhat uplifting (it is after-all about a speech preparing a nation for war) film that has been carefully made to ensure the audience never lose interest in the events on-screen because there have been many films that deal with overcoming problems to the point where most are clich√©d and generic. The King's Speech keeps things feeling fresh and exciting from the use of humour and dramatic moments. Colin Firth gives another fantastic performance after A Single Man but I found this one to be more interesting. A Single Man was a good film and Firth gave a solid performance but this is the one he will be remembered for. The supporting cast are also fantastic, which includes Helena Bonham-Carter, Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon and the brilliant Geoffrey Rush. Every aspect of the film is perfect, making The King's Speech not only one of the best British films but one of the best films of the year. Do not miss this!",9,0,1,21 January 2011
The Avengers," Joss Whedon sets the bar high for future Marvel films.
","Putting Thor, Hulk, Captain America and Iron Man all into one film was never going to be easy, what with die-hard fans of certain characters demanding they each have their moment to shine. However, Joss Whedon succeeds in creating such a balanced film with a huge cast, he makes it look effortless. Avengers Assember/ The Avengers (take your pick) is one of the best films of the year and it hard to think of any other director who could have pulled it off. Sure there are many other great directors out there, but Whedon ensures that you don't to have of read the comics to appreciate this. The cast, direction, the script, the editing (very smooth), cgi, cinematography etc is amazing but I'm sure this has already been a lot mentioned about it. What made the film for me personally is the sense of camaraderie between all the characters as they work together, that is essential in any war/ team film that depicts people working together. Each character is also nicely developed, particularly Bruce Banner aka Hulk. Supporting members including Nick Fury, Hawkeye and Black Widow are also given their time to shine, and each actor is well cast. While Loki's motif could have seen a little more development, the film feels nicely rounded and the action is amazing to watch as New York is torn apart. The film is funny in places but never feels goofy or unnecessary (pay attention Michael Bay). Whedon's ability to keep the action fresh ensures that this film never falters and becomes tired. Avengers Assemble is an amazing film that gives the audience what they want and more, and is a sure contender for the best superhero film to date. While The Dark Knight Rises comes closer to its release, it is important to note that these are two very different films. Regardless, there is something for everyone and I strongly recommend watching it on the big screen.",8,1,4,29 April 2012
Changeling," Fantastic
","Changeling is based on a true story about a mother whose son disappears and while that sound like a simple/ familiar story, the film is excellent. I was expecting a good film having seen Letters from Iwo Jima but this film shows all of Eastwood's talents. The acting, cinematography, production design and directing are all superb. Angelina Jolie gives a great performance and deserved the Oscar nomination. The supporting cast are also very good ensuring that the film never drops in quality when Jolie is not on screen. While the story maybe too dark and disturbing for some (there is a scene that will make you question if yo want to watch the film again), for those who choose to watch the film will find it to be a gripping experience that leaves you hanging on every word and will leave the viewer satisfied.",10,2,5,20 August 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," One more step down from the original
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides had a few new things going for it and quite a few going against it, namely the budget being reduced, which is blatant throughout the film. While it tries to deliver on what the series is known for, it ends up feeling redundant.What the film did have going for it was the new cast of actors and a new storyline, that is not a direct continuation from the last one making it accessible for new audiences. However like last time the plot is over complex, has too many characters and fails to bring a satisfying conclusion to any of them. The Spanish Armada are made out to be a significant force and their is a race to the fountain of youth but that never comes across. Maybe it was the reduced budget; one scene involves everyone preparing for a ship battle but no. Ian Mcshane is a great actor and gives an intimidating performance as Blackbeard, however the script is weak and fail to make any of use of him. Unlike Davy Jones, one of the better villains in recent memory, Blackbeard simply barks orders and threatens people. There is no menace under his skin, which is a shame because he is meant to be a ruthless pirate. Penelope Cruz, while a good casting decision is poorly used and the relationship between her and Depp is underdeveloped. Stephen Graham always brings something to his roles and does so here but is not given enough screen time. Richard Griffiths is embarrassing to watch as King George and Keith Richards appears briefly but only to help push the film forward slightly. I was hoping to see more of his character this time but instead we get less. Replacing Elizabeth and Will are a missionary and a mermaid. Their involvement is small yet inoffensive and do not hurt the film as badly as what other people have made out. This leads me onto the mermaids, who steal the film/ have the best scene where they attack Blackbeard and his men. All the other action oriented scenes lacked any spectacle unlike the kraken scene from the second but this was very entertaining. The mermaids are presented as viscous yet seductive creatures who take men to the sea bed and kill them. It is also the only scene where there is a clear sense of danger and excitement. The films finalie is underwhelming and any drama and tension are broken by scenes of humour. While Depp, Rush and McNally as Gibbs are good, they too suffer from what felt as if a large proportion of the film was cut down to a restrictive budget. Unlike the first two films, I feel less-likely to be returning to watch this again.",6,1,2,4 November 2011
Underworld," Blood, bullets & Beckinsale
","This is another one of those types of films that should not be taken too seriously. If you watch the film from a critical standpoint then you will miss how enjoyable the film can be. Those who have no interest in vampires etc will not like this film but for those who do, this film is well worth watching. While the script may not be perfect, the actors manage to keep a straight face and are entertaining to watch. What many will like is the back story of Kate Beckinsale's character and the history between the vampires and the lycans. This may not add a lot of depth to the characters but it succeeds in progressing the story.Both Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are great as the leaders of two opposing forces. The two steel the film whenever they are on screen.Since the film is about vampires vs lycans, you can expect a lot of bloody action. The actions scenes can be compared to The Matrix and Equilibrium but they are still fun to watch. Even though some scenes do look dated (the lycans often look like puppets at times) they are still enjoyable to watch.The sequel may have improved CGI effects but that is not enough for it to triumph over the original.",7,5,7,1 September 2010
Iron Man 2," Brings back the fun but lacks the substance of the original
","The first Iron Man was a great film. The action was exciting, the interaction between the characters was great and Robert Downey Jnr was fantastic as Iron Man. The same can be said here but the film has something that stops it from being as good as the original. Its like they made the perfect sequel but it wasn't long enough so they filled it up with lots of unnecessary scenes that slow the film down and edited out Mickey Rouke's scenes.That said there is a lot to like here. Fans of the original will enjoy this but from what I've heard the producers rushed the director to make this in two years instead of three, which is a shame. Mickey Rouke does a great performance as Whiplash and when he has a chance to show it, he is ruthless. He kills people but we only get to see the blood on his hands from after the fight leaving it for us to imagine the actual fight itself. He is the best thing about this film and its a shame that he has such a limited screen time as he is involved in the best action scene of the film set in Monaco.Other supporting cast members include Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer who is good in places but I felt that they could have given him more to do because it is clear that he is immersed in his role completely. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Rhodes and does a good job as well. Scarlett Johansson has some great fight scenes but again they could have used her more as well. Gwyneth Paltrow gives another good performance but sadly she was in many of the scenes that could have been edited down.Another problem for some people is the advertising of the up-coming Avengers film. This is more time that could have been spent developing the villains of the film. There are also a lot of reference to it such as Captain America's shield. There is also a fight scene in Tony's house that was silly and you were not sure who you were supposed to be supporting and also do we really need to see Tony drunk, shooting empty bottles of champagne at a party? Tony is meant to be different to other superheroes but there are scenes like this make him less likable. However as mentioned earlier there is a lot to like and it comes towards the end of the film. The final action sequence is enjoyable (even though hundreds of people would have died) and had everything you would expect to see in an Iron Man film. There is also a lot of funny dialogue between characters, which keeps this enjoyable. I only hope that the next one fixes the problems from this and features what everyone loved from the first.",7,1,2,25 May 2010
The Hunger Games," Not having read the book I enjoyed it but far from great
","Over a week after seeing the film, giving me time to decide whether as good as the hype made it out to be, I am now ready to give my opinion. First-off The Hunger Games is a good film, whereby the cast are great, there is a sense of atmosphere and delivers what it promises. However, is it as good as how everyone hoped it to be? Well what is but this film has many flaws. While I can't blame a teen-oriented film for not showing the killing of multiple young people clearly, blood and everything, the director thought it would be better to zoom in hand-held camera with quick cuts so you never get a clear view to avoid offending its audience and receiving the 15/R rating. The overall effect is distracting and cheapens the film. If you intend to show something, then show it! The film's half-hearted attitude to the violence felt indecisive, not sure whether to stay true to the books or to make something family friendly. This is a much talked about issue and there is more that could be said, however the film does have its moments. Half the running time is set before the game begins and creates a tense atmosphere as the games move closer and closer. As mentioned the cast are great and the film allows time to develop their characters. Some scenes, particularly flashbacks, did feel poorly handled though and if more time had been spent developing them, I believe it would have improved the film immensely.As it stands, the film is good, however the direction is not all that strong. The climactic fight felt poorly handled, which is a shame since it also successfully developed the antagonist. Two CGI scenes were weak and did not add anything to film. While I did enjoy it, the film lacked a certain edge needed to keep me invested in what will happen next for the characters. Looking at the box office, hopefully the sequel will build on what this achieved and make up for its shortcomings.",7,1,8,2 April 2012
127 Hours," Danny Boyle does it again
","Here is a film where had it of been directed by someone else, the overall result would differ completely. Of-course each director is different but Danny Boyle has his own style that separates his films from others even if the story is may not be truly original. It's his style that makes 127 Hours a great film because there are so many ways that you can tell the story but he brings a sense of energy to the film that would not have been present if another director had made this. Similar to Cast Away, the film really does focus on the lead character, played by James Franco who is brilliant and deserved his Oscar nomination. He encapsulates the adrenaline fueled explorer perfectly where no mountain is too high for him and more importantly you like him. Its easy to sympathise with someone in the position that he finds himself in but his personality adds something to the film.What also makes the film stand-out is the cinematography and editing that can really pump up the tension. The film starts off colourful where everything is bright and full of life but by the end, the image has become dry as the hours build up.127 Hours is a film worthy of your attention. While the story may sound grim, and it does get pretty intense, the film should not be passed on.",8,1,3,1 March 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," While it does not live up to Singer's X-Men film, it is much better than the last X-Men film
","As with Terminator Salvation, I heard and read a lot of negative things about X-Men Origins: Wolverine but having watched the film it surprised me in how entertaining it was. The action was always enjoyable to watch and the characters always kept me interested. Sure this is not as good as X2 but this succeeds in keeping the audience entertained. As the film began I had a bad feeling that this would be terrible as the script was awful where we are introduced to Wolverine and Sabertooth when they were younger. The scene was really bad but thankfully the credits sequence begins where we see the two brothers fighting in various wars before they then meet General Stryker. Hugh Jackman always puts himself into his roles and he does it again here. While the script could have provided him with more to do, what he does do, he does well. The supporting cast are also good to watch including Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston. However it is Ryan Reynolds who steels the film as Deadpool despite having a very limited screen time. What makes this film better than X-Men 3 was that this never becomes dull; there is always something happening such as an action sequence or a new character being introduced. The script may not be perfect and what the film does with some of the characters will anger fans but this does improve over the last X-Men film. I can only hope that X-Men: First Class has a better script. However the action is fun and frantic, Wolverine is likable and the villains are entertaining to watch. Do not expect the next Batman Begins or Iron Man out this film because the origins of Wolverine are not very well told but that is not to say that it is not worth watching.",6,2,3,20 August 2010
Terminator Salvation," A throughly entertaining action film from start to finish!
","I watched this film with low expectations. Friends of mine have commented on how bad it was and the fact that it was directed by the person behind Charlie's Angels 2, I had little to look forward to. However I found the film to be non-stop action with a story that was not perfect but served its purpose. Christian Bale is excellent putting everything he had into the role of John Connor. Sam Worthington also gave a great performance. Its a shame though that the marketing spoils the major plot twist in the film so you already know too much if you have seen the trailers.The action kept my attention throughout the entire film and there are a lot of action scenes. The CGI and sound effects are really impressive. It shows you how far we have come since The Terminator in terms of effects. Although there is one fight in the rain that did feel clich√©d and the film could have done without it. Despite that one scene, the action was always entertaining and the final fight was great to watch without spoiling anything. Despite a lot of interesting scenes such as early on when Christian Bale jumps into the scene from an aircraft, the film does have its flaws. Most notably Common, who is one of the better rapper-turn-actors as he has some bad dialogue and is only there to increase the amount of recognisable actors involved. I also felt that they could have done more with Michael Ironside's character. Some of the lines from the previous Terminator films are also here (i'll be back) take you out the film.Die hard fans might not be pleased with everything that happens in the film but for everyone else this is a great action film. A vast improvement over Terminator 3 thanks to great acting, action and a good story.",8,1,3,22 May 2010
Zodiac," One of Fincher's best!
","Sometimes it's the best films that may slip past you upon their release and for me, Zodiac is a film that falls into that category. The content is dark and unpleasant and the surprising lack of any attention from the Academy or from any other major awards certainly didn't help this films popularity but I urge you know to seek this film out. Based on a true story of the San Francisco murders by the mysterious individual known only as the Zodiac and is directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network). The film follows Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a cartoonist for a newspaper but soon becomes obsessed with helping the police find the person responsible. Some of you will know that the case was never solved but how does this make for a satisfying film I hear you cry. Well that would spoil the film. Today we are so used to seeing crime films where you already have a good idea as to who the culprit is that it often results in becoming clich√©d. Here we know as much as the detectives do and by that I mean not a lot. This adds to the suspense when the detectives are speaking to various suspects who may or may not be the killer. The acting, directing, lighting, sound, camera angles and editing is all fantastic and this is all evident in one of the films more disturbing scenes where we witness two murders. Everything about the way it starts to how it ends is tense. We know that there is no one around as a man from behind a tree approaches a couple enjoying a quiet afternoon at the lake and because of this we feel their fear. Supporting cast members include Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. who are both brilliant. Each actor plays to their strengths well and are able deliver each line perfectly, which makes it such a shame that the film was not recognised by the Academy when The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was. Both are fantastic films yet it is this film that leaves a lasting impression. For those who like films that are suspenseful then you will find a lot to like here. The dark story will deter some from seeing this film but for anyone interested in the crime genre or are a fan of David Fincher's previous films, this is a film I strongly recommend.",10,1,1,23 October 2010
The Expendables," Sit back and enjoy!
","What separates The Expendables from other action films that revolve around a team working together (The Losers, Red, G.I Joe) and what also makes it better is the cast. While there are always other actors who could have been included, the film has a very strong cast who all play off one another well, that you can't help but enjoy the film because it knows that it is to entertain.Sometimes films aim for just that and fail because they don't have the right ingredients but it is clear that Sylvester Stallone knows how to craft an action film. While his direction is not perfect, the story is well told and paced appropriately; its simple but is fun to watch.The cast include Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Ludgren, Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts. All of whom are good in their roles and when the action kicks up, the film is blast. While there are certainly better action films to be found with better stories, developed characters and jaw-dropping action sequences, The Expendables is easy watch and will appeal to a wider audience.Its not perfect, you can tell just from watching the trailer, but it is far better than what some critics make it out to be. Get a group of friends together to watch this and you have your evening made. This is entertaining from start to finish. Its everything it should be.",7,3,7,22 January 2011
The Town," Great performances all-round and directing make this well worth watching
","Despite not having seen Gone Baby Gone, I've heard a lot of good things about Ben Affleck's switch to directing and so I decided to watch The Town, which put simply is about band robbers but to expand on that, the film is also about the leader of the group, played by Ben Affleck. When watching the trailer it easy to draw comparisons to Heat and The Departed but this is different. Many films about crime make the audience side either the police or the criminals yet The Town allows the audience to see people from both sides of the law fairly. Jon Hamm plays an honest working FBI officer while Ben Affleck plays the criminal. The film is shot predominately from the criminals perspective, therefore the audience feel the same sense of urgency that they do but we don't want to see them gun down the FBI and police and let them get away with their crimes. It is a difficult challenge for the director to deal with but he does it well and the end result is very good.The entire cast are all fantastic even when given smaller roles, for example Chris Cooper and the late Pete Postlethwaite steel the scenes that they are in. Jeremy Renner has earned a lot of attention from his role and he deserves it, giving an honest performance, which clearly took a lot of research to perfect. An almost unrecognisable Blake Lively and Rebecca Hall are both great. Ben Affleck and Jon Hamm as the opposing forces are also great but it is Renner's performance that stands out.As a crime film, it is important that the action doesn't turn the whole film into an all guns blazing film. The action scenes are handed pretty well and the car chases through the minor roads of Boston are really exciting to watch.The Town is not only only a solid action/ crime film but also marks Affleck as a great director. I strongly recommend this film if you are interested in the genre. While it is not perfect, it does so much well, that you would be missing out if you didn't see this.",8,65,78,20 January 2011
Shutter Island," Almost flawless. The work of a genius
","Films similar to Shutter Island rely upon the viewer's strict attention because it is important at the end and sometimes it is easy to guess the conclusion of the film before the end. What makes Shutter Island so good is that you know as much as the lead character does and it never feels like we, the viewer are going over old territory that has been used before in films. This is one of those film where I can name the people involved and you can instantly decide whether you will want to see this. Its directed by Martin Scorsese, the cinematographer is Richard Richardson, edited by Thelma Schoonmaker and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley. Everyone and everything in this film is fantastic. What some films similar to this try to create but fail to do is atmosphere. Shutter Island is dripping in atmosphere and can become quite disturbing in places, particularly during the flashbacks. To go into detail would spoil the film.Shutter Island is dark and will not appeal to all because of its content. If you are a fan of Scosese's work or of any of the actors then this is unmissable. The film is brilliant and I look forward to watching it again.",9,1,3,17 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," More art house than mainstream blockbuster. A brilliant film thats essential viewing for fans
","Coming from a person who has not read the books I really enjoyed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and cannot wait for part 2. The previous film while it had its flaws was able to continue progressing the film at a steady pace. I only wished that the last film had more of a climax and since this one has split up one book into two films, I was fearing that this would leave me disappointed but it didn't!This film is clearly no longer made for children and the story has reached that point where newcomers will be completely lost and will need to start at the beginning in order to catch up. I know this sounds similar to last three films but this one is different. I think it is safe to say that this requires the viewer to be able to remember what Harry, Ron and Hermione have been through otherwise you will find it difficult to connect with characters. The reason for this is that it is more of an art film than a traditional blockbuster action film, which is great because of how it is not afraid to step outside of the box. There are scenes which had me wondering how much further the filmmakers could go before the age rating would have to go up. The overall effect of this makes the film a refreshing experience and it is good to see that the film is aiming specifically at fans and no longer concentrates on trying to attract new audiences.Having said that, the film does include several breathtaking action sequences that will keep you in suspense, such as a furious chase through a forest and a fight scene in a house, which I will not spoil for you. However the action in this film is not as frequent as it once was in previous films of the series, therefore expect lots of scenes involving talking but this is not a bad thing, which leads me onto the characters.Since I have not read the book, scenes that were taken out providing extra background details did not bother me but for those who have, might feel bothered by this since it has been split into two films. With a running time of over 2 hours (it felt less) and less time spent on action, the film is able to concentrate on its characters. The acting is great and while some characters get more screen time than others, everyone performs to their strengths. What earned the last film an Oscar nomination was its cinematography and it continues to amaze here. Setting the atmosphere perfectly for each scene, it is clear that the Harry Potter series would not be the same without it. The direction is also brilliant, bringing something new to the Harry Potter series each time.Darker in atmosphere, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 should not be missed. The slight change in tone will not be for everyone but it does allow for the actors to shine and for the story to be given the credit it deserves. While it may not cover everything from the book, its long running time makes for a satisfying viewing experience leaving you eager for Part 2.",9,5,8,28 November 2010
Wanted," It had all the pieces but they wanted to try something different and the film suffers for that
","This is an example where if the makers tried to make the typical action film then this would have been quite good fun. A young guy finds out he is part of a league of assassins and tries to hunt down the man responsible for his fathers death. Had they made an action film about that then it would have been good but the director wanted to be different and the result is a poorly made film with unlikable characters.I know that this is based off a graphic novel but there was a lot of potential here, for example the ability to curve bullets. The problem lies in that most of the action scenes involve the heroes fighting one enemy and that isn't interesting. This limits the action considerably and the final action scene is just bad. There is no tension since you don't care about anyone. If like your action films filled with unlikeable characters, lots of swearing, breaking the forth wall (that really annoyed me) and CGI, then you will like this film.The visuals are really good though. There is a action scene with a train, which was the best thing about the film. Everything else just fell short. James McAvoy's character Wesley is really unlikeable from the start. You never like him once throughout the film and that will stop a lot of people from enjoying Wanted.Rent this film if you are interested in seeing it or if you have read the graphic novel, otherwise unless you are interested if hearing the cool sound effects, you may want to miss this.",3,2,7,9 May 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Don't let 'that' scene put you off, this is well worth checking out
","Speaking as someone who has not seen the Swedish adaptation of the famous series or read the books for that matter, I had little to go by on what to expect other than what i had seen in the trailers and heard about from friends, so I was going into the film fresh and I can say that I highly recommend it. As with The Social Network, Fincher strikes the perfect balance between involving the audience with all the information on screen while not overloading them at the same time. It is tricky to do, but with his talent in directing, the film's two hour plus running-time goes by in a flash. The film is in many ways a master-class in all that it does; from perfectly honed performances to the fantastic editing (edited by the Oscar winning team who did The Social Network and won again for this). Prior to this Rooney Mara had a only a few noticeable roles to mention, but does a fantastic job settling in as the film's protagonist, Lisbeth. Daniel Craig gives a subtle understated performance as her partner who work together to solve a 40-year old plus murder. Supporting actors including Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsg√•rd are also brilliant. The only weakness that I can think to mention is that we are sometimes unsure of who the main suspects are as the film moves at such a pace, however this is not Scooby Doo and the film features several scenes to remind you of that. Whether or not Fincher chooses to continue with the series, he has made yet another fantastic film that is well worth checking out but not when eating.",9,2,7,26 September 2012
2012," One of the best disaster films in a long time
","2012 has received a many mixed reviews since it was released but this is by no means a terrible film. It however does feature things that will annoy people such as a character risking their families lives to run back to a burning vehicle and clich√©s that we have seen many times before but if you watch this knowing what to expect, you will enjoy it.In some ways this is the disaster film to end all disaster films. There is so much destruction that the special effects crew have had to work incredibly hard to show cities being torn apart by earthquakes. Those who do not like special effects in films and prefer practical effects will not like the film. 2012 overloads on the amount of special effects completely but without it, the makers would be restricted to what they could pull-off.As mentioned earlier the story is clich√©d and generic. You know how it will end but that does not take away from the enjoyment of the film. I do however wish that they added something supernatural about the film. At the start it mentions that there has been a mass suicide where many hundreds of Mayans have killed themselves. After that there is no other mention of it again and 2012 becomes just another disaster film. They could have made hints that aliens were involved etc but we are forced to forget that. Had they of tried something different, this could have made the film more exciting and interesting.While the film is not perfect, it is enjoyable and Chiwetel Ejiofor does another good performance adding to the human element of the film in how we must stay together during tough times. In some ways this is a missed opportunity but if you are in search of a fun, Hollywood disaster film, this is the film for you.",7,2,4,11 June 2010
I Am Legend," An exciting first two thirds let down by a poor ending
","This is another one of those films that takes an interesting concept but has no idea how to conclude it. For the first two thirds of the film, I was on the edge of my seat as Will Smith entered dark, derelict buildings. It is a shame though that the final third changes the films atmosphere and takes away any suspense that was in the first two thirds of the film.Thankfully Will Smith is consistent as ever doing a fantastic performance as Robert Neville, a scientist who is working on a cure to heal infected humans. His performance carries the film and it would not have been half as good, were he not involved.People have complained about the CGI in the film and it is indeed bad in places. However this did not bother me as I was able to ignore it. The real issues though is the ending. Without spoiling too much, the ending reveals a lot to the audience that makes the film feel like a waste. It is anti-climatic and this is were the alternative ending succeeded. The film is exciting for the most part and Will Smith gives another powerhouse performance but the ending is a disappointment. Overall I do recommend the film.",7,0,0,21 June 2010
Kick-Ass," Kicks ass!
","When I first saw the trailer, I dismissed it thinking that it would be another gross out teen comedy but when some of friends asked if I wanted to see it, I decided to join them whilst going in with an open mind and the result is amazing! The film maintains being funny from start to finish whilst being able to have a very dark and sad scene at the same time.I watched this film over a week ago and thought carefully before giving it a 10 but the film deserves it. This is because it blends cool action scenes (Nicolas Cage has a great fight scene), witty dialogue and likable characters together. The story runs smoothly and I never found the story boring. Where the Spiderman films failed, this makes up for it. I have to say though that I enjoyed this film a lot more than the Spiderman, X-Men and Hulk films because Kick Ass' director, Matthew Vaughn, keeps you entertained by introducing something cool and interesting or something that you did not see coming. The acting is also great with Nicolas Cage giving a strong performance as Big Daddy, the super hero role that he was looking for and not Ghost Rider. Chloe Moretz as Hit-Girl is also very good saying things that are indeed questionable but they are far and few between. Aaron Johnson as Kick Ass gives a very good performance in a role that will surely make him a recognisable star in good time.I strongly recommend this film to anyone looking for something that will be entertaining but also has a great story. There are a lot of cool action sequences such as one where they make reference Call of Duty, which I know will be more than enough to attract young people in. The director has a great understanding of how to use music in his films, similar to what he did in Layer Cake and he does it again here, assisting in making this a fantastic film.",8,3,12,17 April 2010
Unknown," A film that gives more than what the trailer promised
","Without spoiling too much, I originally thought that any surprises to be found in Unknown were ruined having viewed the trailer and that I had figured the film out. Only to my surprise that I was wrong and that Unknown is a thrilling action film that never looses its pacing. The plot quickly develops over the 2 hour running time and will leave the viewer satisfied.It is easy to compare the film at first to Taken, another film staring Liam Neeson but once it starts, the film is very different. Whether Unknown is better or not is debatable but Liam Neeson succeeds in giving us another fine performance in a career of many. Other stars include January Jones from Mad Men who is good but felt underused. Diane Kruger is clearly immersed into her role as an illegal immigrant in Berlin caught up in the films story and Bruno Ganz is fantastic as a former secret police officer trying to make sense of what has happened to Liam Neeson's character, Martin Harris.What makes this film so good is that is wastes no time in setting the up the film and each scene gives something new to the film rather than taking away. There is never a dull moment because the story is always moving and we, the audience are put in the position of Liam Neeson, immersing the audience into the story. The film is not deep but it is neither dumb, the script is great and we feel for the character's frustration as he is not coming up with any useful answers. Despite what some may consider a relatively low budget when compared to other action films (The Bourne film, James Bond), Unknown manages to pull off some gripping action sequences and chases but it is through the director's ability to tell a story that makes scenes that just involve dialogue to be as exciting as the action sequences themselves.I strongly recommend anyone to see Unknown because you will enjoy it. With many films coming out receiving mixed reviews, this is a film to fall back on where the pacing is perfect and the tension is set to maximum. Hopefully Liam Neeson's next action film will be as good as this to wash away Wrath of the Titans after it has come out.",8,0,2,14 April 2011
Clash of the Titans," Another example of wasted potential
","I would like to start by getting one thing out of the way and that is the 3D is awful. Everything is too dark making day time scenes look like you are watching the film through the tinted glass of car. I am aware that 3D reduces the colour by 20% but it was never an issue with Avatar. I took my glasses off several times and everything looked clearer because this film was not made at all for the 3D transfer. Moving swiftly onto the film. Staring Sam Worthington the film begins with a weak introduction as we see Pete Postlethwaite trying to work with a poor script. His screen time is brief but good and the film moves quickly on not allowing for any character development. This isn't usually important in action films but in a film that is about a man who plans to kill the Gods, it would help if we felt at least something for them.This then lead me onto the script which is poor to say the least. The film just moves from place to place without any reason. For some reason after Worthington's boat is destroyed, he his captured by soldiers and taken to their Kings great hall so that he can conveniently be spotted by Hades who is sent to deliver a warning to the city. Everything just happens so that they can move the plot along and this becomes more annoying later on. The dialogue is also an issue. Ralph Fiennes and Mads Mikkelsen do the best out of the cast but they are never used to their full potential. Sam Worthington's character is hollow and is still in Jake Scully mode from Avatar. The shaved look didn't help either. Liam Neeson, who is a great actor, is given a lot of really bad lines, particularly at the end, which is a shame because I know he could do a lot better with a proper script. 3D was the Achilles' heel of the action scenes (see what I did there...) but taking the 3D aside they were not terrible, they were just underwhelming. The scorpion fight scene started with the characters running through a forest straight to a desert (for sheer plot convenience) and then there were scorpions. The fight was exciting at points but you could not tell who was alive and who was dead. The Medusa scene was better but for some reason they killed off every soldier (and that strange creature thing who was not explained very well) besides Perseus in this scene so that he would look heroic. Nicholas Hoult played the youngest character and usually the do not die in films so this felt strange when he turned to stone. Sadly this also suffers what the Scorpion scene had where you could only tell who was still alive by seeing who was no longer on screen. The final action scene that involves the kraken was the worst of the three because it was so short and it ended on such an anti-climax when everyone was expecting a battle of man verses monster but instead it quickly turns to stone and BANG the krakens dead. Disappointing. The CGI was good but a distinct lack of pacing stops this from being enjoyable. We see the statue of Zeus but then it collapses. We soon get to know the soldiers but then they all die and then the kraken appears but that soon dies. There is good material here but it was poorly handled and the film suffers as a result. If you have seen the trailer then you have seen everything that this film has to offer sadly.",4,3,5,13 April 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," More wasted potential when the concept was great but the treatment...
","Those who have seen the trailer will think that this is a cool, exciting action film about men who control the destinies of others and the man who says, 'I will not stand for this!' but sadly that is not the story of the film. The concept is great and there are moments where I thought the film was going to get better because the story sounds interesting. I'll start with the good. As I have mentioned before the film sounds interesting and as these mysterious men enter the film, you are interested to see what they can do. Anthony Mackie and John Slattery were well cast and Matt Damon's performance while not perfect (because of the script) is good and keeps the film together. Apart from the above I can't think of anything else because the script is dull and the characters feel one-dimensional. Emily Blunt has little to do in the film and Terrence Stamp is completely misused. We hear how his character is cold and will do anything to get the job done but the film never shows this. What could have saved the film would have been some kind of emotional pull if we felt that the two leads were meant to be together because that would have kept the film interesting. Instead there is little reason to care what happens by the end. Themes including free will and pre-destination are mentioned and are interesting when they are brought up but the script doesn't do anything with it. Without spoiling anything, Matt Damon does make a discovery halfway through the film and it could have been a major plot point but the way film deals with it feels unnatural and out-of-character.The film also lacks a sense of energy but maybe that is due to my initial expectations as the film is completely miss-marketed as an action thriller. However the film could have played up the villains in the film (if you can call them that) because you learn what they have done and what they are capable of doing. In the hands of another director, this would have been an enjoyable film to watch. The idea is there but something went wrong along the way and this is the result. This isn't essential viewing but if you are interested, rent it.",5,141,254,5 March 2011
Thor," This film, I like it. Another!
","With The Avengers in the horizon, there is reason to doubt whether this will be Iron Man or Iron Man 2 where its development was rushed so that Stark would be ready to team up with the likes of Hawkeye and Hulk. However through Kenneth Branagh's directing he is successful in making an enjoyable action film about the God of thunder.In an interview Kenneth Branagh said that Thor is similar to Shakespeare because of the family conflicts. The script itself may not be Shakespeare but you can draw some similarities. It is in these moments of conflict between father (Antony Hopkins) and son (Chris Hemsworth) where the film shines. While the filmmakers did their best to make the Earth scenes interesting, they do not hold up well to the scenes on Thor's home planet.Thor is a visually spectacular film with amazing CGI. Some say that it is becoming over used in films today but this film uses it with care. There are no moments where the CGI would drop below par. Like the film it remains consistent throughout.The acting that includes many recognisable faces, is very good. Chris Hemsworth as Thor handles the character well as does his brother in the film played by Tom Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba are also really good. Natalie Portman, while also good, is never given any dialogue to help project herself above romantic interest sadly.While you might not really care for the romantic sub-plot until the end, the film packs a punch, delivering solid action sequences. Unlike Iron Man 2, this left me interested in seeing what happens next in The Avengers.",8,17,34,2 May 2011
The Happening," Could have done with a bit more happening
","Upon its release, The Happening received many negative reviews and was nominated for four Razzie awards including worst film but having viewed the film for the first time, I discovered that while it was far from being a great film, it was certainly not as bad as people say. Made with the intention of being like a B-Movie, the story focuses on a married couple who discover that America has gone under some sort of attack where people are killing themselves. While not perfectly executed, the story does sink the viewer into what is happening and the plot does move at a swift pace for the majority of the film.What really hinders the film from being good is the dialogue given to actors who can do so much more. Like the remake of The Wickerman, The Happening has now become a comedy in many people's eyes and if you search on the Internet, you will find spoofs and reedits. Some of the scenes are so bad, that you wonder what was going through the director's head. I would usually say that they could have been taken out and left on the cutting room floor but with a running time of 1hour and 20 minutes, they needed all the footage they could find. On a technical level the film is good; the photography is good but there are some bad reaction shots which when up-close on an actors face, feel strange and out of place. The music by James Newton-Howard is very good and there are a few gruesome moments that will make the audience cringe. However there are not enough scenes that really emphasise how much danger they are in. We get the impression that the threat is deadly but as the audience, we need to see more as there are no scenes where we really doubt if the lead characters are in danger. This is after all a horror film.While there are a few laughable scenes due to the dialogue or the acting, The Happening is not a terrible film but it is certainly not perfect. As a viewer, I never became bored or lost interest in the story. A good idea that could have been so much more.",6,0,1,23 October 2010
Inception," Awesome! Nolan's best film to date
","The cinema that watched Incpetion had problems at the beginning (the screen went yellow) and we had to wait around 20 minutes before the films started but it it finally started there was a cheer and then everyone went silent. I have never been in a cinema where the audience were as compelled as they were here. This was the start of something fantastic, something that makes all of the films around it tremble, this is Inception.I could start by trying to tell the story but that would be considered stupid, this is a film that must be seen. The story is complex and spends the first quarter/ third introducing you to the film. It is like a security entrance where you are instead introduced to everything before you can enter otherwise you will have no idea what is happening. Christopher Nolan has been able to create his masterpiece and has outdone The Dark Knight. The film is flawless on every level; cinematography is again brilliant, sound great, CGI great and the acting is above and beyond what I was expecting. I expected good performances but every actor involved was perfectly cast and are all incredible. Leonardo DiCaprio does his best performance to date showing an array of emotions to a very complex character. Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Marion Cotillard are incredible. Many will know that this film is about dreams and this is explored really well. A simple idea creates so much depth. What they do with DiCaprio's character is amazing and will make you wonder what it is like inside your own dreams and what you would do to your memories. Despite a long running time I did feel that more could have been included. Having said that the pacing is great; we are introduced into this world carefully so that audiences can understand everything.The story is unique but that does not mean that no time was spent on the action sequences. One of the complaints people have had against Christopher Nolan is that his action scenes good be better but here they are gripping. They will keep you in suspense all of the way through and there is a real sense of danger for the characters involved.This film also has one of the best car chases that I have ever seen in a film because it is so different from any other car chase that I have seen before and would only fit in the context of this film. This also goes for the other action/ fight scenes that are just mind-blowing to watch; a part of you wonders how they were able to do it while the other is just amazed. You have to see it on the big screen to fully appreciate what they did. I remember Christopher Nolan saying that he felt relieved that nothing could ever top The Dark Knight but he may want to consider what he said. This is not another 'I liked this film so I will rate it 10' I reserve 10 for films that raise the bar, keep you gripped from start to end, films where you care for the characters, have scenes that will touch you and this film does all of those. This has been a mixed year in terms of the films released as some were good (Kick Ass), others were also good but had some flaws (Robin Hood, The Book of Eli and The Losers) and others were terrible (Clash of the Titans). Thankfully this can rate as quite possibly the best film of the year. Some will say that this nowhere near as good as The Godfather but that remains debatable. What this is, is one of the best films that has been released in over the last 20 - 30 years. Miss this at your peril. This is a complex and engaging masterpiece. Turn on your brain and enjoy!",10,3,7,17 July 2010
Moon," So very difficult to fault
","Every now and then a film comes along where everything that it does, it does superbly and Moon is one of those films. The story is interesting and never loses its footing. The acting/ actor is brilliant, Sam Rockwell continues to amaze and the direction is spot-on. While I do not give the film a 10, anyone should check this out sometime, it is not essential but it is worth watching.The story is difficult to describe without spoiling anything but if you have seen the trailer, then you will know what the film is about. Yet despite a simple premise, the film feels very emotional; you think about how you would cope under the conditions that the character is in and therefore you sympathise with him. Assisting in making this a fantastic film is the soundtrack. Composed by Clint Mansell who quickly becoming 'that guy who makes epic music' does a great job in making a peaceful soundtrack that reflects the films story. Other impressive features include the cinematography and the special effects. All scenes that take place outside on the surface of the moon have a unique style that while it does not look photo-realistic, is impressive and the crew should be recognised in being able to make a sci-fi film on a limited budget. Duncan Jones rightfully won his BAFTA but it is still a shame that the film did not receive more recognition. While the film could have been longer, what it has is more than enough in order to make this a film well worth watching.",9,3,11,1 October 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An improvement on the last film but then again the only way was up
","Having enjoyed the first film a lot (a good blend of action and comedy), I was greatly disappointed by the second film (too much bad comedy and barely any memorable action scenes) and was concerned how the third would turn out. It seems that Bay reduced some of painfully unfunny comical moments from the last and improves on the action however there are still some moments that take us back to ROTF reminding me that Bay still hasn't learned entirely from his previous mistakes.There's no writer's strike to hind behind this time and Spielberg is back on the team so what stops this from being as good as the first one? The best answer that I can give is that the film feels too chaotic and messy in its storytelling for it to become truly enjoyable. There are some key plot points that are delivered either by crazy robots who are hard to understand or by human characters talking really fast while the camera is focusing on their skin molecules. If you are going to tell a story in a film aimed towards a young audience, speak clearly or as in this case, it turns into someone making a mess of a job interview by speaking too fast in an effort to cover up any holes in their presentation hoping that those listening will not notice. I know that the story isn't really worth worrying about but we deserve to have an understanding of what is going on.Other issues include unnecessarily comedic moments such as Ken Jeong who should have been taken out of the script (but his scenes are pointless so maybe there was no script for him) as that could have allowed for more time to be spent trying to develop the Autobots. Thankfully that character has an abrupt ending that couldn't have come sooner. However the film does achieve at some points in being funny. Perhaps if the film had concentrated on being like the trailer i.e. being darker and focusing on the events at-hand it would have been so much better.Thankfully the film never becomes too offensive unlike the last, making for an enjoyable final act as Chicago is destroyed. Amongst all the chaotic destruction that we have all seen before is an action set-piece set within a collapsing building that we keep you fixed to the screen. It has everything that Bay forgot to do with the rest of the film, which is that there is tension, there is a purpose to the scene, the build-up is great and you are actually concerned for how the characters will escape. If only there were more scenes like this one, which you actually care for!Returning cast members (Shia, Sam's parents who are actually pretty good this time, Josh Duhamel and John Turturro) are all watchable. Meagan Fox's replacement may divide opinion but I found Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to fit in well amongst the rest of the film. John Malkovich is funny at first but his character soon feels more like a cameo. Ken Jeong was horrible to watch and nearly derailed the film. Patrick Dempsey was good at would he did but come the battle he had little to do. Frances McDormand played the cold government agent role well while Alan Tudyk was good but deserved a bigger role. But of-course the film is about the Transformers and the auto-bots in this are all pretty good. Like last time there could have been more of Ratchet and Ironhide but they have their moments. Bumblebee is as good as he was in the first film but I felt the focus had been moved too far away from him and Sam's relationship together which was important in the first film. Optimus still demands the audiences attention every-time you that red and blue truck enter the screen but there is one scene where I found myself questioning his actions but on the whole he was great and Peter Cullen is fantastic as ever.There is something wrong with the villains though this time as they never really seem to be much of a threat as they seem to get taken down pretty quickly. More of an emphasis on the villains strengths and capabilities would have drastically improved the already enjoyable action scene at the end. Sorry guys but the once great Starscream from the first film is gone and we are still left with a sniveling henchman that is embarrassing to watch at times considering he was the one who tore those jets to pieces at the end of the first. Overall this is enjoyable to watch. When it works (collapsing building and car chase scenes) it really works and this also goes for the humour. Sadly the film is not perfect but I doubt anyone was expecting it to be. Once again the trailer promises something else but what we end up receiving is still worth your attention if you enjoyed the either of the last two.",4,0,2,7 July 2011
The Social Network," A great film that leaves you wanting more
","When The Social Network was first announced as 'a film about Facebook' , I was skeptical about whether the film would be worth seeing or not. However once I saw the trailer, I could not wait to see the film and I am glad to say that it does not disappoint.David Fincher is one of those directors whose style is in everything that he makes and while at first that may not seem appropriate for a film about Harvard students creating a social website, it somehow makes the film better. Were this in the hands of another director, I don't think the film would have been as well received. The choice in music, camera angles, editing, lighting and the cast is all brilliant.What will immediately hook the audience in is the which, which is so sharp and witty. From the first five minutes, we quickly get to know who Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Isenberg) really is and what he is like around other people. While at first it may seem strange that someone like him would be best friends around the likable Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who is caring and forgives Mark for some of his actions, their friendship it believable. This makes it a shame that we know that their friendship will never last.The acting in this film is great and all of the cast fit their roles perfectly. Jesse Insenberg is fantastic to watch as is Andrew Garfield (who is an actor clearly worth watching), Rooney Mara despite a small role is good, Armie Hammer who plays both twins is excellent and Justin Timberlake shines in another role as the founder of Napster. Despite how engaging the film is, I found myself wanting to see more as if the film had been edited down for commercial reasons. The film lasts 2 hours and within that running time it tells the story effortlessly thanks to David Fincher's direction but I wish more time was spent on the relationship between Mark and Eduardo as the film is constantly progressing forward.The film is well worth watching and I will certainly be interested in watching it again. Fincher continues to impress and I look forward to seeing what comes next for him and the actors in this film.",9,1,2,30 October 2010
