Requiem for a Dream," This Blew Me Away
","Let me start off by saying I am 15 years old, and I am the type of person the MPAA decited shouldn't see this movie (someone who is under 17) I am also an indie film buff so therefore couldn't pass up an oppertunity to see this film. I thought that Aronofsky's 'Pi' was one of the strangest and yet brilliant movies ever. I thought to myself how could he possibly follow that up? Then I saw Requiem... Requiem for a Dream goes places that other anti-drug films would dare go. We see the charecters go from semi-normal, sure they're junkies but they aren't at their low (yet)Over the course of 100 minutes we see them develope from this state to totaly desperate people that you feel nothing but sympathy for. I shun the MPAA for not letting the group of people who need to see this film the most (teenagers) see it. This film is also a prime example of great acting. Jared Leto fresh out of Fight Club gives a incredible performance as Harry Goldfarm, a herion shooting, coccaine snorting addict. His best friend is played by Malon Waynes, who despite his previous films shines. Harry's girlfried is played by Jennifer Conneley who has come quite a long way since her days of Labryinth. Then we come to Ellen Burstyn who is simpley stunning as Harry's mother Sara, who is addicted to diet pills and television. Let me say right now that this film is not for everyone, there are some moments in this film that are tough to swallow, and rightly so! But to anyone who is up to it I challenge you to watch Requiem for a Dream. And parents, if your kids are mature enough to handle a film like this (and beleive me they have to be mature)let them watch it with you.",Null,0,0,3 June 2001
Memento," A Mental Mind Game That Won't Let You Go...
","Memory loss, stick-it notes, tattoos, and polariod photos. These are the things that Leonard Shelby has at his disposal to find the man who raped and murdered his wife. Structured in a reverse order of events, Chistopher Nolan's sophmore effort Memento is the kind of film that will be talked about, studied, and depated for years to come. Memento is the kind of film that at times makes you confused as hell, and then makes you sit back in surprise. Memento is also the kind of film that once you think you have it figured out tears your predictions to shreads. On top of the top notch acting (Pearce, Moss, and Pantoliano all at their best), Memento is driven by your own psychological interest in the plot. I can assure you that you won't get Memento on your first viewing. But it is well worth going to see multiple times. **** for Memento.",10,0,1,24 July 2001
The Others," Better the The Sixth Sense...
","If (when) The Others becomes a fairly popular film, then many comparisons will be made to The Sixth Sense. The only real reason that it would even be compared to The Sixth Sense is the shear fact that The Sixth Sense was the last decent psycologial horror film to come out. The Others is a completley different film, except for the fact that the children can see ghosts (or can they...) The Others, who's only star is Nicole Kidman, is a tense, creepy, and sometimes just damn horrifying, expericence. I wont give away any of the plot, it's too complicated, but I will say that where The Sixth Sense relied on one big twist to pull everything together, The Others has several. The Others is a film that was thought out, well written, and then executed with perfection. In reading other user comments, I have noticed that some didn't like the end twist. I personaly thought it was more cleaver then The Sixth Sense. But that's just my two cents worth.",10,1,1,17 August 2001
Scary Movie 2," Pointless, yet Funny...
","Scary Movie 2 is one of the most pointless, disgusting, and obscene films ever made. It is also pretty damn funny. The film has little plot. What plot it does have is basically a rip-off of 'The Haunting' and 'House on Haunted Hill.' From there we encounter our heros. Cindy (Anna Ferris), Ray (Shawn Waynes), Shorty (Marlon Waynes), and Brenda (Regina Hall) all return from Scary Movie. This is quite interesting because Ray and Shorty and Brenda all die in the first one. Go Figure. We encounter some new charecters as well. Christopher Masterson plays Cindys new 'buddy'. Tori Spelling plays a ditz (duh!) who isn't in the film too much. Tim Curry plays a sleaze ball professer, and Chris Elliot plays a sort of 'Igor' type charecter with a demented hand. All in all the film is funny. The story is nothing, but it is funny. I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",Null,0,1,8 July 2001
Cast Away," A Film That Proves The Triumph of the Human Spirit!!!
","I went to see Cast Away not knowing what to expect. There were many things that were said about the film that made me apprehensive about going to see it. People told me the film was boring and that there was not much dialogue. True, there is not much dialogue, but if you think about it, why would there be. He is stuck on an island by himself. The things that make this film interesting is the sheer fact that you feel as if you were there with you. I don't believe that the title refers to him as a 'Castaway' on an island, but in fact 'Cast Away' from the world and his friends and family. Tom Hanks is remarkable in this role. If he does not win an Academy Award for this role then there will be many upset people out there. Something that made this movie feel all the more intense is the fact that there is no music. All you hear are the waves, the wind, and the coconuts falling. It makes you feel like you are truly out on the edge of the world alone with nothing except some rocks and an old soccer ball named, Wilson. Cast Away is a an exceptional movie experience like none other. Joel Seigel said it best, 'Tom Hanks and Director Robert Zemekis have none the impossible...You will walk out of the theater in absolute awe.'",10,0,0,27 December 2000
Moulin Rouge!," A Triumph of Film!
","Moulin Rouge is one of the greatest experiences you will ever see presented on the silver screen. That is exactly what Moulin Rouge is, an experience, not a movie, but more of an experience that makes you believe in the awesome power of Truth, Beauty, Feedom, and Love. Baz Luhrmann's film allows the audience to go on a magical and awe-inspiring journey through the Bohemian Revlolution in 1900 Paris. We meet a young, pennyless poet named Christian, who travels to Paris to be a part of this renaissance of sorts. Christian moves into a small room across from the world famous Moulin Rouge nightclub, where he meets a small band of bohemians (no pun intended) who he helps write a show. Eventualy Christian meets Satine, a cortesan from the Moulin Rouge. The two become secret lovers and attepmt to foil the plans of the jelous Duke, who is financing the bohemian's play. The plot of Moulin Rouge takes a backseat to this mystical maze of song and dance that is executed with excellence. This is one film worth seeing, because it does what few films have ever done. It makes you believe in the power of film.",Null,0,0,4 August 2001
