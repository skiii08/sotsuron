Source Code," Gyllenhaal's best film? Yes
","Some movies have obscure plot lines, that are more easily understood on a visual platform rather than writing. But writing is all I've got, so here goes nothing.In the film, Source Code, Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up to find himself on a train headed for Chicago, with no idea how he got there. He starts talking to people on the train to try and figure what is happening but an explosion destroys the train and everyone aboard. Stevens then awakes in a chamber, unsure of where he is or what went on while he was on the train. A small screen in front of him shows a woman trying to give him instruction. Stevens discovers that a bomb has been planted on the train and he needs to find out who has done it, in order to stop a bigger catastrophe. He is continually sent back to the train with an 8 minute time frame to shut down the bomb and discover who has planted it. (Think the style of Groundhog Day).Confused? Doesn't matter. Source Code is worth the blurred storyline. You have to see this one for yourself to get a full grasp of what is happening. If you're worried you'll leave this one in a daze and unsure of what you just saw, put the worries aside. The dots get connected as the movie moves forward with an accelerating pace that never lets off the gas pedal. Gyllenhaal brings an outstanding performance to this sci-fi thriller. Amidst all the action, he doesn't let us forget about the human element, which brings Source Code to life.",8,1,3,7 April 2011
