Mission: Impossible III," MI3 Rocks!
","For MI Fans over the years, including those who enjoyed the TV series, this 3rd installment with Tom Cruise leading the charge will not disappoint. For others, this one will probably spurn a lot of DVD renting for the previous 2 editions. Action! Action! Action! This is what MI3 is all about. This movie takes it 'Up a Notch ( or 2)'. Enjoy folks. Well Directed!, Well Produced!, Well Acted. For those who need a tight plot line or perfectly sequenced answers to all of the tricks and treats in the movie - this may not be for you. For those that simply want to enjoy a great action movie for the summer, without worrying about perfectly sequenced dialog, this one is for you. Hang on to your seat rests, don't squeeze your date too tight when the suspense and tempo continues to climb. Enjoy! Enjoy! Enjoy!",10,0,1,2 June 2006
