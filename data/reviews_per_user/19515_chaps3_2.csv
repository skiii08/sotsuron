Requiem for a Dream," I still feel stunned
","I left the theater two hours ago and I still feel stunned.  When the film started I was struck by the unique and instantly coherent visual vocabulary. The split screens...the frenetic images.  Fueled by a quirky, driving Kronos Quartet score.  There was a sense of humor about the bleak relationship between Sara Goldfarb and her son.  The running gag about him selling her TV for drug money.  From the opening sequences and what I'd read in reviews, I felt that I was on recognizable ground.  That I could watch from a safe vantage point as the story unfolded and enjoy the edginess of the plot and break away clean.But somewhere in the midst of it, I felt myself drawn closer to the action. Sensing more and more that I somehow physically understood what was happening to Sara even though I'd never been there.  And by the end, I felt sick.  I felt my boundaries had dissolved.  I felt a physical connection with what was happening on the screen.  The sound and the image invaded me and I felt physically sick, assaulted, wasted.I don't think I've ever felt that way in a movie.  The ugliness and the horror completely engulfed my personal space.  I was not safe.I can't really recommend this movie because it was so graphically disturbing...I would not want the responsibility of sharing the experience. But if someone has the courage or strength to face it, they will be confronted by a seamless experience that wastes no time setting a stage for the viewer, but plugs directly, like electrodes, into their mind.",9,0,0,2 February 2001
The Wizard of Oz," The most important American movie ever.
","The most important American movie ever made. It drew the line between the American Dream and the European fairytale tradition of princes and happiness in far away castles ever-after. It is who we are and what we believe. Everything you need is in yourself - you only have to find out how to use it and this you must accomplish on your own. No one can give it to you. It is the American Mythology. In a way, it is our shared religion. It shatters the notion of class distinctions. Dorothy doesn't become a princess, she becomes herself.",10,5,8,2 September 2008
