The Avengers," Due to Computer generated imagery (CGI) effects the film is watchable
","Where do I start, OK, superheroes saving the earth from aliens, a recurrent and also favorite theme for the Hollywood to score big at box office.This film is watchable due to CGI effects. Why this film is such a box office hit? Well, may be because of underlying desire of every human being to be a hero in one way or the other.Eccentric super heroes and silly story dominates the film. The story is for kids not for me as I couldn't connect with it. In conclusion, go and enjoy this film for its CGI effects and Physics defying stunts.",6,1,4,16 April 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Too much of anything is good for nothing
","If I have to rephrase this: 'Too many cooks spoil the broth' then it will be something like this 'Too many superheroes will spoil the action movie'. I came to this conclusion after watching this movie.I got headache after viewing this movie. In I,Robot and Terminator, we have Artificial Intelligence (A.I) as the villain. Same goes here as well but one distinction is we have another A.I 'Vision' as an Avenger. One can understand the story from trailer itself. Villain 'Ultron' believes Humans are dangerous to the world peace and therefore from their extinction world peace is possible. He then enacts a plan to kill all Humans, only to be stopped by Avengers. Such a wafer thin plot is stretched to almost two and half hours by including action sequences and lame background of the Superheroes. Why I didn't liked this movie? May be I have grown up questioning myself more about who I am? What is the reason for my existence?... etc.This movie is for those who don't question and accept things as they are.",5,4,12,24 April 2015
Taken," Paris is a world class city and police are highly efficient there
","Watching this movie made me mystified as the core plot of the film is based on kidnapping in Paris. I got so many beautiful memories when I lived in Paris. It is truly a safe city and have got a strong police presence.Having said that the film was very emotional and a thriller. It is watchable but a 50 plus year old hero bringing down thugs with a single punch is somewhat doubtful. However, Liam Neeson as a father in this film makes a great screen presence. One can overlook plot holes because of his acting and also his love for his daughter.Go and watch this film because Liam Neeson will spellbound you with his on screen portraying of a father who can go to any lengths to save his daughter from kidnappers.",7,1,1,16 April 2015
