United 93," This is MUST viewing for any loyal American (over the age of approx. 15 due to R rating).
","This movie is MUST viewing for any loyal American (over age 15 due to R). We forget tooooo quickly 9/11. Remember how shocked we were, how it actually United us...U.S.? Well, this well done film does the same. I would have preferred cutting out the final text giving critical comments to our government/air controllers...let the film be about the United 93 heres. When 9/11 happened there were actually some Americans who said 'it was OUR fault'. This movie clearly shows the motivation behind the terrorists. They will continue to do their evil if allowed, of course. In the meantime, let's not forget the debt we owe to our fellow Americans aboard United 93! The only other critical comment (other than what I mentioned) is that Todd Beamer's character is absent. Your fellow American, Gratefully, John",10,0,2,3 October 2006
