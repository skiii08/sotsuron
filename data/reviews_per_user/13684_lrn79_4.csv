"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Nice night for it.
","I have seen this movie maybe 20 times and never get sick of it. I laugh just as much now as I did when I first saw it at the cinema in 94. It was the first gay themed movie I'd seen and because it was so popular to the mainstream I could see it and quote it for months (years) afterwards that no-one cared. Sure these characters are steriotypes of gay men, but we have 'the Sum Of Us' to counter act that. You're just ment to watch it and p**s your self laughing. Not every gay film has to be 'real' or serious, sometimes we just have to laugh!ps. I went to Broken Hill, and that pub with the pianted walls is even more 'tack-a-ramma' in the flesh!",9,1,2,2 May 2002
The Red Violin," Interesting, but not engrossing.
","This film is well made with a great concept, looks beautiful (great cinematography), has beautiful music and a little twist at the end, but it falls short of a masterpiece. I feel each story was too rushed with the Shanghai story, potentially the most interesting, over almost before it has begun. The Viola family is my favourate of classical instruments, and the musical score is delightful. Worth a watch (and a listen)5/10",5,1,3,1 August 2002
Shrek," cold have been so much better
","There were so many possibilities for gags that just didn't appear. Instead of just giving all the lines to the donkey there could have been a great oppertunity to have more fun with the fairytale creatures. Mike Myers voice talent was waisted. And I know its aimed at kids and plot isn't of the upmost importance, but why was Farquaad getting rid of the fairytale folk? I guess it was so he could have his prefect world, but it wasn't really explored. And please, no more Matrix jokes!",5,0,0,19 August 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," not a coen great
","I love the Coens humour, i love most of their movies, but this one left me saying ho-hum. It was enjoyable and querky but nothing special. The screenplay just seemed to wonder on without much direction. Redeeming moment; Clooney's performance (the Cary Grant of our time?)and the truly Coen-esque ending. 5/10",7,0,0,17 August 2001
