The Devil's Advocate," Keanu's deal with the devil
","I don't think you could put this movies in a particular catagory. It's not quite a drama and it's not quite a thriller but a bit of both. Both the movie is good, for instead of making the devil just a blood thirsty killer, it's based on temptation. Al Pacino lives in a world of beautiful women, money, power, and no guilt. There is a lot of nudity and extreme violence in this movie, but if it wasn't there the movies purpose and story wouldn't work. The final half of this movie put me in more suspense then any movie has in a long time. In conclusion, don't miss this film.",Null,78,111,12 August 1998
The Big Lebowski," Start's ok at first, and then it totally falls apart.
","'The Big Lebowski' opening had me laughing, as well as it was doing for the first little while. The movie is weird, and it get stranger and stranger until the characters, plot and situations get on my nerves, especially the Dude's dreams. Not worth watching, not even for free.",Null,0,1,14 September 1998
Happy Gilmore," He doesn't play golf... He destroys it
","'Happy Gilmore' reminded me of what great comedy is like. It is Adam Sandlers best work. There was hardly a joke in this movie that I didn't laugh at. You want to laugh, really laugh, rent this movie.",Null,2,2,17 August 1998
The Fifth Element," A silly future flick
","You can tell by watching this movie that a lot of work was put into it(it costs $90 million). But the story, like many furture movies, is rediculous. Also, the pacing is very slow. There are only two good parts in the movie. A little editing, and some better writing would have done this movie some good, instead of what we end up with.",Null,1,2,16 August 1998
Spice World," IT SUCKS!!
","I am not going to get into any detail about the many reasons this movie sucks, but I will say it is so bad, I couldn't even watch all of it.",Null,0,1,11 August 1998
Face_Off," More than an action movie
","Many action movies cannot develop characters very well. 'FACE/OFF' does. In it is a mixed of outstanding action, explosions, and stunts; and great performances from the whole cast, especially Trovolta and Cage, making the characters interesting. I was with this movie from beginning to end. Check it out. You will not regret it.",Null,0,0,6 August 1998
Dark City," Great effects, but minor story
","This movie tries to do what 'Star Wars' did for sci-fi movies. It introduces a brand new concept the public either gets into or doesn't. I can't say that I am one who got into this movie. I am not saying I hated it, the effects were great, the acting was too, but the idea didn't seem to interest me.",Null,0,0,15 August 1998
Independence Day," Satisfiying
","I liked this movie. It has action, blinding special effects, and lots of humor. Basically, that's all you need to make a popular movie these days. I recommend it.",Null,0,1,6 August 1998
Good Will Hunting," Predictable, but entertaining
","This movie has a very simple and predictable plot, but the performances and characters save the movie. The characters talk about their lives, make jokes, give advice to each other, stand up for each other, and have fun. The witty screenplay, and the characters are what make the movie entertaining.",Null,0,2,11 August 1998
Event Horizon," Infinite Space... Infinite Boredom
","This movie tries everything to shock you, scare you, whatever. It just doesn't work. The movie is a good set up, but like a lot of horror movies, once we know what the threat is, there is nothing to build on.",Null,0,1,10 August 1998
Men in Black," Will vs. the Aliens
","An enjoyable movie which teams two great actors (Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith) together in a movie of laughs, action and special effects. However, the movie wasn't on the top 250. Until 'Titanic' I would have expected this movie to be hailed by the people as the best of 97. I guess I just expected too much.",Null,1,2,10 August 1998
Scream 2," Good, but not great
","I enjoyed 'Scream 2' for the most part. It does some things right, but some things wrong as well. The right thing it does is that the characters who did survive the first one are smarter and know a lot more about the situation they are in. Also, like the first dwelled on scary movies, this one dwells on sequels.The clever script and direction is all there, and yet there are problems. The movie doesn't have the same scary settings as the first one, like the house at the memerable finish of 'Scream.' The killer is also more predictable, especially for people who saw the orginal. Still, the blood and gore , and witty screen writing, direction and performances are still enough to make this movie enjoyable. Although, I have doubts that 'Scream 3' will manage as the first two did, but you never know.",Null,0,0,5 August 1998
Kingpin," A Good Time
","'Kingpin' is a hilarious, laugh at loud comedy. But what Farrelly Brother's movie isn't. See this and every other movie they made.",Null,0,0,17 October 1998
Scream," A breakthrough in movie history
","Not even close to the average horror movie, 'Scream' finally changes the rules. The characters are smart and interesting, instead of victums making the same supid mistakes (I don't have to tell you them). The script, the actors, the direction; it's all perfect. The first original horror movie in a vey long time.",Null,0,0,5 August 1998
The Wedding Singer," Very funny
","'The Wedding Singer' is not Adam Sandlers best work, I thought he was best in 'Happy Gilmore.' Still, he'll still keep you laughing till the end of this movie. Drew Barrymore is also great as the innocent Julia. There are also very funny cameos by Billy Idol and Steve Busiemi.",Null,2,2,5 August 1998
Jurassic Park," When Dinosaurs roamed the earth
","I have seen this movie many times, and I still like watching it. The special effects are fantastic and the acting and characters are excellent as well. See It!",Null,4,6,10 August 1998
