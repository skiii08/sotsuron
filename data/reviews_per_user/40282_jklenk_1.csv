The Ring," I now have Seven Days...
","Here is a brief guide to viewing this movie:1) Do not watch it alone 2) See it in a crowded theater 3) Bring a camera. You will want to take a picture of yourself before and after you see it. 4) Do not see it with loved ones 5) Do not travel aloneThis is the most frightening film I have ever experienced. I saw this film with a small group of film fanatics. When the movie ended, we emerged from the theater pale and breathless. No one dared to walk to their cars alone.
We then departed our separate ways and spent the night awake. Graphic images from the experience haunted our minds and made us restless.This film does not contain a lot of blood or gore, but delves deep into your Psyche. Experience this film and you will be restless too.*Spoiler Warning* Anything you read about this movie is a potential spoiler. Do not read any review if you do not want your experience spoiled!",9,0,0,11 October 2002
