Changeling," A Perfect Cinematic Experience
","Wow! This is real Cinema. Haven't had that for a while! Clint Eastwood is amazing! He really captured the era and the whole mood was just mesmerizing. Angelina Joli made me feel every emotion! She must win an Oscar for her performance. She just must! Everything about this film is Perfect. The music, the costumes, the filming, the actors,...Everything! I watched this with my mom and sister. We all equally enjoyed it and were absolutely taking by it, talking about it still! We were holding our breath till the end, really hoping that Angelina would find her son. I will not spoil anything here so go ahead and see for yourself. You will not regret watching this stunning film. I was really disappointed that Changeling is not Oscar nominated for Best Picture and Directing. How sad is that!?!..Anyway this is one film I won't mind seeing more then once!",8,6,9,16 February 2009
The Wrestler," You Don't Need to Like Wrestling to Love This Film
","At first I thought I wouldn't really like this film because wrestling and wrestlers never interested me at all. But I love watching good acting so I gave this film a shot for the sake of Mickey Rourke. I was really surprised and glad that I did give this film a shot! The Wrestler is a film that can completely transport you into the heart and soul of a wrestler if you let it. Mickey Rourke really did such an amazing job. He had me thinking about the character for days. He deserved the Golden Globe and if he does win an Oscar, I wouldn't be surprised at all! The chemistry between Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei was also great in this film.If you like seeing something different for a change or like watching real emotions on screen, u have to see this film!",9,0,0,18 February 2009
