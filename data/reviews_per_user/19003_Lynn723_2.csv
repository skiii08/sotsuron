The Blair Witch Project," Make sure you are in a comfortable seat, or bed while you watch this movie.
","This was the dumbest movie I have ever seen. It is nothing but shots of faces, and darkness. I have been more scared sitting in a well lit room with 20 friends, then while watching this movie. It may have been more frightening if they never said it was fake. But, since we know it is not real, what is so scary? I will say the very end was great. It was a nice touch, and the only worth while scene, but that does not make the movie worth seeing. I suggest watching the first 15-20 minutes, and then fast forward to the last 5 minutes!",3,0,1,24 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," This is no ordinary day in The Park!
","Parker and Stone have outdone themselves this time. This movie has it all. They left no stone unturned this time. It was truly Bigger, Longer and Uncut. This movie made up for all the things missed in the t.v. series. I highly recommend going to see this movie. But, leave the kids and senior citizens at home.",9,0,0,1 July 1999
