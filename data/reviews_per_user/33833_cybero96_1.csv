Requiem for a Dream," Unsettelingly brilliant
","Requiem for a Dream sticks. After watching the whole thing all the way through there wasn't a single scene that I couldn't look back on and think how utterly brilliant it was.While the start sets the scene in an almost clich√© drug dealing VS proper morale mood, that all changes when the plot of the movie is observed. Each of the four main characters faces their own trials and tribulations, and each of them their pride before their fall.What strikes me most about Requiem is that although society tells us that we shouldn't be aligning ourselves with any of the characters because of their disgusting addictions I couldn't help feeling more emotionally attached to the cast than any movie I've ever seen. Each character fell prey to similar addictions but entirely different one's all the same. Each character was warped by their method to succeed, and that's what made it so brutishly heart wrenching.The ending was so beautifully crafted I ended up praying it would could keep going - the additions of wonderfully simplistic editing and soundtrack really encapsulated me.If you are looking for permanent emotional damage, and a fantastic narrative that explores the unsettling nature of addiction abuse - watch this film.",9,1,2,15 September 2013
