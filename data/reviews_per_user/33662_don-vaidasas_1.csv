Source Code," Illogical, disappointing
","The hole technology on which movie's story is based was conflicting with the story itself so badly that it ruined the movie (even for a sci-fi lover as myself). And it comes in 15min.. I tried to forget that illogical details and enjoy the movie, but the end just 'killed' me. If the movie would end 10 minutes earlier, I would put much better vote. But now the movie could be rated good only if you didn't understand the hole concept then comes 'wow - how nice...', but if you follow the story and have logical thinking - you'll be very disappointed. The acting wasn't so bad as many reviewers said, the hole story was a bit banal and in such case you can't act neither brilliant neither bad.",4,16,30,16 April 2011
