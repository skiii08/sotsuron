Requiem for a Dream," Great cinematography!
","I recently saw this movie for the first time. The first thing i noticed was the well-done cinematography. The graphic shots and the tension on screen was very impressive and played well with the eye. As the story progressed, i could almost tell what was going to happen, but even when what i said would happen happened, i was shocked! As well as the visual shots, the musical score for this movie was fantastic. The thing I was mostly blown away by was the storyline and the arrangement of the shots. The quick shots while they were doing drugs or such would really hit you and make you feel as if you were the one doing them. It was a little graphic at parts, but I think that it is understandable considering the situation at hand. My heart really went out to Harry and his mother. Their acting was superb and really ripped out my heart with their personal problems and addictions. I almost cried at the end of this movie, i was so emotionally shocked.",9,0,1,2 January 2006
