United 93," more impact than expected
","Taking an event such as 93 and providing additional information of things and agencies concurrently going on made this a very in the sit of the plane experience. The camera angles are made as if you are sitting in the plane. It blew me away. I highly recommend it. Not what I expected and more real than I could handle. It's dangerous to write films about events that are very current. This was so worth the experience. I bought the DVD. I don't know that I could have handled the big screen. Perhaps this should be shown in the school systems in US. Americans banding together so quickly to fight for their lives, normal people, reaching a consensus to survive. It's amazing. They are heroes.",10,1,3,9 September 2006
