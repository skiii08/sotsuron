The Incredible Hulk," The Best Yet
","I liked the first Hulk movie because it was the Hulk, a Marvel character that I was so familiar with as a child reading comic books, watching cheesy animations and watching the TV series. THIS Hulk movie is more like tha actually Incredible Hulk I know and closer to the series.The Hulk in this movie was like the actually comic book character where he actually speaks and comprehends. The first Hulk movie showed him as a mindless brute. Also the first movie put too much emphassis on a relationship between Bruce Banner and his father David. And the new (original?) Hulk has more emotion.Choosing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner was perfect. Besides Norton's acting, his small frame helped create the contrast between Bruce and the Hulk alter ego.There are a couple of cameos and some winks to the fans. Can't tell you what those are, that would be a spoiler. :) This movie had great live action/CG mix with camera pans that were flawless increasing the effectiveness of the illusion.The true Incredible Hulk or Marvel fan will love this movie.",10,5,9,26 June 2008
Deja Vu," Cool Concept
","I really liked the idea of using wormhole technology to view the past optically and aurally. Despite the fact that the director didn't 'want' to make a sci-fi, it turned out to be a very good sci-fi. Smart move to go sci-fi and not sci-fact. If the movie would've just used satellite technology as a basis, I wouldn't have like it as much. Especially since time travel is a part of the story. Hello? Time travel is sci-fi Mr. Director! Other than that, the movie was well done. I very much appreciated the car chase where Danzel's character is car chasing a villain while the villain is in the past and Danzel is in the present. Very cool concept... Wish I would've thought of it first! (Damn.) I also appreciated the director going with practical effects instead of computer effects. I love computer effects, but if you have the 'money' try the practical first.",9,1,2,2 May 2007
Interstellar," One of the better Sci-Fi moral/relationship stories
","I just watched the movie 'Interstellar'. Awesome movie. It was a tear jerker for me. It had a daughter/father thing going on, which most of you wouldn't know about that type of situation. I wasn't merely having tears, I actually started bawling for at least 3 points in the story. It had a good time paradox thingy going on as well. Powerful story concept if you have an open mind to the possibilities of our actual existence in this universe. Great acting in all characters. Kudos to Matthew David McConaughey, Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. The other actors also did a great job.OIf course, there is also the moral dilemma of what to do when trying to save the Earth and, more personally, we humans. The only issue I have is... Who are 'they'? No depth at all into that. I think we are supposed to create our own 'they' this story. Either one we pick, the story of this movie fits.One of the few movies that has actual meaningful depth in its overall story.",10,3,7,17 March 2015
Transformers," Transdisappointed
","They have all that money and great special effects and no imagination! Maybe they were going for the Transformer fan. Obviously not for the sci-fi or fantasy fan.They even threw in a few cute factors. After I saw the first one, I almost left the theater. I was thinking, 'You've have got to be kidding me.' Cute is one thing, but the tooth fairy bit, that was lame. I think Spielberg has been hanging around Lucas too much.Seriously. Find a 'writer' next time. This was obviously written by marketing. If it weren't for the cast and special effects, it wouldn't have been worth my time and money. This movie's story/plot is like water in a sieve. Perhaps the Transformer fans could see the Transformer story bits, but that is all there was. They tried adding other alien urban legend type of references, but it didn't help. In fact very contrived.Perhaps a different director would've worked, unless this one's hands were tied. Then I would feel sorry for him.How about throwing some of that money at us creative filmmakers?? Vive Le indie!!",4,2,6,7 July 2007
Sinister," Mystical Yet Sinister
","Very Well Done! There is a certain story device Scott Derrickson uses, and he uses it well. (Sorry for the vagueness, trying not to spoil) I was immersed (or is it coerced) into a dream-like fascination for the story. It was a surrealistic roller coaster ride.I clapped for Ethan Hawk's performance. He helped with the immersion into the story.The basic story level was rather simple. But the layers started adding up. The suspense was suspended by Ethan's character studying the 'planted' evidence he found in his newly-moved-in home. We find out something mystical yet sinister.The lighting of the movie enhanced the overall mood and atmosphere. Very fitting! I enjoyed this movie tremendously. I haven't seen such an ensemble of story, direction and acting all in the same movie in a long while. Let's make more like this!",10,2,3,24 February 2013
