Ford v Ferrari," WOW!!!
","This is why I love going to big screen cinemas.
Larger than life and immersive theatre. What an amazing experience. A petrolhead's dream movie.Bale is fantastic as always, Damon solid and the rest of the cast good.The racing is extraordinary. Such fantastic cinematography.If you love cars, history, or just a good movie, this is for you!",10,2,6,19 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," NOTHING PHANTOM ABOUT THIS MENACE
","Certainly must rate as the worst in the franchise. Terrible on so many fronts. Awful plot, bad characters and some of the most wooden, emotionless performances I have ever seen from some terrific actors.Some great special effects but really, what was Lucas thinking with Jar Jar Binks? So irritating!!Overall a very disappointing 2 hours...",4,2,6,7 October 2019
Sucker Punch," SUCK IT UP
",This is a great fun little movie in the style of Sin City. Great action and styling supports a quirky plot. Different and adventurous.Great cinematography and CG.Well worth the watch.,7,5,6,14 May 2020
Child 44," Solid, gritty but...
","Really enjoyed the movie up till the happy, sachirine ending. I also didn't quite get how the hero gets out of the hole he finds himself in at the end. Sad, as I really enjoyed the grey, grittiness of the cinematography as well as the characters.Bottom-line, enjoyable for 90% spoiled by a disappointing and at times illogical plot. The fact that the villain can happily shoot anyone he pleases, even a colleague in the back in his office, without explanation or consequence yet he has multiple opportunities to kill the hero, with reason, but had to resort to hiring 4 gangsters to murder him in a crowded prison carriage in a highly complex and ultimately ineffective plot. Completely farcical!",5,0,1,12 December 2018
Rocketman," Hater of musicals getting teary
","I really do not like musicals. Poncing about to theatrically styled music is definitely not for me. Thus I was bowled over by this. An emotional rollercoaster filled with so many memories of my own youth fuelled by so many of Elton's forgotten masterpieces.Incredibly well cast, directed, scripted and styled. The right balance of fantasy and gritty reality.Truly memorable performances.And I wasn't embarrassed by my tears. ðŸ˜…",8,2,3,3 June 2019
The Death of Stalin," BLACK RUSSIAN
","Terrific black comedy. The comedic equivalent of Downfall. Both covering the chaotic demise of notoriously evil despots.Fantastic cast, hilarious script and characters. One wonders even in comedy, how close to reality this really was.A cinematic delight!",10,2,3,2 January 2020
Train to Busan," ONE OF THE BEST ZOMBIE MOVIES EVER
","Honestly, I love Korean movies, and am obsessed with Zombie movies. Parasite showed the broader world how Koreans cab make a great movie, but honestly, I think this is better.Without a doubt, in the top 3 zombie apocalypse movies ever.Enjoy the ride!!",10,2,3,30 March 2020
Captain Marvel," Shallow feminist fun
","The movie is OK. Not to be taken seriously. I certainly believe the writers, director and actors didn't take it seriously. It felt like it was written by AI and the two dimensionality of the actors made it feel as though they could have been fully CG as opposed to the partial, but heavy handed, CG enhanced products we are faced with.That said, it was okay. Sometimes you want a Big Mac instead of a steak dinner and that's OK. This was a Good Big Mac.",6,4,9,8 March 2019
Green Room," MORON ROOM
","Look, I know it's a 'horror' movie and horror movies are supposed to have stupid victims. But really, can you possibly get more stupid and irritating victims than this bunch?Technically ok I guess, but all you can do is cringe at how dumb they are. Even the obligatory, 'I think we should split up'",4,4,6,17 May 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," A BIT OF FUN
","A cute little movie with a few laughs, tongue in cheek moments and some ok music. Not bad.",6,2,4,5 July 2020
The Irishman," EPIC OLD SCHOOL GANGSTER FLICK
","This is an old school Scorsese delight! Star power all over the screen. CGI to blow your mind (not in an action movie kind of way).This is a perfect example of the lost art of film making that Scorsese laments. He, again, tries to teach us what a movie should be.Great characters, strong plot, engaging script.Kudos to Netflix for producing this.
Unmissable!!",7,2,5,2 December 2019
The Fifth Element," IN MY ELEMENT!
","Such a great movie. Groundbreaking on so many levels.
Entertainment at its best.
So stylish, fun and genius!!Must watch!",9,4,5,22 January 2020
127 Hours," IT HAD ME STUMPED!
","Watching this is not for the squeamish but it really is quite armless. The ending does make it worthwhile tho.Franco is excellent and Boyle, as always, solid. Tough subject matter to make a full length movie from.",7,1,1,7 June 2020
Superbad," SUPERGOOD
",Everything that Good Boys aspired to be but failed miserably.Complete anarchic fun. Great early career performances from Hill and Cerra.Oldie but a classic!,8,7,8,19 December 2019
Aquaman," Didn't meet my high expectations
","I have been looking forward to this all year, ever since the cameo in Justice League. Sadly it wasn't worth the wait. Ok CGI, but too many monsters, and over the top CGI. Not enough Aquaman bashing baddies.Bad dialogue, no chemistry and weak biting plot. Still, OK popcorn movie. DC still struggles greatly against Marvel",6,1,6,27 December 2018
The Terminator," AHEAD OF ITS TIME
","Just watched it again. What a classic!!I remember watching it on my own in a cinema in Johannesburg, sneaking out from work. And nearly dying with fright and nerves. The only movie scarier at the time was Jaws!What a cracker!!",10,1,3,12 December 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Waited a while to see, but so so worth it!!
","Excellent tale of redemption, courage, humanity and dark humour. Thoroughly enjoyable romp through the lives of Trump's heartland supporter base. Racist, misogynistic and backward, yet, amongst it all, a raw humour and integrity.A must see!!",9,1,3,7 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," AWESOME CG AND ACTION, BUT....
","The fight amongst the ocean waves must be one of the best CG scenes ever. In fact this is a must see on IMAX. Loved the grandeur of the backdrops and the action is amazing. Eye popping!!That said, still really irritating huggy/crying/heroic characters that are best suited to a Disney kiddy movie. Aaarrrrggggghhhh!
So sickly sweet. Even the villains are cute. OMFG.
And the ridiculous flip flopping of evil villain/considerate hero who may or may not be somebody's child/sibling guided by someone who is dead/undead. The same endlessly boring narrative of of the last 3 movies continues unabated in neverending circles of who the hell cares..Still, a must see for the great action and CG!!",7,4,21,19 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," BOHEMIAN AGONY
",I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes before my irritation with Freddie overwhelmed me. Also the choppy plot and lack of character development was simply too irksome.,3,2,6,11 April 2020
Bird Box," So so
","Good start, good tension but it meanders along with constant implausability. Some good acting and reasonable pace. Certainly better than The Happening as commented by other reviewers.No reason for the events but it is a horror/thriller so I guess that's OK. It is definitely a step up from the average and there is not much of the standard ridiculous stupidity found in horror film victims but the blind action scenes are as implausible as Scent of a Women. (One of the more ridiculous movies ever made)
Tense and watchable but average...",5,2,6,10 January 2019
Watchmen," Don't Watchmen
","Some nice costumes, some good characters caught up in a confused muddle of soporific pontificating and philosophies, God complexes and self loathing. Some good action scenes with excessive and patently unnecessary gore. Many boring boring talking heads scenes and generally convoluted and meandering script.The pacing is perfectly bad up until the end where the world is decimated by horrific mass genocide in key cities across the globe which leads to all the survivors singing Kumbaya and holding hands. But no, that's not the final scene. The final scene is one of a boring domestic interaction set in one of those cities with no evidence of the recent genocide and destruction. I guess the point of it all is that it dreary little ant-like lives continue even after God kicks our anthill over. Or some such drivel...",5,1,13,8 September 2019
Split," Excellent thriller worth the hype
","Not a usually a huge 'M. Night' Shyamalan fan but this is a very slick, multi-layered thriller with a truly fantastic performance by James McAvoy, ably supported by Anya Taylor-Joy. Well worth the watch. Can't wait for the sequel!",8,1,2,10 January 2019
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," GETTING DEWEY COX
",Really good parody of the latest musical biopic fad. Some good fun slapstick humour and surprisingly good musical score.I am guessing not for everyone but worth a watch!,7,1,1,3 April 2020
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," PILGRIM'S PROGRESSIVE
","This is one cracking movie. Hilarious, stylish, genius. Really really clever. And did I say fun? FUN FUN FUN!This is a classic! Don't miss this!!",10,2,2,12 May 2020
Yesterday," OK idea saved by the music
","I was really looking forward to this movie given its unique premise but was disappointed with the weak storyline, over the top acting and lack of laughs.The continued vanishing of additional pop culture 'names' were pointless and didn't generate laughs or add to the plot.In fact the plot meanders with our hero caught between his moral dilemma, childhood love interest and a yearning for success. Similarly the plot meanders between a soppy and superficial love story, a musical and a very poor attempt at comedy.Fortunately, the film is saved, in part, by the forgotten heroes, The Beatles. Their music joyously punctuates this otherwise soporific offering.Watch it if you're a fan of The Beatles but don't expect a good movie.",5,0,1,21 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Crammed fun that can't be avoided
","Honestly, I think there are too many Heroes for one movie so Thanos definitely helped us out. That said, the writers do exceptionally well to weave all the back stories, relationships, characters and emotional hee-haw together in one crazy 3 hour rollercoaster ride of CG action, emotion and gags.Great fun but I yearn for the simpler single hero movies of yore, even though I still think the first Avengers movie was the Greatest!!!That said, this will break every box office record as it is a MUST SEE!!!",8,2,8,24 April 2019
1941," 1941? AN OLDIE BUT A GOODIE
","This is a crazy slapstick movie. Jim Belushi at his best. Ackroyd, Williams all fun.The whole time I was watching I was thinking how Trump would run a real war. A fantastic simulation!! ðŸ˜…",7,1,1,6 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Crazy arsed fun masterpiece
","I must preempt this by saying I an a huge Tarantino fan. Now I can say this is not his usual fare.Really good fun and full of surprises. Leo, Brad and Margot are sensational. The script hilarious and every scene a delight.A few laugh out loud moments and hooting by the audience. It really transports you to Hollywood in the 60s/70s.Tarantino's attention to detail is exquisite. This is really not to be missed!Please God don't let it be Tarantino's last!!!",10,28,45,15 August 2019
School of Rock," A DIAMOND
",This is a classic. No two ways about it. So many movies have tried to emulate it but none have come close.Don't miss this this little rock/comedy gem!,10,0,0,21 December 2019
Coco," CRIED LIKE A BABY
","What a fantastic little movie. Great story, full of suspense, twists and unbelievable characters and animation.Certainly the best animated feature I have seen!!",10,0,0,21 November 2019
1917," I FELT AS IF I HAD BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH BARBED WIRE
","Wow! The camera work, the sets, the cinematography. Unreal because it was so real. You feel as though you are part of this epic the entire way through.I felt a little overcome at times but then I guess this heightened the sense of being in the action.Loved that the director didn't overplay the heroism or the horror or the pathos. Just in your face realism. Obviously there was a lot of over the top action and plot twists, it is a movie. But, what a movie!A must, must see!!!",9,0,0,28 February 2020
Silence," I WAS HOPING FOR MY OWN HEAD TO BE CHOPPED OFF
","This is a loooooong, perhaps not entirely boring as the intermittent torture helps pep things up.I am not sure if this was intended as a pro Christianity epic, but it merely served to reinforce the sad implications of ignorant masses devoutly following religious doctrines, which they really don't understand, to their deaths. All in the hope of escaping their miserable earthly existence.This movie is akin to the other religious disaster, The Passion of Christ. I guess if you're a keen flagellant, this movie is a must!!Oh, and Andrew Garfield is completely miscast!! Adam Driver is great and Liam Neeson, another casting error.Some nice cinematography, and costumes save this from a 1 star. If you really want to watch an excellent missionary movie, watch The Mission. Oh and it has a real actor in it, de Niro... Nuff said",3,2,2,1 April 2020
Hotel Mumbai," BREATHLESS
","This is a really good movie. Well paced, great direction, not overly cheesy and managed to convey a good balance of horror, heroism and pathos.It really brings home the stark reality of what it must be like to be caught up in a sustained terror attack. Terrifying is the operative word. It makes one think how you would behave in a similar situation.The fact that so many staff stayed and died protecting their guests was well portrayed.A terrific movie about humanity and inhumanity.",8,5,33,1 April 2020
Everest," NEVER REST
","This is an excellent movie. Good acting, great script and terrifying plot. Honestly, it is difficult for me to find any sympathy for any of the characters tho. At no stage does the movie give any appearance of professionalism or low risk. Anybody who ventures up on this crazed escapade does so with full knowledge that he or she is putting his own life and that of others at extreme risk. Zero sympathy when that eventuates. Choice! And ego!!",8,2,2,8 June 2020
Midsommar," MIDSLUMBERFEST
","OMFG. Two and a half hours of my life wasted. Thank goodness they were on a long haul flight killing time.Seriously, what an awfully drawn out bunch of claptrap. 20 minutes max and even then no amount of editing could make sense of this drivel.Please avoid it at all costs.",2,4,12,29 January 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," LEGENDARY
","A fantastic mockumentary! I feel quite embarrassed that I hadn't seen it before. Seriously, hilariously excellent. It really could be real.Michael McKean is unrecognisable and superb. Wow.If you love music, enjoy a good laugh, you will love this.",10,1,1,20 April 2020
Stalingrad," THE ART OF WAR
","This is a beautifully crafted love story set in the horrors of the Russian war with Germany. The cinematography is extraordinary. It really carries you into the heart of war torn Stalingrad in 1942.It is difficult to call this a war movie even though it is non stop action, violence and death. It is a simple love story of 5 brave soldiers and their love for one dogged and Indestructable woman who refuses to leave her home in the face of powerful forces of evil.And yet, those same forces are shown to be human too. Such a stunning epic. Funny, poignant, heroic, sad and dramatic.A building that bleeds red dust that refuses to die.Wow!",10,2,4,24 March 2020
The King," KING HIT
","A very very good movie. After a slow start, the movie really picks up pace once Edgerton gets involved. He is excellent as always. Chalamet is excellent too as the young Henry and I honestly didn't recognise Pattinson. He is really really good.Overall a very good watch. Without a doubt one of Netflix's better efforts.",8,2,2,17 June 2020
Departures," Passionate art
","This is a beautiful piece of art. Fantastic insight into Japanese culture and rituals, but most importantly about self respect and dealing with abandonment.A stylishly made, directed and acted little gem of a movie. No surprise at its awards.",8,1,2,7 October 2019
Joker," WRONG CONTEXT
","This is a good movie. Dark, tragic and brooding. So many excellent aspects to it. Great acting, sets, costumes. Fantastic score.But...The context is that this is The Joker of Batman Nemeses notoriety. The film just doesn't fit. Arthur is a truly sad and tragic, disturbed and intellectually challenged character. His back story is deeply disturbing and one cannot help but feel sympathy if not empathy. The REAL Joker is not a sad victim. He is a malevolent, intelligent maniac. Not someone you have an ounce of sympathy for.I think this movie fails because of this context. If it was purely a study into the psychological development of a sociopath I think it would be excellent. Sadly it is not. It is the origin story of a comic book baddie. Nothing comic book baddie about this miserable human.There are a few other issues I had with it, there primary one being that he is incapable of coherent speech and social interaction throughout the movie but he suddenly is able to produce a powerful monologue on set in front of a live audience and in front of TV cameras and his former idol. I understand that his confidence grows the less he has to lose but I found this jarring and dissonant.I also found his fantasy relationship silly and then overly 'explained'.That aside, Joachim is phenomenal!! A one man tour de force. Truly believable if not relatable.This is a must see for his performance but I think Batman fans will be disappointed.",6,68,172,3 October 2019
Downfall," EXCEPTIONAL
","This is a great movie. Great acting, script, sets, and cinematography. This is a really different movie. Absolutely engrossing. Really believable.Ironically there is one scene from this movie that has been used in numerous occasions for comedy. This is an intensely sad movie. Not the death of Hitler nor his insane accolytes. But the demise of a country caught up in the whirlwind of fanaticism. The deaths of 50,000 million people all summed up in one crazed final act.This is a must see for anyone with an interest in history or politics.",10,2,2,11 December 2019
12 Strong," THOR POINT
","Look, this is loosely based on an apparent action in Afghanistan. My guess is the reality was nothing at all like this, but..If you treat it as an action war flick meant to entertain with tonnes of action, immortal American Heroes (Hemsworth is Thor after all) and simple tribesman needing saving by said heroes, then you will enjoy it. Comic book fun.Realistic war epic, most definitely not!",6,3,4,29 December 2019
Parasite," PARA-CRAZY
","This is a fun, different movie. But, to be totally honest, as a lover of Asian cinema, not that different. For example Thirst by Park Chan-Wook is off the charts different. But, an ok, if somewhat erratic, sloppy dark comedy nonetheless.Full of unexpected twists and turns. Some plot points go nowhere unfortunately. Quite a bit of focus at one point in the movie is on the fact that the previous housekeeper's face has been beaten. In fact, the question is specifically raised as to what happened and yet.... never answered. WTF?A quirky look at the class divide. I found the wrap up at the end a little long and unnecessary, and honestly found some of the final scenes discordant. Switching to a narrated jumpy set of scenes with a dream scene thrown in for good measure. It all seened very amateurish. Which is sad because the first 3 quarters were great.The individual buttons for the individual stair pendant lights? Really? A ridiculous prop to build in the morse code prop which, in itself, was trivial and silly. Also the master architect designed his escape bunker to resemble a horror set with no egress to the outside world? Very very incongruous and illogical.Oscar worthy? I definitely don't agree, but there you go.An amusing non Hollywood movie but so so when compared to its Asian peers. A great opportunity for the less educated Hollywood elite to show how politically woke they are. ðŸ™„",6,1,2,25 February 2020
Rango," DERANGO-ED IF YOU MISS THIS!
","This is a seriously excellent western. And, may I say, awfully excellent animated family adventure out of the very top drawer. Superb characters, fun dialogue and animation way ahead of its time.Don't miss it!!",10,2,2,26 June 2020
Mother!," ALLEGORICAL WASTE OF TIME
",So ridiculous! Pointless pretentious psuedo intellectual claptrap.OMFG....,1,7,9,5 December 2019
Creed II," BARELY CREEDIBLE
","So so, remake of every Rocky movie ever made. Those are a lot of movies. I was rooting for Viktor.",5,1,1,18 May 2020
Deadpool," DEAD CERT ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVES
","This is such a fantastic movie. Miller is so courageous to break the Super hero mold with the dirty minded, wise cracking anti hero, Deadpool.Fantastic, hilarious script, never flagging action and over the top violence and gore. This is seriously ground and bone breaking.One of my definite go to repeat views if I am ever depressed and need a lift.Defo reco!!!",10,1,3,4 April 2020
Green Book," I know what the fuss is about
","It gives me great pleasure to add another glowing review amongst my many disappointments.My last was for Roma, which I gave 10 stars. I only gave this 9 although immediately after I gave it A10. I guess the only slight misgiving I had was the obvious manipulation of audience, including mine, emotions. Whilst you are swept up in it, enjoy it but afterwards I felt manipulated. Very different from the subtle approach of Roma, which was as emotional but was almost an aside. This is all about getting us emotional.That said, I said it was a glowing review. What everyone else said. 😁Great script, Viggo amazing, great score (read stirring), great cinematography, etc, etc.Oscar worthy.",9,1,1,24 January 2019
