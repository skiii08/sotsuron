Deja Vu," You never get bored
","The concept is not new. We've seen many time travel related movies. But the movie feels novel. It is more like a mystery/drama movie rather than science fiction . You never get bored. 2 hrs passed so quickly. It is hard to guess the ending. Acting is topnotch from Denzel as usual. I was trying not to fall asleep in 'The Fountain' but here I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Don't try to understand too much of the science fiction part of the movie. Enjoy the rest.Val Kilmer looks chubby! It took me a couple of moments to get convinced it was him. The female lead is pretty. The electronics equipment they use in the movie is very fascinating. So is the science fiction theory it is based on. One of the highlights of the movie is Denzel wearing a special headset and driving on a busy highway, with one eye looking into the past and other looking at the traffic! Yeah, you'll understand when you see it!",9,1,2,27 November 2006
