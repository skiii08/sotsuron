Ford v Ferrari," Ready to entertain.
","Movies about a big race or an upcoming sporting event have been done a thousand times before and they all have one thing in common - that you must win against overwhelming odds.Add this one to the list as well. So what makes this one special? Nothing in particular.. But its a Damn entertaining movie. Well written, well acted, excellent characterization, well directed.This is great entertainment. Go for it.. you wont be disappointed.",9,4,9,15 November 2019
Knives Out," Those who hate Last Jedi, please read.
","I'm going to be transparent and tell you outright that I had gone to watch this film with tinted glasses. Tinted with the shade from last Jedi. I hated that movie so much that I was prepared to hate this one as well (imagine having that chip on your shoulder).Even after the movie, I kept looking for flaws to justify my shoulder chip. However, fair is fair, and at the end of the day, this is a good film. I didn't see much which can be perceived to be of political nature in this one at all. Its a who dun it with a lot of funny one liners set in a fancy estate. The cast was excellent, the writing was classy and funny and listen, you'll have fun while watching it.A movie that doesn't piss you off, with some suspense, good one liners, good cast, A fun time to spend at the cinema. What more do you expect from a movie?I put 9 and 10 star reviews for movies with exemplary technical achievements, pulling off a very difficult sequel or unique artistic value. While I cant claim those things for this movie, your fun is guaranteed. Go see it and forget about star wars for once.",8,2,6,5 December 2019
The Irishman," Classic Scorsese!
","I cant believe what I saw after looking at the man in his Seventies responsible for it. Among that famous group of 1970's directors including George Miller, Spielberg, etc, Scorsese's style has the most staying power. This fact is on display in this movie.I cant think of a bad thing about this movie. Scorsese's last movie - 'Silence' was my favorite movie that year. This one is my favorite this year. Don't worry about the running time; you wont feel it.My best movie experiences are those that feel so real that I feel i'm participating in the movie rather than being a bystander. Like Silence, this one did that to me. I felt I was there - in the screen. There's nothing about this that I don't absolutely Love.Scorsese has shown what a sharp head he still has on that aging shoulders. The Cast was great, I mean, how can you go wrong with this star power right? The camera work and the sound also contribute greatly to the immersion you get.I'm really grateful to Netflix for making this movie a reality. Think about it - with all the recent social message movies flooding Hollywood these days, do you think this movie would have been green lit given its running time and its overall theme?",10,6,13,27 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A bunch of feel good scenes not a movie make!
","I watched this movie when it came out in the theaters and had an opportunity to re-watch this in Disney +. Since I have an account now, i thought I'll leave a review so that some other poor soul might benefit and save three hours.My friends, Movies are precious. your Time is precious. If you are reading this review in 2025 or 2026, please remember that there is a century of movies for you to watch and 70 percent of them are likely to be better than this.This so called movie is just a collection of disparate scenes. There is little that connects different sets, characters and areas. Its like they're trying to tell five different plots woven into one in a bad way. Its also like they want to tell you a social message more than the actual story.The characterization is so bad, you simply cant tell which character will behave in which way. The actions of these characters are so inconsistent with their actions just a few scenes ago that you're left with a gigantic WTF on your forehead.This isn't a movie made for you, its a movie made to please one individual - The queen of Disney (you know who that is).Please dont waste your precious time on this, watch the series 'The Mandalorian' instead.",1,15,20,25 November 2019
Joker," At the rate we're going, we deserve the Joker
","This movie is just unbelievable. I saw this movie after reading through endless articles praising it. I was so hyped up for this movie that I was bothered my own hype for it would cause me to be disappointed. However, the reverse happened and I'm surprised at how much my own expectations were exceeded.Do yourselves a favor and watch it on the big screen just to give the studio a little contribution of your own. This is the kind of film that has to be encouraged. Else, all we'll get is Avengers 200 and Avatar 10.",10,2,3,11 November 2019
