Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Toon Noir
","Somewhere in Hollywood, sometime in the 40's, Jessica Rabbit bumped into Eddie Valiant. At this cultural crossroad of Howard Hawks, Bogart, Chandler, gangster movies, Warner's cartoons & Ayn Rand, Robert Zemeckis sets up his masterpiece 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. Elsewhere commentators have waxed about the technical brilliance of this movie, so I shall instead rave about the attention to details (the shadow of the Maltese Falcon in Valiant's office, the dead partner as in Spade & Archer of MF, the weasel's gangster movie patter) & the wonderful period feel (the tram cars, the bar, the studio lots). The plot itself is no great shakes - big business as the villain has been tackled successfully in many novels/ movies like Fountainhead & Big Sleep. But the sheer audacity of setting an alternate cartoon world with its own rules & morals deserves a round of applause. And the fact that he pulls it off so well is what makes this movie a classic. Add to that wonderful performances by Bob Hoskins & Christopher Lloyd, & you have a movie to watch & watch again.I saw this movie again on TV after it was first released when I was a kid, & the intervening years have given me much more to take out of this movie. See it as an adult's movie (because of Jessica Rabbit, if nothing else!) & enjoy it to the full!",Null,0,1,21 February 2000
Stalag 17," An entertainer with serious questions
","'Stalag 17' is one of the best movies I have seen. It is uproariously funny, it is immensely suspenseful & it has characters you will root for (though not necessarily William Holden - the designated hero!). At times the camarederie between the concentration camp inmates is like boys in a college hostel. One of them is the teacher's pet & feeds him with confidential information. Some lust after the girls in the hostel across the road. Another one runs illegal gambling & bootlegging operations. The story is that of the coming of age of the last named, William Holden.In between the fun & sweat, some important issues crop up. To whom is a person ultimately responsible - himself or his country. Both are causes worth fighting for & Wilder makes convincing cases for each. Class conflict in a strictly disciplined body is also tackled, as is the gay subtext in a prison camp. The last theme has been an issue in many POW movies - Great Escape, Bridge on the River Kwai, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. In the interplay of the Shapiro & Animal characters in 'S17' with the latter's Betty Grable obsession, we see enough evidences of this. The film's most magical moment to me is when the inmates of Stalag 17 sing & dance to the old confed. song Â‘Johnny Comes Marching Home Again'. It is sure to give you goosebumps!This is a great movie, & should be seen over & over again.",Null,9,14,15 November 1999
