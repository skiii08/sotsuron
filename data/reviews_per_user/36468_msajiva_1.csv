Walk the Line," Not Just Another Country Music Movie...It's The Best!!!
","Rich characters and backgrounds. Superb acting by Reese and Joaquin. Not just another Country Music Movie it's a beautiful love story.I wasn't prepared for this movie to be this good. I was amazed to find out that Joaquin and Reese performed their own songs. I can't say it enough. Both were excellent.I can watch this movie over and over. As soon as the DVD is in stores I'll be down there to grab my copy.I saw it twice in last month. Then Saturday morning I noticed a Showcase Cinema in East Windsor, CT was still showing it. I went the distance and watched the 9:40 p.m. show. Getting home around 1 a.m. Even at that hour I saw seven other couples watching it.",10,0,0,19 February 2006
