United 93," A great film to converse about
","I was skeptical about seeing this film. I was afraid that it would be overly politicized, and give one side of the political spectrum lots of ammo to run their mouths off with for the next few months. I was also afraid that it would be a pity party for the victims of 9/11, and while they deserve our regards and sympathy, it would not have been appropriate to do this with a overly emotional tear jerker. I was afraid that it would be an outrageous pro-American pride film, and while I have great pride in my country, for all its strengths and weaknesses, again, it would have been inappropriate to make a film like this.I was very pleased to have watched a film that was none of these things. It is clear that the filmmakers took great care to make this film serious and respectful. Not only respectful to the victims of 9/11, but respectful to the perpetrators, in the sense that they were not caricatured, not over-villainous, and not under-villainous. The terrorists were portrayed as terrorists. They were not monsters, they were not 'normal people caught up with the wrong crowd'. I cannot express how amazing it was to really see a film by someone who wanted to make a film for the sake of reflection and respect, not to please someones agenda.This film did not cater towards any political agenda either. Some of my friends I was with commented that is seemed to lean to the left a bit, however upon asking them more questions, this interpretation was a compilation of their past memories and opinions. The film does portray certain things that were done wrong by certain authorities, yes, including the president. Again, however, the filmmakers do not make this film about those mistakes, nor does it place blame. In the film the president is simply 'out of contact'. Rather than using this information to put a black mark on the president, it shows how this situation did not help solve the problems that were at hand at the time. I have to say that for a very delicate subject, this film walks the line of objectivity as perfectly as could possibly be done, seeking to show the viewers how to learn from this incident, rather than point fingers.Now, as a Film Studies major, I have some things to say about this film, regardless of its contextual content.The editing is excellent. In the opening scene the cuts happen exactly when they should, the rhythm is right on the money. I could literally count beats in my head and feel every cut motivating me to watch the film. Throughout the film, editing is done with precision to build suspense, and I could tell that the editor was in complete control of how quickly and how intensely the action was built up. The cinematography was good. There were moments where I thought that the shaky, close in, focus shifting, grainy style was a little bit overdone. This style certainly is consistent with themes of the film, and shows an excellent grasp of how to handle this type of film on the part of the DP, but, as I said, I would have taken only a very small portion, less than 5%, of the 'action' shots and replaced them with somewhat clearer shots, just at a few moments were I though that I would benefit more from a calm, clean shot than a kinetic shot. Other than that I though the aesthetic style of the film was excellent.The Actors and Actresses were all rather unknown to me, I recognized a couple faces but couldn't put any names. I am curious as to whether none of the big names wanted to attach themselves to a potentially controversial film, or if it was the decision of the filmmakers to avoid having the audience attribute personalities to the characters from past films. I loved the acting. Only for a few brief shots were there signs of overacting, and then only the slightest. I appreciated the way that the costuming and mannerisms of the actors were well matched to the roles they played and the kind of characters they were. The soundtrack was mostly absent. In fact, I am going to venture out and say there was no non-diagetic music until the very end, despite the fact that I know I could have very well missed it. Either way I though it was a wise choice. Music adds external emotional context to the film and by not having any music it allowed for maximum objectivity, which promoted the intellectual approach that was taken to the subject matter, which as I have said is the best thing about this film. The hectic audio mix of the control rooms and plane all aided the cinematic style, creating a unified and consistent feel for the film.All said, I gave this film a 8/10, because in the end it is simply a good film, that works hard to give an intelligent and objective (as possible) view of some events that are very meaningful to most anyone who would go see it. It demonstrates a technical proficiency on the part of the filmmakers, and shows a genuine desire to make a positive, respectful, and reflective film. I don't rate it higher only because it does not display real excellence in terms of cinematic ingenuity or execution, or explore ideologies using filmic techniques, in the sense that the bona fide film masterpieces do, but its a damn good movie.",8,11,22,28 April 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Arnold is damn funny
","This movie is awesome.  Terminator is not about man against machine, it is not about the end of the world, it IS about one liners spoken in an austrian accent by a man who could at one point bench two of you put together.  I laughed so hard I almost got kicked out of the theatre.  By the way, cameron is the wrong guy for terminator.  he is too serious and deep.The new director finally realized terminator's potential as a comedy, and exploited arnold's arnoldness to create the most lighthearted and funny terminator yet.  It is too bad that all three weren't like this.  Anyone who complains about his movie is a loser who can't lighten up and just have a good time.  This is the best arnold flick since   'Last Action Hero'.",10,0,0,4 July 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," This Film Needs To Be Put In Its Place
","This Might Have Spoilers in it, depending on what you consider spoilers, i think that any review is by definition a spoiler because it effects your viewing experience by placing bias on your thoughts pertaining to the film before you see it. Anyways. Basically, people either say: A) this movie sucks its boring, has no plot, the visuals are well composed, but look fake by modern comparison, the acting is terrible, etc.....or B) this is the greatest film of all time, it explores such amazing depths of human existence, the visuals are brilliant and unmatched, incredible, intelligent, etc......The truth is they are both right, and both wrong. The problem arises in the fact that Film does everything film can do, but does it in non film ways. This film IS boring, it has no plot, it has no 'acting'. It ISN'T supposed to! This film shouldn't be on the shelf at blockbuster, it should be at the library in the philosophy section, or hanging in the art gallery. You are all looking at this the wrong way, with closed minds. This is just a philosophical text and a painting seen through the camera, it is in no way a 'film'.You stuck up people who think they are better than everyone else because they 'get it' are all wrong to give this a 10, because a film is made up out of all the aspects, plot, acting, cinematography, meaning, technical achievement, pacing, etc..... so just because you feel the need to make yourselves feel better by claiming this is such a great film only you can appreciate it don't try to tell anyone its truly a 10/10 or the greatest film of all time. It clearly isn't, it might have a 10/10 in a few aspects, but that doesn't make up for all the 0/10 its going to get in the other components of a film.You dull people who think that a film needs explosions every 6 seconds, a classic story-telling technique, and has to have some big Hollywood star are all wrong as well. Film is an art form, and for a film to actually delve into some philosophical idea is a great thing, and deserves its respect. Just because you can't focus your attention for more then 10 seconds and are too lazy to want to put any effort into watching a movie doesn't meant that filmmakers should cater to your slothfulness and intellectual degradation.I give it a rating of 3 not because it is awful in its entirety, but these ratings are supposed to rate it as a movie, compared to all other movies in the world, and as a movie, it is awful. If this was the the 'Internet ART AND PHILOSOPHY DataBase' then i would rate it a 10/10, but it isn't, this is the 'Internet MOVIE DataBase', so, when you consider all the things that make a good FILM, 2001 doesn't match up to truly great films which not only have equally good visuals and meaning, but also have original plots (the 2001 plot is original, i suppose a better word would have been something like....engaging?), intense characters, good pacing, etc.....So, everyone needs to put away their egos and give this film a fair and just judgment. One of the best 100 FILMS of all time? not even close, A brilliant visual work of art and exploration of man, yes.One last note, some people like to add that the music is brilliant, but id like to remind you that Kubrick didn't compose it, other musical geniuses did, and trust me, it is not that hard to pick out some famous classical music and put it in a movie, so give the musical credit to where it is due, the composers, and not to Kubrick.",8,0,4,27 March 2005
