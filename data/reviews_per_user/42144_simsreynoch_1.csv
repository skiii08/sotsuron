Insidious: Chapter 2," insidious 2
","-this movie really great, but that movie can scare only the kids. this didn't make -Lots of overly loud screams that's not very scary in fact every time we see our friendly ghosts they seem to just scream at our protagonists which fills me with the desire to shout back or assault my laptop. -If you happened to like the first chapter, you will also like the second even though there are a few differences between both movies. -First of all, the second chapter kicks off with a more gripping story line and a few good scares while the first part took its time to introduce everybody. As the second movie is based on quite the same characters as the first movie -This movie's pace is definitely faster and quite gripping from the beginning to end. This movie's pace is definitely faster and quite gripping from the beginning to end. -I recommend you to want this movie.",8,0,0,26 November 2015
