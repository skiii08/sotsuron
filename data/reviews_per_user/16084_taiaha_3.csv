The Blair Witch Project," Not so bad, not so good
","Ho hum.  This movie seems to polarise most viewers into over the top eulogies, or under the bottom castigation.  For me, it really did average out to average (plus).  There have been any number of documentaries showing people caught out of their usual environment becoming stressed out to the nth degree, and the cast acted out this in fairly convincing form...  The last half hour or so builds the tension nicely, and the ending was, well... predictable but provocative.  The cinematography was excellent and unique for a feature movie, but I guess it will only work once.Our 8 year old daughter insisted on watching with us, having assured us she knew all the cuss words ever in the whole world. We believed her and she suffered no sleepless nights and was more intrigued about what really happened at the end.  We have a plausible theory, and it hasn't got anything to do with witches....  heeheehee",Null,0,0,1 December 1999

","... from all the tea breaks I had to take. This movie failed to hold my attention at all. OK, maybe for a few 30 second intervals. Yes, the CGI is good, but so are a lot of other movies. The sound is good, but so are a lot of other movies. None of the actors seemed to have to make much effort, probably because the script and plot were pretty much irrelevant.",2,6,10,12 March 2017
U-571," Excellent suspense drama, but...
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie - great action, suspense, effects (especially the sound).  Overall the cast did a good job conveying their fear & frustration.  So why the but...?The film score was overpowering and intrusive at times - the drip, drip of water and creaking of rivets would have been far more atmospheric by themselves...Much has already been made of the 'Hollywood History' aspect of this movie. Suffice to say that it is NOT a documentary, however there were a few suspensions of belief necessary...The ending was terribly lame, an a US Navy PBY in the Western Approaches in 1941, or any year??  I don't think so...Overall though, well worth seeing, and on the big screen only",Null,0,1,11 May 2000
