Ford v Ferrari," Ford vs Ferrari is a gem of movie.
","I really, really liked 'Ford v Ferrari.' I'm not a car nor racing enthusiast, but my god does the movie make me want to be one. There's a lot of precision and heart put into this, and Christian Bale nails the role of Ken Miles as perfect as a smooth drift. Yes, it's a long one, but the runtime complements its storytelling.It has the best car sequences I've ever seen in any movie, and one that employs a mixture of stress and exhilaration. The cinematography is used as a tool and not just an aesthetic what with its well-calculated sequences especially during the race scenes.'Ford v Ferrari' also features the best sound design and score that I've heard in a long time since 'The Social Network.' Every minute is carefully paired along with its corresponding music, making it look and feel a little more expressive and resonant.It's such an awesome experience sitting through 'Ford v Ferrari,' something I'd like to relive again and again.I'm not a car guy, i don't understand the engineering of race cars, or anything like that, but this movie might change that. Loved it....",9,1,2,30 December 2019
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Watch & Listen
","Loved everything!! The characters, the story, the cinematography and dance numbers!! The costume design is gorgeous and I believed every character. You really don't want the film to end, that's how enjoyable it is to watch these characters together.",9,0,0,26 March 2020
Changeling," 'Yours is a story with a happy ending, Ms. Collins. People love happy endings.'
","I liked it slightly less on this rewatch. Not because it's long or because there's too much/not much going on. It's because there are certain moments where the film is catering to the audience, making the viewers feel outraged when the main character is wronged or content when something goes the way it should. Not that it's a big issue but this subjective approach becomes a little too intruding at times. Maybe the script is too self-indulgent or maybe that's just Eastwood being Eastwood and over-directing. Talking about Eastwood being Eastwood, his score for this movie is quite galling, that same piano piece playing throughout the movie to the point of suffocation.Nevertheless, Changeling is a magnificently crafted film, with pristine cinematography and marvelous production design, giving palpable life to a world set in Los Angeles in the first half of the twentieth century. The acting is good across the board, with stand outs Angelina Jolie as a mother fighting to find her missing child and Michael Kelly as a detective who works on the case. Based on true events, the story is interesting and intense, touching on many aspects of the life back in the day in LA, like gender inequality, political abuse and police corruption. Great movie.43 likes",8,1,3,28 March 2020
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Just Like.... Amazing.. That's All..
","Ah yes this movie about privileged rich kids dealing with their meaningless shallow problems like the lingering trauma of childhhood sexual abuse, dealing with grief over your best friend's suicide, being openly gay and receiving brutal homophobia and dismissal from the man you love, being cheated on and abandoned in relationships and dealing with depression and crippling social anxieties by making connections and bonding with people, to find some form of solace and beauty in a world filled with such deep pain. this movie was the first time i ever saw someone that felt like me, and it's still one of the only ones. this movie has helped me through initial doubts over my diagnosis, over depressive periods throughout my entire life, through my intense self hatred and physically violent lapses. it has existed with me and grown with me and now as i approach the end of my adolescent self, i look back and imagine charlie and dream for him a world where his traumas healed and everything became okay. makes me believe that mine will too.",9,0,0,27 December 2019
Gravity," So Great?
","Yes. Yet another five star rating for Gravity. Before I go on, the five stars are for the experience. I don't know how you rate films, but my rating is for a great deal based on the fact that I just walked out of the theatre having seen something I have never seen before. Gravity is Jurassic Park's dinosaurs. It is a technological marvel urged on by a director who is intent on discovering how far he can stretch the medium. Many have said it and I have to agree. This was made for IMAX and probably shouldn't be seen any other way.What makes Gravity so great? It is the totality of the immersive experience, the relentless ruthlessness of the script towards its characters and the fact that the pacing is immaculate.The way Cuaron shoots his film, with his familiar fluid camerawork, creates the tether to the main characters. It's up close and personal. After the absolutely stunning opening sequence is over, we never really leave Bullock and co. We hover with them, sometimes even allowing access to their suit and experience everything through their eyes. This narrow focus is utilized optimally to create the unbelievable tension. Cuaron's choreography of the action is amazing in these scenes. Never losing sight of what is going on and genuinely taking you by surprise at points. In what is essentially a disaster thriller, immersion like this is a prerequisite for a connection with the audience. And boy did it connect with me. There were scenes that had me gasping for air, scenes that made me feel claustrophobic and scenes that had me shifting in my seat, urging our heroine on. The coldness of space is apparently one of the scariest movie villains imaginable.The fact that the very lean plot keeps bombarding the characters with problem after problem means that there are very few moments to come up for air. These days films apparently have to run for at least 2 hours, especially the bigger films. Gravity takes 90 minutes, the perfect length for a movie. It is stripped of practically everything, we get the smallest of backstories about the characters and the plot goes from A to B like it should, leaving behind only the intent of the film. To grab you by your throat and take you on a ride you'll never forget. All in the guise of an extremely realistic thriller set in space.Cuaron does seem to want to give us some pinpricks of an underlying theme running through Bullock's character arc. Cuaron literally allows her to be reborn. There is, what is perhaps the most beautiful scene of the film, a shot where she floats like an embryo. The crying of a baby, Buddha smiling down on her and of course the final scene, all show a rebirth of Bullock's character. Some might feel this change to be a bit heavy handed, I absolutely loved it. It works, mainly because of a very understated performance by Bullock. I normally don't care much for her, but she was excellent here, especially in the quieter, more intimate moments.Gravity manages to appeal to a primal fear. The fear of the absolute nothingness. The coldness of the grave, here in the shape of the final frontier. It is a constant threat, a constant presence. And the main reasons for it working the way it does are the dedication to realism and the sublime cinematography. The latter is where the main innovation seems to lie. The line between what is actually shot and what is digitally created is completely blurred here. Everything jumps off the screen with resounding beauty and clarity. It is awe inspiringly gorgeous. I am fully aware I am gushing out a ludicrous amount of praise now, but the beauty of what they have created here left me gaping at the screen and that just doesn't happen often.Gravity is a small step for a film, but a giant leap for cinema.",9,2,3,17 November 2019
Citizen Kane," This is Cinema
","The fact that this film continues to inspire and demonstrate the craftsmanship that can go into film is extraordinary. Orson Wells delivers a tale of an epic individual who lives a life of many regrets. Through revolutionary techniques from extremely well thought out shots, incredible detail in scenery, and the use of light, are but a couple of examples of how Wells is able to orchestrate this masterpiece. The score is incredibly powerful and the overall morales the story teaches to this day have been cherished from generation to generation. Citizen Kane is without a doubt, a masterpiece in itself.",9,1,2,23 March 2020
The Rookie," John Lee Hancock.. again..
","Disney does like a good old fashioned sports story with a human interest angle. I'm a huge fan of Baseball and Baseball films in general, so even though this is Disney and likely to be a sugar-sweet family friendly film devoid of any real conflict and turmoil , I decided to give this one a punt.
I'd be a liar if I said I had even heard of Jim Morris, the unlikely hero of this true story about a Baseball pitcher who makes his Major League debut at the age of 35. It's the stuff of dreams, and with Dennis Quaid giving a decent account of himself as the humble but tenacious High School teacher who follows his dream after a pact with his pupils, this is actually quite inspiring. Quaid looks the part too. Yes I'm sure there were some special effects used, certainly in the sound department, but he threw well and was fairly convincing. His debut at Arlington against the Texas Rangers did make my heart flutter a little, but hey, this is Disney. Aside from Quaid and Rachel Griffiths who played his wife, there's only a small cameo from Brian Cox of any note in an otherwise cast of nobodies.
Jim Morris apparently had two years as a reliever with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays although according to his stats he never really altered the outcome of any of his games with a record of 0-0. In a day when sportsmen are getting older and carrying on for longer, maybe Morris's story won't be a one-off much longer and that day when I stride out at Fenway to pitch against the Yankees becomes a reality.",6,0,0,12 March 2020
Knives Out," wait for the Benoit Blanc cinematic universe.
","The rollercoaster that this film is keeps my eyes opened from start to finish. The combination of wit, sarcasm, and playful allegories in this comes in just the right amount, sufficient but not enough to overshadow the thrilling whodunnit the film is supposed to be. I had a great time laughing at Daniel Craig's accent and even better at the rich white liberals proving that they only uphold liberalism ideas when it fits their agenda and their self-entitlement. Not to mention Toni Collette's character is everything and you can't imagine how refreshing it is to see ChrisEdit: Evans acting so unlike Steve Rogers. Delightful treat.
Modern American Gothic Tale. Loved every twist and turn and really connected to it. On a personal level. Being cooked and then having a couple share the first names of your own grandparents is trippy af, especially when what they're saying actually describes your family. Everything great about Clue updates to this century. Vaping was not needed.",9,1,5,30 January 2020
The Irishman," another Italian-American movie... really..?
","This movie is a eulogy to the fake Italian-American accent gangster movies reproduced by Martin Scorsese. The acting was good, the story was good but I felt the story was over flooding with content to cover. The story was trying to make a screen adaptation of 'I Heard You Paint Houses' about Jimmy Hoffa's rise and fall and his people that were there for his rise but not his fall, and then there was the original thought provoking story of Scorsese's gangsters getting a reality check. It was hard to keep watching after two hours, but I'm glad I kept watching. The digital makeup to make the actors look younger was uncomfortable to watch because I knew there was old men under there, but I think that was the point. Scorsese loves to make his watchers uncomfortable, and I appreciate it. Movies should challenge our emotions and thoughts just like a painting or book.This movie is great for anyone who loves the long dialogue, suspenseful, violent, Italian-American gangster Scorsese films. But if you aren't a fan of that kind of movie, I wouldn't recommend you commit to watching it.",6,3,4,15 December 2019
Dear John," Sparks
","One of the bests film of Sparks filmography
The end is quite different to the other films, and that's why I enjoyed it.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Sam Rockwell
","Dixon was trying to do better in the end, but maybe we can't be redeemed, not really, and we must bear the burden of the things we've done. The same is true of Mildred. She isn't redeemed in the end either, and her efforts didn't produce any results. Some probably think that 'the narrative is unsatisfying.' I think it is, but it's meant to be. We don't always get the answers we are looking for, only that we must endure and try to be better.Really good cinematography and visual direction. Everything feels cohesive.",9,1,1,26 March 2020
American Sniper," Cooper is amazing but..

North by Northwest," 35mm..
","North by Northwest is famous because of one scene. Now, that doesn't mean the rest of it is lacking, as it should be common knowledge of its solidified place in the canon of the greatest American films in the history of the cinema, but the zenith is found in a classic Hitchcock concept: the image of the pursuer and the pursued. Its famous sequence of a crop-duster aircraft leaping towards Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill in the Midwest countryside - bullets flying near his dives for survival - is constructed through the context of a world unknown: a place not designed for your color or creed or gender or social status. It is an environment, depicted via the absurd logic of a home becoming a prison, which is entirely turned against you. It is what many people feel like when they wake up in the morning. Thornhill's anxiety of normal, simple structures and people, such as the bus and the man waiting for it, defines a clash between uncomfortable normalcy of culture and those who oppose the system because they don't know how else to live. In Hitchcock's universe, an airplane with assassins at the controls is an obvious occurrence, but for Thornhill, it is a symbol of confinement and hostile order taking hold of even the most inhuman machine and making it ruthless. What else to do but run?",9,0,0,22 March 2020
Underground," 'Podzemlje'
","Probably the best film no one hears about, Underground is so full of life yet soaked in death.The director, Emir Kusturica has somehow turned the real world into a Fellini party, a Lubitsch romance with Alex Cox punk poetry mixed with Powell and Pressburger cinematic weight.At 2 hours and 45 minutes Underground only ever rests when the chapter cards appear on screen. Starting with a mentally challenged innocent young man at a zoo trying to protect a chimp amidst a bombing raid. Two best friends who are firmly against Hitler's Nazis end up falling for the same woman, slowly pulled apart by deceit, war and lies. Ghosts are seen swimming in the lakes and underground basins. The characters live through three monumental wars, a huge film production and the murder of all their friends. Through all of this the movie is an absolute blast of energy and comedy. Effortlessly balancing all of the characters and all of the metaphor, Underground may be specifically about that part of the world but says so much more than just that part of the world.The first hour is like watching the Farrelly brothers go to war. It's so funny, so gag filled that you can't believe the movie will be able to hit you with the emotion that it does at the end. Using incredible imagery and symbolism, that last 30 minutes is jaw dropping. You have a father and son entering into a surreal 'real world' with no understanding of what's happening, friends burning alive in front of a church, a final image of the after life as all of the characters break away, literally, from the earth they stand on and float out to sea.Merging fiction and fact in such an original way, even if it does use the same process that Forest Gump does, intercutting the film's characters into stock footage. The never ending film shoot that is based on the character's real life struggle smashes up with the actual characters it's portraying. What does this all mean? Fiction can be just as real and emotional as real life. Art can find a way to burrow inside of reality and provide better context. It's also a slight meta dig at the film industry, as the tyrannical director keeps screaming for more reality until someone actually dies. Even then the director is not satisfied with his actors.This movie is such an experience. I have no connection to this Eastern European world. I was not alive during WWII, the cold war or the Serbian war. But the film can still illuminate other aspects of our lives even if the audience is removed from the scenarios it's showing us. What an achievement.",9,0,0,20 March 2020
Legends of the Fall," NOW THIS WAS A RIDE
","Legends of the Fall is an epic western drama filled with raw emotions and shocking twists. Edward Zwick directs with a fine sense of realism and massive scope in vision. The battles and fights are as exciting as the tender romance moments. The score from James Horner is lovely, sweeping across the shots of fields and wilderness, cradling each scene carefully. It's one of Brad Pitt's best performances, if not his best. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic and over the top in a very good way. Julia Ormond, Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas all pick up the slack in their scenes as well.",9,0,1,23 February 2020
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Pitt's best performance...
","The villain dies a villain's death, the coward, however, goes out alone. These golden wheat fields that never fail to make me somewhat religious reminds me of Malick's Days of Heaven, upped to a whole new level with the addition of Roger Deakins, being a ~ godsend ~ as always, stops at nothing to craft heart-stopping sequences like the opening train robbery. (Train emerging from darkness, light illuminating masked figures in the woods, Deakin's spell casted on every frame.) Brad Pitt is as menacing as Daniel Plainview, his presence is a continuous jump scare, adjusts his mask like a true fashion model, every close up of him is an ad for Prada or some other capitalist thing, I swear, even the wind dares not blow his direction. Just brilliant filmmaking, acting, storytelling.",9,0,0,23 February 2020
Remember the Titans," 'Tha Titans ah here y'all! We ain't goin no where!'

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," this was edited like a family guy episode
","Has anyone ever noticed that Brad Pitt is a very handsome man?Quentin Tarantino finally made a film about 'real people,' in every sense of the phrase. i liked it a lot as a wounded portrait of middle-age reflected against the end of the movies' *golden* age (Leo/Pitt are obviously terrific, though it's painful how little screen time they get together).but the film is scattered to the point of abstraction, thin scenes are stretched to their breaking points, and the dialogue is leaden in a way that Tarantino's has never been before. this is a lot more interesting than the whiz-bang take on this material QT could make in his sleep (the kind of take suggested by the opening 10 minutes), but the film's confrontation with / self-examination of irrelevance seldom feels served by how leaden this thing is in a moment-to-moment basis. the 5-minute scene where Sharon Tate walks down the street, buys a book, and then walks back up the street... it's like anti-entertainment in a way that creates a strange friction with Tarantino's natural impulse. and those last 20 minutes... we'll talk about those later.but the good scenes are great scenes, and the 'rick king dalton' bit from the trailer plays 10x better in context. also dug how so much of the movie is like Grand Theft Auto Tinseltown, with characters driving around old-timey LA as their car radios bark period-appropriate commercials and jingles at them. maybe this will all play better a second time around, when i'm not expecting something a little more amped up and keyed in - i can see this going up in my estimation, and not the other way. but do yourself a favor and downshift your expectations to a quiet two-hander about being a has-been.",5,1,2,21 December 2019
Aladdin," cringey.
","I was honestly shocked when my friend told me this was a Guy Richie film. Definitely not a great film but the two new leads carried what would have otherwise been a pretty unwatchable filmEdit 2020;
As a remake, this film falls flat. As a movie on its own however, it really falls flat. The story of Aladdin, however you tell it, is supposed to be an enchanted and magical time, or as Aladdin himself would put it, a whole new world. It shouldn't be distracting you with its inconveniences, but instead immersing you in a brand new fantasy.
The film, if you've seen the original Aladdin, is pretty much the same only with a lot more ugliness. Aladdin is a street rat and thief living in the Arabian city of Agrabah. One day however, he comes across a princess named Jasmine who is dressed as a commoner. In an attempt to take advantage of Aladdin's affections for her, the royal vizier Jafar manipulates Aladdin into going into a magic cave filled with treasures and a lamp he must retrieve for Jafar and in return, Jafar will give Aladdin the happy ending he so desperately wishes for with the princess. He betrays Aladdin however, leaving him stuck in the cave with the lamp, which he soon discovers holds a magical genie, played by Will Smith. Aladdin uses the Genie to become a prince so he can woo the princess and hopefully win her over.
Now the first problem is the subplots. Not only does this film carry over subplots from the first film, but it also invents completely new and pointless ones to go along with them. For instance, the Genie has a crush with Jasmine's handmaiden. Now you might be asking yourself, 'Why?' I mean, not only is it weird to see the Genie attracted to human women, but it also adds nothing to the story in any way at all!
Then we have the special effects. They look awful. The Genie, as I'm sure the people who've already watched this film have already pieced together, looks hideous. Like, REALLY hideous. He is so obviously a CGI character, and he moves just like one too. The idea of CGI is to make something that is obviously fake move and look like a real thing, not make it move and look more fake!
Then we have the song numbers. First off, the new song numbers are bland. Jasmine gets a new song called Speechless, which not only is sung during the worst possible time in the movie, but also has the most forgettable melody and lyrics. Then, the old songs are given some 'updates.' I put quotes around updates because they are extremely downgraded. They are surprisingly sung terribly, especially by Will Smith, but songs like Prince Ali have the most boring choreography put on film. They somehow managed to screw up Prince Ali, which should be an epic song and dance number in its sleep!
Overall, Aladdin is an awful movie. Like a really awful movie. I'm glad I'm done with it and I never have to watch it ever again. If you never watched the original Aladdin film, you might see this as terrible, but if you have seen the original, you will probably for sure see this as cringey.",2,2,2,14 February 2020

Gran Torino," It's Eastwood's requiem, and it's fantastic.
","Clint Eastwood in this film reminds me of my grandpa Hasan, though not entirely, some of the decisions made are precisely decisions I could see my grandpa making if he were alone and surrounded by a neighbor changing from what he knew it to me as he grows older. I had a connection with Walt (Clint Eastwood) for that very reason. From a character development standpoint it was perfect, he started out a grade  to everyone and everything, souly based on his past experiences. By the end of the film, he grew to care for this neighborhood kid and made it his dying goal to keep this kid from living the rest of his life in regret and misery.

The Longest Day," Masterpiece
","The thing that's always worried me about being one of the few is the way we keep on getting fewer.
-Flight Officer David CampbellAn epic war film if there ever was one. The film plays like a chess match as we see D-Day from the perspective of the Germans, English, Americans and French (both Army and resistance) with different directors doing their own segments. The biggest surprise is that at no time does the film feel like different directors were involved.I thought the glorified cameos would be a bit much in the film, but it turns out it works a great deal in it's favor. You get an instant attachment to certain characters and care what happens with limited time devoted to them which is good, because despite it being three hours long, the film doesn't have time to waste on character development.It works though. How do we make sure the audience notices Brig. Gen. Norman Cota when he's introduced in a five minute scene and then remember him when he shows up again 2 hours later? Put Robert Mitchum in the role. How do we make sure the audience is suddenly invested in what happens to Pvt. Flanagan when we see him for the first time storming the beaches of Normandy? Cast Sean Connery in the role. Ect and so forth.The various moving parts coming together with amazing star power to back it up would be enough to make this a great movie, but it also has some jaw dropping amazing shots. Practical shots you do not see in films today without them being CGI'd to hell.Also one of the most surprising elements of the film is that despite it being this grand epic, completely worthy of that moniker, the film makers decided to go with a small understated ending... which was PERFECT.

Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Love You Stephen Trask
","I've seen this movie dozens of times, and I always love it a little bit more each time I watch it. I probably saw it for the first time when I was thirteen or fourteen. Looking back on it now, I can see how, as a young person, this radical piece of media, a mixture of performance, theatre, film, and monologue had a profound impact on my understanding and ideas of sexuality, identity, gender, gender as performance, and the intersection of all these things. And for that, it will always be a part of me.But the film also seems to grow older as I do. Each time I watch it, I catch some new layer, some previously unspoken nuance, that strikes me like lightning. Be it the musical in-jokes, the off-color political commentary, or the shaky way Hedwig ages throughout the film. I will never grow tired of this film, this character, this story, this life.All that being said, this was the first time I watched this movie with my parents. And they loved it as well. And for their love of it, their wide-ranging understanding of how meaningful and influential it has been to me, I saw all the things they have meant, and all the ways they have influenced me, always for the better.

","All this formal rigor in service of what exactly? This 140-minute shrug doesn't remotely support its ambitions of describing self-actualization and peace in the face of grief and trauma and toxic relationships, much less its excessive length, and the ritual at its heart is so self-consciously ambiguous that it could just as easily been an innocuous tradition and still have the same emotional and figurative resonance aside from an overarticulated thread about the men in her life being competitive and/or gaslighting dipshits. At least it's almost constantly intentionally hilarious, and Florence Pugh is terrific.",3,0,1,4 December 2019

It is easy to be cynical about the Hollywood machine, and even the film itself gently satirises the system that made it, yet every now and again that soulless production line churns out a perfectly formed piece of screen magic where every element is in perfect unity. In 1952 such an event occurred and Singin' in the Rain has been enthralling generations of people ever since.It is pure undiluted cinema at its finest.",9,0,0,23 March 2020
The Last Samurai," Bushido
","Edward Zwick is one of the most under-rated directors out there, but I don't feel this is entirely representative of his best work. Not to say it isn't a damn good film (it is), but it's plainly obvious that Hollywood had their hands on this.The tone is inconsistent. One minute, there's a standard, generic Hollywood action scene, shot the same way all standard, generic Hollywood action scenes are shot. The next minute, however, is a very calm, still, introspective montage taken straight from Terrence Malick's playbook. If the movie was either a drama or an action film instead of trying to be both, I think it would have more of an identity. The pandering to the lowest-common-denominator viewer played a large role in preventing that from happening. Some moments feel overly simplified to the point where it almost becomes a detriment to the integrity of the subject matter. Zwick's touch was not entirely obscured; there are plenty of great shots, scenes, and moments that can only be the product of a film-maker of his caliber.The story is not without flaw. The entire set-up is very plain and not all that interesting. The hero lacks motivation, purpose for his goal, has nothing at stake, etc. But once Katsumoto enters the picture, the movie takes a major turn for the better. Even though the hero is not doing much externally for a preponderance of the film, it still captivates due to the strength of his inner journey. Seeing Algren learn about the samurai culture and grow to understand and respect them is without question the movie's biggest strength. His gradual character arc is splendid to behold.Cruise, however, was not a good choice for the role. He did the best job he could (a very good job, in truth), but he still felt entirely anachronistic; he didn't look, sound, or feel like a man from that era whatsoever.A few lax passages early on and several others sprinkled around the second half certainly hold the film back from reaching its full potential. There is a truly great movie in there just waiting to get out. If only Hollywood would just let film-makers make films.Despite their efforts and the flaws contained within, Zwick managed to come away with a quality product that is both meaningful and enjoyable. With more dedication to the film itself and less concern on how many people will go to the theater and spend money, this could have been a masterpiece on par with Glory.PS: the musical score is absolutely fantastic.",10,1,14,27 December 2019
The King," Kingdom of Chalamet
","Watched it for Chalamet, stayed for Edgerton and Pattinson particularly the latter...I have been excited to see this ever since it was announced that Timothée Chalamet was going to be playing King Henry V, who as always is a triumph up on screen - he's the male Jennifer Lawrence, who keeps picking the meaty roles and will eventually land his Oscar (and rightly so) however it wont be for this role!Chalamet plays a character that soo many others have played over the year, yet he brings a subtlety and captivating performance - that at times i don't see anyone else on the screen.I am the furthest from a Robert Pattinson fan but somehow he had me eating out the palm of his hand as The Dauphin - campy, over the top and at times creepy.
Yet his death scene was very lacklustre and i felt all this built up through the film was for nothing!Sean Harris as always excels playing Chief Justice William Gascoigne - theres a scene near the end that had me soo gripped just by how he completely embraced this character and went toe to toe with Chalamet.Joel Edgerton as Falstaff brings a much needed breath of fresh air into The King and for me is one of the biggest stand outs from the beginning.The battle scenes are directed brilliantly and gets you right in to the action - which at times is quite brutal but the cinematography adds a new dynamic that feels more rich and exuberant.The end battle in particular did give me Game of Thrones vibes which i also quite liked.Overall there are alot of peaks in The King which kept me gripped, however there are other movies in this genre i have watched over the years that i feel are better developed.",7,2,8,2 November 2019

Les Misérables," some scattered thoughts i had upon my 7000th rewatch
","Some scattered thoughts i had upon my 7000th rewatch-it's straight up a comedy every time javert is onscreen. i laugh every time he pops up in that silly blue outfit. like, jean valjean was in jail for 19 YEARS for STEALING A LOAF OF BREAD & fantine SOLD HER TEETH & HAIR & BODY to pay for her child's care & you're STILL gonna be a dick to them & think you're being a good christian??? ðŸ‘€<ul><li>Hugh Jackman &amp; Anne Hathaway give absolutely haunting, heartbreaking performances during Valjean's Soliloquy &amp; I Dreamed a Dream respectively. they never would've been able to pull off that level of depth if the songs had been pre-recorded rather than sung on the spot. there was a good amount of critique about the quality of the singing, but i would gladly sacrifice perfect notes for genuine emotion. that being said, there were some strange tonal issues. you can easily tell which are the broadway stars &amp; which are the film actors based on the way they perform (bways focused on singing, filmies focused on acting) and it was a bit distracting.</li></ul>-sacha baron cohen is hot as hell & master of the house is a BOP!!!!!-i don't get why people swoon over marius when enjolras is RIGHT THERE<ul><li>'to love another person is to see the face of god' will always make me cry even though i'm uhh Not Religious. this christian propaganda really works!</li></ul><ul><li>everyone except javert (LOL) dies exactly how they want to die. jean valjean = surrounded by his family. fantine = with her daughter (albeit a hallucinated one). eponine = in the arms of marius. gavroche + enjolras + all the students = in a blaze of glory, fighting for what is right. also i love how they all go to heaven except for javert. *sips tea* it's what he deserves</li></ul><ul><li>finally, i can't tell if this is even a good movie but please know that i would dramatically jump off a bridge into shallow water &amp; break my neck for it</li></ul>",8,4,5,26 December 2019
Joker," Half a star away from being perfection
","I will admit I was completely against a origin story about the greatest villain of all time.
'Why, when the mystery of who he really is makes him that much more'.A film is hangs on its writers.
If you don't have a solid script then you don't have anything even with billions behind it
eg: Justice League.
That said, not a scene nor piece of dialog wasted which is rare.
Even a person not knowing anything about Batman could watch this film and just enjoy it for what it is.
A great film",9,0,2,2 November 2019
Ray," Ray
","As a huge fan of Ray Charles' music from a young age, a biopic of one of the greatest musical icons of the 20th century was an enticing prospect. Ray is the product of fifteen years of effort from director Taylor Hackford to bring the blind singer's life story to the big screen, facing down rejection from studios wary of biopics and even more so, as Hackford himself said, 'black biopics'. The money was eventually found & Hackford realised his vision, signed off on by Charles himself after reading the script in braille & indeed approving personally of Jamie Foxx in the lead role following a jamming session whereby he forced Foxx to keep up with him free forming to Thelonious Monk! Ray therefore is visibly a passion project, filled with smoky Deep South locales, gorgeous music & a truly fantastic lead performance... but it's a fractured, baggy piece of work as a whole, despite being enjoyable with flashes of greatness.A major difficulty is how hard it becomes to warm to Charles himself, because he's not the greatest of men - a serial womaniser, even after marrying & having children, not to mention twenty years addicted to heroin he unashamedly continued taking; Foxx plays him often quite cold & brittle behind the outward charm, which radiates the most in quiet moments with Kerry Washington's put upon wife Della & when he's at the piano, belting out his fusion of gospel, blues & country that thrills the burgeoning counter-culture generation of the 50's & 60's while offending righteous church goers who consider his lyrics pure blasphemy. Hackford is honest to his subject but kind, flashbacks to his impoverished youth giving Ray the tragedy of a younger brother who drowned before glaucoma took his sight, after which he lost a mother he's partly driven so deeply to succeed for as penance for his own guilt at not doing enough to save him. Foxx too is a pure revelation, and thoroughly deserved his Academy Award as Ray - he becomes immersed in the role, nailing all of the singer's physical ticks, verbal mannerisms & intonations, and crucially the effects of the heroin addiction on his persona; it's a bravura performance, likely to stand amongst the finest in Foxx's career.The ultimate problem with Ray, one Taylor Hackford can't reconcile, is a problem frequent biopics run into - it falls into losing emotional resonance a little as it strives to tick off stages in Charles' path to stardom & later racial acceptance, feeling bloated & episodic at times in the bargain--though it does pick up in the last hour--nor indeed does the script equal Jamie Foxx's performance in particular, falling too often into melodrama. It's worth watching for his turn, of course, and the master recordings of Charles' wonderful music the director employs - it's just such a shame Ray Charles himself died before he could see a finished cut, only hearing an early rough cut in which he remarked 'That's it. That's the truth. I'm happy'. We can at least be grateful for that, especially that he could live with a life story exposing a deeply flawed man who had an extraordinary talent.",5,1,2,22 March 2020
Parasite," Jo : New man in the town
","There is a house on a hill, and there are people in it. And they're nice, but not really. There is a garden, and there they get a lot of sunlight. And it is nice, and they get to sleep there sometimes.There is a house underground, and there are people in it. And they're the first to tell you that they're not very nice: they're con-men, grifters, forgers and imposters. They sit among stink bugs, and they've been there for so long that maybe they've convinced themselves that they just belong there.There is a rock, and it is a gift, but it is also a burden. And maybe it's a metaphor, but it's also just a rock: solid and heavy, difficult to lug around, and dangerous in the wrong hands. Some people will tell you that it's supposed to bring wealth. But again, it's also just a rock.There is a line, and it cannot be crossed.There is a smell, and it comes from the underground. And the people who live in the house on the hill can smell it. And the people who live underground try to imagine a life in the sun, a future where they aren't just garbage to be washed away in the rain. But there is a smell that sticks to them, and they know that they can never really belong.There is a world, and it is nice, but not really. There are houses on hills, and houses underground. There is plenty of sun, but it isn't for everybody. There are people grateful to be slaves, and people unhappy to be served. There are systems that we are born into, and they create these lines that cannot be crossed. And we all dream of something better, but we've been living with these lines for so long that we've convinced ourselves that there really isn't anything to be done.There is a knife. And it doesn't do much in the long run, but there will always be some satisfaction in crossing some lines.",8,2,7,3 December 2019

Marriage Story," Alan Alda
","I love Alan Alda so much.Very hard to watch this movie without immediately recognizing it as Noah Baumbach's attempt to reconcile his own divorce in the most self-aggrandizing way, but I will forgive it on the sole condition that Laura Dern either runs me over with her car or allows me to treat her to a lovely expensive dinner and then never calls me again.

1408," maybe... 1408 is one of Stephen King's best adaptation
",I loved the premise of a skeptic staying at supposed haunted hotels and debunking them in his books!Psychological trauma dispensed by top notch actors like John Cusack whom basically was a one man show and a brief appearance by Samuel L. Jackson that was equally as powerful!John Cusack left me gasping for air when Stephen King opted to prey on some of his audience's fear of heights! Cusack took us on an devastatingly frantic rollercoaster ride that touched on sensitive nerves that left me clinging to the ceiling like Sylvester the cat from looney tunes fame!I preferred the ending in the Theatrical version over the Director's Cut!,8,0,0,11 March 2020
The Woman in Black," Smells like 70s
","A terrifyingly effective Gothic chiller, The Woman In Black stands tall as one of the great creepy rides of the past few years or so. Equipped with an incredible of atmosphere, place, composition, and class, the film tells a story that would fit right into anything that came out of Hammer in the 1960s.Deeply involving, loaded with jump scares, frighteningly fun, and oddly melancholic, The Woman In Black is an underrated horror film that will probably always remain one of my favorites from the genre.It really isn't anything special, but if you can get on its wavelength, then you're in for one helluva ride.",8,0,1,5 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Taika from Marvel CU.
","From the opening scene, this film had me excited. Its so much fun all the way through. Even some extremely intense scenes can also be filled with some excellent humour. Taika sure knows how to direct!
Our main cast is filled with excellent performances! (Sorry the app has glitched and the rest of this review is gonna have to be in bold...)
Earlier on there where a few scenes with the kids where i felt the performances were weak, but boy did it only get better!
The movie is also so well paced, with a plot which never seems to never slow down and never needs to. (I did feel the final sequence was a little drawn out, maybe a minute or so couldve been shaved off)
We also have excellent production design the whole way through the film... its full of colour and so visualy appealing!What a great film!",8,1,3,30 January 2020
Aladdin," 'Let's make some magic!' with Robin Williams
","The amazing voice work and comedy of Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried ... does it get any better than that? All the songs are amazing but the magic the Genie brings to 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali' are what make them really special. I remember how Disney at the time was showing off how they used a combination of hand drawn animation and CGI together for the first time, to bring the cave of wonders sequence to life and it still holds up.I was the perfect age for the start of the Disney renissance, and while the 'Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and The Beast' felt like girly movies at the time, Aladdin was a film that had the action, adventure, and comedy that truly captured my imagination as a kid.Aladdin and Jasmine are great, but the side characters are what really make it shine with all the spunk that Abu, Carpet, Genie, and Iago bring to the mix. And Jafar makes for a really sinister villian that reminds me of Rasputin from Russian History.'Come on down stop on by. Hop a carpet and fly. To another Arabian night.'",9,0,0,14 February 2020
Inside Llewyn Davis," Coen's..Still Coensss
","Glossing over the Coen's filmography confirms my immediate sentiment after finishing Inside Llewyn Davis. I have never been moved by one of their films. That is not what they do. They craft tales that shy the beaten path, fill them with semi-human characters and embrace the style they are working in wholeheartedly.Inside Llewyn Davis has all the hallmarks of a Coen film. With one trump up its sleeve causing me to allow this film to grip me, shake me and leave me the same way it leaves its protagonist. With a wry smile and an empty heart. That trump is Llewyn Davis and his portayer, Oscar Isaac, who gives one of the best performances of that year.With the characteristic, meticulous attention to detail the Coens immerse us in 60's New York and focus on the folk scene. It is an easy world to step into as it is presented to us with so much conviction and beauty. This is perhaps one of the Coens' best looking films, shot with a deep colour palette, emulating the coldness of the season and the predicament of their protagonist to perfection.Story wise it is a pretty straightforward affair. We follow a struggling musician in his quest for finding a his purpose in life. Nothing groundbreaking there. But as so often is the case it is the storyteller that makes the story and the Coens are masters at doing just that. Davis is one of their best anti-heroes. He is distant, a freeloader, egotistic and a brilliant musician. He couch surfs his way through the city, bumming cigarettes whenever he gets the chance and always trying to peddle his music, trying to make a living from his passion. And no matter how hard he tries to be an asshole, I still felt myself rooting for him at every turn. It's the music. Whenever he picks up a guitar and starts singing one of his songs, you see him baring his soul. But the Coens are cruel masters. Every time he is allowed to speak through his music, he is more often than not yanked back to reality, taking us with him. I love that shared frustration between an audience and a character, it linked me to him, helped me appreciate his plight and in this particular case, his music even more.This being a Coen film it is natural to start looking for a layer beyond the story. In this case it is hidden in plain sight. Llewyn is the cat. The cat is Ullyses. He is lost, adrift with many ports of call but none to call his home. I loved the nautical themes embedded in the story, his sailor father, his decision to actually disembark and drift even farther and some of the songs, they're all there, emphasizing that we are watching a man's journey, or at least an essential part of it.Another thing that the Coens do brilliantly is structure their story like the Ouroboros. This is much like that snake eating its own tail, or tale if you will. The ending is the beginning is the ending. That gives that last wry smile Davis gives us, mumbling Au Revoir, all the more weight. He is stuck in his own cycle and unless he gives in to life's compromises he'll stay there forever, cold, lonely and adrift.It's too soon to tell, but this could very well turn out to be my favorite film by the brothers. Time will tell, but for now I'll stick that unbelievable soundtrack on repeat and drift off.",8,0,0,4 December 2019
Joy," Russel & Lawrence & De Niro & Cooper Part 1
","This movie is about the invention of a mop. Sounds boring right? Nope. David O. Russell and Jennifer Lawrence manages to make a story about the invention of a mop super engrossing and fun.A lot of people are disliking Joy and I'm sitting here trying to figure out why. Like Steve Jobs and Straight Outta Compton, Joy isn't your typical biopic. It's energetic, fun, and has a whole lotta heart. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely fantastic. Her second best performance to date; her best being Silver Linings Playbook. The ensemble cast is great. Even though Cooper and DeNiro don't get a whole lot of screen time, they make the most out of it. Both were excellent.Sure the film is a little messy and it slows down a bit once the third act hits, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the heck out of Joy. 2015 is the year of unconventional biopics and they're all turned out to be excellent.",6,0,0,15 March 2020
The Breakfast Club," Just a classic - the birth of the teen/school genre
","I always feel a little apprehensive going into older movies that are so universally loved like the very, very popular The Breakfast Club. Films of this type instill in me all manner of preconceived notions because they are so engrained in the pop culture consciousness and as a result, though I have not seen them, I feel as though I already have. Even though this movie was before my time, I felt optimistic that I would most likely enjoy it to some degree but would also somehow be unable to fully embrace it without the luxury of the added nostalgic good will that often comes from seeing these things in one's youth. It turns out that The Breakfast Club was able to transcend all of this baggage I brought with me and prove to be the real deal. I loved this film.The dork, the jock, the rebel, the beauty queen and the eccentric artist are all forced to coexist in the same situation together, a High School weekend detention. Though these five individuals would never interact in their day to day routines, here they are forced to learn about and understand each other for the common purpose of making the best of their oppressive situation and their mutual hate of the hypocritical and authoritative Vice Principal who rules the day with an iron fist. Initially they show hostility to each other, still programed to focus on their differences, even the ways they eat lunch are vastly different, but through some well-written conversations and the more they explore each other's personal lives, the closer they come to realization that they are all the same. All of this sounds extremely clichÃ© and it's a story we have seen in many different manifestations over the years yet somehow, miraculously, everything that transpires in The Breakfast Club feels completely believable, honest and most importantly, original. It is a common phenomenon, usually seen in war situations or prison, where different walks of life are able to work together to ameliorate the time spent together. Friendships are formed hard and fast because there is really no alternative. John Hughes brilliantly applies this concept to an environment that we can all be familiar with. All of the cliques and characters' social images become irrelevant when removed from the harsh gazes of their judgmental and petty peer base. The entire cast is magnificent and I even liked the mysterious and omniscient janitor character that really has no basis for being there other than just an added bonus to appreciate.The film ends with new relationships formed and the five come out the other side as their own new clique. One of the things I like best about The Breakfast Club in retrospect is that there was never a sequel. That would have ruined the ending. We the audience are left with the choice to wonder that, when Monday rolls around, will these 5 be walking into school together proudly hand in hand, or will they snap right back into the preassigned social niches to avoid all of the explaining that would surely need to follow. That's going to tell you about your own outlook on life how you choose to imagine it. I don't feel that this experience is going to seep into their Monday-Friday school days but I like to think that when Bender is sitting in his next two months of detention by himself, he can look forward to some visitors stopping by to keep him company, if only through a window. Or maybe Bender has always been there and always will be, a sort of grungy spirit guide, waiting to shepard each new group that filters through.",8,0,2,9 March 2020
The Martian," The Martian
","I absolutely love space. Between the unknown, the grand scale, and the unlimited possibilities; space is something I find fascinating. As a kid there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to become an astronaut when I grew up. As I got older I knew that it wouldn't be a possibility. It's no surprise that space films are my favorite types of films. Science Fiction is my favorite genre and when the sci-fi movie takes place in space, oh man I'm like a kid in a candy store while watching a science fiction space film. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Gravity, Alien, Aliens, Moon, and Interstellar are all films that I consider to be some of my all-time favorites. After seeing The Martian its not too far off from those other films. This is great, but not quite on the same level as the space films I mentioned above.As of late, Ridley Scott hasn't exactly been top notch. I did like Prometheus, but many did not. I hated The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings was incredibly boring. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little worried about The Martian despite its fantastic cast and great subject material (I read the book).The Martian has restored my faith in Ridley Scott's ability as a director. In all honestly, I think Ridley deserves an Oscar Nomination for best director. The direction in this movie is nothing short of outstanding. This movie looks absolutely fantastic. Mars looked incredible. Space looked incredible. Everything looked incredible! From a technical standpoint, this is phenomenal.Like Ridley Scott, Matt Damon gives his best work in years. A great comeback film for both of these guys. All the performances are great. I was most surprised by Kristen Wiig. I don't think I've ever seen her in a non-comedy role and to my surprise she ended up being pretty great here.My one problem with the movie is that it drags on in some parts. Also, the book is better. Which isn't a knock or an issue I had with the movie. I'm just saying that I preferred the book over the movie.",9,1,2,17 November 2019
