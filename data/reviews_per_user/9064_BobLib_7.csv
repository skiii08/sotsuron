The Sound of Music," The once and future ultimate feel-good movie!
","I've been reading some of my fellow correspondents' comments on what a musical sugar plum 'The Sound of Music' was and what inferior songwriting talents Rodgers and Hammerstein were. And my reply is simple: C'mon, nay-sayers! Whistle me, without having to think about it, any three Andrew Lloyd Weber or Stephen Sondheim songs. Ha! I thought you couldn't!It's true that, as musicians, Rodgers and Hammerstein may not have been in the same league with Gershwin, Berlin, or Bernstein. But none of those worthies had the consistent knack for honest sentiment that Rodgers and Hammerstein did. That's why all of their shows, including 'Sound of Music,' remain constantly popular and constantly revived, by both professional and non-professional groups. And that's especially why the movie version of their last show together, 'The Sound of Music' remains a favorite of so many people after so many years, including yours truly.Because this is where all the elements come together. Gentle humor, love, honest sentiment, hope in the face of adversity. They're all here, and then some. And that marvelous cast is what made these qualities come alive. Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Peggy Wood, Eleanor Parker, and Richard Haydn were never better then they are here. And the actors playing the children were natural, effortless charmers, one and all. Add to this the beautiful on-location photography in Austria, Robert Wise's dead-on direction, and Ted McCord's beautiful camera work. I ask you: How could anyone NOT like this movie?!?!?Take that, nay-sayers!",Null,0,5,28 September 1999
Pitch Black," First class sci-fi to rank with the best!
","Just got back from seeing this film, and I have absolutely no qualms about stating that this is thinking person's sci-fi on the order of the first two 'Alien' movies and the original 'The Thing.' Anyone expecting escapist stuff in the manner of the 'Star Wars' and later 'Star Trek' films would do well to stay away. This is not for the faint of either heart or stomach!All of the performances stand out, but the two leads are what really hold this film together. Male lead Vin Diesel is alternately terrifying and sympathetic as the not-as-bad-as-he- seems ex-con who becomes a hero in spite of himself. Radha Mitchell is the gutsy lady pilot who is initially repelled by Diesel yet comes to eventually rely on him. While there's never even a hint of romance between the two, you can see the chemistry between them almost from the beginning. And Cole Hauser is Johns, the suitably smarmy villain of the piece, who eventually gets his cumuppance at the hands of the space aliens. These aliens, by the way, are almost always seen in shadow, being nocturnal creatures. One wonders what they'd look like in broad daylight. Chances are, one wouldn't want to know.I won't give away the double surprise of an ending. I'll just say that this is the best edge-of-your-seat sci-fi to come along in many a year. And even if you're not a sci-fi buff, you owe it to yourself to see this film for some first-rate suspense.",Null,0,0,18 February 2000
Doctor Zhivago," One of the greatest, bar none!
","If you don't fall in love with 'Doctor Zhivago,' there's something wrong with you. One of the last large-scale epics produced by MGM, it is, as Omar Sharif says in his introduction to the video edition, 'a film which appeals to the romantic in all of us.'Omar Sharif IS Yuri Zhivago, and it's a crime that he wasn't even nominated for the Best Actor Oscar that year. As the physician/poet cought up in the turbulent years of the Bolshevik Revolution, he conveys all the feelings of a great soul in an insane situation. Julie Christie should have won the Oscar for this film instead of 'Darling' the same year. She gives a more carefully thought out, subtly nuanced performance as Lara, Zhivago's great love. Rod Steiger is his usual over-the-top self as the villianous opportunist Kamarovsky, but he dominates his scenes so thoroughly that one can't help but concentrate on him whenever he's on screen. Tom Courtenay was the only Oscar-nominated actor of the bunch, and his Pasha Antipov, who goes from idealistic student to 'Strongman of the Steppes,' is a good, strong performance.The real star of the film, though, is Freddie Young's Oscar-winning camerawork. If you're going to see 'Zhivago' for the first time, try to see it in letterbox. You'll never really appreciate the magnificent scenery any other way. And, of course, Maurice Jarre's beautiful score is the icing on the cake.",Null,0,0,3 November 1999
U-571," Latest entry in a great tradition is more than up to the test.
","Make no mistake, even if it is a bit weak on historical accuracy, 'U-571' is one to rank with 'Run Silent, Run Deep,' 'Ice Station Zebra,' and 'The Bedford Incident' as one of the great submarine movies of all time.Set in the early days of World War II, when the allies were taking a massive walloping, it deals with the efforts of a handful of submarine crewmen to retrieve a valuable coding device from a partially disabled German submarine, the eponymous vehicle. I won't give away anymore of the plot than that, except to say that, if you're looking for an action-packed thrill-ride of a movie, 'U-571' delivers and than some.The performances are all top-notch, particulary Matthew Macaughnehy as the executive officer who suddenly finds himself in command. His crew includes always reliable Harvey Keitel (who should get an Emmy nomination for 'Fail-Safe,' but probably won't) and a suprisingly good Jon Bon Jovi. I almost didn't recognize Tom 'The Sandlot' Guiry, all grown up, but he turns in a good performance, as well, as the young crewman who manages to save the mission but loses his own life in the process.In short, if you're looking for one of the best action pictures to come along in years, 'U-571' is definitely it.",Null,1,2,23 April 2000
Titanic," A Film that Re-Defines Its Genre
","If 'Gone With the Wind' could be said to define the movie epic in the first half of the 20th century, than 'Titanic' can certainly be said to define it for the second half. Both films are set against significant moments in history, both have spectacular special effects, both have love story subplots. But, most importantly, both have heart and a real respect for their audience, something you seldom see any more. Certainly no film since 'GWTW' has had this much publicity blitz. And no film INCLUDING 'GWTW' has had as large an audience at its opening. Even though you've probably seen both films several times, if you're like me, you'll never tire of seeing them again. And that's the mark of a true classic.",Null,1,3,14 July 1999
Cinderella Man," Triumphant Tribute to a Real-Life Rocky
","'The Bulldog of Bergen,' Jim Braddock was a fighter who came out of the depths of the Depression to win the World Heavyweight Championship against incredible odds, one who lived to see himself honored as a folk hero, a legend of sports, and one of New Jersey's first citizens. Had he lived long enough to see Ron Howard's excellent film on his life, 'Cinderella Man,' he would have almost certainly approved.A box-office disappointment when released, and all but overlooked at the Oscars, 'Cinderella Man' is, nonetheless, one of the best films of 2005 in the opinion of everyone I've known who has seen it, as well as myself. As much as Peter Jackson in 'King Kong,' Howard and his team take a grimy, unsentimental look at the Depression Era that is both fascinating and unsettling at the same time. The New Jersey/New York area of Braddock's time, as well as such venues as the old Madison Square Garden Bowl in Long Island City, are faithfully and meticulously recreated. Howard's direction is, as always, right on top of things. The pace doesn't slacken for a minute, the storytelling always grabs you.But technical aspects are only part of what makes a movie great. There are also the performances, and in this respect, 'Cinderella Man''s cast doesn't disappoint. Russell Crowe gives his best performance yet (And, no, I'm not forgetting Howard's earlier 'A Beautiful Mind') as Braddock. He doesn't play the part, he IS the part, gentle and loving with his family, a hard worker on the docks, a tiger in the ring. Renee Zellweger effectively de-glamorizes herself as Braddock's loving wife, Mae, tender yet tough. Paul Giamatti definitely earned his Oscar nomination as Braddock's best friend/manager Joe Gould, who won't give up on Jim even when everybody else has. And Craig Bierko gives an appropriately over-the-top performance as Max Baer, Sr., the flamboyant champ, a devil with the ladies and in the ring, whom Braddock challenges for the championship. This was the performance that motivated Baer's son, actor/producer Max Baer, Jr. (Jethro on 'The Beverly Hillbillies'), to sue the producers, claiming, justifiably, that they presented a very one-sided view of his father, turning him, for the sake of a good story, into a villain he was far from being.All in all, a great movie about the triumph of the human spirit. Once you see it, you will never forget it, and always want to come back again.Incidentally, the DVD of 'Cinderella Man' (a nickname for Braddock coined by Damon Runyon) features several interesting bonus features. There is a commentary track by Ron Howard, cut scenes, newsreel footage of Braddock in action, and interviews with Braddock's family.",10,0,0,18 August 2006
The Wizard of Oz," Still a whiz of a 'Wiz' all these years later!
","I thoroughly agree with the many who see 1939 as the single greatest year in the history of American Film. What other year can boast a list of successes, both critical and box office, on the order of: 'Gone with the Wind,' 'Love Affair,' 'Dark Victory,' 'Juarez,' 'The Roaring Twenties,' 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' 'Babes in Arms,' 'Beau Geste,' 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' 'Union Pacific,' 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips,' 'Wuthering Heights,' 'Drums Along the Mohawk,' and on and on? And one of the greatest of these is still 'The Wizard of Oz,' probably the best family film ever made some sixty years after it was released.This is a film where everything works. Most notably, there is the casting. With the possible exception of her 'Vicki Lester' in 'A Star is Born,' Judy Garland never had a better cinematic vehicle for her talents than right here. Even when one knows her history of personal and professional heartbreak, her Dorothy  Gale can still make believers of us all, while simultaneously causing us to regret what might have been had Louis B. Mayer stayed out of the pharmaceutical business. Ray Bolger brings his usual effortless charm to his best-known role, the Scarecrow. Jack Haley, Sr. rarely had a better vehicle for his understated brand of humor than the Tin Man. And the great Bert Lahr can still elicit his share of belly-laughs as the Cowardly Lion. Frank Morgan brings his usual dithery charm to Professor Marvel/The Wizard. And, Finally, Margaret Hamilton can still elicit a good old-fashioned scare in the role that would make her immortal, the Wicked Witch of the West. Interestingly, in real life, everybody who knew her had only the nicest of things to say about her. A single mother at a time when such things were less common than they are now, she was, by all accounts, a loving Mom to her only child, journalist Hamilton Maserve.Now to the technical end of things. If Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg had written the score to 'Oz' and nothing else, that alone would have put them among the immortals. A. Arnold 'Buddy' Gillespie's special effects were state of the art for that age, and how they could have lost the Oscar to 'Suez'  is beyond me. Harold Rossen's camerawork makes it all come alive, like a dream come to life. But the biggest suprise is the director. Victor Fleming was best known as a dramatic director ('The Virginian,' 'Red Dust,' 'Test Pilot') whose one previous attempt at a musical, 'Reckless,' with Jean Harlow, was a high-budget bomb. This, however, doesn't prepare one for his work on 'Oz,' in which he captures the sense of fantasy, whimsey, and, yes, menace, in a way no other director probably could. He would win the Best Director Oscar that year, not for 'Oz' but for 'Gone with the Wind.'In short, 'Oz' was, is, and always will be a delight, due both to its charming story and the dedicated team of professionals who made sure that 'dreams really do come true.'",Null,0,0,24 November 1999
