It," Solid 1st half. Disappointing 2nd half.
","I feel 5 star is a bit generous tbh but the first half was good. It built the characters, the environment, and the suspense nicely. I grew attached to the motley group of kids. it is the 2nd half where everything comes undone. It was trite and tiring. Jump-scares were predictable, suspense was uninspiring, the characters looked dull af. Lack of creativity from the filmmaker was plain to see. It seemed they crammed in every kind of horror movie clliches they know in hopes that something will stick.I have not read the book but I have read other works of Stephen King and I know his writing; it is very consistent and well thought out. I would be very disappointed if the movie turns out to be a faithful adaptation.",5,1,1,15 January 2018
