United 93," Greengrass Got It Right
","If you're looking for movie stars and pyrotechnics this is not the movie for you. Paul Greengrass did an excellent job of combining fact with conjecture without making any part of the story larger-than-life. By using a relatively unknown cast, (even the real-life traffic controllers), he managed to pull off an incredibly controversial movie with grace, and more importantly, responsibility.The fact is, we really don't know exactly what happened during the morning of 9/11 aboard any of the four hijacked aircrafts. What we do have are the phone conversations and cockpit voice recorders that are not only choppy, but unclear at times amid the confusion. Greengrass was tasked with combining fact with the unknowable and rather than glamorizing the story of United Flight 93, he told a story that was not only plausible, but likely as close to the raw truth as humanly possible.This movie is a must-see for any American who can bare to re-live that fateful day. It greatly helps bring to life the events that transpired from the moment the first airplane left Boston, to the confusion and uncertainty air traffic-control faced to the courage of a group of strangers who will forever live in our hearts and minds as the silent hero's or September 11th, 2001.",10,11,24,28 April 2006
