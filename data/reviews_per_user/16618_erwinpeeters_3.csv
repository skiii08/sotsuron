"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Not anything new, couple of laughs, some clich√©s, but still entertaining
","Is this anything new? No it is not. We have seen this kind of movie before. Estranged father wants to win his family back by doing something stupid.Is this well directed? No not really. Is this well acted? No not really. Has this a good story? No not really.But.... and yes there is a but, at least for me. This movie actually made me laugh out loud a couple of times. Not many movies can say that. No this is not a great movie, like i said above.I still think it is a quirky movie that is worth watching. Don't expect to much and just watch it",7,0,1,3 August 2016
Child 44," Wrong cast and mediocre script
","I was so looking forward to this movie because i have read the books by Tom Rob Smith which this film is based on.When i heard it was going to be produced by Ridley Scott i got even more excited. But when i heard that Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace were cast my excitement dwindled. Because in my head the characters didn't look anything like them when i read the books. But that isn't always a negative when finally seeing the film because they can surprise you.Well they didn't. Tom Hardy is way too buff for this role and does not portray the inner turmoil the character has in the books. His face just looks always the same. Noomi Rapace was brilliant in the Millennium trilogy but has yet to convince me she can act in Hollywood movies.So the acting didn't convince, so maybe the script saved it. No it did not. So many things that are essential in the story are just not in it. If you haven't read the book i presume it's very hard to grasp why certain decisions were made by the characters or why certain things happen.So i think the cast is wrong, the script is not too good but i still give it a 6 out of 10. I think the direction was OK, the production was good and all in all it is not a bad film but i expected so much more.Maybe they should have given a more experienced director this job.",6,5,10,24 July 2015
John Wick," Way way over the top... and i love it!!
","Let me start by saying this movie is not for everyone, it has a lot of violence and the story is very thin.So why do i love it do you say? I grew up with the over the top movies of the 80's like Commando,Rambo and so on. I loved those when i was young, if i watch them now i can't make it further then 10 minutes but John Wick took me back to those times.In recent years a lot of directors tried to make a movie like this and failed simply because they took themselves too seriously. John Wick just is what it is, a very violent movie without any pretense to being more. The direction is great, the production is great, the acting is good. It takes me back to the movies of my youth.Of course this is isn't the best movie ever made, Michael Nyqvist shouldn't be in a Hollywood production in my opinion and what i don't like of the modern movies is the very obvious CGI wounds and blood, it is just not good and very distracting.But i give this movie a solid 8, i really enjoyed it, don't expect too much just relax and watch it",8,8,20,13 January 2015
