Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars It Is NOT.. But..
","Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the Phantom Menace.  However, for fanatics of the originals, like myself, it did have some drawbacks.  For instance, there were just too many computer generated characters and images.  I know that many movies are all about special effects and that is what draws people to them, but Star Wars movies are NOT like anything else.  I would rather have seen a movie that was less theatrical and more like the originals.  In defense of Lucus, I guess he was just trying to stamp the new millennium on Episode One.  The plot was as good as I would have expected, for a lead-off film.  Little Anakin was certainly no acting marvel.  However, there are scenes were you can see what his character short-comings are, which will eventually lead him to become Darth Vader.  I was impressed by Liam Neeson's role.  His powerful screen presence was certainly a positive for the film. I am confident that in the coming years as Episodes Two and Three hit the screens, the stories will improve significantly.
