Ford v Ferrari," Le Mans '66 (2019) Review by Infectious Reviews
","'Le Mans '66' (Ford v Ferrari), directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line), is a feel-good family flick that looks at the true story of Ford's car designer Carroll Shelby, played by Matt Damon (The Martian) and his driver Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale (The Dark Knight) - where they go head to head with Ferrari in the 1966 'Le Mans' motorsport race.My first impression of the film, after watching the trailer, was; 'this looks and feels like 'Rush'.' 2013's 'Rush', directed by Ron Howard, a film I enjoyed very much - felt comforting and easy-going - even though there is a literal turn for the worse, there's still a warmness to the narrative that feels very smart and cool (at all corners). I was imagining 'Le Mans '66' to be very similar to 'Rush', and thankfully it was - my expectations were met. It had all the same coolness, slick dialogue and fast story. What appealed to me during both films was their aesthetically pleasing setting. I found myself wanting to be in the South of France or Northern Italy, laying in the sun and drinking a beer. 'Le Mans '66' draws you into to its ambience so well and it actually makes you feel present. I have watched it twice now and could easily watch it again, especially when the weather is looking grey.A few pointers - looking at the technical side of film, the pacing was good as it kept the story fun and engaging though the duration of the film could have been shorter. Some scenes were not particularly interesting or necessary. There was a lot of exposition during the first act which had me wishing for a more conversational dialogue. A lot of what happened could have been explained in a less amount of time. Even so, it wasn't something I cared much about - its production value and sixties appeal had me glued to the screen. However, it was sometimes hard to settle down because of Bale's, over-the-top, accentuated accent but again, as time progresses, it was not something that bothered me throughout. Having said this, I thought Shelby and Miles' on screen relationship was joyful and convincing. Their narrative was interesting and gave me a better understanding about a story I never knew existed. Sometimes biopics have a better way of delivering information - due to their motivating characterisations and re-imaging of crucial events. For example, the racing sequences have more emphasis than actuality, (don't hold me to this - I have never been to a race in my life). However, the brilliant 'Academy Award' wining sound, edited by Donald Sylvester (Logan) and the great use of camera work by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (Nebraska) - puts you behind the wheel of the iconic 'Ford GT40'.For someone that has a mild interest in cars and motorsport - I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone - especially if you have a fascination about exhaust pipes.",8,2,3,4 April 2020
Knives Out," Knives Out (2019) Review
","Going into 'Knives Out'; I was sceptical about a murder mystery including all these big names and from first glance, looked like it was just, going to be okay. In spite of my assumption - when the film finished; I was instantly on the phone to my girlfriend and couldn't stop saying 'you have to watch this film!'. She then replied by saying 'that's nice honey (yawns)' and then put the phone down. We thankfully watched it together and Gala - my wonderful girlfriend, really enjoyed it.We both loved the fact that it was a whodunit - bringing all the best elements of the genre and more. The way the narrative jumped around the basic foundation of a 'Agatha Christie type story' - had us second guessing every milestone and it was brilliant. I never knew what was round the corner of each clue - even if I thought I did. Everything was so clear but equally surprised me when something huge was revealed. It was both fun and tense - making Gala and I gasp at how amazingly well told the story was.As well as its great story and inventive screenplay, written by Johnson, we loved all the themes - particularly its stance on class and immigration. These two motifs had a very big, but unexpected impact, making it slightly political without trying too hard to be an obvious statement - giving us something quite unique and subtle. These political arguments are woven in through the dialogue and characters in a way that really brings out each persona to everyone present, in this twisting tale.All the performances are great - especially Daniel Craig's (Casino Royale) Benoit Blanc - with his unexpected Southern accent and humorous metaphors about donuts - putting a smile on our faces every time he walked onto set. Its hard to talk about all great performances and likably ironic characters, as they all have a part to play in this mystery solving adventure. However, Ana de Armas (Blade Runner 2049) gave a great performance as well as seeing Chris Evans (Avengers: Endgame) back to his old school - 'jock persona'. You can see he has really come a long way, since his debut as Captain America in 'Marvel's' 'Captain America: The First Avenger'.Even though this film has a big cast - I wasn't even conscious of the fact that they were all A'list actors. After the first ten minutes, I could honestly believe that they were all very real people such as; Michael Shannon (The Shape of Water) playing the creepy son of Christopher Plummer (All the Money in the World) - also, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and Toni Collette (Hereditary); all played very different roles from previous appearances. Each and every one of their conversations were so engaging that you could really see what brilliant actors they all are. Each character ends up being able to show their true colours at some point in the film. When all of the craziness come to an end - theres a great message, relating back to the political undertone which was just as unanticipated as the whodunit reveal.What also gave 'Knives Out' its particular feel was the amazing production and set design by David Crank (The Master) and David Schlesinger (John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum), for their wonderfully intricate attention to detail - amazing collection on weird and quirky antiques which really brought the house to life. It was like breathing through the mind of a old and eccentric explorer. As well, Jenny Eagan's (Beasts of No Nation) beautiful costume design just had me dazzled in all its aesthetically pleasing bright colours that brought a thirties vibe with a modern twist giving a balance between a contemporary thriller and a generic mystery.'Knives Out' is a film I recommend very highly and is one of my favourite features of last year - if you are into a new spin on Christies' beloved classics and maybe need a break from Jessica Fletcher; this is the one for you. Exceptionally brilliant and daring!",8,1,2,8 April 2020
How to Train Your Dragon," How To Train Your Dragon (2010) Review
","'How to Train Your Dragon' is based on the 2003 book series by Cressida Cowell. During pre-production, Deblois and Sanders took over writing the plot from Bonnie Arnold (producer) and decided to steer it away from working too closely to the book. They said they did not want to make it too childish and 'whimsical'. Instead they made slight changes, making the film appeal to a wider audience.A hapless young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed. The story itself is very simple and predictable - being a film for children. But simplicity and predictability never tend to bother me; so long that, it is kept tight and runs smoothly - which 'How to Train Your Dragon' does, seamlessly. Having said this, the first few times I watched 'How to Train Your Dragon' - the film seemed off in structure and didn't really jump out at me for being the masterpiece it is today. However, the pacing and transitions work so well - the whole film gracefully jumps from one scene to the next. Theres a particular moment where the character Stoick, voiced by Gerard Butler (300), comes back from his travels and asks another character about his sons whereabouts. This then leads into a tremendous 'crash' - an amazing sequence that I will later talk about. The whole film gives you enough time to understand each character and their development throughout. The main protagonist Hiccup, voiced by Jay Baruchel (This is the End), was one of the main focuses that drew me into the story. I felt that his character resembled much of my own - 'hapless' but often finding his own way around oncoming obstacles. This is something that has been done, time and time again, and Hiccup is without a doubt, a cliche'. Nonetheless, his growth into the confident and 'strong' viking; had me weeping as if I had accomplished something of great importance.The first time I actually watched 'How to Train Your Dragon' was in the summer of 2011; one year after it had been released. I remember catching it every time it was on 'Sky Movies' - and really remember properly watching it with my mum. It was just after I had passed my driving theory test, haplessly on my second attempt. This was a big moment for me and I really fell in love with the film. Mum and I would then go on to watching both; 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' and 'How to Train your Dragon: The Hidden World', in cinemas, on the week of their release. What we both realised, during this time, was how freakishly funny the relationship between Hiccup and his father Stoick, was very similar to the relationship I have with my step dad - a man who can endure lots of pain through hard times but is also incredibly stubborn and conservative. Whereas I am quite flexible and radical. This theme of conflicting personalities works so well as an obstacle whilst Hiccup strives, for a better future. This had me thinking about how films like 'How to Train Your Dragon', can really use its premise to inflict good morale, through its sweet and funny storyline. 'How to Train Your Dragon' has touched me on so many emotional levels. In fact, one evening (early hours), during my time at university, I was sobbing my eyes out - thinking 'wow', this film is spectacular on so many levels.The first act of 'How to Train Your Dragon' starts off loud and fresh - introducing all the key characters through a well written monologue. We get a clear view of the setting, sense of humour and a taste for what is to come. Watching 'How to Train Your Dragon' now, actually seems like a blast from the past - I cannot believe it is ten years old. Because of this, the animation seems quite dated but is still, to this day, beautifully represented. The animation also has a particular style that I was not completely on board with. The film seemed clunky and not completely rendered, but because of the nature and atmosphere of the film, the animation suits it unbelievably well - you start to realise how detailed and aesthetically pleasing it all really is.What I found interesting about the making of 'How to Train Your Dragon' is that the cinematographer Roger Deakins (1917 and Blade Runner 2049) was a visual consultant for all three films - helping with the lighting and making the films look more 'live-action'. This can be seen through its epic action sequences and gorgeous backgrounds. The scene that begins with the tremendous 'crash', that I previously talked about, is when Hiccup takes his new friend, Toothless the dragon, out for a 'Test Flight'. In this sequence, Hiccup is riding Toothless through the air as they test out Toothless' new tail, in order to help Toothless fly again. What is so amazing about this flight sequence is the music that 'crashes' down, alerting the audience that the film is instantly getting more epic. The score that was written by John Powell (The Bourne Identity), has such a brilliant variety of themes which, I find myself humming whilst, remembering how perfectly composed and well integrated they all are.Another scene that captures this same brilliance is when Hiccup and Astrid, voiced by America Ferrera (Ugly Betty), are riding Toothless through the air to the theme of 'Romantic Flight'. The stunning visuals - flying through great big clouds amongst a beautiful sunset, and then diving into a blue, moonlit night - whilst this heartfelt tune builds up from an alluring Irish/Scottish violin, to a delightfully epic ochrestra; has me falling in love, with the film, every time I watch it. For the first time, Powell was nominated for the Oscar, but lost to Trent Reznor's (Gone Girl) and Atticus Ross' (Love & Mercy) brilliant score for 'The Social Network', directed by David Fincher. 'How to Train Your Dragon' was also nominated for 'Best Animated Feature Film' but lost to 'Toy Story 3', directed by Lee Unkrich. For most people and I, at the time, this was an easy win for the 'Toy Story' franchise. But looking back; 'How to Train Your Dragon' is so much more than just an animated film for children. There is a seriousness to it, that makes it just as important as the other films that were included in my top ten. Don't get me wrong; 'Toy Story 3' is an sensational film - an emotional rollercoaster that had me looking back at those wonderful childhood memories. But 'How to Train Your Dragon' still cuts deeper.'Boasting dazzling animation, a script with surprising dramatic depth, and thrilling 3-D sequences, How to Train Your Dragon soars.' - Rotten TomatoesTheres a few moments in act three where the story takes new strides to grand moments of heroism and an action packed finale. Throughout the film there are so many great, dialogue driven scenes with Hiccup and his father, Stoick. As Hiccup develops into a more, confident and understanding person - Stoick's stubbornness is his main threat against everything he has achieved. Being both funny and frustrating, as Stoick tries to have 'normal' conversations with his son, about dragon slaying - Hiccup is never given the opportunity to speak his own mind or share his feelings. After Stoick finds out about Hiccups secret (being friends with a dragon), Stoick looses his temper in a heartbreaking scene, that feels brutally harsh and real. The moment when Stoick throws Hiccup aside and says; 'You've thrown your lot in with them. You're not a Viking... You're not my son.' - genuinely has me in bits. What gets to me even more, is when Stoick walks out on the conversation and looks as if he is taken back by what he has just said. The expression on his face gives such a sense of 'actual' emotion, its hard to side with the fact that the film is still animated. This narrative is beautifully summarised - just before Hiccup takes on his biggest challenge - Hiccup and Toothless are saved by Stoick, who then says taking his hand: 'I'm proud to call you my son.' Hiccup replies; 'Thanks, dad.' and takes off. This is very warm moment that is delivered so perfectly as it shows two brilliant characters conclude their development.Theres a couple more points during the third act; one of them being when Hiccup and Toothless save Astrid from falling. Just after they set her off on her feet, she says 'Go', which at first seems 'cheesy', but because of all the crucial events beforehand - it is very fitting and the cherry on the top just before, Hiccup and Toothless sore off to fight the big, evil dragon. However, I do not think this sentiment could be conveyed through a live-action film. Theres a lot that 'How to Train Your Dragon' gets away with (being an animated feature), but equally it does not shy away from taking risks, at being more than just a film for a young audience.The other point is - when all the fighting is done, when you think Hiccup has fallen to his fate; theres a moment of relief - but not the ending everyone was expecting. When Hiccup looses part of his left leg, theres a bitter-sweet tone - as he wakes up and discovers that he is actually disabled. The piece of music that is played in this small part - a version of the main theme played on piano, in a minor key - suits the feel of the scene so well; it conjures all these mixed emotions together, creating a fitting end for a beautiful and well developed friendship. Both, partially tailess Toothless and now partially legless Hiccup, need each other in order to function as one. I could go on forever about how beautifully woven this ending is, but it is time I conclude this review.",10,0,0,4 April 2020
