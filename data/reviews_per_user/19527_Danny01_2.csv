Mission: Impossible III," Waste of Money
",This movie sucks!!!!!!!! here are a few reasons why. 1.Horrible screenplay 2.Horrible script 3.Tom Cruse is a horrible actor 4.No plot 5.Crapy movie trilogy since number one 6.Camera is shaky (could just be the projector though) Save your money and don't see this movie! I would not rent this movie if it was the last movie in the world! I wouldn't even watch this movie on T.V. for free! ( I would really give this movie negative 10 stars it was so bad!) Of course this is my humble opinion of this movie. I am sure there are many people who think that this movie rocks and huzzah for them but as for me I do not think I will ever be able to tell people how much I hate this movie! If I were rich I would stand outside the theater and pay people not to see this horrid excuse for a movie!!!!!!!!!,1,1,3,16 May 2006
Glory Road," A must see!
","I went to this movie with absolutely no interest. I am not one who really pays much attention to sports of any kind, but this movie was totally awesome!!! Kudos to the director and everyone that was involved with this movie! Even if you don't like basketball you should see this movie! I have already seen it twice, and I will probably go with all of my friends to see it! I have recommended this movie to everyone I have talked to since I saw it on Saturday, even if I didn't really know the person! I promise that you will enjoy this flick no matter who you are! Bottom line: This movie ROCKS!!!!!! P.S.-If you didn't like the movie tell why! :)",10,3,12,17 January 2006
