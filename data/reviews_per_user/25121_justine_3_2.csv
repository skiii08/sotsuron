Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Plot
","Like the three young actors who star in it, this is a good looking film and the director has done a great job with what is, in my opinion,  an unremarkable storyline.  The music video style may seem at odds with the serious message of the film, but I think that  this is the only way the director could inject (pun probably intended) some interest into an uninspiring plot. We all know about the dangers of drugs and the comparison between  addiction to illegal and prescription drugs is one that has been made plenty of times before so I think that any film about drugs/addiction made these days needs to offer something more.I don't think that you necessarily have to care about characters in a film, but you at least have to be interested in them.  Whilst the mother is a fairly sympathetic character (and fantastically acted), her fate is pretty obvious from the start, so seeing her pop pills soon becomes boring and the other three characters are weak, in particular the girlfriend Marion who is nothing more than a series of cliches.   I lost interest in all of them for the middle section of the  film and although the sheer brutality of the climax drew me back in, it didn't compensate for the boredom that had gone before - perhaps this is a comment on the boring repetitive nature of addiction, but it doesn't make good cinema, no matter how fancy the editing techniques are. Comparisons have been made with Trainspotting, which to me is a far better film, not only because the characters are more realistic and interesting, but because its portrayal of drugs is more honest, showing that people take drugs for pleasure and not always end in tragedy. In comparison Requiem comes across like a reactionary education film.",Null,0,0,17 September 2001
The Others," Promises more than it delivers
","This is director Alejandro Amen√°bar's first feature film in English,having previously worked in Spanish, and certainly the film doeshave a European quality to it, making a welcome change from therecent crop of Hollywood thrillers such as What Lies Beneath andUnbreakable.  However, this is not to say that The Others is anoutright success.   Nicole Kidman deserves credit for taking achance on a relatively unknown director, but despite when of herbest performances to date, her character is too  neurotic and herreligious fervour which she inflicts upon the children, prevents herfrom gaining our full sympathy.   However, the main reason that The Others disappoints is that itsimply isn't scary enough.   The children lack any kind of creepy oreerie qualities, so we never believe they are malicious, whichwould have added an extra dimension to the suspense.  Likewise, the servants are too homely to ever really be scary and inparticular for a British audience, Eric Sykes as the gardener isnever going to be spooky.   The children's allergy to light wasintended to subvert the horror convention of dark bringing fear andlight bringing salvation.  Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work andinstead just seems like a convenient device to allow most of thefilm's action to take place in the dark.  Nazi occupation of Jersey is mentioned, but doesn't form a majorpart of the plot, which is certainly a missed opportunity to exploremore interesting themes than the straightforward supernatural linethe film chooses to follow.",5,0,1,26 November 2001
