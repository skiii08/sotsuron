Ford v Ferrari," Just goes to show what you can do with a great team...
","This is just great! Bale and Damon are really convincing as a pair of 'individuals' who design and build - with the help of some wooden door wedges - a magnificent feat of motor engineering despite their own personal demons; corporate America - exemplified by a thoroughly odious Josh Lucas and the pretty horrible French weather. Noah Jupe, who plays Bale's son Peter is also superb. The race photography and sound are wonderful - you really do get sucked into the exhilaration of it all. The only thing missing is the smell of the petrol fumes. I was slightly dubious that I could ever want a Ford (think: box, square, dull, Henry Fonda) to defeat a Ferrari (think: sleek. red, classy, James Dean) but in the end, I sort of did. 2½ hours just flies by. Interestingly, there is a distinct paucity of swearing in this film, too. Big screen/sound essential.",8,0,1,18 November 2019
Howl's Moving Castle," As subtle an anti-war story as you will ever see, with plenty of love and generosity too.
","Certainly my favourite Miyazaki film. The animations are a touch angular, but colourfully and stylishly depict this story of a beautiful young girl who is cursed by an evil witch. In despair, she sets off, directionless, from home and comes across 'Howl' and his moving castle - and the sprite 'Calcifer'. She begins a journey of discovery - about herself as much as anything. 'Howl' - the ultimate free spirit is also facing down demons of his own that he is struggling to reconcile with. 'Calcifer' provides the conduit for them to get to better understand each other and also much of the humour as they seek to break the spells that bind them. This works on many different levels and each time I see it, I seem get something different from it.",8,1,1,10 December 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A great action adventure in the best traditions of Hollywood.
","This is trailblazing stuff - a great action film in the vein of earlier Technicolor swashbucklers. Harrison Ford is engaging and hugely charismatic and his battles with Karen Allen and Paul Freeman make for a considered, slightly dark but funny and memorable piece of cinema. So many great films have a depth in the cast that offers a multi-layered approach to storytelling. Spielberg cast John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott excellently as Ford's stalwarts. John Williams has a golden baton when it comes to action-scores (akin to Korngold) and the story clearly has a tint of George Lucas' imagination to it. Historically, there is plenty of fiction but that spoils nothing. Not the best of the series, but a very good start...",7,0,0,18 December 2019
Rocketman," Reg (almost) Strikes Back.
","I enjoyed this, but somehow felt a little underwhelmed! There is something tame about Taron Egerton's performance. Sir Elton has never been shy in admitting to the excesses of his pursuit of happiness in the 70's - perhaps there was a reluctance to have this rated 18 (R) so much of that was left to our imagination? Jamie Bell, Richard Madden and Charlie Rowe make creditable contributions but it still lacks punch! Maybe, so soon after 'Bohemian Rhapsody' it just doesn't quite have the rawness and/or edginess? The soundtrack - provided by Egerton, himself, is the stuff of legend, though and all-in-all it is still a most enjoyable watch.",7,1,1,24 November 2019
Star Trek," Better than the interminable 'Star Trek - Motion Picture' by light years....
","I quite enjoyed this. It is a simple, end-to-end action adventure set in space. It doesn't attempt to moralise or philosophise, it is just an interstellar shoot 'em up. Chris Pine is pretty wooden, Zachary Quinto does a passable Mr. Spock and Anton Yeltsin seems to be having a good time trying to get the onboard computer to recognise his particularly thick accent. Sadly Eric Bana completely lacks menace as 'Nero' and Simon Pegg's 'Scotty' is just plain irritating but the special effects are stunning. If you're just looking for a bit of brain fodder with phasers, then this is your film...",7,7,20,31 December 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Great stand-alone sci-fi in the original 'Star Wars' tradition.
","For some reason, there appears to be a bit of snobbery about the standard of the recent Disney productions, but I thoroughly enjoyed this tangent to the 'Star Wars' brand. Felicity Jones tries to help the rebels obtain the plans for the planet-blasting 'Death Star' that was designed by her father (Mads Mikkelsen). It's end-to-end action, with great special effects and a whole slew of new characters to get to know/like/loathe, without having to have seen any of the other films. Diego Luna and Ben Mendelsohn don't quite cut the mustard for me; and indeed the cast could all gel a bit better as actors; but the story is exciting and much closer to the action-packed style of the first trilogy. What's not to like...?",8,0,1,9 February 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Well worthy of it's Best Picture Oscar nomination
","This is a magical animated interpretation of the Jeanne-Marie de Beaumont fairy tale. A handsome, but vain and selfish, Prince finds himself on the wrong end of a curse - and is condemned to live a life of solitude, hideously disfigured - until someone falls in love with him and breaks the spell. Meantime, 'Belle' is living in the village trying to avoid the endless amorous attentions of local beefcake 'Gaston'. Her father is travelling through the forest when he becomes caught up in a storm and seeks shelter in the Prince's castle - but he picks a rose and is duly imprisoned. When 'Belle' discovers he is missing and follows his horse back to the castle, she manages to get the Prince to agree to swap; they gradually get to know each other and... He has an array of servants who all shared his curse and were transmogrified along with their boss - 'Lumière' the butler/candlestick rules the roost with 'Cogworth', 'Madame de Garderobe' and the wonderful 'Mrs. Potts' (Angela Lansbury) as the teapot/housekeeper with her little 'Chip'. All of these characterisations fit the mood perfectly and as the story develops each one becomes more engaging and sympathetic to their poor inflicted master's predicament, as we build to the really quite tense, but satisfying denouement. The songs - and the singing - are superb; the artwork and colours bring it all to life and the script is fast and funny. It's a thoroughly enjoyable demonstration that looks aren't everything...",8,0,0,2 April 2020
Hotel Rwanda," A powerful reflection of the true horrors of genocide.
","Don Cheadle is super as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Belgian-owned hotel in Kigali in 1994 during the civil strife that saw Hutus relentlessly and ruthlessly persecute the minority Tutsis in Rwanda. Once he is directly touched by one such incident, he decides that he must do something to help and so turns his luxury accommodation into a refuge for hundreds of dispossessed and terrified people. With the help the Red Cross and some foreign press he walks a delicate tightrope trying to keep everyone safe, fed and watered. This is a brave and compelling story of the unimaginable brutality and ultimately compassion that stays with you long after you've finished watching.",8,0,0,12 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Good film ruined by puppets and cuddly toys
","This third of the original Star Wars films is probably my weakest. Possibly because the writing is not too tight but for me, more so because the Ewoks take over the thing and they are just stupidly annoying. What had potential to pitch the ultimate evil partnership again the Rebel Alliance became a toy-fight straight out of a Laurel and Hardy comedy - the storyline was infantile. Still a great film to look at, and enough menace and diversion in the first hour to make it well worth watching.",7,2,3,17 December 2019
Alien," A ruthless battle for survival...
","Back in the day before Sir John Hurt took to being little more than a highly paid cameo-man, he was a great actor and here is a prime example. His merchant ship is travelling through space when it receives a distress call. They stop to help and one of their number becomes infected with a... well, now you have to watch it. Sigourney Weaver is superb as the feisty, no-nonsense 'Ripley' who leads the defence against a beastie that has brute strength, determination, intelligence and an astonishing ability to move at speed through the corridors and conduits of the ship. Ridley Scott allows the tension to rise gently and violently, by degree, and the clever use of sound and light; Jerry Goldsmith's tense score and excellent supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and a wonderfully seedy ian Holm make this a seminal sci-fi horror film that still makes you want to hide behind the sofa - 40 years on!",8,1,2,29 March 2020
Malcolm X," Ground-breaking, but flawed...
","I cannot imagine the hoops Spike Lee must have had to jump through to get any form of investment into either the concept or the production of this truly groundbreaking study of a man who divided opinion in a way few others have since the end of the Second World War. I say a study of man, but this is way more than just about him, it identifies and develops themes about inter and intra racial and gender attitudes and leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. All of that said, it does struggle as a piece of entertainment. I don't mean to trivialise the subject matter, but if it wanted to be a documentary then it should have been more tightly focused on fact and less on the dramatisation of events, some real, some not. As a biopic, it kind of falls between two stools. We are presented with, essentially, a collective of unpleasant individuals who either started out that way, or were corrupted by the environments in which they existed and/or created - clearly illustrated, for example, by the way the women are treated by their husbands/bosses etc. This left me with an overwhelming feeling that had there been more general respect and decency on offer here - across the board - then a lot of the violence from both 'sides' might have been avoided. It is a must see movie, but perhaps time has robbed it of much of it's potency and left us with a sad reflection of a time when vileness didn't care about your colour.",7,1,2,15 November 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A rich, at times, funny tale of tragedy and humanity.
","This is quite a thought-provoking film; made all the more remarkable because the principal character 'Mildred' (Frances McDormand) is really quite a pain in the arse. She comes across as an authoritarian societal 'control freak' who simultaneously acts as a vigilante when it suits her. Quite quickly, you get to the point where you wonder if she ought not to be in some sort of secure accommodation. All of that said, it is exactly these flaws that make this interesting. Her daughter has been brutally raped and killed and she is constantly berating local sheriff Woody Harrelson for not finding the culprits - to the extent that she hires a billboard and says some not very complimentary things about the local PD. Sam Rockwell is his naively provocative deputy who weighs in to help but merely makes matters worse. The characterisations are maybe a bit too two-dimensional and it certainly plays up to stereotypes of 'hick' rural America, but it is a powerful performance-driven drama with plenty of conflicting sub-plots (some more plausible than others) and McDormand is super.",7,0,0,28 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," It has all been said already; an outstanding biopic of a flawed musical genius.
","There are plenty of opinions as to how authentic this is, as a retrospective on the life of Freddie Mercury; but there can be no doubting that the pairing of Rami Malek and Queen's music makes this a captivating couple of hours of cinema. We are taken on the compelling and enthralling roller-coaster that was his life and the excesses of his lifestyle and behaviour are comprehensively conveyed without being at all graphic, or even particularly seedy. Malek is simply magnificent. Tom Hollander is also outstanding too. I bet it did wonders for sales of Queen music too - they created one hell of a repertoire.",8,2,3,9 January 2020
Judgment at Nuremberg," A truly evocative piece of cinema...
","Spencer Tracy is the presiding judge at the fictitious trial of some of the most evil Nazis to have survived the end of WWII. Chief amongst them is the formidable former jurist 'Dr. Ernst Janning' (Burt Lancaster). Richard Widmark is tasked with leading the prosecution; Maximilian Schell as their defender. Make no mistake, this is no standard courtroom melodrama. The performances from all - especially a sensitive and measured Tracy who tries, despite every sense of humanity within himself pulling him otherwise - to remain as impartial and fair in the face of the evidence of brutality presented to him and his fellow judges. There are a couple of wonderful cameo performances from victims of the alleged abuses - notably Judy Garland and Monty Clift with Marlene Dietrich as the widow of a former Nazi general who seems to be in some sort of a daze of denial (we are never quite certain what she did/didn't know). The story challenges the very basis of an independent judiciary and the principles of blind obedience motivated by pure evil, zeal or fear. The use, only once, of actual British footage from a liberated concentration camp is heart-rending and sickening in equal measure. A real must see.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
Dunkirk," A tale of horror and hope told from the ordinary 'Tommy' perspective.
","Faced with imminent annihilation, over 400,000 troops are stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk facing bombardment from superior Nazi air and land power. Christoper Nolan manages to condense into the next 95 minutes the grimness of the situation, and the sheer determination of the ordinary soldiers; how they deal with fear, learn to trust and co-operatate with others from many different nations - as the logistical nightmare that is repatriating them gradually is taking shape. We take the perspective of three individuals as they try to survive and get home and really do get a sense of the existential threat they each face; some more bravely than others. The events are historical fact, but the performances from Fionn Whitehead, Barry Keoghan are superb and perfectly plausible. A great supporting cast with Tom Hardy, Sir Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance amongst many all contributed to the authenticity of this expertly photographed (frequently using much more intimate POV-style coverage) production from Oscar nominated Hoyte Van Hoytema. The paucity of script also helped convince of the atrocity of their situation - definitely a case of less being more.",7,0,0,10 February 2020
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The battle lines are starting to be drawn...
","I recall the controversy as this was released. Alfonso Cuarón consciously decided to darken this film, and the light-hearted stories of the first two are replaced by an edgier approach to this tale for our wizarding trio. The world's most wanted wizard 'Sirius Black' (Gary Oldman) escapes from 'Azkaban' allegedly bent on the destruction of 'Harry'. The script has more by way of addition to the original book, but in a complementary - not detracting way. As the children grow into young adults, we are exposed to a scarier side of their existence - the 'Dementors' that are supposed to protect the innocent and the 'Boggart' all serve to introduce a physical fluidity to this shape-shifting environment of peril in which they now exist. The presence of 'Valdemort' becomes more omnipresent and there is so much more substance to the stories now. Michael Gambon takes over the role of Valdemort without quite the presence of Richard Harris, but we can tell now that this series is heading for murky, dangerous, waters...",8,1,1,26 February 2020
Aliens," A sequel to keep you enthralled...
","'Ripley' is rescued from her 57 year space nap by a salvage team. When she learns that the moon she only just escaped from was colonised - and that contact with it has been lost; she returns to investigate - this time with a much better trained and armed troop of colonial marines. Let battle commence! It is not quite as good as the first film - mainly because we are now too well acquainted with the dastardly aliens and so much of the shock factor has already been mitigated. That said, the special effects have clearly moved on significantly since 1979 and this is a cracking end-to-end sci fi thriller with plenty of action; some taut dialogue and both Michael Biehn ('Hicks') and Carrie Henn ('Newt') help Sigourney Weaver keep you glued to the edge of your seat.",7,0,1,29 March 2020
The Usual Suspects," Clever writing and intelligent acting in a classic crime thriller....
","A true masterpiece of the crime genre! Five usual suspects are rounded up by the police to take part in an identity parade following a New York heist. It's clear that they had nothing to do with it, but when pitched together decide that they will avenge themselves on the NYPD. Their scheme progresses well until the intervention of international super-criminal 'Keyser Söze' via his debonaire but menacing agent 'Mr. Kobayashi' (a superb Pete Posthlethwaite) and soon it becomes clear that the police are not the only people who are the targets here. It's told in a clever, retrospective, narrative style with some great performances from Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne that leaves us pondering just who is 'Söze' and to deal with an ending that you'll never forget!",8,1,1,22 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Adventure escapism at it's best....
","Picks up after the chaos of 'Infinity War' and tries to restore the equilibrium of the universe. This is great - Anthony Russo manages to adeptly corral some of the biggest A-listers around into a great couple of hours of entertainment. The sum of the whole is definitely greater than the parts - and they all look like they enjoyed putting the world to rights. Of course, it isn't at all cerebral, but that's not the point. This is spectacle cinema at it's finest (maybe Darth Vader is missing...) and if you're disappointed then you didn't read the label on the tin first.",8,0,2,26 November 2019
The Dirty Dozen," A bit over the top on the testosterone, but a fun action adventure...
","Lee Marvin is charged with a mission to drum a dozen criminals and reprobates into some sort of cohesive military unit with a view to destroying an heavily guarded chateau that serves as a respite for high ranking Nazi officers. The challenge looks impossible as the band are assembled - a bigger crowd of cowards, thugs and zealots you would never hope to see; but with the assistance of his stoic sergeant (Richard Jaeckel) he manages to get Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, Sonny Bono, Jim Brown and a woefully sleazy John Cassavetes to pull in the same direction. It's all good stuff, with plenty of humour to keep it all going nicely. Maybe a bit too long, but a good wartime action drama.",7,1,2,14 January 2020
Zulu," A battle for pride and honour - on both sides.
","A superb adventure tale about a British battalion charged with the defence of a mission station at Rorke's Drift from an army of Zulu who wish to remove the red devils from their lands. Stanley Baker plays Lt. Chard who takes command of this troop of engineers and has to plan and implement the defence of his ramshackle post whilst also combatting the superiority complex of Michael Caine's Lt. Bromhead who hails from a distinguished family of military and who, initially resents the leadership of this amateur, and from a drunken Jack Hawkins who's mission they are stranded in. John Prebble and Cy Endfield keep the script tight; and John Barry delivers a suitably grand score for this beautifully shot film.",8,0,0,8 December 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," The finest ingredients for a film I've ever encountered...
","This has got to be in my top ten movies - it is an almost flawless exercise in marrying fantastic photography, casting, writing, costumes and a score into three hours of wonderful entertainment. Rumour has it that Albert Finney was offered the lead role and suggested Peter O'Toole instead. If that is true (or not) then clearly serendipity was already on hand to guide this rendition of the story of TE Lawrence, who inspired and led an Arab uprising against the Ottoman empire. The iconic scene that introduces us to Omar Sharif as Lawrence heads to meet Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) starts us on a journey mixing adventure, politics, superstition, ambition and cruelty. Anthony Quinn is superb as are, in lesser capacities, Claude Rains, José Ferrer and Jack Hawkins as his somewhat cynical, but opportunistic GOC. Arthur Kennedy helps take Lawrence's story to the world and through his eyes we see how his character is changed by all the violence around/instigated by him. Peter O'Toole conveys the emotional rollercoaster of a journey from naive, optimistic officer to war-weary veteran in a dazzling fashion. This is a true treat of a film.",9,2,2,8 December 2019
The Elephant Man," A genuine 'must see'
","Saw this, recently up-converted to 4K at the London Film Festival and, apart from the clear improvements to the quality and detail of the image, I was reminded of just how good it is. Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft play their roles with engaging sincerity - very ably supported by Sir John Gielgud and Dame Wendy Hiller. Prosthetics aside, John Hurt captures both the despair and optimism of Merrick with empathetic style; and Freddie Jones is just downright evil as 'Bytes'. His son Toby was at the screening and I couldn't help but wonder when he watched this portrayal by his father whether the pride in the performance must have been tempered by a disgust in the character, itself!! This film doesn't seem to do the rounds very often, nowadays, but it holds up very well after almost 40 years and is really a gem.",8,1,1,15 November 2019
La Grande Illusion," Class isn't necessarily a birth thing....
","Very much more of a character-driven look at the experiences of French prisoners during the first world war. The inmates represent - much as did their army - soldiers from all aspects of life. The aristocratic Pierre Fresnay as 'Boeldieu', Jean Gabin 'Maréchal' and Marcel Dalio 'Rosenthal' as the more down to earth captives - but all proud Frenchmen with their own determination to escape their imprisonment. The film features many of their valiant escape attempts; along with providing us with quite an interesting illustration of the toughness of their existence and the diversions they sought from the terminal ennui. 'Boeldieu' forms an unlikely, respectful relationship with the Commandant - Erich von Stroheim; a fellow aristocrat who feels himself a failure for ending up as a glorified jailor rather than fighting gallantly on the battlefield. On a basic level, it is really quite routine; and the ending almost incidental: what makes this distinctive is the way the story interweaves the decline of a centuries old class system; the chivalric honour between opponents being a thing of the past. This is very much about 'Egalité' and 'Fraternité' in order to secure 'Liberté' and is told in as sympathetic a fashion as it is possible given the gritty peril of their circumstances. Gabin and von Stroheim are particularly effective as is Joseph Kosma's score and the tightly focussed direction on just a few central characters really does give this a sense of purpose.",7,0,0,15 May 2020
1917," A truly stunning tale of bravery above and beyond....
","I doesn't feel right reviewing a film of this stature when I watched it sitting in the comfort of an IMAX with a glass of Malbec in one hand and someone else's hand in my other... This depiction of the true horror of WWI really does get to the heart of the sacrifices made by ordinary, afraid, young men and lay them bare. I didn't find it particularly gory, or even scary for that matter, but Sam Mendes' direction, particularly of a wonderful George MacKay, but also of Dean-Charles Chapman is tender, taut and emotionally charged in a way that I haven't seen 'Saving Private Ryan'. The more established members of the cast - Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Scott feature sparingly, and do add value - but the film belongs undoubtedly to the two youngsters sent on an almost impossible mission across enemy lines to warn their comrades (one, being MacKay's brother) and save hundreds of lives. Thomas Newman's sensitive scoring and some magnificent cinematography from Roger Deakins make this an enormously engaging telling of courage, determination and loyalty. I'd sort of assumed 'the Joker' was unstoppable as the best film at the Oscars this year; I certainly don't think that now! It does need a big screen to do it justice; and is very much worth seeing.",8,7,10,18 January 2020
Mulholland Drive," Emperor's New Clothes...
","A woman involved in a car accident emerges with amnesia and with the help of a would-be starlet they try to get to the bottom of who did what to whom and why. Thereafter it twists and turns like an adder on steroids - but to what end? Sorry, but I just didn't get it. I'd ask what is it really about, but I am not sure I'd believe anyone who actually claimed to know. Is it really about anything tangible at all or is Lynch daring the audience to admit that they are too dense to grasp the 'creative concept' here? It is a well put together piece of cinema, and we do get good performances from Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux, but I just don't inhabit the parallel universe in which this is all set, and it was wasted on me.",4,1,3,9 January 2020
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Through a child's eyes - a gentle demonstration of human wickedness.
",Asa Butterfield ('Bruno') is the 8 year old son of a Nazi SS officer charged with commanding a European concentration camp. There he befriends a young Jewish inmate ('Schmuel') and slowly begins to challenge the indoctrination of the Nazis as they chat and play separated by a barbed wire fence. This most hideous of topics is handled subtly and delicately without avoiding the core horror and Nazi propaganda surrounding the holocaust and David Heyman has adapted John Boyne's book in a sympathetic and authentic way. There may well be factual inaccuracies but this is ultimately a story of compassion and a true 'coming of age' and works well in that space.,7,0,0,18 February 2020
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Way too much going on - should have been a two-parter?
","Possibly the weakest of the series, this one, for me. Our trio start by visiting the Quidditch World Cup which is invaded by the evil 'Death Eaters' who reduce everything to ashes in their search for 'Harry'. Shortly afterwards, the 'Tri-Wizard Cup' comes to Hogwarts - a good excuse to introduce some new characters amongst them Frances de la Tour as the enormous 'Madame Maxime' and Roger Lloyd-Pack as 'Barty Crouch' as each school chooses their champion to take part in the potentially lethal games. 'Hogwarts' chooses 'Cedric Diggory' (Robert Pattinson) but the goblet also chooses our 'Harry' and so four go into the competition. As this description, so far, probably indicates - there is an hell of a lot going on here and not surprisingly the adaptation to the screenplay starts to leave out detail and characterisation. To do the story justice, it ought to have been two films - we spend way too long establishing and when we get to the climax, it all seems a bit too rushed. Mike Newell simply has to squeeze too many, important, interweaving themes into 2Â½ hours and it doesn't quite work. It is still a great fantasy adventure building well on the now well-established characters and putting more meat on the bones of the 'Harry Potter' character.",7,0,0,26 February 2020
Psycho," No other word for this - it's just a classic...
","Janet Leigh is glorious as a put-upon secretary who decides - pretty much on the spur of the moment - to pinch rather a lot of cash from her employer and go on the run. She alights at a quiet roadside motel run by a slightly creepy Anthony Perkins and makes the terminal mistake of taking a shower. 'Det. Arbogast' (a doggedly determined Martin Balsam) is soon on her trail and Hitchcock now takes us on truly suspenseful ride in this superior thriller. Perkins is simply fantastic as the menacing, psychotic hotelier with 'mummy' issues; the direction is frenetic and yet steady - and Bernard Herrmann complements the whole thing with a superbly evocative score. The story is now the stuff of cinema legend, but each time I watch this, I seem to get something more.",8,0,0,25 February 2020
Joker," Brilliant, plain and simple....
","I've seen this film twice now at the IMAX, and it just gets better. Like everyone else I expect (as with Rami Malek last year) that Joaquin Phoenix will be a shoe-in for all of the major Best Actor awards (he is currently better than odds-on in the UK for both the BAFTA & the Oscar) and very deservedly so. His almost schizophrenic performance is both sensitive and brutal; haunting and terrifying in equal measure; the screenplay is engrossing and Todd Phillips keeps you captivated for a terrific two hours of cinema. Given current events in Hong Kong and, to a lesser extent, the activities of Extinction Revolution; the ending depicted here does not seem nearly as far-fetched as it ought to!! Super stuff!",8,1,3,24 November 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Emotional, exhilarating and horrific - a real 'man's inhumanity to man' story.
","If ever there was a film that combined magnificent cinematography, a memorable score and performances as much charged with mental as physical fortitude, then this has to be it. Right from the outset we get a true, deep, sensation of the atrocities carried out on prisoners of war by the Occupying Japanese forces as they are treated like little more than slaves building the Bangkok-Rangoon railway. Alec Guinness is wonderful as the stiff, principled CO determined to try and uphold some semblance of law and decency in the face of this oppression, as he leads his men on a 'strike'. Sessue Hayakawa portrays the ruthless camp commander 'Colonel Saito' in as close to an actually 'brutal' - both physical and psychological - way as I've ever seen anyone do on screen and the two men engage in the ultimate battle of wills. I found the William Holden storyline less engaging, though his mission, ultimately, helps us to focus on just how corrupted - both mentally and physically - Guinness has become in his determination to complete his task. David Lean's version of this Pierre Boulle novel is a truly timeless feat of cinema.",8,0,0,8 December 2019
The Last King of Scotland," Enthralling insight into the behaviour of a dictator.
","Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker takes on the what I can only imagine must have been the toughest task of his career, as he grittily portrays the charismatic Ugandan despot Idi Amin in this thriller told through the eyes of his personal physician (James McEvoy). Both performances work really well together and do evoke a real sense of the opulence and horror involved, viewed from inside Amin's coterie, as he turns from a benign dictator who does appear to want to improve to the lives of his people to a conceited tyrant who orders the torture of men and women alike with impunity. The extent to which the scenarios are actually true is moot, but as an history lesson it demonstrates inhumanity at it's most terrifying. The last 20 minutes make for a taut conclusion.",7,0,1,12 January 2020
The Lion King," 'I can't marry her... she's my friend...'
","Certainly not one of Disney's better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son 'Simba' born to the king 'Mufasa'; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend 'Nala' is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo 'Zazu'. One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother 'Scar' who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - 'Nala' discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it.",7,0,0,1 April 2020
Parasite," A film of two halves...
","I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie. The premiss that a family of grifters manage to infiltrate a pretty vacuous wealthy family by pretending to be, initially, a qualified English teacher, then an off-the-wall art teacher; a chauffeur and finally a housekeeper is original, funny and harmless. The humorous and mischievous way the family gel with their ambitions for a better life is a testament to the excellent performances from the four the principal characters. Regrettably, however, the second half descends quite rapidly into a farcical story that drags it down. Their harmless deception takes on a far more sinister - and implausible - guise as we quite literally discover (living) bodies under the stairs. It's now almost slapstick; ultimately violent and Bong Joon Ho now just seems to have lost his way. Yeo-jeong Jo is good, too, as the wealthy wife and I would heartily highly recommend this film, but it is - in my opinion - nowhere near as good as 'Mother'.",7,1,5,18 February 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," The ultimate cat-and-mouse thriller.... with a nice Chianti....
","This is a brilliant screen adaptation of the Thomas Harris book with a cast impossible to improve upon. Anthony Hopkins plays 'Hannibal Lecter', a murderous sophisticate with a penchant for eating the evidence and Jodie Foster as the novice FBI agent sent to try and elicit his help in tracking down a killer with a similar modus operandi to our now incarcerated Lecter. The menace with which Hopkins portrays the role is spine-chilling. Foster conveys the transformation from scared young agent to hard-nosed detective with convincing aplomb and this really does make for a belter of a thriller. A clean sweep of 5 Oscars and the top 2 acting BAFTA awards can't be wrong!",8,1,1,9 December 2019
Ben-Hur," Not without it's flaws, but a definite must-see.
","It will probably be remembered for it's chariot race long after all of the rest of it has faded away, but this is more than just that. It is a story about friendship, religion, power and opportunity - it is also about sheer bloody-mindedness and cruelty. It resonates all the more because these are all human traits that abound in all of us to some extent. The film looks truly amazing and Miklós Rósza is on top form with a score that encapsulates the Imperial grandeur of the Roman State in all of it's Tiberian pomp. The story, though, is a less impressive affair. Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd demonstrate how love can turn to hate splendidly when on screen together, the rest of the time neither performance really delivers much beyond the script. Jack Hawkins tries hard, but again doesn't quite hit the mark as the Consul. Hugh Griffith is a star as the mischievous, avaricious Sheik Ilderim and Sam Jaffe is also a good addition to this cast. It is way too long; after the chariot race it turns a little too much into the 'tale of the Christ' referred to by author General Lew Wallace at the very start and for me, somehow loses it's way. The battle scenes at sea are great and the sumptuous costumes, cinematography and sound all well deserving of their golden statuettes. A very good, but not quite great, cinema epic.",7,1,2,8 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A great film perfectly executed across the board...
","Now I am not a fan of children in films so approached this with more than a soupçon of trepidation. Well you can shoot me down in flames - Roman Griffin Davis is superb, simply superb. Can an 11 year old get an Oscar nomination? The story is quite surreal; a young Hitlerjugend (Nazi youth) discovers that his mother is harbouring a young Jewish girl under the eaves of their roof. What should he do? He's got Taika Waititi (aka Hitler) in his head preaching Nazi Arian philosophy at him whilst his own humanity (and curiosity) is guiding him elsewhere. Scarlett Johansson and the slightly sexually ambiguous pairing of Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen are great at keeping the whole thing going and it's funny and inventive from start to finish. Special mentions for Archie Yates as his pal 'Yorki' and Davis' acting coach Rachel House who has done a splendid job.",8,1,3,10 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Ok, so it's not brilliant - but I enjoyed it.
","Sometimes I wonder what folks wanted from these sequels. They were never, ever going to be as good as the first ones - but this is nowhere near as bad as the second set, either. There is no doubt that 'Kylo Ren' is about as scary as a custard but the rebel team of Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac (OK, BB-8 is annoying) do have a semblance of chemistry between them that works. JJ Abrams hasn't the imagination of George Lucas, but then nobody has... This is a fun, action adventure that trades on it's provenance for sure, but it is still enjoyable enough to watch with some good production values, SFX, action scenes and a decent enough script. It's fine.",7,3,17,9 February 2020
Rear Window," Always close your curtains.....
","Jimmy Stewart is cracking as the laid-up photographer who spends his chair-ridden days casually observing the day-to-day activities of his neighbours. Gradually, he becomes suspicious of one of them as the wife suddenly disappears and the husband (Raymond Burr) starts making odd trips out at night; calling long distance and generally acting oddly. Grace Kelly (his girlfriend) thinks this all a bit too prurient for her but is slowly drawn into his web of intrigue and ends up an active participant with his investigations as we now have a great conspiracy theory thriller. Thelma Ritter is great as 'Stella' as is Wendell Corey as 'Det. Doyle'. This is a tight, tense drama with a really cohesive cast under the skilful direction of the master of this genre.",8,1,1,25 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," As perfect a film as I've ever seen
","Thinking back to the films that define my generation; I recall queuing round the cinema as an excited 10 year old for two hours waiting to see this film. I wonder how many people could say that they have done that in the last 20 years? This film is a truly groundbreaking piece of formative cinema. Leaving aside the magnificent special effects; this is a film about good and evil; empire, freedom and democracy and of their true characterisations. It has a slightly stilted script (particularly from Sir Alec Guinness) but that is more than offset by a fabulous John Williams' score and the hugely engaging performances of Hamill, Fisher and Ford with undoubtedly the best baddie cinema has ever seen in 'Darth Vader'. Truly a wonderful watch.",9,1,2,17 December 2019
Ran," The Bard would be proud....
","This is one hell of an interpretation of William Shakespeare's 'King Lear' told in a magnificently vivid, colourful fashion with grand scale cinematography, costumes and matchless battle scenes. It's a well trodden story of a Lord who, rather rashly as it transpires, surrenders his wealth and power to his children on the assumption that he will visit each in turn - on a rolling basis - and continue to live a life of state and grandeur. Readers of the original play will be aware that this not so cunning plan proves to have more flaws than Donald Trump's plans for Domestos; and his initially supportive two sons (as opposed to 'Lear''s daughters) renege and leave the old man abandoned and homeless; dependent on his third son - whom he banished in a fit of fury when he originally told his father that his plan was daft. Kurosawa combines the rigid formality of Japanese ceremonial existence and familial deference with the raw emotions of betrayal, conceit and desperation magnificently. It's a long film - it'a a long play - but well worth the concentration required to appreciate a cleverly nuanced telling of a visceral story.",8,0,1,28 April 2020
Green Book," A indictment of shocking bigotry tinged with quite a lot of hope and optimism.
","I really enjoyed this story of racism and double-standards that tugged at the very hypocritical heart of 1960s America. An initially hostile Viggo Mortensen is assigned as guide and bodyguard to the hugely talented Don Shirley as he and his quartet tour the still racially divided US Southern states. Mahershala Ali is formidable as the creative, and somewhat aloof musician, who naively sets off on the enterprise not quite prepared for the reactions he is to get - at times he is viewed as little better than a performing seal and is treated accordingly by his 'hosts'. The score is superb and the writing and photography a delight. Was it the best film, though? I sometimes think that much like with 'Moonlight' and 'Call Me By Your Name' the Academy is genuflecting to the fact that Hollywood has been so far behind the curve in reflecting the changes in society, that it now feels compelled to pat itself on the back at every opportunity just for catching up with cinema from the rest of the world. This is certainly a better film than the the other two I just mentioned, but will it still be a topic of conversation in five years...?",8,0,1,10 December 2019
The Great Escape," It's lesson in 'human' history, not in history itself....
","Got to be the definition of an all star (albeit all male) cast in this gripping demonstration of just how inventive and ingenious people can be when incarcerated and facing a bleak (if any) future. Each character in this WWII POW drama brings something different to this ensemble of style and imagination. Richard Attenborough stars as the proverbial pain in the ass to his Nazi guards having repeatedly escaped before, and he puts together his 'X' organisation to work every scheme imaginable to get people out of this supposedly escape proof 'Super-Stalag '. Steve McQueen forms an unlikely alliance with Angus 'the Mole' Lennie; James 'the scrounge' Garner with the expert, tea-drinking, forger Donald Pleasance whose eyesight is failing rapidly; Charles Bronson and James Coburn and a whole raft of seasoned British actors bring this whole enterprise to life in a gritty, sometimes amusing, but ultimately determined way. Hannes Messemer 'The Kommandant' also deserves mention as he seems to still cling to some of the basic tenets of human decency as he tries to stop the Gestapo from implementing their more drastic solutions. Elmer Bernstein tops the whole thing off with a cracking score. It is long, certainly, but at least we can be certain we get out at the end...",8,0,0,8 December 2019
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," An eternal search for peace, bloody peace...
","This is a much more sophisticated take on the vampire through-the-ages narrative; but it has certainly dated in the almost 30 tears since Neil Jordan put together a stellar, if not great, cast to regale us with the tale of 'Louis' (Brad Pitt) & 'Lestat' (Tom Cruise). Told in flashback to a very sceptical reporter 'Daniel' (Christian Slater), Pitt tells of his near 200 year life that started with his meeting with Cruise and his conversion to his immortal existence based on blood. It's a hugely lavish affair, with loads of lust, trickery, duplicity and gore - tinged with genuine regret, loneliness and sadness - and, of course, loads of cruel violence. Whilst it does nod to the whole 'Hammer' style of horror thrillers - there is plenty of ketchup - the writing and characterisations have much more depth to them. Neither of the principal characters are likeable, but you do build some sort of reverse empathy with - at least Pitt - as the film progresses. The attention to detail on the sets and costumes as we march through time never lessens and contributes magnificently to a stylish, sumptuous glamour-fest. Much as they were/are doubtless box-office A listers, however, Pitt was just too young looking to be convincing, Cruise just can't really act at the best of times, much less with extra dental props and Kirsten Dunst just annoyed me in the best traditions of Shirley Temple. A shame, because the rest of this is superb.",7,0,0,12 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," '...and I thought they smelled bad on the outside!'
",This is a superb sequel. From the ice-planet adventures at the start; we explore the 'Jedi' philosophy more fully and learn more about Skywalker's demons during the time with 'Yoda' on Degobah and have the great duel at the end (that reminded me of the great fight at the end of 'The Raven' ). The established cast deliver well with new contributions from Billy Dee Williams all making this a great sci-fi adventure film.,9,0,0,17 December 2019
Aladdin," Thoroughly enjoyable musical adventure.
","Certainly one of the better animations from the reinvigorated 1990's Disney Studio. It still has the schmaltzy, over sentimental treatment that seems to torment me every time I watch a Disney film, but the characterisations of the 'Genie' (Robin Williams') and the evil 'Jafar' (Jonathan Freeman) are great as are the rest of the vocal acting talent (rather than using established stars). The script is punchy, well written and has plenty for folks of all ages to engage with. The songs are well paced and amusing and nowhere near as shouty as we have become used to in later animations. All in all this sits well as en enjoyable take on an an enjoyable Arabian Nights style story.",7,0,0,23 March 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Third time lucky - this is great!
","In my view, the best of the series by a country mile. Action-packed adventure cinema at the top of it's game. Harrison Ford and Alison Doody provide the foundations in an engaging and sexy way and allow Denholm Elliott; John Rhys-Davies and, of course, a series defining Sean Connery as 'Professor Henry Jones' with such a glint in his eye to add all the icing to a very, very good cake. John Williams provides a cracking score to complement the creativity of Messrs. Spielberg and Boam's words and images. What's not to like?",8,2,3,18 December 2019
Jurassic Park," Pioneering Cinema for the 20th century...
","A cracking film about a team of archaeologists sent to evaluate a theme park with a difference. It has end-to-end thrills and some truly groundbreaking special effects. The acting is, however, another matter entirely. Sam Neill and Laura Dean as well as the truly irritating children, deserve to be eaten (preferably as early on in the film as possible) and Richard Attenborough' s accent - well goodness only knows where that is supposed to come from. Bob Peck and Jeff Goldblum hold up their end of the bargain rather better and the dinosaurs are just magnificent. John Williams' does his stuff with the score, too - all contributing to something you must see.",8,0,0,5 December 2019
All the President's Men," A superb piece of cinema journalism...
","Based on the true, ground-breaking, investigations by the Washington Post into the seemingly innocuous break-in into the Watergate Building; this film produces two of the finest performances ever committed to film. Dustin Hoffman already had some grittier parts in his repertoire; but for Robert Redford this is more of a departure from his usual roles and the rapport between the two, initially suspicious journalists, builds as we all begin to realise that there is a hell of a lot more to this than just some unlucky burglars. Jason Robards and Martin Balsam serve as the real life editorial leads at the newspaper, but also as characters we can all use to take stock during these rapidly advancing, and incriminating developments. Alan J. Pakula subtly and deftly takes us through the chronology in an enthralling manner; exposing crossing sub-plots and personalities - as well as demonstrating the palpable risks being taken by many to uncover the truth. We all know the ending, but this film is quite possibly the reason why many still recall this momentous story.",8,0,0,29 March 2020
The Godfather," The definitive classic power drama...
","When you get a story written quite this magnificently it would take an extreme amateur to screw it up - and Francis Ford Coppola is no amateur. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious 'Corleone' family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother 'Fredo' too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
