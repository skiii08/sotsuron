The Blair Witch Project," One of the best movies I have ever seen
","*POSSIBLE SPOILER*I loved this movie because of it's originality. Never have I seen a movie presented as this one was. It might of been harder to watch on a big screen due to how it was filmed.I honestly was not all that scared but very much enjoyed the movie from beginning to end, however I found it hard to beleave at even at the end heather was still filming. That was the only bad thing I found about this film!",10,2,3,26 August 2002
