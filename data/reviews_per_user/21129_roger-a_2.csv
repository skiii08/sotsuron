Kill Bill: Vol. 2," much ado about nothing
","Quentin Tarantino writes dialogue that is empty yet very interesting. It was sadly lacking in KBVI and completely gone in Volume II. The opening scene in VII is his homage to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns - tight close ups and music by Ennio Morricone. But I don't call it homage. Its a straight rip off. And why? To what end?In this film I was on the edge of my seat... hoping someone on the big screen would say even one line remotely interesting. Nope. Not even the acting was interesting. Just some bits and pieces of many movies that have come before.But isn't that what Tarantino does best? Its hip hop. Its editing. Its sampling. Clever use of other people's ideas is by no means art. But it is so cool, isn't it?Candy will not sustain one's hunger. It only gives you a quick fix. QT does have talent but someone has to shake him and tell him that at some point he needs to take the craft of film making more seriously. It is as if he is too scared to actually try and say something - to try something original.How long did it take Spielberg to finally let go of all the tried and true conventions of his craft and try something serious (Schindler's List), not letting 'box office opening weekend grosses' mentality be the bottom line?My respect for both QT and UT have dropped but what do they care? In ego land cash is king.I guess for many, success is the worst thing that can happen to you.",4,6,11,19 April 2004
The Love Guru," Not very good... and i really enjoyed it.
","Movies are rather personal, aren't they? Enjoying this one helps if you are a Leafs fan and of Mike Myers and Deepak Chopra. I am on all three accounts.I played hockey with nice guy, Mike, while I was in L.A. in 2000. Since then my daughter (who was five in 2000) have gotten hooked on his Austin Powers films.We both walked out of the theatre after viewing Guru and said, 'It wasn't very good and I really liked it.' The spiritual ideas are sound but it's his joy of life that comes through. Like that of Deepak Chopra.Yes, the pooh-pooh jokes are sometimes old, sometimes gross but for those that are used to it, they don't deter.Compare the joyous nature of Mike's character in this film (which truly is 'his') and that of Cat in the Hat. How can you go wrong with Dr. Suess? But Cat falls flat.This is not a hit for the masses. Screw that! I hope he continues to make 'his' films, his way.",7,4,9,20 October 2008
