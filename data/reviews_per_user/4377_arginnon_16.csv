The Avengers," Is The Avengers really that good? It is.
","I knew this movie was going to be good, but I thought 96% on RottenTomatoes and 8.9 on IMDb was a little too much for a movie like this. Oh boy how wrong I was. This film was not good, it was EPIC! With all caps and an exclamation mark.We have all our favorite heroes in a single movie, played by some great actors, driven by over the top special effects and co-ordinated by a skillful director, who also rocks with the dialogs. I think it took a great deal of pre-production and in-production work by Joss Wheedon to make these unique characters work well in a single film and he did a terrific job in keeping together all these amazing actors.There was no dull moment in this film. It was very well paced, wonderfully done and greatly enjoyed. The first half consisted of getting all the heroes together, introducing the plot and the characters, but it was done with such finesse, that I didn't even realize how long this part took. The film was very entertaining throughout, with hilarious comic reliefs, exciting action and wonderful score by Alan Silvestri.I loved when all of the Avengers were together and just talked, because the awesome script really showed their character and why they're not really good as a team. But they finally got on with each other and the final battle commenced - the most epic final battle after, of course, Lord of the Rings. There's a shot in this scene, which just blew my mind. It was a single shot, with no cuts at all, showing all the characters fighting the alien hordes and it was just fantastic.I first felt sad, when I heard Edward Norton won't be reprising his role as Bruce Banner, but as soon as Mark Ruffalo appeared on screen, I thought: 'Way better than Ed Norton.' They made a great choice in casting him, he was much more convincing and less greedy. Norton may be angry with himself, but he won't turn green anymore.What Joss Wheedon did really well is that he deepened all the supporting characters we've seen in the other films. We learned a lot about Black Widow, about Hawkeye and even about Agent Coulson. The writer is really great with all the different characters, because it feels like we're watching people who could very well exist, not just superhero cardboard cut-outs. Most films like this - ahem Superman ahem - only have that.I can honestly say I loved The Avengers, I don't care if it's too mainstream. The superhero movies are my favorite sub-genre! I recommend it to all, watch it, love it, enjoy it. I can't wait for more.",10,2,6,4 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Lives up to its predecessors
","I am a big Pirates of the Caribbean fan, so I'm kind of ashamed of myself for seeing it so late after the release. I didn't know what to think of this movie before I went to see it, because some people loved it, yet some hated it: so I had to check it out for myself. I did do that and I went into the cinema with no expectations what so ever, so I was not disappointed. Wasn't disappointed? I loved the film!It was very entertaining, the writers did a great job. Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing as usual and Geoffrey Rush played well too. Ian McShane was kind of a weak villain, and the movie took a little bit too much time to start (the first half is very slow, with unnecessary sword fights), but for the second half Rob Marshall finally finds himself and continues the film in a good pace and rhythm. I don't think Marshall is a better or worse director than Gore Verbinski, the change of directors freshened up the franchise a bit. I didn't mind the priest- mermaid love story in the film either, I think it was a good added spice.I wouldn't go as far as to say this film was the best in the series, but it was by far the most entertaining and it lived up to the first one. Thanks to Hans Zimmer's breath-taking music, Johnny Depp's performance and the hilarious character of Jack Sparrow, this franchise will never get old for me.",7,0,1,4 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Josh Brolin is the best
","The first Men in Black movie I saw was the second one. It didn't really impress me, so I didn't rush to see the first one. But as part III was approaching I thought I should check it out and I was surprised, I liked it very much, but I still didn't go into the cinema with hight hopes, but again I had to realize that I was wrong. The movie's not a masterpiece, it won't change your life, but it's fun, and that's what counts. The story was good (I always like good time-travel in films), the action and the effects worked, Will Smith was funny as ever, but Josh Brolin's Tommy Lee Jones impression was the best.The interactions between J and K were well written and Jemaine Clement did a terrific job as the villain. But sometimes I found the alien elements to be too much. Boris's hand and those spikes he shot out of it were kind of ridiculous, and his motives weren't very clear, but that doesn't take much away from the experience. Also there were some plot-holes and things that weren't explained, but I guess time-travel is hard to write, because it doesn't exist. I don't want to pick this movie apart, so I won't talk about these illogicalities, see them for yourself.All in all the movie isn't the best, but it isn't bad at all. Enjoyable, funny and brings back nice memories. Oh and the music was really good too (Danny Elfman did the composing).Score: ★★★★",7,1,4,31 May 2012
Sucker Punch," No story, but hot chicks and great visuals
","First of all I have to say that I liked the movie. The story was too flat, and too desperate in trying not to be flat. The moral of it felt forced to me, and the multiple layers of reality made it look like a crappy version of Inception. Yet the fight scenes were incredibly well done, and the visuals were very impressive as well.The story is kind of stupid. A girl (Baby-Doll) is moved to a mental hospital because she kills her sister instead of her abusive stepfather. There she imagines that she is in this whorehouse and she has to dance for the High Roller. Whenever she dances her mind takes her to these fantastical worlds where she has to find these four objects to escape from the asylum. It's too complicated, it would've been a whole lot better if the story was only in the fantasy world. This 'the whole thing is just in your head' crap wasn't needed.The action sequences in this film were absolutely remarkable. The WWI fight scene with the bombed Notre-Dame and the steam-powered German zombie soldiers was amazing. These fantasy worlds Zack Snyder created were fantastic, he just should've executed his whole story in them, reducing the layers of reality to one. He is one of the best action directors, but he shouldn't be writing his own scripts.All in all, Sucker Punch isn't a good movie, but it is well made and quite enjoyable in some parts.",6,2,4,4 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Pretty good, but could've been better.
","May the odds be ever in your favor!The Hunger Games is a really good film, and I can only imagine how good the books must be (I gotta read them some time!). The world of the film fascinated me, the story was great, the characters as well, especially because of the great actors portraying them. Good special effects, OK action and good times at the movies.What I hated though, was the cinematography. The hand-held camera, the shaky-cam irritated me so much, I couldn't enjoy many parts of the film because of it. The fast-paced editing didn't help either! Sometimes things got so confusing, I couldn't tell what was going on on the screen. And the camera never stopped! It would've been great to let our eyes have some rest between poorly coordinated action scenes, but the darn camera just kept on moving! This has to stop. This style of shooting isn't good. Stop it. Please.Other than this unfortunate error, I enjoyed the movie. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how good the adaptation was, but I think the screenwriter(s) did a terrific job. There were a couple things I didn't like about the story though: the ending, which I found predictable, and someone's death, which I think was overemphasized. The love story seemed forced to me too, but maybe it was better written in the book. I also missed the twists. All the major plot points were in the trailer, so there weren't any surprises. I loved Stanley Tucci in the film and Jennifer Lawrence was a perfect action star.Another thing I didn't like was the PG-13 rating. Some scenes could've been so awesome, but the editors took away the sound, added some heart-braking music to the shakily shot scenes, making them hard to enjoy. The film could've had so much potential if the studio didn't want to stick to the lower rating. Blood and gore is fun! Especially when the theme of the movie is so brutal. People expect to see more, than just quick, shaky images that only imply the action, rather than show it.",7,3,8,4 May 2012
127 Hours," No Oscar win? Shame on them.
","This movie was simply amazing! James Franco's performance is shockingly natural, hilarious and even scary at some points. The film tells the true story of a man, Aron who is stuck in a canyon with one bottle of water for over five days, without telling anyone where he went. Judging by the plot, the film could've sucked, could've been average, but it was over the top.Danny Boyle showed us many times before that he is a genius, now he has proved it. All the shots are spectacular, the way of storytelling is interesting and the film is amusing, exciting and moving. It shows the suffering of Aron in a very naturalistic way, you feel the same way he does. I don't recommend this film for those, who can't take much, but it is truly a masterpiece.Don't get me wrong, I loved The King's Speech too (it truly deserved to win the Oscar), but this film somehow had a greater impression on me.",9,1,2,4 May 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Spielberg+Jackson=Epic
","As a fan of Hergé's comic book series, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and Andy Serkis, this film was a must see for me. And I wasn't disappointed! It was fun, action packed, enjoyable, well made and had a great score by John Williams.The story's basically a bunch of Tintin comics merged in one epic adventure, but it's mostly based on 'The Secret of the Unicorn' (and possibly the sequel will be 'The Treasure of Red Rackham!) and it has some great little treats for the fan-boys. The motion capture technology really delivered, the characters looked amazing, halfway into the movie I even forgot I was watching animation.Andy Serkis did a really good job, I loved him as Captain Haddock, who was my favorite character in the comics too. The storyline was great, lot of funny scenes and lines, I had a great time at the movies. I recommend it to those who are familiar with Hergé's series or are fans of Spielberg and Indiana Jones or just great action-adventure movies in general.",9,3,4,4 May 2012
Hugo," 3D or not, a great movie!
","So I decided to go and check out Hugo. For its Oscar nomination and wins, of course, because I'm not very fond of 3D family movies. As it turns out, Martin Scorsese is still Martin Scorsese, even when it comes to directing non-gangster films. He is famous for his movies like Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed, which are the cream of gangster flicks and I understand Scorsese for wanting to try something new. It's not a good thing to be trapped in a genre. Just ask Michael Bay. First I didn't like the idea of 3D Scorsese film, especially a family film, but oh boy, was I wrong.The film reminded me, why I fell in love with movies in the first place. The magic of cinema lingers all around this title, thanks to the amazing skills of Martin Scorsese. Mystery, lovable characters, interesting settings and excitement.I haven't read the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, so I can't compare the movie to that, but I gotta say Hugo is worthy of all its Oscars (best cinematography, best art direction, best sound design and best sound editing), except one: best special effects. That should've went to Harry Potter, hands down. I mean what's so special about some flying papers? The dream- train scene was very well done, but it's nothing more than we already saw in Inception.The directing is stunning and the cinematography (especially in eye-popping 3D) is spectacular. The story sometimes gets slow, although it's entertaining throughout, the delightful performances of all the actors spice up the film, it's inspirational, it's wonderfully done, charming and touching. Though if the story doesn't grab you, you can always entertain yourself with the amazing visuals, the lovely music and the fantastic directing.I recommend this film to all, all ages will like it, except, maybe, rebellious teens.",9,3,6,4 May 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," Almost as good as X-Men. Almost.
","I'm not a huge X-Men fan, I didn't read the comics, but I've seen all of the films now. This is definitely not the best one, but a rather fun movie to check out. Magneto is cool, Wolverine is bad-ass and Vinnie Jones makes a hilarious Juggernaut. The movie is worth watching only for his awesome line: 'I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!' It's just legendary.The plot revolves around a cure what was invented to rid mutants of their abilities. Magneto doesn't want that, so he forms an army of mutants to destroy the source of the cure. The X- Men need to stop him, but I'm not gonna tell you if they succeed or not.I saw some familiar faces in the film, like Dania Ramirez, Ellen Page, Shohreh Aghdashloo and of course Stan Lee at the beginning. I didn't expect to see them, so it was a good surprise.The special effects, costumes were really good in the film, the story was a little weak and the acting was fairly average too. It had some good fight scenes, cool new abilities and Wolverine, who is Marvel's Batman.The film is worth checking out, if you're down to comic book adaptations.",5,3,4,4 May 2012
Clash of the Titans," I really loved the music. Made the film a whole lot better.
","I know I missed like the first five minutes of the film, but could anyone tell me where the hell are the Titans in this film? I mean they're in the damn title!Apart from this obvious and annoying error, I enjoyed the film. I don't say it was the best, or something that can be watched many times, but it's good fun. Great action, even better music and some great actors posing as gods. Sam Worthington is a good action star, Gemma Arterton isn't a bad sight and the special effects were over the top.Now that I listed the good things, let's move on to the bad ones: the story is lame. Furthermore, it sucks. But if you just watch the bright pictures, and listen to the sounds, you might as well enjoy this movie. When I watch a film, I tend to focus on the good things, and that is why I liked this one. I ignored the sloppy writing and let myself flow with the random action.It's obviously nothing like 300, but it's definitely less boring then Troy. If you like these kind of movies I'd recommend it, but it doesn't worth your money. If it's in TV you should check it out.'Slow zoom on the desert, there's flags evil guy-CUT!' – if you know what this is, you're cool.",5,0,1,4 May 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Unexpectedly well done
","This film surprised me. I was expecting something completely different, but it was a good surprise. The thing I instantly noticed was the truly remarkable photography. The film was beautifully shot, the amazing John Toll did a superb job. He is a great cinematographer and absolutely deserved his two previous Oscar's and needs to win another if not more. The editing and the music also stood out.The story was very interesting, and I liked the way it was done too. I haven't read the original short story, but I think the script was rather good. The actors also did a good job, I especially liked Terence Stamp. Oh, and Anthony Mackie surprised me with his appearance, I didn't expect to see him. Matt Damon was good too, but Emily Blunt played him off I think.The story is not the of the simple kind which I am used to when watching American movies nowadays. A troubled, but popular New York state representative, David Norris (Matt Damon) meets the woman of his dreams, Elise (Emily Blunt) in the men's room. Their ways depart, and David doesn't even know her name. A few months later they meet on a bus. Elise gives David her phone number. It turns out that some people, very important people don't want them to be together.I liked the film, but it wasn't the greatest.",9,1,1,4 May 2012
The Artist," The best thing in 3D times
","In a world where movies are converted to 3D just because this is the new trend, where we hardly see any hand-drawn animation, where acclaimed directors start using 3D, a black-and-white, silent (2D) movie really stands out. I can only imagine how Martin Scorsese must've felt at the Oscars.The Artist is a wonderful film, highly emotional, funny a lot of times, enjoyable and technically well done. It is definitely worth watching: amazing performances, great story, stunning visuals and magical music. The fact that the movie is silent, makes it even better, because sounds and silences have a way deeper meaning this way. (You can't really eat popcorn to this film, though. Everyone will hear your crunching.)It is a very good thing that The Artist was able to win the Oscars, it's just kind of sad that it failed at the box office.",10,2,4,4 May 2012
Thor," The sons of Odin strike
","Thor is a fun, action packed ride, which guides you through this fabulous, Norse myth era of MARVEL comics, hosted by none other, then the one and only Kenneth Branagh. Although we can all agree, that he is a better actor than director, he did a very good job in bringing the script adapted from the comics to life. The best thing about this film is the score. Patrick Doyle is a great musician and he did a marvelous job in scoring Thor. The visuals are stunning, and the cinematography is good too. The actors did their job well, and I have to say, that Chris Hemsworth proved to be the best of the cast.Now that I listed all the good things, we shall move onto the bad ones: the story is simple and doesn't really hold together, it's like of a not-too-good video game. Frost giants battle the vikings of Asgard, and Odin's son, Thor is banished from the Kingdom, because he was disrespectful with his father (he called him an 'Old man and a fool!'). The Asgardians use this teleport-thing to transport Thor to the Earth where Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard and a second chick hit him with their truck, while admiring a weird storm (it came from the teleport-thing, actually). The second chick is annoying, Skarsgard's character doesn't really have a purpose in the film, he's just there all the time, and the three viking friends of Thor don't really serve a purpose either, they only fight a little. Although I have to admit, the relationship between Thor and Loki is very well written.I liked that Agent Coulson was in this movie too, and there was a surprising cameo in the film, which I won't ruin for you. All in all, Thor is worth checking out for MARVEL fans, and comic book lovers, because it's a pretty decent adaptation. Not as good as Iron Man though, but it beats the crap out of all the Spidey movies.",6,1,2,4 May 2012
X-Men: First Class," Not the best comic book movie, but certainly one of them.
","I saw this movie a little while back, but I didn't get around reviewing it. But it's better late, than never, so here it is: I think First Class is the best X-Men movie yet. I read in a lot of reviews that it's the 'BEST COMIC MOVIE EVAR!!!1!!1!!one!!!!!!', but it is not as good as The Dark Knight or Iron Man, although it is a very good film. Despite the fact that there are a few differences in this film to the other X-Men movies, this one was, by far, the best. Matthew Vaughn has never made a bad movie yet, so why'd he make a bad X-Men movie?Michael Fassbender was the best choice for young Magneto. He did a great job in portraying the soon to be greatest villain of all time (according to the list on IGN). James McAvoy was a good professor X too, but I just wasn't convinced that he was the same old guy we saw in X- Men, X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand. The villain in this film, Sebastian Shaw (played by Kevin Bacon) was also very good, but not as good as Magneto, of course. The other members of the cast were good as well, but I have one aching question: why did the black guy have to die after like ten minutes of screen time?The story was well written, but there were some plot-holes if we consider the previous films. Matthew Vaughn was a great choice as the director, he did a very good job. Another thing that I have to mention is the music. It was mind-blowingly amazing!If you like comic book adaptations this movie is a must see. If you don't like them, then it's possible that you'll like this one.",9,0,1,4 May 2012
Iron Man," Great fun!
","Iron Man is the Batman Begins of the Marvel universe. It shows the origins of a great superhero, done by a very good director, a fantastic actor in the title role and pretty good writers. I loved the part, when Tony Stark was in the cave building the MK I armor and then escaping with it, I also enjoyed the stuck-up character of Stark and the way Robert Downey Jr. portrayed him. I don't know if Tony had the electro-magnet in his chest in the comics as well, but I really liked the idea.This movie is the first that leads up to The Avengers and at that it's great, because, unlike Captain America, it totally stands on its own and it doesn't keep reminding you that it's a prequel, other than the obvious post-credits scene. On the other hand, I don't know which one was first, but Iron Man kept reminding me of Batman. A lot. Tony Stark is a rich playboy, Bruce Wayne as well. They both live through a tragic experience and thus decide to become superheroes. With their money and brain they create their suit and ultra high-tech gadgets to fight terrorism/crime. Pepper Potts+J.A.R.V.I.S.=Alfred Pennyworth, Rhodey=Robin+Gordon. Just sayin'.The movie is highly enjoyable, a great fun, packed with action and also some laughs. Ramin Djawadi (one of my favorite composers) did a fantastic job in scoring, Jon Favreau's directing was great and JEFF BRIDGES! was a kick-ass super-villain. I recommend it to anyone who likes superheroes, but those too, who just love an entertaining action movie. Maybe they'll learn to like them.",9,0,2,4 May 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Potter for ever
","This film is absolutely brilliant. The makers of the Harry Potter franchise finally pulled themselves together, and made something awesome. I am a huge fan of the books, but I haven't been a real fan of the films, because they've been constantly disappointing me. I've read all the books at least five times, so I now them almost word for word, so maybe that's why the other films (especially the fourth one) were such disappointments for me. But this one, the eighth film in the series, was everything I could hope for.It was true to the book, the visuals were striking, the acting was over the top, the music was moving and the script was (finally) well-adapted. Maybe all these things are due to the fact that J. K. Rowling was an executive producer on this. I liked that there were some funny moments and some extra action in the movie which weren't in the book, but I missed one thing they left out. I won't tell you what it is, because I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet (shame on you! go see it).I'm glad John Williams didn't come back for this film to compose, Alexandre Desplat's music is so full of emotions and has great tunes. I actually cried at one scene (because of the music and Alan Rickman's great acting), although films don't usually have that effect on me anymore.All in all the film was great fun, in some way better than the book, so for a Potter fan it's a must see.",4,2,4,4 May 2012
