Vertigo," Deserves the high rating.
","'Vertigo' was much better than I expected. I was given a box set of Hitchcock's masterpiece films and this is one of the last ones I got around to watching.A friend of mine told me it was rather boring and that one of the only redeeming qualities about it was the famous 'vertigo camera shot.' I hardly noticed that shot, but I did notice and amazing story that keeps your eyes glued to the screen, superb acting, an awesome score and an ending that leaves you breathless. I was scared of that figure. It really freaked me out.'Vertigo' is a must see! Hitchcock did it again. 9 out of 10, kids.",9,3,7,2 October 2008
Come and See," INSANELY ahead of its time and brilliantly done.
","The reviews are right, this one is amazing. I was shocked at how well it is done.Effectively portraying the Nazis for what they are and were, 'Come And See' pits an innocent young boy against an animal movement that destroys his village, his entire family and his life for no real reason. He and his 'compatriots,' mostly farmers and other kids, try to do what they can against the invaders. He witnesses brutality and savagery at the hands of the Nazis in a swirl of confusion and exhaustion that is seemingly endless.Not for the faint of heart, this one, like 'Schindler's List' and 'The Pianist' should go down as a World War Two film that must be seen to be believed. It is not funny or fun or light-hearted at all. It does not make a mockery of tragedy, nor does it glorify or simplify the actions of the SS; it paints a vivid portrait of destruction and death that becomes one boy's reality in the midst of what seems like a nightmare. The effect on the viewer is incredible and that makes this an important piece of film-making. It stuck with me for weeks and I will never forget seeing 'Come and See.'The fact that the budget was probably minuscule in comparison to other films of this emotional magnitude says a great deal about the folks involved in the project. Plus the fact that it was made in 1985! Wow. A solid 10 out of 10, kids. See it.",10,3,3,9 September 2009
Scarface," The best DePalma ever did.
","Along with 'Dressed to Kill,' this is DePalma's masterpiece. Whereas 'Dressed to Kill' is a brilliant mix between early Argento and Hitchcock, I think 'Scarface' is a nice combination of the 1970's Italian crime exploitation flicks, (like those of Castellari,) and a brutal Sergio Martino slasher. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, check those guys out!) Violent as the day is long and filled with something to offend almost anyone, it is no wonder that 'Scarface' has made such a mark on pop culture. It is appealing to almost anyone. Those who criticize Pacino's over-the-top portrayal of a Cuban guy need to get a grip; it was meant to be that way and anything less would not have been as entertaining. He becomes a caricature of himself and it really works. I mean, there are action figures made of the guy and I wouldn't even call this an action movie.The music, the acting, the direction and the flow of the story are masterful and history will prove that 'Scarface' is one that will go down as a classic because it is one kickass movie, no doubt.9 out of 10, kids.",9,1,2,3 May 2009
Casablanca," Not bad.
","I have to say 'Casablanca' is a bit overrated. While displaying technical genius on many levels, the film has not aged too well. Maybe it blends in with other films of the era. It was entertaining, but I'd say pales in comparison to other classics from the golden age like 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,' and 'The Maltese Falcon.' Unlike those two, 'Casablanca' fails to deliver any deep message. There is no moral and there is nothing terribly memorable about the film. Well actually, there is Bogart...Without him, I think 'Casablanca' would have been pretty dull and forgettable. It just didn't grab the way I hoped it would.This all being said, the story is fun, the humor is ripe, and the acting is superb. Technically speaking, a nine. Entertainment-wise, I'd say a six. I'll average it and be generous since it is, after all, 'the best Hollywood film ever made...' cough cough.7 out of 10, kids.",7,0,6,17 April 2008
I'm Not There," HILARIOUS, incoherent, pretentious, big-budget garbage.
","Well, I saw two terrible movies in the past week. One of them was 'Troll 2' on the IMDb Bottom 100, and the other was this 'I'm Not There' thing. I won't even call it a film because it isn't one. It's more like one long MTV music video. Yup, I enjoyed 'Troll 2' a hell of a lot more. Yes, the verdict is in and the hype is over. This one is a grandiose turd.Where do I begin? I own 18 Bob Dylan albums. I play the guitar and sing and I learned to play by learning Dylan songs. I think he is the most amazing talent in music in my lifetime bar none. I own 'Don't Look Back' and 'The Other Side of the Mirror.' I also love 'The Last Waltz.' I can hardly begin to describe how awful 'I'm Not There' is. We have a young black kid named Woody Guthrie who plays the guitar and sings, he obviously is supposed to represent young Bob. Then there is Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, and the god awful Cate Blanchett. They all are supposed to represent different sides of Dylan, but none of them are named Bob Dylan. It is all so phony and poorly done that it made my head spin. Blanchett's impersonation of Dylan was just that, something like Frank Caliendo doing Al Pacino. Laughable! The icing on the cake was how we spend almost an hour basically re-enacting the amazing documentary 'Don't Look Back' but with Blanchett hamming it up the entire time, reciting lines that Dylan said in 'Don't Look Back' and just being generally weird. I was horrified! The worst thing about this film is that it attempts to disguise itself as this 'independent artsy, gritty film' but it is just more of the same Weinstein Company run of the mill trash that keeps churning out of that disgusting machine and this time they managed to ruin an amazing artist in the process for many young people. I hope they rot in hell for that.The only redeeming thing about 'I'm Not There' was the only thing that is truly Bob Dylan and that was the soundtrack.A real fan of Bob Dylan will HATE this 'film.' 1 out of 10, kids.",1,10,21,2 December 2008
The Big Lebowski," Charming and outlandish drama.
","I've seen this movie about 15 times. To say that it is 'hilarious' is pushing it a bit. I think it has it's moments; funny it is, but 'Groundhog Day' it ain't...To say that it is the greatest movie ever made: now THAT is hilarious!'The Big Lebowski' is the pothead/college clever guy/film student anthem that always seems to find it's way on DVD into every one of the aforementioned's film collections.The amazingly talented Jeff Bridges portrays a dude named, well, The Dude, who shares the same last name as a crippled millionaire who is involved with some shady characters. The Dude suffers for this, but he and his sidekick, 'Nam Vet Walter, manage to come out looking like two diamonds in the rough amongst a host of wealthier, shallower individuals.Not without some awesome lines and scenes, 'The Big Lebowski' stumbles through 'a few weeks in the life of' The Dude in his adventure. By the end, we are satisfied and we basically learn that people who bowl in bowling alleys, sleep in low-rent apartments and drink White Russians all day are people too. And sometimes they are better than the wealthy and the elite.Only problem is, if you didn't already know that, what you need to do is drop out of college, stop having mommy and daddy pay your bills and join the real world. This movie alone won't save you.As a cowboy shooting down home wisdom from the hip, Sam Elliott's character is by far my favorite part of the film. 7 out of 10, kids.",7,0,2,2 November 2008
Memento," Not plausible, but fun.
","'Memento' is a sleaze-ball suspense movie with a twist. As if you don't know it yet, the scenes are played all jumbled and out of order.What could have turned into just a nasty trick on the viewer is actually very well-done here. You see things from the perspective of our main character who suffers from a bizarre memory loss condition. Rather than explain the plot, I will just say that if you plan on watching this movie just once, get ready to change your plans. You will need to watch it twice to fully GET it. It moves too fast for the viewer and by the time it's over you will tell yourself that you GET it, but you don't.To those who say there are no holes in this film I scoff at you. Why does Leonard have no memory loss in the murder sequence? He remembers long enough to drive all the way to that abandoned building and then wait for the murderer. In other scenes, he forgets what he is doing after two minutes. Maybe he is just psychotic and made the whole condition up in his mind to excuse a rampage? The hypotheses are endless. Personally, I'd rather watch a movie that just makes sense on it's own and no matter what you say, this one doesn't. 'Memento' tries to do what 'Pulp Fiction' did but takes itself way too seriously. The viewers are treated to a narrative from the character Teddy at the end when he has to explain the situation to Leonard thus explaining the movie to us. Kind of cheap, Nolan.One thing is for sure: Guy Pearce is one of the best actors alive.7 out of 10, kids.",7,17,25,2 November 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Top 250!? Are you kidding me???????
","'Inglourious Basterds,' a title which is stolen from a superior Italian trash flick by Enzo Castellari, is pure pretentious drivel.The opening scene of the movie is the only one which can compare to films from the glory days of Quentin Tarantino. The rest of the movie just descends down a long and boring hill and putters to a stop. It never builds any kind of strong characters. We are given a glimpse into ONE of the 'basterds' past but none of the others. It's like Tarantino said every few days of shooting: 'You know what would be freakin' kewl? If we did ....this....' It's all a jumbled mess with no theme even. It bounces from Spaghetti Western, to Italian Exploitation to Eastern martial arts and back around again. I got lost in the 'coolness' of it all.Brad Pitt who I happen to think is a fine actor, fell way short in this. His little southern accent gimmick wears off after about 10 minutes and his character just seems comical. And Eli Roth as 'the bear jew ?' What the heck is that!?This Tarantino guy just happens to be the ONLY film maker in Hollywood that is brash enough to steal from the masters (Leone, Fulci, Castellari, Argento, etc) and doesn't mind adding a dash of modern Hollywood lameness to it. It's ashame Americans are dumb enough to fall for it and we don't seem to have room in our hearts for more creativity in films these days.A total example of style over substance. It will not stand the test of time. I'll stick with the originals. Blue Underground releases a good handful every year! This is not a good movie. 2 out of 10, kids.",2,33,63,27 January 2010
Dawn of the Dead," Loses points because of the name.
","2004's remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' is a classic example of a decent film that is hindered by being another in a long line of horror remakes.While not technically bad, one has to wonder: wouldn't it have been easier to omit a few technicalities from the script and plot and create a fresh, new zombie movie for us? While it did have similarities to the superior 1978 classic, it didn't have THAT much in common where a few things couldn't have been changed to create something original.Ving Rhames adequately portrays the bad ass while Sarah Polley is also great in the lead female role. The zombies move fast ALA 'Nightmare City' and are genuinely scary in some parts.I really wanted to like this film except that it is called 'Dawn of the Dead.' This is not 'Dawn of the Dead,' there is only one and it was directed by George Romero in 1978. After viewing, I felt like I did after I watched the awful 'Day of the Dead 2: Contagium.' I kept asking myself WHY WHY WHY? Get original, Hollywood. You obviously have the talent; is it really that hard to develop a new screenplay??? 5 out of 10, kids.",5,0,1,11 January 2009
Oldboy," Absolutely authentic and 100% bad ass.
","The first time I saw 'Oldboy' I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping, it grabs and never lets you go.It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost clichÃ©. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of 'Oldboy' are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end, you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like 'Oldboy' is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cutting-edge stuff. But it's also nice to know that someone out there still has the guts to do a film with no barriers that makes you stand up and flip off guys like Tarantino and go, 'that's what I'm talking about.' 10 out of 10, kids.",10,47,81,20 February 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," An outsider's perspective.
","Being mostly a viewer of Italian horror films and vintage American slashers, I went into 'Pan's Labyrinth' not knowing what to expect really. I'd heard it was a really great film with some pretty deep themes, but for the most part it was kind of an adult fairy tale.I have to admit, I was pretty shocked by how graphic this film was. I'm a big gore fan, but this one had emotional shock to it that was a little tough to watch. A man sees his son's face smashed by a cruel military captain, a woman witnesses her own brother being tortured. It is basically a fable with a healthy dose of torture porn. Not unlike 'Hostel.' The acting is outstanding, no doubt. The special effects are really awesome too. I was impressed with the creatures and the monsters. It reminded me of books I read when I was a kid that scared me. I liked that part of it. I liked the ending a lot too, but what was the message really? Always follow your heart, I suppose...never stop believing in magic maybe? All in all, it was more shocking than anything else. I turned to my friend and girlfriend when it was over and all three of us were like: 'wow, that was messed up.' If that's what you're looking for, check out 'Pan's Labyrinth.' 6 out of 10, kids.",6,0,6,9 February 2008
28 Weeks Later," You gotta be kidding me!
","This film was below average at best. Typical European liberal nonsense adorns this one. First, London is now a contaminated area and the UN, headed by the United States, of course, takes over. There is basically a police state where anyone who leaves the cordoned-off area is subject to immediate execution. The bumbling Americans are 'studying' the virus. And by 'studying', do we have scientists from every Ivy League school in the States over there? No. Perhaps doctors from Johns Hopkins, the best medical school on the planet? No. We have a handful of military scientists scampering around like morons to get some kind of idea what the Rage Virus even is. Leading the team of incompetent American military scientists is an even more incompetent team of American military officials who are portrayed as a bunch of trigger-happy buffoons, gunning down their own soldiers and innocent civilians in a frenzy.Now, as for the plot...well, the beginning sequence is pretty rad. Other than that, it is absolutely lame! The same kids who escape London, end up finding their own mother and she's still alive, go figure. Then, the father turns out to be the one they have to kill in the end. Please. How cheesy can you get? I'm not even gonna recommend this to those of you who, like myself, regard the original '28 Days Later' as a pretty decent modern day zombie flick. This movie is another subversive attempt to make the American military look incompetent and bumbling, and it fails on every level. Plus, it's not even fun. The only thing that redeems it is the first five or ten minutes, which, as I said, was done pretty well.3 out of 10, kids.",3,0,2,22 December 2007
Tropic Thunder," Typical mega-budget Jewish comedy that fails miserably.
","Yikes. Where do I start with this one? I mean, Ben Stiller. Maybe I should just leave it at that. This dude couldn't make a 13 year old stoner laugh. I think the ONLY time I ever thought he was funny was as the jerky nurse in 'Happy Gilmore.' 'Tropic Thunder' is a waste of money, time and plenty of decent actors. Why they all appear in this piece of crap is anyone's guess; I think Stiller probably paid them well. Obviously a huge budget here. It will appeal to the same crowd of morons who still think Saturday Night Live is hilarious. Boring plot, tired jokes, lukewarm satire and run of the mill slapstick run rampant through this turd. If you find that sort of thing entertaining, by all means, rent 'Tropic Thunder.'The fact that RDJ was nominated for an Oscar here??? Proof that the Oscars don't mean a thing anymore. The fact that this movie is rated above a 3 on IMDb??? Proof that Americans really are as dumb as the rest of the world thinks we are.Embarrassing! Oh, and I loved the cameo by Matthew McConaGAY. That guy needs to come out. Good Lord.2 out of 10, kids.",2,1,3,16 May 2009
No Country for Old Men," Well, it was no Fargo................
","'No Country for Old Men' is very overrated and I think to argue that would be silly. For those of us who have admired the Coens for years, this is standard, if not a little less-than-good, fare.The characters are thin and not convincing, (aside from Bardem of course, who creeps out even the toughest among us with his callous and merciless, haunting demeanor,) unrealistic and pretentiously written. We are treated to the meaningless philosophical ramblings of a sheriff whom we are never given the chance to know, much less love. The main character is killed off in a manner which is unfair to the viewers; we don't even get to see it happen. It is emotionless and pointless. Throughout the film, we are bombarded with beautiful images of the American west, but unlike in the superior 'Raising Arizona,' they prove to be nothing more than eye candy, for the story could have really taken place anywhere. And in any time for that matter. Which brings me to my next complaint: when does this story take place? Judging by the cars, clothing and style, I'm thinking early 80's? But it really doesn't matter.The story never goes anywhere, so much is left unexplained and it's nightmarishly vague. Sorry to say people, it just wasn't that good. I'll end this review like the film ends.Yet somehow, it is still better than most of the new stuff coming out and that is really sad. 6 out of 10, kids.",6,2,4,2 September 2008
The Pianist," Wow.
","'The Pianist' was a breath of fresh air for me. It has been a long time since I've seen a film this refreshing. I regret not seeing it sooner and if you haven't seen it, I recommend doing so.Painting a ultra-realistic portrait of one man's life during the darkest period in the 20th century, Polanski masterfully and easily shows what he can do with the right kind of brush I have always enjoyed his films; 'Rosemary's Baby' being one of my all time favorite movies. But 'The Pianist' is very different. It is quite serious and disturbing while not being gratuitous. The violence shown here is very sickening but it is never overly graphic. It is not exploitative, as it well shouldn't be. It is heart wrenching to say the least. Adrien Brody confidently commands the respect of the viewer in what has to be the role of his career. He definitely deserved the Oscar he got for this one.In short, every human being alive should see this film. It is unbiased, extremely effective and completely genuine. I never doubted for a moment that Roman's heart wasn't in it. Totally timeless and classic. See it!!! 10 out of 10, kids.",10,2,4,21 October 2008
City of God," National Geographic meets Goodfellas?
","'City of God' is a really awesome film. I enjoyed it. I have not, however, watched it since viewing it for the first time about 6 months ago. I haven't felt the need.I suppose it's the kind of movie you only need to see once. The acting is outstanding and the story is amazing too. The child growing up in the slums in a third world country who somehow manages to escape a life of crime and goes on to achieve greatness through photography. It really is a moving film, you can't argue that. Here is where I get annoyed...This film is NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING like 'Goodfellas' or 'Scarface.' Why it is always compared to films like that, I cannot even begin to understand. A large part of the plot surrounds gangs in Brazil, but it is also very political and extremely human. It is not about organized crime. It is, however, pretty violent though.In short, I dig this movie but if I hear one more person compare it to 'Goodfellas' I think I'll feed them a few copies of each DVD for good measure.8 out of 10, kids.",8,2,5,29 April 2008
The Mist," Do all new movies suck this bad ?
","Given the fact that I love Stephen King and own most of his movies on DVD and I also loved Darabont's 'The Shawshank Redemption,' (who didn't?) I had to check out this movie 'The Mist.' Boy, was I in for a disappointment.King's stories are often reputed to have been butchered by screenwriters and directors, but I didn't hear anything like that about this one. Maybe someone should have. I don't think the story translates well to the screen. I think it was a short story, so maybe they could have made a 30 minute TV show about this one because this was a waste of an hour and a half of my life.The movie opens with a family on a lake and a strange storm that brings with it a strange mist across the lake. The father takes the son into town and the mist comes into town. The rest of the film takes place pretty much in a supermarket, conveniently so the people can survive, and we witness 'human tragedy' and 'barbarism' between the shoppers. They barricade themselves in against these really corny large bugs and what not. In an obvious slam on Christianity, one horrible religious lunatic tries to take over and is killed in a coup de grace for the viewer. I wonder why they didn't make that lady a Muslim? Oh wait...that's not Hollywood! Finally, the American military is bashed because we learn that 'the mist' was an experiment gone array. Whoop dee doo. We've heard that one before.To cap it all off, the main character is 'forced' to murder his son in the end, then the mist is gone. We never know why, but there is sad music playing and we are supposed to feel compassion but what we really feel is cheated. Cheated out of investment of time, money and emotion.Like most modern Hollywood duds, this one falls way short. It's ashame because two amazing talents have had their names tarnished. Skip it and see the original 'Dawn of the Dead.' More creative and more powerful on a fraction of the budget.Gets a bonus star for Thomas Jane though, that guy is too cool for words.4 out of 10, kids.",4,1,4,2 September 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Those crazy little Hollywood people! What'll they think of next???
","'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is a curious case, alright! A curious case of 'we have made everything into a movie so what now...?' Brad Pitt is a superb actor and that cannot be denied. His performance here, along with Cate Blanchett's is wonderful. I really liked the chemistry those two had on screen. It reminded me of some classic Hollywood on-screen couples and that is a rare find in today's films.The plot was EXTREMELY similar to 'Forrest Gump.' Instead of a slow man, we have a man who is aging in reverse. Instead of a feather, we have a hummingbird. Instead of 'Jenny' we have Cate Blanchett. Instead of a shrimpin boat, we have a tugboat. And instead of Liutenant Dan, we have the tugboat captain. Not saying it was rip off or anything, I'm just saying; the similarities are numerous.The end of the movie was particularly upsetting, when we see a 'young' Benjamin suffering from dementia and paranoia as a little boy. I didn't really think it was necessary to have the whole 'Benjamin Button is my father!?' thing with that girl in the hospital, but hey: this is Hollywood.Gets an extra star because my girlfriend cried through the whole thing. I guess that counts for something.7 out of 10, kids.",7,0,2,15 May 2009
From Dusk Till Dawn," A little messy but so cool it doesn't matter.
","Definitely paving the road that Tarantino should have gone down, 'From Dusk Til Dawn' is one of my all time favorite movies. Amazingly badass opening scene. From there, the way the script flows is amazing; all the characters mesh well. Keitel, Liu and Lewis play a family kidnapped by Tarantino and Clooney (yes George Clooney) in a fantastic duo: the Gecko brothers, two criminals on the run to El Rey, Mexico. They rendezvous at an open-all-night nudie bar and it turns out to be a haven for vampires. Despite the fact that they are technically vamps, I still classify 'From Dusk Til Dawn' as a zombie film. It's gory, it's violent it's funny and it's grimy.I can't believe George Clooney is so cool in this. Why he didn't make more films like this, one can only guess. He makes a great low-life, intelligent criminal. Also, I wish Richard was a bit more likable. Why Tarantino made that character such a sicko is beyond me.All in all an awesome horror flick that seems to never get old. I wish Quentin and Robert still made em like this! 8 out of 10, kids.",8,0,0,15 November 2008
The Dark Knight," Rather predictable big-budget action flick that goes on too long.
","The excellent score, big money actors, impressive computer generated graphics and the death of Heath Ledger have obviously landed this film into a spot where, frankly in today's trendy, hype-loving, Hollywood-idealizing society, it squarely belongs. The fact that this film is number FIVE on the IMDb top 250...now that says a lot about who uses this website nowadays.Christian Bale's performance is unmemorable. His 'Batman' voice is over-produced and doubled-up to sound more superhero-ish. Maggie Gyllenhal is hardly acceptable as the film's 'belle' whom Aaron Eckhart and Mr. Bale both adore and long for. She isn't that great. (sorry Maggie!!!) Michael Caine seems bored with the whole project. The best actors are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman who don't need a big budget mess like 'The Dark Knight' to validate them as actors. Michael Keaton made a better Batman than Christian Bale. And now, I, The Lone Biker of the Apocalypse will spill the beans and skate on a sacrilegious razor blade: Jack Nicholson made a better Joker than Heath Ledger.By about an hour and a half in, I was looking at the clock, wondering when it would end. There are more twists and turns than a full season of 'General Hospital,' so many it hurts your neck to watch it. It comes across as being a jumbled mess in the end. Harvey Dent's fall from grace is so predictable you'd have to be a middle school student not to see it coming. And why the hell did they keep referring to Batman as 'The Batman?' That was just annoying.After all, I guess it was middle schoolers who have been on here giving this movie TEN stars. To say it was bad would be silly, but let me be frank: I am taking away 4 points just because I'm irritated at how overrated this movie is! To all you guys who told me 'you have to see this in the theater, it's the greatest movie ever made!' be thankful I was too busy last summer because I'd be coming after you for my ten bucks.3 out of 10, kids.",3,7,14,21 January 2009
Taken," Let's be honest here!
","I won't take anything away from the action-packed goodness of 'Taken.' No pun intended. This movie is right up there with 'Under Siege' and 'No Way Out' in terms of old-fashioned butt-kicking. But the plot? Please! Girl wants to go to Europe. Father (ex-mercenary) is worried off his rocker. Girl goes anyway. FIRST person she speaks to turns out to be a human trafficker and the girl gets sold into bondage. Father, of course, tracks down said trafficker and all his employers, right up to the top, and gets daughter back. Any of us who have been to 'the continent' will see this film as another ridiculous Hollywood example of how life in Europe really is. Does human trafficking go on? Of course and that is sad. But what are the chances that this girl gets kidnapped out of the million-or-so tourists traveling Europe at any given moment? It was a little dumb. They should have had the father not even know his kid was going. That would have made it a little more believable.I also loved how Liam Neeson kills hundreds of people, burns up building, blows up boats, etc and he returns to the States untouched to reunite his kid with her mother! What!? All in all, a nice little action movie but only as believable as Ahhnold's 'Commando.' 6 out of 10, kids.",6,1,2,9 May 2009
Groundhog Day," Hysterical and entertaining.
","I dare say that 'Groundhog Day' changed the face of comedy. The whole concept behind it is ingenious. One man, living the same day over and over again, eventually decides to make the most of it and he is changed forever.This movie is genuinely funny and it can't help being so. What person wouldn't find that concept funny? Even if it gets annoying eventually, it remains funny in the pit of your stomach because Phil is such a jerk in the beginning that it's hard to feel sorry for him. When we start to see his transformation, we see something that hits home for all of us: he is misunderstood. He wants to quit and turn back into a jerk. But eventually, even Phil Connors pulls through.Proof that given the chance, pretty much anyone can find happiness. It's all in your mindset. A surprisingly powerful message hidden in this comedy gem that will make you wet your pants and keep you so interested you won't bother changing until the movie is over.9 out of 10, kids.",9,1,2,2 November 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Michael Corleone turned into Frank Slade.
","Let me start off by saying this: I think most movies are underrated on IMDb. Maybe it's just the stuff I like; Italian horror, American slashers, giallos of the 1970's, and classic westerns. But it seems like a lot of my favorites get slammed on here.I love 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather Part 2,' but part 3 is really something to behold...As many times as I've watched this film, I can't get over the fact that Michael Corleone has disappeared. In fact, he morphed into a mix between himself and Lt. Colonel Frank Slade from 'Scent of a Woman.' I kept waiting for him to stand up and say 'HOO-AHH!'... Yes, I think Pacino overacted this one. As did almost everyone in 'The Godfather Part 3.' Joe Mantegna? I liked him better in that movie about the chess-player kid. He is about as believable as a gangster as Jessica Tandy would be. Eli Wallach? Excellent in 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.' But as an aging mafioso? Not good.This movie is cheeseball. It is as overacted as anything out there. The storyline is ridiculous: a mobster trying to go straight with legitimate business in unison with the Vatican. Come on now... They should have let 'The Godfather' series have a solid ending with Part 2. Part 3 is more funny than anything else.4 out of 10, kids.",4,3,6,12 April 2008
Rear Window," Satisfaction, on film.
","I'm not going to over-analyze the work of a genius. Hitchcock blows the roof off with this film. It's well acted, brilliantly directed, the story is awesome, and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.'Rear Window' has an absolutely timeless appeal. I loved the setting, too. It's a delicious slice of Americana and it oozes with beautiful images of times past and Hitchcock achieves it all from one view from one apartment. The plot is simple, easy to follow, believable, and fun. The characters are easy to identify with and there is no overacting, which I feel is a usual deterrent from lots of 'classic' Hollywood films.'Rear Window' is totally awesome and I recommend it to anyone.10 out of 10, kids.",10,1,4,3 January 2008
Donnie Darko," Jake Gyllenhaal steals the show. Again.
","'Donnie Darko' is probably the definitive 'teen movie' of the new millennium so far.Starting off as an eerie black comedy, the story spirals into an insane web of mystery and the supernatural. There are healthy amounts of humor thrown in for good measure and it actually works very well here. We don't really know what is going on until the end and when we do find out what Frank The Demon Bunny Rabbit is really all about, it is shocking and it makes the hairs on your arms stand up. Follow it to the end, you will not regret it.I would give this movie a ten if it weren't for the abysmal acting and utter uselessness of Drew Barrymore and her character in 'Donnie Darko.' She hams it up big time, never believable for a moment as a high school teacher. She is outclassed here by every other actor in the bunch and should have remained merely a producer because she looks terrible. She almost ruined it but 'Donnie Darko' is such a great flick, even SHE couldn't do that.See it.9 out of 10, kids.",9,2,5,15 February 2009
The Wizard of Oz," Kids today.
","Kids today are weak, they play video games from the couch and cry when mommy doesn't buy the right kind of sugar cereal. The fact that 'The Wizard of Oz' sits so low on the IMDb top 250 list is a testament to the young, immature users that have clearly flooded the gates here on this website. The fact that it has been beaten by such works as 'Memento' and 'The Dark Knight' is laughable.I watched this last night for the first time in years. I had forgotten how well this film was done; arguably the most visually stunning of our time. The way Dorothy's whole world is black and white and then she enters Oz, full of color. To think that this came out back in 1939 is a trip. I can't imagine the first people to see this film. They must have been completely blown away. You just can't amaze like that anymore. All you can do as a viewer is try to put yourself back there and if you can do that, you can appreciate this film and all its glory.I had forgotten how scary some of the sequences are here. I think it was smart that they lightened the story a bit for the big screen and made it more for kids. It's plenty dark and grimy for my tastes. Those flying monkeys haunted my sleep when I was a kid and who can forget the melting wicked witch of the West? Or her sister's feet shriveling up when the ruby slippers disappear? Or the evil trees in the forest, grabbing the apple back from Dorothy? Made in a time when kids played outside, got bruises, black eyes, worked at age 14 and lived in the midst of World Wars, 'The Wizard of Oz' is certainly a wild, undeniably groundbreaking and brilliant film. I recommend seeing this one again so you can remember what real, beautiful film making is all about.10 out of 10, kids.",10,6,8,16 November 2008
