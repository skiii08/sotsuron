Resident Evil: Afterlife," so bad, i had to write a review
","i just got back from the cinema after this badly directed, written movie, what where they thinking when they done this, the movie is bad, i like the first 3 but this one is bad, i read couple of reviews before i went hoping that the bad ones are untrue, but i was wrong, i totally agree with all the bad reviews, the acting is weak, no point of the movie what so ever, continuing the story, but killing it as well, i hope people read the bad reviews and believe them, if u liked the 3 first movies, then stay away from this one, because you will be disappointed, this is my second review here on IMDb, and i had to get this out from my system before someone else makes the mistake of watching this",Null,3,9,14 September 2010
Avatar," i was blown away
","go watch this movie, if you like this Genre or you don't, you will love this film, most people are criticising this story, well i say the whole movie is amazing, the animation is amazing, everything looks real, the story is simply great, there is no doubt this movie is going for an Oscar, at least nominated if not winning one, i recommend to watch the movie in 3D or Imax, because u will enjoy every moment of it, this is my first comment here on IMDb, and i say this is one of my top ten favourite movies of all time. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story line, because you have to expect everything good from this outstanding work, some people were comparing it to Titanic, well its far far away from that, the animals and the world created is just great, perfect",9,4,10,19 December 2009
