The Finest Hours," Great long-distance romance
","There is a peculiar kind of beautiful romance in this movie where Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his fiancÃ©e Miriam (Holliday Grainger) are away from each other for most of the movie and death might do them part and yet their love is evident at every corner. Chris Pine shines brilliantly in depicting Coast Gaurd officer
Bernie Webber's outstanding courage and Holliday Grainger swept me off my feet with the delicateness and devotion to her love that she oozes.A heady romance drama set in the treacherous waters off the coast of Massachusetts.",9,0,0,15 February 2020
The Young Victoria," Quite a bore
","Most other period dramas have gone to great lengths to sell the audience on royalty while this one, I'm afraid, falls flat. The storyline seems incoherent and disjunct and the acting is too underwhelming to get you to relate to the characters and feel their human side. The movie is boring overall.",4,0,0,1 December 2019
Knives Out," Not just any whodunnit
",Ana de Armas excels once again as the innocent-looking girl hiding a dark secret. You get fooled into thinking that the truth has been uncovered and then something totally else comes up in the end.,10,0,2,23 June 2020
Aquaman," My next best comic book movie
",I haven't been a fan of DC Comics' recent movies but this movie was exceptional. The places it showed and the adventures over land and under the sea were well wrought. Jason Momoa and Amber Heard had a wonderful chemistry and I also liked the environmental message about the damage we did to the oceans.,10,1,7,23 May 2020
Ready Player One," Visually stunning
","I was actually shocked to see Steven Spielberg's name on such a CGI-laden movie about a virtual reality game. It was so excellent in every way: the acting, the story, the CGI. I loved it!",10,1,1,30 January 2020
The Bodyguard," Bad story
","Probably like everyone else I watched this movie because it was the movie where Whitney Houston sang the otherworldly song 'I Will Always Love You.' Someone once asked why all the good songs came from bad movies. I can see Kevin Costner and Whitney tried their best, but there just wasn't any tangible chemistry, never mind the dull, incoherent story.",6,0,0,25 June 2020
The Ottoman Lieutenant," Great romance
","Once again the World Wars prove to be the most enchanting settings for period romance movies. The only catch is, I wish there was much more of these passionate romance scenes between Lillie and Ismail. The chemistry was superb and the story of East and West falling in love is always an intriguing one to tune in to.",9,0,0,15 January 2020
Interstellar," Watching the theory of relativity in stark action
","It might be that I haven't watched much stuff like this myself, but to my mind this movie teaches the theory of relativity in the most shocking fashion possible.To realise that two people, just because they are at different points in space, will experience time differently will overwhelm you witless. Even more unfathomable is that the way this universe works, these laws of physics, appear to have been created especially for us. Humans are the only entities that can make sense of time - we age, we do things by spending time, we can feel it, and we can totally choose to ignore it while we sleep. Perhaps one day we might really make use of what has meaning only to us.Christopher Nolan is a genius.It is the kind of sci-fi that is heartrending, nerve-wracking, and will move you to tears.",10,1,4,3 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Only the second movie that I chose to watch for the second time
","I had been out of the loop over Marvel movies for too long until I watched this movie, then I decided to watch all the previous ones. I have yet to pull that off, but nonetheless I wanted to go back and watch this epic conclusion again with the benefit of hindsight and it never ceases to be so awe-inspiring.The other movie I watched a second time was 'Interstellar,' by the way.This time I'm scaling the rating up from 8 to 10.Looking back you can't help marveling at the unrivaled labors of 12 years and 22 movies from Marvel Studios. They really did create a wonderful world of their own.And to remember how naive Robert Downey, Jr. looked in the first 'Iron Man' in retrospect, compared to where he wound up in 'Avengers: Endgame' - the giant on whose shoulders everyone else in this Marvel Universe stands - that is something that could not be said even of 'Star Wars.'Happy trails.",10,2,7,24 February 2020
Quantum of Solace," At least better than Daniel Craig's debut
","There is more action worthy of a spy movie here than there was in 'Casino Royale.' Still, there is nothing particularly overawing about the spy work. There is no question that 'Mission Impossible,' Ethan Hawke and Tom Cruise will remain far superior to James Bond and Daniel Craig.",8,0,2,21 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I wish there was more of Margot Robbie
","This was the first movie I watch starring Margot Robbie where she is not an obnoxious crazy killer ('Suicide Squad,' 'Terminal'), so I am so sad I didn't get to see more of her normal side in this movie. Other than that, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio's characters are excellent and very affable.Good job, Quentin Tarantino!",9,2,4,30 January 2020
Good Will Hunting," 1990s masterpiece
",The idea behind this movie really hit home for me. Is genius a blessing or curse? What does one really want to do with one's life?,10,1,1,18 March 2020
Ex Machina," Really good but could have been better
","The movie lacked the kind of intense, out-of-this-world, mind-blowing sci-fi stuff that I had expected, but perhaps that is how Alex Garland likes to keep his work realistic and engaging without all the visuals effects bells and whistles.All in all, it's yet another great movie to cudgel up your brain as to what it really means to be human. This is was most salient when Caleb got so confused and disconcerted he started to think he might be an AI robot himself and cut his arm to see the blood for himself.A truly phenomenal and ingenious masterpiece.",9,0,1,8 March 2020
Midsommar," What the heck is wrong with European horror?
","I watched 'Midsommar' to watch Florence Pugh after all the fame she got this year from 'Little Women,' just like I had watched 'Suspiria' for Dakota Johnson, and I was thinking 'It better not be like 'Suspiria'.' It turned out to be quite like 'Suspiria.'I appreciate the effort, imagination and creativity they spent on these movies but there just appears to be a clichÃ© common to these European horror movies that is not entirely appealing to my taste. The story of a tight-knit community that turns out to be diabolically evil looks quite well worn these days.Anyways, the seven-star rating goes to Florence Pugh. I loved her.",7,1,4,16 March 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Disney lives up to its name
","What a visual feast this was. With this and other live-action remakes of hit classics, Disney has proven it can conquer all genres possible. The CGI and motion capture done on The Beast (Dan Stevens) was groundbreaking, phenomenal and visually enchanting. The songs are totally out of this world. Josh Gad is uproariously hilarious. The greedy, egocentric Captain Gaston is masterfully portrayed by Luke Evans. But above all, Emma Watson earns a place among Disney's princesses with her unrelenting love, outstanding wits and vivacious charm.",10,0,0,29 June 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," What a wonderful world!
","Marvel never ceases to get you absolutely smitten with every new world it creates, doesn't it? Every character is always hugely likable and we are immediately hooked on the exceptionally solid stories. It's truly marvelous.",10,0,0,12 January 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," A ruthless roller coaster of a movie
","Three hours of typical Martin Scorsese knocking you sideways, sweeping you off your feet and blowing your fuse are what you get with this film. Every scene excels in bringing the animal in all of us and every other scene or so is a giddy whirlpool of unmitigated profligacy and orgies that make you question how true the story really is. Jordan Belfort is a character that can't stop plumbing the depths of depravity, drowning in wads upon wads of banknotes and seizing every opportunity he eyes, and the magnificent Leonardo DiCaprio delivers perfectly as always. Sometimes I bust a gut laughing and other times I put my palm on my mouth in shock, and all the while I had my heart racing and pounding at the nonstop thrill ride.It's an eternal work of art.",10,2,3,27 January 2020
Fifty Shades of Grey," Why all the hate?
","I feel mad at all the 1/10 reviews and the walkouts. People are complaining it was mediocre and wasn't as intense as it was billed to be. Seriously? And if it were the slightest bit more intense than bondage and spanking, they'd harp on how revolting it was. To my mind, yes, there was no overarching plot, but then again not all successful romance movies have had to have that, and it was the first installment in a trilogy, so the build-up should be understandable. It's a BDSM story, after all, isn't it?And the acting? It was beyond reproach. The chemistry between Dakota and Jamie? It was absolutely stunning. The only catch is that the storyline sounded flat and not fully developed, but maybe that's the point? Maybe that's a new subgenre of romance?",8,3,4,10 January 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," The best trilogy of all time
","Christopher Nolan proved he is so ahead of the curve with his directing on this series he is totally something else. Christian Bale will always remain the best Batman ever, Michael Caine the best Alfred (and butler character in any movie whatsoever) and Morgan Freeman the best Lucius Fox.I also enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt's stellar performance as the one man who never lost hope in the darkest of times. It's a shame they never made a new movie out of his character afterwards.I am also glad I had finished reading Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities' just the other night or else I wouldn't have recognized that quote from it at the end of the movie.",10,3,6,20 March 2020
Black Panther," A brilliant celebration of African culture
",This movie is once again proof that the Marvel movies aren't just a huge-budget superhero CGI juggernaut. The way it depicted indignation at the oppression of blacks in this country and how T'chala handled it was perfect.,10,3,7,8 February 2020
The Greatest Showman," Best musical ever!
",I loved the story and all the songs in this more than any other musical movie. They were so full of life and hope. Zendaya is such a great talent.,10,2,2,1 April 2020
Casino Royale," Little action
","An entire hour set around a spy trying to outsmart a terrorist at poker or bridge or whatever it was isn't my idea of a good spy movie. There was too little action for something that's supposed to be the reboot of a spy movie franchise, and Eva Green's character remained terribly undeveloped and so was her relationship to James Bond. I didn't feel for the two of them at all. Terribly underwhelming.",6,1,5,21 May 2020
Amélie," The most boring movie I've ever watched
","I first stumbled on this movie through its soundtrack, which was beautiful, and I heard a lot about how appealing and enchanting it is, but once I watched it I couldn't make heads or tails of why on Earth people would feel that way. It is so disjunct, slow-paced and boring I fell asleep towards the end and I didn't even realize I had missed over ten minutes. Amélie as a character looks really obnoxious with that self-absorbed smirk plastered on her face, and her gamine hair style is hardly apt. She just keeps going around manipulating people's lives in a far-fetched and annoying manner, and to cap it all, her elusiveness through the cat-and-mouse encounters with her love interest is disappointing, intimidating and unnerving. Almost every other character is no less objectionable.",3,4,7,2 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Were all 1970s movies like this?
","The special effects are impressive for a movie from that time - I'll give them that. But the acting was off on quite a few occasions and I never got goosebumps like the goosebumps I got from Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Felicity Jones in this decade's movies. The fighting scenes were quite boring and tawdry, too, and the dogfight at the end was long-drawn-out and you couldn't make sense of what exactly was happening.",7,2,10,29 December 2019
Cloud Atlas," I'm gonna read the novel
","Perhaps the single most surreal movie I've ever seen! It felt very weird to see each actor play different characters across different times, including those of another race. The make-up artists certainly deserved an Oscar for this!The whole three hours is unblinking high-octane action and suspense. Transitioning from the 19th century to the distant future in an instant has to be an insurmountable feat, and the filmmakers did a marvelous job of it.",10,0,1,25 June 2020
Cloud Atlas," I'm gonna read the novel

Kingsman: The Secret Service," The best spy movie franchise I've ever seen
","Between brilliant British humor and extreme brawling action scenes, this franchise has proven so spectacular and splendid it probably even beats time-honored ones like James Bond. Taron Egerton, Colin Firth and Mark Strong have such a fantastic chemistry together that can only cheer you up, and Samuel L. Jackson and Sofia Boutella absolutely made their mark with their outstanding villain performances.",10,1,1,30 March 2020
Green Book," Heartbreaking and heartwarming
","Once again my heart is broken at watching how normalized racism and segregation were just half a century ago in this country, how normal it was for white people to use racial slurs and treat black people like inferiors. I mean, the word 'racism' itself probably didn't even exist at the time. But the story of Tony Lip and Don Shirley's growing friendship brought me great comfort and I'm really grateful there were such good people, however few, among all the herds of bigots.",10,1,1,29 March 2020
Spectre," Underwhelming
",This was probably the only spy franchise movie with barely any jaw-dropping spy stuff and eye-popping visual effects scenes. Nothing more than a trudging chase after a mysterious villain who doesn't even sound so mysterious. And the romance between Daniel Craig and Lea Séydoux falls short.,6,0,4,11 February 2020
The Nice Guys," Ryan Gosling as a ragdoll
",This was an ecstatics spectacle. Ryan Gosling just keeps falling off and tumbling and walking out unscathed in search of the truth. And the beautiful vibe of 1970s Los Angeles is brought it to perfection.,9,14,15,4 February 2020
Macbeth," Not enjoyable
","So true to the actual text, this was a harsh reminder of how difficult and almost unfathomable Shakespearean English was for me. I had thought it would be an intelligible modern English adaptation, like history movies, as it were, but it turned out to be akin to an actual play on tape.",6,0,0,21 March 2020
Sully," No goosebumps like Tom Hanks' goosebumps
","I had goosebumps. I cried. Tom Hanks with a mustache also reminds me of my late father, so I can't help feeling the attachment.",9,0,0,16 December 2019
