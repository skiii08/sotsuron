Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good introduction of the saga, see the Jedi order in its splendor.
","I think that is a good entertaining movie but isn't a new proposal in Sci-fi genre, itÂ´s agree with the saga and has a consistent argument related with the others. If you expect a 'star war typical movie' you got it.",6,1,2,23 June 1999
