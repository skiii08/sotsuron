Alien 3," Ripley's Nightmare!
","I think I'm being overgenerous in saying this third 'attempt' was disappointing. First off I was devastated by the way Hicks and Newt had been killed off and what can I say about poor Bishop being chucked into the rubbish?Secondly you don't really care for any of the characters like in the previous Alien movies. It didn't help much that they were all bald and so you couldn't tell them apart!! Other than that this film isn't bad (and Resurrection) if you consider this. They never happened! Ripley is still in Hypersleep, having one long nightmare provoked by her experiences on LV426. After all she did end Aliens with Newt asking her 'can I dream?'. So that's what's happened. She'll wake up marry Hicks,adopt Newt and live happily ever after.(Yeah? and then they'll return to earth and discover that Hudson hadn't really died, he'd escaped the aliens clutches, found an abandoned ship and took off before the place was nuked!) Now I'm dreaming! O.k, but seriously I think if they must make ANOTHER alien film, they should try and answer the questions raised from the original movie like...-Where are the aliens from in the first place?-Where did that boneship come from and what/who was the dead pilot?",Null,395,413,12 May 1999
Aliens," Nominees for 'most watched film of all time go to'
","This is sci-fi, action, horror all rolled into one! This film totally kicks some serious alien butt! Simply becoz it's got it all! Stunning affects, gripping suspense, believable characters, and the music adds to the thrill of the ride!Films come and go with the current trends but this film has definitely surpassed the test of time. It's my most watched movie and just becoz I now know the lines by heart, I'm still chilled by the suspense of it all (and I still laugh at Hudson!!)
(By the way Crowe does speak...Just after Vasquez has done the push ups after coming out of hyper-sleep, Crowe grabs her hand and says 'Oh Vasqez, that's just too bad')",10,0,0,29 April 1999
The Truman Show," UNMISSABLE!
","This is cinema at its best! A completely original and deeply moving masterpiece that left a real impression on me. You know a film's good when ya still thinking about it months later and this movie had many memorable moments!! (Especially that scene on the pier-it's unique!)
Brilliant performances by both Jim Carrey and Ed Harris. I don't get why Carrey got a golden globe but wasn't even nominated at the oscars! They both woz robbed!Trust me when I say 'SEEING THIS IS A MUST!'",Null,0,0,29 April 1999
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Most Triumphant!
","This has gotta be one of the most enjoyable movies ever!!(This and Bogus Journey) I just love it and live it. Did anyone else like me get raised eyebrows from teachers when you pronounced 'Socrates'? Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are just brilliant as the dimwitted teenagers. Bill Espreston Esquire (Winter) and Ted Theodore Logan (Reeves), who together are 'Wyld Stalions' are in danger of flunking history...if that happens Ted will be sent to military school in Alaska and then their band will never happen. This will have devastating consequences on the future, a society free of war, pollution, ('even the dirt is clean') thanx to Wyld Stalions music. But all is not lost...in comes Rufus, a sorta guardian angel type character from the future. He's come back in time to help'm out. And what better way of passing history than to have a time machine, 'not bad!'",Null,0,2,12 May 1999
Goodfellas," The 'Don' of the gangster movies.
","Since watching this film I've been hooked on watching gangster movies, from 'The Godfather' to 'A Bronx Tale'. All are good (and the Godfather is a classic) but Goodfellas is my favourite. It is superbly cast, Deniro, Pesci and Liotta are all equally brilliant, possibly pulling off the best performance of their careers!'Goodfellas' depicts the true story of life in the Mafia through the eyes of Henry Hill, originally told in the Book 'Wise Guys' by Nicholas Pileggi. Scorese's portrayal of the story brings it to life and I highly recommend it. If you are a fan of the gangster genre then 'Goodfellas' is not to be missed.",Null,0,0,16 November 2001
