Marie Antoinette," do not waste your time
","I was absolutely bored from the first to the last minute of the movie. For me, there was no story line WHATSOEVER. OK, a film doesn't have to have a story to be good - but there wasn't anything that entertains you or makes you think or does SOMETHING to you. It doesn't even have a special atmosphere like Lost in Translation or The Virgin Suicides. There is no character development either. Kirsten Dunst acts like... well, like a human being. She laughs, she breathes, she walks and so on. No real dialogues, no real acting, no nothing. Absolute nothingness. Marie Antoinette was a new experience to me - no movie I ever watched had that effect on me, not even those painfully predictable Hollywood comedies bore me THAT much. I sat in the cinema and was looking approximately every 7 minutes on my watch because I was bored out of my skull. Sorry for repeating myself...It was a complete and utter waste of time.",2,4,6,16 January 2007
