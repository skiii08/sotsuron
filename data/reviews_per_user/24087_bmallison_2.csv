E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Love and sacrifice...
","The movie opens with a spaceship in the middle of the forest. There are many aliens there working on plant life. The seem to have it growing inside of the ship and they are picking up some from the forest floor to take with them. Humans show up and try to capture the aliens. The aliens close up their ship and ET gets left behind. The humans keep looking for him but he hides well. Soon Elliot discovers ET in his back shed but his family doesn't believe him. Everyone goes out to search, but find nothing. Everyone goes to bed except for Elliot. He wasn't convinced that it was nothing. He goes back outside to search. Elliot and ET run right into each other and they both start screaming in fear of one another.The next morning Elliot leaves the house and decides to leave a trail of food in order to meet up with ET again. That night Elliot is really determined to find ET so he sleeps in his backyard. Soon, ET comes out of the shed and reappears to Elliot. Elliot is terrified at first but understands that ET won't hurt him. Elliot takes him into his house and up to his bedroom. Elliot falls asleep and the next morning fakes being sick so he won't have to go to school. He tries to communicate with ET but the language barrier is too difficult to make work. When Elliot's brother and sister get home from school, he shows them. Their reactions were horrible, but they all agree to keep him a secret.Elliot eventually has to start attending school again. ET is left at home to get into everything. ET gets in the fridge and drink all the beer. Somehow Elliot ends up drunk at school. This is the first time we see that ET and Elliot have linked up and are now in a sense one with each other. By the end of the day, ET can talk and he starts building technology to contact his home. There now sits a truck across from their house that detects that ET is living with them. The next day the kids and ET go out trick or treating for Halloween. This will be their first attempt to connect ET with his home. While everyone is out of the house, the people parked outside decide to break into the house to look for evidence. ET's invention to call home works and Elliot is very excited. Then he realizes that he's going to lose ET and that makes him cry.The next day, Elliot and ET get really really sick. They both feel like they are dying. Elliot's mom tries to run away with the children but men in space suits show up and take ET and Elliot. ET separates from Elliot and Elliot gets healthy. ET continues to keep getting sicker. Finally ET dies. Next thing we know, ET is alive and Elliot and his brother steal ET because his people are coming for him. Everyone is in an uproar! All the adults are chasing the kids who are trying to take ET back to his ship. The kids make it to the forest and the spaceship appears. For me, the theme of this movie is sacrifice. ET needed help and the children protected him and took care of him. Once he was dying, they felt helpless and afraid. When he died, that was the lowest point of the movie. The despair felt by the children was unbearable. Once ET came back to life, the children knew it was do or die. They sacrificed everything to make sure ET was safe and with his people. All that sacrifice happened because of love!",8,0,2,14 December 2016
Rise of the Guardians," Love this movie!

He questioned why he was there and what he was suppose to do. He didn't get an answer. Learning to fly amused him. He was happy! He then walked into a small village and started being friendly with the people but he doesn't realize they can't hear him until one of them walks through him. That's when the moon told him his name was Jack Frost. That was all he was ever told.The next scenes show North noticing an imbalance on the globe.

Jack agrees to help just this once to defeat Pitch to save the children from terror. Pitch decides to take on each character one by one so the children will stop believing in them. He starts with Tooth and then moves on to making Sandy disappear. Tooth becomes very weak to battle, so all that is left is North, Bunny, and Jack. Pitch then ruins Easter so Bunny then becomes too weak to battle. The final battle is between Jack and Pitch. Jack enlists some neighborhood kids that still believe in the Guardians. Their strength helps Jack and together they defeat Pitch. Pitch ends up being forced to go back under the bed where he is trapped and forced to stay away from all of the children.The lessons in this movie are simple. There is always going to be good and evil in life. As a child, you believe in both. As an adult, good and evil are still a part of life but in very different ways. One can always choose to believe in good or evil. Evil will take away happiness every time. The theme of this movie shows how believing in good can make your life wonderful.",7,1,1,13 December 2016
