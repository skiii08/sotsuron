The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Book to Movie...Loved it...
","OK, I read the series and had started to read Mockingjay a second time last month, I stopped just after they had to run to the bottom barracks and then today my daughter and I saw it at the theater. I loved it! People say there is not enough action...um the books have a lot of CEREBRAL story so yeah not a lot of action but for me there was enough..right in the spots it should be. I was wondering where they were going to 'cut' it and end it and thought where they did was a good place. I was shocked at the difference in 'Peetas' look from the beginning to the end...wow a lot of weight lost in his face..good acting by the way too. Woody Harrelson was great, Jennifer Lawrence singing the 'Hanging Tree' was good, the whole scene gave me chills...they should have put that song on the soundtrack!! The scenery is perfect, everything they did pretty much fit the books true. There were a few things different but not so much that it changed anything to where you would go 'but..blech' lol.All in all if you loved the first 2 you will love this movie...I think a true fan of the books will love this movie too. Can NOT wait for next year!",10,23,63,22 November 2014
