Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Very good action martial arts adventure stuff... A+
","I'm gonna keep this short and quick... like my grandma driving.PRO's- good acting, great story, great actors, good director, this is a sequel that is good unlike ring 2 and saw 2, great action, nice fight sequences, and well just plain fun to watch.CON's- um... ah... what were we talking about??? i don't see anything wrong with this movie. which is the actual truth.DiFFerenT. i like movies that are different and this is a good example. Its not a trilogy and its a sequel thats as good as the first one.So go out there and get this movie.A must for your movie collection. SO if you like action, adventure, martial arts, and a female hero. Then I'm sure you would love this movie.",9,1,4,2 May 2006
The Ring," a movie with a big scare... B++
","OK.For those of you reading my history of comments. You know how we're gonna do this.I'm gonna keep this short and to the point like macaroni.PRO's- the scare factory is producing chills and screams in this movie, DIFFERENT in a good scary way, immersive, scary in a strange-thats-not-right way.CON's- I'm 24 and my brother is 26... this movie scared him. So you tell me... is there a con about a movie that scares your big brother??? I don't think so.Like i said before... it scared my brother which is a plus plus. It didn't scare me though. Maybe there's something wrong with me. Anycase the movie is good horror movie and to me this is the only horror movie out there. All other scary movies are not scary at all.Watch this movie and wait 7 days.",8,0,1,2 May 2006
The Girl Next Door," Man people make long comments... This movie is a B+
","Again... I'm gonna keep this short and to the point. I mean is there a need to read long comments about the movie???PRO's- funny scenes, nice chemistry between the 2 main characters, a good story, and different.CON's- it has a flaw somewhere near the end but it doesn't really mess up any part of the movie. Hmmm... The movie probably will give you a good tingle in the end. That comment doesn't mean the movie is bad. It would give you a tingle like the ending in Sleepless in Seattle. If you haven't seen that, then... Titanic only without the sad ending... no? OK, then... ummm Romeo and Juliet? sad ending too right?OK... the ending will make you feel good. THERE! NO SAD PARTS.",8,3,4,2 May 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Great to watch... A+
","Short and to the point... like a Hanzo sword.PRO's- great actors, great acting, directed by Q. Tarrantino, full of action, nice story, and DIFFERENT in a good way.CON's- um...what were we talking about? Action flick inspired from martial arts movies... 'Wa-TAH!.' Adventure... 'LETS GET OUT OF HERE!' Suspense... 'GET DOWN!' More of the Suspense... 'GET DOWN AGAIN!' A good movie to watch. So watch it.You wont regret it...Well only if you don't like action, martial arts, and a heroine.A female hero. Not the drug.",9,0,2,2 May 2006
Saw," Good... i'd give it a B++
","i just realized that a B++ is pretty much an A, right?OK... I'm gonna keep this short and sweet like peach pie.PRO's- DIFFERENT AND UNPREDICTABLE is the reason i like this movie, gives thrill's and chill's, and strange in a good way... CON's- story is lacking a bit... to me its lacking something.Movies these days are predictable except for this movie. Twisted was a movie i successfully predicted and so i didn't like Twisted.This movie is good enough... since its not in theaters... rent or buy it then.",8,0,2,2 May 2006
Cinderella Man," A good movie... A++
","I'm gonna keep this short and straight to the point. Because i know you don't wanna read a long comment. But this movie actually deserves a really long comment.PRO's- really good acting, great directing, the viewers emotions will definitely be manipulated, and worth your time.CON's- i cant think of anything bad with this movie... It feels good to say a good movie has arrived. I hope you, the reader, know what I'm talking about.I'm 24 years old. And i like watching movies. This movie will not disappoint.",9,1,1,2 May 2006
V for Vendetta," OK... i give it a C+
","Short and to the point is how i do these comments.PRO's- the 2 action sequences, story is kinda good, and i guess the 2 action sequences.CON's- there's only 2 action sequences, its British, some part of the movie is streatched really long, kinda corny at the end.OK. Now let me tell you why.The movie is based on somebody's graphic novels.Well i didn't read the novels. Also i have nothing against British... just the British comedy thing doesn't appeal to me. Since this is a part of the Wachowsky's work, i thought it would be a good movie like the MATRIX. The ending hit corn fields. For those of you who don't know... it means corny-ish or the essence of corny.Rent this movie.Its nothing like the MATRIX.",7,1,2,2 May 2006
