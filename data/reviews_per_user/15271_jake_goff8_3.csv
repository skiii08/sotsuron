The Blair Witch Project," Hmmmmm it could be scary...
","I found the movie to be ..... well not scary unless you are in the right frame of mind. While watching it i was frightened at the times i was thinking 'What if i was in this position?'. I have always been afraid of camping and being lost in a wood while being hunted. Just to imagine knowing whats going to happen when night comes but not being able to do a thing about it. Otherwise its just not scary enough for a movie and i cant see myself getting nightmares over it. I was mad frustrated with the ending as well? WHAT HAPPENS!? I HATE IT! i've yet to see the second one but i just want questions answered! we don't know enough about the witch and her power, what she is and who she is. The short amount of interviews at start just aren't enough and even now it annoys me!",3,0,1,27 August 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," ooh so clever!
",There's an obvious cast of highly respected a-list actors and actresses here and each one has given a performance to nearly if not the best of their capabilities. I'm not just going to explain the story as you can read it in the blurb although i will say just as you think you have figured out the twist and that you know what is going to happen you find you are wrong to a high level and a new piece of the puzzle appears. Iv got to say that Josh Hartnett makes a great main character and from this movie has made me respect him more. Lucy Lui takes a step back with just a supporting role and is convincing in that as well. All in all this is a enjoyable film that will leave you well entertained!!!,9,0,2,2 September 2006
National Treasure," Its like a history lesson....WITH YOUR FAVOURITE TEACHER!!!!
","Being English i knew absolutely nothing about any American History. Sure, I'd heard about 'The Declaration of Independence' and 'The Boston Tea Party' from television programs and local coffee shops :D but was never aware of the importantness of them and how many Americans still follow the examples made in their past. National Treasue is a light hearted adventure for any age packed with real American history and believable past fiction. I'd usually switch off a film like this and never arrange to see it at the cinema with friends. Being still a young teen at 15 i still found this a film that any mature teen or adult could enjoy. Nicolas Cage isn't as gormless as usual and is even quite witty. Justin Bartha is the one who always has just random lines that are supposed to make you laugh, and they did for me but maybe thats my younger side thinking. I'm sure its this that makes me think that Diane Kruger steals the show ;) ha ha",9,0,2,27 August 2006
