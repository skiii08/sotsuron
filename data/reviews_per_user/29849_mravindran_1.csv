Skyfall," Are you people for real
","Went to see the movie in imax. After the end of the movie i realised this is one among the worst bond movies i have ever seen. The opening song was good visually i would say. No storyline continuation. Where is the hard drive ?? Where are the gadgets, women and style you see in all bond movies. Where do you get all these raving reviews. If you are true bond lover, this movie is a shame to bonds legacy. I would wait until all these fake proud reviewers have praised bond enough. Its just like another taken 2 movie. M and her love for her work is the only positive i see in this movie. Bond is just not bond enough in this movie. Someone directing the next bond movie please give a serious thought to what all the previous bond movies had in them. A decent plot, a real bond and some believable gadgets just for the fun at least and yeah some women.",6,17,47,28 October 2012
