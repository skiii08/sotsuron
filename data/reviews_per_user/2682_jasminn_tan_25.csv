The Devil's Advocate," The Cost of Vanity!
","This is one movie that brilliantly highlights the true consequences of loving yourself more than anyone else. Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a prosecutor-turned-lawyer in this movie and he ignores his good conscience in order to win his cases and free actual perpetrators. He gets headhunted by an office in New York and simply put, things get freaky. His new boss seems to favour him more than everyone else despite him being the 'newbie' in the firm and his wife suffers from nightmares and hallucinations. All the while, he keeps working and winning high profile cases that have been assigned to him by his boss. He has no soul anymore, and all he cares about is his winning streak and his career. Until a very unfortunate event forces him to re-evaluate his life.This is one of Keanu's best performances, in my opinion. For most of the movie, he's the bad guy and he *sells* it. He's able to compartmentalize his emotions and when he's angry, it's shown with such vigour that you can't help but be angry on his behalf as well. Al Pacino who plays the devil boss is also right in his element. He's not outright evil but every action of his weighs heavily on whomever is on the receiving end. Al Pacino makes a really good villain honestly. Another standout performance is by Charlize Theron who plays Lomax's wife. She is the doting and supporting wife of a successful lawyer and she gradually withers away into a woman who has been tortured by the devil himself. Her fear and distress aren't real but a damn good actress like her makes it look real.",9,0,0,18 December 2019
Howl's Moving Castle," Charming and Whimsical
","This was such a lovely film to watch! The characters were so wonderful and as always, the art was absolutely beautiful.",10,0,0,19 April 2020
John Wick," No Bullet is Wasted
","John Wick, as his enemies say, is a man of focus, commitment and sheer will. This movie has very little real plot but the action scenes which have been said to be performed mostly by Keanu Reeves make up for it. Every bullet has its purpose and I am amazed at John Wick's shooting skills. He kills anyone who gets in his way with a bullet to the head and very efficiently at that.",8,0,0,29 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Wanted To Like This Better
","There's something about this movie that just didn't excite me as much as I thought it would. I'm not sure, but maybe if they had released this before Infinity War, I would've liked it better? It's an okay movie overall, but I still can't believe that this was the origin of The Avengers, probably because Captain Marvel was never even mentioned the first 10 years since the first Marvel movie was released, so she doesn't seem very relevant and thus, I'm not as invested in her as I am with the other Avengers.",7,2,3,7 May 2020
Knives Out," Hilarious and Unexpected
","Fantastic writing and cast, I definitely did not expect Daniel Craig's character to have a French name and a Southern drawl. The dialogue was witty and funny and I was so wrong about the murder, which is always a great thing because it means the movie isn't predictable.",8,2,4,17 February 2020
My Neighbor Totoro," Whimsical and Idyllic
",This is the perfect movie for when you're feeling down because the characters are so endearing and the animation is so wonderful that you can't help but wish that you lived in the countryside with Totoro as your neighbour too.,9,0,0,13 February 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," My Favourite Captain America Movie
","I say this is my favourite because it is so well-written and produced that I can't find any flaws in it. They knew what they were doing when they casted Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes because he's phenomenal as The Winter Soldier.He doesn't even speak a full 2 sentences in the entire movie and yet, he's the one that makes this movie work. His eyes are hauntingly beautiful and the way he carries himself as the the programmed Winter Soldier who is at war with the man who was Steve Roger's best friend, Bucky Barnes is nothing short of an Oscar nomination. He's one of the best actors in the industry right now.I rewatch this movie once every few months because it really is THAT good.",9,2,4,4 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Perfect Ending to the Trilogy
","To be honest, this movie was kind of a hot mess, but it was the good kind of hot mess if you know what I mean. The writing was a little clich√©d and I'm surprised that they made Rey x Kylo canon. That was so.. weird although I'm pretty sure the directors justified that by saying that Rey and Kylo always had chemistry between them. I don't know. Anyway, as always, the cinematography is incredible and so is the wonderful and talented cast. I'm really gonna miss the interactions between Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Poe Dameron during the press release. RIP Carrie Fisher.",9,5,23,21 March 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The Best Spiderman Movie!
","In my opinion, this is the best Spiderman movie ever made. The animation is incredible and the team that made this movie happen deserves all the awards and recognition that they got. This movie is visually stunning and I really like the soundtrack as well. Miles Morales as the main character is great. He's just an ordinary teenager until he gets bitten by a radioactive spider, and well. You know what happens next. It's an inspiring story and one that highlights the importance of believing that you can do whatever you endeavour to do. The idea of the multiverse also works amazing in this movie and it was so fun to see all these different Spider characters working together to beat a common enemy.",10,0,2,15 December 2019
Face_Off," Wow!
","This was great and although the surgical procedures seemed kind of unrealistic, who cares? This is a top notch action movie and Travolta and Cage excelled at their roles. Cage moreso than Travolta if I'm being honest, because he had the challenge of having to be more than just a sociopath. The special effects were honestly really good too and they made the stunts look as real as possible.",9,0,1,15 March 2020
Dunkirk," A Great Anti-War Movie
","This movie really works because of its non-linear sequence and the lack of dialogue. It's a movie that's quietly then loudly intense and it shifts between both modes, with Hans Zimmer's brilliant work on the score in the background that provides another layer of underlying tension that keeps you on your toes. Dunkirk is an anti-war movie that shows the human spirit to just Survive, that men who get sent to war are just collateral for a few powerful men who started it all. Dunkirk doesn't get into the politics of things and shows us war in the eyes of regular soldiers and their desperation to live another day.",8,0,5,28 April 2019
The Intouchables," A Memorable Movie
","Untouchable was the first French film I watched and it quickly became one of my favourite movies of all time. It was touching and the friendship these two forged was beautiful to watch; they learned to be better people through knowing each other. Even years later, I still think about Untouchable and re-watch it from time to time. Recently, the American remake of this movie was released and I heard good things about it but I still prefer the original version.",9,0,1,12 July 2019
Spirited Away," Another Beautiful Masterpiece
","I've heard so many good things about this movie and it exceeded all of my expectations. It was a visually stunning and the story was one that emphasised on identity, love and doing the right thing. By the end of the movie, I was feeling nostalgic for some reason and it made me love the movie even more.",10,2,2,30 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," An Epic Conclusion!
","Endgame is the best Avengers movie, hands down, and one of the best Marvel movies so far. Someone who has only watched one or two MCU movies before going to watch Endgame is basically going in blind. You won't find the symbolism of this movie unless you've watched all the previous movies, but especially the Captain America, Iron Man and Thor franchises. Things come full circle in the end and it's an emotional movie.Before watching Endgame, I read many opinions on it and I have to agree that the movie is not uniformly paced. Personally, I like it this way. Some things felt rushed, yes, but it leads to the overall tone of the film; desperation. Things get a little sloppy when you get desperate.Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were amazing, as always, and provided memorable performances, with Tony Stark and Thor providing comic relief from time to time. I love that every Marvel movie finds a balance between humour and action and love. At the end of the day, Endgame's a very human movie that teaches us to do the right thing, even if it hurts us; to fight for the ones we love; and to live without regrets.",10,0,1,4 May 2019
The Pianist," Incredible Acting
","This was probably Brody's best work. I am not a fan of war movies that were directed by Americans because I find that they tend to glorify themselves or romanticise war, or even both. It makes me sick because there are no winners in war, only survivors, the wounded and the dead. The Pianist was difficult to watch at times because there was no embellishment to the drama or violence that unfolded; it was shown as true to life as possible. You could see how bleak the situation seemed and how desperate the people were to just live another day.",8,0,0,12 July 2019
1917," Absolutely Brilliant!
","I've been wanting to watch this movie for so long now and I'm so happy to report that it has exceeded my expectations. I knew that this movie was gonna be good because it got nominated for so many awards and I can see now why it received so much accolade. I know the one-shot thing is a big deal because it is. I mean, it's absolutely insane how they managed to do that! Mad props to the entire team. But the best things about this movie are the writing and cast. Whomever decided to cast George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deserves a freaking raise because these guys are amazing actors. Especially George. I won't spoil anything but my god, the sheer terror and desperation on his face was so believable. And the cinematography is beautiful too, the composition and colours, the symbolism. This movie is one of the best I've seen this year.",10,1,4,12 March 2020
The Imitation Game," Wonderful Film
","Benedict Cumberbatch's performance in this movie is just astounding. I didn't know much about Alan Turing before this movie and I reckon that there's been some embellishments in the movie so I don't know how much of it is the truth, but the cinematography and editing are excellent. This movie just about broke my heart at the end.",9,0,0,30 January 2020
Inception," Nolan is a Genius
","Just rewatched this masterpiece and it's still one of Nolan's best and most creative films. Like who thinks about stuff like this? A dream within a dream within a dream. If I could have even a fraction of Nolan's imagination, I'd be thrilled!There's a sense of completion in watching Nolan's films; you're not left wanting more and you don't think that Nolan shouldn't have added the last 30 minutes. But more importantly, there's a sense of completion in the movie itself, and its complex characters. Nolan's strengths are his amazing character arcs and keeping the story together. Every time I watch a Nolan film, I'm in awe and this is no different.",9,0,1,30 April 2019
Parasite," Unexpected Twists!
","Bong Joon Ho once again delivers a great film with unexpected twists along the way. Parasite is a film about a poor family of four that slowly but surely worms their way into a rich family, by mostly luck and subtle persuasion. The son becomes an English tutor to the rich girl, the daughter becomes an art therapist to the young boy who can't sit still, the father becomes the driver for the successful man of the house and the mother becomes the housekeeper for the rich family.It's a family affair of course and things are well for a while as their employers are none the wiser. Then the old housekeeper comes back and it's revealed that she has been keeping her husband in the basement for about 4 years. Then, well. Things go downhill from there. There are death and murders. Some accidental, some purposeful. But in the end, I think they had a semi-hopeful ending.",9,1,5,29 November 2019
Speed," Intense From Start To End!
","This film is action and intensity from the first scene up to the final scene! This isn't a rollercoaster ride because rollercoaster rides have ups and downs. No, this is one of the best action movies I've watched because it has great pacing and every minute in this movie counts. There are no filler scenes or visible plot holes. Moreover, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock delivered incredible and realistic performances. Kudos to everyone involved in the making of this film because they created an amazing action movie.",8,2,2,30 November 2019
The Replacements," Hilarious Team Of Replacements!
","I thought this would be another one of those serious and dramatic sports movies but I'm so glad that it isn't. I laughed out loud so much that my sibling had to ask me if I was alright. The replacements were a mixed bag of people who only had 4 games to play and they weren't funny individually but together, they were a riot. The dynamics between the team members were so varied, which made this into such a fun movie. Plus, they were united by 2 things in common: they played football and Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves) was an incredible leader. It was so fun to watch these strangers grow close to each other as they gained respect for one another, so they could win the game. And of course the underdogs won!",8,4,4,12 December 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick Just Can't Get A Break
","After the events from the first film, John Wick successfully gets his car back and decides to seal up his guns and suit in his basement. Then he gets called back to the world he worked so hard to leave, by a marker, which is a blood oath to help the person bearing the marker. Wick gets the job done, which would usually mean that he can peacefully retire but the bearer of the marker double crosses him and tries to kill him. This pisses him off, of course and Wick is set onto a path with many challenges and worthy opponents.I find this better than the first film because viewers get to see John Wick in fight scenes where he struggles to have the upper hand and he's being pushed into a corner and he has to kill anyone in his way to get out. We see John Wick getting desperate to survive so he can exact his revenge on the marker bearer who put a hit on him. We see John Wick really angry in this one because he's been royally screwed over, that he stepped into the Continental with the intention to kill, thus breaking one of the cardinal rules of their world: No conducting business on Continental grounds.Keanu Reeves excels during the fight scenes. There's something satisfying about watching John Wick kill all his enemies with accurate shots and calculated moves. Honestly, this movie has some of the best action and fight scenes and viewers won't be disappointed.",9,0,0,30 November 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick Can't Get A Break.
","John Wick buries his suit and guns in his basement and seals them up. Then he gets a visit from a man bearing a marker, forcing him to return to the world he fought so hard to leave. And from there, well. Basically, hits the fan for Wick because the marker-bearing man betrays his word and tries to kill him.I find that this movie's better than the first because we see Wick facing some real challenges such as opponents that match his level of expertise and gives him a run for his money. We see Wick asking for help from people he has tried to kill as help is hard to come by. He's all alone in this world full of people trying to kill him for money.Personally, this movie showed the many dimensions of Wick. He's desperate and being pushed into a corner. Therefore, it's no surprise that he would break a cardinal rule: No business on the Continental.",9,0,0,29 November 2019
Joy," Unexpected Gem
","I haven't watched a movie that Jennifer Lawrence stars in in a good while and I was pleasantly surprised while watching Joy because she was phenomenal in this. Going in, I had no idea who this movie was based on but at the end of it, I did a quick Google search and I can't believe she actually made it, despite all the internal and external challenges that she faced. It was empowering to see her achieve success after being set back so many times and with minimal support.",8,0,0,31 March 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Incredible!
","Everything about Mad Max: Fury Road makes it one of the best action-packed movies. The cast, the insane cinematography and how the movie was edited, and the sheer madness of it all. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are insanely good in this movie and they managed to even make me cry. This movie is a must-watch.",9,1,4,28 April 2019
