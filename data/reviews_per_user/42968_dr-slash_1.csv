Sucker Punch," Surprisingly right
","I've never thought, that a go-go girls action movie can be so right and thought-provoking. Stunning acting from Scott Glenn (Wise Man). He successfully delivers the representations of The Guru that every one of us will might have a chance to meet in this life. Strong 'evil guy' performance from Oscar Isaac (Blue Jones). Thanks, man. Girls... that's a main part. They are gorgeous. This may sound a very sexist, but there's not so many ways to make man to feel a honor to the womankind while wearing anime-like clothes and go-go makeups, but one of them certainly was followed. All the components of the story seems to interact very elaborately and tellingly. Except for a couple of secondaries fight scenes, but they just cannot belittle such a Stephen King's-like flight of imagination.",8,3,6,7 July 2011
