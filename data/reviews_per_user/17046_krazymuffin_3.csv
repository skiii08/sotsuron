Scarface," one of the best movies ever made in cinema, but personally.....
","I'M NOT SAYING THIS MOVIE IS BAD, HECK, IT MIGHT BE YOUR FAVORITEAfter hearing everyone i have met say ' Scarface is one of the best movies' i finally rented it and checked it out. Surprisingly i found the movie not that great. It was a little to 80's (if ya know what i mean), it was pretty damn long and Al Pacino got a bit annoying, 'joo tink joo can tell me hwat to do?!?!'. Usually people who listen to rap music find this movie pretty entertaining (probably because of the violence) but i bet if you really asked them a question about the movie (why was tony so determined to make it in America? why was he so power hungry?) they wouldn't be able to think of an answer.I'm not saying this movie is bad, heck, it could be your favorite movie,i'm just saying that if you're a person like me then just check it out, it might be your new favorite movie. Al Pacino makes the role seem realistic (thats how good he is) and De Palma did a great job directing. I hope you found this comment useful and if you're a person who likes the movie then don't get upset by this comment, we all have different perspectives of what a 'good movie' is.enjoy scarface",7,0,1,17 July 2007
Apocalypse Now," To Much Genius to Handle
","I'm a 16 yr old teenager and i gotta say that this movie straight out fried my brains. Someone told me that this movie was said to be the most realistic thing to the Vietnam War and i can understand why. The madness of it all just scars you, it makes you really think. The chaos is to much for the mind. After i watched this movie i just sat there in silence and thought '..........woah........'. This is film-making outside the box. Martin Sheen is brilliant and takes us on the journey with him, the boat crew is great each of them is an individual, Marlon Brando is just mind-blowing, scared me to death, I was left in suspense every scene in case he had another outburst of rage.This isn't a movie where you say to yourself 'i need to kill some time, so i'll watch it', this isn't a movie to watch with a bunch of friends (maybe if you're high). No. You really have to prepare yourself for this. Before you watch this movie, set up some snacks, drinks, sit back and observe the pure experience that is Apocalypse Now and watch as you experience a trip so intense that afterward's you won't be able to think straight for the next hour.Enjoy",10,6,9,27 November 2008
Platoon," By far the best war movie ever made
","I am 15 and not a big fan of war movies because of mainly the violence and gore and lack of emotion. this movie is one of the greatest movies ever made and it's the most perfect war movie because: it shows both a 'sensitive side to war' and a 'violent side of war', it's not to gory yet it has a lot of action, all the characters make you believe you're amongst them and the movie shows that war can emotionally cripple a man let alone physically. willem defoe and tom berenger are so awesome and played there characters so well that you might of thought that you were there with them.seriously if you're a student or an adult (it doesn't matter) see this movie, i %100 believe that you will not be disappointed. rent it, buy it whatever!! just see it.",10,5,7,17 July 2007
