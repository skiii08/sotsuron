Requiem for a Dream," Should have been an MTV reality show...
","*Spoiler ahead* Though, personally, I consider it a saver.This film was so close to brilliance that it's failure made it immensely disappointing, the least grievous offense of all being its predictability.
If you are going to do a tradgedy flick about drug use, box office trends dictate that all main characters must have high cheekbones and decorate everything as if in a 70's flashback. Throw in a few extra body mutilations and you've got yourself a classic dark comedy. Sadly, I think the world just isn't quite ready for the culture comedy yet and I have to appreicate the director's <selling> sensibility </out>.Requiem for a Dream is a superbly overrated film.  This was somebody's attempt to make a movie out of a drug awareness poster.  Boy does drugs. Boy is mean to mom.  Boy meets girl.  Boy and girl do drugs.  Mom does drugs.  Everybody does drugs.  People start losing limbs, getting electrocuted, or ending up putting unspeakable objects into their orifices; all in the name of... Â©Art.  Oh, so dark and daring.I felt like I was watching some MTV reality show, made even more 'real' with trendy editing and sound bites.  Uh huh. Really on the edge, deep material we're talking about.  Had there been one shred of entertainment value, perhaps I could forgive just a little.  In the end, I was most offended by the film's one and only intended success: I came away mildy depressed.",1,8,16,6 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Don't bother watching unless you read the book.
","***SPOILERS AHEAD***
There are two reasons to not watch this movie unless you have read the book: one is that it will bore the heck out of you, and the other is that you might really like it but have spoiled the read, not becoming acquainted with the full storyline by reading the book first.  Personally, I read the book (er,trilogy) first. For many Tolkien fans, all this movie had to do was not suck.  Tolkien fans have been robbed of a good cinematic interpretation of the book for so long that giving the TLOR in film was like giving  a starving man a cracker.
I waited until my 24th birthday to go and see this film and would get upset at my friends if any of them tried to tell me their opinion of the movie before I had seen it.  It was very important to me that I have NO expectations.  I did not want to be disappointed.  Well, I wasn't.  From the opening narrative I was enthralled.  I now believe this film was executed towards one primary purpose: to make the Tolkien fans happy.  Every detail and scene was inspired by original illustrations of the many artists who have painted or drawn scenes from TLOR over the decades.  Rivendell was so perfectly portrayed it actually brought tears to my eyes (and I'm no crybaby).  I was actually overcome with emotion at really seeing what my mind's eye had seen for so long.  I think many viewers, myself included, had the feeling that this film BELONGED to them.  This film was cast,scored and directed long before Jackson ever put his hands on it.  This was MY film. Jackson did a good job of not getting in the way of MY film too much.Obviously I am making an argument for the emotional reasons that many enjoyed this film.  On the other side, I completely understand how somebody who never read the book would find it boring.  It has been long enough since I went to see the film that I can be objective and look at the flaws.
In fact, there were a few flaws I found while watching it, and I'll mention those first.  Elijah Wood, in my opinion, was not hobbitish at all.  I never thought of hobbits as boyish and undeveloped-even if they are young in age as Frodo was.  Dudley Moore is really the only hobbit-type who comes to mind right now.  I admit Sean Austin did have that perfect affability a hobbit should have, but he too was not quite right.  I don't recall who played Bilbo, but he was MUCH better (and provocative I might add).  The main gripe I have about the hobbits was their makeup.  It is obvious that they were made to look much more human than they actually were written to be. Hobbits are not dainty and hairless!  Capturing the look of a hobbit was missed in the film, and unfortunately, was a major flaw.  The original book WAS titled The Hobbit, after all.My next gripe is about the battle scenes.  While some have commented on how good they were, I found them tiresome due to the weird camera angles and overdone graphics.  The only battle scene I appreciated was the unoriginal, though wonderfully epic, battle in which what's-his-name chops the hand off of the big bad ugly dude.This leads me on to my next point: none of the monsters seemed that scary and were almost all way overdone.  I felt at times that I was being catapulted back into an early 80's flashback of Iron Maiden and other cheese heavy metal bands album covers.  Or was it a WWF lineup for Halloween? The music was also a bit obvious.  I am sure we all like our Enya when we take our bubblebaths, but I thought the artist's familiarity detracted from the originality of the rest of the film. I like Enya, but this song was weak and went nowhere.   Whatever happened to the Led Zeppelin or even the Jethro Tull era of music-the time when TLOR was at the height of its popularity? Enya seemed the Celine Dion of fantasy cinema, and I don't mean in a good way (I pray I'm safe here in assuming any self-respecting Tolkien fan steers clear of Celine).    Her music and even the original score were just a wee bit overdone, me thinks.  There were certain scenes when I wondered if the music could get any louder.On to my favorite scenes in the film.  Hobbiton was executed with perfection.  I'm only sorry there wasn't more film time for it, but hopefully in the sequel.  The only qualm I had was the Bilbo's hobbit hole was not quite as lavish as described in the book, and I would have enjoyed the eye candy (that is, after all, what this film essentially was about). The guy who played Gandalf was superp, and I know others will hate me for bringing Hollywood names into it, but I'd have really liked to see Sean Connery as Sauron and Anthony Hopkins as Gandalf.  Still, they were both played wonderfully and my favorite scene was when they first met in Sauron's castle.  I thought Rivendell was fabulous, but again, the elves also looked too human! The flight scene with Arwen was good and Liv Tyler was well-cast, and the languages of the elves was absolutely perfect.  I have actually studied the languages and could see they did have to improvise since it was never really a complete language to begin with, and it was done beautifully.
Objectively, I can see how somebody who has not read the book would find the movie a total bore.  In fact I know I would have not made it through three hours.  But having read the book, I was wishing the movie was 30 hours long! I liked the movie for emotional reasons, and though that doesn't make me a fair critic, I hope the movie's success will continue to encourage people to go and read the trilogy to understand what everyone was talking about.Despite the film's obvious flaws and lack of appeal to newbies, I still have to give this film 9 out of 10 stars due to it's visual and fan-pleasing integrity-which is practically unheard of with books-turned-movie.  I might buy a larger television just to watch it when it comes out on DVD.",10,1,1,20 April 2002
Coyote Ugly," Something to pick your nose to...
","If you like movies like Maid In Manhattan and Charlie's Angels, you'll LOVE this little gem. If you're over the age of 15, have above room temperature IQ, and are mentally stable, my advice is to not waste your time on this offensively trite piece of trash.",1,0,2,4 April 2003
Groundhog Day," Clever, funny masterpiece
","Comedies that can also convey sentiment are hard to find.  Good ones, that is.  This is a very funny movie. I have watched it several times and appreciate something new with each viewing.  Basically, it's about a guy named Phil (played by Billy Murray) reliving the same day over and over again. His romantic interest, played by Andie McDowell, represents a brick wall he keeps smashing himself against  until  figuring out that he has to be happy with himself and what he has instead of what he wants.  I usually can't stand 'feel good' movies, but this movie is  touching.  A man nobody likes ends up epitomizing all the things that make a person good. 
Many people feel like they are living the same day over and over again, and in relating to Phil's self-inflicted plight, they laugh out loud at his frustrations and misery.  In truth, many people are living the same day over and over again because, like the main character, they make the same mistakes over and over again.   What makes it so interesting is how it exposes the problems-and hilarity of such problems- that a lot of men have.  Phil learns to appreciate what IS. He learns that if another person can be 'conquered' that they weren't worth conquering to begin with; that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  True happiness comes from within.  Blah, blah, blah and so forth. I can't imagine the film with anyone other than Murray. With miraculous insight, he exploits the introspective, narcissistic humor of the story. The two work brilliantly together, exposing an ironic, self deprecating charm before it's over.",Null,0,0,13 September 2003
Donnie Darko," Spoilers ahead.
","Jake Gyllenhaal.  Wow.  Not just for his acting, but for his provocative appeal and natural screen presence.  This is somebody I hope to see a lot more of.  Maggie Gyllenhaal gave a strong performance and I am not surprised to discover the two are siblings as the onscreen chemistry was excellent between them.  Beth Grant, who played Kitty Farmer (The neurotic dance team's coach) was also excellent.  Noah Wylie is always fun to watch. Though I was totally unconvinced by Drew Barrymore's short cameo, I was impressed that she co-produced the film.   Based upon the stupid evil bunny ad and lame title, I would never have rented it if it weren't so well ranked on IMDB.  When I rented Donnie Darko, I had no idea what kind of genre the movie was in. The opening scene of Donnie Darko didn't really help either, but I knew this was going to be a good movie when the first song of the score played.  I thought the choice in songs was excelllent (though overplayed at times) and added to the underlying sense of melancholic anxiety and euphoria of the film; a rare talent in filmmakers, save a very select few (as in David Lynch per Angelo Badallamenti).  I don't think the direction of the film was meant to actually go a specific place.  What makes the film good is how it leaves interpretation up to the viewer.  I think any good psychological thriller leaves plenty to the imagination (er, psyche).There was, of course, some very obvious foreshadowing and explicit symbolism.  When Donnie Darko had a talk with Prof. Monnitoff (Noah Wyle), they had to stop talking when fate and god became the topic.  This movie, on a more obvious level, was about Donnie CHOOSING to accept his fate and follow the path of god.  I gave 8/10 stars.  I am very hard to please.  I would watch the movie again.  I thought the use of Echo and the Bunnymen was particularly silly and clever and have to go buy their record now.",8,0,0,8 August 2003
