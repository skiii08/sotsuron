Skyfall," D for Disappointment
","I don't know if I can add anything more than what has been said on the previous 105 pages, but here goes: When I heard what a high-grossing movie this was, I thought, 'Great, they have moved beyond Quantum of Solace and emulated Casino Royale and other great Bond films.' My son saw it before me and said he only liked the last 1/3rd of the movie, the first 2/3rds was too slow and dull. That didn't stop me because I usually disagree with him, and I still do, but only because it seemed the whole movie was rather dull except the opening sequence. And the opening showing him shot, plunging down a waterfall left me wondering not just how he survived but why did he remain unavailable and not report back immediately? The film makes it look as though he would have been out of touch permanently except his conscience bothered him when he saw the attack on MI6 HQ. I can understand re-using some story lines but wasn't the rogue/traitor agent also used in QoS, the previous Bond film? In The World is Not Enough, M was also targeted, but when she was imprisoned she rigged a clock to a nuclear locating device to get help. That plot device works well for characters put in situations that they have no control over; however, in this film, why would Bond take M to a secluded house with no back-up of any kind, just jerry-rigged devices? Couldn't Q have given them some kind of assistance? These plot holes go on and on. Funny, though, I did not remember any plot holes in the previous two movies but this one is full of them and I was not amused. IMHO, this movie could make View to a Kill look good.",6,3,9,25 December 2012
No Country for Old Men," The Academy Duped Again
","4 Academy Awards, Come On?!?! I admit there was some good acting and good cinematography but the rest was a total disappointment. It was not a modern day Western as I was led to believe: it was a farce. Here are some things I found farcical: the deputy leaves the prisoner handcuffed with hands in from of him. Was there no cell to put him in? The hunter has a pang of conscience and returns to 'drug deal gone bad' scene with some water for one of dying dealers. There was no explanation of why the deal went wrong in the first place; obviously the two parties each brought their goods. Why didn't the hunter just call the police/sheriff from a payphone and say he saw a scene of carnage in the desert instead of taking a dying man water in a jug? After the deputy was killed, why wasn't there a manhunt out for the killer? The sheriff seemed to dwell on his retirement more than stopping the carnage. Where were the Texas Rangers in all of this? If the sheriff was overwhelmed, why didn't he call for help? Did no one in Texas carry a gun other than the killer? Well you get the picture: gross carnage, how many people can we kill in a 2 hour movie, etc. Glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater.",3,3,5,19 July 2019
The Dark Knight," A great but flawed masterpiece
","I saw the movie with my wife and interestingly while she is the comic book buff, I thought it was a great movie and she hated it. When I asked her why, she felt the movie Batman was not true to the character of the comic book Batman. Her example was in the simultaneous capture of the DA and girlfriend. The comic Batman would have managed to somehow save both of them but in the movie, one dies and perhaps the other should have died. I attributed that to perhaps a more true-to-life situation of not being able to save everyone, every time, but her comments did make me rethink some of the movie. The parts I found unbelievable is how the Joker could manage to surreptitiously plant a ton of explosives not only throughout a major medical center but also in two large ferries. And I am the only one who thinks Gotham City should be New York, not Chicago? The other irritating thing was - at least in my theater - the music drowned out the dialog. I had a very hard time hearing critical parts of what the characters were saying. So, in summary, while it was a great movie and I recommend it highly, I also wish there could have been less explosions and less background music.",8,1,5,27 July 2008
Casino," The rise and fall of the Vegas I knew and loved
","If nothing else, this film answers the question of what happened to the Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s that most of us experienced and loved. Ace makes the correct statement that now Vegas is the another DisneyWorld where you can take the whole family to be entertained. I remember when it was a little more adult entertainment - a great floor show, 99 cent T-bone dinners, and reasonably priced rooms - all subsidized by gambling. But what about the movie itself?... While watching the movie, I was reminded of a Saturday Night Live skit called 'Low Class Italian Theater' presumably based on the film Raging Bull. The skit satirized movies with Italian men using the f-- word and accusing each other of sleeping with each other's wives. While I think this is one of Martin Scorsese's best films with superb acting by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone, I can't help but feel it is a little flawed by the constant verbal assault which is not totally germane to the movie. In fact, I heard more anti-Semitic remarks in this one movie than in my entire life. Furthermore, while Sharon Stone's acting was nothing short of brilliant, I think the pace of the movie could have progressed faster and the movie shortened if they had cut out much of her neurotic screwed-up wife routine. I also feel there was an audio assault with the excessive soundtracks. The acting and story line really spoke for itself and did not need every song that was added for dramatic emphasis. Nevertheless, in spite of these alleged shortcomings, I loved the movie and felt I was actually looking at a newsreel from 1973; it seemed that realistic. As mentioned before, the acting was superb and I can't believe there were not more Oscars won here. The fact that it was based on a true story only adds to its aura of a great film. Watch it when you have three hours to spare!",8,1,1,29 June 2007
