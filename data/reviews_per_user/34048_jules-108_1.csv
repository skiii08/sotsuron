The Blair Witch Project," Scary, but not as scary as 'Darklands'!
","Like Cube, Blair Witch is a superb example of how to get the best result out of very limited resources. And in the horror genre, in the post Scream, satirical 90's, this is a tough challenge to pull off. Nevertheless, I have recently seen a British horror film about devil worship and witchcraft which makes Blair Witch look like a picnic in the forest. It's called 'Darklands' and is a must see for any full tilt fright",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
