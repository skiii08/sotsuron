The Avengers," one of the best movies of 2012 and ever
","this movie is epic. the actors did an amazing job on all there scenes but i walked out of the theater satisfied and wondering where the mcu would go, with thanos and the infinity jems. this movie isn't flawless but it isn't horrible either. the action is awesome especially during the battle of new york. the humor is put into the movie in a way where its almost a comedy. they put easter eggs into the movie that hinted future movies. and the shwarma scene is just awesome. but on the other hand there are some bad things about it. i would have liked to see more heroes and some of the heroes to have been seen on screen for more than 1 movie. i felt like we were literally just starting a movie franchise and now we are teaming up. this movie hints many things but the biggest 2 are civil war(captain America fighting with iron man/Thor captain America iron man fight) and infinity war(thanos, infinity stone/gems). this movie finishes phase 1 with a bang and gets phase 2 off to a great start.",7,2,5,27 April 2015
Iron Man 3," a OK start to phase 2 but starts the formation of avengers 2
","iron man returns for his own solo film for the third and worst time. this movie mixes up so many comics that you don't know what its based off of. the kid is not necessary along with that small town in Tennessee. it shows that iron man 'created his own demons' years ago and that he is scared from the battle of new york. he looses his house, suits, arc reactor, and fortune in this movie. this is interesting because with out the arc reactor how is the suit powered? I'm not going to answer that here, but he doesn't get rid of the reactor. the villain, although not from a direct comic, is pretty cool besides that weird Mandarin whose just an actor. also, this is the only movie (so far) that has iron man without ACDC! i thought that the back story was interesting and that overall the did an OK job. also, Bruce banner appears in the end credit scene. its not hinting anything, but still cool end credit scene. overall OK movie, great cast, cant wait for age of ultron.",7,1,3,27 April 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," this is basically the prequel to age of ultron
","awesomely insane great movie. captain America appears in Washington D.C working for shield 2 years after the battle for new york. the action is insane and the actors do even better. Chris evens does, in my opinion, his best acting as a superhero. his list is right on with what he missed and he should have helped take home a few Oscars. scarlet Johanson does excellent as black widow and is even more mysterious than her last 2 appearances. her back story is also almost entirely revealed. falcon appears for the first time and looks pretty cool. nick fury dies but doesn't really. maria hill does a good job on her missions and is great as fury's co worker at this point. agent pierce is hydra and the head of shield after fury 'dies.' this changed everything even though agent colsin started making shield from the ground up in agents of shield. the conspiracies really make the movie and the basic confirmation of doctor strange to enter the mcu. D.C is a awesome location for Steve rogers to take down hydra and shield. the winter soldier is awesome but he obviously should look older because he has been ruining around for 72 years. overall great movie and prequel to age of ultron.",8,2,5,27 April 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," amazing movie cant wait for the sequel
","this is an epic movie with lots of humor, action, and great acting. but 1 thing- this and most of the great marvel movies follow a basic structure and make multiple movies with it. i.e Capitan America 2,guardians, avengers. but besides that great job marvel this is in the top 3 movies they ever have made. it has such a great cast of characters. star lord a outlaw formerly part of the ravagers born on earth but is part something ancient. gamora is a green killing machine from a planet thanos destroyed and an 'adopted' daughter of thanos who tries to retrieve the orb. rocket a experiment gone wrong is a feisty little guy with a big gun with him almost always. Groot a tree who can only say i am Groot exclusively in that order. drax a mad man ronnan killed his family so drax wants to kill him. in my opinion drax is not a good member of the team until the end. he just does so many what the heck things throughout the movie. and thats why its only a 9 of 10.",7,1,5,28 April 2015
La La Land," One of The Best Movies Ever Made
","La La Land is one of the greatest movies of 2016. It has career defining performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, the highlight being Stone. The Cinematography and Music are the other two highlights both being some of the best of the past decade. The movie is a great homage to old musicals like Signin' In The Rain and does this extremely well, opening with things like cinema scope and technicolor. In addition, the dancing has some of the best choreography for dancing in a movie since movies like Signin' in The Rain. It should get nominated for best cinematography, best picture, best actress, best director, best production design, best actor, best original song and best original score. 10/10 go see it now.",10,7,11,22 December 2016
Thor: The Dark World," better than the first great acting, locations, and what?!?
",so in Thor the dark world the dark elves lead by malekith want to take over the 9 realms with an infinity stone known as the ether. the location on earth primarily england provides a different view on the world and that the world knows about Thor and most likely the other avengers. tom hiddleston and Chris hemesworth do a awesome job as brother-brother. Loki's mind tricks are also seen a lot more. hemdal is just amazing taking down that INVISIBLE plane. Odin is helpful in explaining what are the infinity stones and who are the dark elves. but hold on a second what happened to Odin. Loki's now on the thrown of Asgard and lucky for him hemdal hasn't alerted Thor who is now living on earth with Jane. the collector also makes a post credit appearance and so does Adam warlock in his cocoon. the collector wants the infinity stones so that thanos wont destroy the universe and all the interesting life. it confused me until i saw it the second time and saw how great this movie is.,7,0,1,27 April 2015
