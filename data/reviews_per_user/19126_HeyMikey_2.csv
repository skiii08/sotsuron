Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Controversy aside: a little something after the credits
","For the time being, I'm going to stay out of the liked versus didn't like controversy surrounding SW Episode I.  I'll reserve my opinion for a later date.  I did want to mention one thing about the ending credits that was chilling.After all the ending credits are done rolling, if you pay attention to the music, you can hear shades of Darth Vader's theme superimposed over the sound of Darth Vader's breathing.  It's eerie.P.S. This is my first movie comment in IMDb...",7,0,0,11 June 1999
Con Air," Dark comedy or action thriller?
","Floor wax or dessert topping?Relax, it's both. After watching an excruciating first 30 minutes of the movie anticipating a decent, mindless action flick, I came to realize that the movie makers hadn't intended it to have a believable story line nor three-dimensional characters. Nope. What I got from the movie was so much better: Jerry Bruckheimer was shooting a comedy, carefully wrapped up in a blast-fest package.Once I realized that, my opinion of the movie changed.Like other IMDB contributors, I thought Cage's drawl was silly. I also thought casting Cusack, a great actor, as an unlikely action hero was weak (driving alone to meet a plane full of vicious convicts, armed with only a pistol?). Yes, the plot was filled with more holes than a Beverly Hills golf-course. Yes, the story was predictable and the dialogue unbelievable. Yes, great talent was wasted (Cage, Cusack, Malkovich). But, I have to admit, the movie was good for a few yucks and a lot of adrenaline rush. I also enjoyed Malkovich's performance as an intellectually-advanced, morally-stunted psychopath.Before I realized it was a comedy, I would have given the movie a 2 or 3. But now, armed with this knowledge, I give it a 5/10.",5,0,0,11 March 2002
