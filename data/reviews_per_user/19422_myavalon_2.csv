Casablanca," You played it for her, you can play it for me
","At this point, Casablanca is so universally beloved that it's almost not worth giving it a positive review. But how can I not? Not only is it brilliant on almost every level (except the feminist one-'You'll have to do the thinking for both of us'), but it was the film that first made me into a movie geek. At the end, when Bogie gives up Bergman for the sake of the war, I was just completely stunned. Movies were allowed to end that way? I suddenly realized how much potential there was in the art of the moving picture. It also started my great love affair with Humphrey Bogart. Not conventionally handsome, still he can induce swoons with one heartbroken look.",10,1,3,12 June 2006
The Dirty Dozen," Rooting for the Bad Guys
","As a post-Vietnam, post-9/11, mid-Iraq female, I really shouldn't like this movie. I guess I'm supposed to prefer sensitive, emotional dramas where people resolve their differences through peaceful means. I should be appalled by the brutality and savagery displayed in this 'guy movie.' Yeah. Sure.Come on! It has everything going for it- a great cast, biting dialouge, adrenaline-charged action, not to mention Charles Bronson, a personal crush of mine.They may be bad guys (except for Bronson and Brown, who seem to have been justified in committing their crimes), but you just have to cheer them on.",10,1,4,3 June 2006
