Black Swan," Absolutely Rubbish !! Totally Over Rated !!
","The Oscars mean nothing ! awards mean nothing !whats wrong with people nowadays. have you not seen any good film? soo much rubbish all the time, no wonder you don't know whats good. forget the critics, forget the Oscars and awards, and forget the opinions of others. Hollywood can sell any rubbish film! this is unbelievable! i actually went to cinema to watch this crap, but i had already seen everything else so i had no choice. i sat right at the back near the middle and i should have left, but i waited for a friend so i stayed. from now on i'm only gonna watch comedy in cinema, that way i know the fill is likely to be rubbish but the cheap laughs will be worth it. This and The Kings Speech should not be mentioned as good films, they are both pretty crap and no-one should talk about em. after watching this film and seeing the trailers again and again, i wanted to shoot someone. Once this crap film is out of the cinema and onto DVD it will be forgotten like all the other crap Hollywood sells. i want to give all the people who gave this film a negative review what it fully deserves a round of applause and all the others who cant think for themselves 'shame on you'",1,10,17,12 April 2011
Requiem for a Dream," Very Disturbing !! and Weird !!
","I saw this film with high expectations and didn't know what to think at the end.The film is very graphic and very disturbing.You either love it or you hate it and i must admit i hate it.However there were a few good scenes but they became weird.The soundtrack for the film is great it goes with the film.Obviously your gonna wanna watch this film if you haven't seen it and you'v read all the good reviews and comments but try to forget them and watch it with no expectations and when your really in the mood.This film is as weird as eternal sunshine of the spotless mind which in my mind makes them both missable films and not to be bought or rented.I RECENTLY WATCHED THE FILM AGAIN AND I LIKED IT, MARLON WAYANS WAS BRILLIANT AND ALL THE OTHER CAST WERE GOOD AS USUAL !!",8,3,6,30 June 2006
LÃ©on: The Professional," Absolutely Fantastic !!!!
",The cast is top class and every character sticks in your head.........Action all the way through with some emotional bits...........Good soundtrack too........ the main one you remember is sting 'shape of my heart'but you'll notice another sung by bjork called 'Venus as a boy'........You got too see this film.......... you'll definitely recommend it to friends......this is 'The greatest Hit-man film of all time'.............Luc Bessons best...........Just go watch it...........,10,3,6,27 November 2005
Rocky," Absolutely Fantastic !!!! All 5 are great !!!
",Stallone pulls it off again....... what a great actor........ definitely the best actor in the world!!!!!!!!Definitely the greatest collection of boxing films............ easily better than raging bull which was good.........I watched the first one and thought how the hell is Stallone gonna top this then i watched the second one and it was remarkable and then i watched them all and just thought incredible each one is brilliant.......They are all completely different in stories and fighting scenes.......Stallone is definitely under rated........... Most of his films are great for eg...... 1 - Rambo 1-3 (all fantastic number 1 especially) 2 - Lock UP (Fantastic film which is rarely talked about as the media try to brush it under the carpet) 3 - Tango and cash (What a partnership) 4 - Get Carter (Incredible Remake)Obviously Stallone has a few crap movies but it was gonna be crap from the word go.......For instance 'Death Race 2000' what a crap story.........Anyway bottom line is 'Stallone' is a great actor not like by the media and Hollywood at times because he stays away from Hollywood and they cant think of what to write..............Stallone if you happen to read this one day.......... Email me at imay_37@hotmail.com......... I have a few scripts which i would like you to take to the next level........,10,1,3,2 December 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Over - Rated!!!
","You got to be honest to yourself, just because the first 2 are brilliant that doesn;t make this great....Compared to the first two which kept you on the edge of your seat, with action and story balanced perfectly, number 3 is just a dull story that could be told way less than 3 hours.As far as i'm concerned there is no godfather trilogy, just 1 and 2.When you have seen the first 2 you're gonna wanna watch the 3rd, just make sure you watch it when you have nothing else you could watch.Over - all its a rubbish film and for some reason no'one wants to be honest about it.....Although the last half an hour did try to push the film up 3/10, the 2 hours before was useless......",1,4,12,4 March 2006
Casino Royale," You Got To Be Kidding Me !!
","okay! okay! i might hav got this one wrong, i watched it again recently on DVD and its not as bad as i first thought, its actually pretty good well it held my attention anyway. sometimes you got to watch a film more than once to make sure you agree with your first though!C'mon guys............This film is crap, in the same league as the awful Miami vice.......Daniel craig was always gonna be a great bond - Layer Cake was good.But this script is rubbish, abit of action a lot of poker like watching late night poker - (no offence to poker fans) but the only reason some people like this film is because they enjoy poker and gambling.You cant have a poker match in a film, its not on.OK! you get abit of action and romance buy yeah ! yeah !... big deal...The problem is, bond fans and people who claim to have pride because its a British franchise rate the film high........... ........we'r all adults here, lets act like it....Your exercise for today is think before you reply or comment !!I'v seen great/good films and predictable crap !! but you got to compare films to the greats/good for them to be classed as greats/good....I suggest you watch a good film for example off the top of my head, say, ..........GOODFELLAS or COLLATERAL and then watch this........Always be truthful, say what you feel and ALWAYs DO THE RIGHT THING!!",7,6,10,7 December 2006
