Captain Phillips," Great story, great acting, but camera too shaky throughout
","What a great story with plenty of character development and action. There was some nice detail on various aspects of the different ships involved in the movie which made it feel like you were really there. As other reviewers have noted, the director used the over-done Blair Witch camera shake throughout, which is why I gave it a 3 instead of 9 stars. Every single one of the actors playing the Somali pirates did an exceptional job. Great job of casting, too. Tom Hanks gave an excellent performance, except for his accent which drifted around throughout the movie. His performance in the final 10 minutes of the movie is just incredible.As the writer J. Michael Straczynksi once said, the two keys to a good story are to create characters your audience cares about and have interesting things happen to them. This movie has plenty of both.",3,3,7,2 February 2014
The Hurt Locker," Good story, bad editing
","The story is engaging and provides what is probably a much-closer-to-reality view of what war in Iraq was like than typical action movies. Even the gunfire and explosions are different (and presumably real) enough from traditional movies that they somehow feel real - and like many aspects of the movie quickly deliver that 'oh....so that's what it must really be like....wow' moment.Unfortunately, the director over-used the Blair-Witch / Bourne 'Let's shake the camera a lot through the whole movie' technique to where I was constantly distracted and pulled away from the more intense emotional drama of what really can go on in war. I almost shut the movie off half-way through because it was so bad. If they released a non-shaky version of the movie I'd give it 7 or 8 stars, but as edited, I wouldn't recommend it and would barely give it 3 stars.",3,1,1,16 October 2013
300," Mostly blood and guts with a little dialog thrown in
","It's rare for me to see a movie who's IMDb.com voting average is over 7.0, and not love it. With reviews averaging 8.0, and both my teenage girls loving it (they saw 300 before me), I thought it would be great - maybe a some interesting history, maybe some great characters, or plot. But nope - just 2 hours of gratuitous blood and guts. And I do mean blood and guts.Gerard Butler did a good job of acting at King Leonidis, but the way the story is put together and presented, when he shouts that they are fighting for freedom, it could have been anything - fighting for gold, or fighting for glory. It didn't seem to matter. Some of the special effects are well done - the enormity of the armies and the scenery. If you like blood and guts, this too was well done.Technically, I didn't care for the color rendering. It looked like the whole film was adjusted in photoshop to be half-way between true color and sepia, maybe to give it an old-time feel.",1,4,10,8 April 2007
