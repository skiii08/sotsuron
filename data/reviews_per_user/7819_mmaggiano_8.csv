Blade Runner 2049," Visually perfect, but not quite a new classic
","Having seen the film twice, I'm amazed by the cinematography. One would be hard put to find a single bad shot in the film, and the editing is unobtrusive. I found the long, slow, contemplative nature of much of the movie to be very fitting, and even exhilarating in the sense that it wasn't rapid-cutting superhero trash.Unfortunately, there are also a few flaws. The narrative has some carelessly convenient jump-aheads, and some plot holes or story logic problems. At this point this is a consistent pattern with Denis Villeneuve- staggering visuals and narrative stumbles. Second, the sound design has been compromised by a BRRRONNNGG noise that plays through quite a few scenes and feels like a cheap manipulation.",7,3,11,18 October 2017
The Revenant," Endurance, Cinematography... and Zero for Story
","The Revenant's story is flat and difficult to accept as realistic or mythic. It may be magic realism but that doesn't make this particular story an effective narrative- its strengths lie in the visual trip it takes you on. However, what story it does have ruins that visual trip, unlike in the best works of Malick or Tarkovsky, where the natural imagery and the dreaminess better compliment the narrative, and vice-versa.It's not realistic, despite being 'based' on a true story, because it keeps the main character alive past all biological possibility. (For those who would quibble with the 'true story' factor, the actual story of Hugh Glass doesn't have the main character defy death ten times over. Furthermore it's a 'true story' of a mountain man doing something extraordinary. This usually means it's a tall tale.)And if Glass' death-defiance is meant to subtly show the main character as a kind of undead or supernatural being (or ambiguously or liminally so), that idea is not developed interestingly. Even worse, if Glass' endurance and death-defiance are supernatural, then his determination is irrelevant and the theme seems to be: 'family love powers magic revenge'. That's an F for story to me. I suppose that there could be some sort of grand allegorical meaning, but since the story doesn't work on the literal level, that potential is irrelevant to me.Although others may see it differently, the highest score I can give a narrative film with a zero for story is a 3 out of 10. I find it sadly amusing that after Birdman, with its examination of the perils of ego, Inarritu follows with an egomaniacal stunt of his own.",3,13,29,10 January 2016
Gone Girl," Plenty to discuss, yet difficult to rate
","This is a difficult movie to rate because its strengths and weaknesses are tangled together. I have not read the book, and I'm reviewing the film as its own entity.The movie's worth seeing, if only because of the twists, the character of Amy, and the post-movie talking points that are meant to provoke a battle of the sexes debate.I did enjoy Fincher branching out in a new direction, and I wouldn't say that it's the wrong direction for him as much as it was a difficult tone to hit for anyone. The movie sets out to mix melodrama, realistic satire and absurdism. Though I love weird tones and shifting tones, to me the tones in Gone Girl don't always land well or mix well.Worse still, there's inconsistent acting, and wobbly story logic. The movie isn't deliberately unreal enough (whether absurd or dreamlike or mythic or farcical etc) to get away with the wobbly story logic.I'm not sure the actors are always successful at staying in the same movie together. And Affleck (as A-lister personality actors often do) seems to be so intent on 'playing a character with a backbone' that it's basically frigid, unflinching acting where his 'character' doesn't really change or have an interior. We're left watching Affleck bring the role to himself so entirely that he's not really doing anything. It's just flat acting that has about the same tone all the way through. (And it's not unlike the frigidity that Casey Affleck has in Gone Baby Gone, directed by Ben Affleck) I think this is partly dismissible by the character's degree of narcissism and shallowness, but not entirely.ButÂ… I have toyed around with the idea that Fincher and Flynn are jazzing around metafictionally here. I'm not convinced that they are, or that they did it well if intended. But at some point, two intelligent artists may have discussed how a man is to direct a woman's novel/screenplay of this sort.IF they baked a metafiction joke into it, the setup clearly runs through Affleck's under-emoting, under-engaged acting that undermines the story, and through the way that nearly every story logic problem serves to make Amy more amazing. And the meta-joke, if there is one, only plays if you see the characters as puppets, more or less: The psychopathically overengaged, self-justified modern wife who gets to always be right, and the self-centered, resentful boy-husband who takes her just barely seriously enough to subtly manipulate back and stay alive.Yet... I'm not sure I want to give Affleck the benefit of the doubt that his practically unchanging tone and lack of interior were all just a brilliant meta-joke.",6,2,27,6 October 2014
La La Land," Fundamental problems with conflict and story logic. Music is hit or miss. Tons of motion blur.
","In Whiplash, Chazelle's first feature, excellent cinematography, editing, music and design combined with great acting and gripping scenes. However, it was marred by some serious disconnects with realism while purporting to be essentially realistic: some of the character psychologies and story logic were stretched too thin. Ultimately, one could enjoy the acting and the edit/shot rhythms, and forgive the flaws.Those same flaws from his first picture absolutely devastate La La Land, and they aren't counterbalanced by much more than two very good set pieces (Gosling and Stone's number while he walks her to her car, and Stone's audition number).There is not an interesting conflict in a scene for the first ninety minutes of this movie. Much of the early tension is based on two good-looking 'characters' who 'don't like each other', and on them coincidentally running into each other a few times. ALL of the later conflict between the two main characters hinges on conveniently concocted scene logic that boils down to fighting and breaking up instead of simple solutions like a) sending a text or b) getting out of a work thing or c) saying 'I'll see you in a few months'. The logic flaws and wholly unearned story points are so bad that it's not really a story; it's more of a unpolished frame to hang a bunch of set pieces on. It intends to be a string of pearls.But when half of those set pieces are mediocre, particularly the opening number, one is left with uncomfortable waits between the good parts: the story and characters are nothing, and half of the scenes neither deepen the story nor wholly delight. It makes you aware of your butt on the chair in the theater.Maybe worst of all is this movie's attempt to do with motion blur what Easy Rider did with lens flares. The difference is that 'avoid lens flares' was just a rule about 'professional' cinematography that was broken by a few rebels in the right movie for that. Motion blur is a fairly upsetting thing to look at, let alone on a big screen for shots that last two or three seconds, repeated seven or eight times in the movie. One of them is quite effective: up to some palm trees, 180 degree twist, and back down to the leads as they walk around a fountain. And there are some simple whip pans that are too fast to be upsetting. But this leaves multiple medium-speed motion blur pans, and the movie loses more than it could gain, multiple times, by breaking this rule. (If you feel that there is no 'rule' that says not to do long motion-blur shots when they don't add anything, I'll grant you your point, and counter by saying that the movie looks hideous and nauseating during those shots)",2,179,366,12 December 2016
Whiplash," Editing and Cinematography Excellence
","Very well shot, edited, acted and designed; with a fresh take on old ideas. The movie may have a very specific focus and be nothing earth-shattering on the intellectual side, but it's worth several Oscar nominations. The music is fantastic. See it on the big screen.As for the controversy around the abusive teacher, I would say that it's not necessary to feel that the teacher is justified or unjustified, good or evil, effective or hindering, in order to enjoy the movie and find interesting food for thought in it. If a semi-vicious teacher who, in the real world, would overstep the bounds of ethics and even effective technique, is a flaw in the movie, then it's not a damning one.",7,1,6,30 October 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Highly skilled, challenging, and full of brains and heart
","The film's technical merits are without exception. Most predominant is that the whole movie feels like one long sequence shot, from about minute 2 until nearly the end. There are disguised cuts, and the movie finds moments to settle down the camera to contrast the movement. But the orchestration of actors, the re-framing of the camera, and the support of crew outside the frame, are nothing short of phenomenal.The film's artistic merits are easy to see in the performances, design and composition, but harder to puzzle out emotionally/intellectually. They rely partly on multiple ambiguities, and the audience will need to do some broad-view thinking about life and art to really crack open the movie. For all of this, I would not say that the merits are so rarified that they should push away anyone who wants to see a challenging movie. They are hard to crack, but not because you really have to understand all the references.",9,18,41,6 November 2014
Mother!," A satiric allegory
","For those of you wondering about the sacrilegious content of this film, in my estimation, this film is ultimately critical of humanity as a whole (and therefore all religion), and not specifically critical of the Abrahamic religions, although it uses an often profane and shocking allegory about humanity's corrupt misinterpretation of the Old and New Testaments to get at its critiques of humanity.That said, not only am I going to write a 8/10 review of a movie that everyone seems to 10/10 LOVE or 1/10 HATE, but I'm also going to talk about this contriversial ironic allegory without using spoiler-examples to explain my points. I must love down-votes.mother! is, without doubt, the most aggressive movie that Aronofsky has written and directed. Though many of his movies have either profane content or intellectual challenges, this one is shocking for people of the Abrahamic religions en masse, and it has a layered intellectual challenge to it.The first challenge, for anyone seeing the movie without prior knowledge, is 'what the hell am I watching?'. Neither absurd/surreal movies, nor allegorical ones usually come with A-list stars and a name director, let alone anything this cruel and grotesque. And here I will spread the blame for people's mid-movie anger on two causes: 1) The film was sold as a horror movie in some quarters, which is the latest example of a battle that's been raging between filmmakers and suits for decades: don't misrepresent a movie in marketing for short-term opening weekend gain and long-term bad word of mouth. Nearly anyone who went to this movie in order to get a horror-genre fix left infuriated. 2) The fact that American audiences react with indignant cries of 'pretentious crap!' when they don't immediately understand a movie can be blamed on both individual closed-mindedness and insecurity, AND on Hollywood conditioning audiences to expect easily-understood wish-fulfillment. You don't have to search real far to find the user reviews reacting to all of this. (Tangentially, we need more articles saying 'Hey, *none* of us immediately understand challenging movies, and we're not supposed to understand them immediately, so would you please stop being mad and insecure about it?')That said, allegory itself has been derided for being a narrative form with a low ceiling: either the allegorical correspondences and analogies are off, or the didactic intent is for the unsubtle browbeating of the unsophisticated. I'm not sure that I can blame viewers for reacting to the allegory as a form, or this one as heavy-handed, though I think the movie rises above these problems. Here is where the second layer of intellectual challenge happens in mother!, and where it is most diabolical: 1) allegory dates as far back in the Abrahamic religions as you care to go, and allegorical interpretation (sometimes forced) has been practiced by scholars in those religions for centuries. Therefore allegory is a fitting form to use to criticize humanity's willful misinterpretations. 2) The movie's allegory is chock-full of challenging (or if you please, blasphemous) ironies that amount to something akin to a 21st century Gnosticism. 3) The allegory here is NOT in a point-for-point correspondence, but asks the audience to abstract a bit since there are several analogies running in parallel here, and they interact in a fairly unstable Moby Dick kind of way (sometimes the whale is just a whale). Combine these three things with the profane content of the film and you have a work that is profane in the way that all great satire must be, and in the way that may prevent it from being received more comprehendingly. However, I think it should be received in this way: the target of attack here is human interpretation; the attack is on what kinds of behavior humanity will excuse by willfully interpreting their own religion until they get what they want the answer to be. This mother ultimately objects and the audience like the humans in the movie say 'But mom.... dad said I could!'.As for the other filmmaking elements beside the narrative, they are flawless.I'm grading mother! at 8/10, with the main flaws being that the didactic side is (necessarily) heavy-handed, and that the movie probably wouldn't wouldn't sustain more than two viewings worth of interest.",8,1,10,26 September 2017
Inside Llewyn Davis," A 1960's folk musician, as told through Bronze Age literature
","For those of you who are considering seeing this movie, a few thoughts:From my point of view, the user-reviewers who didn't like it missed out on the subtleties and complexities of character and tone. A movie's not obliged to follow the same form as most, or tell a story we've heard before. There's odd, dry humor that percolates through it, as you might expect from the Coen brothers, but this is their more serious side. Unlike many of their other movies, this has a more sincere warmth to go with the darkness, the oddness, and the intelligence.It's a rich, sad, dark winter's tale. It's the kind of stiff drink of storytelling that would not be out of place in the Bible or Gilgamesh or other classic literature. It's about a man stuck in a time and place and manner of being, as he hits up against the limits of what is possible for him, and often is his own worst enemy. See this when you are in the mood for more nutritious entertainment, and feel free to give yourself just enough distance from the main character that you can have a good look at what makes him human. The music is great, and it's all live performances.",9,1,2,18 July 2016
