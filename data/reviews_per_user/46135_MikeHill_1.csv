Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie rocks!!!
","Let me just say, the critics obviously have a bug lodged somewhere when it comes to this franchise.  I found this movie fast paced, and visually stunning.  Honestly, did Lucas ever promise anything more than a wild ride? Did he say a lot about famous death scenes (Braveheart)or famous love scenes (Titanic)?  NO!  He promised us a special effect laden Star Wars Episode, and he delivered it.  I had a blast watching it, and will see it many more times.  If I remember, reviews of the first Star Wars was less than positive.  Look how that turned out.  Without a grand mythology for our technically and scientifically based society, it is a pleasure to be able to see out knights, and princesses.  Our dragons and Sorcery.  Now its just used in a futuristic fashion.  Plus Lucas even placed a conspiracy for X-File fans.  Go see the movie, ignore the critics.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
