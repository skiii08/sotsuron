Source Code," Unbelievably bad
","I can't believe just how bad the movie was. It's totally worthless at both its 'action' and at its 'meaning' level. It's not just that the plot's ideas are far-fetched. They're not even consistent or logical.E.g. how could it be possible to construct a whole parallel world from just memories of a handful of people? At some point we learn that 'some part' of the main character's brain is 'still functioning'. It would be absolutely impossible to undertake the complex cognitive tasks he does with just 'some part' of his brain. Etc, etc. As for the 'meaning', what was it supposed to be? That we should learn to care about every moment of our lives? That there exist worlds parallel to ours? That we should love our neighbors? Whatever it was, it's an utter clich√©. It's hard to believe someone in Hollywood accepted this script. Obviously they consider viewers idiots. I hope they are not right.",1,45,91,30 June 2011
