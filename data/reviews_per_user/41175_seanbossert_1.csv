Sucker Punch," Meh..
","Yea it was what the guy who has the front page reviewed it as. But still, it comes across to me as a movie from Hollywood that is trying all so desperately to not be from Hollywood. And not quite succeeding. Actually not even close to succeeding.It jumps from here to there without any real explanation, probably like LSD. At least in Alice in Wonderland, the viewer knew that it was a wile trip for a reason. The viewer in this case is supposed to just accept it because the hot girls are there.. whoopie di doo. Hellboy at least had a reason for existing...From start to finish it is just a deception of why you fell for typical Hollywood advertising and why they won't give you a refund for the lost time you spent watching the space that is Sucker Punch.",2,1,5,27 December 2011
