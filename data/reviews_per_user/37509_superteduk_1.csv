It," Boring, predictable dross
","I know this is a remake so we all know what happens but with a few variations, twists etc. This was sooo predictable that my mind was constantly wandering and lurching back to the original and wondering why the script was changed and changed by someone with the mental age of 7. This was chapter one then?, i will watch chapter in 4 or 5 years when its on film 4 for free. 
From the positive reviews it appears those are from either children (which is naughty), someone who has never read the book (sloppy), never seen the original (why?), or paid to submit reviews for poor films and yes they do exist.",1,0,1,12 December 2017
