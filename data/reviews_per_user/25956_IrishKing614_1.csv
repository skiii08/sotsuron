Sucker Punch," The only movie that compares with Avatar
","I just had the pleasure of watching Sucker Punch, and in imax, no less. What an experience that was. After the movie, I was talking my girlfriends ear off like a little kid about how awesome this movie was, and the only other movie that had me doing that was the great Avatar. This movie is absolutely breathtaking, to the surprisingly good acting involved, to the great script (i think), and of course, the amazing CGI. The scene with the dragons...wow. I wont spoil it, but if you haven't seen this, please, do your self a favor and go see this as soon as possible. And don't be a cheapskate, spend the extra 3 or 4 bucks to see this in imax. Trust me, it wont be a decision you'll regret. I think that afterthis movie, if Mr Zack Snyder isn't considered one of Hollywoods top tier directors, then there's something going on there, cause he obviously is a master at his craft. The guy is the next Tim Burton/Peter Jackson, in my opinion. Hes that good. Well done, Zack",8,4,10,27 March 2011
