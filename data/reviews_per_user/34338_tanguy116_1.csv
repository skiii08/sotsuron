The King's Speech," Great actors for a tepid film
","Great acting, boring film. As said elsewhere, this is way below The Queen. A regal version of a buddy movie.Firth does a great job but the director is obviously not willing to bet on it, since he turns the music on every time that Firth engages in long stammering periods. And, what is unforgivable, he adds music even to the King's Speech, the one the whole film has been leading to. We should be listening to it as the millions of listeners heard it that day: no music, radio cracking noises, ambient sound. But no, we get Firth + violins because the director does not seem to think that Firth alone can carry the scene.",4,15,35,23 January 2011
