The Blair Witch Project," I'm glad to finally have seen it!
","I first heard about this film a while back, and the first thing that came to mind was 'Shit, It'll never play here'.Fortunately, it began playing at the local theater yesterday, and I dragged 9 people along with me. This film is completely different from every other 'scary' movie I've seen. The documentary angle makes it very realistic, the fact that good doesn't always triumph makes it very scary, but the driving fear is that the audience never sees a thing, which leaves many unanswered questions.Definitely a chiller, but go in with an open mind, and don't go to the bathroom during the movie, a friend of mine did, and he missed the ending.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
