The Blair Witch Project," Overhyped, Nausea-Inducing Remake of The Last Broadcast
","Besides ripping the premise from movies like Man Bites Dog, The Last Broadcast, Cannibal Holocaust, and UPN's Incident in Lake County, this movie is an 84 minute commercial for Steadycam. It has been 3 hours since I watched this unscary and badly acted turkey and I am still nauseous from the constant jittery camerawork.  If you must see this thing, bring plenty of dramamine: it will reduce the nausea and if you're lucky, it will put you to sleep for the rest of the movie.  The only thing original about this godawful mess is the hype campaign which has convinced most of the movie reviewing community that nothing like this has even been made before.  The next thing I expect is to start hearing that this tripe was based on a true story.",1,1,3,25 July 1999
