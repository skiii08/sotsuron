The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mind blowing portrayal of the book!
",Having only got into the hunger games recently i very quickly caught up with the films and read the books prior to watching mocking jay part 1 as I wanted to be surprised I didn't read the whole of mocking jay until the day after watching the film once I had finished I knew immediately that the film perfectly portrayed everything the book had described and more.I literally sat on the edge of my seat from the minute it started. It took a while to come to terms with the fact there's no games in this film but there's no shortage of action even though it's not a massive amount it's enough to keep the film Interesting in between very important pieces of information. Once the film catches up to Peeta in the Capitol and the state that he's getting into at the hands of president snow your hooked on seeing what the games and the Capitol has done to all the victors mental state of mind and the damage that the games has done to them. Josh Hutchersons and Jennifer Lawrence's performances are truly astounding and heart braking to watch as they fall apart whilst still needing to be together and the fact that deep down katniss does love peeta becomes more apparent as the movie goes on to the point that they rescue peeta to keep katniss from losing it all together only to be met with the complete opposite of love. I've read other reviews that say this film is boring etc and this is not the case it's the perfect platform to launch mocking jay part 2 as the audience is now prepared for what's to come. If the next movie is as detailed as this were in for the best movie of 2015 !,10,33,81,24 November 2014
