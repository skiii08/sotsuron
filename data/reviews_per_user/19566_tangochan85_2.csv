The Avengers," This is what super hero movies need to be doing, they need to be thinking not just going with the tried and overdone.
","I've been watching super hero stuff since I was first introduced to television, and I have to say that this is the best super hero anything I've ever seen. First, the writing was very tight and suspension of disbelief was not a challenge. The acting, directing, and editing were also examples of the best in the genre. The movie knew its audience, what we've seen, what we've experienced and seemed to set out to make a super hero movie that was everything you could want from a super hero movie without being your stereotypical hero movie. The Avengers are not perfect and even straight edge Captain America has his own faults. They come together because they have to and they want to. Mark Ruffalo is the best Banner/Hulk anyone could ask for, so if he gets replaced in the next movie, the people behind the replacement would be crazy. He is what all the Hulk movies needed to make the character work both as a person and a monster. My biggest quibble with this movie is the same quibble that I had with Captain America (2011) and Thor (2011). These three movies seem like PG movies on hyped up violence, and part of me wonders if they couldn't have been excellent with a PG rating. Did we need the PG-13 violence? I think in Marvel's Avengers, the level of violence works despite the rest of the plot being rather PG. In Thor and Captain America, it cut into the atmospheres of both of those movies, but it seemed to work for this movie.",10,1,4,4 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Cartoonish in a good way. I had fun.
","If the Raimi trilogy was about Spider-Man in reality, then this is about turning the comic into reality. This is most evident during the battle between Spider-Man and Dr. Connor where the special effects look very much like moving comic panels. This movie also seemed to highlight what separates those from generation Y born in the 80's and those from generation Y born in the 90's. This is very much Spider-Man and Peter Parker is very much Peter Parker, however, there are marked differences between Maguire's Parker and Garfield's Parker that come down to the movies trying to relate to the teenagers comprising the audience in their respective runs. I think that if I was ten years younger, this movie would have spoken to me on the level that Raimi's movies spoke to me on, but I'm not a teenager anymore and so there was less to relate to this time. It still made for an enjoyable movie, however, and I am looking forward to its inevitable sequel.",6,3,7,6 July 2012
