The Ring," Hollywood destroys yet another great movie.
","First of all, this remake is nowhere near as good as the real, japanese, movie. The people who made it apparently never even realised why it was called 'Ring' (or 'Ringu'). It does not have anything to do with the apparent well that is in the movie, it has to do spreading a video tape around, which is almost completely left out of this horrible remake.People die of heart-attacks and look like zombies, and noone suspects that anything is wrong. I hope doctors in the US are not that stupid.If you want to see this movie; don't. See the japanese original instead. Then, when you've seen that, see Ringu 2, and after that Ringu 0. After that you can watch The Ring if you really feel that you have to, but it will only look like a worthless remake, almost as bad as the korean remake 'Ring Virus'.",2,0,0,2 January 2003
