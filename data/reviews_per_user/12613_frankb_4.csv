Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's good, but not great.
","SW1 has some incredibly awesome technology that viewers beg  to know how certain scenes were filmed, e.g., the 'hall' of the Interplanetary Congress with its floating platforms.  And brief glimpses of cities and landscapes exist which you wish you could still-frame in order to lavish your attention upon them.  Regardless, the sum total of the film falls far short of the wit, bravado and mystery of Episodes IV, V, and VI.  It took me awhile to 'get into' the movie because of the new characters, but also the Gunga (a donkey head on a human body) really irritated me.  What an embarrassingly stupid sidekick in comparison to Chewbacca!  Most bothersome of all however was the lack of mystery.  Before we wondered if Luke and Leia were brother and sister.  Was Vader their father? Or Hans, or who's? Was Obi-wan, Vader's brother?  Etc., etc.  There's none of these questions to care about in SW1 and the movie suffers terribly because of it.",7,0,0,23 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," terrific!
","I was sick going into SP and I'm glad I went because after laughing for over an hour and half, I felt ten times better.  The movie is far better than I expected though definitely not for kids under 16.  They simply would not comprehend it beyond face value.  Agreed, at face value it's still howlingly funny, but the sum total is far more than that.  The only thing that kind of turned me off was Saddam Hussein and Satan.  I'm no prude, but those bits seemed out of context with the rest the movie somehow.  Funny on their own but ...?",9,0,0,2 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," utterly fascinating
","EWS is extraordinarily fascinating and an intellectual extravaganza. Though perhaps not Kubrick's greatest film (I've always been partial to 2001 and Strangelove), it would be a lifetime achievement for most other directors. I can see where this film might not appeal to many people under 40 -- it is quite simply that 'adult' in the true meaning of the word.  The movie nearly begs for previous life experience to understand it on a psychological level. And it is SO Creepy.  That surprised me more than anything, though maybe it shouldn't have.  Kidman is a bit too cloying, but Cruise gives the performance of his life.",10,0,0,22 July 1999
The Matrix," absolutely stunning
","Went to THE MATRIX expecting the standard fare.  What a surprise I got! This was as good or better than DARK CITY.  The production is outstanding, the acting is unnervingly futuristic, the plot was highly thought-provoking, and for someone who isn't into kickboxer movies -- this movie kicked butt all over the place.  My eyes were glued to the screen, and I just crossed my legs tight when nature called -- because no way was I going to miss a second of this fantastic, thrilling film.",9,0,0,2 April 1999
