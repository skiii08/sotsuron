Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3, a perfect sequel to The Avengers (!) & Iron Man 2
","I watched Iron Man 3 with a low expectations due to the mostly negative reviews. After watching it, I have actually no clue why all those reviews are so extremely negative. Of course a third movie is not the same as the movies before, there have to be changes because without them everyone would complain about the movie being boring and the same. And of course the plot twist regarding the Mandarin are somewhat.. let's say unexpected. A lot of people also said that the movie was really unrealistic, I can imagine why they say that but after The Avengers I thought the reality had already gone. Iron Man 3 is indeed a sequel of Iron Man 2 but also (not to forget!!) of The Avengers. And please don't say flying aliens from another dimension are realistic..Therefore I'd like to talk about the positive parts in the movie (which are the most parts if you ask me) and by discussing those parts I'll keep in mind that Iron Man 3 follows Tony Stark after dealing with the events in The Avengers. The thing I really love is that we see Tony Stark as a person, not only as a character that controls the Iron Man suit. Tony dealt with a lot of problems in The Avengers, he even almost committed suicide to save the world, something that he wouldn't have done in Iron Man 1. This is a major example of the change of Tony Stark as a person. What would you guys think? That after almost killing himself he would just be the same old Tony Stark. That after seeing aliens and other things he (the technician who only believed in the laws of physics) thought weren't possible he would just be cocky, humorous and afraid of nothing. That (!) would be unrealistic. I think Iron Man 3 is the perfect sequel to Iron Man 2 and The Avengers just because it follows the growth of Tony Stark's character. The Manderin could have been a lot cooler, I'll agree with you on that point. But I do think this is a plot twist that no one saw coming, which is the definition of a good plot twist in my opinion.",8,19,30,20 August 2013
