The King's Speech," Excellent film with great characters (review contains spoilers)
","The King's Speech tells the story of Albert (or 'Bertie', as called by his family), a man who then becomes King George VI and the father of Queen Elizabeth II. As the second son of King George V (Michael Gambon) he is not expected to inherit the throne. After his father's death in 1936, his elder brother ascends the throne as Edward VIII (Guy Pearce). But mere a year later King Edward is forced to abdicate because of his unacceptable relationship with American divorcée Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). After Edward's abdication, Bertie has no other choice and he reluctantly assumes the throne and becomes King George VI. Although Bertie is a bright and temperamental man, he was widely considered ­ by all but his father ­ unfit to be king because of his stammering problem.The film centers on Bertie's (Colin Firth) lifelong struggle to overcome his speech impediment. Bertie has suffered from a stammer from the age of 4 or 5. Bertie's wife Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) wants to help her husband in his increasing need to speak at public functions and she finds an unconventional speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Bertie has tried several different therapies over the years but it wasn't until he started working with Lionel and his out of ordinary techniques that he really began to make progress. They form an unexpected friendship and with a lot of hard work Bertie is finally able to find his voice and he delivers an inspiring radio speech heard around the world, which unites the kingdom and leads it boldly to the Second World WarThe script of the film, written by David Seidler, is just brilliant. The story, which is based on true historical events, is very well paced and advances smoothly. The story is laid out cleverly and it takes the viewer into the 20th century England with the characters of the film. Tom Hooper's directing is also great. The film's development towards the finale is excellently handled and executed. It keeps the audience held in the story until the climactic ending, leaving them holding their breath. David Seidler won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. And Tom Hooper won the Oscar for Best Achievement in Directing.Colin Firth's (Bertie) acting is outstanding. He performs the role with deep emotion and dedication. He makes the character believable and the viewer can really relate to the character and his feelings. Geoffrey Rush plays Lionel Logue, the Australian speech therapist. He certainly is at his best in this role. As a supportive actor Geoffrey Rush leaves enough room for Colin Firth to expand Bertie's personality without interference, yet he is not overshadowed by Colin Firth and he really shines through with his excellent performance. He also brings emotions and certain calmness to the character which makes Lionel Logue a very strong character alongside Bertie. The relationship between Bertie and Lionel Logue is the heart of the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is astonishing and they both really exceed themselves in The King's Speech. Geoffrey Rush was nominated for an Oscar (Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role) for his role as Lionel Logue. Colin Firth won the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.I was very impressed after seeing the film. It had very deep emotion in it and the story and the characters made the film unforgettable. The King's Speech was one of the best films I've seen. The language was easy to understand because the characters spoke very clearly. I would recommend this film to everyone, because it's not only a story about a man who becomes a king. But also a story of life, of great courage and above all, realizing that everyone has a voice ­ It just has to be found.",10,1,1,1 March 2016
