The Blair Witch Project," Makes Halloween look like It's A Wonderful Life.
",I can't believe what I saw. Neither will you. This movie defines creepy. The pile of rocks. The children crying. The house. This is actually making me cry. I'll admit it. This is the scariest thing ever put on film. I'm never going in some place with bushes around me. I will never forget this movie. It stays with you for a few days. Your scared to even go somewhere in your house at night. This IS snuff. All the acting. The settings. Everything is so real. I guess that's why it's scarey. Halloween used to be my favorite horror movie. Not anymore. I just can't believe it. It's so real. I think it should at least nominated for best picture. If you don't think so than see it. Everyone who saw this had to have been very scared. Those who weren't are liars. There's nothing in the world that will make you this scared. The plot is simple. Three teens go into the woods to make a movie. Never seen again. We see what happens to them. If you don't like to be scared than don't see it. But it's the best horror movie ever made. The Blair Witch Project: A+,10,1,2,4 September 1999
Alien 3," Well, I liked it.
","This movie wasn't that bad. I don't see why people find it to be a stupid movie. It was better than the first. It is a little boring but it picks up speed like the first Alien. It has so cool f/x and the look of the movie is very cool. The acting is ok. There are a lot of people in this movie that I've not seen before. It has a lot of British talking and the movie got a well-deserved R rating. The blood and language just keep coming but I didn't mind. The sets were great. The location was a good spot. The plot is good. It deals with Ripley fighting off another Alien that has been grown inside a dog. It's a fight to the finish. Ripley learns something about herself but I won't say even though everyone already knows what happens to her. The script was ok but not as good as Aliens. It's a good movie that you should check out sometime. I still think it's better than Alien, but not by much. Alien3: B",8,0,4,17 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'm very, very disapointed, but not at the movie.
","This is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time. The script was great and the direction was first rate. The light saber duel was a masterpiece all alone. The best part of the movie though is the pod race. I was hanging on to my seat tight. I loved it. The performances were all really good. I doen't really know why people hate Jar Jar. What's wrong with him. He's not funny but nothing's wrong with him. This isn't a comedy, people. I loved Darth Maul. He looked the best. He's scarier than Darth Vader. I hope this comes out on DVD. It will be the best movie experience ever. Go watch this movie and forget what everyone says. Judge for yourself. Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace: A+",10,0,0,13 June 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Good drama, but not the usual Sci-Fi summer blockbuster.
","I have to admit that this movie left me wanting more action. But maybe I was expecting to much. From a Sci-Fi summer movie, I'd expect more action. But maybe Spielberg was trying to make that type of movie. I guess he wanted to try something new. For the most part he succeded. What I saw was good. Differant, but good. It has pretty cool effects and really good acting and plot for the type of movie it is. Some parts are a lttle hard to follow but the kids wouldn't mind at all. It's made for them anyway. So don't expect blood and guts like Alien, or even another great winner from Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan. Check it out. It's worth buying and your kids won't get tired of it for a LONG time. Being a Spielberg fan, this was one of his best. Just don't go expecting Jurassic Park.",9,1,2,16 March 1999
Alien: Resurrection," The second best in the series.
",This movie was really cool. I saw it at the theaters when it came out on Thanksgiving. I didn't really like it that much. I thought it was ok but not as good as Alien3. I rented it when it came out on video. I was blown away. I really liked it and I didn't know why I didn't like it at the theater. The f/x were really good. The ships and explosions looked cool. The plot was good. It had to deal with Ripley being cloned to get the alien out of her that was in her in the third movie. The action sequences were really good. The part where they are in the water trying to swim to a room had me on the edge all the way through. The aliens looked really cool this time. The newborn looked really scary. It was a great movie and Sigourney Weaver did a great job. Almost better than Aliens. A great movie none the less. Alien: Resurrection: B+,9,11,20,9 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Very funny but not for a lot of people.
","This movie was so much better than the TV show. The jokes had me laughing so much it was hard to tell what all was happening. The animation sucks, of course. It's still a really good movie if you find jokes that make fun of a lot of people funny. It has the same bad language but this is taken over the line since they can cuss a lot more in a movie than on TV. It was really good if you compare it to the show. I haven't laughed at something so offensive since There's Something About Mary. It's not for kids. The age you should be to see this movie is about 16. It's way too raunchy but strangely funny. Go see it with a friend. Just don't go with your parents! That would be a bad move. As Cartman would say '#!#$!' South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut: A-",9,0,0,6 July 1999
Batman Returns," A little boring but not a bad movie.
",This is my least favorite Batman movie. It's not that bad though. It's just a little slow and too dark for the kids to enjoy. It has good f/x and great make-up but the plot is a little dumb. The villains are not that great and that's what the Batman movies are about. The plot has Bruce still fighting the scum of Gotham but now he has two baddies to take care of. The  Penguin and Catwoman. Both trying to destroy Bruce and each other. Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job as Catwoman and Danny DeVito was also good but the characters were a little dumb. Like Christopher Walken's character. It's not as good as Batman or Batman Forever but it really beats Batman and Robin. Check it out if you like any of the actors or if you just like Batman. You'll be sure to find something you like about it but it didn't do for me what the first did. Batman Returns: C+,7,0,0,9 October 1999
The Mummy," Can't wait for the DVD.
","I thought this movie had a great sense of humor and some cool action sequences. The story is definetly not all together but so what. These are the kind of movies I die for. I love a great blockbuster. This one really qualified. Some people will find it childish, some fun. Either way, you should accept this as it is. A blockbuster. The f/x were great. The acting was ok. The story didn't really stay together. I loved it anyway. The thing that surprises me is that it's actually funny. Most event movies try but fail and end up being worse. This movie had the perfect mix of laughs. Check it out. You might like it or you might not. The look of it will have you in loving most of the movie. It's just a fun ride. The Mummy: B+",8,0,0,15 June 1999
Home Alone," A great family movie.
","I loved this movie. It's a really funny movie that your family will like. The plot has to deal with a little kid who is mad at his family. He wishes they would just go away. Than one day when he's supposed to go to France, the family is rushing and they forget to take him. So he now has the house to himself, thinking he made them disappear. Macaulay Culkin was just great as Kevin McCallister, the kid who just wants to be alone but soon regrets it. This is like a childhood dream. I remember when I was mad at my family. Along with that, he has to deal with two robbers. He does the coolest thing, he sets traps through his house. Using all types of things like a blow torch and feathers. It's as funny as it sounds. Check it out if you haven't. Get it on Christmas and watch it with your family. You'll all love it. Home Alone: A",10,0,2,9 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Quite good. Too bad the storyline wasn't as interesting as the first two.
","I think this movie lacked, compared to Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. The main reason: the Ewoks. Sorry, but I really don't care for furry little rates in a Star Wars series, with the exception of Chewbacca. They just made the movie short on action. We had to watch them worship C-3PO and watch them throw rocks at storm troopers. The rest of the movie was cool. The chase on the speeders in the forest. The sand-pit with Jabba. The final battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The destruction of the new Death Star. Those parts were cool. Forget everything else. Buy the Special Edition and look at the added stuff. It's worth it. Not bad for a third movie in a trilogy. Most of them suck. Return of the Jedi: B+",9,2,4,4 April 1999
Alien," The worst in the series but still an ok movie.
","This was a good movie. The only thing wrong with it is nothing happens. It takes too long to get where it's trying to go but when it gets there, it's a fun ride. It's a well made movie. The f/x a good for it's time. The make-up f/x were really cool looking. The actors did their parts very well. The script was very good too. The only problem is the plot. It needed a lot more action. I really liked the movies that followed. Aliens IS the best sci/fi around. Alien3 was a good movie that no one really liked. Alien: Resurrection was a really good movie. I loved that one. The whole series is great but this isn't the best. I think the reason it's so highly rated is because it really stands above the normal slimey-alien-from-outer-space movies. For that, I give it credit. For the plot, well, that's another story. Alien B-",7,5,11,17 July 1999
Forrest Gump," A movie so great, it hardly seems like 2 hours and 24 minutes.
","This movie was well acted and a little sad toward the end. It seemed like a movie either liked or disliked by people. I for one liked it. It's neat how they edit Tom Hanks in almost every major event from the 50's to the 80's. It's not really a movie about special effects but it manages to squeeze some in. I think what caught most people's eyes was that we understood Hanks. We could relate to his grief and rise to intelligence. For me, this will remain one of the greatest movies of all time. For others, sorry but you'll have to wait for another movie that touches your heart with gentle hands.",9,0,2,16 March 1999
Armageddon," What's the big deal?
",This movie not only had extremely tight action but had a better cast and better acting than Deep Impact. It's probably better to watch it on DVD but it's still great on vhs. The effects are very very very good. Almost as good as Independence Day. I cared about the characters. I don't know why others didn't. Be honest. Did you really want it to end the way it did. Mike Bay hasn't lost one step and I'm glad he attempted an event movie.  It had just the right amount of humor and is jam packed with action. Watch it again if you thought it was bad. Maybe you fell alseep. I know I will watch it countless times on DVD. It was probably the best of all the huge box office blow outs in the incredible summer of '98.,10,1,1,31 January 1999
American Beauty," Thought-provoking movie about our lives with great performances.
","I just saw this movie with my mom and sister. I know it had a lot of things in it that would probably make you feel stupid when watching it with your mom but I didn't feel that embarassed. I wanted to watch a movie about real life with my mom so we could have something more interesting to talk about and I thought this would do it. It did. This movie tells the very truth that, I think, most people block out of there minds. Life is full of problems and we all have them. Even if they are differant than other people's problems, they still affect us all in the same way. I would give the movie an A just for that message. Also, most people on this Earth are too preoccupied with their life because they think they have it so bad, that they never stop to look at what they've got. If they were to look and see the many beautiful things in life just once, they'd see that their life is great for that reason alone. Well about the movie, it's great. I think it's the best movie this year so far. The performances are undescribable. Everyone does outstanding jobs, but the best by far is, of course, Kevin Spacey as the ever so true Lester Burnham. He does so good at bring the character to life that it's the best performance I've seen in my whole life and the best in movie history. He is your average person who starts to get fed up with his whole life and lives like he should've lived his entire life: doing anything he feels like doing. Even if that means masturbating right in front of his wife. His life being changed sets off the whole mess that messes his family up more than it already was, which was to say, a lot. He smokes weed, works out, listens to his music he used to when he was a wild teen, even falls in love with his sisters friend. More and more he changes, so does his family. Well, you can figure the rest out for yourself, can't you? Go see it. You'll look at life in a whole new way. You'll realize that your not the only one with problems. Even the people who live in a nice house with nice jobs have it bad. I just hope we can all learn that someday. We might not now, but trust me, you will. American Beauty: A+",10,0,0,7 November 1999
Aliens," One of the best sci/fi movies ever made.
","This is a huge improvement over Alien. Sigourney Weaver is doing the best performance of her career. The Oscar belonged to her. This has got some great f/x. The plot is first-rate. The action sequences are to die for. The acting is great. Everything about this movie is so great! This is a fun, scary, great movie. It's one of the best movies ever made. It's so well made that even if it had bad acting or a poor script, it would be hard to notice but it doesn't have those flaws. The plot has to deal with Ellen Ripley going back on the planet that she picked up the Alien in the first movie. She goes with a team of Marines that have some cool guns. The best character isn't Ripley this time. It's Private Hudson. He's so funny and he's the person you could relate to. Bill Paxton does a great job as the funny guy. He acts scared in the beginning but really gets going. This is a great movie. James Cameron is one of the best directors ever. Aliens: A+",10,1,2,17 July 1999
Die Hard 2," Not as good as the first but a really great sequel.
","This was a great action movie. It wasn't as good as the first but it was a terrific thriller. It has Bruce Willis doing another great performance as the cop who keeps having a very bad day. It has some good supporting characters and a really smart script. The plot has Bruce Willis at an airport waiting for his wife. Than, what do you know, it gets taken over by some very bad people. They want to get a drug dealer that is coming to America to be put on trial. One of the better action sequences is when Bruce is out on the runway and has to get out of a plane that's ready to explode. It's just another day for John McClane but it's one big roller-coaster ride for us. Die Hard 2: Die Harder: B+",9,0,1,7 July 1999
Independence Day," For everyone who saw this and thinks they wasted seven bucks, HA! HA! HA!
","What, does it hurt if your brain isn't thinking? You poor babies! This is one of the best movies ever made. Who can resist seeing cranky New Yorkers getting zapped. It's not like this movie looks like This Island Earth or something. It has THE best f/x. I know I say that about a lot of movies but this one gets the award. It's just a roller-coster ride with action, effects, spaceships, aliens and strippers. What more do you need? I think you need your head examined. This movie has an A-list cast and some good comedy by Will Smith and Randy Quaid. The script was cool. The climax was also something to love. This movie should have been number 4 on the AFI list of the 100 greatest movies. I'm so greatful this movie was made. If it wasn't, I wouldn't even be watching sci/fi movies. Without a doubt, THE BEST SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER EXTRAVAGANZA IN THE WORLD!!! Independence Day: A+",10,0,1,4 April 1999
Ghostbusters," The best movie from the '80's!
","This movie blew me away as a child. I loved everything about it. The f/x still look great today. The best effect in motion picture history: the road opening and our heroes falling in. Pure genius! I must have seen this movie more than a million times to date. It is one of the funniest movies out there. If you haven't seen this, but everyone has, go see it right now. What are you waiting for? I didn't really understand the humor as a kid but I look back at it and laugh for minutes. I think this was overlooked at the Academy Awards. Why wouldn't they at least nominate it for best picture? I don't think you will ever be able to see another comedy as well written and acted as this. I will always look back at this movie with childhood memories. Always.",10,0,0,2 April 1999
Men in Black," A really good movie along the lines of Ghostbusters.
","I saw this when it came out during the summer of '97. It was cool. I really liked this movie just for the fact that it tries to be a lot like Ghostbusters. I loved Ghostbusters and this was almost a total rip-off but it's so fun to watch. A lot of people saw it and most liked. I loved it. The only drawback is that it's too much like Ghostbusters but that isn't really a drawback because Ghostbusters was really good. The big guns, slime, end-of-the-world plot, a very funny, and even witty, comedy. The plot is simple. Will Smith signs up for a secret government agency. They go around and blow up aliens. Then they find out that the world will end and they try to stop it. The f/x were very cool. I loved the spaceship crashing into the ground. The acting was very good too. Will Smith was very funny and Tommy Lee Jones was great as usual. This is a very cool movie and you should see it if you haven't. Your sure to like. Men in Black: B+",9,0,0,10 October 1999

Titanic," Even though I'm a guy, I still love this movie.
","I was going to see a movie one snowy night in December. My friend suggested Tomorrow Never Dies but I was wanting to see Titanic sence last summer. I was expecting a disaster movie but I got a lot more. This movie takes you to the ship in 1912. You're there. You see it. You feel it. It's actually like you'r ea part of the movie. This movie wasn't really all that great in script writing, but how many are? Most guys say this movie sucked and had no point. I think they just weren't man enough to admit it. If you feel like reliving history, than you should see this. The end is so creepy because you feel like you're there. You can't help wonder what it was like for those unlucky passengers. The effects of the ship sinking was VERY realistic and this movie was definitely worth the 200 million it took to make it. I admit the end is sad but that makes it all the more realistic. It's one of the greatest movies of all time and the most successful of all time and one of my favorites of all time.Relive the past and see this movie.",10,1,2,5 March 1999
Die Hard," Great action movie. One of the best.
","This is a great movie. I've heard some people say it's good but unrealistic. How?? It could happen. Anyway, it's a great action movie with some parts that make you grab the arm of the person next to you. It's about a cop who is meeting his wife in L.A. and terrorists take over the building. Bruce Willis should have at least been nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. He is so human in this movie. He acts like a real person would in the same situation. He doesn't want to go after the bad guys but he loves his wife and will fight for her and his life just the same. The action is big, the acting great, the effects good, and the movie is one of the best action movies ever made. The reason it doesn't get a lot more credit than it should is because their are so many that copy the idea. It's a countless list of movies that used it's plot. See this right now if you haven't. You'll love it. Die Hard: A+",10,0,1,7 July 1999
Scream 2," Great movie. How many horror movies can say that about their sequels?
","This was a cool follow-up to the scary Scream. It tells about the survivers from the first movie. It has Sidney being stalked again by a different psycho while she's at college. It has great action sequences and some really good scares but, of course, it's not as good as the first. The end of the first was better than this but the end will have you on the edge of your seat also. It's really hard to guess who is stalking  Sidney because you really wouldn't know even if you went down the whole list of the cast. It's someone that isn't even the person you wouldn't think. It has a really good plot and great acting and it's really good because most horror sequels suck so much. It's fun and at the same time frightful. Scream 2: B+",8,0,0,7 July 1999
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A great third.
","This is yet another great installment in the great Die Hard movies. It has Bruce Willis running around New York with a partner who has a problem with white people trying to get him killed. There is great action sequences including a bomb in a train. It's another roller-coaster ride for Bruce's character John McClane and us as well. The plot is a little dumb at times but from a third action movie that's good anyway, you really don't notice. The acting was also good. Jeremy Irons is a really good bad guy but not as good as Alan Rickman. Most of the time, Bruce and Sam just cuss at each other but it was nice to see Bruce paired up with someone with even more attitude than him. It's a really good movie but the violence and language are not really for kids. Die Hard: With a Vengeance: B",10,0,0,7 July 1999
The Lion King," Great movie. Sort of.
","Ok, I need to get something off my chest. This was a really good movie. However, it isn't THE best Disney movie. That award goes to Toy Story. All in all, it's worth buying but if you want the best movie out there, you might want to buy another movie. The animation is really great though. Watch the willdebeest running while Simba runs as fast as he can. If you have surround sound, it will sound like you have animals running through your living room. I guess what I find to be weak parts to this movie is the fact that it couldn't have a better script than Toy Story or Hercules. Where's the comedy??? All the voices are done pretty good and Jeremy Irons was really good as the menacing villian. It's good if you have nothing better to do on a sunny or rainy afternoon.",10,0,2,28 March 1999
Scream," If this isn't one of the best slasher movies, I don't know what is.
","Only one movie actually comes close to beating this as the best slasher movie. That would be Halloween, which Scream gets all its inspiration from. This movie features top-notch scares and great suspense that reaches the roof. You'll love this if you like slasher movies. You love it if you like comedies. This is the kind of movie that has something for everyone. I only regret seeing it some many times before I knew how to enjoy slashers. The jump-feeling you experence in these type of movies is addictive to me. I just want to be so surprised that I almost have a heart attack or something. I already know when a scary part is coming so it doesn't really work. I just wish I could erase it from my memory. Watch it again and pee my pants. If you haven't seen this yet, I suggest you watch it alone at night with the lights dimmed and turn you surround sound up. I envy you so much.",10,0,0,28 March 1999
Halloween," The best and most original slasher!!!
","I remember this one time I was in Michigan for the summer. My parents gave me 40 bucks to buy food and stuff I needed. Well you know what happened with that money. I was staying at my grandma's house. There is a mall close and being the movie buff that I am, I bought a movie. I thought about what to get. I was going to get Halloween or Speed 2. I thought of Halloween because I was looking for something to really make me jump. I remember seeing it for my 11th birthday. I didn't understand why it was scary. I didn't know how to be scared. I thought it was about paranoia. I was wrong. It's all about the jump you get when something jumps out of somewhere that you wouldn't expect. So I bought this movie. Thank God I didn't get Speed 2. This movie scares you so much. I watched it right when I got home. It was the REAL first time. If I was a 70 year old, I think I might have had a heart-attack. That's how much this scares you. The performances were pretty good. That was another shock I didn't expect. This is like Oscar winning performances when compared to other horror movies like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. I also like the suburb-type feeling it has. It's like it could happen to you. Friday the 13th is just a dumb camp movie, and I don't mean the summer camp. This was like a blue-print for Scream. They are both very similar. Well, this movie will scare you so much and it plays off reality. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a lie. That can't happen. Give me something that can happen so it feels scarier. So much suspense. So much screams. So much reality. I love this kind of thing. Why can't horror movies be as good as this???? The world may never know.",10,0,1,20 April 1999
Speed," The best action movie ever made.
","This was the movie that got me into action movies. I loved this so much when I first saw it. I thought about it every day. It was the kind of movie that just gets made once. When we rented this, I had to choose between Speed or that Pauly Shore movie In the Army Now. I'm really glad I chose Speed. It has one of the best plots ever. A bus that will blow up if it goes slower than 50 m.p.h.?!?! Timeless!!! It doesn't even stop there. It ends up going all the way to the subway in a great climactic showdown between Keanu Reeves and the great Dennis Hopper in his best role. He does the psycho role so good that it's creepy. I wouldn't even like action movies if this wasn't made. The only thing wrong is the mess ups. There's a lot. Sandra Bullock was another great thing. In some action movies, they try to show off a sexy lead by a sex scene like in True Lies or The Specialist. That draws your mind away from the action. I don't like that. I leave my sex scenes to porn. She was also very good in the role. This is the best action movie ever made. Everyone will love it. Speed: A+",10,0,0,7 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," A good movie that you think about well after it's over but a little too overrated.
","This movie was ok. I really think it wasn't as good as people said but it's still a cool movie. It's more of a psychological horror movie. It will scare you but it doesn't have a lot of action. I also noticed that many scenes in the trailer are not in the finished movie. All the scenes deleted looked a little actionful. Why did they leave them out? Anyway, the plot was really cool and the script was good. The acting was great. Bruce Willis was great as usual. Haley Joel Osment was a surprise. He didn't look like a good actor but he was pretty good. The plot has to deal with a child who can see dead people but they don't realize that they are dead. I did like it and will buy it on DVD but I don't understand why people think it's the best movie of the year. It was cool but not that cool. Now for the surprise ending. I already knew it because I was stupid and asked a friend what happens. If you don't know than it will be a bit of a surprise. I actually thought it was sad. It's like a little of The Exorcist and Ghost but must people will like it. I did but I didn't think it was better than Bruce's best movie, Armageddon. The Sixth Sense: B",10,0,0,3 October 1999
The Matrix," Terrific movie. Roller-coaster blockbuster that looks great, and I didn't even see the whole movie.
","I saw this movie last night. I was going to see two movies. The Mummy and The Matrix. I saw The Mummy first. It was good but didn't please me as much as The Matrix did. I got out of The Mummy later than I thought I would and missed about 25 minutes of The Matrix. I don't think it mattered. I loved all I saw. It was such a wild and loud ride, at one point, I thought I WAS living the movie. The effects were very good. The best I've seen. The plot was a little confusing but still it's just the best ride to take. The parts that really look cool are the training parts. The martial-arts moves were astonishing. I want to go see it again but not because I missed the beginning. I loved the parts movie that I saw so much. If you want to just be lost for 2 hours 15 minutes than take this ride. If you don't then take this ride. This is a movie that everyone will love. What about Keanu Reeves? He CAN act. I thought he did a really great job in this movie. I don't know if Star Wars-Episode One: The Phantom Menace can be as good as this movie. We'll have to wait and find out.",10,0,0,9 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The first of the mega-summer blockbuster blow-outs and one of the best.
","Everything about this movie is great. The effects just blow you away. This has a terrific script and HAS a plot. A really good one too. The action sequences are really clever and really action packed. The acting isn't really top notch, but what sci-fi is? It's probably the most liked movie in the history of movies. The new Special Editions are a great added feature. The end is the best in movie climaxes and ther's a lot to like about this blockbuster. I personaly like blockbusters. So this was definitely a great one for me. You won't be disapointed. Go see it right now, if you haven't but almost everyone has. The other thing that makes this movie stand out is its great sequels. Never have sequels looked so good compared to the original. This movie's got to be the best, but you already knew that, right?",Null,0,0,5 March 1999
Apollo 13," Face it, you know this was 1995's best movie.
","There were a lot of cool movie over the mega-box office summer of 1995. I think this is the best. I refer to it as something most people wouldn't call it. Thriller. It's like a pure thriller with very dramatic performances in it. So what if you know what happens in the end. It's the suspense that keeps this moving at the speed of a spaceship. The script is something else. So lines were kind of corny and didn't really need to be told. Like when Barbra Lovell wants to be a hippy for Halloween. Other than the script, this a thriller that keeps you interested because you can relate to the characters. It should have won more Academy Awards that it got. It also should have had more nominations.",10,0,1,28 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," What is it about this movie that makes it almost better than the almighty Star Wars?
","I remember the first time I saw this. I saw the end. I thought it was so pointless. I watched it again. The whole movie blows you away. It's not often that a sequel lives up to a really great movie like Star Wars. Aliens is an example. This movie had great f/x and one really great script. Never see that in a sci/fi movie to often do you? The only boring parts are on the Hoth planet. And I love that part! The action scenes are put together very well. This is one of my favorite movie sequels. If you love Star Wars or sci/fi's or movies period, you should have this in your movie collection very soon. It's just one huge thrill ride. Take the ride too. The Empire Strikes Back: A",10,0,0,30 May 1999
The Breakfast Club," One of my favorite movies
","This movie is just pure greatness. I love it some much. It's got to be the best of the '80s. It's got a lot of humor and it was actully sad when they are all talking about their problems. The talent is really great because you really wouldn't expect it from such young people. I think the reason people like it so much is because it tells about almost every type of person. Everyone knows a John Bender or Andrew Clark. The people who are just always getting in trouble and the ones who are just obsessed with a sport. I really like it because I have experienced what each person went through. I've been a brain, an athlete, a basketcase, a princess, and a criminal. And some people just don't understand other people's problems. Just because you're used to getting bad grades doesn't mean others are. It can be really painful for them. This movie also tells about good friends. You can find them in the strangest places. Someone you think you absolutely hate, you actully find things in you both that make you just the same. This movie really changed me. And i'm really thankful for that. When you get done watching this you will always feel glad that you have the friends you have but you won't be embarrassed to show people that they are your friends even if they aren't very liked by other people. Watch this movie and you'll agree.",10,0,1,31 January 1999
Jurassic Park," Great movie. Boring start.
","This movie was really great. Don't get me wrong. I loved it. But I really think the first half of this could have been A LOT better. The action doesn't even start until an hour of viewing. But what follows is absolutely terrific. It scares you at times when dinos pop out of nowhere and it is one f/x movie that people really liked. Most movies of this kind (Independence Day, Godzilla, Armageddon, ect. Which I liked ALL of) are movies that don't really please like this movie. It's got really smart action sequences and fairly good acting but I think they should have used more popular stars, but you mostly concentrate on the dinosouars, which do good acting jobs. I thought they would have been nominated for Best Actresses. The f/x are another thing. They look really good! Only if the first half was more exciting but oh well. The rest of the movie makes up for that mistake. That leaves one more thing. The sequel. I thought the sequel was top notch. It was even better than this movie. In my opinion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just slightly better than the first because it starts out with more action. That's unlikly for sequels. Watch them both. They will be remembered for generations. Until they become extinct. Or when the next blockbuster hits with great f/x and good script. Crowd-pleasers are so hard to find these days, aren't they?",9,1,2,13 February 1999
