"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," It's a lot of fun
","Professional female impersonators, Tick Belrose (Hugo Weaving), Bernadette (Terence Stamp) and Felicia (Guy Pierce) are booked to play at a new resort in the Outback of Australia, to which they travel in a pink bus christened 'Pricilla, Queen of the Desert'This is a new twist on the well worn buddy movie genre.  The actors do a great job and the story well paced.  While it does have it's dramtic moments Priscilla is basically a fun film which touches on the topics of tolerance and self expression without being preachy.",10,1,2,14 May 2003
