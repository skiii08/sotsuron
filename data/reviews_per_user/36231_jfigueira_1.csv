50 First Dates," Check it out 'chick-flick' & Sandler fans!
","I remember seeing the trailers for this movie when it was first released and thinking, 'I'll wait until rental...no cable.', but I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I watched at the end of a long New Years Day, which could explain my sentimentality, but I liked it! Although I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, I tend to enjoy his work, though sometimes, when it's not straight slapstick, it tends to be over-sentimental and maudlin.50 First Dates does have its sappy moments, but with romantic comedies, that's what you've signed up for.In an effort to appease hardcore Sandler devotees, they throw in your zany, sidekick, Rob Schnieder, doing a nearly-insulting stereotype caricature of an Islander...but that's just a smoke screen for some touching moments delivered by Sandler, Barrymore and Blake Clark, as Barrymore's father. Sean Astin plays an additional comedy relief role as Barrymore's steroidal brother, with a couple of decent moments delivered.But the best moments are really the way you feel when Sandler & Barrymore are doing their thing, drama-wise, I mean! Couples beware. Movies like this can put undue pressure on each partner to be as wonderful as Hollywood makes these two seem....'BELCH!, pass the popcorn, Madge!'",7,0,0,2 January 2005
