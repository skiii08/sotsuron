The Benchwarmers," Rob Schneider still rules!
","I don't think anyone expects these kind of movies to be Oscar worthy by any means, but I was pleasantly surprised how this story was handled. I was expecting something like The Animal, or Deuce Bigalow 2,or even the terrible White Chicks, but instead I was treated to something more than mindless humor. I really enjoyed the trio of Schneider, Spade, and Heder. I thought they worked really well off each other as geeky underdogs with Schneider as the unofficial leader of the group. I also enjoyed the performance by Jon Lovitz, as the uber-rich mega nerd with an unholy obsession of all things Star Wars related (my kind of guy) as well as cameos of the Kit 2000 and the original 66' Bat Mobile created by George Barris. This is one of the better ensembles of the late 80's to early 90's SNL alumnus, rounded out with Tim Meadows, and Chris Farley's younger brother John, as the ambiguous 'pool boy'. Benchwarmers is much more than cheesy humor, it has heart and keeps true to its title with its shear hilarity and heart-warming performances.",7,0,0,3 June 2006
