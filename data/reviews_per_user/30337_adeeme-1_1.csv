Alien 3," Aliens 3 what a disappointment
","What a disappointment. Aliens 3 is a continuation of the original Aliens and Aliens 2.At the beginning of Aliens 3, it appears the story will easily continue from the prior Alien film. Ripley portrayed the character Ripley in a move timide fashion then the prior versions of the film. Sigourney Weaver perform her roll of Ripley like Alien and Alien 2 never existed. How can Ripley be so brave in the prior Alien films and present herself so clueless in Alien 3. I enjoyed the story however if anyone associated with the film reads this, remember Ripley survived because she fights the Alien then escapes. Why would the director in Aliens 3 make Ripley something other than a strong females soldier with first hand knowledge on how to kill the Alien.",3,1,4,7 August 2012
