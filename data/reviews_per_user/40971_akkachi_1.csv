Hereditary," For those who like Horror movies with an actual storyline!
","This one really had it all, but as an avid horror movie watcher, I wouldn't recommend going into this one thinking you're about to see another Saw flick, etc. The acting? Superb. The plot? Fantastic, Hereditary leaves you with lots to talk about after the film. As far as the 'horror' part of things, I would say there are many scenes where horrific things happen which affect you and leave you shocked, and pull you into the movie and characters even more, but aren't necessarily 'scary'. I recommend this film to all. Horror fanatics, and even the average movie goer that thinks they don't like horror films. This is one that might just change your mind",8,18,36,13 June 2018
