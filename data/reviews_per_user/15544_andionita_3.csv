The Blair Witch Project," An Educational experience
","I got to see this film after my brother's room mate and his girlfriend remembered the occasion of seeing it at a Home cinema in a cabin. I had heard very much about the title. Even at a Media class at my university the professor mentioned 'Blair Witch project' for the hand-held camera view. Also one of my friends came into making some short movies about campus and stuff, and he was really into it, so one day he said: ''Rei, let's make a movie, I mean a real feel movie, OK - not quite as Blair Witch project- but still...After all this I just couldn't stand missing out on a influential piece of culture. The film itself is just one hour and a quarter long, but I guarantee you would want it to end way before and have impulses to check your watch.The footage found from three (probably cinema) students that wanted to make a documentary over the legend of the Blair Witch, and for the purpose they went into the woods of Maryland to find evidence.I really liked this movie! As a horror film it is a favorite. All classic horror movies are just 'directed', they build the tension through some events the director chooses and the actors behave as if wanting to get your chills going. Well, in Blair Witch all that happens is perfectly - and I mean it - normal.Just remembering the decline the group suffers, that you might think the guys will resort to inhuman acts to survive (probably in a Hollywood movie this would have been sought - but here the mere idea of it is oh so creepy).It is as if I were in the group. The movie tempts me: 'Rei, what would have you done in this situation?' That's why it's so great and I preferred it so much.After seeing it for the evening of course I couldn't get to sleep. I actually myself got going in the genre, so I put some fragments of classics, The Exorcist and The Shinning. Apart from just scenes in which the scare is inevitable, these look like toy inventions: they want to find a better way of scaring you. They just pale in comparison...I don't mean to ignorant, but 'Blair Witch' is something that gets a special place in one's memory. It's a story. It's not a directed story, the interesting facts in and cinematic achievement to be remarked. It's a story that gets you gripped and it has full effect. After watching it think about the 'educational experience part'! If somebody asked me about my scariest movie or horror films, I'll just suggest them to see 'The Blair Witch Project'. A mandatory experience, in my opinion.",9,4,7,15 September 2008
Barry Lyndon," Just sumptuous
","I regard Barry Lyndon as a highly distinct film. As I have seen many 20 years olds like me commenting on the film, I was motivated to respond.The first complain that comes to mind is the narration. This is a told story, not one when the viewer is left to discover the outcomes from its characters' adventures. And - mind you - it is a narrated movie par excellence. So some viewers are bothered when events are described before they actually happen, including the ending. I think this is the beauty of it. We here assume the role of the admirers. We contemplate the scenes, discover the smell of the era. Kubrick knows this is not a movie that needs to move fast, because it has a remote subject. The viewers are left the necessary moments to relate and comprehend the events that happened in times when man lived quite a different life. A life candlelit by night, instable and war-struck, insecure. The family theme is at a sad period. Duels are occur on an almost daily basis, and their leading to death is treated awkwardly... fair.Most of these are surely elements that we have to believe, in some sense be hypnotized in order to believe them. Ultimately this lead us to see that the values implied are timeless. One is left pondering at the end on this matter: what elements (life stages, truth and lies, courage, etc) are still present today, and in what form, with what consequences, etc.? This exercise is mandatory for a great movie - even if Barry Lyndon is indeed a story, it is not the straightforward story.All in all I believe we are presented a solid fragment of life from the 18th century. It is just for its complexity, its ups and downs, the long and winding road that its main character follows that mark this effort a candidate for a masterpiece.Try seeing it as gentle and appealing introduction to history, painting and music!",9,3,6,12 October 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," The Picture of Freedom
","Shawshank Redemption is great picture. (My remark) is also an annoying cliché. I am not the first person to daydream and then write why this is the best-loved movie either.The top movies are: a) War dramas/ b) Wild West masterpieces/ c) Pop Culture. The latter category is populated especially by Mafia movies, stories about capable people hidden from the eyes that govern most people's lives. Movies about the most successful of us that live their own way. In other words, Cool films.Alright, so what is 'Shawshank' doing among these? My take is that Shawshank touches a key in every one of us, and that key sounds as a description of freedom. It has no subtle, hidden messages. It's not cool. It's plain, straightforward. It has -though, this subject that may be the most sought right in the history of man. We always say after we pass a bleak period of our lives that it's good to know a deeply low and depressing moment since you know it cannot be worse. Well, that's the feeling I get about Shawshank's resonance.In some sense, I find a comparison basis with The Beatles. Why were the latter the best ever music group? Well, because they were so simple yet so effective. Does music or film has to have a deep hidden message? Music and film must impress, first and foremost. Why we are most of the time preoccupied of making a difference from other people through our preferences, separating ourselves by fake elitist values, instead of creating something our own (in some sense 'our own, together'), making us known through our very names. But I digress and I apologize for maybe wasting your time.The bottom line is not that Shawshank is the best, but that it is a favorite, a loved picture, like many others. Don't we have to give a ten to oh-so-many others without being able to give it more. Likewise it impresses us that at the end credits we just keep silent just to not be clichéd. At least we come here and write reviews...",9,0,0,23 September 2008
