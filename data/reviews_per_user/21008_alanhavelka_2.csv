Blade Runner 2049," One for the Ages
","Blade Runner 2049 is certainly one of the greatest films I've seen this year, if not ever. First of all, the acting. For me, this is one of Ryan Goslings finest performances in a motion picture ever. I don't think that Gosling receives enough praise for his performance. People sometimes call it 'one dimensional' or 'not special in any way' however he embodies his character masterfully. 'K' is a replicant living in a bleak dystopia, killing his kind for a living. Why should he be portrayed as a funny, goofy detective if there is literally no purpose in his life other than 'retiring' replicants. And when K finally finds his purpose in life, Goslings acting showcases every emotion felt seamlessly. Another great thing about this film was the cinematography, however the best way to describe it is the name Roger Deakins. Truly a oscar worthy showcase of skill. Next up the effects were so great that I didn't find myself questioning them even once throughout the film. And last but not least, the score. Hans Zimmer is a master qt work and this was one of the greatest soundtracks he has ever made. All in all Blade Runner 2049 is a well acted, masterfully scored visual masterpiece amd one of the best sequels ever made, thus receiving a perfect 10/10 score.",9,4,10,1 September 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Wow
","BlacKkKlansman is a well paced, fun yet emotional masterpiece. There is a perfect balance between comedy and drama. The use of parallel editing is masterfully executed and the acting is just phenomenal. This film should definitely be on every cinemagoers watchlist. BlacKkKlansman is shaping up to be one of this years greatest movies receiving a perfect 10/10 score from me.",10,9,18,1 September 2018
