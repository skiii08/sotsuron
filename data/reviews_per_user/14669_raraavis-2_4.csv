Marie Antoinette," Strictly for the drive-in crowd
","The clothes and settings are very good. And that's about it. Most of the characters don't look French, but clearly Anglo-Saxon, particularly in the way they move. The sound track is awful, with the modern tunes destroying any hope of losing yourself in the movie. I suppose that was considered 'cute' or 'cutting edge' by the director, but the result is a total sense of disbelief in the spectator.In general, boring and pretentious. The fact that it got one or two Oscars (not sure and could not be bothered to check) confirms how bad it is, Oscars being in general the kiss of death. Could be OK to watch with the sound turned off since, as I said at the beginning, it IS visually appealing.Am sure it'll do well in the drive-in circuit, if any drive-ins still exist.",2,2,3,23 July 2008
The Reader," A good European movie
","The movie appears to be a Germany/USA production, with a British director, yet its pace and mood are absolutely European (it could have been a French movie). I won't explain the plot, as it's been described elsewhere, but I must say that it kept me engrossed.I think, however, that the silly habit of having 'foreigners' speak in English with the accent of their countries should be eliminated: these are Germans supposedly speaking in German with each other. OK, we hear them in English, but that's for the benefit of English-speaking audiences. Why should they have a foreign accent? They're supposed to be speaking - I repeat - in their own language. This is an anglocentric quirk that should be stopped.All in all, an excellent, atmospheric movie.",8,1,1,18 January 2009
Casino Royale," The first 'Bond' movie that's bored me to tears...
","Bond for the mindless set: no class, no elegance, no humor, a Bond who looks extremely ill at ease in a dinner jacket, violence for violence's sake, endless explosions and fights... in fact, just another car-chases-explosions-and-guns film of the kind that Hollywood cranks out by the dozen, even if this one wasn't made in Hollywood. I yawned through it and left before the end. This movie has been clearly aimed at a different market, at a public that consumes tons of popcorn and chats on mobiles (cellphones) while watching a movie. It is, you might say, a 'chav' Bond. Daniel Craig would be more believable as a truck driver than as a classy character such as the real Bond we all knew and loved.If you are a Bond fan, stay away from this garbage.",3,16,28,8 February 2008
Atonement," Much ado about nothing
","I decided to see Atonement when I saw its trailer: nice shots, life in England just before WW2, an interesting human drama, etc. I began to worry a little bit when I heard a critic say that 'it is in The English Patient territory' - a film I deeply disliked - and worried even more when I read comments saying that Atonement would be a strong candidate for an Oscar, since Oscars are awards given on the basis of the commercial success of films, instead of their artistic merits.My worst fears were confirmed: Atonement is a pretentious but ultimately vacuous film. It reminded me of that famous line, 'he didn't say anything, but he said it so beautifully!'. It is very well shot, the actors are decent - if a little bit wooden - the locations magnificent and its basic plot is fine. But it never involves you. I found myself yawning, making shopping lists in my head and wondering what time it was.The plot? Without giving away anything important (not that there is anything much to give away) the film turns around a13-year old girl who, through a mixture of naiveté and jealousy ruins the life of a young man and many years later tries to make amends for it. It takes place in the late 30s and the 13-year old girl is one of the daughters of an upper middle class, wealthy family: beautiful country house, gardens, servants, the whole British cliché. The boy whose life is ruined is the son of one of the caretakers, but he's been taken under the wing of the family, has gone to good schools and is planning to study medicine at Cambridge, which means he knows how to wear a dinner jacket (when he's not carrying suitcases for weekend visitors).The problem is that the movie tries to be 'arty' while having mass appeal. It uses quite a few fashionable tricks, such as an unorthodox sound track (lots of typing noises), high volume sound effects and long, 'artistic' tracking shots. It never manages to involve spectators in the events that it describes and, ultimately, it's but a pretentious and shallow attempt to describe the way some people lived in England at the time. Uninteresting, boring and fake. Or, to quote the classics, 'much ado about nothing'.",4,23,47,12 September 2007
