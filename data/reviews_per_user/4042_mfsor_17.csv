The New World," Astonishing
","The lushness of early Virginia, the beauty of an English garden were the two highlights of this film. Smith could have talked some more, that would have livened up this movie. Nevermind. Just the sense of being in Elizabethan (everybody European grew up under her) first colony was impressive. I don't know why some reviewer thought Pocahantas was anti-Christian or anti-European just because she prayed a little bit out the mansion window. She said that the garden was where her deceased mother was and that's deeper.The Indians seemed too over-painted, but I don't know the history of that myself. They looked too much like NFL designs. The surprise of the Indians when the ships arrived was also very well done. It dragged a bit during the middle. Kilcher is a superb actress. My very high rating is for the authenticity I felt.",9,4,9,2 February 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Middling melodramatic
","First off, they killed the one person who wasn't a killer, using him for the Kansas City Shuffle, so good-guy/bad-guy is out the window and the film sucks. Any film that does that sucks. They didn't have to. It wasn't necessary. With all the inventivness this film had, all the dei ex machina, all the do-what-you-want-and-nobody-will-notice, they didn't have to kill that guy so gratuitously. Well, you say, Bruce Willis was that kind of guy. So, okay, this film glorifies murder, then. Just shock, that's all that this film was about. The two guys living opposite each other in penthouses? That's supposed to make the film believable? It's like the noise filmmakers use now to substitute for ideas.",3,10,27,7 April 2006
United 93," Really scary
","This film was frightening because it showed how vulnerable we really are. I was nervous before it started and nervous all the way through. The ending was totally objective, showing the vicious killers chanting in Arabic while the innocent victims prayed the Our Father and phoned their loved ones. And that's the difference between us and them. Yes, there was all the mess with the FAA and the military and lack of preparedness, but the true story was with the passengers who showed themselves to be great American heroes who saved our national capital. They knew what had gone on before and they decided to live their last moments according to the great traditions of American identity. That's was was great about the film: it showed that identity objectively. If anyone thinks the Islamic murderers were equal to the American heroes, that person is not a child of the Enlightenment and our American history.",10,0,3,3 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Good graphics, often exciting, often boring
","Okay, I'll go up to six because of the terrific graphics. But it ended up as a big octopus pummeling boats, and that's not good film-making. Sure, Depp was great, the natives-eat-the-chief sequence was funny, and Bill Nighy as Davy was fabulous. But too often, nothing really was happening, and it certainly was hard to get into Bloom's relationship with Barnacle Bill (although that was a good character). Long periods went on without anything really interesting happening, and that's what kept it from being a really good movie (despite the grand numbers of people who went to see it). The bad English lord, or whatever he was, conflicted with the master of the briny deep, and that kept it confusing. The attention to detail everywhere was outstanding, I will admit to that. Up to 7. Not, because there was still too much boredom for long stretches.",6,1,2,11 July 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Superb
","This movie was somewhat boring during the first half, even though there is beautiful mountain scenery. Maybe if you're gay, you think the interaction between the characters is interesting enough. The movie is about this interaction, and after their first summer together, it follows their relationship is a serious and intelligent manner. Their relationships to their wives is shown in the same manner. The difference between them is also portrayed with detail and sensitivity. Heath Ledger does a superb job in his Gary Cooper-like non-talking cowboy. I did enjoy the movie very much. It was about the development of a romance, but the fact that it showed scenes of them getting together every few years made me think it would have worked better as a long novel (yes, I know it was based on a short story).",7,5,17,7 January 2006
Match Point," Rehash
","The lead male is a really good actor; Johansen is a competent professional, but not a great actor. The story is a rehash of A Place In the Sun (Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Shelley Winters). I liked the idea of luck, and the ring/tennis ball thing was clever. They skimped on locations and variety of scenes, everything happening inside the same apartments. It took a long time for this movie to get going. I also question the ability of the lead actor to carry out the gruesome actions he did. There was a disconnect between what it would take to do it, and the rest of his feelings shown in the other scenes of the movie. Too many extreme close-ups. Liked the old opera recordings.",5,1,9,12 January 2006
We Were Soldiers," Breathtaking
","As a war movie, this was breathtaking, showing heroism on the part of soldiers, which is what war movies do. The ending where Kinnear shows up and zaps the North Vietnamese with Gatling guns. Where were these guns before? The artillery did a great job, and the ability to call in air strikes almost instantaneously was amazing. In the story arc, it was interesting to contrast the Mel Gibson plan, which he learned from the French who did it wrong by being passive, to take the battle to the enemy when they least expect it. If we had not given up politically, we could have won the war in Vietnam. Sam Elliott was his usual great gruff self. Mel was often melodramatic and the women back home were stereotypes and Madelaine Stowe had the worlds biggest lips.",8,1,2,4 June 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Average predictable
","Now, of course, Streep and Tucci, you can't do any better than that, but anyone of a dozen girls could have done Hathaway's part and the predictability level of this was just to obvious. The set of friends she had, is that a clich√© or what? Couldn't they do anything different. Hathaway went too quickly into the couturier mode; she should have taken more time and there should have been many more outfits. After all, that is what all these women dragged their guys into. Even the six women in front of us with their bodies covered from head to toe were there for the fashion. There was too much sameness to all the incidences with Streep, who should have warmed sooner to Hathaway.",6,0,0,1 July 2006
The Illusionist," Excellent Mood
","People sat in the theater afterward, staying in the mood, and of course trying to keep in mind all the things that the ex-inspector had just stated about how the Illusionist got away with the love of his life. It has been a long, long time since we had to be in a line for a movie, but this one had the mood, the photography, the serious story line to keep your attention as it played itself out. Of course the magic wasn't real, i.e., it was too good for anyone to have done it in reality, but we went along with it because we believed in the love story. And the love story was seriously done, and was the heart of the movie from beginning to end. And not just some sex thrown in.",10,2,3,18 August 2006
World Trade Center," Heroic
","This movie could have been so many other things, about terror, about construction, about a city. But it was about people who offered up their lives because they loved other human beings. It was a perfect movie for Nicholas Cage, who can be so serious in his dedication. It showed what we have expected about New York public servants, who went in to try and save others no matter what the cost to themselves. the most moving part of the film was just before the collapse, when they met all the firemen going into the towers to their deaths. Equally impressive was the way the rescuers were portrayed. It was great that they didn't show anything the terrorists did, all you got was what New Yorkers saw after the fact.",10,4,10,12 August 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Enjoyed very much
","I don't know why there is all the British fuss over the ending. It's a film it's not a photographed transcript of the novel. I wanted them to get together and declare their love for each other because the entire movie, and the novel for that matter, was inexorably moving that way. I felt that the faults of the characters were their real faults, and not the fault of scripting, acting or directing. I liked the settings; the smallness of most of the interiors of the houses was very real to me. It makes me wonder whether one could do a real, complete but modern Pride and Prejudice. Of course all the Regency scenery was terrific. The photography was beautiful, the close-ups nicely done, the family interactions enjoyable.",8,1,2,7 December 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Great, if predictable and confusing
","I didn't read the book, so I don't know if this follows the same line. I did start to read it but couldn't keep on going once I realized that it was just a scavenger hunt for clues. Towards the end, there was no other possible outcome than Ms. Tautou being the descendant of J.C. But the ending was very climactic. And the very very end didn't make any sense because it was using the I.M. Pei pyramid, which was a hell of a lot later than the clues were done. And what was the grandfather doing humping that girl with all the masks looking on? And the church, all its money, and it can only come up with Silas to do the dirty work of protecting the secret? Why didn't the girl get a book deal at the end? The clever historical scenes, especially the people at the time of Newton's death, were truly magical cinematic elements. I was born on Christmas Day. Why not make a movie about me?",8,0,1,23 May 2006
The Departed," Excellent fantasy
","Of course fantasy. You don't kill off that many state cops. If you did, the FBI would take over the whole state, or at least the whole state police operation. Even just the first one could get you that. DiCaprio was much better than Matt Damon, had a much greater range of emotion. He's clearly an actor with much greater depth. Jack Nicholson was his usual terrific scene, and in one of 'em, screwed up his face to talk about a rat and got half the audience laughing because Nicholson reinstated disbelief when he got too vintage Nicholsonian. And the text messaging all over the place? You got to be kidding. And that old standby was there: the video camera didn't work. Several other things that add up to fantasy, not a crime story.",7,2,4,6 October 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Logically moving
","It was a great premise and a great exit. I mean the ending depends on the narrator realizing something about a character which changes the narrator's view, personal attitude towards, the character. Once the fated character accepts his fate because it is good, the character becomes more than a fictional character and cannot be destroyed. This is the way gods view humans, as beings which can be saved if they have certain good characteristics. Using the writer as a god is an excellent tool to bring this idea across. Thus, the whole logic of the film is moving for the audience, i.e., the audience realizes at the end that the altruistic character cannot simply suffer at the hands of a god. Which is logically clever because it allows the narrator to change the original fate of the character.",8,0,2,11 November 2006
The Great Escape," Dated
","This is 2005, more than forty years after the movie was made. I would say the major difference between this and modern films is the way the prisoner of war camp seemed to be more like a cheap motel, with lots of privacy for the prisoners, seemingly pretty nice Germans in charge (granted, they were wearing blue, so it may have been a WWII Grand Illusion interplay), easy to get supplies for the escape. But everything was just too easy, again something of the sixties films. The movie was really about temperamental conflicts while building the tunnel, but these were based on stereotypes of characters, not real emotional differences. But, it's a classic, so I watched more of it than I really should have.",4,12,44,8 January 2006
Click," Boring
","There weren't enough click gags to keep this going, and the stupid sentimental stuff at the end seemed to drag on forever. Too bad, because the idea was quite good, and Sandler is good at what he does, although he's doing like the old Jerry Lewis comedies which always ended up towards the end moving into sentimental sloppy sorry stuff. Walkien was terrific, the family was cute, and it was nice to see a movie which sent the message that family life is what's best for us (to the extent we identify with Sandler, which isn't to many.) Anyway, we only watched it because the other movie possible we'd already seen, the Lake House, which also was on a love theme, that it's good to wait a couple of years for the one you love, but was also predictable, but in fact more believable than this one. Well, it's not about believability, but just about being able to show more creativity.",4,2,7,25 June 2006
Donnie Darko," Intriguing
","The movie appeals more to a younger audience because so much of it is based on rebellion. The stupid principal, the stupid teacher, the stupid Patrick Swayze, the stupid parents (the mother and father listening to extreme gross language at the dinner table), all this is what would appeal to people who do not yet know who they are and don't want older people to have any say in it. But, the idea of a guy who was so self-absorbed and learned one of the great scientific ideas ever (time travel) and then used it to save the life of his girlfriend, while also juvenile, was nevertheless kind of impressive. Great coincidences (the engine, the wallet), gutsy scenes (under hypnosis near-auto-eroticism) and Jake Guyllenhal is always interesting to watch.",8,0,1,8 January 2006
