Iron Man 3," Most entertaining comic book movie I have watched
","So, Iron Man 3 is excellent and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It is by far my favorite Iron Man movie and I may have enjoyed it slightly more than the Avengers. The movie is brisk and damn funny. The action is great and I LOVE that TONY STARK is the star. The twist, hilarious. The villain, great. I liked the battles with the bads and the chemistry between all the characters. Im not putting many details, but I will say I have always liked Shane Black and his signature is ALL OVER this movie. From the Christmas theme, to the plucky kid its all there. Im sorry but it just works, if you like to laugh and enjoy fun then this movie will be the best thing out this summer. Loved it in every way.",10,9,21,30 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good, not great.
","This movie starts out great. It looks great, has great music and has me hooked from the beginning. I have little knowledge of old Star Trek so everything was fresh in interesting for me. Then it began to become Deja Vu from the first Abrams Star Trek. The movie almost presents the exact same setup as the first at this point. I guess its the second act that lost me a little, as twists and turns are literally telegraphed to the viewer. Moments that are meant to be sincere are rendered pointless, when EVERYONE knows whats going to happen. Even with all the clich√©s I enjoyed the movie, just got bored near the end. I will watch it again but after one viewing i'll say above average movie. Very strong first half followed by weak second half. Also the crowd I was with loved every minute, so I am sure there is plenty for Trek fans.",7,10,28,9 May 2013
