Hereditary," A breathtaking masterpiece
","It is definitely not a horror movie for an average person. Ari Aster composed a true piece of art which is fullfilled with terrific acting, interesting plot and atmosphere of fear. Must watch for a real horror fan",10,1,3,27 February 2020
Fury," Great movie, but the ending sucks
","The whole movie was really brilliant. True face of war was shown to us, there is mug, death and blood everywhere, troops are frustrated and shocked.
But the ending... It seemed stupid even for a person who is not a military expert. Why did the tank crew allow Nazi to surround it? Why didn't they shoot them using heavy weapon while they were marching?
Overall, this movie is one of the best WWII movies, I'm just disappointed about the ending",8,0,4,6 March 2020
Get Out," The most racist movie I've ever seen
","The movie is so anti-white, that I couldn't even imagine that such movies can be created in 21st century, until I watched it. Yes, the actors play good, but the plot is so primitive and there are so many cliches about white people, that I wanted to vomit. White people are displayed as soulless monsters, there are no positive white characters at all! I'm 100%-sure, that if black and white people switched places in this movie, it would be criticized all over the media",1,12,19,13 December 2019
The Descent," Screamer, bad acting, screamer and repeat
","This movie is a huge disappointment.
The acting is not definitely okay: the girls look terrified and the next second they have a 'Rambo-face', ready to kill and eat their enemies' hearts alive.
I understand, it was 2005, but CGI in a scene with bats is so funny that I was literally crying. Caves don't look so good and in some scenes I thought that it was a videogame back from 2002.
Creatures are not scary at all, they're not so dangerous, their nature wasn't shown or explained enough to get interested.
I'm not sure that I was quite emphatic for at least one character. They're all boring and not catchy.
Overall: one-time popcorn movie, better choose one of Aster's movies to play with your nerves.",3,3,5,7 January 2020
