Come and See," Didn't effect me but I can still appreciate this film.
","Unfortunately for myself, I was not effected by this movie like most people were. When I saw this movie the audience thought it was the most intense movie they had ever seen, but for me it had no effect; I feel that it's because I have seen this story and cinematics done time and time again. Perhaps if I would have seen this movie before I saw the other countless war movies I would have had a different reaction. Regardless, I can appreciate this film; Klimov has a great message about Russian spirit during the war in this movie, he showed the bravery of the people from these small towns, and how they were able to fight off the Nazi's despite their inferior weapons and training. Anyone who likes war movies with a great story and message should watch this movie.",7,2,3,1 June 2012
