The Ring," Dated as of April 16, 2005
","First of all, I don't get it. I've seen plenty of horror movies, all surpassing the scariness of this movie. This movie just isn't scary to me. First of all, I only counted about five scenes of actual scariness. The ending was a joke, so bad that I didn't even need to hide my eyes. I just seen Amityville Horror and before that I seen The Grudge. I went to the grudge and that movie was pretty much like the ring except the scariness was turned up about 50 decibels, containing about 30 scenes of fright and chills. I went to see Amityville horror and the the scariness is up to 100 decibels, possibly the scariest movie of all time. I challenge anyone to go see these two movies and then, THEN, then tell me The Ring is scarier. I'm sorry, but The Ring is The Hype. Same goes for The Exorcist too.",Null,0,1,16 April 2005
