Blade Runner 2049," What happen here?
","I am always concerned about remakes of classic films many years after the original was released. This film confirms my concerns. It is slow, disjointed and really is a far cry from the original.",5,3,5,6 July 2018
"I, Tonya"," It wasn't as bad as my rating
",The acting in the film is quite good. I would give that part an 8. The down side is the movies massive attempt at painting Tonya Harding in a good light. I still feel she was a great part of her own demise.,5,1,4,6 July 2018
Cast Away," A Stunning Film
",It's hard not to become emotional if you can put yourself into the characters in this film. What happens when the man you love disappears only to resurface 5 years later? The soundtrack is so perfectly written for the film. It evokes many feelings throughout the film.,10,0,0,6 July 2018
Mother!," Still don't understand
","Even after seeing the movie and reading articles about what it is supposed to be about, I still don't under stand it. It's a tough film to watch and my best guess is that it is an art house type film. Yes scary at times but really full of allegories.",3,0,1,23 July 2018
