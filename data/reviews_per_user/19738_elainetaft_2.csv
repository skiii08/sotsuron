It," The trailer looked great, the film is not
","I am very surprised that this film got such a high ranking. I enjoy the books, films and TV shows of Stephen King but found that this film fell way too short. The trailer looks great and Pennywise the clown looks terrifying so I was really looking forward to seeing this, but after watching this film which is over 2 hours long I could not wait for it to finish,I was waiting for it to get better but it does not - there was no scare factor whatsoever I just found it a bit boring and such a let down. I really feel this should have just gone straight to DVD - way over hyped.",3,175,338,12 October 2017
Hereditary," Rubbish
","Well this is 2 hours of my life I can't get back. I was so looking forward to this film and I cannot believe the high rating and amazing comments this film is getting,
Don't waste your money - boring.",1,20,46,16 June 2018
