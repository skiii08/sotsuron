Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Borrrrrrrrrinnnnggggggggg!!
","God, this was dull! Hmm, another bumbling muppet race defeats a technologically superior force, even though most of them don't know what they're doing! A saber fight at the end of the film -- well, I can forgive that one, at least it was well done. The effects are great, but what big-budget movie doesn't have nice looking effects now? The characters are just bland as hell, that's all. Liam Neeson picked up a big paycheck for this one, that's all.",Null,0,1,28 May 1999
Apocalypse Now," Metaphorically, a better adaptation of Conrad than most give it credit for
","And metaphorically is how one must approach this movie. Just as imperial European powers confronted their 'hearts of darkness' deep in the African continent, the United States finally had to confront its own in the jungles of Vietnam. But if moral judgement was all Coppola had been trying to do, this would be remembered only as a pretty good film. What makes it a great one is that Coppola, following his character Kurtz's advise, does not judge, either the individuals in the film (including Kurtz) or the U.S. as a whole. I do not see this film as an overt condemnation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, just a brilliant look at the ramifications of that involvement. Nor is it an anti-war picture in any blatant way -- the attack on the Vietnamese village led by Kilgore and his choppers can be viewed several ways, depending upon what one's own feelings are. War is glorious, futile, exhilarating, chaotic, and savage all at the same time, and that sequence, the best shot sequence ever put on film, is all of it at once.Finally, the use of music and sound in the film was incredible! From Wagner and the 'superman-esque' scene we gradually evolve into a haunting almost new age sound before ending up with, fittingly, 'The End' by the Doors. Along the way, Coppola builds up the appearance of Kurtz to an almost unbearable level; then Brando's off-beat, off-rhythm performance fits the almost un-earthly landscape Sheen and crew find themselves in.
I don't know if this is the best film ever made, but its damned close!",Null,0,0,5 January 2000
American History X," The strength of the movie is the actors
","I will agree with those who say that the movie could have been better. There's an annoying tendency in movies lately to try and build drama with slow-motion photography and/or music from the soundtrack in painfully obvious ways. ('Does everyone understand this is a dramatic moment'? {music crashing in the background, people running in slo-mo}) AMX falls into that habit occasionally and deserves a few demerit points for it.But forget all of that and watch the actors. All of them did an excellent job in this film. Norton is definitely the star of the show and deserves the praise he has received. The hateful gleam in his eye as he's being arrested was almost messianic. I also thought Avery Brooks did a fine job with his role, which all in all was too brief. He should have gotten more screen time.Another plus for the film was that it usually didn't pull any punches. I mean, if you're going to look at the hateful, violent side of life, look at it. It also didn't get overly preachy, showing that even skinheads and gangbangers are seldom monsters through and through, just people with a lot of anger looking for answers in the wrong places. It is very graphic at times, with one death scene and one rape scene that are particularly brutal, but not sensationalized.All in all, a good film. As with any film, you should appreciate what it is artistically first, then worry about any 'message' second. AMX's message is obvious, and I doubt very many people, outside of neo-nazis and the Klan, are going to be upset by it.",Null,0,0,30 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Very effective filmmaking
","After scanning some of the other comments, I think I'm more disturbed by some of them than I am this film! First of all, the battle scenes are spectacular, particularly the invasion sequence. (None other than John Keegan, famed war historian, has said that it is as realistic as your going to find on film.) Some here have criticized it for being to 'amero-centric' (I guess that's a word?) because the soldiers are all American. This is not a fair criticism -- the soldiers landing on Omaha and Utah beaches WERE all Americans. The other beaches, Gold, Juno, and Sword, were landed upon by British and Canadian soldiers mostly. If you're going to criticize a movie, do it for it is, not what it is not. Of course, many other nations participated in WWII, but because they're not seen does not invalidate this film. The men who landed at Omaha beach were by far the hardest hit. The Normandy battles were not as large as Kursk, for example, but celebrating one battle does not somehow invalidate the rest. Criticizing it for that is childish and petulant. The movie does slow a little in the middle, but I did not see any 'mushy Hollywood' type movie making. Your stereotyped Hollywood picture has a big soundtrack and lots of gratuitous pyrotechnics -- this movie had none of that. I have often criticized some of Spielberg's films in the past, but I have none to offer this film. It's not perfect (no film is) but its very good. An indirect kudos to Stanley Kubrick, whose influence I saw in a couple of scenes. Maybe that's just me, but it seemed 'Kubrickian' in a quiet, indirect sort of way.",Null,0,0,5 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Differing perspectives...
","I've noticed that most of the people who didn't like the film are from outside the United States. That's not unusual, I think; the movie would have more of an emotional appeal to Americans. But using a movie to voice your own rather bigoted attitudes toward a country is hardly becoming. World War II was a defining moment for the United States, and a very emotional one as well. Americans can be justifiably proud of what the United States accomplished during the war, just as Russians and Brits can be proud of what sacrifices were made on their behalf. I don't like chest-thumping jingoism any more than anyone else, but I honestly did not see that here. I saw pride, not arrogance. I saw American soldiers act cowardly, and German soldiers show mercy. Mostly I saw how combat has a debilitating effect on human beings, regardless of how 'noble' the overall purpose is. World War II began in Europe, it did not begin with or in the United States. Any latent militarism or patriotism caused by the effects of two world wars on American culture ultimately owes its existence to the people responsible for starting those wars in the first place. I don't believe, however, that this movie or Tom Hanks intention in making it was vapid patriotism, anymore than his 'From the Earth to the Moon' or Ron Howard's 'Apollo 13' were. Some patriotism is legitimate -- dying to end fascism and the Holocaust, in my books, rates as legitimate.",Null,1,2,10 November 1999
A Clockwork Orange," From the Master!
","Only Kubrick could have pulled this movie off. Others have tried similar films; 'Natural Born Killers' leaps to mind, and it wasn't all bad, but Stone is the apprentice compared to Kubrick. I realize that some people will automatically turn away from this film due to its violent content. I've never understood why people are so squeamish about seeing play-pretend violence being acted out (excuse me, its not real!) but to each his own. If you're one of those people, well, you've missed out on one of the best films ever made. Kubrick's ability to etch both images and sounds into the viewers mind is probably without comparison. While some fans of the Burgess novel may have been upset at some of the liberties taken, (just like Stephen King fans were with 'The Shining'), you can't dispute the product is outstanding.",Null,0,0,13 April 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A 'movie' movie
","Honestly, as much as I've enjoyed Kubrick's stuff through the years, I put off watching this one, just because I thought I was going to hate it.I didn't.'Eyes Wide Shut' is a superb film. It isn't in the 'Strangelove/2001/Clockwork Orange' stratosphere; I think the best comparison to another Kubrick film would be 'Barry Lyndon.' Both 'Eyes' and 'Lyndon' are period pieces, both are beautiful to look at, both move very slowly (and thus turn many people off), and both are only indirectly 'about' anything. In 'Lyndon,' we saw the life of a rags-to-riches-to-rags Irishmen. Here, we see a few days in the life of a wealthy American couple. What is the hardest thing to do in life today, if you're a wealthy person in our post-modern world? Stay interested? Separate reality from fantasy? That seems to be what Kubrick was saying, at least that's what I heard in the film. Of course, the sexual dynamic of man and woman is the most obvious theme, but I'll be different and state that I don't think that's really what the film is about. Kidman and Cruise's characters are so bored with life (and increasingly with each other) that they begin using sex as a weapon to tear into one another. Through a string of rather improbable events, they both 'survive' intact, and at the end they both realize they've been lucky. Both of them step back from the fantasy-land they were driving each other to, and turn to each other in the end. Actually, for Kubrick, a remarkably conservative statement, I think.Oh yes, maybe its just my somewhat indulgent sense of irony, but I for one think its wonderful that the last word ever spoken in a Stanley Kubrick film was 'fu_k.' Here's to ya Stanley.",Null,0,0,13 May 2000
