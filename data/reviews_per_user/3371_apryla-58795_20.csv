"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Run...away from this!
",I love Simon Pegg and I've seen just about everything he's been in and I gotta say this is one movie he was NOT able to save and it was not really that funny. I think this was kind of a bomb.I can't stand Hank Azaria I don't know why...something about the way he speaks-he has a lisp or something and he just looks so nerdy. I'm just really annoyed by him so he kind of ruined it for me.I did like Thandie Newton. She's always so good in everything and she's so beautiful. She has great screen presence. The little boy was adorable.I think this was David Schwimmer's directorial debut and you can tell. This just wasn't funny. It missed the mark and I don't recommend. Sorry David you're better acting as Ross.,3,0,1,27 December 2018
Insidious: Chapter 2," Yawn
",I seriously do not know who thinks this is scary. This was so bad. You could see Barbara Hershey's stunt double very clearly when she got pushed towards the end by Patrick Wilson. Angus Sampson & Leigh Wannell are so bad. They kept taking me out of the story with their lame attempts to be funny. Is this a comedy or a horror film?The constant back and forth with the storylines was giving me whiplash.The little kid who portrayed Patrick Wilson as a boy in the first movie was not the same one in this one. Continuity people...is that too much to ask for?This was a shameful embarrassment. I kept checking the time left on the movie I was so bored. This wasn't so bad it was good...it was just plain bad.Skip this!,1,0,0,21 December 2018
It," 'You'll die (laughing) if you try' (watching this film)
","I was fully expecting to be terrified while watching this. In fact I was so apprehensive about watching it that I put it off for a long time. I had even decided at one point that I would not watch it at all BUT I'm a horror film aficianado and I haven't seen a movie that has truly terrified me in so long that I finally gave in and decided to watch this with the hope that I'd be scared...alas with the exception of the first scene I was not scared. If anything I was laughing throughout the film.The kids do a pretty good job. The only two that didn't work were the actor who played Ben and the actor who played Mike. They were both pretty dull and boring. Any actor could have played those roles - they brought nothing special or unique to the film. You either have screen presence or you don't and those kids don't have it. I particularly liked the kid who played Eddie and the actress who played Beverly. They were both really good.I had an issue with a couple of scenes. One is the first scene. I don't like that they showed a small sweet innocent child getting his arm ripped off and then dragged into the sewer. That was very chilling and disturbing especially because the child actor was so young and cute. That seemed gratuitous. The scene would have been just as scary without that because what made it terrifying was how creepy Pennywise was. The way he was trying to manipulate this trusting child was disturbing. They didn't need to show him writhing on the ground trying to get away after his arm was ripped off. I think that scene will haunt me but not because it was scary - it is more that it was just kind of heartbreaking to see a small child suffer. The child actor was so darn cute. It was upsetting to see him meet such a brutal end.The other issue I had is with the two scenes where Ben got cut pretty seriously yet he gets no medical attention. There's no way he could have survived the second attack without getting some major stitches. At the very least he needed the cuts cleaned and you never see that happen. In fact after he gets carved up the first time he runs through a bacteria filled stream of water which would surely have given him an infection yet he has no issues from that point on until he gets cut up again by Pennywise later on in the film. And where were his parents? You never see them. I didn't see the first It but I read that film's extensive synopsis and nowhere do they explain why the red balloon keeps popping up. I get that balloons go with clowns but so do fake squirting flowers, tiny cars and never ending handkerchiefs but you don't see those portrayed at any time throughout the films so...why one red balloon? The idea is that 'It' takes the form of whatever fear a person has and no one was scared of clowns except for Richie so why would 'It' keep popping up as a clown and why the red balloon?Also I would have liked to know more about the Pennywise back story. We get some but not much. It made it hard to be too afraid without knowing why we should be afraid. A town presence takes kids every 27 years...ok great but why?This film was actually funny. The kids had funny lines and some of their facial expressions and reactions were hilarious. There was so much hype about the prep Bill Skarsgard went through for this film and yet once you see it you wonder if they spent too much time overthinking it because really he's not that scary after the first scene. The ending was good. Usually horror film endings are lame, weak or cliche but this one worked really well and actually was a perfect setup for the next film. I'm looking forward to seeing that one. I would suggest watching this only if you want some good laughs but avoid if you're looking for something scary. I'm not clowning around...this kind of fell short and my search for a truly terrifying movie continues...",5,1,2,14 October 2018
Hereditary," What in the world????!!!!
",I don't even know what I watched just now. It seemed like this was the slowest movie ever. Some parts were so slow that towards the end I got to thinking 'Ok apparently the director just ran out of ideas and decided to drag each scene out way longer than necessary.' Thanks for not trying and for wasting our time.A few thoughts...Alex Wolff did not look like the rest of the family. Not sure why they couldn't find an actor who would have looked more like them. Also I can't tell if he's a good actor or not. The whole movie he was literally acting like he was stoned. Standing around with your mouth open does not a good actor make. Plus I know it's nitpicky but why with the mole? Just WHY?! Those things can be removed so it's beyond me why anyone would keep that on their face. It's all you can see when you look at him.Gabriel Byrne was so wasted in this. Why did they even bother with him or a Dad character at all if he was gonna be so minimal?! It was seriously like he wasn't there at all. Plus he looked like Toni Colette's Dad! They had zero chemistry. The age gap-what was that all about?The movie was so dark. I kept checking my screen to make sure it wasn't on nightlight or that I had accidentally turned it down.Toni Collette is usually a sure thing in every role she takes but this I felt was not her best work. I don't know why but it seemed like she didn't know how to do the scene with Gabriel Byrne at the fireplace. It was very awkward. She mostly just stood around with her mouth open.Milly Shapiro-is there something very wrong with her or did they go to extra lengths to make her look like a hobgoblin? I don't want to make fun of a little girl BUT I mean...what is going on with her? She was in this movie for a cup of coffee and that was it. Pointless.The whole family was a bunch of sadsacks. This movie wasn't scary - it was depressing watching them be so dysfunctional and bizarre and that was BEFORE everything went down. What a bunch of weirdos. They had absolutely nothing redeeming about them.Why would you make your teenage son take his sister to a party? Why didn't they make sure she wouldn't eat anything that would cause her throat to close while they were there? The mom just sends her off with the brother without any reminders about that.Why did the brother just go to bed instead of calling the police or his parents when Charlie's head came off?!What in the world was that stuff that Toni Colette was working on? It looked like she was working on something personal and also something for another art exhibit. That made no sense and was super creepy. Why was the grandmother just seen in photos? Why didn't they have flashbacks that showed her to make this more real. We don't know anything about these people therefore I didn't care when any of them died.I'm very disappointed that I wasted my time with this because I had heard it was terrifying and it was anything but! The ending?! I was laughing! It just went completely off the rails and made no sense. I don't even think I could begin to understand what this movie was about even if it was broken down in a very detailed description.Well...cluck cluck. I'm off to try to find something that is actually scary and not just plain DUMB.,3,2,7,11 January 2019
A Star Is Born," If THIS was the reason Bradley left Irina...
","Here's the good...Sam Elliott. LOVE THAT MAN! He can do no wrong. I'm so glad to see that he got nominated for awards and actually won some as they were well deserved. Ok sorry that was it for the good.I went into this thinking I would not be able to handle how amazing it was gonna be and then when it ended all I could think was...it lacked something. It reached high but fell way short.Lady Gaga is no Barbra Streisand. She wasn't terrible but she lacked that quality of 'I can't look away from this person.' I didn't feel the heat or intensity between Ally & Jackson.Joke and throw shade all you want but bottom line-Andrew Dice Clay is a good actor and I hope he gets good roles to work with in the future.Finally-Bradley Cooper's desperate need for validation was his undoing with this movie and in his personal life. I'm being very genuine when I relay that it truly makes me sad that he and Irina broke up over this because they have a daughter together and these are real people in that situation. And let's face it - this movie IS the reason they broke up and no one can convince me otherwise. How could it not be? If he had been my partner I would've bounced a long time ago. He didn't keep his personal life separate and now he's paying the price. Brad bet the house on this and he failed miserably. The fact that he didn't win the Oscar proves that. He was good in this but he took a huge gamble and it just didn't pay off. Don't feel too bad for him though he likes 'em young so no doubt he'll find solace in another one's arms soon.This isn't the worst movie but it felt very teenager-y and it lacked depth. It's hard to feel something for stars or singers who (pardon the pun) are 'Shallow Shallow'. Don't expect us to cry you a river if you have been given the keys to the castle and then turn around and blow it all on stupidness. Jackson kills himself in this version because he can't handle Ally moving on without him and he let some young music executive punk dictate to him what his wife feels-which may not have been the case. He (much like the actor
who played him) was so desperate for validation that it was his undoing in the end.I just couldn't get behind this one.",5,1,1,16 June 2019
About Time," Should be required watching
","A beautiful story about time travel and the importance of making every moment count.Domhnall Gleeson (perfect in this role) plays Tim who at 21 discovers from his dad (the brilliant Bill Nighy) that the men in the family can time travel. Although preposterous the movie is more about relationships and how doing one thing different can alter our lives forever. The film seems to drag a bit through the middle as you aren't really sure where it's going but by the last part of the movie it all comes together and it is so touching and sweet that it just makes you want to examine your life and your choices and move forward accordingly.The acting is so good. Everyone did a fantastic job. I can't see anyone else working in those roles. Bill Nighy is perfect in every role he takes on. I've loved him ever since Love Actually when his character said, 'And remember kids-don't buy drugs...become a rock star and they'll give them to you!' He embodies every role he's in and he makes you believe he's actually the person he's playing. He was so sweet in this role. He was so relaxed and I realized after the fact that he truly is brilliant because his character was living every day twice in order to fully appreciate it. This would have made him more at ease as a person because he'd already lived through it once and would therefore know what was coming.I'm not familiar with the actress who played the sister but she was very good in this as well as the actor who played Rory.This is not overly sappy but it has a great message and other than the time travel thing it plays out very realistically.Everyone should see this at least once.",10,1,1,1 February 2019
Deadpool 2," The name of this film was Deadpool right?
",Ok first off let me be clear - I love Ryan Reynolds so much! He is so funny and clever and just seems like a good dude. And I've loved Josh Brolin since Goonies BUT both of them were wasted in this film. Way too much time was spent trying to fit every single character into the story that it ended up being way too much. I was overloaded and I couldn't figure out what was going on. And the jokes?! They just kept coming and coming and coming...after awhile I was like Ok already! We get it. You're trying to be cute and clever and cheeky and use inside jokes and trying to be too cool for everything and OMG! Just shut up and present an actual story! You know what this felt like? It felt like I was watching 2 hours of a gag reel instead of a movie. And then to top it off this film was trying to make a statement with the girl power thing and the LGBTQ thing AND there's nothing wrong with that but is it relevent to this story? Cause it kind of seemed more like RR was just trying to throw everything against the wall hoping something would stick and those important issues got glossed over and didn't have an opportunity to be fleshed out. I think instead of bringing it to light they just kind of threw all of it in just so they could say they did and not because it was relevent to the storyline. I mean was it supposed to be relevant? I don't even know anymore because I'm not sure what this film was supposed to be about. I mean you'd think with the name of the film being Deadpool that it would focus more on him. Instead it was about Firefist. And by the way I don't care that the actor who played him was morbidly obese but I did care that he couldn't act. He was just plain annoying. I didn't feel anything for him and was disappointed that Cable didn't kill him. I mean he tried to so there is that.And Josh Brolin wasn't given much to do. With all the build up for his character prior to the release of the film I was so excited to see him on screen and then he was just rolling around on the ground for most of the film. We didn't even get a chance to really be invested in him as the 'bad' guy before he's turning around wanting to join forces. That just felt rushed. For all the hype they pushed about Cable prior to the release and all the work JB put in physically for this role he deserved a lot more than just rolling around on the ground and standing around trying like hell to look like he didn't have anything better to do. He can act but even he couldn't save this one. You know what I would have liked to see? A movie with the assembled team members they interviewed about half way in. Now those characters were interesting and fun to watch. I wanted more of them. Brad Pitt was the best thing about this film as the Vanisher. His less than two seconds of being onscreen was better than the rest of the movie. If they had just had a full two hours of Vanisher it would've been better than this mess. After a certain point I was no longer interested nor did I care if Deadpool lived or died and that's a shame because I loved the first Deadpool.This movie felt like that annoying acquaintance we all know that is always 'on' and when you finally get away from them you're just exhausted. There was too much going on with this film and the knowing looks and breaking of the 4th wall and inside jokes and 'nods to' this that and a million other things. It's not funny if the whole audience isn't in on all the jokes. When you have to read the notes from IMdB just to understand the movie you know you pry should have just skipped it.I do not recommend. Let Deadpool die. Make room for the X-Force team. Oh and definitely get 'Brown Panther' his own franchise - that dude is funny!,3,4,7,29 August 2018
Bird Box," It's about the Journey...not the destination
","This was great. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that really pulled me in and held my attention. I love when I finally hit on a good movie, but it's frustrating because they are few and far between.I have not read the book this is based on nor did I see The Quiet Place so I was in a position of being able to have an open mind when watching this film.The main thing many people don't realize or seem to be able to accept is that movies based on books will NOT follow the book to the letter. It's just not possible to film a movie the same way a book is written. Often times the book is just simply an idea and only a basis - the movie could go off in a hundred different directions. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad film but it can cause dissatisfaction to those who have read the book. That dissatisfaction turns into a critique of the film and the two can't be judged the same. It's not fair to the film when someone goes into it with a closed mind. It just taints the experience.I had an open mind so I took this movie for what it was. Sandra Bullock plays an artist who is basically one step away from being agoraphobic. When the movie starts she is heavily pregnant. Her sister (played by Sarah Paulson who was wasted in this role) brings groceries to Sandra and says that there is some weird thing happening overseas. People are committing suicide en masse and no one knows why. Sandra blows it off and says that it's not 'here' so she doesn't need to worry about it. There is also talk about the man who got Sandra pregnant. He's no longer in the picture.Next scene shows Sandra and Sarah at the doctor's office getting a sonogram. Sandra is very removed from her feelings and is ambivalent about her pregnancy. The doctor tells her that if she decides not to keep her baby she could opt to put it up for adoption.Next scene shows Sandra & Sarah leaving the doctor's office. As they are walking out things start to get weird. A woman is violently smashing her head into a window. Sandra is struck with the realization that whatever was overseas is now taking place where they are.Sandra gets in the car and tells Sarah to get going quickly. They head out but car crashes are happening and people are walking into traffic. Sarah starts driving erratically and Sandra is trying to stop her. Sarah crashes into a car and they flip over. When Sarah gets out of the car she walks in front of a bus and gets hit. After that it's mass chaos and Sandra is stunned from the accident and slightly in shock from seeing her sister die. Someone grabs Sandra and tells her she needs to keep moving. She stumbles along and keeps falling until finally a woman runs out of a house to help her. The woman starts to help her but then looks up and says, 'Mom...' and then proceeds to get into a burning car and die.A man (Trevante Rhodes who was great in this-his teeth are like chiclets they are so perfect and white AND his biceps had their own starring role in the film!) comes along to help Sandra and he leads her to the house the woman came from who was trying to help Sandra. After some initial resistance they are allowed to enter the house. The house belongs to B.D. Wong. John Malkovich is inside and his wife was the one who helped Sandra before dying-so he appears to despise her on sight.We are introduced to a cast of characters who largely served as nothing more than a way to progress the story. They were picked off one by one and since we aren't given an opportunity to get invested in them we feel nothing when they die.Sandra and Trevante form a bond almost immediately. They survive and continue on living for several years by making due with the resources available to them. They raise her son and a little girl who was left in her care after the Mom died shortly after giving birth (the Mom was one of the group of people who found her way into B.D. Wong's house. During her stay she asked Sandra to promise that she'd take care of her little girl should anything happen to her. Tom Hollander got to the room after she gave birth and ripped down the stuff covering the windows and she got exposed to the light without her blindfold and killed herself).There is something in the atmosphere that causes people to commit suicide when they open their eyes. We never see these entities. They are more like a presence. Sandra, Trevante and the kids wear blindfolds when they go outside.One day they hear a man over the walkie talkie asking if anyone is out there. Trevante answers against Sandra's better judgement. They find out there are survivors but they are about a two day trip away by boat.Sandra, Trevante and the kids set out for the commune. Before they get too far a band of people who can somehow survive without blindfolds attempt to kill Sandra & company. Trevante tells Sandra to go on ahead with the kids while he tries to slow the group down. He tells her he will join them as soon as he can. Things go sideways and Trevante ends up dying. Now Sandra must go on the journey with the kids without Trevante.For the rest of the movie we see Sandra and the kids as they are in the boat and also flashbacks of when they lived together in the house before Trevante died. The scenes are intense and keep you glued to the screen.I won't go into the rest of the film because the ending doesn't matter. People don't seem to get it...the movie is not about the destination. It's about how Sandra was able to keep her family together until they got to the commune. You see her struggle and fall apart briefly but ultimately she pulls herself together to get her children to safety. Look at it like this...there are unseen dangers facing us every day. Even though we can't always see what can harm us it doesn't matter. We do what we can to survive (no matter what we encounter) so we can keep our family intact. This film showed that perfectly.I think Sandra was great in this. I have liked her ever since Speed. Yes her face is starting to get a little too close to resembling a Dark Crystal character but she still looks fantastic.The little boy did not have much expression throughout the film so I can't say he did a good job but the little girl was great. I sure hope they weren't scared of Sandra while they were filming because she did not seem to be handling them with 'kid gloves'.This is not your typical Netflix drivel. This is more like a big screen film and I think it was very well done. The only issue I had that was out of left field and a bit contrived was when the doctor just so happened to be at the commune when they got there...um ok how?MGK spoiler-he is on screen for about 5 minutes...has about 5 lines, a sex scene and then we never see him again. It could've been anybody in that role.And finally here's a big spoiler for you...you do see what the creatures look like..they show you very plainly through Tom Hollander's drawings. It's called 'paying close attention'. It was all laid out on the table.Sandra just say no to any further cosmetic enhancements but definitely say yes to more acting...you are beautiful and talented. Nice job.",10,3,9,23 December 2018
American Psycho," 'I'm in Murders & Executions'
","Wow! Just wow! I have seen this movie 3 times since it's release. The first time I saw it I was largely shocked, disturbed, disgusted and wishing I could unsee it. BUT I also was blown away by Christian Bale's performance. Now...I have seen the videos and I've heard the rumors about him being difficult to work with etc...but you have to give credit where it's due - he was absolutely brilliant & amazing in this role. If you have not seen this film you truly have to experience it. I don't condone the goriness or the pornographic material or the extreme violence but viewing it is almost like a study of two things. First of all if for nothing else it's a master acting class. Secondly it's to see an actor perform the role of a lifetime in general but also to see the best performance I believe of Christian Bale's career. I haven't seen all of his films but I've seen most of them and I have to say that even though he is a great actor I don't think any of his other roles come close to this one. I would even go so far as to say that I think it's probably one of the best if not the best performance I've ever seen from any actor ever in all the films I've seen and I've seen a lot. Here is why I think that. He took what I think is possibly one of the most difficult characters to portray and he 1000% nailed it. I think Patrick Bateman would be one of the most difficult characters to portray due to that fact that not only did CB have to commit to this role physically (which is no small thing) he had to find some way to completely get inside the mind of a psychopath and portray that. This role was an extreme challenge because the Patrick Bateman character was acting himself so as to not give away that he was a psychopath. He knew that to be accepted in society he had to act. He was not being his true self so everything about him was an outward act. So not only did Christian Bale have to act like Patrick Bateman - he had to act like an idea of what Patrick Bateman thought he should act like! That is some serious material to master.The murder scenes are really where you see the truly brilliant talent. It's so terrifyingly unsettling because he kills his victims so violently yet the scene is juxtaposed with extremely over the top humor all while listening to popular upbeat music while it's happening. That is so much for the mind to take in. It's almost like your mind is overloaded and you can't deal with it. But as weird as it sounds it's beautiful to behold.I didn't think I'd ever watch it again but I did so several years later out of curiousity just to see if my reactions to it had changed...Nope! Still the same. And then several years after that viewing I watched it for a 3rd time the other night when my husband decided to watch it again because he hadn't seen it in years either and was curious to see what he thought after all that time had gone by. My reaction-about the same but yet with an even deeper appreciation of Christian Bale's performance.I had forgotten about all the other actors who were in it. They did well in their roles as well.This is one of the films that the more you watch it the more you pick up or notice. The one liners are great 'I've got to return some videotapes!' 'Have a holly jolly Christmas.' So funny! Plus there's other things that you pick up that you didn't notice in previous viewings such as - this time around I noticed that when Christian Bale's character goes to chase that hooker down the hallway he's completely naked yet he found time to put on tennis shoes before he started chasing her. I never noticed that before. Just imagining him putting on his tennis shoes before he goes to kill her it's just ridiculous! It is so funny to me and I completely missed that the last two times I watched it. It's just one more small detail that shows you inside the character's mind.I'm not one who gets into violence or the exploitation of women and oddly enough I can't even say I liked the film. But I can appreciate a great performance and while I could have done without a lot of those scenes they aren't just gratuitous. They really were necessary to portray this character.I would highly recommend this film.",10,1,1,26 August 2018
The Exorcist," I mean I guess at the time it was pry scary?
",This wasn't scary. I'm a horror film aficionado and I can't believe I've never watched this. I guess because it's been such a part of the culture for so long-all the spoofs etc...that I kinda felt like I had already watched it in a way.I would say this is more engrossing than scary. I just think some scenes went on for too long and don't see how they were necessary. The exchange between the Mom and daughter before bed the one night just went on and on and got to be uncomfortable. Kids aren't usually that enamored or lovey dovey with their parents like that. I could see if she had been much younger but she was supposed to be 11 in this and usually by that age they have started to separate physically and emotionally from their parents. It was kinda cringeworthy.The whole first part didn't seem integral to the story. The scene in the beginning went on forever but wasn't really explained. Why did we need Max Von Sydow? It was Jason Miller who was the main priest.The makeup was so over the top and fake that it just made it funny and not scary. I will say though that the bruise on Ellen Burstyn's face was very realistic looking and as it progressively got better you could still see it until it was barely there BUT that was a detail that many films today overlook. People get hurt in scenes in movies today and the next scene they have nothing. The directors today could take a page from this book in that regard. Continuity would seem like the easiest thing to keep track of between scenes but it's severely lacking in many of today's films.I loved the one scene where the doctor comes out to talk with Ellen Burstyn about her daughter as he lights up a smoke! Wow! We've come a long way since then right?Ellen Burstyn always struck me as an actress who is always angry in every role and I see that she hasn't changed much. She was so bi*chy to people in this. She's either like that IRL and isn't acting much or she's a really good actress cause she just seems like a mean nasty woman.My other issue with this is-after seeing what Linda Blair was portraying on the big screen I had to ask myself what kind of parents would allow a child to act in such a depraved film? It was very sexual and disturbing...not scary...more that it's just sick. I just don't think young children should be exposed to that kind of stuff. They are too young to process such heavy material. I guess people's morals go out the window along with the care and keeping of young children's impressionable minds and innocence when Hollywood comes calling or money is involved. Priorities seem messed up.This film def has a 70's vibe which of course comes across as very dated. I also don't get why Jason Miller was nominated for an Oscar for his performance. He had screen presence for sure and wasn't bad but he wasn't in the film that much and the scenes he had were brief. I get why Linda Blair was nominated but not him.Lastly I see that not much has changed as far as endings go with horror films. This seemed like a very ho hum ending. After all that happens they just drive away and the other priest is just standing near the site where Jason Miller died and that's it. I kept waiting to see them cut back to the dig at the beginning to show some other kind of artifact but nope just a priest standing and thinking...um ok? I mean eh.Overall I guess I'd recommend it if you want to see what others call a classic but honestly I don't see what the fuss is all about. You just must've had to have been there at the time to appreciate it.,5,1,3,8 January 2019
The Favourite," The rabbit that Emma Stone steps on should have got an Oscar
",So...wow! Um not sure what to make of this. I'll tell you one thing I know now for sure-I'm so glad I didn't live during those times. Life was so awful back then. The Kings and Queens were mostly immature bratty ignorant spoiled children and they ruled terribly. They were basically told what to do by their advisors (yes it's like that today too BUT besides a few bad apples most of our Presidents have been intelligent individuals who have had education and experience with the military. They had to prove they could lead the US before getting the job whereas back then they just got their positions because of their place in the family gene pool). It's awful how many people lost their lives to the guillotine by a lie or just a temper tantrum thrown by a King or Queen.I think this movie showed that no matter how you start out in life your station can change and you could find yourself becoming something you wouldn't normally due to the change in circumstances. And it doesn't have to always be negative. If you suddenly become rich you're most likely going to start acting and behaving differently because mindset comes into play. In this case one's station went down while the other one's went up and they both changed their actions accordingly. It must've been so hard to be at the whim of someone else's desires or wants and needs. The poor servants had it the worst! The women were violated sexually or beaten for slights. The men were yelled at by the Kings or Queens just because there was no one else around. What terrible horrible bleak lives they had.I don't think Olivia Coleman should have won an Oscar for this but then that's usually the case isn't it? Sometimes you can't understand why some people win and others lose. OC is a good actress (even though she's hard to look at on-screen) but she wasn't the main thing here - it was RW and ES's movie.I don't like RW. She doesn't have much range because she doesn't seem to act in anything but these types of movies-playing scheming baddies-however she did well with her role if only because she's had lots of experience playing these kinds of characters. I'm sure audiences might feel that she did a great job but to her she probably felt like she could do that role in her sleep just because that's what she always does so I'm not sure how much acclaim she should receive for playing the same character in yet another movie.I liked Emma Stone until I saw this movie-her quirkiness works well in some movies but it was out of place in this. That is just not how a person would act if they'd have been a servant in those times and no one would've been able to do the things that she did and get away with it so it's really hard to get into her acting because you are very aware the whole time that those things wouldn't be happening. Plus it really makes me sad that yet another actress who was naÃ¯ve and innocent at one point has fallen prey to the cesspool that is Hollywood. These actresses start out shunning nudity but through the constant pressure of Hollywood pushing depravity these actresses start to believe that taking their clothes off is 'necessary' to the scene and they become obsessed with making sure they go 'method' as they know that's a surefire way to get acclaim. Next thing you know they've convinced themselves it was their idea to do nude scenes-that's what happened here-ES was the one begging the director to let her do it. I just kind of lost a little respect for her because I thought that she was smarter than that and I didn't think that she was that desperate since she's already won an Oscar so I'm not really sure I understand what that was all about. It wasn't necessary.Nicholas Hoult has not impressed me in anything since About A Boy. He was not right for this and didn't do a good job.Joe Alwyn A.K.A. Taylor Swift's boyfriend-I like him but he added nothing to this. There was no heat between him and ES at the beginning like there should have been before she turned on him. He was forgettable.This movie was very slow and boring and I knew there was a reason I had hesitations when I would see it in my queue. This isn't the worst thing I've ever seen but I don't get the hype at all. What was up with that last scene?! Was it supposed to convey that ES realized she wasn't the favorite and was bereft because she got what she wanted but then realized she was still miserable? IDK. Also what was up with RW saying she was ready for a change right when the guards were coming to get her husband? It's almost like she knew that was gonna happen and suggested it just to make it seem like it was her idea and not decided for her. And what was the Queen thinking at the end? Was she gonna get rid of ES or keep her or what?Lastly - the music was so annoying. I just wanted to turn the volume off so I didn't have to keep hearing the same note. Plus I didn't get what the sounds were at the beginning and ending during credits. What was it suppose to be and what was the significance of having no music and just sounds we can't see and don't know what they are?Don't waste your time with this-it's ridiculous and I don't think anyone would refer to this movie as their 'Favourite'.,3,2,8,15 September 2019
Insidious," 'Tiptoe through the Tulips'?! Puh-lease!
",This was so stupid I was laughing at one point. Until about a little over halfway in I was thinking 'This isn't bad. It's not scary at all but it's kept me interested HOWEVER when's it gonna get terrifying?' Alas it didn't get scarier it got dumber. I don't know how these actors kept straight faces throughout this film. I would've been laughing so hard!Summary-family...weird stuff starts happening in house...oldest son becomes lost in the 'further'...mom calls in some lady who can see the spirits...Patrick Wilson has astral projection abilities too...yada yada yada...requisite demon with sharp claws and hooves...lots of running and spirits...things don't make sense...wait! What?! Ok more running...follow voice of wife...they make it back safe...but wait nope! Turns out Dad got possessed by an old lady spirit when he was in the 'further' who terrorized him when he was younger...he chokes out lady who can see the spirits...Patrick Wilson tells his wife 'I'm here' but all she sees is the old lady (who's really a man)...blah blah blah...credits...oh wait yep they included the requisite jump scare AFTER the credits roll...great! Now they'll be sequels galore...weee!!! Whew! For a minute there I thought we were in danger of somebody having an original thought BUT nope! Turns out we're still addicted to mediocrity. All is well in the world...AAAAnd...SCENE!,5,1,1,16 December 2018
Midsommar," What in the actual F?
",This was straight wack! Made ZERO sense. This is why I don't travel out of the US.,5,1,11,11 January 2020
The Witch," What am I missing?!
",Ok I don't get why everyone says this is terrifying. I was not scared one bit or even remotely scared until the end...when I knew the movie was getting close to being over and nothing scary had happened. Then I was like 'Oh please no don't let me have wasted all this time for nothing.' But alas I did waste my time for nothing.I have never seen a black goat like that. It was very pretty and almost human like. It doesn't seem like they treated any of the animals in this film humanely. I mean obviously they didn't kill them but having that goat pretend like he was gonna charge or when the kids were chasing it around etc...it just seems like those things would cause it distress.The little kids were cute and convincing but they don't seem to be acting anymore. Maybe after they made this film they were like 'If this is filmmaking then methinks I'll consider another line of work.'Anna Taylor-Joy has got something weird going on with her eyes that is distracting. She may or may not be a good actress but I don't know because all I can focus on when she's onscreen is her eyes and I find myself wondering how she keeps her eyeballs in their sockets because they are stretched at the corners to the point where it looks like her lashline is pulled away from her eyeball.The mom is really ugly and annoying. She only looks slightly better IRL and really the only terrifying thing about this movie is when you look her up on IMdB and see her yellow teeth. You're an actress and have got to have enough money to address that by now so why haven't you?!Why does Black Philip ask if she wants butter?! How bout 'How'd you like me to take this role off your CV and we can act like it never happened?' Or 'Could I fix your eyes? Or how'd you like a hot bath with something to eat and a nice clean dress to wear?' Instead he asks her if she'd like butter...um ok sure whatever. What does that even mean?!I hope that they used some type of body prosthetic for the witch because if that is someone's real body then that is gross.Are we expected to believe that this witch is gonna suck on that goat and it would just stand there and not be making noise?! That's unrealistic.And finally is the goal to fly when you become a witch? I mean living in the forest and being naked and covered in filth and being toothless doesn't sound like a good time. Aren't you supposed to want more than that. Oh yes please Satan I'll sign away my soul for that lifestyle...no thanks. I'll pass and figure out how to churn my own butter.Wish I would've watched something else.,3,2,4,30 September 2018
Jersey Boys," 'Walk like a man'...Away from this
","Meh. That's about all I can say. This had a lot of potential but it ended up being like a cross between a made for TV movie and a high school production. Maybe it was Clint Eastwood or maybe it was too much material to cover or maybe the leads just couldn't carry the movie. There were a lot of issues and in the end it looked really cobbled together and when it ended I wasn't invested in what happened to any of them. Maybe the movie could have been better had CE just picked one time period of Frankie's life instead of trying to fit all of it into one movie. The lead actor was too wooden and reserved to carry this. In a word he was boring. He was too short to the point of distraction and his butt chin and slightly crossed eyes just kept taking me out of the story line. He looked like a cross between Mario Lopez and Herve Villechaize. Plus they didn't do a very good job in the makeup department with him because he never aged. Even when he was supposed to be older he just looked like a high school production's idea of how to age someone. The Bob Gaudio actor was pretty good. He looked like a cross between Tate Donovan, Steve Buscemi & Chris Klein.It's sweet that Clint wants to put one of his 20 kids in his film which is good for Francesca Eastwood because she can't act. Even in this small ass throwaway forgettable role she managed to be unforgettably awful. Famous father does not a good actress make. She needs to go into another line of work. She'd be getting no roles if it wasn't for Daddy.Other than those highlights there's nothing here worth watching. 'Oh what a night'...this wasn't.",3,0,1,1 September 2018
The Conjuring," This was supposed to be scary right?
","I don't know what I am missing. I feel kind of alone as most of the reviewers are stating that this is very scary and terrifying. Maybe I have seen too many horror films but this kind of thing is not scary to me. In fact I was laughing out loud at some parts. The ending was so stupid. The mom experiences a possession so deeply that she almost dies and then at the end she's just standing with her husband on the porch like it was a Hallmark film. If you had just been through that you would be rushing to the hospital to get your wounds checked out. So unrealistic.I did like Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga but that's about it. Ron Livingston was so bland and boring in this. He must have been doing this for the paycheck only. He added nothing special and it could have been anyone in that role. There was no chemistry between him and Lili Taylor. In one scene they are in their bedroom after they first move in and she suggests they 'christen' the house. He actually looks like he's completely grossed out about having to kiss her.Maybe people feel this movie is scarier than it really is because it is supposedly based on real events. I did research on this when it came out because I was interested in the back story and it seems a lot of it was debunked. And of course if there was any truth to any of it this movie took a lot of liberties with the facts. Think about it...if you found yourself in their situation. If all those things were really happening why did they continue to live in the house for 10 YEARS?! I am sorry but there is just no way anyone would continue to live there if they were waking up with bruises or their children were so terrified they took to sleeping on the ground floor rather than in their own bedrooms. I know the filmmakers think they covered themselves by having the dad state that they had sunk every penny into the house and they had no where to go blah blah. Ok great but they could've explored other options. They could've pitched a tent in an open field somewhere and showered at the local Y. The children could've showered at their school gym. They could have appealed to family members or the community or something. So what if they defaulted on the loan! If their health and welfare was being affected to the degree that they were experiencing they could've found a way to not live there. It is utter rubbish to expect us to believe that a normal person would just continue to put up with that. I don't buy the whole 'it doesn't matter where you go' the spirits will still haunt you. Ok did anyone else report that happening? NOPE! They all wisely just got the hell out and that was the end of it.This honestly is no different than most horror films out there. They throw in the haunted house, ghosts and the requisite jump scares and they think they've got a winner. Supernatural stuff does not scare me because as long as I have lived I have never once experienced any of the things these horror films portray. BUT I will say if you want to see something truly terrifying just look to real life. I guarantee you the stuff that happens IRL is 10 times scarier than anything the writer's room in Hollywood could make up.If you want to be truly horrified take some time to search up the 1986 TV movie The Deliberate Stranger starring Mark Harmon as Ted Bundy. The fact that Ted Bundy confessed to killing 36 people but the authorities believe it to be closer to 100 is truly terrifying. The fact that this guy was married with a child and just out there walking around among us looking totally normal but killing at random is what keeps me up at night. That movie is the reason that after all these years I won't walk alone at night and I have a healthy distrust of people wearing casts asking for help. They haven't even found all the bodies of the people he killed. It is so hard to wrap my mind around the fact that we encounter these individuals on a daily basis without knowing it. That should scare you NOT some paranormal crap drivel.If you believe in spirits and ghosts then I suppose this might scare you but if you don't I wouldn't suggest watching this.",3,0,2,17 October 2018
Black Panther," Expected a lot more...so bland and meh
",I'd heard how great this was and about how much money it made so I was expecting a lot but this movie left me scratching my head. No one stood out in this. The kid from Get Out was terrible in this - it felt like he just got thrown in the movie because he was in Get Out and not because he was truly the right choice for the movie. It's almost like he was smirking throughout the film. Someone else would have been better in this. He was not good. Everyone kept saying how funny the sister was so I was expecting a real laugh riot-I laughed one time. This whole movie was very sedate - almost like you could fall asleep to it. Plus it felt like a lot of girl power - like I seriously thought that at one point the women were just gonna take over and run everything. And can I just say I think Forest Whitaker is overrated? I don't think he has much range and while everyone else seemed to do well with the accent - he sounded like he couldn't do it. I usually love Martin Freeman but he was so bland in this.I do not think this is deserving of all the accolades. Yes it has a mostly all black cast and that's great but that doesn't mean it equals brilliance or an amazing story. This was just ho hum. Disappointing.,5,2,3,23 September 2018
Identity," Once upon a time these people looked good
",This movie held my attention. That's all I will say for it because it was so convoluted that honestly who wants to expend that many brain cells trying to figure out something that you are partaking in specifically to NOT think. I just want to be entertained. I'm not trying to figure out a bunch of plot twists. What I will say is this - it's great to go back to see films of movie stars who are older now simply to see how time has ravaged their face. I would say everyone (even Jake Busey who on his best day is hard to look at) was at their prime in this film as far as looks go. Look any of them up now and most of them are straight busted. That's gotta be so hard to see yourself onscreen looking amazing and then looking in the mirror and seeing how old you've become. So glad I'm not in film.,8,1,3,23 August 2018
Annihilation," The people who greenlit this should be annihilated
",I gave this 5 stars only because I like Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac BUT I gotta say they both phoned it in and I expected better. I'm surprised they took these roles.The affair made no sense. If Natalie was supposed to be so in love with Oscar why did she sleep with that other guy?!Tessa Thompson...am I the only one who thinks she's overrated? She's in everything as of late but I'm like why though?! She's bland and boring.Gina Rodriguez was so extra in this. I like her but she overacted in this and it was silly.Jennifer Jason Leigh is past her expiration date and looks straight busted. She is so hard to look at. I never considered her a looker but wow! All those years of smoking have taken their toll. And what's with that angry mumbling act? She does it in every role. She's over as far as I'm concerned. She's just annoying now. No one is checking for her anymore. She needs to just quit. I doubt anyone would notice if she stopped acting. She brings nothing to her roles. She's very one note.This went on for way too long. It had potential and kept me engrossed but if I wanted to watch two hours of something going nowhere I'd stand in my garage and look at my parked car.And the ending? So I'm guessing NEITHER one of them came back. The glowy reptilian eyes? Amirite or nah?You know how when you add a certain movie to your watchlist on Netflix (like this one) and when you look for a movie to watch you keep passing over that one cause some kind of red flag is raised subconsciously? Yep there's a reason for that...listen to the warning signals and don't go into the 'shimmer'.,5,2,3,12 January 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," I mean...
","I waited forever to see this. I won't pay extra for movies. I have to wait until they become available on my subscription services of which I already pay a monthly fee. Finally this became available on HULU and I was so excited. Started watching it immediately. I was getting into it thinking it was gonna be so epic and then it turned into the unexpected which could have been ok BUT I didn't like the campiness of it. It had potential to be really scary if they could've found a way to keep it serious.Basically this movie is about the 'gods' ruling the world. They have to be appeased in order for the world to be saved. The way they accomplish this is...5 people ('whore'; 'jock'; 'scholar'; 'stoner/loser' and 'virgin') get lured somehow to a cabin in the woods where their every move is influenced by a control group underground below the cabin. These unsuspecting people come to their grisly end depending on what items they pick up/'choose' from the basement of the cabin. There is a corresponding monster to each item in the basement and there are endless horrors to pick from. All the monsters come from every horror film/legend/fairytale etc...you can imagine. Ghosts, werewolves, merman, zombies, dragons, people who set fires, killer clowns...and they are really hard to kill. The victims can't just be killed...the gods require lots of gore and suffering to be part of the kill or they won't be appeased. Oh and Sigourney Weaver shows up for 5 minutes at the end and is completely wooden the whole time. What was she thinking doing this?! Must've wanted to remodel her house and thought this would be an easy payday.A few things...how did they get to the cabin in the first place? I was thinking Chris Hemsworth must've been in on it but then he died so was there really a cousin? Did this organization somehow put it into their minds that they had to drive to a random cabin and CH just thought it was his cousin's? If so then essentially there would be no free will. The control room made it out that these people had free will but not really if they were pushed/heavily influenced to go to the cabin in the first place.Also something stuck out to me as really unrealistic. When the 'virgin' character is getting beat up on the dock by the large zombie-she should've died from her injuries the way he was throwing her into the posts etc...in fact she's crawling away from him and looks weak as heck BUT when the 'stoner' saves her she gets up and runs off and is able to fight off people until the end. Then she gets attacked by a werewolf and still manages to sit up and be ok. Look I can get into things as long as there's an element of being somewhat realistic BUT when things are that over the top I just can't with that.This isn't the worst but I have to say I was pretty disappointed at the end. If you go into this thinking it's gonna be your typical horror film you will be thrown for a loop. This isn't scary. It's dark humor and really goes off the rails towards the end.",7,0,3,6 February 2020
