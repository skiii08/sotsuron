Minority Report," nice, but flat
",this movie is a typical steven spielberg movie. first the story seems to be very exciting but then it slows down to a 'very nice' story and the end is to be foretelled. only tom cruise is pulling this movie out of the ordinary by playing one of his best roles ever. i don´t want to spoil anything so i won´t say anything about the plot.,8,0,0,2 November 2002
Scary Movie 2," awful
",this movie is awful even if you know scary movie 1. the plot is a mix of dracula and poltergeist. but the writer of the script only wrotes sceens with some sort of disgusting fart and barf humour. this movie is a chain of people making disgusting things like budging in a cake with some crippled and slimy hand. this humor is childish.dont even spend a penny on this movie.,2,1,1,23 March 2002
The Bourne Identity," a good 8
",this movie is great popcorn movie without a deep storyline. some great action sequences and a 'surprise' ending. franka potente is doing great in her first action packed us-movie. i only wonder why all great car chases were filmed in paris ?,8,0,1,1 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," not quiet the book
","well, first of all this movie is not quiet as the book and imho not a movie for children and after all just a popcorn movie. the plot has been sacreficed for action and effects. the author of the script was falling the mission. pitty.6/10",6,0,0,26 November 2002
Ice Age," a real cool movie
",youÂ´ve seen the pixar movies and loved them ? well you would love this one.4 animals all different species tried to bring back a human baby to its 'herd' and stomping from one adventure into another. until now i only saw the dubbed german version but even this one is very nice to see and even listen.all in all this movie is an good movie even if its not an disney movie.,10,2,4,17 March 2002
