Spartacus," Quite possibly the best of the sword and sandals epics but doesn't feel like Kubrick.
","Stanley Kubrick's films from as early as 'The Killing' to the last, the near miss that was 'Eyes Wide Shut' all demands that the audience keep their focus on the screen through every scene, through every shot, through every frame of film. This film however feels pedestrian in certain scenes as if directed by an ordinary Joe not the great Kubrick. Apparently Kubrick came in after production had started, even so the majority of the film was his.Two moments that stands out as being Kubrick's happened during the gladiator combat. One when the gladiators were fighting and our focus is on Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Grabus (John Dall). The other is when Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) tries to see gladiators fight each other as he wait his own turn. Some of the battle scenes and scenes of slaves marching toward freedom look nothing special. But the pivotal battle sequence was outstanding. However some of the more quieter moments is nothing special, such as when Antonius (Tony Curtis) performs a magic trick or moments with Spartacus and Varinia (Jean Simmons). They could easily be from any other movie. The main story of course is a slave revolt is started by the slave/gladiator Spartacus. The gladiators free themselves and free other slaves and attempt a mass exodus out of Italy is planned. In Rome however the politicians debate the crisis while jockeying for position of power. Key among the Romans are Crassus who represents the Patrician (who believes that the right to rule is a birthright) and Gracchus (Charles Laughton) who represents the Republicans (who believes in democracy). This is probably the first and only time in the History of Hollywood that the word 'Republican' ever represent something that might be good. Ironic that it was written by Dalton Trumbo a victim of blacklisting. Anyway forget about that, the whole Roman subtext is about how politicians exploit a crisis to gain power.Although this is an epic and the characters are suppose to be larger than life I thought there were very good human moments. Among my favorites are the father-son like relationship between Spartacus and Antonius especially in the end. Some of the moments among the gladiators while they were in the school, when Betiatus (Peter Ustinov) offers to take Gracchus with him as he is about leave Rome. even the controversial snail and oysters scene was very well done.The performances were good especially Olivier, and Laughton, although I think Peter Ustinov gave the best performance although it did feel like it was comic relief. On the whole I thought was very good but is not prime Kubrick.",8,3,6,7 October 2007
Fight Club," Seriously, 8.7 from IMDb voters?
","I can not understand what the fascination with this film is. All I get from this film is a bunch of guys who starts out beating each other up and then rebelling against society. And it's started by a yuppie, no less. Do they feel trapped by the conventions of society? Do they feel emasculated? If so why don't they just go to one of those caveman retreats where you dance around naked and doing primal screams, so you can connect with your ancestors and your inner caveman and spare society from your destructive urges.I have heard and read some people saying this is the greatest film they have ever seen. It makes me wonder who they identify with, is it The Narrator the guy who feels impotent by society or Tyler Durden the rebel leader who has taken a path against social convention. Personally I think both characters are among the most worthless characters I have ever seen in the Movies. Neither have any really redeeming quality. Both on the extreme side. One meek and almost helpless while the other is brash and fearless. Even when we find out the truth about the characters it really doesn't help the situation.This is a well crafted film, it looks good, crisp direction, well acted. Edward Nortons needs to be called what he is, the best actor of his generation, even better than Sean Penn in my opinion. He does a fantastic job playing the meek office drone. Even in his narration we hear a guy who seems to have little passion for his own life. Brad Pitt is very good too playing Tyler Durden. The guy is the opposite of The Narrator. He has passion but for what? to harm society? This movie has been described as subversive, a call out against societal convention. But to what? To chaos and destruction against society? Is that really much more preferable? Well like I said previously go to those caveman weekend, strip naked, yell out your primal scream and don't come back because society is better off without you.",2,1,7,4 March 2008
Oldboy," As good and disturbing as expected.
","I read the review for 'Oldboy' a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.The basic story is that a man named Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years and then released. He has no idea who or why this is being done to him. While in captivity he readies himself for the day when he gets out and take revenge on those who imprisoned him, and to find out why he was imprisoned. So far it sounds just like any old revenge martial art flick and up to this point it pretty much is, but it's incredibly well crafted. I have to admit I have not paid much attention to Asian martial arts films since Bruce Lee died and maybe I should now. Mainly because this movie doesn't have the jumpy camera work, or bad editing of those old flicks. This movie is a crisply shot as any Scorcese film. That alone elevates this movie to a higher plateau.Once he is released, Oh Dae-Su goes on a quest to find what happened to his family and to find the identity of those who had him captured. During the quest for the bad guys, the movie played out like an old fashioned detective movie. The search wasn't rushed and neither was it boring. I suppose the set up made us want to go on this quest with Oh Dae-Su which sounds like Odysseus, and just as Odysseus went on one incredible quest so did Oh Dae-Su.It's when he finds the man who had him held captive that the movie truly departs from being an average revenge film to something that is extra ordinary and extraordinarily disturbing. It's at this point that I have to say that the less said the better. It's something totally out of the ordinary and something that I think will repulse some viewers, but at the same time one can't help have sympathy for all the characters even the man who ordered Oh's incarceration. The acting in the movie is excellent. I had no idea that Korean cinema has such skillful actors. They all really played their part incredibly well. Min-sik Choi, who played Oh Dae-Su was incredible. He goes through the rigors of being a desperate captive, to being a determined man on a mission. Along the way he runs through the gamut of so much emotion and not once did he hit a false note. Overall I have to say that this movie is incredibly well crafted and as good as everybody say, however I find it a little disturbing so I can't give this movie a ten. But don't let my not giving the film a ten scare you away it's a good, enjoyable film.",8,17,27,3 February 2009
The Prestige," The big revelation is a big let down
","'The Prestige' is a very well crafted movie. The camera work, the lighting, the set decoration, the costumes and the acting for the most part are very well done. The way it flashback and flash forward yet maintains its cohesiveness and and build suspense is a testimony to Christopher Nolan as a film director and to his editor. Despite all this the big surprise the audience is hoping for is pretty much revealed to anyone closely paying attention with about 50 minutes left in the movie.The film is about a couple of magicians who were co-apprentices when they were young, until a tragedy set off a bitter rivalry. The rivalry reach a climax as they try to out do each other with a trick called the teleported man. The quest for the answer sets the audience for a promise of big surprises yet in the end what we get is something so obvious and yet another one that is so far fetched that it stretches one's suspension of disbelief.To me the only surprise is what happened to the Hugh Jackman character in the end. It's what happened to him in the beginning that created the bitterness among the two friends. And the Christian Bale character was in no way at all likable. But I suppose it's appropriate because it's when we realize that the movie is no longer about the revenge but about the egos of the magicians/showman. They are not just trying to awe their audience but also to one up each other. They want to come up with one trick that will make their fellow magicians envious.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale gave very good performances, Michael Caine is wonderful as always playing an older magician who guides Jackman. Scarlett Johannson did a decent job although her English accent seem to change, very early on it was as cockney as Mr. Caine's but later on it sounded more upper class. David Bowie was a bit of a surprise as real life scientist Nikola Tesla. I didn't recognize him at first.Over all I would say that as a period piece and a character study of magicians it was well done but it's main failing is the big promise and the big revelations of the teleported man, one was obvious and the other was ridiculous.",6,1,3,24 February 2008
The Last Legion," A bad mix of History and legend
","'The Last Legion' tries to tie in the last Caesar with the legend of King Arthur. The legend of King Arthur has been for a longtime been linked to the Romans. The latest linking is that Arthur was a Roman soldier who commanded Sarmatian cavalry men in Britain against barbarians. Anyway 'The Last Legion' mix in historical characters with mythology. Very rarely is a movie very accurate in telling historical events, mixing in legends you know that historical facts are out the window.The movie begins with the naming of a young boy as the new Caesar, Romulus Augustus. Soon Barbarians invade Rome, kills the boy's parents and capture him. Of course there's treachery involved, I mean what's a Roman story without a good backstabbing? However there are a few soldier who will support the new Emperor no matter what. And they set out to rescue him and take him away from the clutches of the evil barbarians, hoping they could take him to the 9th legion or 'the last legion' in Britannia. The movie's premise no matter how ridiculous, has the making of a good action adventure fantasy, but out right the movie misses out on that. First off a good fantasy film must have a good dream like quality in the cinematography and the lighting. This movie is too bright, specially in the outdoor scenes. It has none of that dusky look that makes fantasy films look more like a dream. The action is pretty decent but the ones with the female warrior just seems too choreographed. The sets have that crumbling look as befits the waning days of the Western Roman Empire.The acting was not all that bad Ben Kingsley did a decent job as the Ambrosinus, he plays it with enough playfulness as a role in a movie like this requires. Kevin Mckidd makes a decent villain although I wish his performance was a little more over the top because the role required. The big surprise for me is Colin Firth, long have I dismissed him just like American producers have as the bland good looking guy in the movies who rarely if ever gets the girl. Here he's very good as the commander, he shows a quiet strong and authoritative presence plus he gets the girl, Aishwarya Rai. I don't know how her part got in the movie? She's just not the least bit believable as a female warrior, she doesn't have that ferocity that Lucy Lawless as 'Xena the Warrior Princess' had. And as for her being the most beautiful woman in the world, I'll take Diane Kruger anytime.The screenplay really doesn't explain too much to us, particularly the reason the commander and his soldiers remained royal to the young emperor. Neither did it explain why the boy became the new Caesar. Historically the boy's father completed a successful coup d'etat and made him a figurehead while dear old dad became the power behind the throne. The movie doesn't even give us a line lamenting the end of the Western empire.The movie just fail on so many level and I put the blame squarely on the the director, producers and the writer. What they made is an action adventure pretty much like the ones from the 60s starring Steve Reeves",4,1,6,1 March 2009
No Country for Old Men," Compared to 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo', a major disappointment.
","The first Coen brothers movie I ever saw was 'Blood Simple', I thought it was one of the best movie of that year and one of the finest crime drama I ever saw. When I saw 'Fargo I thought it was brilliant, it was clever and entertaining. Comparing it to 'The English Patient', which beat it for best picture Oscar, I thought that the Coen Brothers were robbed. Now with all the praise being heaped at 'No Country For Old Men', I was expecting a lot. Unfortunately what I saw was a film that pales in comparison to the previous two films. I have not seen any of the competition but if this IS the best film I have to say what a disappointing year.My main problem with this movie is that it moved too slow. A lot of times a scene lingers before the payoff. We see the character of Chigurh prolonging a scene before the inevitable and since we know he's a ruthless killer we know what he's going to do. It also take a long time before the main plot line gets rolling or at least it felt like a long time. Some of the scenes with Tommy Lee Jones as the sheriff also just feels so painfully slow. Making Tommy Lee Jones seem boring takes a lot of shall we say wrongly applied effort. The main plot line of the movie involves found money, a drug deal gone wrong, a ruthless assassin. and the cops trying to solve things. I don't need to say anything else about the plot because it's pretty easy to figure out. We know what Chigurh was after but we don't know how he got involved in the first place did he set the drug dealers up? There are numerous plot holes that opens up a lot question but does not answer them.I don't know why the Coen brothers set the movie in 1980, I suppose that's when it was set in the novel but it certainly has a faded look to it and at times even painful on the eyes. The movie has virtually no music. I have said that in my comments on 'Cache' and 'Abre los Ojos', that the lack of music in thrillers is refreshing. However in this movie the lack of music is deafening. It doesn't work this time.The acting is very good. Javier Bardem, who plays Chigur, is very scary. He plays it like a human terminator. Very emotionless, he doesn't flinch, he doesn't blink, and he doesn't take no for an answer. Although I have said that Tommy Lee Jones was dull at times I have to say that he was good at playing his character. Josh Brolin who was at the center of the action finally is beginning to convince me that he has a future in the big screen something that eluded his dad.Overall It's a movie with a plot that's easy to comprehend, but just plods along in certain areas and have many situation that was unanswered.",4,2,5,15 January 2009
Jerry Maguire," Good script, good acting equals good film.
","'Jerry Maguire' has to rate as one of the most quotable movies of the last decade and a half. It's given us the lines 'Show me the money', 'Help me, Help you', 'You had me at hello' and 'You complete me'. And it's that last line, that really describe this movie. It's really about the growth of an individual. We see Jerry Maguire the character, grow from just an agent to becoming much more, it's not an easy trip but for the most part it's an entertaining one. Jerry Maguire is a top sport agent. He has a decent amount of big names as client and he's engage to a beautiful woman. Then one day while visiting one of his client in the hospital, the client's young son confronted him after he gives the client a shallow encouragement. The confrontation stick in his mind and would even get him to write a 'mission statement' for the company. The 'mission statement' basically lays out a plan that the agents give their clients more personal attention. Unfortunately his boss doesn't like it. The movie gives us a look at the world of the sports agents. Who are they that gets a cut of an athlete's earning and do they really deserve it? In the beginning they're just there to negotiate the numbers and get the athletes as much exposure. In the end, Jerry has become more than a guy who makes deal for an athlete. It also gives us a look at some clients they're more demanding than the agents are prepared to handle. But if handled right they will prove to be worth the trouble.Jerry Maguire is played by Tom Cruise, and he gives one of his best performance. I think it's every bit the equal of Cuba Gooding Jr's. Oscar winning performance. Both men were on top of their game playing off each other. It's sad that his erratic behavior of late has caused harmed to his career because Tom Cruise is a very good actor. So too is Mr. Gooding and Renee Zellwegger, who plays an office worker in Tom Cruise's office and who joined him as he tries to put forth his 'mission statement' into practice. All in all, I think it's a good movie with a very observant script, complimented by great acting.",7,25,34,15 February 2009
Raging Bull," One of the Greatest ever
","There's a saying that a bad movie never feel short enough and that a great movie never feel long enough. This movie is great and even at 2 hours and 9 minutes it never felt slow. It is about one time middle weight champion Jake LaMotta it is a biography and a character study. We see a man that is a product of his environment, his outlet for what this environment has created and his eventual downfall, possibly because he never truly escaped his environment, and finally, eventual self realization.What we see in this movie is that Jake LaMotta is indeed a product of his environment. He came from a volatile environment one where violence is common. A lot of his problem is faced and handled through violence whether it be dealing with his wives or his brother. From what we know now it is safe to assume he and his equally volatile brother learn this behavior from their father. Jake has an outlet for all this rage, boxing. He's a ferocious fighter who would willingly kill an opponent if given the opportunity. One fighter was treated ferociously because Jake's wife commented on him being good looking. As for the way he treats his wife, Jake treats her as the classic Alpha Male to the extreme. He is possessive and jealous, paranoid to the extent that he always has to know why she talked to certain men and who they were.Jake's environment is also filled with 'wiseguys' and he tries to distance himself from them, but his brother joey is friendly with them. As a matter of fact so was his wife, Vickie. We would see that even though in his boxing career he tried to stay away from the mob he could not completely and it almost prevented his chance at a championship. In the end even though he never became a 'wiseguy' he acted like one and it would bring about his downfall.Martin Scorcese's direction is crisp and brilliant. He knows when to move the camera to make the film look like it had tremendous kinetic energy and he knows when to just allow the camera to stand still and let the actors act and the story unfold. The script, particularly in the case of Jake, does not divert to other things. Every word spoken by Jake tells you about Jake. And every word spoken by Jake is that of a man who is volatile, unpolished, domineering person, who believes he must have things his way.The acting is superb, Robert DeNiro as Jake is brilliant. We see the volatility. When he paces while angered he seem to be a caged untamed animal looking both to escape and to pounce on whoever is foolish enough to get near him. Joe Pesci is great too. Long has he been seen as just a minor player in the Deniro/Scorcese movies but in truth he is as important a member as the other two. This was Cathy Moriarty's first film and she too was brilliant it is very surprising when you consider that she was twenty at the time.Overall this film truly deserve all the accolades that it has received. It is a great film, brilliantly directed and acted, that shows how his environment shapes a man and how it affects his life and people around him.",10,2,4,25 October 2007
300," Visually stunning and entertaining sword and sandal epic. Just don't expect the History Channel
","The sword and sandal genre has been around since the beginning of the motion picture. And why not you have incredible sources like the Bible, Mythology and, as in the case of '300', ancient History. The movie 300 is based on a historical event that took place in 480 B.C.E. when the mighty Persian empire was invading Greece and 300 Spartans fought them at the pass at Thermophylae. It's one of the greatest historical battles that should be told and had been before in 1961's 'The 300 Spartans'. That movie, which was made at the height of Hollywood's sword and sandal epics, benefited from the film technology of the era. It was shot in Technicolor and in Cinemascope, 300 benefits from CGI. No matter what the technology a film still depends on a good script.I have to say outright that 300 is one of the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen. This is the kind of film I envisioned when I was reading about Greek Mythology in High school. To see a real historical event gets this treatment is something beyond my expectation. From the very first shot you know this is something you have never seen before and it just maintain this level throughout. It's like every frame was drawn by Boris Vallejo, it's a unique visual feast.The main problem with this movie is the script. We never got a good background to the conflict between the Greeks and the Persians. We know the Persians wants to rule over the Spartans but why? We don't see the Spartans cooperating with the other Greek city states except when a token force from Athens show up to fight by their side. Hollywood movie treatment of historical events, unfortunately are incomplete and highly inaccurate and 300 is no exception once you get down to the bare bones of the script.The other thing about the script is that it was written as to be recited not spoken. And the actors perform it as such. The dialog and the acting is stilted just as was the case with many of the sword and sandal epics from the 1950s and 60s. Gerard Butler's performance as King Leonidas was as expected, he gives one of those larger than life performance that Charlton Heston specialized in back in his epic days. The rest of the cast pretty much followed along the same line. The one exception was Lena Heady, who played Leonidas' wife. She gave her role a little more humanity than the others, but she really didn't have enough screen time to flesh the character out more.All in all I would have to say that this movie is an entertaining and incredible visual feast but at the same time it's just another sword and sandal epic with a lot of short coming when it comes to background information and your typical stilted dialog and performance.",7,0,0,1 February 2009
Semi-Pro," Semi-entertaining
","'Semi-Pro' is the story of a team in the old ABA. The ABA was a basketball league formed in the 60s to be a competition for the NBA. The league existed from 1967 to 1976 until they could no longer exist and they had to merge with the NBA. Now we have a movie not about the league or its history but about a movie about a team in the waning days of the league. But basically it's just a sport movie and not even a very good one.Outright the movie tries to elicit laughter by having the team we're supposed to follow be called the 'Tropics' from cold northern Flint, Michigan. The team is owned and coach by one of the players Jackie Moon (Wil Ferrell). The 'Tropics' are a miserable team and Jackie is a miserable coach. He would stop play in the middle of the game to chastise a fan for bringing his own food into the stadium. What he is is a great promoter or better yet a great self- promoter. He opens the game singing his one hit song. He's also a deluded guy who thinks that he can take his team to the NBA when the two leagues merge. The movie really doesn't even try to be a real sport movie instead it tend to be a showcase for Jackie Moon's idiocy. In other words it show case Wil Ferrell doing idiotic stuff and call it comedy. When the teams are told that they are going to need to increase their attendance in order to be considered for the merger. Jackie comes up with all kind of crazy things including wrestling a bear for halftime entertainment. It's like in some other Wil Ferrell films, the film stop the regular narrative and watch him do things that are supposed to be funny. I'm going to say it, HE ISN'T. He's just like all the other Saturday Night Live actors, they're not very good actors and I find most of their presence in movies a bit of a mockery.The one good thing about this movie is the Woody Harrelson character. He's an old pro who has been to the NBA and actually have a championship ring. Not only does he teach the team how to play the game properly and actually start winning, he has a decent romance with his ex-wife (Maura Tierney). but then this part of the movie has that done that been there feeling. But it's still better than the rest of the movie.Personally I think the ABA deserves a better treatment than what it got from this film. In some ways it revolutionized Pro Basketball. They came up with the 3 point shot, they allowed the freewheeling streetball style offense, (back in the day an NBA player showboating is going to get chastised by the coach, the ABA just let it go). If women's baseball can get 'A League of Their Own' why does the ABA have to be stuck with this?",4,1,2,11 February 2009
