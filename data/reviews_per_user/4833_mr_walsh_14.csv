Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good and Bad
","The underlying plot had potential.  But the story seemed to fold itself around special effects more than a great drama.  For instance, the entire pod race sequence really seemed to have no bearing on the story.Personally, I much more enjoyed the 'primitive' model-based space battles from Episode IV to the revolutionary digital creatures.  The space battle at the end of Episode I seemed tacked on and had none of the excitement of the originals.The saddest thing of all to me was how even Star Wars has been infected with political correctness.  Virtually no one dies, except the machines.  Heck, even Ewoks died in RoTJ.  I've heard this was to target a younger audience. Well, the first 3 Star Wars movies weren't watered down for kids.  Could they have been any more successful?To me it's a crime that  the greatest movie ever made was sacrificed as a vehicle for special effects and toys.",Null,0,1,6 April 2000
Unbreakable," Thoroughly Entertaining
","Of course many will compare this to '6th Sense', and there is indeed more than one similarity.  If you liked one you're sure to love the other.  I actually prefer 'Unbreakable' because the greatness spread across the entire movie, not concentrated on the ending as in '6th Sense'.  Excellently written by which the fantasy and wonder of comics became believable plot elements in a brilliant way.  Great acting all around, and wonderfully filmed.A Bruce Willis note:  I like Bruce Willis.  Ever notice his best roles ('6th Sense', '12 Monkeys', even 'Die Hard') feature him as a misunderstood outcast.  I understand in Hollywood he's a bit on the outside especially due to his rare republican beliefs.  Could he be drawing on this rejection by his peers?",9,0,0,26 November 2000
Chicken Run," Coo!
","Clever writing, which makes it as fun for adults as kids.  Lots of subtle things, making it a great video to watch over and over again.  And what a joy to see masters at the prime of their craft!I also like most how un-hollywood the movie was.  Unlike the 'Bean' movie, it clearly represented the vision of its British creators, uncorrupted by American marketing directors (I'm not British; I'm an American). Otherwise, we'd have little 'kid' chickens that know more than the adults chickens, and a big tall awkward loser chicken named 'Jar Jar'.",8,0,0,9 July 2000
Juno," Decent acting, but over-hyped
","I enjoyed the performances by all the actors. 'Bleeker' in particular came across as completely authentic. The dialog had its moments, though I didn't understand how a teenager would know about such ancient obscure things like 'Soupy Sales'.But like 'Lars and the Real Girl' I felt like the movie felt incomplete somehow. Almost in the same vein as 'Dazed and Confused', except that it *unintentionally* was a fairly unexciting recount of a few days in the lives of a few people as they deal with a fairly novel situation.And I have to say that I can't really enjoy a movie that glorifies people like Juno and 30+ year old teenagers like Mark but belittles responsible 'grown ups' like Vanessa and the abortion protester. I guess movies like this appeal to a society that would like there to be no shame for anything.",4,3,11,6 July 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Entertaining but Shallow
","Appropriately, many large trucks haul the terminators and co through this movie.  I say 'appropriately', because this movie contains an inordinate amount of holes which such vehicles could drive through.Clearly, Cameron had sewn his movie shut with no intention of a sequel.  We all remember him saying 'T3 without me!' some years back.  Like Alien3, the allure of $$ drove the writers to open up what the creator wanted shut. Most people couldn't care less about this sort of thing, but to me it makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief.T3 lacks continuity from the characters of its predecessors.  This John Connor to me just doesn't fit - he's wimpy, seems to have forgotten what he did in T2, and doesn't have the hard edge he had in T2.  The absence of Linda Hamilton, or perhaps any strong human character, diminishes the entire human/robot dynamic.And while the humor in prior T* movies stemmed from plausible situations that a terminator would run into, you can see right through each of the staged jokes in T3.  You find yourself laughing, but it feels like 'Airplane' humor.But in spite of all this, T3 certainly gave me a couple hours of entertainment.  I can't get enough of robots destroying things, quite honestly.  Yes, as an engineer I cringe each time I see how easily the movie sidesteps such issues as the weight of a Terminator, the need for amazing amounts of friction between their feet and the ground, and how a clearly visible metallic backpack buckle somehow ignores magnetic forces.So, while I clearly enjoyed the entertaining action and eyecandy, I missed the depth of the T* films which transcended a cheap action movie.",7,0,0,19 July 2003
American Beauty," What? Did I see the same movie?
","I just can't understand the rave reviews so many people have given. Spacey's acting I liked.  The self-made kid drug dealer character had depth. But this movie seemed to me a movie that should have been an airplane-like absurd comedy except for its dose of exaggerated reality formed from the worst america has to offer.  As a result, somehow this movie becomes 'fine cinema', and according to the academy, the best artistic creation of the year.  Please.Yeah, there was symbolic imagery.  But geez it was all over the place, obvious and shallow.  Oh boy, there's a vase with roses.  Hey, her dress has a rose print to it.  Didn't she prune rose bushes?  Oh my gosh, the front door is red.  They might've well subtitled these scenes in flashing letters saying 'imagery relating to roses ahoy, which could mean passion and love'.To me, a great movie brings out the best in us and/or makes us think. This movie celebrates the destruction of the family and glamorizes kids that sell drugs.",3,1,1,9 July 2000
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Complete Trash
","I walked out of this movie wishing I had my 2 hours back. The movie started out so-so and got steadily worse. This kind of shock-value, low-grade humor makes Airplane II look like Shakespeare. How Roger Ebert could give this a 'B' is beyond me. The only thing more disturbing is knowing that they will have to try and top this with yet more shock value and wondering what else they could pile on - this movie has poop, every English vulgar word, full frontal male and female nudity and graphic depictions of decimated people. Awful.I have to wonder about the people that made this film. Could you really go to the premier of this thing, smiling and proud you were a part of this? What were you thinking Jenna Fischer?!? Who would let their kids act in this thing and say such vulgarity? I'd be ashamed to have my name in the credits on this one. I'm ashamed just to admit I went to this movie.",1,16,37,23 December 2007
Meet the Fockers," Sort of Funny
","This is one of those movies where you know there's been a joke and you're supposed to laugh, but you kind of have to make yourself do so. There are a couple of surprises but most of the gags can be seen a mile away unless you force yourself not to look. I think the performances were all pretty good but the writing just didn't deliver. Maybe it'd be funnier if I wasn't conservative, because the moral of the story is that conservatives, even national heroes like DeNeiro, are intolerant jerks that ruin the world for everyone else.Anyway, unless you have a lot of free time for somewhat funny fluff with lots of poop jokes and exploitation of babies who have been taught to swear, watch something worthwhile instead.",6,4,10,27 December 2004
Cars," Stunning visuals, terrific story
","Pixar has taken lighting, simulation and rendering to a new level. The neon, the chrome, the sunlight, the nighttime highway - the realism is amazing and stunning. The cars somehow look anthropomorphic AND realistic. You really wonder how they can ever trump this. Then again, there is the translucent bleu cheese in the the Ratetoui trailer...I sure wish there were more movies like this...it's clean, funny, engaging, universally appealing and a spectacle all at the same time. I find myself skipping 99% of the junk that comes out anymore. It's no wonder than just about all the Pixar movies are on the top100 list on IMDb.",9,4,5,5 June 2006
Jerry Maguire," Great, but so close to being classic
","(Spoilers ahoy!) This movie spoke to me as someone entangled in a competitive and cold profession who through only partly his own will finds himself placed right in the face of becoming a human being.Cuba Gooding Jr. steals the show - wonderfully acted.  Zellweger too gave us an outstanding and compelling character.  Cruise too did well but I found one critical flaw.  After Jerry marries Dorothy, we immediately can tell the intimacy isn't there - this Cruise played so well I noticed it before it's really emphasized by the viewing of the wedding video.  But at the end, when he decides he does love Dorothy he doesn't make the switch to truly loving her.  There's just such a mismatch between Zelweger's convincing devotion and Cruise's almost forced plea for her.  In fact, looking back at his scenes with Preston (ex-fiancee) show more electricity.Stylistically, this film has great, swift pacing.  Only thing I noticed: there's just too much music.  It almost becomes a cliche having the scene start with an apropos 70's tune commence shortly afterward.  Personally I like when the actors set the audience's reaction without the music - ala Kubrick.Apart from these minor things, this is a must-see.",8,6,12,7 February 2001
The Fountain," Unsatisfying
","I have to give the makers of this film credit for creativity and visuals. But the movie comes across to me as lacking in the human element. Maybe that's why it's so lauded by internet-ish folks on IMDb.Many have commended the acting, and I suppose it was well acted, but if I don't care about the characters, how can I care about the acting? For example, the quality of the dialog simply didn't reflect the intended intensity of relationship between husband and wife. The emotions are instead expressed with elements including several too many outbursts of anguish by Jackman/Tom. I mean, while it is clear that Tom is upset about Izzi's condition, you don't sense that he actually knows her as a person.As to story...I still really couldn't for the life of me explain the point. I won't give away the ending, but how can one reconcile the buildup and the conclusion? What are we supposed to take away from it other by being dazzled by cosmic spectacle and some vague connections? In the commentary, Aronofsky stated that he writes by taking a pile of interesting ideas and trying to find a way to meld them together. And that's what you get in this movie. Lots of good ideas, but not one cohesive, complete, satisfying story.",5,1,4,6 July 2007
Trainspotting," Outrageous, but that's about it
","This movie had many moments that shocked me, some funny moments and had convincing actors.  I have to disagree with the other reviewers in that I don't see the brilliance here.  Sure, I liked the 'toilet scene' but there's something missing needed to make this a great movie in my book.",5,4,17,12 January 2001
Amélie," Very innovative, but ending somewhat tarnished it.
","(Spoilers, kind of)I may seem overly conservative, but while I really enjoyed this movie, the ending left a bad taste in my mouth.  Here, we have this delightful, playful main character of Amelie.  But at the very end, her love is expressed by immediately jumping in bed with the person she's been pursuing, with a big smile on her face.  That to me seemed out of character for her.  I mean, this seems to happen more and more in movies anymore.  A movie which could have been a great PG / family movie gets bumped into the adult category because of a small amount of sex / language / nudity that adds nothing to the movie.",7,0,1,16 January 2004
Gladiator," Not terrible.
","(implied spoilers ahoy if you haven't seen it!)Good acting, but mismatched.  Phoenix's (Caesar's heir) didn't compare to Russell Crowe (Maximus).Characters a bit weak.  What's Maximus' feelings?  Is he unwilling to fight anymore?  Why does he fight so hard when he has nothing to live for?  Does he care or not?  How could Caesar not anticipate his son's rage at being passed over?  And if the sister was so cunning how is it she didn't find a way to assainate her brother who paraded around defenseless in front of her every day for 5 years?  Or that she would allow her secret plans to be heard by her son?  How could a former gladiator slave then go on to enslave more gladiators yet have a self-sacrificing loyalty?The cinematics were a cut above most movies but a cut below Scott's. There were too many different filming styles; in the beginning we have the slow motion blurred battle scenes (yuck).  Then CGI-peppered panorama shots (sorry, those CGI falling rose petals, birds and people still don't look quite right).  Then (my favorite, the most Ridley-like) lush dream sequences with wind swept European countryside.  Compare that to how much more coherent a vision we saw in Blade Runner, and those guys had to make little plastic models and matte paintings.Worth seeing, and the Roman trivia scattered in the skit was neat, but we're not talking Blade Runner or Alien quality stuff.",6,0,0,9 July 2000
