E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Probably one of the best 10 movies ever
","I went to see this movie in the theater about 20 years ago, and I found it magic. I think is the best Spielberg movie (with The Schindler's List) and one of the best 10 movies ever made. You cannot help to feel in both Elliot and ET's shoes, being connected to them like they are connected to each other. And it's probably the best movie for children ever made, now they make a lot of violent and superficial films for children and ET is a real classic that everyone should see at least once. It talks about friendship and tolerance, I give it 10 out of 10.",Null,2,4,29 September 2003
The English Patient," One of the best movies ever
","I think this is one of the best movies ever and should be in the top 250 ranking. It is a great drama and romantic movie, probably the best of the nineties. The cast is great, and the oscar won by Juliette Binoche was one of the most deserved that year.",Null,1,3,29 September 2003
