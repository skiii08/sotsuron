Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better luck next Time, George
","I am just coming from the swiss premiere, and I am really disappointed. I already guessed that TPM wont reach Return of the Jedi, not to speak of New Hope or Empire strikes back.Why made George Lucas a Disney-Movie? Disney makes 'em better! He once said, that he has to reach the generation which did not grow up with the trilogy. What a **** excuse. Most of this generation already saw the trilogy. The only generation who did not grow up with Star Wars was the one in the time of the New Hope. And they loved the real Star Wars. I won't say anything about Jar Jar, he disqualifies himself.There are two other thing that really made me angry:1. The Pod Race. It isn't thrilling, it isn't cool, nothing. It is much more fun to play it on the PC. The whole scene is much too long and the cuts are not fast enough. You don't feel anything when you see this one.2. Darth Maul: ok, I knew that he wouldn't reach Darth Vader. Nobody could do that. But pleeeease George: Make him more evil next time. Darth Maul wasn't but a better Federation Robot. I am not the one who argues about developping caracters and so on, New Hope worked well without it as well, but a Lord of the Sith should be really evil, and not only a good fighter.There were may other things making me really angry, but lets not forget the good things of this movie:1. Special Effects: Tremendous, the Visual Effects as well as the accustic. 2. Dart Sidious, although most of him was already shown in the teaser. 3. And what's most important: It's a Star Wars Movie. It's just as Brosnan-Bonds: Although they ain't any good, you have to see them.But please, George: Don't try to take the Disney-Road, we love you for the Trilogy and not for Jar Jar, Computer Games and Merchandizing Stuff.After all, I hope, Mel Brooks makes a Sequel to Spaceballs, someone has to comment TPM.",2,0,1,26 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," not as good as empire, but best to do
","a) i'm a big star wars fan, so I didn't have a lot of expectations after PM. but AotC really is good. Of course, empire, NH were definitly better, and I guess, I'll even like RotJ more (I gotta go watch this one some more times to judge on this). But its really a very cool filmb) yoda kicks ass.c) of course, anakin is still not as great as vader. but christiensen really does a good job. vader didn't have to do mimics at all, and there was no development in him either, but anakin does have to get somebody, and for this challenge, it is really good. but i still look forward to the first darth vaderd) sfx is greate) sword fight (1st part) is absolutly great, what belongs the filming. 2nd part: aaaaaaaaaaaahf) the main problem of AotC (as well as in PM) is, that there is no real hero (yoda kicks em all, but he is just yoda), and no real evil (lord sidious isn't big enough, and double lives are always problematical...g) lucas does not try to explain the force with naturalscience anymore. thx god.lucas did a great job, but it is imposible, that any prequel is as great as NH and Empire",8,0,0,16 May 2002
