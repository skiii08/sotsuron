Requiem for a Dream," not so great
","This movie really wasn't near as good as everyone makes it out to be. Yea, there were quite a few parts where the cinematography was pretty slick, and Ellen Burstyn's performance was very good, but an actress and a few slick scenes don't make a good movie. Honestly, I thought this movie came off as one big, long, anti-drug commercial.  One of those stupid, cheesy ones that doesn't make you think at all.  Afterwards, you just think 'Oh, ok.  I shouldn't do drugs.  Now where's my copy of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'?'",1,7,16,7 December 2003
