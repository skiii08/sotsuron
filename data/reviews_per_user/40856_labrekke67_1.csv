3:10 to Yuma," Very weak story
","This is my first comment here on IMDb, and I just had to write about this movie because I can't really understand why it is so highly rated by so many. This one really disappointed me.Yes, the actors Christian Bale and Russel Crowe are magnificent, but the story has so many logical shortcomings and outlaw Ben Wade's (Crowe) actions at the end of the movie would never happen in real life (even if he had a twisted mind, which he really didn't show). All the shortcomings ruined it for me.Since I don't want to spoil the movie I can't really comment on specific episodes, so you will have to make up your own mind about the logic if you watch it.I can't recommend '3:10 to Yuma' even though I usually love both Crowe and Bale movies. Crowe was excellent in films like Gladiator and American Gangster, Bale was great in Batman Begins and The Prestige, but none of the actors could rescue this movie I'm sad to say.",3,9,15,7 May 2009
