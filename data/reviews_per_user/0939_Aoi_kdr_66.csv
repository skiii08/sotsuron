Black Swan," Shocking film!
","It was so scary that it might traumatize me for the time being. I like phsycho-horror movies but this movie was too disquieting to forget. I can't recommend it to everyone.
Nevertheless, it's great as a film to be so mind-blowing. Although, it's too traumatic for me to say that I like it, I'm glad to have watched it. This shock I've got was more than any other films, I think.
They make Nina Sayers, a heroine of this story, stronger and stronger and then break her heart : female jealousy, opperession from her mother and so many external stimuli. Even so, going mad gets ruined all.
Natalie Portman played with very great skill. Her face duriong the acting was so intense.",6,0,0,16 September 2018
Howl's Moving Castle," All members of my family call bacon and eggs 'Howl's meal.'
","I was fascinated Howl completely! So I read the original novel. Then I was surprised because it was more amazing than the movie! I couldn't expect that! Also I was impressed that Hayao Miyazaki could find such a great story. If you like that movie, I also want you to read the novel.",7,0,1,4 July 2019
Catch Me If You Can," Te opening scene was built by cute motion graphics!
","Ah, maybe I cry when I will just see Tom Hanks next time. This movie was based on the true episode of them, a defrauder, Frank Abagnale. But thd most important facter was the detective tried to chatch him. He was Mr.Hanratty.Although they had a hostile relation like a target who was chased and chasing, they got friendships finally. I realized that the criminal also is hurt by himself. Maybe it's possible to prevent some crimes by someone's love. I hope it will be in our society.",7,0,1,29 June 2019
Casablanca," Which word is more harsh, 'You shouldn't say it' or 'I don't wanna hear it'?
","'Here's looking at you, kid.'
In Japanese subtitle, it was translated 'Cheer, for your eyes.' It was so romantic! So I thought it was a kind of sweet musical movies that a cheesy man flirts with a woman. But he didn't sing at all.
It showed their old wounds which they got because of the war. Then they got some abilities to live smartly.
Why do the movies have the good ending make me such comfortable? It was hard to live in a low-keyed way. Inspite of hardness, he had a firm belief and guilty. That's why it had a charm that it sucked me in.'As time goes by.'",8,1,2,13 July 2019
Minority Report," Out of all SF movies, I like it so much!
","The setting of this movie is interesting and the images are beautiful.This is the movie set in the near future where people can predict the crimes what it will be happened. People get caught for an attempted murder or even only just prediction.
Although maybe we think that the setting is extreme, I also feel like we're coming to the future like that now and will be eventually brought there.By the way, I would probably screem in the scene that Agatha got up suddenly.",9,0,1,7 April 2019
John Wick," This's what I need!
","'Was that the Boogeyman?'
'He's not the Boogeyman. He's the guy you send to kill the Boogeyman.'John Wick was really depressed with the death of his wife. Furthermore, he lost his dog which she gave him as a member of his family. So he got very angry and his terrible revenge begun then. The revenge tragedy didn't contain the mind game, he just chased the target and bushed everyone who interrupted him up! I was so excited it on even such a simple setting. I like an extreme person like him!I like the colour scheme like neon and particularly the awesome music! It was so cool! But I was suspicious about the ending.
I found how stupid conceited people are and why they will go to ruin. The flog in the well knows nothing of the great ocean.",7,0,0,27 August 2019
Gravity," If the movie breathes, I like the deep breath of this!
","I felt that I had difficulty breathing for this movie. And the air was so fresh after watching. Alfonso Cuarón fascinate me completely!Ryan Stone was thrown to the universe and was left. I had a heavy heat till watching because it's likely to be in the lack of oxygen. If I were in her situation, I would give up on survival quickly. I'm not good at the silence and the emptiness. Perhaps it's harder to doubt your existance by yourself than the death.
The short of breathe which Cuarón depicted is including suffering as much as I don't want to watch it again. In spite of it, I am fascinated because my heart is shaken by a katharsis and a salvation enough to surpass them.
The impression and the comedy have the same gimmicks. Those are carried by ups and downs of tension. The more extreme the situation is, the bigger the emotional range is.In Japan, it is called 'Zero Gravity.' But the original title is just 'Gravity.' So I realized that it is based on surviving on the earth while feeling the weight, not meaning of the situation of zero gravity.",9,3,3,24 August 2019
Memento," It was too hard to watch smoothly!
","I kept on play and rewind many times. After watching, I referenced the websites of considering about it and had admirations!
I enjoyed the great entertainment like a game or a challenge.How great or crazy the director made such a detailed movie!",6,0,2,15 June 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," My favorite was a blind swordsman.
","More than anything, actions of Donnie Yen, who played a blind swordsman, was so awsome! I wondered if his role was based on 'Zatoichi.' Although I didn't know him till then, I liked him very much with this movie!In the last scnens, I was suprised and said 'What did he do!?' Including this, I like his role.",6,2,4,8 May 2019
Zootopia," It's the first time I have gone to watch to the theater.
","It was full of dream and hope. Additionaly, it contained a serious theme. People often say 'you won't lose anything by giving it a try.' I wonder if this word is for this movie because I didn't find negative facter. Or rather, it was full of positive emotion all over! Personally speaking, it is one of the best Disney movie.All characters are cute and the world view is enjoyable. The funniest character is folivora, Flash. He almost made me hyperventilated because of laughing so hard. That was the bomb!Although I usually watch movies dobbed in Japanese, I prefer the subtitle about this. The best thing is feeling more immersed at the closing!",10,3,4,11 May 2019
The Danish Girl," Amazing Costumes!!
","Lily, the protagnis, was a first person who had sex reassignment surgery. As I'm female, I imaged how her wife felt in every scenes. So I was depressed. Maybe Lily was awful of the acceptance of her own sex and the new challenge. But I felt like she was a bit selfish against her wife and annoyed her behaviors.I know a similar case nearby. She did married with her husband without knowing that he loves only men. That marriage was just camouflage for him. After the disclosur, she was so hurted and they got divorced. When I heard it, I felt awful. Because it was related with all.",5,3,4,15 June 2019
Ed Wood," How much is the price of pure heart?
","Starring Johnny Depp as Edo Wood, who was called the worst movie director in the world. I felt Edo was too kind for everyone. So I wondered if he couldn't shot movies he wanted to create truely. And they didn't hate why he was an infinite pure-hearted.I didn't know that Tim Burton was a fan of him! Maybe the reason was their same backgrounds they were just in minority.",3,0,1,13 June 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," I want to jump on Totoro's belly!
","In spite of a blockbuster, studio Ghibli doesn't make the sequel of this movie. I couldn't forget that reason Mamoru Oshii talked about. It is jusw that Hayao Miyazaki never wants to put Totoro on the commercial basis as a character. Then I felt his love for his own works so much.Today, Japanese tend to admire living in an old house in a country have been increasing. I wondered if physiolatry was engraved in their genes.",5,0,2,6 July 2019
Midnight in Paris," I felt I wanted to travel there right now!
","What a beautiful night view Paris has!Many famous names that literature lovers couldn't resist appeared in this movie! My favourite was Salvador Dalí! I liked his strange behavior!
You can watch it freely because it's only 90minutes.",4,0,0,1 July 2019
Cloverfield," What do young people who are familiar to YouTube think about this movie?
","The steadicam shot how people escaped from a large mysterious creature what came up suddenly like a video recording. I wondered if it was similar to live broadcasts on YouTube. It reminded me 'Chronicle' and 'Son of Saul.'I was depressed because I felt like I had been in such a cruel situation. Nobody would be happy.
But the style of photography was effective enough to have felt such realistic! Although I never want to watch it, it was a great movie.",6,0,0,12 July 2019
Tangled," This movie comes next to the most romantic story, 'Beauty and the Beast'!
","I couldn't resist! This is a true fairy tail! Also I want to see the 2D animation version!It was the liberation story for Rapunzel. She was a princess who had been confined in the tower in the deep forest for 18 years because of her magical hair. I liked this distance between nature and civilization, I meant the kingdom. It made me feel like I saw a different world. I feel wonder and dream because there are undeveloped regions like 'Princess Mononoke.'I was fascinated by unique and cute characters she met on the way. One of them was a one-armed pianist and another was a strange pantomime actor. I really like these playfulness of Disney. My favourite was a big man loves unicorns. I was surprised at the physical ability of Maximus, a horse chased around Eugene, the theif, with insistence.An action scene in the canyon was intence and worth seeing! I wondered how the location setting was. It looked too clean and tidy though. Was it based on Grand Canyon or any mountain dams?",9,1,1,22 June 2019
Interstellar," It's necessary to watch it again.
","Until the middle, I had thought that this movie was epic.
But I couldn't understand well and wondered its integrity from a scene of five dimensional space. Maybe I was sleepy.I should watch it again another time.",7,0,2,20 April 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," What do you leave for your success?
","Although the aftertaste was good, I wasn't satisfied with the ending. Because ' the devil wears Prada' Miranda had her perfect philosophy against her job.I agree with her thinking of job that all is the result, not the process. That's exact her indication. In the business scene,the progress and the accident don't matter. It works in only resumes. This story depicted 'the progress' mainly, but, in the ending scene, Andrea smiled, 'Even though the result is same, the progress is so different.' So I didn't get it because Miranda was just a bussiness woman with poor personality rather than the devil. I never think that it's worse to get success and keep my own pride by devorting all my effort.Just I knew well that people like Nigel were the most necessary in the world. If everyone were like Miranda and Andrea, the world couldn't work.",6,0,0,31 July 2019
Ant-Man," Like Alice in Wonderland!
","An Exciting movie! I really enjoyed in plan meeting and training scenes!A man was selected as a hero to protect from an abuse of reducing the size technology! Although he was a pretty criminal, he also had an outstanding athletic ability.
I thought it had great visual effects and showed it more effective. I was impressed with some scenes. For example, he was sucked into a drain and flew on the ant. I felt it was similar to Alice in Wonderland! At first, I felt a lot of ants very creepy, but it was funny that I saw them cuter in the last half.The most exciting thing was the way to show that Antman made the enemy consused by controling his size freely in the battle!",7,1,1,19 June 2019
Nightcrawler," The truth or newsworthiness?
","After watching this, I can't look Jake Gyllenhaal in my eyes normally. He played role of the crazy cameraman. It left an awful impression on me. The power of his eyes was too strong!By the way, I wonder the media have morals and considerations for general people whenever I see overheated coverages and even gossips. Sometimes I feel like it's rather unemotional than imprudent. The achievement makes people so? If so, maybe you can say the successes are like a kind of drugs.",6,0,0,16 June 2019
The Bourne Identity," Matt Damon fascinated me!
",The setting was interesting! My favorite was a driving scene! I must watch this series immediately.I did't see why Matt Damon was so popular till recently and I don't think he is a nice looking guy still. But his kiss scene was very awsome. I was so suprised.,8,1,1,8 May 2019
Spirited Away," Sometimes I looked this movie up without realizing. But I didn't know why I did it.
","This is one of the best animations by Hayao Miyazaki. I appriciate that I was born in Japan everytime I watch it.It contains huge information as much as I cannot stop talking. For example, the ambiguity of the boundary between a spirit world and ours, a sacred atmosphere and crime and punishment. If I hadn't been born here in this time, maybe I couldn't see it neatly. I don't know another such dreadful movies from deep inside of the body except for Princess Mononoke.",10,0,0,12 July 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," I love it! This's Edgar Wright!
","To date with the girl who Scott Pilgrim likes, he has to beat seven ex-boyfriends of her!
It had the funny development. For example, the psychic battle was happened suddenly and the alphabets of the sound came from the guitar. It was similar to comics! Also, the cool effects like the animes were used a lot in the images!I thought the battle scene looked like the fighting games or rather the movie. I laughed the most in the Bollywood dance scene. But I prefer the live scenes than the battles.",8,0,0,29 August 2019
Enchanted," The reason why everyone loves Disney.
","Brilliant!! I thought Disney makes fun of itself about the gap between its own taste and the real world in this movie. But it was more nice than I expected!Giselle behaved like so princesses even though she was in the real. She reacted to everything exaggeratedly. It turned the others off. They replied to a drama princesses cynically. But it meant Disney creators made it while saying something, right? If so, I feel a sense of closeness with them. Giselle called 'her friends' from the forest and put even a cockroach on her fingers. You know, it's made by Disney!
We live in 'the world nobody can swear to love forever.' That's why I admire such a romantic story!",8,4,4,29 August 2019
Independence Day," 'Independence Day' never stop being exciting!
","Although I have watched this movie many times since I was child, I never get boring. In retrospect, it's not perfect. Maybe there were little things that didn't quite fit but the outline was beguiling. The president was my favorite.",7,1,2,20 April 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Villains are necessary for the games!
",I think this is just as good as Zootopia in Disney movies. I strongly prefer it than the Frozen. I wondered if the reason why it wasn't a blockbuster was the stage of games.But its colorful images and funny characters were so exciting for me. Villains are necessary for the games!,8,1,1,9 May 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," This's a well-finished work in perspective!
","In spite of an innocuous and an elusive story, I'm surprised it wasn't that boring. The attention to the details that went into making it was really good! The colors, the music, the buildings, the costumes and the videography. All of those are really done well.
Also, the characters and their worldviews are very unique.
Its attraction is a rather beauty of shots and characters' personality than the actual story.",8,1,1,30 March 2019
The Transporter," Frank fassinated me completely!!
","I really like this! I think it's the best of all movies Jason Statham played!
I watched it on TV by chance, and I felt the action movies awsome for the first time.
Then my mother and I were giddy with car actions and called to TV station to presents for viewer. We had looked forward to the next, and we were on standby for it in front of TV that next week.",7,0,0,15 June 2019
Frozen," New two princesses came up from Disney.
","It was too ballyhooed to get a suitable reputation I thought.
In spite of a hot topic, to be honest, I hardly feel it was new. Of course, I enjoyed it because of Disney. But why did people like it so much?
I prefer the musical scene of Anna than Elsa. 'Let it go' became very popular in Japan though.Characters' face moved with animation.",5,3,4,15 June 2019
Dog Day Afternoon," This movie showed a bit funny story about robbers with awkward laughing.
","Most things usually don't go well. It's just common. So I saw that when you plan something, it was very important to have these abilities, collecting information/having flexible thinking/selection members.I felt like a bit annoying with Al Pacino's speech cockily. In the last half, I saw that his environment was bad because most people arouod him wouldn't hear his words. It was easier to push my own opinion to someone. If people around me would be so, I must claim that listen to me even for 2 minutes! ( It's just a lyric of Japanese popular song lol.) The environment kills someone.",5,0,4,30 June 2019
The Hurt Locker," Just the fact.
","This movie was a kind of political movie focused on an explosive ovdinance divisions in Bagdad.The cinematography with the dramatic timing, the actor's face in the close shot. The next moment, the music turned off and then...
There wasn't these performance. It had no music and overacting at all.It showed me how much 'amusement' movies are produced usually and are including the calculation for audience's feeling. Here's just the truth. There was tension they faced in conflict zone. I just only followed it, not aggressively. It wasn't exaggerated like the tragedy. I didn't emphasize with their situation, no anger and no sadness. I just saw the movement of their ambivalent feelings silently. Having said that, I kept gloomy without their actions like getting angry and crying. So I had no choice but to put this feeling into the real with the common ground. It was ruthless terrorism. In term of that, it was so realistic movie I thought.",5,0,1,7 September 2019
Ex Machina," Awsome!
","This movie showed the basic theme was a conflict between human and AI. However I felt it was higher rank than the others had the similar theme because of the beautiful images and richness of content. Why did it become more popular?In spite of a kind of SF, it didn't have elements of action movies and cyberpunk. Or rather it was so quiet. But I felt time flew so fast.",7,0,1,14 June 2019
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," It was crazier than I expected.
","In a small island, a protagnist invented a machine made it rain of food. At first, everyone seemed to be happy. But it went out of control and happened a large disaster!It was just happy kids movie, but was a bit terrible and crazy for me because I'm definitely an adult. In the first half, I smiled at pretty setting like rain of donuts and ice creams! But I didn't feel good like overstuffing myself! The reason was that I know how oily they are!
Pancakes, hotdogs, meatballs, cheeses, donuts and spaghetti. I feel like even only these scripts make my blood thick. So those images were tougher for me!
If I would exchange them to Japanese food, they might be chased by large rice balls, enjoy the pools made by soy soups, a castle of rice dumplings in a sweet sauce. Maybe the rain made by fermented soybeans and hijiki seaweed falls. It seems to be salty!I thought kids would enjoy watching it definitely because of overreaction. Particularly the long sequence a protagnist went toward his laboratory in the last was amazing!",6,1,1,30 June 2019
Children of Men," Though the worldview was dark overall, I like it with cruelness and no hesitation.
","The movie is set in dystopia where men cannot have babies.
The last half scene when Clive Owen and others go down the stairs was very good. I was so implessed that my lips couldn't stop shaking. Children are really innocent and sacred, and therefore many people can feel it--regardless of their positions, languages and wealth.I didn't realize the famous 10 minutes long takes because I knew it after watching it.
How peverse this director is! He shot long takes in that chaotic scene.
By the way, I was so surprised that VFX breakdown came up when looked giving birth scene up. The baby herself was CG!? Amazing...",8,0,0,12 August 2018
Mulholland Drive," The dark side of Hollywood.
","It was too difficult to understand and was filled with the madness. That's why I felt sad when I got the true meaning.Broken thought carried the weight as heavy as it couldn't keep without fabrication of the illusion. Dreaming takes a huge risk as much as you ruin yourself. It's hard to rip down the pride and jealousy if you would get them only once.By thd way, I was so afraid of the expression of elderly couple! It was filled of the madness!",6,1,3,4 July 2019
The Imitation Game," I was interested in enigma so much, but...
","I felt like this movie was peculiarly long even though it was only for 119 minutes. Maybe I had very high expectations for it because So I had wanted to watch it from the released day. I'm interested in enigma so much.
Although I didn't get bored, I couldn't watch it comfortably with the hyperbolic messages.",6,0,0,21 April 2019
World Trade Center," I knew how cruel the influence except for actual harm was.
","When I was a high school student, I watched this movie. Then I went to a theater with my friend, had an omrice and talked about many things and took photos before watching. Looking back, I shouldn't watch it for enjoyment. It was very serious story. I'm afraid of narrowness of my view and innocence.I remember a character who commited suicide because of pain. Even if people could survive from terrorism, sometimes their hearts would be die. I knew how cruel the influence except for actual harm was.",4,0,0,13 July 2019
The Dark Knight," The expectantion was too high.
","I had thought American comics are centering only on actions and exhilaration, so the stories and details are rough instead. I didn't know it had such a deep drama!The design was so cool. And the background music gave me a chill. I wanted to watch it in a theater. I felt the statement of theme was a littele pushy. It was alright. Probably these factors made my expectation higher because of word of mouth.
If I had watched it in the theater, maybe I felt different impression.",7,0,0,13 May 2019
Pride & Prejudice," Elegant images.
","If you have daughters, you will be impressed in the last scene.
This's a hierarchical romance in a countryside in the UK. All scenes were beautiful and elegant, especially the one whicn of the cover design.The protagnist was the second daughter in Bennet family, Elizabeth. She was strong-willed and ironic. Conversely, her elder sister, Jane, was very shy. Also, she had noisy younger sisters and their mother was a bit imprudent.Even if Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy liked each other, it was hard to see something in the close perspective. Maybe I have been bound by the pride and prejudice without knowing, too. It's hard to discard them. They're something to only protect myself, not to gain anything. If those would disturb me, I should discard absolutely. Then, I can see everything in new perspective.",6,0,0,31 August 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The irresistible quote!
","The last quote of Clementine told me about all of this love story. I can't resist!
I wonder if it's not exaggeration to say the movie is for only that one quote. It feels great seeing that makes total sense.The way to show the memories was amazing! It has the worth seeing. I was scared the mosaiced face though.",8,0,1,22 April 2019
3 Idiots," How great we have good friends from school!
",I heard this is a masterpiece. But it was too long for me. I was very sleepy while watching it. The dancing scenes were enjoyable. I admire the school life of boys.It told me that friends from school were the most valuable treasure in my life.,5,2,3,11 May 2019
Life Is Beautiful," How deep father's love is!
","I was not good at war movies. But I like only this from my childhood. In any situation, deep love helps people.",8,2,3,4 May 2019
A Clockwork Orange," Everything was very aesthetic sense : avant-garde fashions, interiors and even the music!
","I felt such crazy and immoral content was rather graceful because Alex enjoyed himself committing these atrocities with no restrains. I could't get enough of it!No matter how cruel the scenes of violence and brutal rape were, I kept watching. I could stop it unlike him though. For boys, vice is equal to pleasure. Alex didn't feel guilty. I wonder if that's why violence scenes were showed us in such a funny way. It wasn't madness.
Punishment for his crime made another crime again. I think punishment and correcting given by the others was a bit meaningless probably.Adults who used and abused juvenile delinquents were even more immoral. There's no such thing as absolute good and evil.",10,0,0,13 May 2019
Beauty and the Beast," 130 minutes filled with dreams
","Why do we tear up in some sad scene and feel ecstatic in some happy one? Even though we already know development and ending.
The quality of musical is no way inferior to the animation film. This is the best but I've always liked the animation one. I want to watch with my child in the future.
Gaston was truly depicted!",9,1,3,14 July 2018
Titanic," If I would watch this in 3d.
","I remember that the nude scene kept me uncomfortable because I watched it with my father then.I feel sad every time I watch the rise and fall of luxury cruise ship. I was impressed with a captain and band left on the shinking ship. They accepted to be with the ship quietly.
I was so afraid of the scene people came off from the careening ship. It traumatized me because I have acrophobia. If I watched it in 3D, it would be more scary.",7,2,4,7 July 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," What's the solution?
","The movie showed the story about a member of CIA hunted down Osama bin Ladin.
At first, she didn't want that assignment. But it turned her calling when she found even just a few possibility. Even if it was justice, it looked like the hunting. In the detective dramas and the war movies, everyone fights and hunts down the enemy for each justice. I wonder if I enjoy because I have a hunting instinct, too.A lot of people became and suffered mental illnesses. Someone tries to forget the incident, other was obsessed with it pathologically. Even so, the indiscriminate terror attacks have been caused still. She played a big role in the mission though.",7,2,3,16 August 2019
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs looked too lonely.
","I didn't sympathize with this story at all, or rather, this role of Jobs sucked. Originally, a biography may not be suit to my taste.
How do peple who respect him genuinely feel if they watch it? I couldn't imagine.",1,0,2,12 June 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," I heard it's like GHOSTS 'N GOBLINS.
","Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) kept spending 'the last day for human beings' repeatedly. He had been killed many times too easily. I remember this situation a lot. The sudden encounter with popping out enemies, the hard obstacles and the various traps what kills most of beginners. These rimind me a hard stage whiah I retried 46 times! When the video game would be adopted into live action movie. it will be made like that. It's bizarre a little.The savage thing was that he had to start over when he was killed. There's no save point. So, the fortune hardly worked. He had to grasp the action petterns of the enemies and the others completely. You know, it's a basis of the video game!If you're tired of playing, you can get the rest. But he wasn't allowed to do it unlike you. It lookes very tough.
The action scenes using the battle suits was pretty intense!",6,1,4,30 August 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," Too valgar
","It was very displeasing to me because of a lot of vulgar scenes. I felt all it said was only sex, drug and nihilism.",2,1,3,4 May 2019
The Green Mile," The absurdity of racial discrimination.
","I didn't realize that this movie was 188 minutes long! Now that I'm older, I may feel lazy for watching such a long movie. It was lucky that I wached it when I was a child who had no bias.As a child, I was impressed and so shocked at this absurdity rather than sadness. Because it was so far issue for me then. I felt racial discrimination exists only in the moral education in school. Its visual had influence on me so much.It had an orthodox moral theme : what the beauty of heart is and the racial discrimination is such unreasonable.
However, it was never so pushy. That's why I like it.",7,0,0,13 May 2019
Inception," The intellectual entertainment with premium quality!
","At first, the theme of this movie 'dreams' is interesting. I guess that Christopher Nolan must be a geek obviously because I hardly ever watch such an exciting movie what the setting and gimmicks were built superbly like this. Or rather, I wonder if he is a deviant person.I was shocked in the scene of the training that Cobb altered the structure of a city in order to show Ariadome the rules in the dreams. I think that many people were fascinated in this scene.
But my most favorite scene is the sequence of the elevator.",8,1,3,7 April 2019
The Secret Life of Pets," Sooo cute! Please let me bury fur!
","What are pets doing in house when their owners are absent? This movie depicted it amusingly! Maybe all owners had thought the same even once.It's totally obvious that they hate human if they were betrayed. Everyone want to be loved.In the middle, I felt awful of the crazy scenes like Sausage Party. It was a mad place...",5,0,2,15 June 2019
Finding Dory," It is necessary to be generous.
","How much had CG technology of this movie advanced from previous work 'Finding Nemo'? I'd like to try to compare them.I couldn't focus the story because I got annoyed with forgetful Dory so much. Don't forget, Dory! So I realized my heart was rough because I reacted it seriously. I reflect upon being narrow minded. I should forgive the others.",5,0,0,8 May 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," What a strong presence by Dr.Hannibal Lecter!
","I couldn't watch the whole film without being disquiet. The camera filmed him brilliantly.
Even though he was just stood up and looking, his pathology made me get goosebumps when the first meeting scene with Claris happen",9,1,2,12 August 2018
Amélie," Amazing images!
","I had a bias that girls who behaved fashionably adduced it as their favourite movie often. But I realized that it was really fashionable!
It wasn't only unique but also had a cosistente story faithfully. I expected it was too unique to like it for everyone though.I felt like it was one piece of pure change of Amelie's heart, was not just only their love story. As it went to the end, I enjoyed threads of foreshadowing which got pulled together!
Maybe I will be hooked into French moives!",8,0,1,11 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I might know a bit the reason why this series has fascinated everyone.
","Although it was the first time I watched Star wars series, I was so excited! Above all, it had a really nice pace! I felt it was like comic for boys.By the way, it must have not been only me who was suprised blowing Kylo Ren's cover with disarmingly simplicity.",8,4,33,9 May 2019
The Matrix," The cool Sci-Fi!
","I got the reason why everyone is obsessed so much!
Although a famous scene of bullet dodge took something out of context, I was so etxcited at another action scenes!",7,0,0,4 May 2019
Godzilla," Awsome remake.
","Although I can't watch all of Godzilla series, I watched even a previous movie for preparing for new one at least. Maybe I watched some of them in my childhood but I've forgotten. So I enjoyed the setting and the concept purely.Hollywood version Godzilla had a thick neck! I guessed its design made sense more in physically than the original one like animations. I felt like I would be traumatized on the aliens similar to large insects. But it was kind for me because it didn't burst like MIB. It was doubt whether it had much of a presence though.
I know a famous episode of 'Shin Godzilla' that Godzilla's skin was based on bitter melons. How about Hollywood version's? Don't tell me that it was based on the same!In some scenes, I couldn't see in detail because of the darkness, but the story was simple and clear. I felt a good thing was the story without a twist.",7,0,2,22 June 2019
Jackie Brown," Which side does Jackie Brown take with after all?
","It kept me in suspence until the last minute. I wish it would be shorter.
Jackie Brown was in an accomplice in crimes behind working as a flight attendant. Ordell, her partner, believes nobody. And a racist police and a smart bail bondsman.'Look at me when I'm talking to you!'
Although Ordell was similar to Big G from Doraemon, I mostly agreed with what he talked because of reasonable. So maybe I'm also like Big G.",5,0,0,26 August 2019
Spectre," What did fans of 007 series think of this? Or, how did I feel if I watched it without preconception?
","It was the first time watching on that series. But I was shocked at differences from my previous imagination. Maybe my understanding was wrong originally.
I imagined that James Bond would be a more cool and smart agent. In spite of that, he was a goof-up, messed up often and couldn't get over women. So I couldn't bear to be broken my ideal Bond who would be hard-boiled guy.
Then I asked my father if that was exact Bond. But he said just yes. I was astonished.Just I liked the opening images of octopus.",4,0,4,16 June 2019
Her," To fall in love with AI of OS.
","At first, she didn't have a perfect personality because AI would learn more and more. It was common to be optimized for users.The flashback scenes in Theodore's view was so warm. But that warmth made me sad. I realized that he had lost it then.
In a little severe content, the images were depicted colorfully. Also, the music was kind. Those're something only this director could do!
I liked the design of a mobile device. I want my phone to change to that OS!",6,0,0,13 July 2019
Donnie Darko," This movie wasn't over until we read the others' review and considering after waching.
",That was too difficult! Also I liked this difficulty so much.I didn't understand at all with only watching it once. But I felt interesting and wonder at the same time. I enjoyed confusing.,8,0,4,11 May 2019
The Birds," An actress was amazing cute!
","An infamous lady as a gossip girl went to a country to get back at a man. But birds' having turned violent happened there. Even the setting was cool!Taking a closer look, the birds were scary. The feet were more dangerous than the beak. They are a kind of beasts exactly.
I was sure that key's birds from Harry Potter were based on this movie. Particularly a shot of getting beaks in a door was just that! I was afraid of just flying birds.",8,1,3,13 July 2019
Princess Mononoke," I feel I like this the best every time!
","I remember it in detail as much as I can imagine easily. But I was usually impressed with new discoveries every time I watch it.
It's the true best of Hayao Miyazaki works. And I think I won't be able to find such a great work in the future!I wondered that some differences caused an exclusion. Eboshi was also excluded from that age. And gods and mononoke were symbols of excluded people and creatures.",10,0,0,13 July 2019
The Martian," The death or resolution.
","The most important thing is the knowledge itself, but the wisedom for working it.
Watney starring by Matt Damon was left alone in Mars. That sounds serious, but actually it was not. It reminds me the old TV program. In that, a comedian lived alone only by the lottery. It was similar to this.A few days ago, I asked my coworker if she has watched it already. But her reply was so funny! She asked me, 'It's a story about the growing potetos, isn't it?' I was so surprised!! As she got it like that, actually it's a positive survival.",5,2,2,22 August 2019
The Godfather," The weight of the inheritance.
","I could find several parts what the mafia philosophy and the manly sentiments are.
The words become like a wet blanket in the face of these great images. I always felt what a romantic life of the man is every time I touch in such great masculinity.Although the Corleone family is a criminal organization, they have their own rules and behave themselves coherently. This is the reason I feel they are awesome.
They act cool-headed, but I feel the charity and the warmth of humanity at the same time. The man with the coherence is absolutely cool.The god father's back told us their philosophy and the manly sentiments were. Michael was gradually piling himself on his father's back.
The dignity of mafia should reflect to 'the brand image.'I got a goosebumps with the change in Michael's appearance he got more and more distinctive as Don Corleone. When I saw the beggining of the movie again, I was so surprised! Who was he? So I'm thrilled to think each of his just action.",10,0,0,22 June 2019
