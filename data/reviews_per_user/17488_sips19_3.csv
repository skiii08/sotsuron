10 Cloverfield Lane," Was far from what I expected, a must-watch for thriller and sci-fi movie buffs alike.
","Was quiet long, but intense. John Goodman did an exceptional job at playing his character (Howard), as expected and couldn't have done anything more to improve it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also did a good job, which came as a surprise to me, because I had never seen her playing a lead character in any of the movies I've seen her in before.Climax & Ending: as a sci-fi fliek with a cryptic storyline and an almost perfect ending, I think the movie took waaay too long to get to the climax - as we actually got to see some action, short as it was, towards the end and the audience finally got some answers on what really happened above ground. And although it was short, I can honestly say that the ending was still unexpected and was probably made like that deliberately, so as to set the stage for a sequel.The movie is a perfect example of how quality acting, storytelling and execution from the cast & crew will always beat fancy gimmicks.",7,0,0,11 May 2019
Ghost Rider," Fun to watch and worthy of being added to your collection if you are a fan of movies based on Marvel/DC comic book characters.
","When watching movies similar to this it's quiet hard not to judge the quality of the CGI (or VFX), but I can honesltly say that the quality of the CGI/VFX in the one is quiet good and just about the only descent thing about the movie.",5,1,1,24 May 2019
RED," A quality all-rounder. Entertainment at it's best.
","RED has a great cast, a reasonably straight-forward, but unpredictable and interesting storyline and a sufficient amount of action.It has all the right ingredients with regard to classic/quality movie-making... and is a perfect example of when the seemingly harmless but humble and wise elderly show the young guns of the new skool how it's done and what happens when they really decide to show or display their definitions of crazy.To me Bruce Willlis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman are synonymous with action, insanity, mature English (with class) and wisdom, respectively. (And you can just think of each of them as an all-loving and harmless parent being nice to thier children all their lives... until one day when they drop a bomb and flip and show the child just how extremely knowledgable and really experienced they are)It's such a pity that I saw Equalizer 2 before this movie.If you loved 'Last Vegas', even if it is a comedy with no action, etc., then you'll also love this movie.",7,1,1,2 July 2019
