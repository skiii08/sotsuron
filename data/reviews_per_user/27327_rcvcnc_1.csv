","This movie is without a doubt one of the best Alien movies ever.  David Fincher brought back the mystery of one alien and the weird atmosphere an Alien movie should have.  The movie wasn't packed with action which gave it more suspense and drama.  In Aliens, halfway into the movie I forgot we were in the future.  With Alien3 the setting was so bizarre and imaginative I knew we were in an Alien film unlike James Cameron's Aliens which turned into a silly excuse for a movie.  Alien3 however had the suspense and darkness of the first one, and the dirty reality of what the future might be like.",10,0,6,29 December 1999
