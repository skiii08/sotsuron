The Incredible Hulk," The BEST ever version of the HULK
","Growing up I used to watch the Hulk on TV as a series. I think through the years there were a few attempts at the movie, and then in 2003 Erica Bana starred as the hulk. At the time it was a great movie, and the action and graphics were great.Today I had two and a half hours to kill and I happened to be in a shopping complex that had a cinema. The only films to be starting during this time was The Incredible Hulk and some chick flick. I chose the Incredible Hulk, not expecting much, with mixed memories of Spider man 3, I wasn't really expecting anything great. Gee was I in shock once the action started. I cant recall seeing another comic book come film ever being so good. The graphics are awesome and are all believable, the action/fight scenes are unbelievably great, and awesome, and the film doesn't detract from the action. There is a great storyline which is followed, all blended in with sub plots and a twist. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler deliver excellent performances.Make sure you go to the toilet before you watch this film, as you don't want to miss any of the action.This is a great film if you want jaw dropping action and fight scenes. There are some funny moments thrown in and at the end, you are left wanting more....you don't realize that two hours have just passed.If you want a feel good action movie, then this is for you.",9,4,10,12 June 2008
