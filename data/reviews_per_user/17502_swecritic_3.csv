The Avengers," Hyped, yet solid.
","The Avengers is exactly what I feared it would be, nothing more than a typical superhero action movie. In contrast to Nolan's Batman films, it feels weak and shell-less. Sure, there are radical action scenes and the film is in many ways true to the comics. However, it is not, what its recently and often alleged, a masterpiece. It is just like many previous films, hard-cooked popcorn action (surely inspired by Transformers effects) but not more than that. The lack of manusscript, depth, sound track, pace and sometimes actor-performance is no where near a masterpiece. The SFX, as i mentioned, are very well though. Yet, a movie by comic-book-fans for comic-book-fans. Maybe that is its weakness or its only strength?",6,4,10,22 August 2012
Hugo," Expected more, despite the magic
","After reading reviews who praised Hugo to the skies, my expectation grew equally. I though I was going to see a spectacular adventure in 1930's french, told to perfection. Hugo is not that.Hugo is magical and has a fantastic tone and somewhat nice pacing. A lot of the pictures displayed are amazing and astonishing, yet not over doing it. In that perspective the movie is fantastic. You can't really create better movie magic. Anyhow, this is not the whole truth. Even though the cinematic, all the camera angles, the music, the pacing, everything is perfectly executed the movie sometime lacks in several other dimensions.For example, the actors are sometimes a little bit tense and the dialogue feels thick and unrealistic. Especially the dialogue between the children. Sometimes the story feels disjointed and a little bit rushed. Also the editing sometimes seemed a little bit accelerated. Also, the story lacks surprises and are mostly very predictive which is boring for movie regulars.They should have 'fin-tuned' some pieces in this movie if they wanted to create a 'masterpiece'. The story is also not what I expected even though I liked the movie-history lesson, but I wanted something bigger and more exciting. Anyhow I think Scorsese and the movie team are proud over the film. It is one of the best child-movies made in recent years and also very educating. But it does not meet the potential it could have reached and is not something 'out of the ordinary'. But if you're looking for a chance to dream away into another time and experience a storytale with great warmth, magical tone and some laughs it may be just what you're looking for.7.5 / 10",7,2,4,2 March 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," A surprising improvement, that left potential
","Firstly off. The casting, and the execution of the casting was great. Garfield outplayed Maguire by miles. Most of the acting was spot on. I do though believe that Ifans and Sheen could have done better, but It was mostly because the manusscript could have been a little bit better. For example, the main theme of spiderman has always been 'With great power, comes great responsibility'. We never witnessed that on the screen. That was quite a shock. Also a few scenes seemed to bee cut off from the trailer. For example a scen where Ifans character Dr Connors says something like 'Peter, you have no idea what you are'. Not in the movie. Maybe it will be on the directors cut.By the way, I saw the movie in 3d and the CGI was a lot better than in the original trailers, which was something I was worried about. Also the humour was most of the time spot on the whole audience laughed together. Yet, I feel there were a lot of space for improvement. For example was some of the action scenes a little bit to long, and sometimes the story felt rushed. Well, primary, what Webb and the guys did, was the best and most accurate spiderman interpretation so far. It certainly had it flaws, but it was an improvement of the old three and in my opinion overrated films. This one had humour, suspense, thriller and even though a lot of questions got answered, they succeeded buildning a story arc they can build on to with another movie, which potentially will make this one even better.My guess for next enemy? Mysterious. A scene after the credits displayed something that made me think of him. But the revealed sickness of Orman Osbourne surely leaves green goblin ready for a role.All in all, good movie, and great entertainmant. A solid 7 / 10 with flaws but with all that you can aspect from a precise executed popcorn flick.",7,1,4,2 July 2012
