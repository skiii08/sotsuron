Requiem for a Dream," Pretentious
","'RFAD' as a lot of the fans, and people within the industry call it.The movie is shot like a music video, which isn't a bad thing. That's the high point. The low point, however - is the poor editing. The driving theme-song that plays throughout the movie pops in during the worst times. The main characters mother sitting in a lawn chair, then walking to a mailbox with a bunch of her friends isn't really the appropriate time for a heart wrenching song, with the drive of a scifi theme-song.After the 15th or 16th closeup of a pupil being dilated, I felt like shouting out 'WE GET THE POINT!'.Those are the movies only real downfalls. If you're into trendy film making, you will probably enjoy this a lot more than I have. I've seen better movies about drug addiction.I was pretty reluctant to see this when it first came out, but since about 10-20 people have told me this is their favorite film of all time: I had to sit through it at least once. It's my suspicion that people quote this as their favorite movie because it has a very trendy/catchy title. 'Requiem' was a hot word for some time, most people don't even know it's meaning. It gets tagged onto movies for no reason (see, AVP: Requiem).Kids.",4,3,5,27 April 2009
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Greatest of all of Speilbergs works, Greatest family film ever made.
","I cannot express how incredible E.T. is. It accurately chronicles the life of kids in the 1980s in a way that is believable. There's the occasional swearing, of course - but what kid around that age doesn't? That's the intense amount of detail that went into this movie. Kids are portrayed as real kids and nothing short of.It's an enchanting tale as well. If you enjoy Spielberg films, or if you just haven't seen this yet - you'd do yourself a favor and go rent E.T., one of the best feats in cinema.E.T. is definitely on my top 5 movies of all time. Sometimes I have dreams about me and my friends running from the cops on our bikes just like in the movie. I'm 22 years old, and I saw the movie when I was very young. It's stuck with me, and anyone else whos seen the film or is a child of the 80s - it'll stick with you forever.",10,1,2,15 May 2007
Casablanca," Rick sticks his neck out for no one
","This is the near-pinnacle of classic film.I first saw Bogart in 'The African Queen', and was very interested in his other roles.Most of the movie plays out in a café. 'Rick's American Cafe' is as classic and memorable of a setting as perhaps the library in The Breakfast Club or the resteraunt in My Dinner With Andre. Me and my fiancée have even gone to the extremes of emulating/replicating Rick's Cafe in the Sims games.This place is a little piece of glamor and refuge away from the troubled north-African continent. People flock to Casablanca to get hooked up with transport to the USA, most of them escaping WW2 ravaged Europe. It's a cultural epicenter. The Nazis understand the town's significance and use it to exercise their influence on the region. They work together with the local French authority to maintain the flow of people (more notably, money) through this port to the western world.Things go a little haywire when a wanted Czech resistance leader decides to show up at Rick's café. With this resistance leader, is the woman Rick has been drowning himself in booze over for years. He becomes drawn to her, and struggles with the task of sticking his neck out for her (and her friend, who has the Nazis on his trail).That's pretty much it.In-between all of the plot twists and sparkly-stuff, there's a few characters you actually care about. There's a setting as classic and campy as only this period of cinema could provide. Bogart is the man, he's one of the biggest on screen bad-asses I've seen in awhile.",9,1,2,5 August 2009
In Bruges," Bruges, I love you
","This movie is beautifully shot and beautifully cast. I was extremely impressed from start to finish. I believe this is the first role of Colin Farrell's that I enjoyed and felt moved by. Ralph Fiennes is always surprising and edges more and more into my list of favorite actors. The guy who plays Ken is barely three-dimensional. He seems very 'normal' compared to the other characters.The film, as you know, is set in the small Dutch town of Bruges. It's an old Medieval tourist town that is seemingly unimpressive to the common person at first glance.Bruges serves as a sort of purgatory for the two protagonists of the film. They are informed to 'lay low' in Bruges and to wait for a call from their employer. The two main characters spend their time exploring the town to pass time. They don't anticipate the danger is right around the corner, their employer being extremely disappointed in their last job.This small town in the middle of nowhere turns into a battlefield, some gladiators battling for honor - some for survival.Lots of laughs, but don't let the comedic aspect overshadow the dark and real subject matter that looms over the two characters. There are many serious themes that are brought very realistically to the screen: Regret, Atonement, Depression, Suicide, Honor killing.Oh yeah, and there's a midget. Score! 9/10",9,1,3,28 October 2009
As Good as It Gets," Good harmless fun
","If you like Jack, this is a must-see.As Good as it gets is pretty campy, and that's what I like about it. I'm usually not one for romantic comedies, but this one stands out in my opinion.Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear have an intense on-screen chemistry. Cuba Gooding Jr. is flawless as usual. The acting, setting, music, cinematography is too good for this genre of movie.The big focus of the movie is on tolerance, acceptance, and sacrifice for greater things. All great themes that are important. That's one thing that a movie has to have to achieve an 8 or higher from me on this site. Importance. Is there some sort of learning experience to be had upon watching this film? For some - yes.I don't want to analyze this too much, I'll just leave it at this: It's quirky, witty, charming, and full of lighthearted fun that I need every once and awhile. I love those big booming heavy-hearted films, but on occasion I'll fall back into something light.This is one of those movies you can watch with just about anyone. It has some swearing and sexual references, which is the only thing that holds it back from being an extraordinary family-film. As much as I am impressed by it's ability to be light and whimsical, there are some dashes of darkness - which feels natural and realistic. It feels less a Hollywood fairytale (as most new romantic comedies are), and more of a modern home-hitter.I fall in love with Greg Kinnear's character more and more every time I see this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if you do as well :) Check it out, even if you're not a fan of romantic comedies.",8,1,1,29 July 2009
The Fifth Element," Stylish sci-fi, too much fun.
","The Fifth Element is not your every-day science fiction. For 1997 the special effects are even better than some of the newer movies today. There's a good balance between puppets/costumes and CGI. I really dislike it when a production relies on CGI alone to just get by. The futuristic rendition of Earth is big and silly, which is a good break from the dystopia we see from most scifis. Bruce Willis is a legend in the flesh with that signature smirk and cool-guy persona. He was the perfect person for the lead role of this film.Milla Jovovich looks amazing in this film. One of the most unique female characters I've seen in a scifi yet. Her 'birth' inside of the cloning tube reminded me of the similar scene in Metropolis. Chris Tucker is amazingly secure in his flamboyancy, this is probably my favorite role of his.Don't let me forget Gary Oldman as ZORG... He is the real champion of this movie. He's monstrously charming, a class-act bad guy. He has some great one-liners that make me giggle every time.The story is pretty top-notch, as well as the subplots that twist throughout the film. Though, the story for me is a mere footnote. This film's strengths lie in the characters and the music/visuals.Speaking of, The music is extremely diverse and well done for a Scifi. The soundtrack is probably one of the best I've heard period.Luc Besson and crew, you win at scifi.",9,6,11,17 September 2009
Terminator Salvation," A Termination of the franchise
","Absolutely horrific.The only thing nice I have to say about this movie is that the preview rocked. It looked so epic and deep. I got the chills every time I streamed it on my PC.I applauded the 2nd trailer for it when I went and saw another movie a couple months prior to the release.'IF WE STAY THE COURSE WE'RE ALL DEAD!' I thought that line was going to be used in an extremely memorable context; That it would be almost as popular as 'I'll be back'. I thought it was going to be used in a dire situation which called for such intensity.Nope.It was used during some scene where dudes are hanging out in an aircraft hangar. Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but the scene was almost like a tourette's outburst. He's yelling at some dude over a radio. There's nothing really going on in the scene. Just some yelling with a few dudes standing around. That's it.You'd expect him to be under fire from a giant horde of robots, him laying in a ditch screaming it into a radio link or something.Nope.Hangar with dudes. No dramatic music. Just out of place yelling into a mic.Don't let me overshadow the other epic failures of this film with this irk of mine. I was just extremely excited for this film, and even dreamt of the preview every night - just days before the release.Everything in this movie is forced. Every single thing. Nothing looks or feels natural. Hell, the flashback scenes of the soldiers vs. the robots in the earlier Terminator movies are MORE ENTERTAINING AND MEMORABLE than this whole movie.I think somebody else said it here, and I'd like to reiterate: This movie makes T3 look like a masterpiece. I'm not joking. I'd rather watch T3 on an Ipod screen without sound than watch T4 on Imax.",3,4,8,11 July 2009
Glory," Ferris Bueller finds time machine, ends up in Civil War
","This movie is awful. The fact that it's in the top 250 is laughable.The head-explosion in the beginning was pretty decent. The characters were pretty forced and unbelievable. The Dread Pirate Roberts guy is a decent actor. Ferris Bueller wasn't.The fake mustache was hilarious. I was confused for awhile and thought he was wearing a disguise or something. I thought there was some secret plot where he was a 17 year old kid who took the identity of some Civil War colonel. Nope, they really did try to pass off the look.Morgan Freeman was the only person who made this movie watchable. He's cool, like ice cold for the first two hours. Then there's this weird prayer session around a campfire where he turns into a raging lunatic. Someone must've snuck some crack into his collard-greens or something. (Not a racist joke, this is what they were rationed back then) Denzel Washington plays the same character he plays in every movie. 'Y'all are racist! Kill whitey!' The battle scenes were pretty archaic and funny, though that is a fair depiction of what old-world-European-style-warfare is. Walk up to each other in horizontal lines and fire your weapons. The looks on the confederate's faces when they saw a wave of eyes and teeth coming at them in the night was pretty hilarious.I'm no racist. I would've fought and died along the sides of these guys back in the Civil War. This story deserves a better movie. I'm extremely disappointed every time there's a movie about something important that misses the mark.But yeah, the head exploding in the beginning was awesome and funny. Better than Scanners in my opinion.",4,8,31,27 July 2009
The Godfather: Part II," Dark and Epic. The downfall of kingdom.
","The Godfather II surpasses the first film.Some of the beef I had with the first Godfather, is the fact that we don't get to see or hear very much about Vito Corleone's past. The viewer gets little snippets here and there, like the 'offer he can't refuse' story at the wedding.Godfather II is a godsend. Vito's character is the crown jewel of the series, and this film focuses heavily on his journey into becoming 'The Godfather' Great scenes of betrayal and revenge. The darker side of the film feels more personal and less like the Sicilian dogma which the first film focuses on. The film splits a fair amount of time between Michael and his father's back-story. Much like the ending of the previous film, Michael allows himself to become a monster. He is a mere shadow of his father, and that is the real message of the film. The actions Michael Corleone take throughout this film would've been dismissed as dishonorable and unnecessary by his father.The cinematography is near perfect. If you want a good story-book depiciton of Tuscany, or turn-of-the-century New York City... there are very few movies that have replicated such craftsmanship.One of the few sequels that is a LARGE upgrade to the original.",9,0,2,18 August 2009
Watchmen," Very WATCHable
","I've half-read the graphic novel before seeing this film. It's a worthy adaptation.The music is a little silly, but I guess that just adds to the dark quirk of it all. The visuals are amazing and stylish. Rorscach was well casted, as well as my favorite character in the movie. Him and The Comedian.The Comedian understood things a lot better than the rest of the team. He was a product of the evil nature of the human race. It wasn't his fault. He did some atrocious things, but in the end it really didn't mean anything. Millions of people are wiped off the face of the planet, all out of merit to the human race. Using death to assure life. Life and death is so natural, the process of how it happens doesn't matter. This becomes clear with Dr. Manhattan's change of heart, when going over the hard truth about Silk Spectre's relationship with her mother and her biological father.There's a lot of eye-opening philosophical themes that float around watchmen. It's heavy in drama, and great dialog.The action is BRUTAL and intense.If you like the candied superhero movies of today, there's a chance you might not like watchmen. It's a very anti-hero story. There's nothing glorious about these heroes. They play out not as saviors, but mere spectators of the events in the story. 'Watchmen' Check it out if you like something with depth.",8,1,4,27 July 2009
District 9," Most brilliant science fiction film since Blade Runner
","It lived up to the hype. I thought we'd get another Cloverfield with the viral marketing campaign.I'm impressed. Most science fiction films don't do that for me. District 9 is widely being hailed as the best movie to come out in 2009. I wouldn't argue with that claim one bit.The visuals are outstanding, the plot/ideas are groundbreaking. Your heart becomes very heavy for these 'Prawns' (a racist term for the alien refugees). They are treated very savagely throughout the film. It feels a bit overdone, but given the grim reality of the state of the African continent... some could say that the level of violence and cruelty wasn't too much.Some of the scenes are almost too cruel to have on-screen. If you were to replace the scary-looking aliens with lets say, a human ethnic minority - I think the movie would almost be too much for even the most hardened viewer.In the end I found myself a bit choked up. I left the theater asking myself questions that were left unanswered (on purpose, possibly to set up a sequel). I know I've seen a great film if I'm still thinking about it the day after.I'm sure District 9 will never be too far from my thoughts.Superb film.",9,7,13,14 August 2009
Drive," Buckle up, the next stop is Oscarville
","I was expecting an Aronofsky rendition of 'The Fast and the Furious'.I was wrong.Brilliant in almost every way, it's the best film I've seen this year. Gosling plays a character reminiscent of Travis from Taxi Driver. The focus of the film isn't chrome spinners or 10 second booty-shots, as a modern car film would suggest. It's smart and stylish without coming off strongly in either direction. The supporting cast were effective as well, especially Mulligan and the unusually cast Albert Brooks. We get to see the big funny-man in a not-so-funny light. Small pockets of extreme violence. Think Death Proof or A History of Violence as far as the action/thriller pacing is concerned.The music and sound in general rivals Tron Legacy or even this year's Hannah.Drive will more than likely be looked over considering what it's up against, it's box office pull will undoubtedly reflect this. But isn't that the usual story? Financial flops are usually of critical success and vice versa? Anyhow, this film has ... driven ... my expectations of the genre to new speeds.Uh... you get the picture! Go out and see it!",9,3,8,29 September 2011
Amadeus," Annoying laugh, great flick
","hahahahahaha! That's a good sum of this movie. There's some pretty dramatic sequences that suck you in... only to be distorted by this weird high pitched laugh 'Wolfie' bellows out every 10 minutes.I don't know if I'm complaining or not. It's pretty fitting for such a wacky guy... I don't know. There's some scenes where he's dealing with the uptight German nobility that get pretty tense, but then there's almost a laugh-track that happens at every pivotal moment. The laugh track being Mozart's high pitched awfulness.Vienna looked awesome, and the costumes/sets were very very believable. I didn't think I'd enjoy a movie like this.I knew about halfway through the film that It was gonna be a movie that stuck with me forever. There's this awesome scene where Mozart ends this song with an epic fart. He even flips up his jacket-tail to give more umph to the experience.Annoying laugh, great flick.",8,2,3,8 September 2009
Paranormal Activity," Best suspense/horror film of all time!
","I am truly impressed with this film. I'd like to have seen it under the context of not knowing it's reputation. Maybe it was just because I anticipated it being so scary? I had a slew of people and reviews that told me it was the most disturbing film they've seen.I couldn't pass it up. Me and my fiancée hit up a late-night showing of this film. It was worth it. I couldn't sleep that night.The production is hokey and unimpressive. About as unimpressive as a home movie/documantary... hey wait, isn't that what they were going for? This movie pulls off a very legitimate 'documentary' feel. Most of the scary parts of this film aren't even action-filled. There's no goopy-goblins jumping out at the screen, to follow their 'rising tension' synth-string cues. There isn't a big chase scene. There isn't even a fight/battle with an antagonist. It's simply a film that gets it's scares from the viewer itself.My heart was racing even before any sort of 'Paranormal Activity' was on the screen at all. The build-up to these horrific scenes of ghostly-shenanigans is gut-wrenching. The characters react in a very personable way to their encounters with the paranormal. The male character is a 'tough guy' when it comes to this stuff. He think's ghosts are 'cool' and 'interesting'. You begin to realize that this is a defense mechanism. He's just as scared as anybody would be.The film goes from scary to uncontrollably frightening in a well-paced manner. Some of the eeriest things I've ever seen happen in the most subtle ways ever. In most movies, ghosts put on this big laser-light show with tons of CG and spooky tricks. The ghost in this film behaves in a very calculated way. It feels like an antagonist character, although you really don't get to see it on-screen. You get an idea of what this 'ghost' looks like, given the type of activity it presents throughout the film. The film utilizes the imagination of the viewer to a great level of success.I'm one of those guys who watches Horror films for gags. I rolled my eyes and scoffed at the first 5 minutes of this film, I admit. There were people in the theater who were actually yelling things at the screen, showing off how non-scared they were.When the 'Paranormal Activity' occurred on the screen... the theater was SILENT. The peanut gallery were trembling just as hard as the characters in this film.I have YET to have such an exciting cinematic experience. I give this a 9 out of 10. I would give it a perfect 10/10 had this film had a more well-thought-out ending.Go see it. Take your friend that 'isn't scared of anything'.Intense. Realistic. Eerie. Great film-making.How does somebody with a gazillion dollar budget like Michael Bay make movies that I don't react to in any way (as if I were just looking at an advertisement in a magazine) - and some inexperienced production can make me lose sleep... on like $10,000? Filmmakers should take notes from Paranormal Activity.",9,3,6,19 October 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," Celebrating space and it's epicness
","1968...This movie looks TOO good to have been made so long ago. The visuals look better than most rushed scifi pop these days. The actors interact with their environment in ways that are confusing and jaw-dropping at the same time (noteably the 'floating pen' scene).The climactic sequence between Bowman and Hal is heart wrenching to say the least. The music is eerie, especially whenever the Monoliths are on-screen. David Bowman is more mechanical and calculating than Hal, it seems. That's kind of a new observation I made when watching it last night. Hal tells Bowman 'I'm sure you are very angry with me right now'. Bowman's demeanor is unchanged. It seems as if he doesn't react to almost anything at all.I really wished there would be more of Hal 9000. He's a great character, probably the most entertaining character in the whole film.The only thing I didn't like about 2001... Bowman's transformation into the Star Child. Bowman baby is probably the scariest and bizarre creature on screen aside from the Eraserhead baby.Great moments of space-shenanigans to classical music.Probably the most artistic sci-fi ever made.",8,2,6,9 September 2009
The Graduate," The pinnacle of Rom-Coms
","I admit I was a bit shocked when I rented The Graduate. The first thing I did was look at the back of the DVD box. I saw a 'PG' rating. I was wondering how a movie about an extramarital affair between a young man and an older woman could receive such a rating. I'm still confused to this day.This doesn't sway me, though. The Graduate is worthy of it's high acclaim. Ben, played by young Dustin Hoffman is really awkward on screen. This doesn't take away from the film though. He successfully plays how I felt when I lived back home. When grandparents came from out of town to visit. 'What do you want to do with your life?' - I ran from those questions, just as Ben does in the film. His family and their upper-class friends are bent on him succeeding and going to grad school to make his career. Ben just wants to be. That's it. He has a hard time making connections with people, and it turns out the first real connection he has with anybody is the wife of his father's co-worker. This sets the stage for some sequences of extreme awkwardness. I loved every second of it. Dustin Hoffman's quirk and boyish charm is unmatched by most characters in the Rom-Com genre.If you've at a time ever felt threatened by your parents expectations, or the pressure to be something in society that you're not - you might make a strong connection with this film.The cinematography was great. The music was FANTASTIC. The whole soundtrack was done by Simon and Garfunkel. I was a little hesitant at first, I thought it would be a bit too much. It really sets in after about a hour through.I can't get the scuba-in-the-pool scene out of my head. This movie will be one I lump into screw-the-world classics like Ferris Bueller's Day off and American Beauty.",9,1,2,24 August 2009
Once Upon a Time in America," Rated R version of The Little Rascals
","This movie was Ehhh.It was somewhat watchable, and I loved the music. There's some really unique pan flute tunes that play throughout the movie. For a gangster flick, I expected the music to be some sort of Sicilian folk tune. I was pleasantly surprised.The rest of it though... hmmm...There were a lot of extremely unnecessary scenes. Lots of scenes of kids doing a bunch of messed up stuff. Mugging people and using the money to pay an underage prostitute, stabbing adults with a switchblade, etc.There wasn't a single sex scene that was decent. There's a 50ish year old cop having intercourse a 13-14ish year old girl. There's countless amounts of rape as well.The movie didn't do very much for me. It was long-winded and artsy... with a splash of child exploitation here and there.This is probably the worst Leone film I've seen. I did however like James Woods, he's a terrific actor. Young Jennifer Connoley is in this, and her eyebrows are just as bushy.I'd probably give this a 6 or a 7 if it wasn't 4 hours long.",5,3,8,27 July 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Blandsformers
","Transformers: Revenge of the FallenEvery now and then I need a reminder of how much summer blockbuster action films suck. I also need a reminder of the general stupidity of the American public for financially supporting such movies.I'd like to say that I'd rather watch Battlefield Earth or maybe even Space Jam on repeat for 24 hours straight than watch this abomination of a film. I'll keep this short and sweet with a list of pros and cons.Pros:<ul><li>3 hours in an air conditioned dark room. - Energy drink I snuck in. - The ceiling of the theater looked pretty cool. - Going to bed that night and waking up not even remembering Transformers until someone at work brought it up.</li></ul>Cons: - Megan Fox: She tries to look hot and bothered even during the running for her life/survival sequences. She squirms in her seat and bites her lip like a teenage girl on a date with the most popular boy in school. Her acting is reminiscent of late night Showtime soft-core. - Shia guy: 'BUMBLEBEEEEEEEEE!!!!' He screams and clips out his post-production microphone. Can this guy please be removed from Hollywood? Wasn't he on Nickelodeon or part of the Mickey Mouse club or something? His character in this movie is worthy of casting him in a possible 'License 2 Drive II' - Devastator getting shot by a 'railgun' on a ship... just conveniently in some body of water within viewing distance from the Great Pyramid. Wow, great way to end a 20-30 minute character introduction/buildup. Get some guy to make a cell-phone call and prank the US Navy into shooting a robot with an experimental weapon. Wow. - Every action sequence. I think Michael Bay might be far-sighted. The first full-body shot of any of the transformers in an action sequence happened to be like 1-1/2 hours into the movie. As much as I love watching random appendages flying across the screen at light-speed with car-brand logos hidden on them, I think I'd rather stare at the back of the persons head in front of me. - Consistent product placement. Do I need to explain this one? - The 'Comedy' relief of the movie - Epic fail. I don't care about Shia's parents from the get-go. I'm pretty sure his mom was reading her lines off an index card in her hand at one point. Im not even joking. - Human-robot-transformer-girl-with-tongue. Nuff said. - About 3 hours long. Think of Lord of the Rings, but subtract all things cool and worthwhile. That's a pretty good summary of Transformers 2. - The fact that people are calling this 'T2'. There's a T2 that exists already. It just so happens to be a movie Michael Bay didn't get to touch: Hence why it's the most highly appraised action movie in the industry. - Tyrese",4,0,4,11 July 2009
Blade Runner," Dark and beautiful.
","Blade Runner, where do I start? It's loosely based on PKD's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. I had the luxury of reading the book before watching the movie. I felt that although there are huge differences between the film and the novel, the overall feel and message was still there.What is life? What is a soul? These questions come to mind as the story of Deckard and the 'replicant' fugitives plays out. The story is phenomenal, the acting is superb. Rutger Hauer is amazing, and instantly became one of my favorite actors of all time after watching the ending sequence where Roy chases Deckard - and notably when Roy interacts with his 'creator'. 'I want more life!' The production quality of Blade Runner is unreal. Made in a film-making era where CG was just being touched upon, and scaled models were still an industry standard; I can't believe my eyes whenever I see aerial views of the city. The special effects were made with extreme care, and are used in a subtle and tasteful manner.The way Deckard interacts with the futuristic city is EXTREMELY believable. I have a hard time thinking that there's a camera crew just barely off screen. The level of immersiveness is untouched by CG scifis like the new Star Wars prequels, for example.It's a visual feast - the characters are perfect, the story and the philosophical questions around it are deep and necessary as well. Nothing feels forced. The setting and it's inhabitants are natural and believable. I watch this movie always wanting more. I wonder what Ridley Scott could've done with a bigger budget and maybe an hour or two more. I heard Blade Runner flopped when it released in theaters. That's hard to imagine. I can't fathom the idea that this movie wasn't successful from the get-go.I'd like to personally say that this is my favorite movie of all time. I think it should be considered as important to the science fiction genre as 'Metropolis'. I don't care what genre of film you prefer, I think everybody who takes anything for more than just face value should give Blade Runner a watch.",10,1,3,11 July 2009
Ben-Hur," Worthy of the title 'Epic'
","Ben-Hur is a BIG movie.Big sets, big characters, big sequences, and big running time (to accommodate such a film) The story follows a Jewish prince who has been wrongfully imprisoned by the Roman empire. He inspires those whom he comes across, and makes his way into becoming a heir to a roman title. He uses this new royalty to qualify to compete against the very man who imprisoned him. It's the classic story of revenge and redemption.There are many biblical references in this film, which aren't too much of a distraction (surprisingly). Ben-Hur comes in contact with the J-Man many times throughout the film.The famed 'Chariot Race' surpassed my wildest expectations. I was jaw-dropped. Nothing of this scale could be pulled off today, with our relatively 'safe' way of film making. This race was the real deal, and I could tell that many of the stunt-men left this production with scars to remember it by.Mr. Heston's intensity was believable. Messala's death scene was brutal. Even compared to the graphic nature of film of today, this older movie shocked me.This movie doesn't have a single splash of CGI. There are a few backdrops, but for the most part: they built whole towns/cities for this movie. Collumns, statues, galleys/warships, the whole thing. It's mind-boggling.",9,0,2,5 August 2009
The Deer Hunter," Most overrated movie of all time
","This movie is a disturbing piece of 'epic' crap that I feel is a waste of time and a waste of money.I admit, I do have a Christopher Walken bias. He's the only character I liked in the movie. The Vietnam scenes kicked rump!!! The rest of the movie... dealing with that Pittsburgh-ish town... WTF? That stuff is so boring and retarded. A bunch of drunken ugly people running around and clipping out the set-mics with their terrible yelling and singing. What the heck? I mean, SO much of this movie is dedicated to scenes of people doing stupid stuff. The wedding scene was like 45 freakin minutes long. A standard length movie is like 90 minutes.I don't see any sort of memorable significance to a bunch of people dancing around at a wedding, or a bunch of guys yelling inaudible things in a bar - then singing a cheesy song in unison out of nowhere.Am I supposed to 'get to know' these terrific characters and understand their deep complexities through scenes of them doing random and useless crap? There are some good/meaningful scenes in the movie. De Niro not shooting the deer at the end, Walken blowing his own brains out, De Niro taking that skinny dudes gun away from him and showing him how hardcore nam-vet he is. That's pretty much all. Oh yeah, when they escape captivity back in Nam.The other 2+ hours of footage is lost on me. I can't believe someone would destroy such a good idea for a movie with useless clutter. Oh, the ending scene was hard to watch. Not because it was sad, because it was a total piece of turd-matter. Porkey pig going into the kitchen and crying over the news of his friend (walken) offing himself in Vietnam(after he was pronounced missing/AWOL WAYYYYYY earlier, quite possibly monthsago in the movie). Everyone else sits around and sings 'God Bless America'.Wow, way to drive the point into my soul *vomit* If this is considered the cinematic eye-opener about the damages of the Vietnam war to communities, well I feel sorry for the American public.I think a lot of people trick themselves into liking this movie way more than any human being should, just because it has a way-rad classical guitar piece throughout all of the poorly executed 'dramatic' scenes. (Cavatina I believe it's called) I have a couple of friends who bring this movie up when we talk about awesome movies everyone should see. WTF? It's in the top 250? HA!",2,12,21,28 July 2009
Rear Window," Original, Suspenseful
","This movie is what got me into Hitchcock films. Being a young buck at the age of 24, sometimes it takes a good kick-in-the-head to understand the value of good storytelling/film-making. If ANY movie these days can make me feel as gripped with anticipation, well you'll probably see a similar review from me on it's page.The campy-ness of this film is what makes it so unique. The story virtually unfolds in front of a voyeur looking out his window. He's debilitated by a broken leg and has to stay home. Watching his neighbors becomes a consuming hobby... and he realizes that something dark and mysterious is happening at the apartment across the way.As I said, most of the scenes play out from the perspective of looking through a window. He watches the lives of his neighbors, however whimsical... or tragic (note: the lonely woman downstairs). I haven't seen another movie like this. It's great when a film-maker can take a simple location, and a simple idea and turn it into so much more.It doesn't help that James Stewart is one of my favorite actors of all time. If you love good cinema, and if you love suspense and mystery - I HIGHLY recommend Rear Window. I'm just disappointed that it took me so long to get around to watching it.",8,0,1,11 July 2009
Heat," Intense cop/robber drama
","The movie looks fantastic. Los Angeles never looked better. As much as I love the more ghetto/gritty side of LA you get to see in movies like Falling Down, I think Heat has the best picturesque setting.The dialog is way over the top, especially with Mr. Pacino. He's a pretty despicable character. I found myself rooting for the 'bad guys' the whole time. They're only 'bad guys' mostly out of desperation. Pacino's character is willing to sacrifice everything for his job... his family, his wife, etc.Val Kilmer was put in a pretty weak role in my opinion. Such a great actor needs something more than what he was given.I think that's my only complaint. Oh yeah, GREAT visuals and cinematics. Best cop/robber shootout EVER.Top shelf Cop Drama.",9,1,3,8 September 2009
The Great Escape," Loved it!
","There was a lot of characters. That usually makes things super-confusing for me. Most movies with a cast like this introduce characters and either kill them off shortly after, or leave them as minor footnotes.I was shocked at how successful the characters were done.The movie takes place at a P.O.W camp deep in Germany. It's a new high-security camp that's ran by the German Army/Luftwaffe. The warden of this camp is a very likable guy. He's really set on the idea of 'sitting out' the whole war and just housing/taking care of these men. The movie quickly points out that this guy isn't a huge fan of Hitler or the Nazi party. He sympathizes with his prisoners and is very good to them. The rules and inspections he enforces are only to maintain order. It becomes very apparent that he doesn't want the prisoners to escape for the only reason that he fears for their well-being. If the SS were to pick them up, who knows where they would end up.Upon entering this POW camp, for a allied serviceman, you are given a task depending on your set of skills. These tasks (or jobs) that you do are part of this never-ending escape machine. It's the duty of most of these guys to at least try and escape.There's a notable relationship between one of the scroungers (gets hard to get items into the camp) and a forger (creates false IDs for escaping P.O.Ws). The forger spends so much time looking through a magnifying glass that he ruins his vision. When the 'Great Escape' is in it's final phases, he's told that he would endanger the operation if he wasn't able to see. The scrounger stands up for him, and offers to be his guide - regardless of how dangerous it could turn out.There's more examples I won't get into, but all of them are a great example of brotherly love and comradery.It was perfectly paced, and you actually gave a damn about the characters.Steve McQueen as 'Hilt' is quite possibly the coolest/most suave character I've seen in a movie. I was cheering the whole time he was tearing ass through Germany on that motorcycle.The music was a bit stereotypical for an older WW2 movie. I'd like to see a more dramatic soundtrack. That's the same complaint I had with The Bridge On The River Kwai.Now that I think about it, these are very similar movies.I liked The Great Escape better.'Great' flick. You won't have the desire to 'Escape' your living room while this movie is playing.",9,0,2,27 July 2009
Sin City," Artistic, Dark, a noir revival
","Sin City... based on the widely praised graphic novel series of the same title.I think the very title of the film is a good indicator of whether somebody should watch it or not. 'Sin City'. You are going to witness sexuality and bloodshed in a way you've never seen before. The CGI backdrop of Basin City is cartoony and unrealistic - but that serves the purpose of the stylizing. Now, the greatest achievement is that Sin City provides the viewer a realistic level of interaction with these comic-book backdrops. The characters are hit and miss. The hits outnumber the misses tenfold, though.Hits: Marv, Hartigan, Junior, Dwight, Shelley, Jackie Boy, Miho, The Irish assassins, Cardinal Roark (BIG ONE RIGHT HERE), Kevin, The Salesman, Becky, Bob, Marv's PO, Goldie & Her sister, and a few others. Frank Miller plays a dirty Catholic Priest Misses: Gail and a couple of the Old Town girls (Dallas notably). The lines seemed a bit forced. This doesn't knock my 10/10 back to a 9, though. I understand that while Rosario Dawson isn't the best actress to play a femme fatale like Gail, she's definitely cut out for the look. And if you know anything about Sin City... the 'look' is what sets it apart from other noirs. Jessica Alba was the right girl to play Nancy... It's just I don't appreciate her acting enough to count her as a hit. The little girl who played young Nancy was pretty spectacular (and adorable). I mean, it's difficult to place a newer actress like Jessica Alba alongside with industry veterans like Bruce Willis, Michael Madsen, Micky Rourke, etc. I'm not saying she's a bad actress. I'm just saying the other people involved are some of my favorite character actors/actresses and it created a huge contrast.Anyways, I'm cutting this review off here.The story is great, the lines are well delivered for the most part, and the artwork does justice to the graphic novels. You can watch this without being a fan of the books. If you like sex, violence, and good story-telling... do yourself a favor and go rent this.",10,1,3,21 July 2009
Jurassic Park," Dino movies can't recreate the authenticity of JP
","I've seen several depictions of dinosaurs since Jurassic Park. None of them come close.There's a funny story that comes with JP's theater release. When was a kid, I was so freaked out and excited for this movie. I was supposed to fly out to Hawaii for a 2-week long vacation on the day of it's release. Well, to make long story short: I've yet to go to Hawaii.I stayed and saw JP on opening day. It was worth it.The animatronics coupled with the eye-popping CG is still a standard-setter, even compared to more recent movies.The T-Rex is as big and scary as King Kong upon first glance. I had the opportunity to see some of the animatronics behind some of the dinosaurs when I visited Universal Studios. There was a lot of work that went into bringing these creatures to life, and I'm glad this movie still receives the recognition for it's technical brilliance.That aside, The story and characters are great. Jeff Goldblum is a hoot. Sam Neil is one of the most underrated actors of all time. Laura Dern is appropriately casted.There's a scene where the Raptor pen keeper (who has majesticly muscular legs might I add) tells her to 'run as fast as you can' on a hunch that raptors are nearby. Her sheer terror mixed with some fast string-age from John Williams... for some reason this always comes to mind when thinking about this movie. The intensity is enough to make your pulse quicken, especially if you are as sensitive to being as immersed in movies as I.This is a movie for anybody. It's a good reminder that we're very fortunate that dinosaurs are gone - and we are here.Yeah, I'd love to see JP4 be as quality as the first. I'd like to see some animatronic puppetry once-again in film. The dinosaurs and their interactions with humans just seem flat and 2D any other way.Oh yeah, I still have nightmares of being chased by Velociraptors occasionally. I was 8 or 9 when i saw this movie.",8,3,5,13 July 2009
The Godfather," A Movie You Can't Refuse
","Though I don't think The Godfather should be the #2 movie on the top 250, I understand it's importance to the industry. I understand that there's more depth in The Godfather than most movies of the time. I don't know, I keep a pretty open mind to movies and the different eras they were made in. 1970-1980 just isn't a popular decade for me. So far, The Godfather series is probably the best thing to come out of this era (or at least the first two). It's a pretty big hit. I loved it. I just didn't love it as much as the movie masses do even to this day. The story is rich, and Vito Corleone is easily one of my favorite characters of all time now. The death scenes are brutal and hard-hitting. The director didn't waste a single gunshot or strangulation for the sake of just doing it. There's a method to the madness of The Godfather, and I guess thats' why it hits people so hard. They story is built up in a way to where the killing of a character hits just as hard as your favorite character leaving the cast of your favorite sitcom.The scene in the garden with Don Vito and his grandson is by far my favorite. Out of all the ways I'd expect it to happen, It took me by surprise. It was a very sweet and heartfelt scene, and the character was too worthy of it. I would've been angry if Vito ended as a victim, and not the legend... the Godfather.Check this movie out. There's a good reason why it's such an important movie to the industry. Other than that - it's just a fantastic piece of cinema, and touches on a few topics we can all relate to: Honor, Nobility, and Family.",8,0,1,11 August 2009
