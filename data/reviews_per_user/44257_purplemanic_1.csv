Mission: Impossible III," mi3
","I really like the movie.it is better than the 2nd one. of course there was too much action,but it was OK.I think the first scene was so unnecessary.I did like P.S.Hoffman's performance.Tom was OK.I think it is good we did not know what rabbit's tail is.The views from Shangay and Italy were wonderful. I do not care about Tom's baby,his religion or his political opinion. I like his passion for making good movies.Are they good or not?It is controversial.But there is something about him that draws big audiences to movie theaters. There is one thing that I do not like about all MIs.It should be a team's work,but it is only Ethan's work. And there is one thing more;why does Tom run so much in his movies? I hope in his next movie,he stops running :)",7,5,9,3 May 2006
