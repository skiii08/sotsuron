10 Cloverfield Lane," Another example on how to mess up an ending
","It could have been a classic had it not been for that terrible ending. Everything was going well, the suspense between the characters, was the bunker man telling the truth? Everybody watching could not say, he looked like a man with serious psychological issues.
Now, what is this obsession with presenting aliens as some sort of prehistoric dinosaurs with a big nasty mouth eager to eat you? Does anyone think that a dinosaur like creature grinning their teeth would have the brain and the ability to build a space ship and travel through space? It's ridiculous!",5,1,2,17 August 2018
It," Disapointing
","The first 10 minutes were very promising, basically until the boy disappears down the drain. From then on the movie starts to lose gas. Too long, not scary, could easily do with 20 less minutes. It's watchable but this is not classic or scary.",5,0,0,18 October 2019
John Wick," A disaster from beginning to end
","The movie has two directors but the producers might have as well hired no one and save their wages. I am really sorry for Keanu, he's one of the coolest actors around and I can only imagine he was either misguided or did it for the pay check.
This movie is not better than the average low budget, low quality Steven Seagull run of the mill movie. Inverosimil script, bad direction, bad actors, bad soundtrack, bad everything.
Keanu looks like he's playing a video game from beginning to end shooting right left and centre killing dozens of guys. Even the soundtrack is more fitting of a video game.
So I'm very disappointed, I was expecting much better after all the publicity and promotion. The cinematic value of this movie is next to zero.",4,3,4,16 May 2020
Elysium," Where was the banner 'refugees welcome'?
","No need to say anything apart from the last scene where a horde of refugee like people rush to board the spaceships that will take them to Elysium no doubt to mess the whole place up and transform it into a rubbish tip in the sky.
And we are supposed to feel good about this ending? Well, not me.
If people on earth stopped breeding like rabbits maybe the world wouldn't be so overpopulated and have so many problems. The solution is not to scape to the last civilised place left to no doubt mess that place up as well.
Excellent special effects, very realistic but appalling political message.",5,0,1,3 March 2020
Munich," awful
","This movie is just about killing, killing in a rush, jumping from scene to scene, like the director is in a rush to show how this evil killer called avner manage to kill so many, the more the better. I was surprised to see the director was Spielberg. This must be without a doubt his worst movie. What is the point of this terrible movie? are we suppose to feel good and in the same side for this mercenaries who only know how to commit murder? Are we suppose to feel sympathy for this professional killers? Is this movie telling us that terrorism is OK only when it is perpetrated by the mosad? I would say this movie is about terrorists killing terrorists. There is no difference here between the mosad or their mercenaries and the palestiniam terrorists. Spielberg thought otherwise by the look of it. This film is highly offensive and disrespectful with the victims of terrorism worldwide.",1,6,12,9 August 2009
Gangs of New York," maybe the worst scorsese movie
","'gangs of new york' doesn't do any justice to scorsese'sreputation. It's a shame from the begining right to the ending. Don't get me wrong, it's ok by Hollywood standards but comingfrom what is suppose to be one of the best american directorsthese days  this movie only dissapoints. It's average, nothing outstanding about it. Another commercialmovie coming from Hollywood. Pity that Scorsese is responsiblefor this. 4 out of 10.",4,3,9,8 July 2003
