It," Way too much hype
","As far as remakes go... IT wasn't as bad as it could've been. It'll NEVER beat the original though.
PennyWise was as scary as ever. Overall the actors played their parts well.
I'm giving it a 7 because the makeup/CGI/Storyline was on point. The other 3 stars that would make it a 10/10 are reserved for the original!",7,0,2,4 November 2018
