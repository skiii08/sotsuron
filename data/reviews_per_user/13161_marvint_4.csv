The Rock," Entertaining if you can believe it...
","I'll start by saying that I enjoyed The Rock, but had a big problem with it in the area of suspension of disbelief.  There were too many contrived situations, characters whose actions didn't quite fit with situation or background, omissions and such.*** MILD SPOILER ALERT ***The idea that a general would be overcome by righteous indignation, and be driven to blackmailing the Government with a 'bluff' (his word) is a bit far-fetched.  But to think that this same General (who we find is indeed an honorable man) would actually poise the rockets at a city of millions of civilians is utterly unbelievable.The idea that Mason (Connery) would know all of the premises as well as he did, AND REMEMBER the tunnels where he spent three days 'in the dark' in such detail, is also beyond belief.The actions of Hummel's cohorts in the last few scenes is also unbelievable.Well, I could continue, but in summary the film could have been much better, had it not lacked so much fundamental credibility.But all in all, worth the $.99 rental cost...",7,1,1,15 May 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very good, but not a 10!
","After sitting through three hours of this movie, I must say that I left the theater a little disappointed. I definitely enjoyed it, but must say I had a few criticisms:1) It was much too dark (as in illumination, not w.r.t. mood),2) Many scenes were simply blurry: especially when the camera was moving in a crane shot, other times, too,3) The director couldn't decide if he was making a movie of the premiere classic fantasy books or a teenage horror flick: there were too many scenes where they just lulled the audience only to flash us with a fearful surprise (the woman next to me spent a great deal of the time jumping in fright).If you're contemplating seeing this movie -- definitely do, but don't expect a movie worthy of the ratings it's gotten here on IMDB.  It's very good, but not a 10 (more like an 8 or 8.5)!",1,3,10,20 December 2001
Cold Mountain," If only I'd known...
","I found this movie to be disturbing and difficult to watch. It seemed to relish in multiple, long sadistic scenes of tyrannical people torturing the innocent, and has an overwhelmingly depressing aura.But if you enjoy that sort of thing... maybe you'll like this.  I haven't read the book (my wife has) but despite her appreciation for the book: after seeing this, I'll skip the book too.Ruby (Zellweger) is excellent, Sally (Kathy Baker) is very good too, but it wasn't a movie I enjoyed, especially given the high expectations that I had.I gave it 4/10 stars.*SPOILER* Apparently that the ending in the book isn't as sad/depressing as it is in the movie.  Maybe just read the book & skip the movie?",4,0,1,27 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Only 200 minutes?
","I really enjoyed this movie -- well about 45 minutes of it.Unless you are a die-hard fanatic for the LOTR books (and maybe even then) you'll want to watch this with one finger on the fast forward button.Some scenes were excellent, but not enough when diluted by so much 'filler.' The special effects may have been masterful, but they didn't make it a great movie.  The movie simply takes itself far too seriously; how else could the director possibly justify being almost 3.5 hours long!?!Similarly to voters here -- this is rated as #3 in the top 250 of all time. That is *SO ASTOUNDINGLY OVERRATED* that I cannot understand it (this with 65,000+ votes).  It probably belongs in the top 1000, perhaps about #800. [How has the studio managed to create 45k+ IMDB accounts to skew the voting?]The basic flaw of the entire trilogy is that it's based on a long-winded, violently racists set of books.   Starting from that, you end up with.... well, you know.Truthfully, this is a 7/10 -- but it could have been a 7.5 if they'd actually done some editing down to ~1.5 hours.",1,3,21,22 June 2004
