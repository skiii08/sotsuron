Vertigo," a film for the ages
","It's not hard to see why Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' is considered one of the greatest films ever made. It is a beautifully textured and layered movie, mysterious and confusing, but in a good sense. It's a pity really that it has to come to an end and have it's many components 'explained;' the enjoyment one gets is from imagining all the possibilities conjured up in one's head while watching it. 'Vertigo' might be called an art film masquerading as mainstream entertainment, an apt if ironic description given its subject matter. The plot, to put it as simply as possible- a detective falls in love with a woman twice, the second time not realizing it is the same woman. She deceives him into thinking she is someone else, both times. A two-page synopsis of the various ins and outs of the story would do it no more justice. James Stewart plays the detective, Scottie Ferguson. I've always wondered why Hitchcock chose Stewart to play this role. Being the great actor he was, he does a fine job and is very convincing, but if I were to have read this script at the time and been asked to think of, say, fifty working actors to consider for the part, James Stewart would have come in fifty-first. There just is nothing in the actor's previous body of work to suggest he is right for the character in any way. The gangly, drawling, slow-talking, clearheaded, common-sensed Everyman made perfect sense for a movie like 'It's A Wonderful Life.' But to play an obsessed, neurotic, acrophobic, compulsive control freak who practically forces himself on a woman and insists she dress up like the presumed-dead, former object of his affections... Jimmy Stewart? You've got to be joking. And yet somehow it works. Kim Novak as the woman is easier to figure out. She was the latest in a series of icy blondes just waiting to be unfrozen in Hitchcock films; this was a continuing theme in his movies that would continue long past 'Vertigo.' Novak captures the strange Madeleine and more common Judy very well; it is quite believable that the second character is, at first, intended to be a completely different woman. Much of the magic of 'Vertigo' comes from not only wondering what will happen next, but pondering what has just happened, and what it means. Rational explanations become less and less interesting. This is what I meant about the ending- outside of a supernatural one, there's almost no way a movie like 'Vertigo' can have a completely satisfactory outcome. One certainly has to give Hitchcock credit for coming as close as possible. He was not one for the paranormal anyway (I suppose 'The Birds' comes closest); his flights of fantasy have more to do with human motivations and the bizarre, sometimes insane workings of the mind. 'Vertigo' takes this approach, and in the characters of Scottie and Madeleine/Judy, shows the most extreme manifestations of desire, submission, and delusion.",10,5,6,31 March 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," still a lot of fun, but...
","I understand that I may be forgiven for not thinking 'Citizen Kane' is so great, but the following is cinematic heresy- I've decided I'm not that crazy about the Indiana Jones series. They're fun films, no doubt, and there are certainly worse ways to spend a couple of hours. I watched 'The Last Crusade' again not long ago, and last night I watched the first one. At the risk of stating the obvious, what 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' really has going for it is Harrison Ford and a couple of slam-bang action/special effects sequences. Well, you say, for cryin' out loud, isn't that enough? And yeah, I suppose it is. I've just found I'm not nearly as enamored of the series as I once thought I was, and each of the films has flaws that perhaps only become apparent on repeated viewings. The aspect of 'Raiders' that grates particularly each time I see it is Karen Allen's performance. I'm sorry, I don't find her funny or attractive or even interesting. I understand that the idea is for her to be a feisty tomboy, someone who speaks her mind and is 'more than a match' (as they say) for Ford's Indy. But does that mean Allen's Marion has to be so utterly unattractive, in every sense? At times, she seems more like a gangly, socially-challenged thirteen-year-old who hasn't learned basic table manners yet and who snorts when she laughs. I don't know what's more annoying, her behavior or the fact that every male in the film seems to think she's gorgeous. Granted, she doesn't have any competition... that must be it. So there's that. The film of course was a trendsetter in many ways, resurrecting almost single-handedly the grand old adventure flick. The durable plot elements and (other) characters were made to seem fresh again, from the resourceful adventurer venturing to exotic lands to those most reliably evil of slimy villains, the Nazis. And there is a toughness to the first Indiana Jones movie that seems somewhat lacking in the other two. Both Sallah and Marcus Brody are real characters here, alternately serious and amusing. By the time we get to 'Last Crusade,' the two men are strictly comic relief, and Marcus in particular becomes a scatterbrained buffoon. The climax of 'Raiders,' when it finally comes, was something of a revelation (so to speak) at the time. This was the big payoff, and it didn't disappoint, though it's actually pretty brief. The face-melting and vaporous spirits (to be used to a much greater extent later in Spielberg's 'Poltergeist') had audiences wide-eyed with amazement. And then a clever little epilogue left cinema-goers feeling satisfied, that they'd really gotten their money's worth. I shared all those feelings when I first saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark;' as I said, it's only been the last two or three times I've watched it that I haven't been as blown away.",7,15,23,14 May 2008
United 93," sad, uplifting, and necessary
","'United 93' depicts the events of 9/11 from three perspectives: the passengers, the air traffic controllers, and the terrorists themselves. It is a muted film, low-key even while being almost unbearably tense at times. What it puts across most effectively is the confusion of the day, something I think most people tend to forget in retrospect. We now know of course what happened, when it happened, who did it, but on that awful day, facts were few and speculation was rampant. Everyone has a 9/11 story to tell, just as people of earlier generations could tell you where they were when JFK was shot, or when they heard about the Pearl Harbor attack. I do remember the confusion, being at work and listening to radio news reports... at one point, it was reported that a dozen planes were still in the air and it was strongly suspected that they had all been hijacked as well. This is the tack that 'United 93' takes, how slowly it seems before anyone in authority grasps what has happened and what continued to happen. There's no real sense of finger-pointing; everyone seems to have had a mental block against imagining that what took place was even possible. As one of the air traffic supervisors points out early on, it had been years since a single plane had been hijacked so even that was almost unthinkable, much less four planes being taken over at once to be used as weapons. It was quite clearly unfathomable to the politicians, the military, civilian authorities, and the general public. The passengers of 'United 93' are nameless faces, an assortment of 'types' it seems and their relative anonymity is intended by the filmmakers. They are people we see whenever we go to the airport or get on a plane, people we will only be aware of in passing and then never see again. And they are us. In keeping with the real-life, documentary feel of the film, the climactic scene doesn't feel like a climax, it feels like a group of people deciding on the spur of the moment to do something, anything rather than sit there helpless. They know from their cellphone conversations about the other planes hitting the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. They have reasoned that the hijackers are extremely unlikely to be carrying explosives or even real weapons. They know they outnumber the terrorists. One male passenger says he can probably fly the plane. So the decision is made to rush the cockpit, overpower their captors, and take control of the plane. It is a decision borne of necessity, and of elimination... it is the best option available to them. So there is a rush forward from the back of the cabin, a struggle with the two terrorists outside the cockpit which results in one being killed and the other knocked unconscious. The hijacker piloting the plane hears the passengers trying to break the door in and begins diving and swerving, trying to knock them off-balance. The final shots show the passengers breaking into the cockpit, as we see through the cockpit windows the ground rushing up. Then the screen goes black. At that point, in the theater where I was watching 'United 93,' you could have heard a pin drop.",9,5,8,4 June 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," you probably like this movie more than me
","Some of the movies I've written about I've never seen before (like a lot of the Hitchcocks); others I've watched so many times I almost have them committed to memory. Then there are those I have recently revisited, sometimes for the first time since their initial release. Into this category falls 'E.T.'- The Extra-Terrestrial.' People might remember that 'E.T.' and 'Poltergeist' were released almost simultaneously back in '82. 'Poltergeist' I've watched probably twenty times since. 'E.T' I had seen... once. That probably tells you something. I was definitely not as enamored with the film as it seemed the rest of the earth's population was. I thought it was a cute flick, nothing more or less. So when I sat down to watch it again after twenty-six years, I wondered if my feelings would have changed. The first thing that struck me was how little I remembered about the film, the details anyway. But when it was all said and done, I would say my appraisal now is about what it was then... maybe a little higher. I think Spielberg's approach to films like this is one that you either embrace and enjoy almost giddily, or it kind of gets on your nerves. I must be in the latter group. I can certainly understand its appeal, particularly to kids, but not limited to them. Spielberg has a concept of the modern suburban family that he has explored many times, and speaking of 'Poltergeist', it shares many of those ideas and feelings with 'E.T.', right down to similar dialogue, humor, even the family dog. The kids can be naughty, but not juvenile delinquent naughty; they're just off in their own little worlds, they don't listen and the parents don't seem to mind much. Kids break a lamp? Parents just stand there smiling and shaking their heads- those darn kids, what WILL they do next? The families tend to be dysfunctional, but in such a happy, loving, caring kind of way, what kind of ogre would criticize them? There is a moment in the climax of 'Poltergeist' that is very telling; the parents are asked who punishes the kids, and neither one knows the answer. Obviously because they never do. Anyway, 'E.T.' presents the prototypical such family (no Dad present, but hey, no biggie) and you wonder how the Mom (Dee Wallace) not only keeps her cheery disposition but her sanity with this group of kids. When E.T. himself waddles onto the scene, Mom is so oblivious to her surroundings that she doesn't know he's there, even when he walks past her three or four times. Henry Thomas was a great choice to play the boy, Elliott, who finds and befriends E.T. The movie is really seen through his eyes as much as E.T.'s, and the idea of a symbiotic relationship developing between them is the great central idea of the film, just as the one great scene is the one where E.T.'s feelings, including getting tipsy, are transmitted to Elliott while he's in school. There are other good parts scattered here and there throughout the movie, notably the bits featuring a very young Drew Barrymore, who is the very epitome of 'cute.' (Interesting too, that she was the only one to have a successful film career afterward.) But then that's 'E.T.'s problem, or its salvation, depending on your point of view- it's just too damn cute.",6,0,2,7 June 2008
Chinatown," who to believe?
","'Chinatown' is a rare achievement- it manages to update a classic 1940's film genre without ruining it, in this case the hardboiled private investigator/film noir genre. Not only does it not ruin it or turn it into a big in-joke for cinema buffs, 'Chinatown' actually expands on the formula to include elements that would not have been possible or acceptable in that earlier time. The basic plot does not sound all that enticing (private eye investigates water usage scandal) but that is really just the jumping off mark for a number of strange subplots, each one more bizarre than the previous. In best film noir fashion, characters are not who they seem to be, major plot points shrink in significance while seemingly minor ones prove vitally important. The man trying to unravel the whole caper, as they say, is Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private dick who usually specializes in smaller and more mundane cases, like marital infidelity. Before he knows it, Gittes is in over his head but he doesn't like being played for the fool, so he determines to find the truth no matter where it leads. What director Roman Polanski and writer Robert Towne end up with is a sort of revved-up, R-rated '70's combination of 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'The Big Sleep.' They keep all the conventions (the requisite opening scene where a mysterious woman shows up and hires the p.i., etc.) then elaborate on them and ultimately create some new ones. It's all great fun to watch and confusing as hell at times. John Huston plays Noah Cross, a wealthy monster of a man, whose evil isn't completely apparent till late in the film. Faye Dunaway is the femme fatale, Evelyn Mulwray, who hardly ever gives Gittes a truthful answer about anything (think Mary Astor in 'Maltese Falcon'). Towne's script is full of great dialogue and intriguing situations. Famously, he and Polanski feuded over the ending; Towne wanted a satisfactory resolution, Polanski, a downbeat one. The director won out. I don't think a 'happy ending' would have ruined the film, but the conclusion they used is certainly unforgettable. And now, of course, it's almost impossible to imagine 'Chinatown' ending any other way.",8,0,1,1 February 2008
The Big Lebowski," enjoyable stoner comedy
","'The Big Lebowski' was supposedly inspired by the old Humphrey Bogart classic, 'The Big Sleep,' but I don't see it, unless every movie ever made with a convoluted plot is to be considered a descendant of it. What it reminds me of is Martin Scorsese's 'After Hours,' with which it has much more in common. Specifically, the story of an inconsequential character who gets caught up in a byzantine series of situations; the other main feature of such a story is that seemingly anything bad that can happen to the character, does. 'After Hours' though was better, and funnier. I think what 'The Big Lebowski' lacks is the frenetic pace of 'After Hours.' This film just sort of ambles along, amiable and occasionally very funny. Like most Coen Brothers' movies, it is determinedly odd in a lot of ways, but so many films these days are, that quality doesn't come across as terribly unique, or even original. Jeff Bridges is the perfect choice to play Jeff Lebowski, aka 'Dude.' The very definition of the term 'slacker,' Dude doesn't have much of a life beyond bowling, smoking pot, and drinking White Russians. He has two close friends, Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi), and their socializing appears limited to bowling tournaments. But Bridges invests Dude with a sly kind of laidback style; he comes across as a very likable ne'er-do-well, somebody you wouldn't mind spending a few hours with at the corner bar (or bowling alley). Goodman's Walter is a hyper Vietnam Vet who lacks common sense to an astonishing degree and is completely oblivious to that fact; Buscemi's character Donny seems to exist for the sole purpose of being told to shut up, usually by Walter. The film enjoys being weird and bucking convention here and there. A sort of running gag is that whenever Dude is knocked unconscious (and yes, it happens more than once), we enter a dream sequence. The best one is an elaborately staged dance number set to the '60s hit, 'I Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In.' Julianne Moore plays an avant-garde artist with a (surprise) strange outlook on art, sex, and life in general. She's pretty good too. But some of the other oddball supporting characters, like the three Nihilists, are more like something you'd see in a VERY average 'Saturday Night Live' sketch. 'The Big Lebowski' has its own semi-quirky, meandering kind of charm and Coen aficionados will probably enjoy it more than the average moviegoer. Its main appeal, to me anyway, is Bridges' performance. He really inhabits the character of Dude and it's a lot of fun listening to him deliver the droll stoner dialogue throughout. That alone makes the film worth checking out.",6,7,14,15 July 2008
Star Trek," WAY better than I expected or hoped for
","Some hardcore Trekkies are not happy with the new movie, 'Star Trek.' But unless you're one of those who is immersed in the minutiae of the Trek 'canon' (as purists call it), chances are you'll find it exciting and involving. I am myself a long-time fan and I found it very faithful to the original series, admittedly in spirit more than every tiny detail. In any event, the makers of the new 'Star Trek' have given themselves a free pass by utilizing a time travel story which in effect creates an alternate universe and history of sorts, so that things aren't exactly as they once were anyway. But the characters are as we remember them, brought to life in greater detail than the original series allowed. Kirk in particular is fleshed out, made believable and three-dimensional as never before. A two-fisted hellraiser as a youth, he basically joins Star Fleet on a dare and continues to fly by the seat of his pants, fighting authority while at the same time becoming a leader. Spock is his opposite, and here he is portrayed as even more aloof and tortured than Leonard Nimoy's interpretation. He has quite a temper and does not suffer fools gladly... and at first he considers Kirk a major fool. At one point, while briefly Kirk's superior officer, Spock has Kirk thrown off the ship, literally. The two have many great encounters during the movie, arguments, discussions, fights and finally collaboration. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are fine as Kirk and Spock, respectively. Despite early press stories which indicated the actors would not imitate their predecessors in the various roles, that is exactly what appears to be happening. Certainly Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy seems to be channeling DeForest Kelley. And how else to explain Anton Yelchin's insanely absurd Russian accent as Pavel Chekov? All of the regular cast are 'copying,' to one extent or another, their counterparts in the original cast. And the great thing is, it works. Eric Bana as Nero is a serviceable villain, a crazed Romulan out for revenge against the future Spock (Leonard Nimoy in a good featured role thankfully, instead of a throwaway cameo) and then the entire Federation. The somewhat standard-issue plot is helped by a few surprises that might not sink in until after viewing the whole film. And Bruce Greenwood is excellent as Christopher Pike, first captain of the Enterprise. It would have been tempting to make him a cardboard character, someone to cast aside to make room for Kirk, but he's not- he's wise, resourceful, and committed, which makes him the perfect mentor for Kirk. Others worth noting include Simon Pegg, in a too-brief appearance as Scotty. He makes the most of his screen-time and has some of the funniest and most perfectly-timed lines of dialogue. Zoe Saldana makes a sultry Uhura, who apparently has the hots for Spock. Something tells me this will come up again in the inevitable sequel. The opening sequence, where Kirk is born during a vicious attack on his father's starship, has to rank as one of the most exciting scenes in all of Star Trek history, which as we all know, covers a lot of territory. And that's just the beginning. This year's 'Star Trek' is not only a strong candidate for best 'Trek' ever, it's also the best movie of the year, so far.",9,2,10,21 May 2009
The Girl Next Door," pretty cheesy teen sex flick
","'Risky Business' may develop a reputation like that of 'Easy Rider'- a good film that people come to wish had never been made because of all the cheesy imitations it spawned. Exhibit 273- 'The Girl Next Door,' yet another adolescent sex fantasy masquerading as a 'coming of age' film or something similarly high-minded. What are the ingredients? First, a teenage boy's wet dream come true, a drop-dead beautiful girl who takes an interest in him for no apparent good reason. In this case, she's an ex-porn star who moves in next door. Uh huh. Mix in the usual group of geeks, nerds, bullies and situations requiring a prurient spin on almost everything, the requisite wild parties and car rides, the late night dips in someone else's swimming pool and sexual escapades at the senior prom... you know the drill. 'The Girl Next Door' has a few ideas of its own, but not many good ones. The film thinks that by quickly disowning what are essentially soft-core porn scenes and suggestions by having one character or another disapprove of them, it's perfectly justified in showing them in the first place. This is the equivalent of showing a bunch of teenagers a skin flick and then saying, 'that's what you shouldn't do.' As though that's the lesson they'll draw from it. Elisha Cuthbert plays the title character, Danielle; in appearance, she's sort of a cross between Debbie Harry and Cameron Diaz. Emile Hirsch is the teenager in question. They both give likable enough performances, considering the circumstances, but they are dragged through teen-flick cliché after teen-flick cliché. The initial attraction, the misunderstanding, the falling out... the scenes where she tells him to just leave her alone, the reconciliation. Strictly paint-by-the-numbers stuff. And actually, while Cuthbert is on screen a lot, she doesn't have much to do in the second half. At least it seems that way. Maybe she just doesn't have anything interesting to do. The less said about the supporting players, the better, except one character type I am REALLY getting tired of, and that's the wise-ass best friend who acts as though he knows the ways of the world and is always offering inane advice. If nothing else, it all makes you realize how well-made a film 'Risky Business' was. But that movie had a real script, and two real actors- Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay. There was a fair amount of titillation in 'Risky Business' too. I would say the distinction between it and what we see in 'The Girl Next Door' is fairly obvious. To be fair, 'The Girl Next Door' isn't the worst of these kind of flicks. There are some funny bits here and there; Timothy Olyphant as a Fonzie-ish porn producer almost succeeds in making his a real character, and has some funny lines. But to say this film doesn't quite rank with the dregs of teen sex comedies is definitely damning it with faint praise.",4,0,2,5 July 2008
Spider-Man 2," great superhero flick, but...
","One of the great misconceptions about the appeal of superheroes, and one that is constantly put forward even by well-meaning individuals connected with them (just watch the behind-the-scenes interviews on the Spider-Man DVD's)is that the audience is REALLY rooting for and relating to their alter-egos, the Clark Kents and the Bruce Waynes. Or in this case, Peter Parker. The logic behind this argument is that we can all identify with the poor schmucks who have trouble at work or school, or have all kinds of problems with the opposite sex, etc. Fair enough. But I dare anyone to make a movie about a Peter Parker who WASN'T Spider-Man. Just a nerdy kid who has trouble paying his rent and daydreams a lot in school. There's a film that would gross $300 million. Yeah, right. Nope, sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but the only reason film audiences give a damn about Peter Parker is because he IS Spider-Man. That is the appeal. We don't go to the movies to see ordinary people who are bored with their jobs and short on money; most of us live that every day. (To go off on a tangent- is anyone really surprised that all the films about the Iraq War bombed? Same thing. How many wives said to their husbands, 'Honey, let's go see that new movie about the Iraq War?' Not too many, apparently.) No, and this should be a no-brainer: the appeal of a superhero movie is the superhero. That's what both the kids and adults go to see. Which brings up another dichotomy- the actors who play them are inevitably cast to be believable as the alter ego, not the superhero. (The only reason Michael Keaton was convincing as Batman was that when he put on that muscle-rippling bat-suit, he ceased being Michael Keaton.) Unfortunately, Tobey Maguire never stops being Tobey Maguire, even when he's Spider-Man. There is a scene late in the movie when Spider-Man is angry about Mary Jane being kidnapped; he rips off the chains that bind him and we are ready for a great roar of fury, but no, all that we hear is that whining, Mickey Mouse/Peter Parker voice pleading with Harry Osborn to help. And yet, this is something that is not immediately noticeable and Spider-Man 2 is certainly one of the best superhero films ever made, with enough great action scenes and wonderful special effects to make up for the dead spots. And was there ever a more fully realized super-villain than Alfred Molina's Dr. Octopus? Costumes, computer graphics, and model work are melded seamlessly with Molina's inspired performance to make a truly unforgettable screen character. It's fair to say that the presence of Doc Ock is what pushes Spider-Man 2 over the top into something much more than a comic book flick. J.K. Simmons is a joy to watch as always as the blustery J. Jonah Jameson. Kirsten Dunst remains a very fetching Mary Jane Watson, the quintessential girl-next-door who it's impossible not to fall in love with. But the director, Sam Raimi, loves to focus on down-on-his-luck Peter Parker and it frankly becomes depressing, almost morbidly so at times. Someone should tell him that a minute and a half of happiness at the end of the film doesn't make up for two hours of Peter Parker being yelled at, dumped by his girlfriend, hit on the head, and in general endlessly humiliated by everyone from his landlord to his supposed 'best friend.' It's actually a relief to see Dr. Octopus come along and taunt Spider-Man; at least Spider-Man fights back. Peter Parker is just a hopeless wimp. I know... maybe that's the point, but Raimi's approach is overkill to me. So a mixed bag, but between Molina's menacing portrayal and the slam-bang action sequences and effects, there's plenty to enjoy here.",8,3,4,27 November 2007
That Thing You Do!," 1964 once more
","Tom Hanks' writing and directorial debut, 'That Thing You Do!', will probably not go down in history as a classic along the lines of 'Forrest Gump' or 'Saving Private Ryan,' but I find it one of those movies I love to revisit every six months or so. It has an easy-going charm about it, low-key and yet wonderfully evocative of the period it presents, that magical year of 1964, after the Beatles had arrived and changed music forever, and every teenage kid wanted to start his own rock band. 'That Thing You Do!' was a modest success at the box-office, and the critics were generally kind to Hanks' first try at directing. Just below the surface, though, one could tell people were surprised and in some cases disappointed that his initial effort wasn't somehow more substantial, or biting, or something. I take it these people were someplace else in 1964. In the film, Jimmy (Jonathan Schaech) is the one who starts the band, the one with big dreams and a fair amount of talent. The other three band members are pretty much along for the ride, wherever it leads them, and if it doesn't lead anywhere, that's okay... they weren't doing anything anyway. Lenny (Steve Zahn) is the goofy lead guitarist; there's the unnamed bass player (Ethan Embry) who's even goofier (listed in the credits as T.B. Player; clever how they go through the whole movie without calling him by name); and the drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott), who is a last-minute replacement for their regular drummer after he falls off a parking meter and breaks his arm. Guy is in his own way just as much a music buff as Jimmy, but his love is jazz. He doesn't much care for the pop/rock the group (newly dubbed the Oneders, hopefully pronounced Wonders) but he enjoys their taste of success and playing for the enthusiastic crowds that grow larger as the film progresses. Guy's not the leader or control freak that Jimmy is; he emerges though as the heart of the band and is, ironically, the last one left standing at the end of it all. Also along for the ride is Faye (Liv Tyler), Jimmy's girlfriend and the Oneders' number one fan. In an early role, Charlize Theron plays Tina, Guy's girlfriend (if only briefly). If only her part was as memorable as her looks. The band makes a record of Jimmy's song 'That Thing You Do!', and after it gets some radio play in their hometown, they are noticed by Mr. White (Tom Hanks), an exec at Playtone Records who becomes their manager. One of his first decisions is to change the name of the band to the Wonders. People kept calling them 'the Oh-need-ers' and it was getting confusing. From there, the film takes us on a predictable but very enjoyable ride as the song climbs the charts and the Wonders grow in popularity, playing to larger and larger crowds, finally culminating in them appearing on a big network variety show. The song, by the way, is a great little tune, very Beatle-ish, and almost criminally catchy. I don't know how many times it's played in the film, in part or in whole (I would guess about a dozen) and it changes subtly over the course of the movie, bits added for extended versions... in any event, it will be buzzing around in your head for at least a week or so after seeing the film. In what has in reality been the case more times than most people realize, the Wonders break up just as 'That Thing You Do!' peaks at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jimmy quits in a fit of pique, his artistic vanity wounded when White tells him he only gets to write two songs per album. Lenny marries a blonde secretary in Las Vegas. The bass player joins the Marines. That leaves Guy to face Mr. White alone, who tells him the Wonders are in breach of contract, but it's no big deal. Happens all the time, White says... to one-hit wonders.",7,1,1,4 February 2008
Ed Wood," brilliant biopic
","Anyone familiar with Ed Wood's story, and I think that takes in most movie buffs, will be nodding his or her head in knowing amusement several times during 'Ed Wood.' It is the masterfully told tale of the legendarily not-so-masterful director of the same name. In fact, that may be its biggest transgression: it's too well made to fit the subject. Be that as it may, Tim Burton has crafted a loving but unsparing look at Ed Wood and friends. Wood himself is overshadowed at times by Martin Landau's uncanny portrayal of Bela Lugosi, which not only won an Oscar but is quite simply one of the greatest performances by any actor in any movie, period. It is at once sad, funny, poignant and even poetic. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, and while he doesn't really look like him, he certainly conveys Wood's boundless enthusiasm for film-making convincingly. He also invests the character with Wood's small-town naiveté, and makes his cross-dressing seem almost, well, normal. It makes sense to Ed Wood anyway. The film succeeds on many levels, for instance in its depiction of how low-budget movies were made in the 1950's. Any student of the cinema will find that part of the film fascinating. Burton wisely shot 'Ed Wood' in high-contrast black and white (the only way to go for this material) and his recreations of Wood's movies are very convincing, even when they are matched with the actual original footage. It's a shame 'Ed Wood' was such a flop at the box office though it is understandable as well. Audiences for the most part had no idea what it was about, and were not inclined to see a movie about the worst director of all time. Sometimes original or unique stories are simply proclaimed 'wrong' by mainstream film-goers and that is the fate that met 'Ed Wood' in its initial release, though critics loved it. This is a film that bears repeated viewings, as there's something new to be seen every time and a host of wonderful performances by everyone involved. I think even Ed Wood would have loved 'Ed Wood.'",10,3,3,1 December 2007
Insomnia," excellent crime thriller
","'Insomnia' is a tense murder mystery where the mystery isn't who killed whom, but rather who will find out and who will pay. Al Pacino plays LA police detective Will Dormer, admired for a long career in which he's solved many a murder case. He and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to a remote Alaskan town to help find a teenage girl's killer. Dormer lives up to his hype, showing the local cops a thing or two about running an investigation, and very soon sets a trap for the killer, which works. But then, in an exciting scene set in a thick Alaskan fog, Dormer accidentally shoots and kills his partner, moments after the murder suspect has shot one of the local cops. In the confusion, it is just assumed the suspect shot both men, and Dormer does not admit his guilt. The girl's murderer, Walter Finch (Robin Williams) knows the truth however, and he escapes into the fog only to resurface later when he will blackmail Dormer. Though many elements in 'Insomnia' have popped up before, the stylish presentation and intelligent dialogue employed here make them seem fresh. The killer's taunting of the law enforcement agent pursuing him is reminiscent in some ways of 'In the Line of Fire', and the byplay between Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. Except here it's better. Pacino's Dormer gives as good as he gets. He's not easily intimidated, even though Finch can ruin his career, even put him in prison with what he knows. There is also the added intriguing factor of the 'midnight sun,' meaning it never gets dark, which affects Dormer in particular. He can't sleep, and after a few days begins to suffer from sleep deprivation. This only adds to the plot's tension, as we wonder how long he can hold himself together. The other main character is Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), a fresh-faced, earnest Alaskan cop who is an ardent admirer of Dormer. She even wrote a thesis while at the police academy based on one of his famous cases. Her role is pivotal, especially at the end, when she discovers the truth about him. Robin Williams plays the murderer in a low-key, conversational way that is quite convincing. The scenes with him and Pacino are some of the best in 'Insomnia,' with each man trying to trip up the other, until an explosive final confrontation in which there is no more bargaining; someone has to lose. 'Insomnia' is a powerful thriller that pulls no punches, and it contains yet another bravura performance by Al Pacino.",9,0,0,30 January 2009
Alien," an incredible film
","I've lost track of how many times I've seen 'Alien.' Let's just say, a bunch. I never saw it in the theater, which I suppose is my one big regret in life. The first time I watched it was from a bootleg video print someone loaned me not long after the film came out. I remember standing in one spot in front of the TV, not moving for two hours until it was over. I didn't even realize I was standing the whole time. So yes, this is one of my all-time favorite movies, definitely in my personal top ten. Have the repeated viewings over the years diminished its appeal to me? Only slightly, if at all. I STILL see things in 'Alien' when I watch it now that I've never noticed before. This is Ridley Scott's masterwork and try as they might, none of the film's imitators have managed to duplicate its aura of silent menace and genuinely disturbing creepiness. While 'Alien' draws its inspiration from several earlier films and books, the way it merges them all together seems completely original. H.R. Giger's bizarre painting are of course a crucial component. The alien itself is wet, slimy, feral; it's as though the crew is trapped with an insane, rabid, murderous animal that they never get a good look at (and neither do we, until the very end.) Everything about it ties into our worst primal fears; of suffocating, of having something grow inside us, of being ripped apart, literally. All of this works beautifully in juxtaposition with the crew of the infected ship. They are not explorers, they are workers, as ordinary as any group you might find toiling at an industrial plant or oil refinery. They are tough in a weathered sort of way but not heroic in the typical sense. Through no fault of their own, the group never really understands what they're up against. To them, the common thought seems to be, 'this thing can't be THAT hard to get rid of,' a defensive kind of self-delusion to stave off the increasing sense of fear and desperation as their number dwindles one by one. The characters all come across as very human, each with strong and weak points, and it's almost a game the audience plays trying to figure out which one he or she would behave like in such circumstances. Would you be stoic, like Dallas? Angry, like Parker? Scared witless, like Lambert? Or would you have the wherewithal to hold up till the end and somehow kill the alien, like Ripley? One can't help but get sucked into 'Alien' that way; it gets inside you and stays with you, long after the final images have faded from the screen.",10,1,3,11 November 2008
Lost in Translation," offbeat, amusing and melancholy
","'Lost in Translation' would be a good movie to watch at a nearly empty matinée on a rainy weekday afternoon when you're feeling sorry for yourself. The reason being, you'll be able to relate to the two main characters, Bob and Charlotte, as that's what they spend a lot of time doing. The good news is, the movie doesn't wallow in self-pity, but rather uses a measure of it as a jumping off point for a relationship to form between them. This happens against the backdrop of Tokyo... but more on that in a moment. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a somewhat over-the-hill movie star in Japan to film a whiskey commercial. People instinctively like him, because of his celebrity and the fact that he is charming and funny (when he wants to be). Most of the time, though, he is quiet and keeps to himself outside of public appearances. At first, Bob is anxious to finish the job and return home. Then he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) in the hotel bar and they gradually begin talking. They are both married, neither very happily, and they find in each other a playmate of sorts to pass the time with while stuck in Japan. Charlotte, who is much younger, is there with her husband, a photographer, who seems to find any excuse to go off without her. So she and Bob start finding things to do together, in a casual, unforced way. But they don't have an affair, in the romantic/sexual sense. Though it's never spoken, one can almost hear each of them thinking that they're not going to do something rash or stupid just because they're bored. It's also clear that there's a strong attraction between them, beyond just palling around together; each begins to feel the other is a kindred spirit and there is teasing and flirting, such as when they go to a karaoke party at a Japanese friend's apartment. But there is almost a palpable sense of relief in that neither feels obligated to pressure or be pressured by the other to have sex. All this goes on in the context of two people in Tokyo, strangers in a strange land, you might say. And the residents of that city are portrayed in a way that does indeed make them appear very odd. They seem almost like an alien race who have been brainwashed/corrupted by American and western culture. The Japanese have their own traditions, of course, and those are touched on. The American influence though is everywhere, distorted, as though drawn through a Japanese filter so that what emerges is familiar but warped, like the insane TV show Bob agrees to be interviewed on. I don't suppose any of this is particularly new, yet it makes quite a bizarre impression as presented in 'Lost in Translation,' and even the film's title is perhaps a comment on the dichotomies between Japanese and American society. Towards the end of the film, Bob has a one-night stand with a nightclub singer and Charlotte is angry about it. She isn't even sure why but she is. They go to lunch and there is a funny, snipy exchange-Charlotte- 'Well, she is closer to your age. You could talk about things you have in common, like, um, growing up in the '50's. Maybe she liked the movies you were making in the '70's, when you were still making movies.' Bob- 'Wasn't there anyone else there to lavish you with attention?'The movie's ending drew some criticism but it seemed perfect to me. On his way to the airport, Bob sees Charlotte walking down a crowded sidewalk, and he runs over to her; they embrace and he whispers something to her which we can't hear. Then they separate and he heads on to the airport. His expression makes clear to me that Bob is happier having spoken to her and has resolved to do something. You are left to your own conclusion but my impression is that they have agreed to meet back in the States. It's nice to think so, anyway. Bill Murray is essentially still playing Bill Murray in 'Lost in Translation,' but a muted, melancholy, toned-down version that is right for the film. And Scarlett Johansson is believable and fetching in a role that requires her to react to his long silent stares and she does so in a warm and credible manner. In fact, my main criticism of the movie is that there are TOO many of Murray's 'long silent stares.' You want to reach into the screen, shake him and yell, 'Say something!' But that said, 'Lost in Translation' manages to be sad, funny, and even a little uplifting when it's all said and done... depending on what you make of that ending.",7,0,0,2 July 2008
The Godfather: Part II," the saga continues
","The first 'Godfather' film was a beautifully rendered, violent and at times even warmhearted look inside a Mafia crime family. It deserved all the accolades it received for direction, cinematography, art direction and of course those wonderful performances by Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall and the rest of the cast. I think it's fair to say no one expected the sequel to outshine the original, but to many peoples' minds, somehow it did. It is even more intricate and expansive, presenting two stories at great length, one taking place before the first film and the other, continuing the first's narrative. 'The Godfather Part II' has been called both the greatest sequel of all time and the greatest American film, period. It was nominated for 11 Oscars. The 'sequel' part of the film concerns Michael Corleone's attempts to hold his family and its 'business' together after the death of Vito Corleone. Times are changing and he sees an opportunity to invest in Havana's casinos with the help of Hyman Roth, a former associate of his father's, and the pre-Castro, pro-business government in Cuba. The plot of 'Part II' is difficult to follow at times; there are double-crosses, and perceived double-crosses that really aren't, and it's hard to know who is sincere about what. The only thing that is certain is that everyone looks after their own interests and there is no hesitation in using murder as a final negotiating tool. Killings and attempted killings continue, but in this film, they are more methodical and cold-blooded. Toward the end, Tom Hagen even asks Michael Corleone if he feels the need to kill everyone. No, Michael says, just our enemies. But when one of those 'enemies' turns out to be his own brother, Fredo, it is clear that things have changed in the Corleone family, and not for the better. Francis Ford Coppola spoke of the inevitable decline in the Corleone family and it is very apparent, never more so than when Michael gives the order to have Fredo murdered. The 'prequel' segments are, by contrast, very simple and tell the story of how Vito Corleone arrived in America and began to build his empire. Robert DeNiro does not so much replace Marlon Brando as offer an interpretation of Corleone as a young man. There is wonderful period detail in these scenes; the tenement neighborhoods of the recently arrived Italians, living in their own section of New York, bits of broken English beginning to find their way into the mother tongue. It's all filmed in sepia-tinted color, which creates the feeling of a time passed, like looking at old photographs. Unlike the 1950's plot, the turn-of-the-century story is fairly cut-and-dried. Vito Corleone marries, starts a family, and begins a loose partnership with other young immigrants in what will eventually become the Corleone crime family. He kills the neighborhood crime boss, the one who collected protection money from all the local businesses, and effectively replaces him and the old way, becoming a more benevolent, friendlier version of the Black Hand, if no less lethal when the need arises. He even finds time to travel back to Sicily and visit revenge on the aged crime lord there who had murdered members of his family. 'The Godfather Part II' is filled with memorable performances, all of the continuing characters portrayed by the same actors as the first film. It is an epic undertaking and rewards repeated viewings with new detail unnoticed previously, not to mention better understanding of the labyrinth plot intrigues. It is also ultimately depressing, in a way the first movie wasn't. In spite of everything, the audience was pulling for the Corleone family to succeed and win out over its enemies in 'The Godfather;' I don't think that's the case at the end of 'The Godfather Part II.'",9,1,2,5 January 2008
North by Northwest," tremendously entertaining
","I'm something of a latecomer to the films of Alfred Hitchcock. For some inexplicable reason, I had it in my head for years that I wouldn't enjoy most of his work. Even sillier is the fact that the two Hitchcock films I HAD seen, 'Psycho' and 'The Birds,' were two of my favorite movies ever. Go figure. A few years ago, I rented two of his lesser offerings, 'Rope' and 'Marnie,' which seemed to confirm my suspicions. (Loved the giant backdrop of the battleship at the end of 'Marnie,' though.) Then this year, I have watched three bona fide Hitchcock classics- 'Rear Window,' 'Vertigo,' (both commented on elsewhere) and last night, 'North by Northwest.' Need I even point out that I am now a full-fledged Hitchcock devotee and am really looking forward to seeing the rest of his catalogue. As with 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window,' I had no preconceptions about 'North by Northwest' and it, like those other two, took me very much by surprise. It is an almost perfect blend of thriller and comedy, neither aspect overwhelming the other. In fact, they compliment each other beautifully. A favorite Hitchcockian theme is the misunderstood main character, in this case Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill (the 'O' doesn't stand for anything), and there has probably never been a more misunderstood character in the Hitchcock canon, maybe in all of cinema. Through the most casual mistake imaginable, a group of foreign spies come to believe Thornhill is actually George Kaplan, an American secret agent on their tail. Naturally, Thornhill's protestations to them (after they abduct him) that he is not Kaplan only serve to reinforce their conviction that he is hiding his true identity by pretending to adopt another. It would be an understatement to say Thornhill's life is never the same from that point on. James Mason and a very young Martin Landau portray the foreign (Soviet?) spies and they are perfect choices for their roles. Mason's character, Phillip Vandamm, reminds me quite a lot of one he would play over twenty years later, the defense attorney in 'The Verdict.' Both are well-spoken, quietly threatening, and absolutely cold-blooded while appearing very mannered and reasonable. Nobody does this type of role as well as Mason. After a point, it is revealed that in fact, there is no government agent named George Kaplan. He is a purely fictitious character created by US intelligence to provide cover for another, flesh and blood agent working the case. Thornhill accidentally and unintentionally being mistaken for Kaplan provides the US agency both risks and opportunities; in any event, they are not at all inclined to come to Thornhill's aid and clear him as that would endanger the real agent. Yes, it's complicated and I'm even leaving a lot of stuff out! The head of the intelligence unit, 'The Professor,' is wonderfully underplayed by reliable old Leo G. Carroll. Nothing surprises The Professor anymore, everything the agency does makes perfect sense... this is a man who long ago resigned himself to doing whatever is necessary to achieve, well, whatever is necessary. Because there's nothing else you can do, really. Carroll's conversations with Grant are priceless. The final piece in this convoluted puzzle is a strange woman named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who Thornhill meets on a train as he tries to evade both the spies and the police. Eve helps him and for a while her motivation is unclear; it seems as though she may just be a thrill-seeker who likes living dangerously by picking up strange men. There are some wonderfully provocative exchanges between her and Thornhill; I suspect these are about as far as a mainstream Hollywood film could go in 1959 but aside from that, they are beautifully written by Ernest Lehman and just as well-acted by Grant and Saint. There is a real chemistry between them and... what's the old saying? 'Sparks fly?' Cary Grant himself seems like an odd choice to play Thornhill. With his cultured mannerisms and one-of-a-kind manner of speech, he's hardly the Everyman James Stewart specialized in portraying for Hitchcock (Stewart was originally to play the role but was dropped in favor of Grant.) It is an unusual character for Grant, but one thing is for certain- he is much more convincing as a ladies' man than Stewart ever was. And a funny thing about the character of Thornhill is we really don't get to know him well before the identity mix-up, other than he's a fast-talking ad exec who's twice divorced. Everything else that we learn about him, we learn from his reactions and responses to the situation he finds himself in. He's far from being perfect or brilliant, but he is resourceful and seems to surprise even himself in the degree to which he is attracted to and cares for Eve. Lehman and Hitchcock have thrown everything including the kitchen sink into the plot of 'North by Northwest' and somehow it all works magically. No doubt this was a real crowd-pleaser back in 1959 and it managed that without compromising Hitchcock's talent and vision one iota. A wonderful, wonderful film.",10,2,4,26 May 2008
The Alamo," subject deserves better
","As a native Texan, I learned the story of the Alamo early on and it became, as I think it does for most Texans, part of my psyche. The subject carries a lot of emotional investment, so it should come as no surprise that I want any movie made about it to be a good one. And so it was with 2004's 'The Alamo.' My hopes were high, despite reading about a troubled production, that this time they would get it right. The 1960 John Wayne epic had its heart in the right place (too much so, really) and succeeded admirably at times, but too often Wayne indulged himself in dumb comic relief and unreservedly hackneyed sentiment. That movie cried out for a better director. In terms of historical accuracy, this latest version of the famous battle comes out ahead, but in terms of cinema, it does not. It thankfully never reaches the depths of silliness Wayne's version did, but neither does it reach the heights of glory and drama that earlier film achieved, particularly in the climactic battle scene. The battle scenes here are often eerily quiet and lack the intensity of that earlier film. Of the four central characters (Travis, Bowie, Crockett, and Houston), Jason Patric does best as Bowie, in a very different portrayal than Richard Widmark's. Here Bowie is almost the epitome of 'cool,' a far cry from Widmark's impulsive hothead, despite succumbing over the course of the story to 'consumption' (tuberculosis). Billy Bob Thornton provides an interesting 'alternative' reading of Davy Crockett as well, more showman than hero... a better storyteller than soldier. His fame precedes him and also entraps him; he confides to Bowie at one point that if everyone wasn't watching him, he might just jump over the Alamo walls and make a break for it. Dennis Quaid is Sam Houston, who figures more prominently in this 'Alamo' than the previous one. Quaid seems to struggle at times to get his head around the complicated Houston, a fearless yet reckless leader of men who struggles with his own weaknesses and is often his own worst enemy. It is an adequate performance. Where 'The Alamo' really fails is in young Patrick Wilson's wholly inadequate portrayal of William Travis. There are several reasons Travis is the most important character in this story, but I think the main one is that, of the four men, he is the one who is known for only one thing- commanding the Alamo. Crockett, Bowie, and Houston are all famous for other endeavors, pursuits, and achievements. Travis alone is inextricably linked to this famous battle. You simply cannot tell the story of the Alamo well without telling the story of Travis well, and this 'Alamo' doesn't. The script is part of the problem but it's more than that. Instead of the gallant, swashbuckling hero Laurence Harvey portrayed, Travis seems more of a bookworm, annoying more than inspiring. Say what you will about Harvey's over-the-top, flamboyantly-costumed leader, but he made the character a mythic figure and was without a doubt the best thing about the 1960 film. Wilson's Travis by comparison seems more like a nervous high-school kid. In the earlier version, Travis got on everyone's nerves because he was a strict disciplinarian, a stickler for military detail; in the 2004 film, he gets on everyone's nerves because he's, well, a nerd. Probably neither portrayal is particularly accurate; however, one can definitely see Laurence Harvey's character writing that he will 'never retreat or surrender,' as the real Travis did. So it is this flaw more than anything that ultimately sinks the latest 'Alamo.' Here and there are some good scenes and intelligent retellings of the people and places surrounding the famous siege. The Mexican leader, Santa Anna, is entertainingly interpreted as sort of a Mexican mafia chieftain. There is a memorable scene where Thornton's Crockett recounts a battle with Indians that ends in a somewhat stomach-churning manner. And there is the slightly curious ending, which portrays the Battle of San Jacinto, where the Texans under Sam Houston actually defeated Santa Anna and his army and won their independence. The makers of 'The Alamo,' 2004 edition, had their hearts in the right place just as John Wayne did, but for all their good intentions missed the mark, just as he had.",5,2,4,2 April 2008
Aliens," exciting follow-up to a classic
","I once made the observation that 'Aliens' deserves an award for panache for trying to outdo 'Alien.' It would be more accurate to say it takes the story of Ripley and those slimy, malevolent lifeforms in a direction that the first movie didn't even try to; specifically, into the realm of action/adventure/combat flicks. To its credit, it keeps much of the original's look and feel, in art direction and sound. But the volume (so to speak) is cranked WAY up, as is the violence quotient, and the last 45 minutes or so feel like a roller-coaster ride through hell. Opinions differ whether or not this is an improvement; my own feeling is that 'Alien' is the superior film, hands down. But 'Aliens' certainly won the box office battle and has always been more generally popular. The plot has Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) going back to the deadly planet with a squad of 'colonial marines.' It is 57 years later (she slept that long in suspended animation before being discovered) and the planet is now inhabited by humans in a small, desolate community. The aliens (and there are a bunch of them now) never bothered the colonists until recently and when contact with Earth ceases, the marines are sent in and Ripley goes with them as a reluctant 'advisor.' The marines themselves are a colorful group of stereotypes, straight out of an old WW2 war flick- the tough-as-nails sergeant, the quiet loner, the two bad-ass machine gunners, the whiner, etc. They are led by an ineffective lieutenant who we soon discover isn't up to the challenge. Also along for the ride is the 'company man,' Burke (Paul Reiser, in a nice turn as a complete slimeball). After an early encounter with the aliens cuts their number in half, Ripley more or less assumes command by sheer force of personality. (And Weaver out-acts the pants off whoever she shares the screen with.) There are plenty of slam-bang shoot-'em-up sequences, all very well staged and very intense. But somewhere along the way, 'Aliens' diminishes the essential creepiness of the creatures just slightly by making them so often exploding targets. And the audience realizes long before the marines that it doesn't matter how many of them you kill, there are always more. A single colony survivor, a young girl named Newt, is adopted by Ripley and the others and proves more savvy than any of them. There is a funny, scary moment early on shortly after Newt is found; Ripley asks her if she wouldn't feel safer staying with Ripley and the others. The little girl just shakes her head no. Ripley goes on to say these are soldiers, and Newt responds, 'It won't make any difference.' After chases, explosions, more gunplay and one false climax, we get the final showdown between Ripley, in one of the spaceship's loaders, and the alien queen. (Trying to distract the queen from pursuing Newt, Weaver spits out her famous line, 'Get away from her, you bitch!') The fight itself is fairly brief, and the queen is finally dispatched off out into space, much like the alien in the first film was. Director James Cameron certainly deserves credit for not making a boring sequel; 'Aliens' is anything but. It would probably be hoping for too much to expect a second film to be as wondrously terrifying as Ridley Scott's original; like capturing lightning twice, almost impossible. So Cameron wisely shifts gears and takes us on a different adventure altogether, and it's a very exciting one.",8,0,1,6 January 2009
The Exorcist," Unforgettable
","Watching 'The Exorcist' today, one can safely say it has lost none of its essential power to haunt and terrify. I had only seen it once long ago and my memory proved a bit faulty. For instance, I was surprised how inconsequential Lee J. Cobb's role as Lt. Kinderman really is. And Max Von Sydow's part is shorter than I thought as well, though he has a pivotal part as the older priest, Merrin. The film really focuses on Ellen Burstyn's character (Chris McNeil), Linda Blair (Regan), and of course Jason Miller (Father Karras). Chris McNeil is not a particularly likable person, despite being a devoted mother. She is a spoiled, petulant actress who tends to throw hissy fits if she doesn't get her way. Yet she is the audience's surrogate in the film, a non-believer who ultimately, ironically becomes the most fervent advocate of having an exorcism performed on Regan. And to go off on a tangent for a moment, I believe one's reaction to the film is different depending on if you are Catholic, or were raised Catholic, because what is shown in 'The Exorcist' is pretty much every Catholic's worst nightmare. I can't say what someone else might think of it; perhaps it comes across as simply a very intense horror film. But for those brought up Catholic, I think it is doubly so. The damn previews scared me so bad, I wouldn't even see it when it came out. Father Karras is the center of the film, the doubting, tortured priest who ends up making the greatest sacrifice. Jason Miller is perfect in the role. Karras is too intelligent for his own good and yet when he sees what must be done, he proves his fears do not make him a coward. There is a telling moment when Chris asks him if Regan is going to die; he turns to her and without hesitation, says, 'No.' And poor Linda Blair is really run through the wringer. One can only imagine the rigors she was put through during the course of filming. But she is game, and though her part has been parodied endlessly in the years since, she acquits herself very well. A couple of shots do not hold up well, for instance, the infamous head-turning scene which now looks more phony than frightening, like a ventriloquist's doll. Most of the special effects though are excellent, as convincing today as they were 35 years ago. One of the most insidious and maddening scenes comes right at the end. The demon inside Regan has killed Father Merrin, which Karras discovers when he re-enters the bedroom. As he tries to revive the old priest, Regan sits on a corner of the bed and begins giggling, as though she has just torn up her best friend's diary or something similarly trivial. Karras goes almost insane with anger, throws her to the ground and begins punching her as hard as he can. It is a powerful scene, unforgettable... as is the whole movie.",9,1,2,23 February 2009
Gone with the Wind," the ultimate chick flick?
","So what can you say about 'Gone With The Wind' that hasn't blah blah blah... I don't know for certain, but I'll try. How about it's the grandmama (as opposed to granddaddy) of all chick flicks? I think it is. I watched it for the first time in years the other night and although it's still terribly familiar, I was able to pick up on some things with a fresh perspective. I've never understood why Scarlett O'Hara is considered in some circles to be an 'admirable' character. Maybe 'enviable' because of her gorgeous appearance, which is how most of the other females in the film seem to feel about her. But she's spoiled rotten, enjoys being spoiled rotten, and apparently her sole ambition in life is to go on being spoiled rotten. The admirable things she does at various points in the movie- shooting a marauding soldier, delivering a baby- she only does because she absolutely has to, and she hates having to do them. Or, to put it another way, Scarlett only does them because she can't be bothered with the alternative. Make no mistake, she is a fascinating character and Vivien Leigh is cast to perfection as her, but it's frightening to think a couple of generations of girls might have considered her a role model of sorts. There is an intrinsic dopiness to 'Gone With The Wind' that all the wonderful sets and beautiful costumes can't conceal. In fact, sometimes those costumes seem to be more what the film's about than the story itself. The film is a Selznick Production, but it has the look and feel of a top-shelf MGM flick. And as with every major MGM production of the time, there has to be an overriding theme, a heavy-handed moral to be taken from the film, and in this case, it is that Scarlett learns to love the land as her father did. Which she does. But nobody buys it, in fact her final words are barely remembered. Most people think, 'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn' is the last line in the movie. Just like most people remember the green dress above everything else. There are some undeniably powerful scenes in 'Gone With The Wind' (at over three and a half hours, there had better be) and some funny ones, and Clark Gable is perfect too as Rhett Butler, rogue, reprobate, and all-around Southern Cavalier. To me, one frustrating aspect of his character, or I should say everyone's reaction to his character, is that he is forever speaking blunt truths and common sense and nobody seems to hear him. Certainly Scarlett doesn't. Likewise, his warnings early on about the South's chances in the upcoming Civil War go unheeded. One wonders why he hangs around with people who treat him like a cad, a liar, a man with no honor when he's actually the most honorable person in the movie, with the possible exception of Melanie Hamilton. Now there's a ingeniously thought out character- Melanie. She provides poetic justice for Scarlett. Nothing Scarlett says can rile her; in fact she takes every hateful, venomous uttering from Scarlett and turns it around into something wonderful. It is almost a running gag that the meaner Scarlett is to Melanie, the more forgiving and admiring Melanie becomes of Scarlett. The scenes of death and destruction in Atlanta are memorable, including the famous long shot of the dead and wounded soldiers lying in the main street. The torturous soap opera that makes up the second half of the film will see male viewers rapidly losing interest, as it begins to resemble a 1930's version of 'Dynasty.' Even Rhett Butler's character lacks purpose for a long stretch, and his increasingly pointless upbraiding of Scarlett and her shortcomings becomes tiresome. She will never change and he begins to look foolish in thinking anything he says will make a difference.There obviously was no scrimping on any aspect of production for 'Gone With The Wind,' and the film succeeds in dazzling the eye throughout, whether it be a soiree at the plantation or Atlanta being set afire. Too many of the images have a 'glamor shot' feel to them, such as an early one where Scarlett's father runs after her in front of the mansion; it fairly screams 'look at her dress!' There is a constant tug-of-war between such scenes and meatier aspects of the story. Again, given the film's great length, there is plenty of room for both, 'something for everyone' as the saying goes and it certainly is a classic of its kind. Still, it says something about both 'Gone With The Wind' and its loyal audience over the years that its most fondly recalled image is of Scarlett wearing a green gown made from the living room drapes.",7,2,3,15 April 2008
No Country for Old Men," exciting, thought-provoking Coen Brothers' film
","A riveting and intense movie, 'No Country for Old Men' can apparently be seen on a couple of levels. I'm afraid I only saw it on one, that of a conventional chase/thriller done with style and intelligence, with some unexpected twists and turns. It's also quite gory and violent; it would be hard to argue though that the violence here does not add to the film's characters and its story. Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh ranks right up there with Robert Mitchum's Max Cady ('Cape Fear') and Dennis Hopper's Frank ('Blue Velvet') as one of the creepiest, most malevolent bad guys ever to stalk across the silver screen. Like those classically evil characters, he is relentless and ubiquitous, seemingly impossible to kill and without a shred of conscience. Chigurh exists for one reason: to kill in cold blood again and again. Virtually none of the people he kills pose any sort of threat to him personally; he could find out what he wants and be on his way, but it appears that if someone has seen him and spoken to him, a code of sorts within him demands the person be killed. Yet occasionally, the person isn't, for reasons never made clear. A couple of times in the movie, he lets a coin toss decide a person's fate. Chigurh's prey in 'No Country for Old Men' is Llewelyn Moss, played with taciturn toughness by Josh Brolin. I think the main thing that makes this story work is the fact that Moss is almost a match for Chigurh. While many of the rest of the people we meet in the film are simply mowed down by Chigurh, Moss proves to be a cunning and resourceful foe, at one point even turning the tables on the seemingly invincible executioner and shooting HIM. The third main character is Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. As always, Jones is fascinating to watch and gives a fine performance, but I found myself wondering how many times he's played the same role. 'The Fugitive,' 'U.S. Marshals,' 'The Client,' even 'Men In Black'... they're all essentially the same character, a cranky but endearing authority figure with a droll sense of humor. It's a character that wears well though, and nobody does it better than Jones. Here he is investigating the murders and Moss' disappearance though he stands apart from the action, wryly commenting on the case and life in general while never actually encountering Chigurh. The plot concerns Moss chancing upon a satchel with two million dollars in it at the scene of an apparent shootout between two rival Mexican drug gangs, at a remote spot in West Texas. All the gang members are dead save one who is badly wounded. Moss makes off with the money but quickly discovers others are after him to recover it. Chigurh works for one of the gangs as their prime hit-man and thus begins his pitiless and unrelenting cross-state pursuit of Moss and the stolen loot. Moss ingeniously escapes time and again, and Chigurh just as ingeniously tracks him down to his next hiding place. (Pity the poor motel clerks wherever Moss chooses to hole up; they almost always fall victim to Chigurh.) The ending is 'unconventional,' as they say, but hey, it's a Coen Brothers' film... what do you expect? I'll leave the existential explanations of 'what it all means' to someone else and say, to me, the lesson of 'No Country for Old Men' is that nobody just forgets about two million dollars.",8,1,2,19 May 2009
Saving Private Ryan," a fresh perspective
","'Saving Private Ryan' is Steven Spielberg's brave attempt to redefine the conventional war film, and specifically World War II films. More than that even, it's an attempt to explain the conflict itself to a generation that never knew it firsthand. Spielberg proceeds from the assumption that baby boomers are hardwired to doubt their country's motives in any war and 'Saving Private Ryan' seems to be his way of saying there was at least one war the U.S. fought where it was clearly and completely in the right. Whether he succeeded is something that's difficult to gauge. In many ways, 'Saving Private Ryan' is your standard-issue combat flick, albeit a very well-made one. Some scenes would be almost interchangeable with those from any number of movies where G.I.'s trudge across Europe and engage the Germans at various points in heated battles. But there's something else at work here that none of those earlier films put across in quite the same manner. At times, it's almost intangible. There is a feeling of the here and now about the film, that we are really living and experiencing what the soldiers did. Nothing puts this across more vividly than the opening scene. After a brief prologue in a present-day French cemetery, the scene shifts to the bloodiest day of the war, when the Allies landed on the Normandy beaches. I think it is fair to say that there has never been a more realistic depiction of what the first few army units faced in those first awful hours, the chaos, the death, the wholesale slaughter really of thousands of young men trying to gain a foothold on the beaches there. I remember reading about an early screening of 'Ryan' for WW2 veterans; one was asked about this scene, and the old man replied grimly and succinctly, 'That's pretty much how it was.' Though nothing in the rest of the film is quite as brutally graphic, the scene sets the stage for what is to follow. We are reminded that the vast majority of Americans were not professional soldiers; they were ordinary people lifted from ordinary jobs to fight in the most consequential armed conflict in their country's history, which makes their sacrifices and their courage that much more profound and poignant. The story, which can easily be seen as an allegory, has to do with a group of four brothers, all soldiers serving in the war. And all have been killed in action, except one, the Private Ryan of the title. It is decided that this family has sacrificed more than its share, and so a special army squad is dispatched to find Ryan and send him home. Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as the everyman, generically-named Capt. Miller, the schoolteacher turned combat soldier. His dying words to Private Ryan, 'Earn this. Earn it!' are the message he (and Spielberg) hoped the following generation would take to heart. Again, it's hard to know whether or not that generation has.",9,2,4,22 February 2008
Patton," George C. Scott= George S. Patton
","'Patton' is pretty much a one-man show. George C. Scott's Oscar-winning portrayal dominates the film and overshadows all the other characters, much as Patton dominated those under his command in real life. There is no real attempt to create another strong character in the movie; Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is mainly used to react to Patton and the British General Montgomery is seen as a caricature, a stereotypical stuffy Brit who contrasts with Patton's earthy and impulsive nature. Scott truly becomes Patton in this film; it's difficult now to think of one without the other. The characterization and the film have many layers. On the one hand, 'Patton' is a straightforward war flick, with big, well-staged battle sequences. But it is also a brooding psychological study of a complicated individual, one who's near-madness goes hand in hand with his cunning and courage. Patton comes across as, among many things, an outsider in his own chosen field of endeavor. The other officers, including the generals who are his superiors, consider him something of a brilliant kook, to be used when needed and shunted aside when he isn't, or when he embarrasses them. Eisenhower, who is never seen or heard in the film, and his group of generals are businesslike, no-nonsense types who share none of Patton's flamboyance or showmanship. To them, the war is an ugly business to be concluded as quickly and painlessly as possible. For Patton, it is a holy, glorious crusade that defines him and his reason for being. Some critics claimed the movie was both pro-war and anti-war. I have to agree with Roger Ebert, it's no such thing; it's about as pro-war as you can get. But since its setting is World War II, that is not a difficult or far-fetched notion to accept. Even in this confused day and age where we agonize over whether conflicts are worth getting involved in, most people agree that the U.S. was on the right side in the second world war and that vanquishing Hitler and the Nazis was the right thing to do. Patton embodies that ideal and so we naturally root for him even if some of his actions and statements go against what we would do. George C. Scott so inhabits the character of Patton that it almost becomes irrelevant whether the portrayal is one-hundred per cent accurate. As war historians have pointed out, liberties are taken both with dialogue and plot points; there was no 'race' for Messina between Montgomery and Patton, there were actually two soldiers who were slapped, etc. But these easily fall into the realm of cinematic license and do nothing to detract from the essential reality Scott brings to his characterization. And it certainly says something about General Patton that the famous speech he gave in 1944 had to be toned down for a movie that was released in 1970!",10,2,5,26 January 2008
Black Hawk Down," unflinching and disturbing war film
","'Black Hawk Down,' a riveting account of a US Special Forces raid into Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993 has come under criticism from various quarters, but not for reasons that are substantial or even make much sense. One of the Somalian warlords captured in the raid says it is not truthful because his party was in one car, not a convoy of three, and that only Somalian women wear earrings, not the men. Malaysian authorities are upset that their contribution is minimized (shades of the Brits and 'Objective, Burma') and assorted critics claim the film misrepresents the Somali people and is 'pro-war.' If 'Black Hawk Down' does not portray the situation in Somalia with complete accuracy, it is surely only in those things that films traditionally take license with, just as is done when compressing a 500-page novel into a two-hour screen entertainment. The salient facts are there; what you see in the movie is essentially what happened during those horrific hours between the time the raid started and the US forces, the ones that survived, were finally extracted. In fact, I daresay 'Black Hawk Down' is a great deal more accurate than the vast majority of war films based on true stories. Somalia has not had a functioning central government since 1991. It is more an area than a nation; numerous warring factions fought and continue to fight for control and the general populace are often caught in the crossfire. Many of them habitually chew khat, a plant with amphetamine-type effects. As portrayed in the film, many civilians are, frankly, stoned, some of them to the point of appearing zombie-like. Whether or not this is an accurate representation, I will leave to the experts, but it does not seem an unreasonable portrayal to me. As for being 'pro-war,' that seems an odd criticism. If depicting a military operation in which US soldiers are killed, sometimes brutally, and where so many aspects of that operation went terribly wrong, and in which the conclusion can hardly be considered a 'happy ending'... if all that qualifies a film to be considered 'pro-war,' well I guess it is. Doesn't seem that way, though. 'Black Hawk Down' is, however, a nail-bitingly tense movie that at times has the nightmarish feeling of a horror film; it shares many of the same qualities. Generally, I think, it is the feeling that help is so close but tantalizingly out of reach. Director Ridley Scott once again uses his considerable talents, this time to paint a picture of a region on earth that has fallen back from a state of civilization into a vicious, lawless condition, where gangs run by warlords make the rules, control food, water, and medicine, and mete out their own murderous form of 'justice.' I suppose the one recurring thought that kept running through my head as I watched was, what the hell are our soldiers doing there? I recommend this movie for the raw power of its images and its realistic depiction of a horrific situation, but be advised it is very unsettling.",9,0,0,1 June 2008
Quiz Show," detailed look at a scandal
","In 'Quiz Show,' one gets the feeling that Robert Redford has made a movie that is more interesting than the subject it covers. In the annals of great events of the twentieth century, the quiz show scandals of the late fifties would rank pretty low even then, and less so today. Why? I'm not sure. Perhaps because so many entertainments today are blatantly phony, it's hard to get very worked up about a rigged TV program from fifty years ago. Pro wrestling is the obvious example, but there is the whole phenomenon of 'reality' television that, while perhaps not technically 'rigged,' is so overblown in its self-importance as to feel unnervingly fake to most discerning people. But then, that shouldn't really matter, should it? Movies don't have to be about big subjects. Certainly some of the very best have been about small or intimate themes. And 'Quiz Show' does a good job of telling its story, large, small or in-between. It has a nice feel of time and place, though it doesn't portray the fifties as convincingly as some other films have. I think this has more to do with the dialogue than set decorations or any other visual element. It seems a bit too knowing, too obviously written from a current perspective, especially from the show-in-question's two producers, which seem right out of present day. Maybe Redford is making a point: some things never change. Part of the fun of 'Quiz Show' is identifying the various actors. None are megastars but a lot of them are familiar and I found myself saying, there's Griffin Dunne, there's the guy from 'Ed Wood' and there's the chief of staff from 'Air Force One', etc. I suppose that is not unusual except that there are so many of them in 'Quiz Show;' it seems a mini who's who of working actors. Oh, and Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren. He's certainly photogenic and is meant to project the shy, somewhat self-deprecating intelligence of the real Van Doren as well as his tortured conscience. The self-deprecation though is largely a pose as the character is really quite full of himself. Fiennes' performance is adequate, but he smiles too much. You begin to wonder if he has any other expression than smiling winsomely at whomever he's speaking to. The story, as well as the truth behind it, is simple enough. A Jeopardy-type program in the late 50's, 'Twenty-One,' supplies Van Doren with answers for some of the questions (as it had for the preceding champion, whose popularity had 'plateaued'), thus ensuring Van Doren wins every time and remains on the air. A federal investigator learns the truth and eventually Van Doren confesses in a hearing. It was a big deal at the time, giving impetus to the quiz shows being 'cleaned up.' (How 1950's is that? First horror comic books, then quiz shows.) Looking at it today though, it's strictly gossip column fodder, right up there with 'did the Monkees play their own instruments?' Charles Van Doren's father, who was a rather famous professor and intellectual in his own right, considers the programs hardly worthy of contempt, and that cheating on them was roughly equivalent to 'plagiarizing comic books.' Then at the end, Twenty-One's producers further make the argument that the hearings are a big to-do over nothing. According to one, the sponsor makes money, the network makes money, the contestants make money, and the public is entertained. So, he asks, who is hurt? I find it hard to argue his point. There is a charm in the naiveté' of past decades, yet at times one is inclined to shake one's head and think, 'those people had WAY too much time on their hands.' For all its well-informed nostalgia, 'Quiz Show' seems a perfect example of that.",6,6,10,24 February 2008
The Dark Knight," Batman, finally done right
","Any superhero movie clocking in at two and half hours will receive the criticism that it's too long, from me anyway. And so it is for 'The Dark Knight.' That said, I can't find much else wrong with this cleverly-written, expertly-acted, perfectly-paced, and wonderfully directed sequel to 'Batman Begins.' It almost goes without saying that this is the best Batman movie to date, though that is really damning it with faint praise. The trend in recent years has been to take movies based on comic book superheroes to new heights of realism, and 'The Dark Knight' is certainly the latest and most refined example. You find yourself, as you watch, forgetting at times the character's humble origins and simply accepting this as a great film, just as you would, say, 'Silence of the Lambs' or 'The Godfather.' It's that good. And yes, Heath Ledger as the Joker is a revelation. A sadist, a masochist, a psychopath, and a smooth talker... at least he likes to think so. Like most individuals with a warped outlook on life, he can't understand why people don't accept his reasoning, which makes perfect sense to him. And of course, there are bits of truth in a lot of what he says. It is a rare melding of a terrifically written part with an actor who truly inhabits that part. The character has 'scene stealer' all over it, and Ledger takes full advantage. But the great thing about 'The Dark Knight' is that all of the major characters are so well-written, and acted. Christian Bale is fine as Batman, and he's even better as Bruce Wayne. The temptation prior to 'Batman Begins', I think, was always to portray Wayne as something of a flyweight, even if this was an intentional ruse so no one would guess he might be Batman. Here, that pretense is done away with; Bruce Wayne is smart, funny, and substantial. He just happens to be super-rich. All of this put together makes him an extremely appealing character. Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent provides a traditional leading man for the movie, the crusading DA who proves to be more multi-layered than he might seem at first glance. Another fine performance. And Lt. (later Commissioner) Gordon, played by Gary Oldman, is fleshed out to a greater degree than ever before, becoming much more than a hapless police official; in fact, he's almost the equal of Batman himself, in terms of heroism, self-sacrifice, and bringing the bad guys to justice. He and Batman truly are kindred spirits. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine are along for the ride too, and they are very believable in their roles. I wonder in how many films now Freeman has played the part of the kindly, wise older black man who helps flawed white people find their way. I'm guessing at least fifteen. Other observations- I've read a couple of reviews that suggest comparisons between 'The Dark Knight' and today's world, specifically the war on terrorism. I see that too, and here's my take on it. The Joker represents the terrorists, in the mindless and heartless pleasure that comes from the taking of life, the disruption of life, and the resulting anarchy. Ordinary people, including in this case the press, police officers, and victims of the Joker are often inclined to blame Batman for the loss of life, the suggestion being that if he didn't get involved, didn't 'provoke' the Joker, these people wouldn't have died. In other words, don't fight back and maybe they'd be left alone. Sound familiar? And Batman is further vilified at the end, when he takes the blame for deaths he had nothing to do with, realizing this is another role he needs to fill, in order for politically correct society to feel good about itself. He knows he must be the ultimate 'bad cop,' the fall guy who will never earn the respect or gratitude of the larger community, yet which most people realize without admitting it publicly is the real protector of their security. I find that aspect of 'The Dark Knight' very damning of our culture today and at the same time, very reassuring in the honesty of its message. In any event, director Christopher Nolan deserves much credit for starting the Batman saga all over again and setting it on the right path, first with 'Batman Begins' and now, 'The Dark Knight.'",9,1,4,21 July 2008
The Untouchables," should have been much better
","I've been debating how hard to come down on 'The Untouchables' since I watched it again the other day. I don't know anything about the background of the film; whether it was made in a hurry or if there were problems with the production or a lot of re-shooting afterward. All I know is that with all the talent involved and the subject matter chosen, this should have been a masterpiece, a classic along the lines of 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas,' but sadly it doesn't even come close. To say it's an enjoyable little film about nabbing Al Capone is damning it with the slightest of praise. I mean, look at the cast. Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia, even Robert De Niro! Can't get much better than that. So it's not them; they do what they can with the material. David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay (or at least gets credit for it), is one of the greatest living American authors. And yet the screenplay is as flat and thin as cardboard. It is almost impossible not to feel that other hands were involved in the story and dialogue; it has practically none of the incisiveness or bite one typically associates with Mamet. The director is Brian De Palma. That's where I'm laying the blame. I have never felt De Palma is the great director some claim him to be and there are many aspects of 'The Untouchables' which reinforce my opinion- multiple examples of shameless audience manipulation and tired clichés. The geeky accountant who becomes a bad-ass during a confrontation and kills a bunch of bad guys. The adoring wife who has one expression, one that says 'I love you so much my heart might melt.' The old Irish cop who dispenses endless pearls of wisdom and lessons-in-life. The straight-arrow leader who has a personal code he never violates. And all of this is put forward in such a ham-handed fashion; there is no subtlety to anything here. What's even worse is we never really get to know the characters; they are painted so broadly, they never register as anything but stereotypes. But there are SOME good bits in 'The Untouchables.' Mainly Robert De Niro, who is always interesting to watch. His shorthand impersonation of Al Capone strikes me as a throwaway, but it's a good throwaway and he manages to invest a fair amount of menace into the character, behind the fake smile and amiability Capone uses to disarm people. The same can more or less be said about Sean Connery (I can't believe he won an Oscar for this though). Kevin Costner is saddled with perhaps the weakest dialogue as Elliot Ness; the film can never decide who he is or what to do with him. At the beginning, reporters ask Ness, why bother to enforce prohibition? Because it's the law of the land, he says. At the end, they ask him what he'll do if prohibition is repealed. Probably go get a drink, he says. I guess that's supposed to be meaningful and profound. There seems to be no logic to the dialogue or situations. At one point, apropos of nothing, Connery's character leads them on a liquor bust literally on the spur of the moment, with no pre-planning, no explanation of how he knows about it. 'The Untouchables' has a climax of sorts in a railway station, then a courtroom scene which makes no sense at all (how can you switch juries at the END of a trial?). This film consistently disappoints; the fact that it still provides a modicum of entertainment is due mainly to the acting skills of De Niro and Connery.",5,141,213,25 May 2008
The Godfather: Part III," overly reverential follow-up
","'The Godfather Part III' suffers from a bad case of wishing it was either 'The Godfather' or 'The Godfather Pt. II'. You'll lose count of all the situations, scenes, ideas, and lines of dialogue that are lifted either in part or in whole from the two earlier films. It's almost as if Francis Ford Coppola feels it necessary to constantly remind the audience that this is in fact a 'Godfather' film, rather than just getting on with it. The film is generally good enough to stand on its own, though it does suffer in comparison in many ways. Al Pacino has a hard time getting inside the character of Michael Corleone again. He makes a half-hearted attempt to act old, but it's never terribly convincing. His supporting cast is much weaker than in either of the other two, partially because of new faces brought in, such as (usually) reliable Eli Wallach as an aged Mafia boss. His performance is only adequate, and then there is Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter, Mary. Her acting is more on a level with your average teen flick and at times is hard to watch. For reasons that never seem very clear or worthwhile, Diane Keaton is brought back as Kay in what could be called an extended cameo. Her scenes with Pacino are not satisfying either; Michael is courteous and flattering, suggesting they could be together again. Kay basically tells him what a slimeball he is and that she loathes him. Speaking of lifted scenes, there's one in 'Part III' that could almost be considered a 'response' to one in the original movie, where Kay watches Michael assuming the role of the Don and sees the door shut, symbolizing her being shut out of that part of his life. Here, in 'Godfather III', there is a scene where Michael and Kay almost achieve a kind of rapprochement when Michael is suddenly called into the next room to handle some dirty Mafia business. In what might be called 'Kay's Revenge', this time it is she who walks slowly out of camera view, in effect 'closing the door' behind her. Most of their exchanges though are simply rehashes of things said in the second film. There are so many lines lifted from the first two Godfathers, the effect borders on parody at times. 'Never tell anyone outside the family what you're thinking.' 'Today, all Corleone family business will be settled.' 'Part III' is so reverential and referential to those works, it's almost like one long homage to them. Another character from them, Connie, appears at odd moments like a ghost from the past, long enough to express concern for Michael and the family, a kind of melancholy loyalty, then she disappears again. Sonny Corleone's son, Vincent, is played by Andy Garcia and is the one character to bring some urgently needed kick and vitality to the film. Like his father, Vincent is a hot-head, a 'shoot first and ask questions later' kind of guy. He wants to solve the family's problems the way they USED to and of course Michael has spent almost his whole life moving away from the mob style of doing things and making the Corleone family legitimate. The plot itself has to do with various intrigues, financial and otherwise, at the Vatican and Michael becoming involved with some unsavory types who, shall we say, do not have his best interests at heart. 'The Godfather, Pt. III' is a good film, not a great one, one that certainly goes out of its way to remind us what masterpieces the first and second 'Godfather' films were.",6,0,1,7 October 2008
Psycho," Hitchcock's best
","'Psycho' has long been a favorite of mine, though for a long time I was unable to explain exactly why. It wasn't a horror film, at least not in the way I generally thought of them; there's no monster and there are no supernatural aspects. It fits more into the murder mystery category. But it has the feel of a horror film and of course today is usually regarded as such; in fact, many regard it as the best horror film ever made. Alfred Hitchcock, it seems to me, knew exactly what he wanted 'Psycho' to be and didn't worry about categories. An aura of desperate fear and paranoia permeates the film from start to finish, enveloping all the main characters. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane, in particular, is the very picture of someone on the edge, constantly looking over her shoulder, always afraid of being discovered. Her character is all the more believable because Marion Crane seems like the last person one would expect to behave as she does, stealing $40,000 from the office she works at so that her lover (John Gavin) can pay off his debts and they can be together. It is a rash act for a woman who initially seems like your typical office worker, leading a humdrum existence except for the stolen moments she shares with her lover. But she acts on her dream because she is desperate, and desperation drives her. 'Psycho' is atypical in many ways. For one thing, Crane, who is clearly the focal point of the film, is killed fairly early on. The emphasis then shifts to Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), his mother, and other characters who are trying to determine Crane's whereabouts. Bates seems to acquire Crane's mantle of paranoia, at first certain no one will ever come looking for her and even if they do, will never discover that his 'mother' killed her. Seeming a quirky but harmless momma's boy in his early scenes, Bates is slowly revealed to be insane- the 'psycho' of the title. Shot in black and white on a modest budget, 'Psycho' didn't seem to be anything special upon release. Most critics were less than impressed. But audiences certainly took to it, making it one of Hitchcock's most successful films; it grossed $32,000,000 (a huge sum at the time) and subsequent re-issues and television showings added to that figure. And since then, its reputation has grown with each passing year, with reams of film criticism devoted to it and dissecting it. Regardless of the category one wishes to fit it in, horror/thriller/mystery/crime drama, it has long since passed needing such labels, now simply regarded as Hitchcock's most well-known work, possibly his best, one that regularly makes all kinds of cinema 'top ten' lists for best film ever. Bernard Herrmann is easily as crucial to the movie's success as any of the actors; his music score has become irrevocably linked to key moments in 'Psycho,' the shrieking violins almost a trademark. The infamous 'shower scene' has become a part of pop culture history, discussed and parodied countless times. And Anthony Perkins will rightfully be remembered always as Norman Bates, forever reminding us that 'a boy's best friend is his mother.'",10,2,3,30 December 2007
The Bridge on the River Kwai," classic POW drama
","As with most war films utilizing a POW camp as the primary setting made prior to say, the 1970's, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' leaves most viewers to speculate that conditions were in all likelihood many times more brutal than portrayed on the screen. Surely the Japanese had more devious methods of torture than simply having officers stand all day in the hot sun, or placing their commander in solitary confinement, as miserable as either of those situations may have been. And it is doubtful the Japanese commandant would have been talked out of shooting several prisoners simply because it is pointed out to him there might be an inquiry into the matter. Those matters aside, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is very compelling and believable, the story of a large group of British soldiers led by Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), and one American, Commander Shears (William Holden), being held in a desolate Japanese prison camp in southern Burma during WW2. At the center of the story is a battle of wills between Nicholson and the Japanese camp commander Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Nicholson's defiance is genuine, but it is done in that peculiarly quirky British fashion which seems, especially in the film's latter sections, exaggerated to an almost unfathomable degree. When Nicholson finally agrees to build the bridge across the Kwai River that Saito wants built, he not only tackles the project with enthusiasm, he determines to build a better bridge than the Japanese themselves would have built. He doesn't regard what he's doing as traitorous; rather, he sees it as a way to keep his men busy and the bridge itself as a monument to their hard work while in captivity. One very interesting sidebar in the film is the contrast between Nicholson and Shears, and by implication, the British and American approach to war and life in captivity. Nicholson lives by certain codes and traditions and would rather die than violate them, even if they come to seem inexplicable in their practical results. Shears, on the other hand, is crafty and resourceful and doesn't give a damn about rules or regulations. He routinely bribes the guards to get out of performing physical labor. To him, the ends justify the means every time. He regards Nicholson and the other British officers as fools, and they regard him as a crazy American, gone slightly off his rocker from being a prisoner so long. Guinness gives one of his finest performances and deservedly won an Oscar (as did the movie itself, and the director, David Lean). The miserable conditions of the camp, and particularly the 'box' where Nicholson spends his solitary confinement, are very realistically presented; the unrelenting jungle heat is palpable. The characterizations are such that we are in sympathy with Colonel Nicholson, though we suspect he isn't completely rational, just as we come to dislike the character of Shears, even as we realize he is doing the right thing in blowing up the bridge. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is rightly regarded as a classic; I would say it is one of the ten best war movies ever made.",9,1,3,26 June 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," fantastic film-making; best Dracula ever
","This version of 'Dracula' is I feel the best ever. It really manages to present on the big screen what Bram Stoker's original vision probably was. It is scary, funny, erotic, lush and memorable. Francis Ford Coppola pulls out every cinematic trick in the book it seems to bring to life the story of a centuries old vampire who moves to London in search of fresh victims and a woman who apparently is the reincarnation of his long-dead wife. The movie is richly detailed and at the same time, fast-paced. The opening sequence, where Prince Vlad renounces God and attacks a sacred altar with his sword, is like a hammer-blow to the chest and sets the tone for the rest of the film. There is not a wasted second of celluloid in 'Dracula;' it is superbly written and visually striking, even breathtaking at times. Gary Oldman makes a moody and menacing Dracula, who adopts various guises throughout the movie. I suppose if I have one criticism, it is Oldman's speaking voice- he adopts an accent so thick he hardly seems to be speaking English at times, and making it even more difficult to understand is the halting, half-choked manner in which he speaks. I would say at least a third of his dialogue is virtually unintelligible. The surprise is that the movie does not really suffer because of this. It only adds to the overall atmosphere. Professor Van Helsing is portrayed with great gusto and playfulness by Anthony Hopkins, who's interpretation of the famous character suggests he's been driven about half-crazy by his pursuit of Dracula. Winona Ryder makes a fetching Mina/Elisabeta, and Keanu Reeves registers well as her fiancé and later husband Jonathan Harker, who's hair understandably turns grey after his experiences in Dracula's castle. The energy level of all the performances suggests the actors involved took great pleasure in their roles and the production. Coppola's direction is assured, almost never hitting a false note though he takes a great many risks. He has fun with the Dracula legend but never slips over the line into parody. You will find yourself smiling, laughing, and then cowering in your seat within the span of a few moments. We even get Dracula's trademark line, his equivalent of, 'Bond... James Bond.' Which of course is, 'I never drink... wine.' This is an absolutely awesome movie.",9,0,2,24 November 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," one of Ferrell's funniest
","Will Ferrell has played a number of different personality types during his amazingly busy career on television and in films, but the kind of character on display in 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is the one that most people associate with him and the one that seems to suit him best. The character is usually a celebrity of sorts, vain, boastful, utterly convinced of his sexual prowess, and not very intelligent. The old saying, 'a mile wide and an inch deep' would apply. In 'Anchorman,' all of these characteristics are brought forth and the film is almost a perfect vehicle for Ferrell and his wildly inventive comedic style. Since so many news anchors, particularly local ones, are suspected of being very similar to Ron Burgundy, it's not a stretch to accept such an absurd characterization. What seems to have gone unnoticed by many people, including the critics, is how similar the Ron Burgundy persona is to Chevy Chase's, back in his TV and film heyday. To say Ferrell is channeling Chase would almost be an understatement; the two are practically identical at times, with very similar delivery, choice of material and dialogue, and senses of the absurd. One can easily picture 'Anchorman' being made thirty years earlier with Chevy Chase in the title role. As with most screwball comedies of this nature, the 'plot' is really nothing more than an excuse to hang funny scenes on. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is hired by a San Diego TV station back in the '70's and hopes to become the first 'anchorwoman.' This causes much consternation among the 'boy's club' in place at the station, which consists of Ron Burgundy, reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sportscaster 'Champ Kind' (David Koechner). They and the rest of the supporting cast each have their moments, but it's fair to say this was Carell's breakout role and he steals several scenes that he's in, his mentally-challenged character providing some of the film's most inspired lunacy. 'Anchorman' was written by Ferrell and director Adam McKay, and much of the dialogue has since passed into the modern lexicon, with such terms and phrases as 'jazz flute' and 'I love lamp' instantly recognizable as being from the film. Will Ferrell, like most comedians, has his devotees and his detractors; if you count yourself among the former, you will find 'Anchorman' a laugh-out-loud experience almost from start to finish.",8,1,1,8 December 2007
Jaws," the summer of '75
","Like 'Jurassic Park,' 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' and 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' was clearly the movie of the moment when it came out in the summer of '75, and it began a string of blockbusters by Steven Spielberg that pretty much continues to present day. All the familiar elements and themes that people love (and hate) about Spielberg are present, though some are more muted and underplayed than they would be in later films by the director. Perhaps he didn't feel he had as free a hand to indulge himself as he would later. As everyone on the planet has seen 'Jaws,' there's no point in recounting the plot. So instead, just a few observations. Roy Scheider died recently, and as almost inevitably happens, we tend to look at his performance a little differently now, with a touch of nostalgia and melancholy. He really was good in this, the Everyman we could all relate to. A decent guy in over his head, scared, not terribly intelligent but not stupid either, with the added ironic trait of being afraid of the water, and someone who ultimately becomes somewhat heroic, though not intentionally. He reacts the way we hope we would in a crisis where we're frightened out of our wits, but from somewhere inside ourselves we find the courage or fortitude or blind luck to do the right thing and save the day. Richard Dreyfuss has a star-making role as the shark expert Hooper. His character and performance are what date the movie more than anything; he has '70's yuppie written all over him and is the prototypical Spielberg male lead. Hooper embodies all the things that Spielberg seems to find so appealing: he is clever, funny, childish, emotive, silly, put-upon, but, like Scheider's Chief Brody, more resourceful than he gives himself credit for. Hooper is the man-child that inhabits so many of the director's movies (Dreyfuss would go on to star in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'), and that most of the audience roots for and finds very entertaining. And Robert Shaw has the plum role, the scene-stealing turn as Quint, who is part Captain Ahab and part Popeye. In one of his best scenes, where the boat is being prepared for the shark hunt, Shaw keeps up a steady stream of seafaring prattle, almost gibberish, that is very funny and perfectly in character. Later, when he recounts his harrowing experience as a crewmember of the USS Indianapolis in World War II, and the desperate fear of floating helplessly in shark-infested waters waiting to be rescued, you can't take your eyes off him. (Spielberg says Shaw came up with much of the dialogue in this scene.) Quint has a kind of modified respect for Brody, but none for Hooper, whom he gives unholy hell all through the movie. 'Jaws' is one of those films that takes you back to wherever you were the first time you saw it. And for a couple of hours, it's 1975 all over again, right down to the leisure suits.",9,3,7,20 March 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," a few thoughts on a classic
","One of the things that strikes me whenever I watch 'Silence of the Lambs' again is how different Jodie Foster looks at various points in the movie. I don't know if this is deliberate or just the way her face comes across when filmed from different angles and with different lighting. At the risk of sounding as though I'm only focusing on her physical appearance, she sometimes appears radiantly beautiful, other times cute in a tomboy-ish way, and sometimes downright unattractive. I mention this because there are a number of quirky details in 'Silence of the Lambs' that one only picks up on with repeated viewings, and they all fall together in such a casual, unforced way that it's easy to believe they just happened. But no film turns out this well by accident. The director, Jonathan Demme, might have gotten lucky with one or two shots but I have to believe nearly everything in this movie was calculated to create the exact effect each renders. Anthony Hopkins had, prior to 'Lambs,' never been a favorite actor of mine. I was never particularly impressed with him in any role. In fact, it would be hard to think of one part that Hopkins was really identified with. But if ever the actor and the character and the moment came together in perfect realization, it was in this film. Hopkins grasps the complexities of Hannibal Lecter and presents them in such a way that it is now impossible to think of one and not the other. Just as Thomas Harris does in his books, Lecter is on film depicted as a cannibalistic madman but so much more than that; he is polite, resourceful, intolerant of most other criminals, tasteful, sophisticated... not to mention a genius. Given what Hannibal has done in the past and has every intention of doing in the future, his character would seem the most unlikely to appear even slightly sympathetic to the audience. And yet he does. Clarice Starling is a more straightforward character, easier to figure out, but Jodie Foster embodies her in a similar way. She is single-minded, on an almost holy quest to achieve success as an FBI agent, to rescue the helpless and imprison the guilty. She pushes herself relentlessly though Starling is not typically reflective unless forced into it by Lecter. When he tells her during their first meeting, 'You're so ambitious, aren't you?', he has her nailed, dead to rights. Over the course of the film, Hannibal Lecter begins to display other qualities that almost qualify as superhuman. He is immensely strong. He can apparently control and manipulate his body's functions to create false readings. He seems at times capable of both telepathy and empathy. Nothing supernatural is suggested, only such finely-honed skills of observation and reasoning that not even the smallest detail escapes his notice. And most importantly, he never fails at anything he sets out to do. By the end of the film, one is convinced Lecter could have escaped from that jail cell anytime he wanted. In fact, his escape from the cage in Memphis is so improbable that in retrospect it borders on magic. For everything to have happened in the order it did and with the precise timing it needed to happen beggars belief, to say the least. And yet it is so well-staged, and we are so convinced by this point that Hannibal is perfectly capable of pulling it off, the audience never questions it.",10,1,2,15 January 2008
Casino Royale," newly calibrated Bond is a good thing
","The latest re-launch of the James Bond series is the most radical departure from the established formula yet, which is a good thing. There are just enough references to the old franchise (a line of dialogue here and there, a couple of familiar characters, snippets of the old theme played occasionally) to assure us that this is indeed a 007 film. Apparently, though, all we really need to accept a movie as an entry in the Bond series is a main character who is a secret agent for the British government. 'Casino Royale' is a tough, realistically violent flick that makes all the previous Bonds seem positively cartoonish by comparison. When 007 is tortured, he's not strapped to a table fully clothed with a less-than-convincing laser beam inching its way toward him; here he's stripped naked and bound to a chair with the bottom cut out, then a man with a knotted rope proceeds to whack the hell out of him right between the legs, if you know what I mean. Daniel Craig's 007 has less in common with any of his predecessors than he does with the Robert Shaw character in 'From Russia With Love.' That is, he is a killing machine, remorseless, at times practically invincible. From the blows, knife wounds, torture, and poison he is subjected to, one is surprised he can even walk during the last third of the film, much less give chase and do battle with the bad guys yet again. He can affect a sophisticated air when necessary (like Shaw's character) and he is extremely intelligent and perceptive: a brute with a brain. But where it was clear with the other Bonds what motivated them to do this kind of work (the perks, the women, ego), one is never quite sure what motivates Daniel Craig's Bond. One suspects at times he is a masochist. He certainly gets precious little respect or encouragement from M (Judi Dench, the only carryover from the Brosnan films), which I suppose is in keeping with M's character from the time of Bernard Lee. Dench's M is a real bitch though which for obvious reasons Lee never could be. And there is the briefest of passing meetings with Felix Leiter of the CIA. Although it serves useful to the plot, one wonders why they bothered; perhaps to keep the connection alive for future episodes. The one section of 'Casino Royale' that feels unnatural is when 007 apparently falls in love with the latest 'Bond Girl,' Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) and resigns from MI-6 to be with her. Is it a ruse? It certainly is on HER part, as she betrays him and tries to get away with millions of pounds he thought he'd recovered for the British Treasury. She dies in Bond's arms and his grief seems genuine. Perhaps this is meant to establish his reluctance in the future to 'prolonged' relationships. So the latest re-boot of the 007 franchise is a successful one and should inject the nearly 50-year-old series with enough fresh energy to keep it going for a while.",8,1,4,6 February 2009
The Sixth Sense," the ultimate twist ending
","This might be the spoiler to beat all spoilers- Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), one of the two main characters in 'The Sixth Sense,' is actually dead through most of the movie and the audience doesn't know it. Thanks to an extremely clever and manipulative plot and a spectacularly successful twist ending, most people ended up going back to see 'The Sixth Sense' a second time, just to pick up all the 'clues' they missed the first time, and which are indeed there for anyone to see. The thing is, hardly anyone does. The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough success, grossing over $600 million worldwide (all those second and third viewings helped big-time) and one wonders if it wasn't at least partially a fluke. With the exception of 'Signs,' none of his other films has been a success, either critically or at the box office. The approach that worked so well in 'Sixth Sense' does not appear to be readily transferable to other material. But 'Sixth Sense' is a certifiable masterpiece of horror and suspense. It benefits greatly from young Haley Joel Osment's totally believable performance as Cole Sear, the nine-year-old boy who 'sees dead people.' The state of anxiety and fear he lives in is transmitted to the audience beyond the point of feeling sympathy for him; we actually come to feel the emotions he feels. No one except Cole can see the dead, but Shyamalan does not resort to trickery or suggestion in this regard: the deceased are right out in the open for the audience to see. One might think this would be the film's fatal flaw. It is certainly audacious. At one point in 'Sixth Sense,' when Dr. Crowe asks Cole if there are any dead persons present, the boy says there are, and sure enough, in the background are three gruesomely made-up figures hanging from the rafters. Similarly, later on, when a cyclist is killed in an accident and Cole and his mother are stuck in traffic as a result, the dead cyclist is shown standing right outside their car, peering in the passenger window. Cole's expression seems to be one of 'here we go again,' and is almost grimly humorous. But it all works and somehow proves to be very frightening. This straightforward approach to things that are usually only hinted at or seen in fleeting glimpses (one might contrast this with the first 'Alien' film, where the creature is never fully seen till the very end) turns out to be quite refreshing and most effective. Bruce Willis underplays his character, which is essential for the ending to work. Throughout the film, we are led to believe that his marriage is at the end of its rope, and that his wife's refusal to speak to him or even acknowledge him is simply a manifestation of that fact. All of this is masterfully played out and when at the climax, we learn his wife has never answered him because he hasn't been there, it comes as a complete shock. If AFI ever does a list of '100 Greatest Surprise Endings,' 'The Sixth Sense' will surely top the list.",8,4,7,6 January 2008
Rear Window," Hitchcock gets us again
","Alfred Hitchcock certainly lives up to his 'master of suspense' billing with 'Rear Window,' as it is one of the most suspenseful movies ever made. It's also probably the ultimate 'talk back to the screen' film. About a third of the way through till the end, you'll find yourself thinking and maybe even saying out loud, 'Oh no!' and 'don't go in there!' and 'hurry before he gets back!' etc. So it's great fun to watch, a real nail-biter. The entire film takes place on one elaborately built set, the back of a four-sided, four-story apartment complex with a small courtyard in the middle. Watching 'Rear Window' is like watching a stage play albeit on a stage like no other. Everyone, apparently, can see into everyone else's apartment when the windows are left open, which they obligingly are, most of the time. This would seem to stretch credulity to the breaking point, since everyone is apparently just as oblivious to being watched, but one accepts it as crucial to the plot and after a certain point it hardly seems to matter. James Stewart stars as a man confined to his apartment in a wheelchair for several weeks due to a broken leg, and takes to, well, spying on his neighbors. What begins as a way to fend off boredom soon becomes an obsession. There is the newlywed couple (the only ones who typically have their shades drawn); a songwriter who plays his piano a lot; a single woman Stewart dubs 'Miss Lonely Hearts' because she imagines having suitors over for dinner; a gorgeous blonde who is forever doing exercises and dancing; another couple that sleep out on their stoop every night; and most importantly, a man (Raymond Burr) and his nagging wife. Stewart becomes convinced, after the wife disappears, that Burr has killed her and disposed of her body. Grace Kelly plays Stewart's girlfriend and Thelma Ritter, an insurance company nurse who checks in on him regularly. They are both skeptical at first of his theory but soon are drawn into it and become as obsessed as he is. I don't normally issue 'spoiler alerts' even though I'm always giving the end away, but since the build-up in 'Rear Window' is so crucial, I will this time. The only time I was disappointed in this film was at the very end. I was expecting some sort of twist or surprise ending, and the denouement when it came was no surprise at all, except perhaps in that it wasn't a surprise. Maybe that was the point. Frankly, I tended to agree with the police officer who occasionally dropped by Stewart's apartment to discuss the matter and ended up pooh-poohing most of Stewart's notions. All through the movie, Stewart's character reminded me of a conspiracy buff... one of those people who is convinced men didn't really land on the moon or someone other than Oswald killed JFK. Or in this case, is convinced through a lot of circumstantial evidence, some of it very questionable, that his neighbor killed his wife. But as I said, maybe that's the point, because the evidence Stewart sees is what keeps us in suspense for two hours. Is he right or is this just a bored man's wild imagination working overtime and a half? It's fun to conjecture the latter is true, even if the former was the correct assumption all along.",8,0,1,2 March 2008
Apollo 13," Hollywood re-telling at its best
","The great thing about 'Apollo 13' is that it tells a true story essentially as it happened, one that most people over a certain age are at least somewhat familiar, a story of which everyone knows the ending, and yet makes it as fresh and exciting and even tear-jerking as if the idea had just popped out of some talented screenwriter's head. It is no small achievement that the movie takes stiff real-life dialogue and even some lame 'true' jokes and by sheer screen presence and charisma of its stars again makes all of it sparkle, not to mention the traumatic scenes in space of the crippled spacecraft as it wobbles its way back to Earth. It is fair to say 'Apollo 13' makes its story much more exciting than it seemed in real life, which somehow just doesn't seem right, but which feels like an unimportant thing to worry about while you're watching it. Part of this success I think is due to the fact that most of us really DON'T (or didn't) know the whole story of what happened on this space flight. I know I was shocked to realize just how badly the spacecraft was damaged in the initial explosion; one whole side was ripped away. Given what the astronauts and NASA had to work with at the time in terms of technology, and witnessing as we have even greater tragedies since with the space shuttle, it really is nothing less than a miracle the three men made it back to Earth safely. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon are all fine as the astronauts; each gets to be heroic at various points in the film though there is subtle stereotyping: Hanks as Commander Jim Lovell is level-headed, compassionate, almost too good to be true (the film is based on Lovell's book); Paxton's Fred Haise is quite ill during much of the flight and puts up a brave front but, well, he's no Lovell; and Bacon portrays Jack Swigert, who garners nearly everyone's resentment as a hotshot young pilot, a last-minute replacement for the more respected Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise). Back on the ground in Mission Control, Ed Harris is wonderful to watch as Flight Director Gene Kranz, and 'director' is a good description of his role- he orchestrates the rescue effort, cool, determined, confident. The scenes in space are quite convincing, many of them shot in weightlessness, and convey believably the crisis which faced the crew and their counterparts on Earth. I didn't realize how good a film 'Apollo 13' was until I watched it the other night for the first time in about five years. It is an uncommon example of Hollywood telling a 'true story' and getting it right.",9,2,3,4 January 2009
Gladiator," entertaining Roman epic
","Aside from its graphic violence, 'Gladiator' is quite the old-fashioned movie; you may even feel you've seen more or less the same story many times before. The plot certainly seems right out of Roman Film Epics 101 as all the reliable ingredients are there. Credit director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe for making the familiar appear so fresh again, crafting an intriguing if not exactly mesmerizing film, winning five Academy Awards including for picture and actor and achieving great popular success at the box office. Perhaps enough time had passed for a really good gladiator flick to click with audiences, or perhaps today's crowd has never seen 'Spartacus' or some of the others. For whatever reason, they turned out in droves to see 'Gladiator,' just as the people of Rome turn out to see Crowe's Maximus defeat foe after foe in the arena. Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the 'last good emperor' of Rome, chooses Maximus to be his successor over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The son discovers this and kills his father before the succession can be announced and proclaims himself emperor. (Already, you can see where this is going.) Commodus of course is a weak figure, full of despicable traits, including having the hots for his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). All sorts of conflicts and political intrigue ensue before finally, Maximus and Commodus meet in the arena for a death match. Guess who wins, despite having been mortally wounded just prior to the contest. 'Gladiator' may be the most 'mainstream' film Ridley Scott has ever directed, very straightforward in its storytelling and without as many quirky touches as most of his other movies. Crowe, Phoenix, Harris, and Nielsen all deliver good performances, Crowe in particular winning the audience over, again, just as Maximus does in the movie itself. While there is nothing really remarkable about 'Gladiator,' it is solid entertainment and does not seem nearly as long as its running time suggests, which is always a good thing.",7,1,2,8 February 2009
Back to the Future," fast blast back to the '50s
","'Back to the Future' was hugely successful, mainly with teens and mainly because it ties in to their hang-ups, angst, and fantasies. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) deals with them all as teens only wish they could, jumping on a skateboard when things get too sticky, outsmarting the bully, and zipping through time in a REALLY souped-up Delorean. Fox doesn't so much act as hyperventilate his way through the film; he is constantly on the move, frenetic and frantic, forever running to or from one thing or the other, and shouting 'Doc!' a lot. His energy level is admirable, even though I got tired just watching him. This is precisely what teenagers, particularly teen boys, empathize with so deeply in this movie. The best solution to any problem is to not stand still. Run like hell and maybe something will come to you. The film's script is clever and in keeping with Fox's performance, really over-the-top and unashamedly silly at times. With the help of Christopher Lloyd's goofily eccentric Doc Brown, he travels back in time to 1955 and meets his own parents, before they were married. There are a number of nifty twists and turns in the time-travel plot, and the other characters are very well-cast. Crispin Glover does a great job as Marty's dim-bulb father George as does Lea Thompson, portraying Lorraine, his mother. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty back in the '50s (obviously not knowing who he is, or will be) and one of several problems Marty faces is making sure that she and George end up together. Glover and Thompson, along with Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, the bully, actually outshine Fox's breathless portrayal and Lloyd's incessant mugging. The gags and situations are sometimes obvious but have a good batting average; upon learning from Marty that the president in 1985 is Ronald Reagan, the 1955 Doc Brown says, quite understandably, 'Ronald Reagan? The actor? Who's the vice-president... Jerry Lewis?' There is also an entertaining sequence at a high school dance where Marty and a back-up band perform a freaked-out, almost 'metal' version of 'Johnny B. Goode.' The film even takes it a step further, having Marvin Berry (Chuck's cousin) call him in the middle of the performance to let him listen, making the almost blasphemous suggestion that this is what gave Chuck Berry the impetus to create rock and roll! 'Back to the Future' is so good-natured, though, that it gets away with this as well as Lorraine's flirtation with Marty. Fox and the film are sufficiently likable that it all seems harmless, which it is. Two popular sequels followed, but they lack the charm and upbeat feeling of the first movie, a frenzied fun-ride through time.",7,0,1,16 April 2008
Goodfellas," what a ride
","'Goodfellas' could be described as ''The Godfather' on speed,' but that wouldn't really be accurate. The two movies are very different. The mobsters in 'Godfather' are dignified by comparison. Those in 'Goodfellas' have practically been driven mad by power, money, and eventually, dope. At least one of them, Joe Pesci's Tommy, is quite literally insane. The film moves at a lightning pace, narration provided by the character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco.) We see what takes places through Henry's (and to lesser degree, Karen's) descriptions, though it plays out right in front of us as well. Robert De Niro plays Jimmy, a charismatic gangster who is part of the mob but also something of a free agent; he can never be 'made' (the ultimate distinction the crime family can bestow on a member) because of his Irish roots. The same goes for Henry. He earns his place in the mob by starting at an early age as an errand boy willing to do anything, which endears him to the mob and their boss, Paulie. The violence in 'Goodfellas' is all the more appalling because for the most part, it is so casually administered. Tommy, for example, will kill anyone for the slightest perceived insult, with no more thought or regret than he would have ordering a drink. People are routinely beaten up savagely if they get crossways with any of the mob figures. But there is much more to the film than that, and I should point out there's a great deal of humor in the film, some of it laugh-out-loud funny. At times, it's like the most twisted comedy you've ever seen. 'Goodfellas' also shows how this 'community' of criminals and their families live; it takes place in and around New York City for the most part. Not surprisingly, it is a very tightly-knit group. Once Karen marries Henry, she has no contacts or life outside the extended 'family.' All of her female friends are wives of other mobsters. Birthdays, weddings, holidays... these are only shared with family insiders. This quirky little subculture has its own rules, standards and perks. For instance, there is one night a week designated for the men to take their mistresses out for drinks at a nightclub. Serving a prison term is accepted with a shrug; it seems almost all the men have served time at one point or another. Henry's first prison stint gets him congratulations from the others. It's like a badge of honor or a rite of passage. The lifestyle is very fast-paced, almost maniacally so. Everyone the mobsters deal with is paid off with wads of cash: cops, delivery boys, waiters, prison guards, you name it. Every gangster in the family carries with him a roll of hundreds (occasionally twenties); I've never seen so much currency exchange hands so frequently as in 'Goodfellas.' Eventually, despite Paulie's prohibition against it, several of the men including Henry begin dealing in drugs, specifically cocaine, which he and Karen are soon hooked on. The final scenes show a paranoid, out of control Henry totally wired from the coke, backed into a corner, the only way out being to turn government informant and enter the witness protection program. Turns out old Don Corleone, in that very different film 'The Godfather,' was right. Drugs did end up destroying the mob to a large degree. 'Goodfellas' shows that, but what an insane thrill ride it must have been... like a roller-coaster going a thousand miles an hour straight down into hell.",9,0,0,12 July 2008
The Birds," no explanations
","'The Birds' finds Alfred Hitchcock at the end, and at a peak, of a most productive and impressive run of films, which for most people began with 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' in 1934 and continued through to 'The Birds' in 1963. There were Hitchcock films before and after, of course, but for this thirty-year period, he averaged a film a year with very few duds. 'The Birds' is full of Hitchcockian touches and is a genuinely disturbing film. Not for the first time, the director lulls us into thinking we are watching a perfectly ordinary, one might even say pedestrian, comedy/drama; this time about a lawyer/playboy (Rod Taylor) and a rich society playgirl (Tippi Hedren) and the flirtatious back-and-forths of their budding relationship. You know, she can't stand him so she finds any excuse to see him, etc. The other main characters are the lawyer's possessive mother (Hitchcock did have a thing for possessive mothers), his annoying little sister, and an old flame (played by a young Suzanne Pleshette). Early on in the film, the birds themselves only intrude on this little soap opera at odd moments, just enough to make the audience go 'hmm.' But soon they are the focal point after a series of attacks in the California coastal community of Bodega Bay cannot be explained. And this is precisely where Hitchcock plays 'gotcha' with the audience. At no point in the movie is there even a hint of a logical reason for the bird attacks... the 'why' that people so desperately want and need to know when faced with a crisis beyond comprehension. The characters in the film become pawns of sorts to the madness, as incapable as the audience of understanding what's happening. They are also incapable of defending themselves. (It never occurs to anyone, even at the end, to get some shotguns and shoot the little bastards.) The juxtaposition of the humdrum with the carnage of the bird attacks is jolting at times. In perhaps the most sadistically brilliant scene, the domineering mother drives alone to a neighbor's farm to find it deserted. As she walks through the farmhouse, it appears largely undisturbed at first, only small tell-tale signs present themselves... a cracked wall hanging here, a feather there. Then she comes across the farmer, slumped to the floor in pajamas, and in a series of quick-cut close-ups, we see his bloody eye sockets where his eyes have been pecked out. The special effects themselves are variable, from quite believable (the above-mentioned scene) to almost laughably phony. Hitchcock films are notorious in this regard (see his next film, 'Marnie,' with the painted backdrop of a battleship in the final scene) and it's hard to know if this is intentional or not. The famous director did have a wicked sense of humor. Most horror films concern characters who are unalterably caught up with the terrifying forces that menace them. In 'The Birds,' the characters try their best to ignore them, to no avail.",8,1,2,31 January 2008
Jurassic Park," not a fan
","I've seen Jurassic Park probably five or six times, and each time I hope I'll like it better than the last, and I never do. A perfectly wonderful book by Michael Crichton is given the 'Spielberg' treatment and aside from the wonderful special effects, betrayed badly.Where to begin? First and foremost, one of Spielberg's worst tendencies is to find annoying personal characteristics endearing. The two children aren't precocious and charming, they're little brats, no matter how hard the director tries to paint them otherwise. The character of John Hammond, in the book, was as I recall a rather devious, unscrupulous man; here, he is portrayed as a cheerful, slightly ditsy, misguided Santa Claus. And Laura Dern manages to almost single-handedly sink this movie. Her perpetual 'I don't know whether to laugh or cry' expression is probably the single most irritating element in a film full of them. And everyone smiles WAY too much.Spielberg, for all his supposed genius, also delivers some of the most excruciating action and danger scenes on record. Whenever one of the human characters is in a spot, it is inevitably his or her own stupid fault. They can't lock the door, they won't turn the flashlight off, they're too scared to jump off the fence, they can't run fast enough... every damn scene is like this, to where you want to reach into the screen and slap the hell out of them.Sam Neill comes off best, in what is really a thankless role as the straight man for all this nonsense. But he's dragged down by the same sappy script.Well, what about those special effects, you might ask? Yes, the dinosaurs are spectacular and very believable (much more so than the humans really) and they are the only reason I'm giving this four stars out of ten. In 1993, we were still being blown away by filmmakers constantly upping the ante when it came to mind-blowing effects and sure enough, Jurassic Park was state-of-the-art when it came out. Since then, I daresay people have become more blase about such things as they have become more routine.To be fair, there are some wonderful sequences in Jurassic Park and it's certainly worth seeing at least once. I suppose ultimately that is the most maddening thing about it; it could have been so much better, not just another summer blockbuster, but a truly great motion picture. It's a real shame that it's not.",4,25,53,27 October 2007
Valkyrie," compelling film about plot to kill Hitler
","'Valkyrie' made me think of 'Apollo 13' in the sense that both are about true stories most people have heard about but whose details remained obscure, and thus make the stories worth telling, even though the endings are never in doubt. In the case of 'Valkyrie,' Tom Cruise and a supporting cast largely made up of British actors take us through the fascinating tale of the last documented attempt to kill Adolf Hitler (there were fifteen altogether), and the intricate plan to seize the German government, disable the dreaded SS, and negotiate an end to World War II. Unless one is a student of the war, chances are you've only heard a fragment or two of the whole story; many might think a German officer placed a briefcase with a bomb in it next to Hitler at a meeting and that was it. But as we find out in 'Valkyrie,' there was much more to the scheme and it came tantalizingly close to succeeding. The only real problem was that Hitler wasn't killed by the blast. Many of Germany's top generals had serious doubts about Hitler's military strategy, particularly toward the end of the war, but there had been resistance movements against Hitler since the late thirties, with a changing roster of conspirators. 'Valkyrie' details the last one, spearheaded by Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg (Cruise). The other major players, mostly generals, varied in their degrees of commitment to the plot. Some were adamant in their hatred of Hitler and demanded he be killed; others wavered back and forth, obviously in fear for their lives and their families if the plot failed and they were discovered. The more insistent ones, like Stauffenberg, pushed the plan forward and at times bullied their more reticent comrades into taking action. This is all presented in a very straightforward fashion. 'Valkyrie' reminds one of nothing so much as a very good WW2/espionage film made at the time. The script is tight and well-drawn, the actors uniformly believable. Cruise himself is somewhat subdued compared to other roles he's played, which is the right approach here. The thing that will strike many viewers as most surprising is how far the scheme got. After the bomb explodes during a meeting where Hitler is present, the conspirators waste no time in rounding up SS officers and phoning German commanders in the field to notify them of Hitler's death and the change in government. For a while, it works and there is surprisingly little resistance to what is in effect a coup. Eventually though, Hitler's voice is heard in a telephone call to Berlin, and that is the end of it. Needless to say, the conspirators are nearly all killed, as well as many others who had nothing to do with the plot. Such was the kind of vengeance practiced in Hitler's Germany.",7,1,2,21 May 2009
The Godfather," musings on a classic
","A few thoughts and observations on an American classic- I doubt 'The Godfather' was shot sequentially (hardly any movies are) but it sure seems to me that the first scene, the wedding scene, was also the first one filmed. The reason I say this is that none of the actors seem completely comfortable with their characters yet; it's as though they're still figuring them out, unlike later in the film, where almost all the actors absolutely inhabit their roles. The same goes for the direction and dialogue, which contains some heavy-handed exposition that is noticeably missing later on too. (Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen tells his wife at one point that he has to go back to work because no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. Oh really? His wife never knew this? She's finding out just now, in the middle of the festivities?) As Sonny, James Caan is still working on his swagger, and even Marlon Brando is shown at his desk, holding a cat and stroking it, as though he's auditioning to be the next James Bond villain. (There are no further shots of him holding a cat.) This early awkwardness soon passes but the next scene is just as confounding, in a different way. Hagen is sent to California to convince a Hollywood producer to give a movie role to Johnny Fontaine, Don Corleone's godson. This scene sticks out like a sore thumb now and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, despite providing 'The Godfather' with one of its most famous images, that of the severed horse-head in the movie producer's bed. No, it's only when Hagen returns to New York that the film really begins. The first several times I saw 'The Godfather,' I had a difficult time breaking it down into segments and sections, as in what happened in relation to other things going on in the film. This of course is the sign of smart scripting and directorial slight-of-hand, and clever pacing which keeps you guessing. For instance, the different scenes where Luca Brazi is killed, then Don Corleone is shot, Tom Hagen is briefly kidnapped by Sallozzo, and Michael Corleone finds out what has happened. These all seem to happen at roughly the same time, but Michael finds out from a newspaper! Yet one never questions it while watching. There are so many great and famous scenes, it's hard to pick favorites, but I notice now when I watch it, I particularly enjoy the one where Don Corleone and his inner circle meet with Sallozzo, just before the aforementioned violence. It's one of the few times in the lengthy film where we actually get to see the Don at work guiding his empire and making decisions. Not a great deal happens in the scene, but it's a good example of Don Corleone's thinking and helps explain why he is held in such high regard, why he is in fact the 'irreplaceable man', as will soon become apparent. Sonny is obviously to be his successor, and just as obviously lacks the old man's reasoning and negotiating skills. Fredo is just another body in the room and Michael isn't yet 'with' them. Despite the incredible wealth and influence we've seen the Corleone family possess, this scene and its immediate aftermath show just how fragile and tenuous its grip on power is in dangerous circumstances. The relative ease with which the Don is set up and shot, as well as the quick dispensing of his main hit-man, Luca Brazi (who had been portrayed as almost invincible), proves that Sallozzo was correct, in the short term anyway: get rid of the Don and his empire collapses into confusion. The rest of the film is more or less the laying out of a careful and methodical revenge plotted by both Michael and the old Don, following a major subplot having to do with Michael hiding out in Sicily after killing Sallozzo and a New York police captain. It all leads to perhaps the most famous scene of all in 'The Godfather,' the baptism sequence where everyone who plotted against the Corleones get their comeuppance, from Connie's husband Carlo to the rival Mafia chieftains who hoped to exploit the Corleone family's momentary weakness. That it feels like justice being served says something about how Coppola has successfully manipulated the audience into rooting for the Corleones. The word 'adventure' doesn't usually come to mind when discussing 'The Godfather,' but that's what it is, an astonishing adventure for the characters and an eye-opening look inside a powerful crime family for the audience.",10,2,5,20 May 2008
