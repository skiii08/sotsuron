Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you liked DUNE, you'll probably like this
","This movie seems to fall victim to one of the most common Sci-Fi maladies. Essentially, the drama and character development are absent to make room for loads of bells and whistles.Maybe I'm being unfair, since I actually enjoyed the visual aspects of the film and the action sequences. I wish that this movie had been more like The Empire Strikes Back instead of trying to miraculously resolve all of the conflicts at once in the last ten minutes. It's very unsatisfying. Did they simply replace Ewoks with Lizards. Yup. If I were under 12, this probably would have been my favorite movie ever (as A New Hope once was).The fundamental problem - most people expected way too much from this movie.If you had no complaints about the rampant inconsistencies in DUNE, the nonexistent character delevopment, and general betrayal of every satisfying quality in a story for an intriguing visual experience, then I unreservedly recommend The Phantom Menace to you.",5,0,1,12 June 1999
