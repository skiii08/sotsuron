"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Great Film!
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. While looking incredibly bizarre, it somehow feels more real than any movie you could imagine - at least here, in America. The person who designed the costumes was obviously a genius, but the actors, the dialog, and the entire story are also superb. I think more imagination went into this than into the entire Hollywood catalog of films, which is probably not saying a lot, but believe me - it's very very original. Needless to say, I'm giving it a 10.",4,2,9,8 December 1998
The Graduate," average
",I thought the only good part was the music by Simon and Garfunkel. Otherwise it's a pretty average film.,5,5,12,8 December 1998
