Requiem for a Dream," Metaphors a plenty, but where's the story???
","This movie disappointed.  The characters lacked depth and the events were entirely predictable.  They did not grow, unless the ending frames of the cast in fetal positions is supposed to mean something.
Also, ECT is never used in cases addiction recovery, and its brutal portrayal in this film was for affect only.I loved Pi, but the director must move beyond film school effects and prove his talent.",3,3,7,10 June 2001
