Gremlins," Pretty Funny Stuff Here!
","I saw this movie for the first time in theaters when I was in like 2nd grade. I remember thinking how scary it seemed up front, but all in all this was a entertaining film. The bar scene still makes me laugh to this day, especially the gremlin that is playing with the puppets. It was kind of great to have them all in the theater at the end of the show watching Snow White. Corey Feldman did an okay turn in this one. Phoebe Cates is hot!! All in all, the makers of the film did a great job with the effects and the robotic and puppet work for the gremlins and mogwai. The old Chinese man is scary with those weird looking eyeballs. The scene in the house is pretty funny, too. The mean old lady with all those cats. Great movie!",7,0,1,11 February 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Will Ferrell is brilliant!
",This movie shows why Will Ferrell gets the attention he deserves. It was hilarious. Paul Rudd pulls off a funny performance showing his comedic acting well established in Wet Hot American Summer. I loved this movie and will continue to look for more films with Will Ferrell. The list of cameos in here adds to the overall enjoyment level of the film. Vince Vaughn continues to impress me the more I see him in comedies. Some of the scenes are a little hokey like the dream/sex sequence. Steve Carrell is great. Chris Parnell is great in a supporting role. Fred Willard continues to answer the bill in no matter what role he is asked to play. I loved this film and would recommend it to anyone!!!,10,1,3,7 February 2005
