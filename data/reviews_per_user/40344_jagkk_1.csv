The Rock," Don't listen to these reviews
","This is one of the greatest action movies of all time. It has it all - heartbreak, explosions, a quasi-villain who you aren't sure if you should root for or not, Sean Connery's vintage Scottish accent, and symphony music that rivals the original score from Star Wars: a New Hope. 10/10 for one of Michael Bay's greatest films of all time and my personal favorite action flick.",10,1,1,8 April 2020
