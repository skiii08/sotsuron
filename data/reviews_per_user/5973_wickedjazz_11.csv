Scarface," Not the best not the worst

Fight Club," The actual best
",One of brad pitt's finest. Ed Norton was odd casting for the time but he pulls this psychological thriller off well with some quirky and shocking moments,9,0,0,17 February 2019
The Fifth Element," Unpretentious

Home Alone," Mindless fun
",Silly acting but a great classic that I love watching during the Christmas break,7,1,2,18 February 2019
L.A. Confidential," Total A list

Snatch," Pure fun
","While the acting is a bit hit and miss, this film still kept me laughing and cringing the whole time. Brad Pitt is a standout",8,0,1,17 February 2019
Garden State," Enjoyable
",Was weird watching braff in this role after scrubs and I do feel he juggled too many hats and faultering for it. His characterization could have been better. Otherwise an enjoyable film,7,1,1,18 February 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Great
","If you love martial arts as much as I do and hot women weilding swords, this film is for you! The soundtrack is awesome",10,2,4,17 February 2019
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Average
",Very similar to the original. Not the best sequel but still watchable,6,1,1,18 February 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Mindless violence
",Tarantino could have done better. There's some heavy scenes here that were gratuitous without propelling the plot. Seemed like a reason to put A listers in a room together. Still- it's a genre I like so I watched it.,6,1,2,17 February 2019
Ice Age," Great animated film
",This film is where Pixar-style films made their dent in history. A modern day lion king that hasn't been bested so many years on,10,1,1,18 February 2019
