The Expendables 2," The worst mercenaries ever!
","Okay, this is not a serious movie. It's supposed to be 'bad'. Bad in a way that's funny which should mean it's still good. But to make a 'bad' movie funny you must actually have some finesse. And this movie doesn't have any of that. It tries to be funny in a stereotypically male fashion with grunts, lame jokes, extreme violence and dreadful portrayal of women. The only strong female character merely functions as an unattainable object for the others to project their sexual desires upon. With all the men in heat I'm surprised she didn't get raped?! The other women are either cheaters or weak women who tries but cannot fire a gun properly (like any man can).The whole idea behind this series is for old action movie stars to come together and have some fun. I somewhat enjoyed the first movie which was more successful. Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for both movies and also directed the first movie which might point the finger to the problem - director Simon West who fails to create anything coherent out of the script. The characters move from place to place where they instantly kill everyone and then move on. In between you get stale dialogue and poor attempts at humor and character interplay. Even the action isn't funny. While other movies have exciting action scenes that are well choreographed here it's just murder and mayhem.Now take 'Die hard' for example. Even though it's extremely unrealistic it's also smart. I was drawn into that movie and I believed everything that happened. 'The Expendables' is unrealistic and hopelessly stupid. It doesn't take a soldier to realize these guys couldn't make it as guns for hire. They're supposed to be the toughest and most capable - and sure they're successful! But they escape from tight spots by deliberately RUNNING INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. When the bad guys run into another room they RUN AFTER THEM. Without care! In case the bad guys unbeknownst to the heroes were waiting to kill them they would miraculously refrain from running. Makes sense?Sometimes I feel like there could be something there. Sylvester Stallone have the most lines and some of them are borderline funny. His character is the most interesting one. Too bad he gets so much screen time that by the end he just bores me. He's the best actor in this movie but he's not THAT good. And how many times can Arnold Schwarzenegger jokingly say 'I'll be back'? Seriously? I want to punch him in the face.By the way it seems there will be a third movie. God help us all.",2,0,3,4 May 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Good action but not much interest
","Here's another Mission impossible movie. Tom Cruise is trying SO hard to please the audience. And every time he seems to come up a little short. MI2 was just pathetic and MI3 suffers the same problem as Ghost protocol. See below! :) The action and the production in this movie is great. You can tell they put in a lot of time creating good action scenes that doesn't seem to stop. They just keep going and going and sometimes that's enough to make you say 'Jeeeeeesus Christ'! And there's plenty of good humor. Sometimes in one liners - mostly coming from Simon Peggs character Benji. But there's also some humor in the action scenes.But why bother? Most of the actors are good but not even Tom Cruise himself seems to be very inspired even though this is his pet project! The characters are just vehicles for the action and I don't really care about any of them. Even though they try to add a little depth with some story it never takes off.The action scenes are intense but they're always over the top. Sure this is mission impossible. But when everything is REALLY hard all the time, when EVERYTHING goes wrong, and the movie is REALLY exciting all the time but they somehow win anyway...you stop caring. There's very little holding this movie together. In fact, the action scenes are a bit like separate movies in themselves. They move from from one part of the world to the next where new action scenes takes place. And since the plot IS the actionthe movie becomes shattered!! It's a bit like James Bond. Or rathertries to be like James Bond. And even though I'm quite entertained for the moment it just doesn't add up. It's all a bit too polished. Ethan Hunt will never be James Bond who is truly a psychopath! A killer! A womanizer! A man with a dark mind and a sordid past. In comparison Ethan Hunt is nothing but a smiling do gooder who wants to save the world like the true boy scout he is.Also Mikael Nyqvist disappoints as the villain. I know him from Swedish movies and he talks!! He says his lines but he never acts... which is a pity! He's almost not in the picture anyway and you have to wonder about the motives of his character. His actions are incongruent and ultimately...completely pointless!I was entertained and I might watch Ghost Protocol again just for the hell of it. But it's no classic! With this kind of production I expect much more. 5/10 stars.",5,2,7,24 June 2012
