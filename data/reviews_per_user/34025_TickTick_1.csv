Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," DON'T LISTEN TO CRITICS!!!
","No matter what critics say, I personally enjoyed this movie a great deal. I loved the fast pace (which was one thing critics didn't like): the viewer doesn't have time to rest, to take a breath, and is therefore drawn into the action. The settings were gorgeous, the costumes breathtaking, and the battle scenes... well, they were pure Star Wars, through and through. The music, thanks to the brilliant John Williams, is of course magnificent (I have already bought the soundtrack and listen to it constantly). All of the actors did wonderfully, especially adorable Jake Lloyd (yet again, critics don't know what they are talking about!). It had everything that makes a Star Wars movie: action, adventure, drama, and heart, all wrapped up in a beautiful, fantastic world that pleases the eye and captures the imagination. Bravo to George Lucas!!!",9,0,0,23 May 1999
