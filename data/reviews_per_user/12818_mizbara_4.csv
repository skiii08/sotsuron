Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Had its moments
","I just re-watched 'The Phantom Menace' for the first time since it first came out. I came to several realizations (some bad, some good): 1. Regarding Jar Jar...he wasn't all that bad. There was just too much of him. Lucas should have either had less of him at the beginning or had him be more serious at the end. Also, since Jar Jar became such an important character, he probably should have been a little more serious than he was. After all, not all the Gugans (sp?) were like him. There were a few that the audience were shown that had more seriousness to their characters.2. The actor who played Anakin...what the hell were they thinking hiring him? I remember hating that actor's performance the first time I saw it, and nothing has changed. The kid had no chemistry with anyone he was acting with. I know that kid actors aren't supposed to be incredibly good, but with a character as important as Anakin, they should have tried harder to get a kid who was at least halfway decent. This kid was awful. He couldn't even say, 'Yippee!' without it sounding totally fake.3. The special effects...oy. They are awesome, however, it's hard to buy that this movie took place 30 years before Star Wars Episode IV. The technology they have looks much more advanced. They should have toned it down some, made it look more natural, and older than the technology from the previous trilogy.4. The other actors...they are awesome. They did as best they could, considering some of what they had to put up with. Their performances were enjoyable, and most of them interacted as well as they could. Unfortunately, every time they were in scenes with the kid who played Anakin, their scenes ended up being uneven, because that kid could not act.5. Yoda...I'm glad they still had the puppet Yoda in this one. I don't like the CGI Yoda in 'Attack of the Clones' (except for during the fight scene with Dooku). I think the puppet looks more natural than the CGI.6. Plot...this movie actually has a good plot, when you get past all the flashiness, CGI, and bad acting.This movie is not a total loss, though when compared to the earlier movies, it just doesn't hold its own. 'Attack of the Clones' was better, though there were problems with that one too. I am looking forward to 'Revenge of the Sith,' tentatively willing to venture hope that Lucas might actually make a prequel that holds its own with the first trilogy.",5,1,2,10 April 2005
Underworld," A victim of over-editing
","It took me a long time to see this movie, and when I did, I enjoyed it. However, much of the plot was lost in the action sequences. However, unlike many others of its genre, I felt the action scenes were not overly done. I loved the costumes, and thought they fit the dark, surreal atmosphere well. The sets were fantastic with the dark and gloominess needed for the vampire/werewolf storyline. The filming worked really well, almost keeping a feeling unreality about every shot.But I have to admit there were a lot of things I didn't quite understand or wanted more of. While the sequel answered many of those questions, I still felt something was missing. It was. I bought the unrated director's cut...and it is *WAY* better than the original. The missing scenes do a lot to fill in holes, especially Erika's motives. It's sad though that we had to wait for a 2-disc edition to fill those holes. But 'Underworld,' like many other films, looks like it fell victim to over-editing, losing many valuable plot points and character motivations along the way.If you haven't seen the director's cut or if you haven't seen 'Underworld' at all, I would recommend just skipping the original version, and going right to the director's cut. It'll make a lot more sense.",7,0,2,14 August 2006
Tombstone," Excellent Western!
","'Tombstone' is a gem of a movie. It has everything a good movie should have: action, drama, romance, and comedy. An all-star cast and good writing round it out to make it an awesome film.Kurt Russell did a good job starring as retired lawman Wyatt Earp. Along with scene-stealing Val Kilmer as the best on-screen Doc Holliday to date, the chemistry between those two was awesome. They played well off of one another, and showed a deep friendship between the two legends. Other notable performances include Michael Biehn as the contemptible gunfighter outlaw and rival to Doc Holliday, Johnny Ringo; Sam Elliot as Wyatt's older, more world-weary brother, Virgil; and Bill Paxton as Wyatt's light-hearted and more innocent brother, Morgan, whose best moment in the film came with Morgan's realization of what it felt like to really kill someone, even doing it to save Doc's life.Someone else mentioned that this movie is more 'popcorn' fair, as far as Westerns go. I don't agree. I think this movie, while not going as far as some, still manages to convey character depth, just more subtly, and I must admit, taking a back seat to much of the action. I have two complaints about this movie. One, some of the scenes were incredibly graphic. The opening sequence at the mission, designed to make the viewer despise the outlaw gang, The Cowboys, did a good job at that. But it was a little hard to take, as was the part after Doc shot Ringo. The camera angles were strange, and jarring to the eye. Two, the parts of the women in the film, aside from Josephine, were too small and not very developed. I would have liked to know more about Louisa and Allie, Virgil and Morgan's wives. But for all that, this movie is an excellent movie, and I would recommend it for anyone who likes Westerns.Note: the majority of this film was filmed at Old Tucson, a movie studio built in 1939. It's a place tourists can go. However, a fire nine years ago has changed what it looks like now, as opposed to then. But if you'd ever been there before 1995, you can recognize the places they filmed in Old Tucson!",9,0,1,12 July 2004
Sin City," Gorgeous Film
","With 'Sin City,' I didn't know anything about it. A friend of mine who's obsessed with Elijah Wood wanted to go see it. I told her I'd go see it with her, but I had no opinion about it either way. Then I saw a preview. Realized I *had* to go see this film, if no other reason than the beautiful cinematography. Well, I finally saw it. I loved this film.The cinematography was even more amazing than I thought it was going to be. I loved the use of the black-and-white. We just don't see enough of those anymore, and for a genre like film noir, black-and-white works well. However, it was taken a step further by the use of color in certain places, like Goldie's hair color, Dwight's car, the blood on Marv's face. These heightened the surrealness of the movie, along with the almost cartoonish look, like the first time Kevin's on the screen or Marv's bandages. This movie is stellar example of awesome cinematography! But that's not the only great thing...the music was perfect. Within the first minute or so of the opening credits, I knew I had to buy the soundtrack. The music perfectly accentuated the movie, which is what good scores are supposed to do.I thought the acting in this movie was incredible. All of the actors did a great job in connecting with one another for each scene they were in. It wasn't so far over the top that it got annoying. One small thing was the way all the guys had that gruff, smoking-for-their-lives way of talking, but since that's common in film noir, it worked. Also, the voice-overs could be annoying for some. They didn't bother me, since I realized those, too, are common in film noir, and there were three different stories in this film.The fight scenes were cool. I really liked watching Marv fight. While they're a little over-the-top, I was okay with it.All in all, I just loved this film. I thought it was supremely awesome, and I'm planning on buying it once it's out.",9,0,2,19 April 2005
