10 Cloverfield Lane," Half a movie
","I gonna keep this short since this is the first movie I have ever commented on. I went in to this movie without any knowledge of Cloverfield and I was bored. Honestly felt that the movies plot was too thin and easily figured out I mean there were kids in my theater that got it faster than the adults. The only saving grace was John Goodmans performance as Howard, the other cast members gave an OK performance. The conspiracy theory/abduction/survivalist/apocalypse lot just felt too forced together. I will try and watch the original but I have never been a fan of the found footage genre. Definitely would wait for the Blu-ray release, hopefully Batman V Superman is better.",4,3,8,27 March 2016
