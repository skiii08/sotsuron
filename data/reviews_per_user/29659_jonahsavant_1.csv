Changeling," Clint falls badly, Angie continues her streak of invulnerable performances
","I find it hard to believe this is the same director who directed the masterful 'Million Dollar Baby.' Perhaps Clint has gotten old and lost in touch in the last year or so? That is all I can think of, as this movie is so tremendously off. Scene after scene, it just doesn't work at all. It's as if an utter hack was directing it. Angelina Jolie's performance is truly terrible. Watching her also, I thought, how can this be the same talented actor from 'Girl, Interrupted'? But the truth is, Jolie is no longer an actress. She no longer takes risks. She just sits there, trying to look like Joan Of Arc(she does this in real life too now.) I don't like comparing someone's on screen persona with their offscreen persona, but Angelina Jolie invites it. I don't think we will see her anytime soon as a character that is vulnerable. And that's the problem. She is so busy playing strong(Marianne Pearl, Tombraider) that we don't feel anything for her. When she is sent into the mental ward, we know she will get out and endure. It's never a question. Contrast that with Jessica Lange in 'Frances' and you see what Changeling could have been with a better actress and a director on his game. The acting time and time again doesn't work. The screenplay doesn't help anyone. Amy Ryan's character tell us a bunch of things about oppression against women that feels woefully extra... WE GET IT! Doesn't need to spelled out by a prostitute in a mental ward. Holy cow!The few decent moments come from Michael Kelly and Clint's opening jazz guitar.",3,8,28,18 November 2008
