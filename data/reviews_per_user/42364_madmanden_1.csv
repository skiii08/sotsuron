Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious movie with lots of laughs
","I've just seen Borat at an advance screening, and I must say that I've never laughed this much at a movie. It's simply a riot, full of laughs practically all the time. Of course one has to be aware that the humor is very foul, but if you like that sort of this, then Borat is definitely for you! Now, I'm not American so I can't say for sure how you will like the humor. But with an open mind this is one of the funniest movies ever. Not to be missed.Try to avoid too many spoilers about the movie, the less you know of the jokes beforehand, the better.I give it 9/10 for the comedy value.",10,6,20,30 October 2006
