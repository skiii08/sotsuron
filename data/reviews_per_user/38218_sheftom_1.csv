The New World," And then they laughed ...
","Just saw 'The New World.' When it was over, the crowd in the packed theater that I was in - laughed. Yes, laughed. This movie was a gross disappointment. The music was atrocious - be sure to bring some good ear plugs to the movie. Don't bring anything that would assist you in hurting yourself.I got the impression that they must have trimmed this from over four hours of film. (The movie runs for a grueling 2 hours 30 minutes. The story was so dis-jointed. The movie does not communicate very well at all. The movie moves so slowly it is unbearable. Some people got up and left the theater, the rest of us hung in hoping that it would get better. There were a couple of good scenes, disjointed as they were. The director must have been asleep when they put the scenes together. I don't believe I paid $8 to see this. I love historical movies, and I think the approach that was intended in this movie is good - 'clash of cultures,' if you will.As we left the theater, it was clear that everyone felt that the movie was a ripoff. I'll not rent the DVD.",3,2,10,22 January 2006
