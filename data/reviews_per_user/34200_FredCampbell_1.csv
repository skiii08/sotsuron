Walk the Line," You can't make a movie about Johnny Cash
","Entertaining as a film? Yes. A worthy depiction of the early career of Johnny Cash? No. It is every bit as formulaic as the many other music bio-pics that have come around in the last 30 years or so, but I don't think it could have been anything else, considering the subject matter. I don't think you can make a movie about Johnny Cash.There are lots of clich√©s in this film, like the obligatory line that leads audiences to mutter 'Oh, that's where he/she got the idea for that song.' While I don't think you can make a movie about Johnny Cash, the subject of his life deserves better treatment than this tedious rehash.",3,9,22,19 November 2005
