Hereditary," A gripping, unconventional and an unsettling movie, Hereditary is one of the best horror movies I've seen so far this decade.
","I don't know why I decided to watch this gem at 3 in the morning. This is one of the best horror movies so far this decade, it doesn't rely on jumpscares or loud noises like most horror films its more of an unconventional masterpiece. I loved the tension created in this movie and the editing choices were phenomenal and actually unsettled me alot. The acting in this movie is superb especially by the females in particular Toni Collette who actually in my opinion gives the best female performance of the year. The film does not feel claustrophobic but it does feel contained in these particular locations which adds to the horror of this movie. This is Ari Aster's first feature lenght movie as a director and now he's on my radar I can't wait to see what he does next because he has crafted this movie to almost perfection. The ending has to be the best but also the most unnerving endings I've seen. The only flaw I can think of is the exposition which I get it that in such movies characters have to speak out the exposition but I felt this movie would've been better with less vocal exposition like The Shining. In the end, Hereditary is a very gripping, unnerving and unconventional horror film the best infact since The Babadook, it combines the elements of art house and horror very well and its a must watch for all horror fans but viewer discretion is advised because of it's disturbing nature. I give it an 'A+' and '9.5/10'.",8,173,326,30 August 2018
Bird Box," A rehash but with strong performances and a promising plot
","I was very hyped before watching this movie and I can't say it was worth it. Its not perfect by any means though, there are some wrong decisions made in the film making. Firstly, the movie dragged on a bit I was expecting a 1 hr 30 min or 1hr 45 min movie but instead I got a 2 hr 4 min movie which felt a bit too long. Secondly, some of the character arcs weren't fulfilled as I believe they should've been. Thirdly, I can understand why some people may compare this to A Quite Place so the timing of the release could've been better. However, the pros outweigh the cons firstly, the suspense built is perfect this is partly due to the actors but a major part is of the director. Secondly, the cinematography was spectacular including the color pallet. Thirdly, the performances were phenomenal especially the one given by Sandra Bullock the whole movie is built on her incredible performance, even the child actors were good. Lastly, it didn't feel like a throw away movie it was actually worth the time invested as it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats which I think is why I give it a 6.5/10 and 'C' grade.",6,1,5,13 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity War is the Marvel version of Game of Thrones and it pays off
","Avengers Infinity War is one of those rare gems where a movie exceeds your expectations. The action sequences and tge production design is phenomenal no surprise in that as its an MCU movie. Thanos is a fantastic villain, I despised his actions in the movie but there was something about the way his character was written that makes the audience know why his motives and they've shown him not necessarily a conflicted character but a character that has a certain level of humanity props to Josh Brolin for making Thanos believable and not some generic bad guy. This film really shocked me with some of the decisions and some of the character arks and I'm glad that it didn't go the safe route. Honestly I believe that this may very well be one of the best MCU movies and one of the best to come out this year. My only problem with the film is that the film didn't flow fluently which I get because there were so many subplots but that's the only issue I have. Lastly, the Russo brothers deserve the respect of every movie fan for putting together such an epic and grand movie and making it good.",7,1,4,30 August 2018
