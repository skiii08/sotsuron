Hereditary," Easily one of the best horror films in recent memory.
","In the age of cheap, surface-level horror, the rare gems that shine through need to be praised. This film absolutely disturbed me, in the best possible way. It felt like a modern version of The Exorcist, but with a far more complex and intriguing plot. It tears your expectations to shreds, and even for a seasoned horror film enthusiast is very hard to predict. First movie in a while that truly stayed in my head after viewing. Definitely among my favorite horror films, and more than certainly worth a watch.",Null,0,4,21 June 2018
