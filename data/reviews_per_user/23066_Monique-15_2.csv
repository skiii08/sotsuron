Requiem for a Dream," Addictions Anyone???
","Requiem for a Dream is not for everyone . . . if you're content with the status quo and have no interest in independent film (or thought)... do not bother to see this film.  You'll have recurring dreams of kitchen appliances and it will ruin your carefully constructed belief system.  It is a powerful, thought-provoking film that's disturbed everyone that I know who has seen it.Requiem for a Dream is about addictions - the addictions that we, as a society, excuse (diets) and condemn (drugs) and the way we deal with them (denial).  Aronofsky takes the rule book for the typical anti-drug flick and tosses it out of the window.  His film shouts its anti-addiction message louder than any after school special ever could, and although it is definitely worth watching every bit (especially the gripping ending) - it's a bitter pill.  So bitter that the MPAA has given it an NC-17 rating.  Yet another example of the MPAA shunning the innovative and powerful, whilst embracing the status quo.  Did I mention that this film really isn't for everyone?",10,0,0,20 November 2000
American Beauty," LOOK CLOSER . . . or else you will miss one of the best films of the year
","American Beauty . . . . . I have been trying to think of something appropriate to say to properly explain the smile that I've had on my face since I saw this film, but words fail me.  If only I could project a video of a plastic bag blowing wild and free in the wind.  Maybe that would be more appropriate.  Let me get my adulations out of the way, Kevin Spacey does an excellent job of showing the true transformation that Lester goes through.  He shows all the ugly and beautiful sides of his character, and still allows him to remain human enough for us to care about what happens to him - often in spite of ourselves.  Another stellar performance comes from Wes Bentley, as Ricky Fitts, the new boy next door whose performance is rock solid and whose stare is as impermeable as stone.  Bentley gives us a glimpse into a young man whose intense curiosity, offbeat resourcefulness, and deep insights are intoxicating.  On the whole, the entire cast does a wonderful job of bringing this story to life.My favorite scene (if you haven't already guessed) is when Ricky and Jane (played admirably by Thora Birch) are watching the video of the plastic bag being blown around in the wind.  I don't think I'll ever look at another piece of paper, bag or leaves being blown by the wind again.  The imagery and the poetry evident throughout the film is staggeringly beautiful - all the true romantics at heart should appreciate this.  It's part of what I loved best about the film - the poetry and beauty in all things.As you can see, I am a great fan of this film.  So, I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid of taking a look at the darker, yet often funny side of life, those who are willing to see the uglier sides of themselves, those who are willing to look closer and find the beauty of truth.",10,0,0,27 September 1999
