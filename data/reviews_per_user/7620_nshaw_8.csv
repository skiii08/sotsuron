Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing.
","After seeing some of the silly changes made to the Star Wars trilogy in the Special Edition, I knew that this movie was going to be seriously inferior to the original trilogy and that Lucas had lost his vision and was merely looking to tinker with the new special effects technology at his disposal.However, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised with the film. It wasn't quite as bad as I thought it might be. It had something that passed for a plot and a few interesting characters.The problems with the film really stuck out. First, the acting was marginal and the dialogue terrible and silly. Next, the special effects were too squeaky-clean and pastel-like to be believable. Nothing had that 'lived-in' look from the original trilogy. Finally, the story doesn't mesh with the original trilogy and there are too many gaping plot holes and connections made between characters in these films and the characters in the old ones to be believable.This was a roughly hour and a half long advertisement for Star Wars action figures. If you go into this movie wanting to see anything but that you are going to be sorely disappointed.",5,0,1,7 January 2006
The Ring," This movie was ridiculous.
","This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, right next to the Blair Witch. Basically, this is the premise: A bunch of teenagers watch what looks to be a Marylin Manson or Nine Inch Nails music video on a VHS tape they find in a motel in the woods. Then they get phone calls from a ghost who politely tells them they will die in 7 days (gives them time to buy life insurance policies, I suppose). Then in seven days an 11 year girl crawls out of their TV sets and beats the snot out of them. I'm serious, it really is that stupid.Eventually, the protagonist of the story decides to copy the tape thus allaying her own demise at the hands of the vengeful cathode ray tube spector. That is right, everybody who has seen it has to copy the tape to avoid having a little girl climb out of their TV and beat the crap out of them. There were many elements blatantly stolen from other movies (such as the sixth sense). In all fairness, the production values and special effects were pretty good and there were a few choice gory scenes. But for the most part this was an immensely stupid movie that scared no one.Wait for this one to come out on cable TV or borrow it from someone who has the DVD. DO NOT PAY TO SEE IT. IT IS NOT WORTH PAYING FOR.",3,1,2,3 February 2005
Finding Nemo," Review of 'Finding Nemo'
","You know in the real events that the real life story that 'Finding Nemo' was based upon, Nemo was put in the garbage disposal in the sink at the dentists office (after some of the other fish in the aquarium contracted fin rot from him and died) and his father was eaten by the pelican.Disney always has to give perfectly acceptable stories with a moral to them these ridiculous happy endings which are not healthy for children to watch because they give them false expectations of life.Let kids get to know the truth for once, Disney!!! Another complaint is that I did not see a Pink Snapper in this hole movie. What a disappointment. Its my favorite dish.",1,9,37,18 April 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Pretend Oceans 12 never existed
","This movie was disappointing. It started off well enough but about a third of the way into the film, it was as if the script had been written by someone different. Like a brain dead actor. The plot quickly became silly and convoluted. The plausiblity of the events that were taking place just got weaker and more ridiculous as the film continued. Did the actors change the script or something? This really was a disaster. Don't rent or this. Its crap.This doesn't compare with Oceans 11. The characters aren't even all that true to form in this film, but rather cartoonish caricatures of who they were in the first. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.",4,0,0,18 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Still disappointing.
","After seeing some of the silly changes made to the Star Wars trilogy in the Special Edition, I knew that that the Phantom Menace was going to be seriously inferior to the original trilogy and that Lucas had lost his vision and was merely looking to tinker with the new special effects technology at his disposal. The exact same things can be said for the second of his prequels, the Attack of the Clones.I was somewhat pleasantly surprised with the film. It was a significant improvement from the Phantom Menace and much of the unbearable silliness was absent from this one. It had something that passed for a plot and a few interesting characters.However, this film did suffer from the same problems as Phantom Menace, though to a lesser degree in some areas. First, the acting was marginal and the dialogue terrible although not as silly as in Phantom. Next, the special effects were too squeaky-clean and pastel-like to be believable. Nothing had that 'lived-in' look from the original trilogy. Finally, the story doesn't mesh with the original trilogy and there are too many gaping plot holes and connections made between characters in these films and the characters in the old ones to be believable.This was a roughly hour and a half long advertisement for Star Wars action figures. If you go into this movie wanting to see anything but that you are going to be sorely disappointed.",6,0,1,7 January 2006
Paranormal Activity," Best horror film I've seen in years.
","The film does a good job of using the reactions of the characters and subtle cues to imply activities are taking place without relying on CGI or other features modern viewers are accustomed to. However, the subtle nature of the film will turn off viewers who were expecting a mindless tour de force of gore and shock. The demon in the film is made more believable due to the fact that its existence is implied through what first appears to be common phenomena.The only flaw in the film is that a contrived and out-of-place ending was forced upon the director by influences in Hollywood who were threatening to can the film permanently. I am not mentioning what the ending is, so this is not a spoiler. So, if you notice the end was a little silly, you are not alone. Hopefully, the DVD will contain the movie as it was intended by its director.",9,1,5,7 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not as terrible as the other prequals.
","About the only thing memorable from the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones was the special effects. Though they were probably decent enough movies, they were so far inferior to the original trilogy in terms of plot and originality that they were extremely disappointing.Now this last prequel, while it has the same gaping plot holes and silliness we have come to expect from the newer films, actually has a decent plot to it and some fairly captivating action sequences.It still falls short of the original trilogy in terms of story telling and originality, but it is actually an entertaining movie. Worth seeing at the theatre or renting. Not worth buying the DVD in my opinion.",7,0,0,7 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatest Light-hearted Sci-Fi Flick Of Them All.
","This movie was the the greatest light-hearted sci-fi flick of them all. It had an original plot, good acting, great casting, and it was just extremely fun to watch.The special effects of this film (in its original form) still stand up to this day despite the antiquated technology used to create them.The best thing about it was that the scenery and characters all seemed 'lived-in' and 'believable' as though although they didn't exist here on our world, they did exist somewhere. This is in stark contrast to the newer Star Wars prequals where the scenery and aliens are so colorful, squeaky clean and pastel-like that they actually look completely fake and you know that what you are looking at was cooked up on a computer.And last but not least, the most memorable screen villain of all time, Darth Vader, who spawned at least a hundred knock-offs. To this day villains in films often borrow from ol' Darth.",10,1,2,7 January 2006
