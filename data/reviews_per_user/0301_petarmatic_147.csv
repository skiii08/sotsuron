The King's Speech," Very good film!
","If you like British royals, and most people do, this is a film for you.It is amazing that in some countries of Europe monarchy survived, but they are all parliamentary monarchies where sovereign has not much to say in running the country. It will probably not change since they are so popular, and usually they do not give their rights easily. I wonder what will happen with Scotland in the upcoming referendum for independence?British monarchy is the most popular of them all. Hence there are so many films connected to it. One of those films is King*s speech about speech problems of King George VI.The film is very good, especially because of excellent performances of the leading actors. I recommend that you watch it.",7,0,1,25 November 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," It is not better then the first one!
","First of all about the furniture and the lamps. I loved them, although they belong more to the 19th century rather then to the 21st. But they fit so nicely with the film.Plot, well it is similar to the first one, but we have the new characters like the guy with the cubes. He is not that impressive like the lady medium who was killed in the beginning of the film.I think this film you should see if you saw the first part, but if you do not see it you can sleep quietly and not think about it that much, it really is not that impressive as the first one.Is the husband crazy?Or he is just pretending?You tell me. ;)",5,0,0,1 February 2014
Changeling," Fantastic!
","Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich in the same film! Yeah baby! Mummy Bosnia and Daddy Croatia! Please take care of us, we are lost little children, we are abducted, maltreated, lost in space! How much we would love for you to come and fight for us like you did Angelina does for this kid, over and over! With your in the Land of Blood and Honey, you Angelina tried, you really did, but that bad minister, bad, bad did not let you film in Bosnia! Shame on him! You mother of all of us, we will come and stay with you in your New York apartment all of us, 1 billion lost kids. Please find space to fit us in.WE ARE COMING!!!",8,1,2,23 February 2014
The New World," I was not that impressed!
","I guess this film did not impress me very much because I saw so many film connected wit Pochohontas and events surrounding her.Yes scenery is great and acting is not bad, but how many of this did we see? Cartoon and everything.When I actually went to the Jamestown and saw all that is connected with her, tour guide explained us in not very happy voice, that events portrayed in the cartoon and in this film is not entirely accurate.So if you are into historic films of discovery of America, this is a film for you.Otherwise, you can live without loosing sleep even if you do not see it.",5,1,1,7 January 2014
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Really outstanding an funny!
","Sasha Baron Cohen really made a breakthrough with this film. Everything about it is fantastic, acting, plot, humor, portrayal of cultural differences.When I saw this film in a small movie theater in Dubrovnik, place was packed to the limit. Which is a rare occurrence for that movie theater. Everyone was laughing and enjoying the pranks.Since I had similar experiences in the glorious USA (yeah right), I sympathized both with millions of immigrants and Americans who are receiving new competition each year.Christopher Columbus God damn you for taking that trip across the ocean and discovering that land of freedom and opportunity, you might us spared the ordeal.",8,1,1,26 February 2014
The Monuments Men," Interesting!
","I found this film interesting, but I do not think it is for a wider audience. It is for the art lovers and collectors.Acting is not that great, I found it a little bit too slow. George Clooney looks a little bit tired from everything, I do not blame him, he got to be a movie star but now he has to continue shooting and making new films. With his humanitarian work it just does not go together well.I want to address how many films were made about WWII. People just crave Hitler and his evil to be shown on film. I wonder why his evil deeds are so demanded and worshiped. It still puzzles me. It always will. The guy was a lunatic who surrounded himself with lunatics. with notable exception of Speer, and used bad economic and political situation in Germany to obtain power. Is public lunacy so attractive? It is like porn, everyone watches it, but no one admits liking it.",6,1,3,28 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Great film!
","What a film! Tom Hanks really acts with excellence! What a enjoyment to watch this! I do shaky head from shaky camera so this is the opportunity to ask the movie directors not to shake camera, we all get dizzy. Yes I know dynamics and all that, but some of us do not want to be on boats. We just want to sit in our lazy chairs and watch container ships bring goods to us.And you seamen out on the sea take my advice, carry a lot of weapons with you and shoot these pirates. If you shoot enough of them, there will be no more pirates to come and hunt these ships.",8,1,3,14 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I grew up...
","Well, after all those years of Episode IV,V and VI we finally came to get to see Episode I. I still remember it, i was in my Woodbrige movie theater, and I wanted to experience my personal premiere before I went to see it with my family.I have to say that many years have passed. Hollywood spoiled us over many years with the new special and visual effects. It is amazing how over many years technology in the film making increased in the positive. I have to take my hat off to all the people who made all that possible. VE of the 1970*s are funny compared to the VE of 1999 when this film came out.I was mesmerized, and with a sadness of the time gone by I left the movie theater...",7,0,1,30 March 2014
The Equalizer," Typical Denzel Wahington film!
","Denzel Washington films are starting to look like each other. I somehow could predict most of this film in advance. Plus it lasted a little bit too long. Since in the Cinema City they charge more for longer films I had to pay 1KM more for this one. That is not a kilometer or klick but rather konvertible mark, local currency.Well, since it lasted a little bit longer then usual I focused on many neat details in the film. Like the book he was reading, I read it when I was a teenager. Old man and the sea. Other cool details prevail like drilling a brain with a driller or the tattoos of the bad guys.All in all if you like D.W. (not Deutche Welle), and good action, this is a film for you. Otherwise, you can skip it with a peace of mind.",6,2,5,1 October 2014
The Young Victoria," The Young Victoria
","Billions of people from around the world loves the British royals and watches everything about them. They want to know what is happening with them and the history of that incredible lineage of royals which came during the history of that rainy island.The story of Victoria and her early love affair with Albert is in the center of this film. She later loved him so much that when he died she had his clothes taken every day out of the closet and laid for him on the couch. It also deals with fight of her custodians to try to gain reigns of power from her. It was avoided since the previous sovereign lived enough for Victoria to turn 18. Britan became super power during her reign and it is interesting to see how the early years of pre reign passed. Acting is excellent, costumes have to be excellent, it is a costume drama after all, and all is in red, color of the British royals. If you are into British royals, and you probably are, since half of the world is, it is a film for you. It is interesting to note that during Victoria time Britain was devoid of the fight for throne like in the earlier centuries, and the question of religion is not as acute as during the reign of Henry VIII or Elizabeth I.",6,1,1,13 October 2013
The Hangover," Light comedy to take your kids to.
","I do not take these kinds of films seriously. But a lot of people do. When I took my kids to see this the movie theater was full, everybody laughed, I had a few laughs too, I have to admit. If you want to make a lot of money you make a film like this. I looked at how much money this film made, outstanding amount of money! Plot is not serious, and it was not meant to be. It is a fluffy comedy that is for sure. I will not waste time on it. Typical fluffy comedy plot, Las Vegas and all.Acting is rather good, except Mike Thyson. I guess they had to put him in the film or he would beat them and end up in jail. We call that in Europe, buying social peace. Give him money and he will be peaceful. Other actors really tried.This is a film for you to take your family to and have fun. Please when you walk out of the cinema forget it!",3,1,3,15 March 2014
Iron Man 3," I had a feeling that I saw all that before.
","I really had a feeling that I saw something similar before. Yes, I know you will say all Iron Man films look alike, but it was not that. Generally I had a feeling that the plot is already done before in some way. It did not feel original or that interesting.I liked music and cinematography, and Visual Effects were not bad, but overall I would not give such a big grades to this film. It was one of the ordinary Sci Fi films, nothing out of the ordinary.Acting was very good, I especially like Ben Kingsley and his work in general, but I am sure most of the people like him, he is that kind of person that he can not be disliked.So, if you are the Iron Man fan this is a film for you, otherwise you do not have to loose any sleep if you do not get a chance to see it.",6,1,3,1 April 2014
John Wick," Very good action film!
","If you like action films with a lot of shooting this film is for you! I do not fancy personally too much action films but I was forced by my girl friend to go see this one. I was not sorry, just the opposite I enjoyed it.Character development was excellent, people look picturesque as they are in New Jersey and character of John Wick is excellent.I also liked camera work, they really are advanced, how much film making improved over the years.All in all if you like action films this one is for you, take time to relax and see many dead people, may be one of them is your boss, who knows? I do not want to forget to mention the umbrellas. The ones they were holding during burial scene in the beginning. They look expensive.",7,6,17,17 December 2014
Gravity," NEW AGE FOR Hollywood!!!
","I wanted to write a review about a film in which I would talk about how Hollywood went a long, make that a huge way since Lumiere brothers and late 19th century when that train entered that station. This is that film! The new age has been ushered, and we are going to see many more brilliant films in the future, that I am sure! What a business, and that is not just a remark, there is no business like show business! Bilions of people are thronging into movie theaters throughout the world eager to see a film with someone dear to them. And do not forget the popcorn and cola! It truly is a people*s art, just as that Russian philosopher said. This film I dedicate to Hollywood and its success! As far as plot goes, well never mind. Sandra pushes few buttons and saves herself. Clooney could of sipped few more sips of vodka while he was at it. We came back crushing back to Earth, all those billions of dollars NASA spent came down for Sandra to win the Oscar. She deserves that so much! The boy sitting next to me in the movie theater said:' Mommy I like when she pushes the buttons!' I was thinking to myself I could push few buttons on Sandra, hope she would not mind. So Sandra when you lift that Oscar think of your little fan since the time of Speed. You are such a nice person! Real darling! Actors usually are, and you are a star among them, shining! Just like the stars in space!The end was remarkable, we came back to Earth, since we can not conquer the space, and we are going to fight to walk the Earth freely. All six billion of us!",8,2,4,10 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Absolutely fantastic!
","If film deserves an Oscar this is the one. It kept me glood to the TV all the time. First about the film.Plot is fantastic. Modern war film at its best! Just as they made fantastic WWII films about fighting and all, so they made this film about modern war. Acting is extraordinary and scenes of the wild Afghanistan is beautiful. So, if you want to give an Oscar to a film this is it.Why NATO is in the Afghanistan? Well, they have a mandate to eradicate AlQayida. Did they? We still do not know. It seems that it is impossible. These guys are simply too big, will it work out? That is for the top commanders and generals to decide and determine.We are following the news, but are they telling us everything?",8,2,8,17 January 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," One of the best films of all times!
","Well, there is not much more I can say about this film, that has already been said. What can you add except the words fantastic, outrageously funny, beautiful, marvelous, outstanding. There can be more words added to that, but out of all the Monthy Python movies this one is definitely the best. I can*t say that the other once are less valuable. All of them are fantastic, and I enjoyed them so much.If there is a church for atheists this is the one to go to. I wish more films like this were made, but studios get cold feet when they try to fund films like these which work with mocking religion. At least Palin, Cleese and friends did not end up in jail, like that film director who tried to mock Islam. Enjoy! And watch it many times over, especially with your curious teen kids.",9,2,6,18 November 2013
Se7en," This was fantastic!
","Uh do I remember time when I saw this film for the first time! I think the most memorable part of it will be Morgan Freeman. That man just did a role of his life with that film! I was very impressed with the plot. For a police thriller this was very ingenious plot, with many twist and turns, jumpy and sad moments. I remember when I and my ex wife watched this film we were very depressed for that evening in style why do people have to be that way? Altogether, if you did not see that film , I would strongly recommend that you see it. Very rarely thriller can be so smart and interesting at the same time, and this is the case here.Also, it is probably Morgan Freeman*s role of life!",8,2,4,10 February 2015
Fury," Excellent WWII action film!
","I saw many WWII films but this one is very high on my list. It has action, and good plot, acting is excellent, not the forget visual and special effects. Especially I like editing, which I understand this film obtained some awards about it.My main question is, of course, is it historically accurate. I talked to some people who participated in WWII during tank battles in the western front, and they told me there are some accurate elements, on the other hand there are some which were not that accurate. For example, they do not believe that crew of one tank could of held for so long on its own, other is for example young German soldier leaving alive young American soldier who was hiding under the tank.Altogether, I think really had fun watching this film, and I would recommend that you watch it too. Two thumbs up!",8,4,9,14 January 2015
Fight Club," Fantastic!
","These types of films come on rare occasions and gives us, the audience who seek something different from Spiderman or Godzilla a unique experience! I am so glad this one came along, although I would love that these types come more often. Yes, there is Pulp fiction, and the similar but they are rare.Plot is so unusual and crisp and interesting that it kept me glood to the screen whole the time of the film. Scene are fantastic. Who thinks of these things? And the scenes, for example like that one sprinkling a priest with water, or that self fight scene in the office. Amazing!Acting is fantastic, these are some actors. What do you expect from Brad Pitt or H.B. Carter, but the best.This one is a must see! Don*t you miss it!",8,0,0,15 May 2014
The Maze Runner," Pleasantly surprised!
","I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this film.Although we saw similar plots before, I have to say that there was something new in this one. It was not all repetitive from the previous films of the same kind, it had something new in it. Those big spiders we saw before in some other films, I can not recall which ones but some similar animals were shown all the time in other sci fi films. The maze was spectacular and scenes inside were great. I really enjoyed it.Acting was good for the teen actors, I especially got fond of the character of the chubby little boy.All in all I have to recommend this film, especially to the crowds who enjoy sci fi films. Go for it!",8,0,1,1 October 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," I had to go and see this film!
","Well I was seven years old when Episode IV came out. I was sitting next to a seven year old forty plus years later and I felt like I was seven again. I mean that Darth Vader, is he as mean again as he will ever be? I am glad that he was voted as the worse villain of all times, he certainly deserves the Title.Fighting on the tropical island is particularly a nice touch to an excellent film. I can imagine how much work went into making this one, but I am sure every dollar was worth it.There is not much more that I can say about this film that it already has not been said. So do not miss it! Go and take your seven years old now that you are forty plus. ;)",8,3,7,12 January 2017
World War Z," Great film!
","I really liked this film, I went to see it two times, for me it is rare to do. Acting is great, plot is great, everything is worked on to the smallest details. Bradd Pitt carries this film, although it was so nice from him to hire unknown actors to work with him. Please go watch this film, you will have fun!The only weak point in the film is the end, it somehow ends too abruptly. I like Bradd Pitt and Angelina Jolie so much, they are such a nice people, their work around the globe is precious. When they were coming to Sarajevo I tried to meet them but I was not successful, well never mind I wish both of them make many good films which all of us will enjoy. Go for it Brangelina!",8,0,2,14 November 2013
The Hunger Games," Better then the second one
","I liked this first part better then the second part.The problem is that I saw so many of these types of films in my time.But I would not go as far as to give it 10 out of 10 as some reviewers did.It does not deserve that much.Main female actress (I am not sure of her name) is excellent.She is good looking and acts really good.She would be an excellent actress in the other type of film, if you get my drift.There is not much else to say about this film except that it is too long.",7,0,4,22 November 2013
Argo," Outsdanig!
","What do you write about film like this that has not been written before? It really is an outstanding piece of film making.We all knew about the real story of the US Embassy in Iran and its problems, and how they evacuated the staff. When I was a teenager we talked about this. How the whole thing turned around when Islamic Revolution in Iran started. But we had no idea that evacuation was so dramatic.About the film: Plot is by itself very interesting. Since it is based a true story it makes it even more interesting how Canada and the USA worked together to rip away their Embassy staff from the clutches of the Islamic fundamentalists.Acting is also excellent, there is a reason why this film won three Oscars.Well done! It is a must see! Those planes, they do miracles!",8,0,1,16 March 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek movie which did not fail us, again!
","I really like J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies. They are incredibly good, full of excellent VE, actors are always good, action is almost non stop. What else can you ask from a Star Trek movie? And especially if they go to the Klingon home world. Why? Well, 1992 when we had census in the former Yugoslavia I found Klingons so sexy when they asked me for my nationality (a very important question in that census) I answered that I am a Klingon and my native language is Klingonese. From the moment I watched the original Star Trek series to the newest films I always enjoyed all of that world which Rodenbery invented. What an imagination and brain! The saying: Beam me up Scotty! is a legendary one. We use it whenever something out of ordinary happens, something we cannot comprehend, and we have to admit there are a lot of those moments this rotating Earth gives to us. Didn*t you want to be beamed up if you were a New Yorker during 9/11? Or in any of those incredibly crazy moments we can not comprehend.Which part of the film I like the most? When two of them were flying from ship to ship. It was fun. The rest of the film was great too. Full two hours of pure entertainment! Loved it and recommend it. I am sure J.J. Abrams is preparing for a new film, which will be good as this one if not better. Go for it!",7,1,2,12 October 2013
12 Angry Men," Oh man! The court cases!
","From this film everything we watched later involving court cases derives. What I meant by this, after so many people watched they demanded films to be created showing court and court cases over and over again. Even because of that, later real court cases were televised like OJ Simpson case. Even Roman Polanski was offered to return to the USA for his always incomplete pedophilia case, but he refused. Only rarely people distinguish between film set and real life, and he Mr. Polanski is one of them at least I presume.If you did not watch this film yet it is a must see for you, there is no escape! You might be selected for a jury one day! YOU! And you might want to wish to get some blood.",8,0,1,7 February 2015
The Other Boleyn Girl," How many more of Henry VIII?
","How many more films on this theme I have to watch? I mean I saw a whole bunch of mini series, series and films about Henry VIII and his six wives.This one has some excellent costumes, sets and acting is outstanding. When these stars act, you really just have to sit and watch in amazement. It can not get much better then this as far as the acting is concerned.If you go to the Hampton Court you can see good old King Henry being reenacted by an actor and the rest of his court as well. It is interesting, but that is it. I would not dwell too much more on that part of English history, because it was very tragic for some, but at the same time very interesting and it changed that rainy island for ever...",7,0,0,12 May 2014
Elizabeth," Excellent!
","This is an extraordinary portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in her early years of reign. I really like films dealing about British monarchy because it is great source of films, series and theater. Many historians thought that British monarch was going to survive, but in the end it did. Hence, we have all these films and series dealing on the subject.First about the film, naturally plot had to be this way, we know a lot about QEI and her life. Acting is fantastic, no wonder Kate Blanchett received Oscar for her role. Costimography is excellent and choice of the sets also. All in all it is a must see, especially for those buffs of the royals.A little bit about the history. I was always wondering how did she manage to stay afloat, everything was against her. She succeeded in defeating Spain and the poor Phillip II did not manage to bring back Roman Cathoicism to Britain. It was a really an outstanding miracle of her times. Many historian can not explain all of that yet, but explanation is rather simple. They did not have weather man during those times.",8,0,0,15 March 2014
The Great Dictator," What a film!
","There are rare films which bring such a fantastic feel after you watched it. This film is up there with the other classics of Charlie Chaplin. I watched his work for so long and I saw it all, he just deserves all superlatives for his work.When I wanted to escape wars and problems, and there were couple of times of those situations, I felt like those two guys trying to hide in a box, just like in this film. And if you watch it you will see that scene.What else to say about work of Carlie Chaplin except that you have to watch it, and watch all of it! What a man, what a work!",9,1,2,25 November 2013
Ed Wood," Great film about a failed movie maker
","Ed Wood was a failure as a movie director and producer, but film ABOUT Ed Wood is not. I would highly recommend this film not only to learn how someone fails in his profession but also because film is excellent to watch.Poor Ed Wood. He so much wanted to succeed in the real film industry but ended up in the film industry which everyone watch:porn. That is it. We all want to watch the regular films, but ALL men and a lot of women watch porn. I wonder how Ed Wood be as a porn director? He probably would be very successful. So this is a message for you who wants to work in film, you either show talent or go shoot porn!",8,1,1,12 November 2013
About Time," What to say?
","This is one of those films I do not know how to grade, what to say about it. Since I have my ten lines to fill I will have to say something.First of all most UK films I saw in my life were extraordinary. This one is not. I think it is an average try to make it humorous and entertaining. I think they failed. After first hour I wanted to switch it off. Time travel makes it interesting but not amusing. Where is that British sense of humor gone? Boring! Acting is good on the side of excellent. Actors are really trying to do their best. scenes of English folk are also interesting but not astonishing. Hell Emily Hartridge with her 10 reasons why on facebook is more fun for 10 minutes then this film is anywhere close for long two hours.Use your time better, walk in the countryside during that rain. Which is present all the time. In England.",3,1,10,19 January 2014
Don Jon," Fantastic!
","Before I start reviewing this film I have to mention that in the film they mentioned pornhub.com as a master porn web page. I choose xhamster.com over it. You porn lovers will love it. It is a king of porn web pages.As far as the film goes this is it! This film goes right into the middle of the issue. THE ISSUE! Men watch porn! That is right in the middle of the men minds. They are fatally attracted to it! And a lot of women for that matter! I really think there is nothing to it. It just happens, and does not affect society for that matter. A lots of people think it matters a lot, but actually it does not. When Holland legalized prostitution in 1960s everyone thought that Dutch society would fall apart. But it did not. Opposite happened! Holland started attracting a lot of tourists. Legal prostitution spread like a wild fire to many nations on Earth, and porn is helping that. In effect I think it has a positive impact on the World. People get together, have sex and are less violent, For example in Holland there is almost no domestic violence. There is significantly less of it then in the societies where prostitution is not legal.To make a long story short, this film is fantastic and answers many questions about porn, sex, and love. It answers questions on societies in general too. It is a MUST see! Please take time to watch it.",8,4,6,30 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Oh Darth you have left me for ever!
","I was 14 or 15 years of age, I guess. Our little Star Wars club in Sarajevo was shivering with expectation. What was the final episode going to bring? I guess we were all a little bit disappointed. After the Empire Strikes Back and the glorious wins by Darth Vader and the Empire, it was all over, we found out that who really is Darth Vader and that the Empire was going to collapse and that the Jedi were returning and making a final win. Why did the Emparor had to die? Could not he also be converted to the Light Side so they could all live happily ever after? No, I guess not. The evil Emperor and Darth Vader had to die! You Saddams and Slobos, may that be a warning to you for ever! Later that evening after screening was over, us, the part of the club who loved the Dark Side, the minority, we had to go home, while the Light Siders had a party. Was there sex involved? Hm.That how it was a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...",8,0,1,25 March 2014
Begin Again," Very enjoyable film!
","As I am writing this Lenoard Nemoy died. Just as Star Trek took us to imaginary space continuum, this film takes us to space continuum of New York music scene. I would say non existent scene, because I never cool people like that when I lived in NYC. Although, I did live there for a short period of time, may be times have changed.I truly enjoyed this film. I enjoyed cool, casual plot. I enjoyed the music. I enjoyed cool, casual acting. I really succeeded in relaxing while watching this film. That is a rare occurrence for me, since they make tense and visual effects filled films these days. These relaxing, art oriented film are more rare these days. Too bad! I strongly recommend that you watch this film, especially if you like relaxing, good music filled films.",8,2,4,27 February 2015
The Book Thief," An outstanding achievement!
","It is rare in this day and age that films like these are produced. I am so glad that I had an opportunity to witness such an achievement.Acting is outstanding. What do you say about these actors, especially the young girl. Unbelievable, how do they do it with such a young kids. All together acting is outstanding, I hate to single someone out but girl is something special.Plot is very unusual for a WWII film. Usually it is either fighting or life in the USA or UK while men are at the front. We rarely take a human-civilian look at the events taking inside Germany during the war. I do not say that films have not been made before about the subject, but it has not been done in a while. I was especially impressed by the recreation of a small town inside Germany during those times, Kristalnacht and book burning ritual. Everything was done by precision and it looks outstanding on the screen. Job well done! We saw so many films on the subject in the past, but we should never stop reminding young generations about horrors of the war. While I was watching this inside my local movie theater, there were many young teenagers watching this, they probably saw film about Nazi era for the first time.All in all it is a must see, please make an effort to see this film!",8,4,8,5 February 2014
Capote," Outsdanding!
","I write this review, as I found out that actor Philip Seymour died. R.I.P.This was one of the excellent films which came out in 2005.Amazingly plot deals with death and death sentence. When you deal with a subject of death it has a way of creeping into your life, which it was well portrayed in the film Capote. Capote, although trying to stay neutral in his tryout of writing a book about prisoners and death sentence, he is drawn into it. You simply can not stay out of that horrible circle in which you are drawn when working on such a subject.No wonder Philip won an Oscar for the portrayal of Capote, he does it so well. The moment when he tells us that scarf he is wearing is of a certain brand will always stay in my mind.It is a must see, especially with a demise of Philip, for he has left a masterpiece behind.",8,2,2,3 February 2014
Life of Pi," Does it deserve?
","I was not that impressed by this film as other people did.Does it deserve all those rewards and nominations? I do not think so.Yes, the visual effects are fabulous, but story is not that much.Why it was treated with so many awards puzzles me.I guess I am not a person who likes these types of films.It is more for children then for adults.That is all I had to say about this film.OK.Enough.That is it.",5,5,11,5 January 2014
Interstellar," I was not that impressed!
","When I saw high grades and glorious reviews for this film I thought I was going to see something really special. Well for some parts I did, but for the others I did not. For example, Prometheus was far better film as far as the sci fi genre goes.The plot for this film was somehow same to what I saw before in other types of these films. I could make a puzzle from different plots and make this one. It was all said and done before.Acting did not impress me either, somehow casting could of been better. I do not know, do you agree with this? Visual effects were excellent, but today they all are since the companies which make these types of films really figured out their trade well.If you like sci fi films you should see this film, otherwise do not loose your sleep over it.",5,6,12,7 November 2014
American Sniper," Disappointing!
","I saw two films recently which have one thing in common, that is the state of Texas. One was the Boyhood and other was the American Sniper. I have to say if I was asked which film to choose for the Oscar I would definitely without a doubt choose the Boyhood.This film I simply did not like because of many things, first it talks about war which I deplore so much, other was that I do not like shooting films any more. I used to when I was young, but not any more.I totally understand American involvement in the Middle East, but it seems to me that they lost the war since ISIL showed up and I am not sure Americans and their allies have strength to defeat, what actually became general insurgency against the USA and its allies in the Middle East and good parts of Asia and Africa.As far as acting goes it is OK for this type of patriotic propaganda films.",4,2,16,6 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Weaker of them all...
","I have to say that this episode is, according to my humble opinion weaker of them all. I think Visual Effects and Special Effects are still on the high level, but story is a little bit weak.I guess, there had to be some connection between Episode I and Episode III, so the whole story would make some sense, hence this film was made to bridge those two films.I remember I was with my kids, they were so scared and fascinated with the whole series that it was going to be a beginning of a spending spree on buying all the memorabilia connected with the Star Wars. We paid our dues, so we hope that it contributed to the love for film making and film in general for our kids. I am sure it did....",6,0,3,30 March 2014
Forrest Gump," Stupid!
","but very smart! I think this made Tom Hanks one of the most popular actors of our times! Script is very interesting and his acting is, I do not know how to describe it, beyond fabulous! It is one of those films which stick with you from the first moment that you see it. After I watched it I went: It is the stupid that is so popular today in the movie theaters? But I did not take it too seriously.I glorify its fantastic acting, camera and sets this film was filmed in. Of course, I assume that 99 per cent of the population saw this film. If you are within those 1 per cent, you either do not like stupid people or you are stupid yourself ;) Just watch it!",9,3,4,7 February 2015
American Hustle," Is this film really up for the Oscars?
","I really did not like this film that much.Yes recreation of New Jersey from those years is really nice, and acting is not bad, but plot is really thin.New Jersey is a fascinating state. I spent couple of years there and I was fascinated by the people. They all look like from the Sopranos. This film portrays them well, but that is about it.I am not sure why this film is up for the Oscars.I saw many better films then this one, i wanted to walk out after 45 minutes of it being screened.Now I would need to write something else about this film but it does not deserve it.So I will say nothing more.",3,14,26,16 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," It is not a sequel it is a timeless new classic
","I agree with many reviewers that this film is not a sequel to the Godfather I but rather whole new film with whole new cast and new, fresh plot. Al Pacino and De Niro shine in this film and it is interesting to watch how the plot writers succeeded in making a whole new and fantastic film out of same theme as the first part.It is difficult to add more then it is already written about this film by the professional critics and other reviewers. I will just have to refer you to read as much about this film that it has already been written and to watch it over and over again.Just as in the first part I wonder how much of it could of happen in the real life. I guess some probably, but how much? It is for you to answer...",8,0,1,6 February 2015
Fargo," Ah that cold north.
","What did he need that money for? I am sure who ever watched this film wondered this question many times over. What in the Earth did he need that money for? Could he not just ask his father in law to borrow him some? Probably he used it on prostitutes, so he could not ask his father in law. If his father in law just gave him that money we would probably not have the film. I think it was crucial part of the plot.We are witnessing resurgence of this film into 10 hours series. I really think this film deserves to be developed further after all the success he achieved.Since I spent some time in West Michigan, I know the mentality of those northern states of the USA. I was actually amazed that they made something exciting about that area of the USA since it so boring there.Characters are so well developed and plot is very interesting. But plot writers, please, please reveal the secret in the series why in the world did he need that money for?",8,0,0,3 April 2014
Rush," I was not impressed at all!
","When I read reviews about this film I was really astonished that it got such a great reviews. I was not impressed with it at all.I did not find acting that great. Actors looked very TVish.Special effects were good but not great.Recreations of the races were good but not spectacular.All in all I could easily skipped this film and be happy about it. So I recommend to you, unless you are great formula one fan, you can sleep calmly without watching this film..I certainly do not think this film deserves so high on the IMDb scale of 250 films.",5,3,10,20 February 2014
Nightcrawler," Very interesting, original and fresh!
","I really enjoyed this film very much. Plot is so interesting and well written that it kept me glued to the TV screen which is in the middle of this film. The TV I mean. We all stare at it. Too much, I would say that from time to time bad guys make some crime just for us to watch the news. They do that from small crimes to big ones like 911 was.Everything is great about this film that I gave it a high grade, since it really deserves. It describes for us local TV news journalism, which is almost on the predatory level. It also shows well Los Angeles violent way of life of these days in history.Acting is excellent, to the level of creepy.I simply have no choice but to recommend this film for everyone who likes some action with brains. That is so rare to come by these days. This film delivers all what you need to be glued to the omnipotent and almighty TV SCREEN.",8,0,1,20 March 2015
Léon: The Professional," Some things I liked some I did not.
","I was very surprised to see that this film received such a high grade. I did not think it deserves it.Things i liked about it. It is the acting of two principal actors, Mr. Reno I like very much from the times of La Femme Nikita, he is a spectacular actor, especially in the roles like these. Natalie Portman is also excellent in a role like this, later in the Star Wars I did not like her that much. I think as a young teenager in this film she is excellent, for the later roles I am not that sure.Things I did not like. Plot is not realistic. I simply do not like that. When is something like this possible in the real life? Never. Also too much violence, but films of Luc Besson are always like that. I guess it has to be that way. Violence and sex sells. Especially if you throw a slight nudge of pedophilia in it.",7,2,3,11 April 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," First!
","When this film came out I really thought wow! What a film! And it really is! I enjoyed everything, from beginning to the end! There are really a lot of reviews for this film, there is not much to add.Film is excellent, visual effects too, plot is fantastic and film keeps you glood to the screen! I wanted to watch the second and third film, but I had to wait second and third year for it although all three were made at the same time.The whole map was interesting of different worlds they created.Fight between good and evil!Good wins!Must see!",7,0,0,13 December 2013
We're the Millers," Cute movie
","They are cute, the van and all. Jennifer Aniston is a star like always, what a body, eh? In the real life in the USA there are no people like this in the real life, they are mostly in jail, so it is nice to release them for a movie plot for a change, less they are the actors. Movie for fun and a laugh, my favorite part is when they cheated Aniston with a song in the bloopers. What a face she had! Sunday afternoon film to take the kids to...I would love to write more about this film but I do not have anything to add. IDMB should rethink their minimum 10 line policy, since I do not have anything to add how will I fill 10 lines?",6,0,1,10 October 2013
Apocalypse Now," Watching it again, it does not loose its outstanding quality.
","When I saw this film for the first time when I was a teenager I was amazed with its quality and a message it wanted to share with the world. Message was: No one can stay unbruised by war. PTSD comes in various ways and it really keeps human being who is sick of it as a living corps. This was well portrayed in the character of the colonel played so well by Marlon Brando.Everything about this film is outstanding, from cinematography to action and plot together with interesting voodoo tribes and portrayal of the Vietnames jungle.A lot of things had been said about this film, and I just can add my humble prise to it.It is a must see, just as all the classics are a must see. This is one of those classics.",8,1,2,30 April 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," I liked it!
","I liked this film, but I do not think it deserves all the awards it was given.Acting is excellent, what a cast! Dialogue is fast and dynamic! I really enjoyed it.This film shows well psychiatric illness. It is all too common in your and my neighborhood. Do pills help? In some cases they do.And why is he running around the neighborhood with a plastic bag on the top of his body? I guess he is crazy! And she was a slut and she is not anymore? Give me a break! If you have someone crazy in your family this is a film for you!",6,1,2,7 January 2014
Ender's Game," Not impressed!
","What is Harrison Ford doing in a film like this? I guess he had to make kids happy.It obviously is a kid sci fi movie, made by the adults for kids.These sci fi films are looking more and more like the computer games over and over again. Today kids are growing up with computer games, and films made for them have to reflect computer games.I have to admit that visual and special effects are well done.Harrison Ford acting is excellent like always is. He just does not fit in a film like this. Somehow.How many more films can you make about Earth being attacked by the aliens of different kinds?I guess many.",5,0,2,15 December 2013
The Intouchables," Very high influx of the Africans in France!
","I will not share enthusiasm for this film. I saw other reviews. I know it is politically correct to help people. And I did not think of the disabled people. I was thinking about millions of Africans and other immigrants trying to come into France, specially Paris and trying to find a job. How many will succeed, one per cent? This film focuses on a aristocrat who hires a poor African from the suburbs of Paris. How often that happens in the real life? Not that often.Plot is, well OK, but not that realistic, and that is what I hate. I like realistic plots not improbable ones like this one.Acting is excellent, actors are really trying to make something out of this film. Many people liked it. I did not that much.",5,7,23,16 March 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," I was a bit disappointed, reviews were too good.
","I am not really sure why this film received so many good reviews, I was a bit disappointed.It is not that this film does not have its moments, it certainly does, but there is not really that much new in the plot. It is the same old, same old. Saw it so many time before in X man or other sci fi films.Acting is great by some actors, I always love Patrick Stewart showing up, he is one of my favorite actors, other actors are good too but they are not the best. For this kind of films we receive usually this kind of acting, sometimes we expect better.All in all I am not sure that it deserves to be among top 250 film on IMDb page, it is just another sci fi film.P.S. Nixon was not well portrayed by his actor.",7,3,10,25 May 2014
American History X," Very nice try!
","This is a film which did a really nice tryout in making peace between different cultures in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles.Will it work? I am not sure. Probably not. The USA is too big and diversified for all of the different cultures to live in peace and harmony. All those shooting sprees and all those problems. There will be always some tensions between different nations and cultures living there. But there are tensions in other multinational countries as well. Nothing new.Acting is excellent, plot is very interesting and describes these problems so well. I am so glad Captain Sisko came along to lend a hand. Very nice.All in all it is a must see film to all students of the American culture.",8,1,2,23 April 2014
Spirited Away," Great cartoon!
","I usually do not review cartoons since they are usually for children, but I wanted to see this one since it won an Oscar and was very highly rated on the IMDb 250 films. First of all I do not think it deserves to be so high on that ladder. IMDb 250 is not so, according to my opinion, relevant to which films are so good. Some I would not put there, like this one.Yes, the cartoon was excellent, quality of it was outstanding. But I found plot too much for the kids. It was not for the adults like me, so I recommend you give it to the kids to watch and you take your wife out for a good dinner.Kids will be mesmerized by all those monsters and witches, but do not be crazy when kid wakes you up screaming frightened. ;)",5,4,9,27 February 2014
The Usual Suspects," I was not impressed except for Kevin Specey*s acting.
","I was very surprised to find out that this film received such a high grades. Yes, the plot is interesting, it was funny during line up and acting by Kevin Spacey. All acting by Kevin Spacey is excellent. In every film I watched Kevin Spacey I was astonished to see how excellent actor he is.Yes plot is interesting and there are interesting twists and turns during the whole film, but it was nothing that spectacular. The film is fast paced that is for sure and editing is excellent, no wonder it won an Oscar for it, but otherwise it is just an ordinary thriller.I strongly recommend that IMDb people reconsider such a high rating of this film on its list of the top 250 films.",6,0,2,18 April 2014
The Duchess," Great period drama!
","This film was awarded an Oscar for the costimogrpahy. It certainly deserves it. It is an outstanding achievement, not only in costumes, but plot is interesting and acting is excellent.It is interesting that aristocrats could choose to live basically with two women. And then the wife falls in love with a politician. What a plot! And again it is a male heir. Henry VIII repeats itself over and over again. It is interesting to see how England was changing together while America was gaining its independence. Interesting period, interesting story.If you are into British Aristocracy and period dramas this is a film for you.",7,0,0,15 April 2014
Quantum of Solace," World is changing...
","This Bond film is not up to par with the changing world. It tries to keep with the classical Bond ways, but world is changing so fast that the plot looks a little bit out of date. I understand that, it is difficult to make a Bond film with all the glory and posh while millions of refugees are pouring into Europe and America. I mean, really you can not show Bond helping Syria refugees in the refugee camps trying to feed them or cloth them. It would not really have the glamor West is so hard trying to preserve.So let us say this is not my favorite Bond film, but I love Judy Dench in role of M. She kinda won my heart. ;)",6,0,4,27 March 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Very nice!
","First, before I go with the review I want to say that just before I entered the movie theater I met Oscar winning director Danis Tanovic. We watched the movie and no one noticed he was present. Where can you watch the film with Oscar winner and do it without pomp and ceremony? Danis you are just a great person, as well as director.As far as film goes it is another Lord of the Rings film. Yes, visual effects are great, the story is great, that it seems to me that these films will enter film history as the best films ever made. I do not agree with that, there were better films, but these films are so very popular with the film audiences all over the world!Very enjoyable to watch!",6,4,16,13 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," Warm film abut illness.
","We forget about people struck with illness, and this film came along to remind us about people who are in the midst of it all. I liked this film. Acting is truly excellent, you can feel the chemistry between two principal actors. Plot is interesting, although I am not sure is it realistic, with going to Amsterdam and all, but you have to make interesting film like this for the wider audiences. Otherwise, it would not probably be interesting for them.I also liked the music.If you have a sick member in your family this is a film for you, otherwise you could watch it for fun, you might like it like I did.",7,1,2,6 June 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," It was OK!
","I thought that the Lord of the Rings was done when the third film came out, but they decided to continue with the Hobit trilogy.When you saw three films of the Lord of the Rings you think you saw them all.This was enjoyable to watch, kids had fun.Visual effects are fantastic! The whole film was excellent from the beginning to the end.But as I said when you saw one you saw them all.Gandalf and Bilbo again and again.Trying hard!Really hard! :)",7,0,3,13 December 2013
Before Sunset," Paris we love!
","What was the beginning of a good idea about romance on a train entering Vienna, became an excellent idea about continuation in Paris, and later film Before Sunrise made an excellent trilogy. What an idea! To follow two people over a period of more then 20 years! And make a trilogy about the whole thing! It is not only a story about two people, but also a history of Europe during these 20 years.This film is full of beautiful intellectual dialogs and beautiful shots of Paris. I really enjoyed all of this.This is an opportunity to congratulate all involved in this project. Beautiful idea turned into a great project(s)!",7,0,0,22 October 2014
Non-Stop," Excellent airplane film!
","I loved flying. Before. Now I hate it. It is more dangerous then first thought. It is not the planes, they are safer now then before. It is the people. Flying public has changed. And I do not like it, plus I do not like some of the pilots. Some of them I do not trust.Do you think it was a coincidence that LH 370 was lost on the same day when this film opened in Vietnam? At the right point of crossing from Malayisan into Vietnamise airspace? I do not think it was a coincidence. Unfortenatelly, in this case Hollywood*s power showed itself to be fatal to some 200 plus passengers of a doomed flight. Such a pity! Planes were designed to connect people and make them love each other. Over the years they became deadly weapons.As far as the film goes, it is a very entertaining airplane film, acting is excellent, Liam Neeson has become a great star. I love watching films where he has a role like this.This is a perfect opportunity to ask airplane manufacturers to make flying even safer.",7,3,6,28 March 2014
The Pianist," No words to describe...
","how fantastic is this film.For a long time I wanted to write a review about this film. The warmth and suffering which comes out from the screen is unspeakable. It can be just compared with suffering of Roman Polanski in his life. What a tragic life, still it ended with a happy ending. Roman did not go to the USA for an unimportant thing he did in 1970s. He had a sex with a wet and willing minor. Who would not? Worse of all they wanted to lock him up for five years, he would serve sentence in the same jail where sentence is serving murderer of his pregnant wife, Manson. USA, helooooooo? What is it with you? Your legal system did not perform well in this case. For more details please look at an excellent documentary made about the case.Roman thank you for existing! I am your soul mate! I never met you although I spent some time in Paris looking for you but did not have chance and honor to meet you.In this film there are a lot of autobiographical elements of Polanski, you can feel it. Prosecuted men during whole of his life, a true Le Miserable, prosecuted and persecuted by many Jan Valganes. But with this film he resurfaces as a true hero of humanity. A winner! A true one! Leader and a hero with millions of fans of his work. I wish you many successful films like this in the future!",9,1,2,22 January 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Art in its full glimmer!
","There is an art in film, and there is a film as an art, and there is a film as art masterpiece. There you have it folks! Forget the Mona Lisa and all those boring paintings, forget solo music concerts. Here you have it all! If there was a film which made film making an art above all arts this is it! Everything about this masterpiece is superb. Acting, dynamic plot, music, cinematography. You name it they delivered! There is not much more to say then outstanding, superb, film as art above all! I hope they will make more of those, in the future they will say, mankind in the beginning of the 21st century made some history! If only Stefan Zweig could awake and see united Europe he dreamed of, and perfection of good life and welfare of its citizens he would be pleasantly surprised. Stefan, rest in peace Europe is living best it ever lived, rich and prosperous and almost fascist free! Hardly you can have it better then this!

The Transporter," It is OK action film!
","Usually I do not watch these types of films, but this one was recommended to me by a friend so I watched it.It was OK action film. Scenes of car chases are excellent. So is the scenery of the Cote dAzur. It brings back memories of those times I spent in Sant Tropez swimming and chasing young female tourists. Those were the times. Aaaaaaaaaa. Well it still happens every summer, I wish European summers were longer, for they pass way too quickly.Acting is good, the actors were not up to my high standards.Tho plot is typical for these types of films, what can I say.If you are into these types of films, this is the one to choose.",6,0,0,20 January 2014
City of God," Outsdanding work!
","As this film started my expectations were low. As it progressed I saw how excellent it is.It portrays so well violence in favellas of Rio de Jenerio and violence in general.Plot is a plot of violence and murder. Yet so simple but so well done. Directing is excellent so is the camera work. I was really impressed by all the action. I have to pay a tribute to this film especially because it is not American made.Acting is excellent, what else to tell you then it is a must see. Especially for you who do not like the subtitles. Please make an effort to see this film. It definitely is worth it.",8,0,1,25 April 2014
Gone Girl," Relatively disappointing!
","I have to say that I was disappointed with this film. Plot is not realistic at all. It is well disconnected from real life. I really think that at least eighty per cent of this plot would not happen in real life. When such disconnection happens in a film then it becomes big disappointment for me.I also have to say that I was not very impressed with acting, although some actors with minor roles did a very good job. For example, a couple that robbed main female character of her money. Also a female police officer is an exotic character with her coffee mug.Otherwise, I will quickly tend to forget this film! I apologize to the people who liked this film so much, but I did not. I mean there were some good parts, like when she was on the run, in that white trash house mingling with that couple, but otherwise not really that interesting or fresh.",5,12,37,4 October 2014
Insidious," How many of these were there in 2013?
","How many of these films were there in 2013? I saw so many I can not remember the number.I mean they are more or less entertaining but I think too many of these were created in 2013.This one is excellent, first of all house looks fabulous inside and outside. Furniture is beautiful and the whole set is something to be commended.The red corridor, hm. It reminds me on those red corridors in the red light district of Amsterdam, where instead of supernatural you find prostitutes. ;) Acting is excellent, although the husband character is something I leave for you to make judgment on. And the guys who are helping, they look like guys from your local supermarket delivering goodies.If you like supernatural films year 2013 was a year for you for many titles to choose from. You can choose this one as well.",6,1,3,1 February 2014
The Lives of Others," Outsdanding look at the GDR before the Wall fell!
","In 1984 I was a teenager in Sarajevo being entertained by the Winter Olympics of that year. I could never think that life in the East Germany was so not free. We were never told about this in the former Yugoslavia. Since we had a free travel possibility to the West, GDR considered Yugoslavia a capitalist state?!? Only after the Wall fell we understood the real horrors which East Germans who did not follow the Party line had to endure. At the same time it was very interesting how those who followed the Party line enjoyed good, almost an excellent life.At the same time it shows how the ones who were high, fall so low as the system changes. And the ones who were low climb high. (Who was high falls really low, and who was down climbs really high, wheel of fortune does not stop rotating!)All in all an excellent film, for all those interested in the GDR and Stasi it is a must see!",8,2,3,16 April 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," What can I say?
","When I started to write reviews about films on the IMDb I never thought I would stumble onto the film made for me. Well this is the one. Why do I had to escape? I had so I would live to see this film.The film describes well male wish to escape every day life. Many men do, some do escape, some do not. But this film is for the men who escape daily horrible reality. Usually it is not so horrible, but some of them can not cope. Usually they do not have the money to escape, but they still do. I find them crawling daily in the poverty which happens so regularly after they escape. Well babes you can day dream if you have enough cash to do that, if you do not you will find yourself digging garbage somewhere for food trying to survive.Well I really want to thank all that contributed to this film, and they made it according to my biography. I especially want to thank Kristen Wiig who performed so well Space Oddity, on her behalf I dedicate it to the new generation of BHS students, code name Matic ;) Lots of kisses and hugs from my tin can :)",9,0,2,6 February 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Second!
","This one was for a notch better then the first, ah that battle for Isengard! What can one say about these films except outstanding, fantastic, entering film history for ever. These films will be watched long after we all are gone from these Earth, just like Charlie Chaplin stayed for ever a classic! Not the best comparison, but classic is a classic!It definitely had me watch for the third part, I was sitting and waiting for a full year.Gandalf!Fights for good!And good will win in third!",8,0,2,13 December 2013
Schindler's List," What can I add?
","I wanted to write something meaningful about this film what it was not said before. I really do not have anything to add. Everything was said already. I should of given it 10/10, but I only gave that to one film and that is Nicija Zemlja. I know, may be it should of been reverse but it will have to stay that way.I am so angry with my parents. That they brought me to this world. I am even more angry that I fathered Theodore and Ian. I so much agree with Branko Lustig, God does not exist. Why do we repeat same mistake over and over again? Create children in such numbers that they will become adults and then die either by violent death or in bed? I am so angry, that each night before I go to bed I yell Heil Hitler and Sieg Heil and Deutchelland uber alles. My neighbours think I am crazy, but I am not. I am just so so angry! Inevitability of dieing is always there. From the moment I learned about this world I knew we will all perish sooner or later.So many books were written and films made about Holocaust and WWII that there is not much to add. That word Endoslung is the word. The final solution! After we clear Germany of that pestilence, we will live in peace and have plenty. We will rise our Ariyan children and be happy, we will not work much, Eastern Europeans will work for us in our Lebensraum and peace will prevail on Earth. But it is interesting, those Ariyan children would grow up and die, where is religion in all of that? Nazis did not have the time to think about that. Croatia is closest to what we have to that so called perfection. But you know what, I would rather not live in that perfection, if that is how perfection looks. If those shits refuse to come to Branko Lustig*s screenings and they are afraid of the truth which he is now spreading like mantra: God does not exist! then I do not want to be part of that perfection.Next time you put your penis into vagina and start doing that fantastic thing, I want you to think of Hitler or even better Himmler, I want that cold face to spoil your sex every time! There is no hope! We will all die, and our children will and their children will too. There is no God! Fairy tale!Heil Hitler! Sieg Heil! Good night and good bye! For ever!",9,9,13,5 March 2014
The Mist," What a horror!
","I liked this horror film. It was very interesting and innovative, with a lot of interesting twists and turns.Plot is interesting, it is not of course about mist but rather about the people and their acting in the stressful and unpredictable situations. It really well portrayed how some people can not handle these kinds of situations. Especially is interesting religious woman. When people have no escape they revert to religion. When they can not explain unexplainable they revert to religion. All the time there is someone who will try to escape that way, however the only escape she achieved was that a bullet came into her head.Acting is different from an actor to another actor. I will not single anyone out, because they succeeded to work well as a crowd.All in all if you like Stephen King, like I do, you should see this film. It is a lot of entertainment.",7,1,3,14 March 2014

And to put them together, what an idea! The plot is interesting and the whole film is fast paced, it is full of ideas and dynamic twists and turns.They blew hotel Adlon where Fuhrer liked to stay, and where I used to drink beverages with my children! Shame on you! Just kidding! Three months I spent in that city were probably the best months of my life!BERLIN! A place to be! I strongly recommend that you see this film!",8,1,2,27 November 2013
No Man's Land," Masterpice in every way!
","This the only movie I will rate 10 out of 10. Why you will ask yourselves? It is simple. I had the same idea, and if I became a movie director I would of made that film.I knew Danis Tanovic since we were teenagers. He is a great person in every sense! A real gem of this world, rare to find in this dangerous world of ours. Since the war came to our unfortunate land I came up with the idea for this film and idea for a movie that later became Circus Columbia. I told Danis if we are to survive the war he or I will make those films. He went on to be successful movie director and I well, film critic on IMDb.com. I did not think that Danis was to succeed. There was so much going against him. Serbs wanted to get a piece of his Muslim butt, like all Muslims he was a target to be executed when captured by the remnants of the Yugoslav Army which quickly turned into Serb Army. Luckily that did not happen, Serbs failed to kill or chase out of Bosnia-Herzegovina all Muslims and Croats they wanted to. And look at him, Danis is an Oscar winning movie director! What to say but congratulations and felicitations! The film is perfect in every sense, a true anti war film. It makes you wish that people should not wage war on each other, but it seems impossible wish. The only way to experience that masterpiece is to watch the film yourselves. Pleaase make your lazy Anglo-Saxon butts read and understand the dialog. It really is a gem! And if you want to find that no mans land in the real life take a drive between Trebinje, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dubrovnik, Croatia. It is a true no mans land!",10,1,4,12 October 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Fun!
","I loved it! Yes, it is made for the family audiences but it really kept me going for two hours! It is an action filled adventure on the high seas from the times when Britannia ruled the waves. It has it all! Action, pirates, sailors, ghosts and what not, but it really is entertaining! You have no other option but to take your kids to this one, you will not be sorry.I especially liked Mr. Bardem as Captain Salazar, his acting is a little bit better then the rest but every actor gave hundred percent for this film and it shows! Since this is my review 400 for IMDb.com I have to take an opportunity to thank staff at the Multiplex Cinema City Sarajevo for being generally kind and professional. Not to forget Meeting Point Cinema as well. I also want to thank IMDb.com staff for letting MOST of my reviews pass.",8,182,333,29 May 2017
Wimbledon," Relaxing fun!
","I enjoyed this film. I always loved watching Wimbledon and this film reminded me of Goran Ivanisevic winning Wimbledon as a wild card some years back. I wonder how much this story was inspired by that event? In any case plot is connected to those two weeks in Wimbledon when tennis comes to town. I am glad that we have a film which portrays all those events.I remember when I was there in 1994 and tried to get in, but I was not able, could not find a ticket, and I did not feel like lining up for one, pardon queuing. I watched all on the screens outside. It was a lot of fun! I thank the actors for acting well in this film. I really enjoyed Peter character played so well by Paul Bettany, after all I could of been that Peter in a different life, eh? ;)",7,2,2,11 October 2014
Lincoln," Lincoln!
","I like watching films about American Presidents.They always win! So did Lincoln in this film.We all know American civil war well.Even us who did not spend whole our lives in the USA.We all know role that Lincoln played in the war and how it went.This film portrays well those years it covered.Watch this film, because you need to know what happened during those years, it was so fantastic and unexpected. Nobody expected that North would defeat South. Hm, did they really need to? Those southern states are good for nothing anyways. Except Florida, good for swimming and snorkeling. :)",7,0,1,3 January 2014
Big Hero 6," Children liked it, I did not especially.
","Children that watched this film liked it very much, they were glued to the TV all the time projection was going on. They really were into it. They were a little bit slow to follow plot, but who cares! It was the animation and music which attracted the children. Big whit blob! I really tried to pay attention to the film, but since it really did not make any attraction to me I decided to go get some popcorn and soda for the kids. They really enjoyed it. I mean the whole package, movie, popcorn and soda. Other things they did not care much about. That is why there are grown ups like me to take care of the other things. Lucky them! They should enjoy their youth while they can.",5,11,47,27 April 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," This high grade? Hm?
","I was surprised to find this film so highly graded, I do not think it deserves such a high grades.First I have to talk about Visual and Special effects. They are fantastic! The models of ships, that scene with locking of ships together. Superb! The people who were in charge with doing all of that. They really need to be commended and awarded.Plot is not so good. I did not find it original. Dialogue was bland and not funny, although they tried to be funny, but were not successful. I was not happy with all of that.Acting was not so good either. They tried to invent something new with colorful types but I was not impressed.And once more, I left the theater without being happy. I felt I saw all that before.",6,2,6,8 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Enjoyed it, but not to the highest levels.
","I enjoyed this film for its excellent actors, and plot was interesting too. However, I was surprised to find that it had such a high review score, I think, because of its historical inaccuracy I was not that impressed about that fact. I usually do not like films which are not historically inaccurate.I would also like to concentrate on the story behind the story and that is the homosexuality of Turing. During those times they prosecuted homosexuals and today we have legal gay marriages in many countries. It is inevitable to draw a parallel with prosecution of pedophiles today. It does make you think, doesn*t it? In British society today, it is probably worst crime of them all.I also noticed that a lot of people from the former Yugoslavia worked on the film, a lot of ić ending last names, that is a mark they are from these necks of the woods.All in all I recommend that you see this film, you might like it more then I did.",7,0,7,2 January 2015
The Hangover Part II," Did I have to watch this?
","Hangover part I was bad enough, this was even worse. I am glad that the razzies recognized that and nominated this film for their not happy award.Well, plot was interesting, Thailand and all, everything was imagined well, but it did not give me as many laughs as in the first part. So for the plot one grade lower then the first part.Acting was also not that good. Actors tried to make out of an awful plot something interesting, but it did not turn out to be that interesting. Failed! Please, do me a favour and unless you really want to mistreat yourself, you might as well skip this film.I would of, but kids really wanted to watch this.Waste of time!",2,1,2,15 March 2014
The Dark Knight," Delivered more then I expected.
","I have to say I am not a big fan of Batman films, but since I watch so many films I watched this one too. I was amazed about the whole thing when I watched it. I watched it as a summer blockbuster and I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. Acting was excellent and crisp, plot was, ah well a Batman plot and visual and special effects are so fantastic that it mes this film real pleasure to watch.Since it passed some time since I watched it the last time I do not have much to add to the laudeamus of other critics and reviewers, so I will have to ask you to read them as well for the specific things which you would like to know about this film. Sufficient to say that I had to buy a Batman suit and a small car for my little one to make him happy for months...",8,1,2,6 February 2015
Taken," Good action by Liam Neeson!
","First of all I have to say that I love the shoes. Liam wore nice shoes, people who abducted her daughter wore nice shoes too, good job by the people dressing the actors, what is the word costimographers.The plot is a standard action film with some parental involvement. Selling virgins to the rich Arabs? I do not know it is a little bit clichÃ©... Too much blood and too many dead people, I did not like that much violence...It is not very realistic plot. I do not like that.Liam Neeson is fabulous like he always is. Other actors are excellent as well, especially actors acting Albanians.Paris is beautiful like it always is. I am glad that this film is focusing on waves of East Europeans and other foreigners coming to find luck in Paris, and finding corruption and problems. Paris has no room for all those who want to find happiness in it. Parisiennes hate foreigners and other French people. The only thing they want to see is the seaside and skiing twice a year. Rest does not interest them.",5,1,2,2 February 2014
Selma," Historic film.
","When I talked to my young kids about Dr. Martin Luther King they paid attention. They were fascinated with his struggle to make all people equal. They were especially fascinated by his speech: I have a dream! There children eyes sparkled with hope about better future. Of course, kids grow up, and they see that it is not all black and white. I think my younger son is still captivated by him, since he holds his picture on his skype main page.This film is fine portrayal of the part of that struggle for the black people in the USA in the 1960*s. I gave this film a high grade because it deserves it, since everything is excellent in it.If you like historical films, this is a film for you, otherwise you might just watch it anyways. You might learn something.",8,1,2,25 March 2015
La La Land," I loved it!
","Hollywood makes a film about itself from time to time. This is one of these kind of films and I loved it. I am not sure was the La La Land portrayed well in this film, for I never went there. It seems it was not, according to other reviewers but it was not that important. What was important was to make a film about the La La Land so people understand how actually it is difficult to make it there. I think this film makes a good case about all of that. Dancing and singing not in the rain but on the Californian sunshine is excellent and anyone who wants to see a musical should like this film. It was like watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers again in some futuristic remake. So for the sake of relaxation and good mood go and see this film.",7,1,6,12 January 2017
Sinister," I was not very impressed!
","When I take a horror movie to watch, I just do that, I try to watch and be impressed. But since I saw Conjuring earlier, this film reminded me so much on it. Since this film came out before Conjuring it is obvious that makers of Conjuring did copy this a little bit, took some elements out of it.What to say. acting was excellent, the idea that kids can hurt you is excellent. In real life they kill their parents on a day to day basis. Oh my God, all that money I spent on diapers and braces and other kids stuff, it certainly killed me little by little. Scary moments were excellent. But, in total just another horror movie. If you like them watch this one!",5,0,5,24 October 2013
Life Is Beautiful," Is it that beautiful?
","I had fun watching this film, but I was not so extraordinarily impressed as other people did about the whole project. I guess because Holocaust is so overly done that even a cute comedy/tragedy can look same as the other films made about the subject.Yes, acting is excellent, and the plot is interestingly imagined, that it really makes it very interesting to watch, but I simply was not so impressed as other people were.I recommend that you watch this film if you did not already, I guess in 1999/2000 everybody had to, it was that type of film and year.We will remember as Mr. Benini was jumping all over the chairs as he made his way to receive his Oscar.",7,1,1,16 March 2015
A Clockwork Orange," Fantastic film!
","So much was being written and said about this film, I have very little to add. Except to concur with those who wrote that this film is an astounding achievement! It absolutely is! Every scene is a masterpiece! Music is so well chosen! Acting is outstanding! What else can I add to praise this film? More then 40 years have passed since it was made and excellence of it is like it was made yesterday.I enjoyed it so much that I watched it several times, a very rare occurrence for me.It is simply a must see, especially for the students of film making! No it is just a must see! WITH EYES WIDE SHUT!",9,1,4,29 May 2014
Stalingrad," Excellent!
","It is a great portrayal of battle for Stalingrad. As I write this Stalingrad now known as Volgograd is attacked again, by new enemy, Al Qayida from East Caucases.There is nothing better to portray this battle then scenes from this film. It is funny, that fountain with people dancing is still a center of Volgograd, and the battle was fought around it.What in the hell made Hitler send his armies that far away? I guess the crazy idea was to join with advancing Japanese armies somewhere in India. Idiotic and crazy! Just as Hitler was. Idiotic and crazy! If he every took a train from Berlin to Moscow he would never thought about advancing towards the East that far. I know Lebensraum and all, but it was crazy!",7,0,1,30 December 2013
Pulp Fiction," I watched it few times again and again!
","When I saw this film the first time I went wit my mother to see it. She said after we watched it:' I do not understand this at all. I did not like this film!' I have to say that argument ensued, because I liked it very much. Actually, when I saw it that time I thought it is a masterpiece. I still think that way, although after so many years have passed I think some of the famous lines from the film were and are still quoted and used too many times in many shows and other films for that matter.There is nothing much I can add about plot, famous lines, acting, which was already said about all of this. Except that I second all the things said about great things which were achieved by this original script and acting. With this film, film making was moved one inch forward if not many more. Great!",8,0,1,18 October 2014
Les Misérables," Let us hear the angry people sing!
","From the moment I saw the original musical on Broadway I fell in love with Les Mis! I am so glad they decided to bring it to the film so the future generations can enjoy all that glory and music this masterpiece of the World Heritage brought to us! What is better about this masterpiece, is it the plot, the music or acting? What can you add about a classic like this except Bravo! Bravissimo!!! I can spend many more lines praising this masterpiece above all, but why should I do that, when all the best was already written about Les Miserables! Loved it, watched it many times over, with the kids and without them! So please do the same! It really belongs to the highest levels of human achievement in art!",8,1,1,16 March 2014
Thor," I really liked it!
","I do not know why but I really enjoyed this one. Much better then the sequel.Visual effects were wonderful and plot is well thought out.Acting is excellent like always it is when cast is good as it is in this film.Let us have teach young people a little bit about Viking mythology, why not? Music is excellent and especially sign off titles music is excellent as well. And a small twist at the very end! It is for you to discover...I would strongly recommend you see this film, you might enjoy it. I usually do not enjoy all of them so much but this one has an appeal!",8,0,1,6 December 2013
Enemy at the Gates," At one moment I liked it, but...
","I liked this film, but then they created computer game about it. My kids were crazy about that game, they just would not stop playing it. It made me sick to my stomach.Film is really well made. Acting is excellent, and special effects are great. I really enjoyed it, and if you did not see it already you should.Stalingrad today named Volgograd is facing attacks again, this time enemy is coming from the East in the name of Al Qayida. Who would think that such a city becomes from time to time in the center of the geopolitical fight. And is not that strategically located. Svata!",7,0,3,30 December 2013
The Departed," A lot of great actors together.
","What this film offered us was a very interesting plot together with a lot of good actors all together trying to snatch that Oscar(s).As far as the plot goes, it is a very interesting idea and you have to push yourself together paying close attention in order to follow the plot. It is obvious that this film was carefully made in order to win some awards, and I have to say that I am glad that it did win some Oscars, although I am not sure that it deserves all of them.When you put all these great actors together you will obtain some great acting, but I have to say that Jack Nicholson is my favorite. I am so glad he did not end up like Roman Polanski when all that case evolved.All in all I recommend this film, although I do not think it is a must see.",7,0,2,13 May 2014
Die Hard," An excellent action.
","This film is probably studied by the students of directing for being how action movie should be made. Everything about it by this time became classic. Watching it from this day and age it is obvious that times have changed, but action still remains crisp to this day.The plot is nothing which was not overachieved in the later films, but it is still interesting, although character of the black policemen is something to be desired.Acting by Bruce Willis became classic, other actors are also excellent, especially actor acting the main bad guy.All in all it is not amazing that this film achieved so much, it deserved at the time.",8,1,3,15 April 2014
Jersey Boys," I did not like this film very much.
","I am sorry, but I did not grow up during Jersey Boys. I am of a poor knowledge about this group or how it started. So I did not like this film very much, since it did not bring memories. I am indifferent about the script and editing, I am also indifferent about directing, since I did not like this film very much. I will probably forget it pretty quickly. If you are a music lover or fan of the Jersey Boys this is a film for you, otherwise I could not recommend it to the wider audiences.Since I did not like it very much, there is nothing further I should add.",4,1,4,5 June 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," Very interesting and informative!
","From the moment I started living in the USA I knew something like 9/11 was going to happen. Back then we did not know that AlQayida was going to happen. Actually we did not know how to call it. We knew there was some terrorist group which wants to convert the USA to Islam, if not peacefully then by some kind of massive terrorist attacks. We had no idea how those acts would look like, but we knew something was going to happen. I almost went to Australia, since ex Yugoslavia was at war, and I could not go back there. I wish I did go to Australia. Here I sit in my apartment in Sarajevo and think of the madness and pain AlQayida has put us all thru. If there is hell I wish they all end up in there! As far as film goes, since plot is according to true events, I can talk about acting. Acting is really good, concerning the subject.All in all it is a must see.",7,1,4,18 March 2014
12 Years a Slave," Excellent story of pre civil war America!
","What is amazing to me about this film is that it is based on a true story. I guess they had the people during those times who did abduct free black men from the northern states and brought them to the deep South to be resold into slavery. It is probably something that helped start the civil war in 1861.Story is fantastic, especially because it was based on a true story. I was amazed about that.Acting is really great and of course who will be the liberator but Brad Pitt, THE MAN! Scenery of DEEP South is also nice, I enjoyed it.Does it deserve all those Oscars it will get, I guess it does. After all the President is good nigge* ;) from Harvard. I guess we have to mark his time.",7,0,2,9 January 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Nothing short of a masterpiece!
","This film will stay in the history of the film making as probably one of the best war films ever made! I can not think of how to prise this film more. Where to start? Plot is so interesting, English war prisoners in the jungle trying to survive and at the same time building a bridge which would connect Bangkok and Rangoon and seriously threaten British influence in India.Dialogue is so excellent that sometimes it overachieves dialog of a war movie. That conflict between Japanese and British officer is quite an outstanding piece of plot, and support for a British officer is achievement for the film making and a show what stamina officers imprisoned had to endure.Acting is excellent especially by Alec Guiness.All in all this film remains one of the best films ever made.",9,0,1,18 April 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," What do I say further to praise this film?
","The only reason I did not give 9 out of 10 to this film is that it is now an old movie. Watching it during this day and age you can see how life and times have changed.I am really interested to see how this film influenced relationship between Polanski and Nickelson. I know Polanski did that fatal shoot inside Nickelson*s house, and that they were closely related during that incident. Who would ever think that Polanski would of been sent to a similar institution for a similar check up, as did our hero from this film? Something to think about, right? As far as film goes, a lot of it has been said about it, I will just repeat that it is a masterpiece. If it was not it would not sweep so many Oscars, so let us just do away with it. Fantastic!",8,1,3,14 April 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Something new and original!
","I will not keep a secret. I really liked this film and Tom Cruise is a shining star! This time shifting stuff was very original and I really liked it, otherwise plot was one of those war films type of plot. Nothing new about war plots, it is always war and murders and shooting and all of that type of things.If you turn on TV you will see live war from Gaza, you do not need to pay a ticket to watch war. Will it ever stop? I had a feeling that this plot was a little bit anti war, but I guess today you can not make a film without a lot of shooting and war, so people would watch it.It is a problem of today. People are acting too much like what they see on the films, and unfortunately Hollywood goes with the flow way too often. What a shame! Shame on you world!!!",8,1,4,31 July 2014
Downfall," Adolf Hitler
","Why will people remember Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler and not as an angel in Wings of Desire? Why do we always have to be impressed by evil and not good? Answer is simple. There is so much evil in this world of ours that being good is almost impossible, and being remembered for it. Yes the Nobel prize is there and all that, but Adolf Hitler impresses so many that even Emily Hartridge likes to talk about him.His story is actually a miserable one. Low ranking sergeant in the World War I, gassed, went crazy since that event, he obtained a feverish drive to make things right his way. His ambition was so strong and unrelenting that there was no one to stop him. Only old Hindenburg recognized the danger: I am not giving power to that Czech corporal! But he was too old to stop him. Von Papen even went to diplomacy to hide from a mistake of bringing Adi to power.Europe of those times was ripe for another conflict, not because people wanted it, but because of poverty and misery of too many people. Hitler said it was the Jews who were to be blamed about all ills of German society, but in effect, WWI impoverished German society so much that recovery was to be slow and ineffective. Only sexual energy turned into adoration of the Fuehrer could turn things around. It did, but with such a disastrous results.Watching last days of Hitler is so impressive, because everyone adored him so much around him that the world for some of them like Magda Goebels was impossible without Him and NazionalSocialismus. Nazis never thought they could loose, they thought they had Mesianic role in Europe. Boy were they wrong! Who flies high falls really low! I am sorry Mr. Ganz, you will be remembered as Hitler and not as an Angel! I am so sorry! Here I cry over your sacrifice and over all the victims in the World War II. Will my cry help the future victims of the wars? No.",8,1,3,6 November 2013
Whiplash," Disappointing!
","I expected from this film much more then I saw. I think music is not about military discipline and swearing, it is just the opposite. How important is for a drummer to play his drums fast? Not that important. I think this film was made more for the actors and music editors then for the music itself. What a disappointment! It is also disappointing to see that this film took more Oscars then Boyhood. It is sickening! I really would like to add that I really expected more about this film then it delivered to me. I am sorry but I would not recommend this film for you to see. It is just so disappointing.",5,23,41,30 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," An excellent masterpiece!
","There is not much to add about this film, which has been already said. Have you ever watch Barcelona play football? Well, this is similar in motion picture. Excellent work by everyone, excellent portrayal of Wall Street and its way of life. I wanted to have that kind of life, I went to the USA and New York City, but I was prevented from having it. It is a shame from people who consider themselves Wall Street insiders not to permit outsiders to get into their world.This film well portrays how few have a lot of money and they want more, and how they do not permit for outsiders to have a piece of cake.Acting is fabulous, Leonardo di Caprio matured to be one of the great actors of out time, directing is fantastic and all about this film is shining. May be for touch it is too long, but how can you tell this kind of story in short amount of time? Message for those who have so much money: Convert it to cash as much as you can and give it to those who need it. Not to the organizations, but to poor and those who can not make money for different reasons. To the individuals to solve their day to day problems. Don't overdo it, keep enough for yourself, how much you really need, but the rest you should give it away. You will make a lot of friends and happy people. :)",8,1,6,22 January 2014
American Gangster," Not very impressed!
","I was not very impressed with this film. I guess it is too slow for me.Acting is great, plot interesting but still too slow.I guess when you make a film according to a true event usually it is slow.Life is slow and it could be boring. Just as this film is sometimes.I wonder why it was nominated for so many awards, I would not give it so many, if any.I guess on a rainy day if you do not have anything better to watch this is a film for that. But you could skip it as well.I really do not know what else to add.Danzel Washington is great as he always is, otherwise it is a big yawn.Lots of guns and drugs I guess.",5,0,4,30 December 2013
The Green Mile," Very well made film!
","I was very interested to see this film, since I had no chance to see it many years ago when it came out.First of all Tom Hanks really sticks out from the other actors. He really is brilliant actor and here in this role he really shines! Other actors are OK, but he so much overshadows them that it really is interesting as a phenomenon.Plot has its ups and downs, I was not really thrilled with all that supernatural stuff, that healing and all. What I liked was the character build up and portrayal of the deep South mentality.I found the film a little bit too long.I can recommend this film but it is not a must see by all means. It is just a good film! If not for anything else it is worth watching for the acting of Tom Hanks.",7,0,1,23 May 2014
Jaws," We need to eat fish tonight! Some white!
","Tonight we grilled some fresh trout and watched Jaws. I looked inside teeth of a trout and did not find anything, but I looked up on the TV and wow, some teeth there! This is just on of those classics which made films so popular and worth watching.I loved it, from the directing of S.S.(Schutzstaffel), ha ha what a twist of history! I am so glad Steven that you were not one killed by those, hey who would of given us Jaws and all those other classics! ;)Music, ah, music! It is a tune for centuries! You make a classic movie and you become immortal! For you the younger generation, it is a must see!",8,1,4,4 March 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Very disappointing.
","I had enough of these Hobbits and Orks and all of that. I had to go see this film since my friend wanted to take her daughter to see it. Very disappointing I have to say.From the beginning of the Lord of the Rings saga I was interested to see all the films from the beginning to the end. This one is the weak link, simply because too much of the sequels have been made.Plot is, well is there a plot? It is just one long battle, the good guys win and the bad guys loose and that is it.Acting is OK, and visual effects are fabulous but with these types of films you just have to expect something like that.The most interesting part of the film for me was when Gandalf filled his pipe with the pot and lighted it up. Relax man and don*t shoot!",5,18,38,16 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I am big now, but I still love the Star Wars!
","Now I am not 10 years old any more, when Episode IV came out. It is amazing how much technology in the film making improved over many years.The opening shot is amazing, just as the Visual Effects of the rest of the film. It truly is something out of this world.Hovewer I could never be so impressed as I was with Episodes IV, V and VI. I guess children eyes will never come back, just as the eyes of Anakin will never be the same after THE MASK came on. I am glad that my children could enjoy these episodes as I did when I was of their age.There is not much more to say about this film. A lot has it been said, so I will just humbly take my hat off to everyone who participated in making this film. Simply outstanding!",8,0,1,29 March 2014
Inception," Complex and interesting, but...
","When I saw all the ratings and reviews of this film I was not sure do I like it or not. Well, some things I did, others I did not.I constantly had a feeling that plot is not really there. Or if it was there it was put behind all the action and visual and special effects, with what this film abounds. I have to say that I was very impressed with that part(s) of this film. I just would like that not all of it I could predict.Acting is excellent, but what else do you expect from a crew of actors in a film like this? I could not loose any sleep for not recommending this film. If you are into this type of films then you should see it. If you would like me to describe it in a few words then it would be: Pale copy of Matrix.",5,0,2,17 November 2014
Stalag 17," One of the first excellent WWII films!
","After WWII films dealing with the war itself started being made. This is an excellent example of that film making.I think every student interested in the war and POW thematics should see this film. It is one of the classics which was played over and over on many TV*s around the world. It is up there with the Bridge on the river Kwai.Plot is simple yet interesting. I loved in the old movies how film moved at the high pace, yet it was not a pure action film. In the modern films you have to have million bodies and million crashed cars to achieve that fast pace.All in all it is a must see, for all who love WWII themes and all who want to study film and acting.",8,1,3,25 April 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Yes it is a great film, but does it deserve to be number one?
","I watched this film several times and I am fascinated with it today as I was then when I watched it. Everything is top of the line. Acting, plot, camera, everything.Plot involving jail in 1940s is really an interesting plot and characters are really colorful. I think that was one of the films when Morgan Freeman came to fame. Other actors are fantastic too. This story is timeless and it will probably be watched many times over and over again by many people in the future.However, I am not sure that it deserves to be number one on IMDb top 250 films of all times. I would put Schindler*s list there rather then this film. But that is just me.",8,1,2,6 February 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Interesting insight into Broadway.
","After watching this film was puzzled why did they nominated it for so many Oscars. I mean this has some really excellent parts, but overall is not that outstanding achievement everyone is trying to portray it to be. At least I think that way. I am sure there are a lot of people who will disagree with me, but for the Oscar race in Anno Domini 2015, I would definitely opt for Boyhood rather then this film. Boyhood is far, far, far better film then this one.As far as this film goes, acting is excellent, plot is an interesting insight into Broadway. When I lived in NYC I went to watch Broadway plays a lot and I am glad they made a film which gives an insight into Broadway world. Very interesting. I also liked editing, like this film was supposed to be one long shot. It makes it even more interesting. Typical NYC, everyone is stressed out and busy, but they are not sure where they are going.I mean film is OK but is not that spectacular.P.S. She does not have a cool butt. I have seen many cooler ones.",6,0,5,1 February 2015
The Conjuring," Classic horror film
","What to say about this film? I think that visual effects are great, Hollywood went really a long way in that. It seems that every new movie has fantastic VE. The story, eh the story. I do not believe just one bit that it is the truth. I think the Lorraine couple are cheaters like anyone else who believes in paranormal. It simply does not exist.I mean they tried to make a Virgin Mary appearance a real thing in Medjugorije, but slowly as the threat of Communism wained down in the former Yugoslavia so does the story that Virgin Mary appeared in that small Herzegovina village. I know, I know they wanted some of the tourist money from the Adriatic coast to go to Medjugorije, but still, I mean Virgin Mary appeared to some young girls and talked to them, and still it like appears to them on a regular basis. Give me a break! So I am of the opinion that the Lorraines are out of job with new technologies appearing, they simply do not have material to prove their stories any more. So why not end with a big bang! A Hollywood blockbuster! There is some money in it that is for sure! They should be arrested for fraud! Hollwood makers should be congratulated for making a fine and entertaining film, that is for sure. Full stop.",5,0,2,12 October 2013
Prometheus," I liked it!
","I watched this film with my two boys and their friend. While my two beautiful boys loved it and enjoyed it, their friend was really scared. I did not think that new generation can be scared by these types of movies, but they can. So I was scared 30 or so years back when I watched the original Alien, so there are new scares for the next generation.I hear there is second part in the offing. Well it deserves to be. This film kept me glood to the screen so I hope that number two will as well. From the times of first Alien to this one we have a range of good and bad sci fi films, this one is very good. I am looking forward for number two.",7,1,5,19 November 2013
The Queen," Excellent!
","We rarely get a real glimpse in the life of the Monarchy, either by the way of media or film. Younger generation is more open to the public, as I write this review I see prince Harry going to the South Pole. We see more of them then we see older generation. That includes The Queen Elizabeth II. I am so glad that they make the films about them more and more so we can see what is going on.Helen Mirren gave a role of her life in this film! No way we can say the other way! What do we really know of Queen Elizabeth II? Very little. What I privately found out is mixed. She is very popular in the UK. People there call her Elizabeth The Great! Why did she deserve superlative like that? May be the events of Diana*s death changed her. Like of the royals they think it is their God given right to rule. May be it is. In the UK, they are very popular. I can not judge her. Only professional royal historians have right to do that. Only they have a right to judge her, since they have the access to her.Let us just say, it is a must see film and for the royal lovers is even more must see!",8,1,1,4 December 2013
Taken 2," I liked it better then the first one.
","And finally Rade Serbedzija! Where was he hiding all these years? He is so perfect as the bad guy, when in the reality he is such a great person! I wish they would give him a role of a nice guy! For once! Liam Neeson is fabulous, but he always is, I do not know the film where he was bad. Other actors are something to be desired.Plot is not that realistic and I do not like that. They could of made it a little bit more realistic, especially I hated when daughter was driving. I did not meet a woman who knows how to drive. So giving a prominent role to the women is nice but not like this. I am glad they touched into Albanian blood revenge, it is a middle ages custom.Shots of Istanbul are fabulous! All those chikmas and sokaks, ministry of culture of Turkey and scouting people did their homework! All in all good action movie! It is not a waste of time to watch it!",6,0,1,3 February 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," Not worse not best I saw.
","I mean this film is controversial from the moment it came into the movie theaters. Some people say it is the worse film they saw, other people throng to the movie theaters to watch it. In my local movie theater they told me that all shows are sold out. So the film is controversial.What is it about it that it makes it so controversial? I think it is the plot which is actually talking about new addiction to internet porn. Man, I had a feeling that I was watching a longer video from xhamster.com. Actually, a very long version of it. Since internet became so widely available, so did pornography of all kinds is easier to watch. Before it was not so easy to obtain porn so widely, now it is easy. So this plot reflects this new phenomena.Acting was OK, although not excellent, so it fits well in the grade I gave it.All in all, since this film is catered towards younger audiences I would recommend them to go and see for themselves do they like it or not. For you older ones not really.",5,1,3,19 February 2015
Casino Royale," I almost liked this film, but...
","To show Montenegro as a modern and prosperous state?!? Ha,ha,ha! I died of laughing! Montenegro is a backwater and a country full of savages! I hate that I went there, after the wars of Yugoslav disintegration. They are such savages that they attacked and pillaged suburbs of Dubrovnik in 1991, when Croatia was totally unarmed and not ready for war! I know, times have changed, just as Judy Dench said, God I miss the cold war! So do I my dear M, peace and calm of it. We the former Yugoslavs could of traveled and had more money during those times. Now we mostly have nothing.As far as film goes, I liked the action parts of it, otherwise I was not that thrilled with the rest. With exception of Judy Dench, she is such a darling! Although I am not sure that role of M suits he that well. I was surprised to find that this film received such great grades, I do not think it really deserves such a high grades.",4,3,8,20 March 2015
Before Sunrise," Vienna we love.
","It really is a nice plot. These types of things are not that uncommon or common in life. I do not know are these romantic things possible in the real life. I guess they are. Or not? It is up for a debate. But after all it is only a film. Vienna is a great set for a beautiful story like this.Acting is excellent, they act so well, it is almost as they are a real couple somewhere in Vienna.I can see that big question here is did they have sex on their first date? Does it really matter? It is not that important, their relationship will become more complicated as the time passes, in the real life these romantic beginnings end up as a disastrous divorces or break ups even before marriage.",7,0,0,22 October 2014
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Excellent!
","This one is a little bit worse then the Elizabeth but just for a notch. It still is an excellent film, and Ms. Blanchet is an outstanding actress.I think plot is a little bit more inventive then in the first film. It does not follow history to the letter, but in order for a film to be dynamic sometimes it is necessary for that to happen.Shinig silver armor, white cliffs of Dover, nobody loved you like I did speech, oh I know it is all a spin, but Elizabeth was close to a defeat by Phillip II, much closer then many want to admit. If the weather man came from our time, situation would probably be different. Did she really die a virgin, I wonder? Hm? Please see this film, together with part one.",7,0,0,15 March 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," Wonderful family film.
","It is a film for a hole family! First about acting. Tom Hanks is fantastic so is Emma Thompson! Absolutely they deserve Oscars all the time. What actors they are! Plot is very interesting. Was it all based on the true events? Wonderful! Very interesting for the whole family, I would not put a minimum age limit for the kids to watch it. Some reviewers did, but I would not. May be they could be bored a little, it is for the adults after all.It brought back the memories on all those Walt Disney films I watched as a kid. I wish it could all come back. I wish my kids watched more of it, it would of been better then those computer games they played.I strongly recommend this film, especially for the people who study acting, those two actors make the whole film worth watching.",7,0,1,18 January 2014
Thor: The Dark World," I liked it, but that is about it.
","This film has outstanding Visual Effects, just like any other high budget sci fi films coming out of Hollywood these days.I can not say that I adored the film, I liked it, it was entertaining and it was time well spent. But I was not thrown out of my seat. The mixture of Earth life and other worlds does not compute with me. How can you show all the minorities living in Greenwich in the film like this? Our world is so imperfect that I do not like mixing make believe super worlds like Asgard with this miserable one of ours.I really liked the mask of the main villain, what was his name? Acting was really good and humor is inside with a nice touch.I recommend for you to go see it, you will enjoy it. Time well spent!",6,0,2,17 November 2013
Lucy," Cool movie!
","I liked this film more then I expected I would. First Scarlet Johansson  is fantastic, she always was in every film I watched, I remember her  role in a girl with a pearl earring, and other films, she was so  outstanding. Here she shines two.   Acting a doctor fits so well Morgan Freeman, in those roles he is Mr.  Number One. I guess he will be remembered for these types of roles in  the history of film making.  Plot is very interesting and general audience have to use 1 per cent of  their brain capacity (usually they do not use any) to understand what  is going on.   All in all a very entertaining and enjoyable film. I recommend it!",8,4,10,7 September 2014
Amélie," Cute!
","A lot of good things were said about this film, so let me join the bandwagon and support those excellent reviews about this film.It is a very good portrayal of French girls. I had my own Amelie, her name was Valerie. I really am sorry that I did not marry her. I would have Paris and not Sarajevo. But USA was more interesting. If I knew how would of turned out there I would of chosen Paris. Well enough about me.Everything is fresh about this film.So many cute and funny twists in the plot. Gnome traveling the world. Fun! Amelie is such a character, there are no many like that.I loved every moment of this film, please make an effort to watch it, even for you lazy English speakers, watch it with the subtitles.All thumbs up!",8,0,1,27 February 2014
The Sixth Sense," Surprising ending!
","I found this film a little bit slow. I was surprised to see it so highly graded. And I was surprised to see that it was so popular at the time.Plot is interesting, especially twist in the end. Hovewer, I saw so many similar plot thrillers that this one somehow looks pale. Hovewer, it did pass almost 15 years since the time of filming of this film, film industry did change extraordinary over these years.Acting is excellent, by all the actors, especially by the little kid.I would not rate this film so high on the ladder of IDBM films 250. I do not think it deserves to be so high.",7,0,0,19 April 2014
Flight," I recommend it!
","I already wrote a review for this film and for some reason it was not approved by the IMDb crew for reason not understood by me. Or explained to me for that matter, it would be nice for IMDb people to explain why the do not approve a review.To focus onto the film.I love Danzel Washington, he acts so good and he is an interesting personality.Plot is very interesting and common in the airline industry. As I write this review planes are constantly landing at the wrong runways all over the USA, I guess to many airports. ;) Pilot do snap, they like stewardesses to have sex with, they drink, they sometimes use drugs, I loved scene when Danzel Washington is checking the oxygen mask. Sniff, sniff checks. Oh yes that O2, what a feeling! I loved scenes of the airplane crashing, very realistic and well done. All in all you should see this film, it is very interesting, talking about airlines, pilots and those cute flight attendants.",7,1,2,14 January 2014
Rear Window," To make a film in one block of NYC!
","Only Alfred Hitchckok could of made such a suspenseful thriller in one block of the New York City.You do not need to get out to the Himalayas to have an excitement. About the ending, it was a little bit disappointing and predictable, also it was too much snooping around the apartments, just like McCarthy liked it to do, but all in all it is a masterpiece.What I really like about the film is camera moves and play with light. It made film even more exciting.Grace Kelly shines in this film, so does James Stewart.All in all if you are a Hitchckok buff this is a film for you.",8,1,3,1 March 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Fantastic!
","Please note that I already wrote a review for this title but for some reason it did not make it to my review list. So here we go again.This is definitely one of the best films from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.There are so many excellent reviews about this film that I have not much to add.Visual effects are excellent, plot is excellent, acting is excellent.There is nothing else you can do then just lay back and enjoy a masterpiece like this.My friend who does not like the films in general actually bought dvds with all three of the Lord of Rings films.So it is a must see!",9,1,2,21 December 2013
Munich," Extraordinary!
","Every film made by Spielberg left a mark on me for good. That guy simply has all the talent and information and resources to make a good film. This film is no exception. Many things are said about Steven, but I just want to add this. He simply had all the best in him to make it to the top, not only in the movie making but in the American and civilized world. He is respected by many people, and rightfully so. Too bad we do not have more people like him in the world. World would of been a better place. However, I am not sure that is possible given state of the affairs in the world today. It is probably going to get worse, and I am afraid that a civilized part of the world is going to get more uncivilized. Unfortunately! As far as this film goes, everything was fantastic, from the beginning to the end, plot, acting, sets. The scene which will stick in my, and probably in everyone else*s mind is the scene of the murder of the naked Dutch woman.",8,1,1,12 February 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Contains spoilers!
","No it does not. I was just kidding! There was a line in the movie saying that it contains spoilers, but it does not. And it referred to a movie web page which I presumed they thought it was IMDb.I was disappointed about the film. I expected more. I was surprised that it got such a high reviews, I mean there were funny parts, but in general it was not very interesting to watch.Bloopers were the funniest part of this film and when that happens it shows that there is something wrong with the film.I mean I gave it 1 out of 5, and that is how much I think it deserves.That is all what I wanted to say about this film.",5,42,89,22 November 2013
The Matrix," Wow! I was stunned when I saw this!
","When I saw this first part of the Matrix series I was astounded! To say the least! I am not sure what impressed me more, was it the plot, acting or visual and special effects. I could write hours about the film and putting it into the stars, but why should I? All the praises were said about this film, and I read most of the reviews and I have to agree with most of the reviews praising this film.We would all like to be heroes of the Matrix, and sometimes in our conscience during waking up from the sleep we feel that we are somewhere else in some Matrix. During those very short periods of half consciousness which we feel we are not present we feel we are in some kind of Matrix. Tortured people, people in jails, soldiers in combat, people in a near death experiences, they are part of some Matrix.May be, just my be we are all in Matrix now without even knowing it. :)",8,1,3,10 February 2015
Godzilla," It is all about Visual Effects!
","This film was all about Visual and Special Effects! Plot was too thin and it seemed to me that I saw all that before. I wish I could say something positive about the plot but I am sorry, I just can not. It was a little bit too much repetitive from the previous films of this type. I liked the scene when the jump from the airplane, that was a little bit unusual and it had some appeal to it.Acting was something to be desired even for this type of film, no one really jumped out with acting skills. Fair but not fabulous.All in all it is a very entertaining movie and if you like non stop action with a lot of visual effects this is a film for you. I recommend it. It will be not a waste of your time.",7,3,7,16 May 2014
Looper," I did not particularly liked it.
","I was surprised to see that this film received so many good reviews and has a high overall grade. Although it wants to be an interesting and intelligent sci fi thriller, I think it fails that mission. I do not like particularly acting as well. Although Bruce Willis is very renown actor, I do not like his acting or films he participates in.In the beginning this film had some promising parts but quickly turns into shooting action film. It is fine by me who likes those kind of films but I thought that this film was supposed to be a sci fi film, which only is a friction of time.Altogether, I can freely recommend that you skip this film I barely waited for its ending.",5,0,1,7 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Memories from the childhood!
","Since so much was said and written about this film I decided to tell you how was it when I saw it the first time.I was 10 years old. Cinema was called Dubrovnik and the city was Sarajevo. Back then Sarajevo and Dubrovnik were two beautiful cities in the same country, Yugoslavia. Today they are not. Dubrovnik is in Croatia, and Sarajevo is a capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Well, in any case we had cinema called Dubrovnik in Sarajevo. It was located where today is a multiplex Cinema City in Sarajevo.Just like any kid of that age I was so scared of Darth Wader. Later I was more scared of the real Darth Wader (Dick Chaney). The Imperial music added to the scare. Later I learned that clones were the good solders of the Republic, but back then they were really scaring. Scaring as hell! Later in life I met so many scary people in my life, it is a miracle I am still alive, I escaped death at least dozen of times, and I am still here to write these lines.Chubacka was scary too, so did all other funny creatures from the café...I loved shape of the Imeprial star ships, and I was still wondering why princess Lea wore her hair the way she did.Concept of good and evil. I thought after watching this film that in the real life good will always triumph. Later I learned that good and evil are not as black and white as they were portrayed in this film. There are a lot of shades of gray. Funny, back then for some reason I wanted for the Empire to win, totalness of them was so calming, I felt if they won peace would come to that galaxy. Child*s mind. My sons were the same way, until I persuaded them that the princess Lea*s lower organs should be protected! I was so mesmerized by THE FILM that I watched it over and over, we started fan clubs which were not that happily looked by the Yugoslav secret service, but because they were also mesmerized by the film they tolerated it. Later when my sons fell in love with THE SAGA they were able to collect all the memorabilia, books and all. We were fighting with the plastic light sabras, that I almost got my eye poked out.So that how it was long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...",9,0,0,25 March 2014
300," Blockbuster historical drama.
","When I was in the elementary school we were thought about great battle of Thermopylae. I am glad that the new generations of elementary school children will be able to watch on the screen what we imagined in our heads while our history teachers thought us about this historical events.I have to say that I was very pleased at what I saw in this film. Everything was high class. From acting, cinematography to battle scenes and make up. Everything was really cool.So dear school children of the Greek history and not only you, there is an opportunity to make your imaginations come true and watch how it might of been.",8,1,2,21 November 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," I mean it is OK, but nothing extraordinary!
","I was surprised to find out that this film was rated 8 out of 10. I would not give it such a high grade, may be 7 out of 10 is more appropriate.The problem being that I saw so many films like this before, spy thrillers/comedies. I have to say this one brings in refreshment as far as the plot goes. It is very well thought out plot with very cool and sexy ending ;) Acting is excellent. I really liked all the actors who participated and they mostly did an excellent job.What I did not like was too many aristocratic sets, with leather chairs, fireplaces etc. Too much out of time and date. Times have changed. Somehow it does not fit in the modern world.All in all if you want to watch a fun film with action and comedy this is a film for you. Otherwise if you are not into James Bond films, you might skip it.",7,0,7,17 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Ah Darth I am in love with you!
","I was 13 years old, 3 years have passed since Episode IV The New Hope. After initial scare, I have recovered. I was explained that it is all make belief, and Darth Vader was not going to come and eat me for breakfast. I started expecting Episode V with great eagerness. What was it all going to be about? In our little Star Wars club in Sarajevo we obtained information that Episodes I, II and III will be made in a long distance future, and we obtained some short synopsis of what they were all going to be.After Episode V finally came out, we came to the cinema Dubrovnik and made a party while watching it. It was my first great teen excitement. After watching the film we talked at length about all of it and what we liked and did not like. I told my gang that I was sorry that the Empire did not catch all of the rebels and did away with them. Everybody looked at me with amazement. Why was I for the Dark Side? I do not know, they were just so sexy! So dark and total. To remind you we still lived in the what-was-left of Tito*s Yugoslavia and we had totalitarian minds. I wanted it to be all livada (use google translator)! Peace in the galaxy, for ever! Others were for the rebels, they were after all good kids of Tito*s partisans, antifascists! Later I went with them. I saw the light, rebels were the good guys, I guess.All in all as the good clone army we went the next day and watched the movie again. And again. And again. Numerous more times.That how it was long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...",9,0,0,25 March 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Great action film!
","If you are into action films this one is definitely for you! Non stop action, excellent visual and special effects makes this film a memorable one! You do not have to love action film to love this one! Everything is great about it, plot is certainly memorable, it is geared towards the younger audiences. Acting is great, both the principal characters and the the other ones are great in their roles.You have to love this film, if you get involved into the plot and it is interesting to watch all the way.I simply have to recommend this film for the action loving audiences, but you might just watch it for fun anyways even if you are not an action loving person. It certainly will make your time worthwhile.",8,1,11,13 June 2015
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Interesting try
","I wanted to write a lot about this movie but I read other reviews and I found out that they describe the film accurately so please read them. I really do not have anything to add to what other people wrote about it.What I wanted to write about is the actress Zana Marijanovic. Since I know her personally I have to say she is such a nice and positive person. When she was without a boyfriend I tried to ask her for a date. She refused me flat out. Of course, I am not from the movie/acting business, but I am her fellow Sarajevan. Still, even that I was not to her liking I still, when I watch her act either in Gogo club or in Kamerni Teatar, like her very much. She radiates with such a positive energy, and is such a nice person. She is a Bosnian mixture of Sandra Bullock and Angelina Jolie.",5,2,11,24 October 2013
Alien: Covenant," I am truly disappointed!
","I had big expectations from this film. I have to say that I am greatly disappointed.Plot is not interesting, I can not even to compare it to the Prometheus which was far better film then this one.I was so disappointed that I almost left the movie theater before it ended.Visual effects are excellent for that is expected of today sci fi films.Acting of Michael Fassbender is excellent, that is the highlight of this film.I would like to add some more to my review but I do not want to waste your time. If you are and Alien series fan you should go and see this film, but I warn you you will be disappointed. If you are not that kind of fan you can freely skip this one.",5,24,49,21 May 2017
Up in the Air," George Clooney is outstanding!
","This is an excellent film and it is not a wonder it received so many awards.It portrays modern American life and it connection and dependency on air travel. Well, it was made in 2010, few years after the USA recovered from the 911 attacks.Plot is very interesting and crisp. Scriptwriters spend good amount time and they really are smart people doing this script. It is not found that often that script is so well done and dialogue is smart, a little bit above the average.What can you say about acting? Except George Clooney others look so bland. He really is something else. I am so glad that he won so many awards including an Oscar for Siryana, he really deserves, before he goes for a deserved rest.I strongly recommend this film. Enjoy!",7,0,0,23 March 2014
Furious 7," I did not like this film very much.
","Yes there was a lot of action and a lot of crashing cars, trucks, and airplanes. Yes there was a lot of action and shooting and good guys and bad guys, but all in all I can call it just a good action movie. I saw so many of these, similar ones before, that I really can not be impressed very much with repeating action, which increasingly looks the same in all of these expensive action films. Scene, when car is crashing trough three towers is probably the most memorable one. Otherwise, all other scenes looked very much similar to other action films I have seen over the years. If you are a fan of high speed, lots of crashes and no brainier plot, this is a film for you, otherwise, you might freely skip it.",5,3,19,25 April 2015
The Godfather," I remember when I saw this film for the first time...
","This was a classic for me when I saw it for the first time, later I made all of my family watch it, we became true la Familia ;) not really a crime syndicate, but rather we loved what we saw in this film. I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder.",8,3,4,6 February 2015
