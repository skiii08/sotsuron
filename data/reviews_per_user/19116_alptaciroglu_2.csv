Sucker Punch," Outrageous.. Don't PAY FOR THIS!
","This movie totally mocks you for paying money to watch it.. It stinks from the start where you have a hard time trying to figure out the changes where movie tells the real world and where fantasy begins. Musics are just there because they apparently thought a movie should have musics on its background. Thema changes so fast both for musics and and for storytelling it literally tells you :'THIS MOVIE CONTAINS PRETTY GIRLS AND MEANINGLESS VISUAL EFFECTS TO MAKE PEOPLE WATCH'. Visual effects are meaningless because you feel to the core that they are there to fill the great hole that scenarists couldn't fill. They took random historical events, some mythological creatures/characters apparently because they thought It would look cool with the effects. This is an insult to those who try to put a good movie before the audience. If you have little respect for good-movie makers and If you have little respect to yourself don't pay for this movie.",1,7,14,18 April 2011
Thor," 'Marvel'lous Thor
","1- Let me say first that consider throughly and acknowledge you are going to watch a Marvel production before you go to this movie. If you don't like the genre and you are not bored to death or want to spend some time all alone&with friends do not pay for this movie.2- Now, for those who are interested in Norse mythology only but not Marvel comics, you may get disappointed because story has its inconsistencies like how Odin lose his eye not to mention Ragnaros. Hell even when Sif says 'I'd die a warrior's death' Thor, disagrees..3- Action scenes. I don't know if It was just me but 3D implementation to movie makes action scenes especially close combat scenes 'a bit!' vague. You don't know whats going on there. I mean seriously .. Other than these close combat scenes where camera angle is terribad 3D go along with the movie well.4- Humor: I think humor is well implemented in the movie. Makes you(me anyways) laugh often. Makes movie more watchable.5- Romance Scenes: Didn't like it a bit. Too hasty to happen anything. You do not understand the relationship between a god and a mortal. You quite put your finger at it. It makes you think that there is something missing in it. If you think yourself as qualified to watch from previous topics go ahead and watch this movie. I don't think anyone would dislike the movie just because of this.6- Overall: I myself, rate movies for a single fact. If I ever checked my watch in the cinema. Well I am glad to say I haven't. It was easy and entertaining to watch.",9,4,9,30 April 2011
