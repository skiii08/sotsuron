The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," epic !!
","I don't usually review twilight titles although I'm one of the biggest fans Like many others, I'm a twilight fan and i've loved every single movie released. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn part 1 is the most unforgettable, remarkable, and amazing movie out of the four , Breaking Dawn beats twilight , new moon and eclipse together , in my opinion its the greatest Twilight film . I would never complain about how the movie did not have enough 'details' because that it just something impossible to do without exceeding the runtime and also losing many audience who haven't read the book. By far, this is the greatest movie based on the Twilight series and after seeing this, one feels proud to have stuck with Twilight till the end. Watch it over and over again. It deserves nothing less. Bill Condon did an amazing job in this movie. rate +A",10,18,69,12 November 2011
