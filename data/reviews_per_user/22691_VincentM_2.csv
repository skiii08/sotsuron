The Blair Witch Project," An instant classic - original and thrilling
","You must see this movie! The scariness is all in the mind, it really makes you think. There's hardly any blood on the screen, you never see the witch. In fact I think the scores you give this movie are directly proportional to your IQ !!  Naturally, I give it a 10.Vincent's daughter Jessica says this- 'Seriously, I really liked this movie! It is a classic. It is not a boring, unoriginal horror like Scream which is basically a complicated and twisted storyline with lots of blood and guts to measure out the crappiness of it!! Any mindless gump could sit, watch and understand that type of rubbish!! The Blair Witch Project is the product of a real genius! This film was genuinaly scary in things that you wouldn't really think would be, such as the piles of rocks outside the tent. I found the characters brilliant and I could really relate and feel for all of them! The ending was amazing and really got the imagination working! People who don't like this movie have no imagination. I guess u don't like it because u have to think!!I give it a well deserved 10/10!!'",Null,0,1,30 April 2000
Edward Scissorhands," This really is an amazing movie!
","(written by Vincent's 13 year old daughter Jessica)This movie is wonderful! I have watched it only a few hours ago and cannot stop thinking about it. It has everything! Tim Burton has done a wonderful job. It was so sad but really beautiful! It was also really funny in places (when Mrs Monroe kicks her dog I couldn't stop laughing!)
It was so true to life.The suburben life everyone lived was freakily acurate! The way Johnny Depp acted as Edward was so touching. I had never really noticed what a fantastic actor he was.I don't really know what else to say about this movie that no one else has said! If u haven't seen it, go to the video store and rent it NOW!! It is such a good film. It will make u cry though! 10/10.",Null,0,0,18 November 2000
