Kill Bill: Vol. 2," QT's best since Pulp Fiction!
","I know that it is rare to have a sequel that is absolutely better than the first film. Many feel that Spider-Man 2 is better than the first. The same goes for The Empire Strikes Back being better than Star Wars, and Godfather 2 being better than The Godfather. And the reason why these films are viewed as superior efforts over their original counterparts is simple............these sequels have their own identity. They have their own story to tell. And that is exactly what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 better than Volume 1. True. It does continue from Volume 1. True, the theme for both movies is the same......revenge! But Volume 2 is not in any way shape or form like Volume 1. It possesses more depth than the first film had. And the dialog in volume 2 is the best I have seen in a film since Fargo (and that is saying a lot.). But what really sets this film above Volume 1 is due to one person............David Carradine as Bill.I loved how you never saw Bill's face in the first movie. This strategy only built up the anticipation for when you do finally see him.....which doesn't take long once Volume 2 begins. But how we first see Bill is where the tone of this film is set. He is calmly playing his windpipe, and once he turns to look at The Bride, he commands your attention from here on out. What really struck from his first five or so minutes on screen was how Carradine displays sadness, happiness, and anger all wrapped in one. We know that Bill is gonna kill her, but the way Carradine portrays it, you suddenly find yourself wondering if he really will. You also get the feeling that Bill does not want to kill her, yet he knows that he has to because (in his eyes) she betrayed him. I loved the final lines they shared at the church, where she asks him how she looks. He touches her and looks at her like he is a proud father, and tells her she looks like she is ready. That is powerful, and what is really great is how these two lines come up near the end of the film. Truly masterful.Uma is solid as The Bride, and she shows why she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today. She never gets the credit she deserves, and my hope is that these two films will give her that credit. Before these films came out, I had my doubts as to if she could pull off a performance like this. I'm glad to say that she proved me wrong. She is The Bride, and I don't think anyone else could have played her better.My only gripe with this film comes down to some believability issues. I won't go into any details, but you'll know what I am talking about. Still, these are minor gripes that do not take away from the movies 'greatness'.All in all, this is QT's best work since Pulp Fiction. I only hope he doesn't take another six years to make another film.",9,0,1,20 January 2005
Underworld," Excess bullets=Cool!!
","Why is it that most action movies these days have to have a scene in which thousands upon thousands of bullets are flying all over the place, and yet maybe one person actually gets shot? I guess action films are trying to get a high rating for 'coolness'. In the opening scene of Underworld, we are treated to a shootout between the Lycans (Werewolves) and the Vampires who are at war with one another. This shootout takes place in a subway station, with many, many helpless humans around. And guess what? Only one human actually gets shot. The other 100 or so people actually dodge or dive out of the way. And it ain't like the Lycans or Vampires are using six shooters either. These are full-auto guns, and as a result a gazillion bullets fly. Now, the shootout does look good, but the logic with it is just heinous. But then again, this is an action movie, so we should just enjoy shootout. But, I actually thought to myself, 'Hey! No wonder one side can't get rid of the other. They can't shoot a damn gun!'. But, and I have to state this so here is a MINOR SPOILER ALERT......when Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who is a Deathdealer for the Vampires tracks down a Lycan in the sewer shortly after the subway shootout, she nails the guy with three or four shots. In the Subway, she couldn't hit a damn thing (except for the walls and columns). I just had to point that out.In any case, aside from Underworld being a bit illogical at times, this is actually a good film from an entertainment point of view. Beckinsale does a good job playing her role. I was concerned that she couldn't pull it off, but trust me. She is Selene, and she looks good at being a bad-ass. Scott Speedman is......well........I just don't know what to think of him. I see a lot of potential in him, and he does a good job playing Michael. Michael Sheen as Lucian is great. I wish he would have had more screen time, but at least we get to know why Lucian hates the Vampires.Shane Brolly? He is the guy playing Kraven, who is the worst character in this film simply because I am convinced that Shane Brolly is one of the most horrible actors I have ever seen. I mean, Jean-Claude Van Damme could teach this guy a thing or two about acting. Brolly looks so much like Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) that I thought he was gonna break down and start singing 'Closer' at any moment. I realize a film like Underworld won't give you Oscar type performances, but this guy should never have been given the part of Kraven. Hell. Trent Reznor could have done a better job.Overall, Underworld is good for what it is. It entertained me, and has me looking forward to the sequel. It has its' holes and can also leave you confused at some points in the film, but the story does fill the holes (or it tries to). Get past the subway shootout and you should enjoy the rest of the movie.",6,7,13,19 January 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Another remake, but at least Dawn isn't all that bad.
","Hollywood is suffering from a new disease...........remakeitis! So far in 2004, we have seen remakes of Flight of the Phoenix, Stepford Wives, Walking Tall and Dawn of the Dead. And their are more to come in 2005, which tells me that ideas are scarce in Hollywood. I'm not dogging remakes. But with the increase we have seen just in the last few years, I really am starting to worry that studios are abandoning 'original' ideas. In any case, when I heard that Dawn was going to be remade, my first thought was that it really couldn't be any worse than the original. I know the original Dawn has a cult-like following, but in all honesty that film is not very good.So..........what about the 2004 version? Well, let me say this. The remake is good, when you compare it to the original. But, I do have several problems with this film. I'll get to those in a second. Let me address the positives.First of all, this film does not follow the original in every detail. Most remakes don't, but for Dawn this was actually the best choice. Dawn is all about one thing...........survival. We have a group of people that are simply trying to survive. I like the fact that the group becomes a family of sorts, realizing that they need one another to survive. I also liked how Ving Rhames was the only true bad-ass in the film. He is a cop, so it is to be expected. But Rhames (as he usually does) plays this part so well that you love it when he starts to accumulate a high body count of zombies. I liked the diversity of characters. A salesman, a nurse, a gay organ player for a church, a playboy, a jerk security guard...........as that diversity meshes really well in this film. I also liked how in the midst of all the chaos, the characters get to know one another, meaning we get to know who they are. A lot of time, films like Dawn look past this aspect. I'm glad the director didn't do that. And then their is the segment that had me rolling..........and for you Disturbed fans out their, you know what I am talking about. Using Disturbed's 'The Sickness', they had some guy singing the song in a Frank Sinatra style that just was so funny, I had to play the over again. It is pure genius to use this song in the film, but to do it in this way was just so damn funny.Now, the bad stuff. I guess their is a handbook out their entitled 'What to do when Zombies attack'. And in that book, the author must have stated that the first place to seek shelter is..........The Mall! And wouldn't you know, the zombies must have known this (or maybe the author turned into a zombie and told all his zombie buddies that survivors will flock to the mall) cause right before our group of survivors can get into the mall, the zombies show up. Okay, I can live with this. But I refuse to accept that mall security guards will be packing heat. In Dawn, the security guys are packing, which was a terrible thing to have in the film. Then, this movie wasted Mekhi Phiefer's talents. If you watch ER, then you know this guy is one hell of an actor. Here, he is wasted. Lastly, this film is not a horror movie. It is an action film with zombies. Their really isn't anything scary about this film. The zombies look great, meaning they look hideous and scary. But the film is not a horror film.Overall, Dawn is good for what it is, and it is actually a remake that is better than the original. Having Rhames as the lead character was a great call, cause anybody else in that role just wouldn't work. I think Ving is one of the most under-appreciated actors today. But I also have to mention Jake Weber, mostly because I hope this film will give him more exposure. The guy is a great talent, and he plays his part so well that you really feel for him in the end. Those two made this movie for me.",7,0,0,30 December 2004
Alien vs. Predator," What did you expect?
","Even after I had read the negative reviews about this film, I still went with a buddy of mine to check it out. He and I are big Predator fans (yes, even Predator 2 is a movie I like), and I also enjoy the Alien series (Aliens being my favorite). So, as a fan, I really wasn't bothered by the PG-13 rating, but I found it odd that FOX was willing to sacrifice product over profitability. But, with AVP, FOX has managed to put out three box office successes (the other two being I, Robot and The Day After Tomorrow). So, I guess the gamble has paid off.(SPOILERS AHEAD)!!!!!!!!!!!Okay, so now to the movie. Well, you all know the plot, so i will skip that much a hit some other things. First is the cast. Besides our lead heroine, we get to know them very little. In a way this is good because we all paid to see the Aliens battle the Predators. I'll hit the latter part in a second. As for the cast, you really do not care about them. Heck even when the two guys are talking about getting home to there kids, you know they are gonna die. So, the dialogue between the two seems rather pointless. Then, there is our lead heroine (Sanaa Lathan) and the pyramid expert Sebastian. Sebastian is a know-it-all and he is the one who figures out the backstory of the Predators and Aliens. The backstory is neat, but it really could have used more thought to it to make it seem more logical. In any case, the Predators come back to Earth every hundred years and hunt the Aliens, and the Humans are used as hosts to breed the Aliens. Which is why the satellites found the temple in the arctic. Yep, the Predators set it up because they needed our team of expert scientists and such as hosts for there hunt. Sound silly? Well, it is, but I was willing to look past all that. In any case, the cast is expendable and as a result.........they die.Now, on to the fight scenes. There is very little action between the Predators and Aliens, but what little we get looks very good. This alone saved the movie for me. My only beef here is that two of the Predators die very quickly once they get into the temple, leaving the one main Predator to do battle with all the Aliens. Lucky for him, our lead star is willing to team up with him to fight the beasts. Look, we wanted the Aliens fighting the Predators, and I feel that killing two Predators off like they did was just too damn silly. In any case, the effects and such are very good and should salvage some of the movie for you.As for the Aliens? I felt they looked good (what little we do see because they mostly come out in the dark), and they have no alterations to them (at least they didn't try to put that stupid Alien from Resurrection in the film). The Aliens we get are what we saw in Aliens. Now, the tail is used quite often, and it looks good too when it is used. As for the queen? Okay, she has been locked down by the Predators and is awakened by one of our cast members stepping on a floor piece. Yes, it does look like Frankenstein's monster when she awakens as the electric current flows through her body. Here is my problem with this. She finally figures out how to get loose, as she sacrifices her young and there acid breaks the chains! Okay, me thinks if she is this smart that she would have figured this out many, many years ago. But, for the sake of the film, she just now figures it out and she gets loose. Obviously, she has her big scene in the final battle with the Predator and our wonder woman. Was it just me, or did anyone else think of Jurassic Park when the Queen Alien is chasing the woman? I laughed my ass off at that. The Predators look good. I like how Anderson used there camouflage, especially when one Predator jumps from one side to the other during a battle with the humans in the temple. I liked the new throwing star (I guess that is what you would call it) the Predators had. There really wasn't anything cheesy about them.Overall, the film is what it is. I have read that Anderson was unhappy with it because he didn't get to make the film he wanted to. If that is the case, then I hope once the DVD is out that FOX will release his cut of the film (which was R-rated). I don't think the film is as horrible as some have called it. It is a 'popcorn flick' and to take it seriously is the wrong approach. If you like Sci-Fi and action, then this film will give you that.",Null,0,0,23 August 2004
Speed," Still kicks butt
","I remember seeing Speed the weekend it opened in the summer of 94'. My friend talked me into seeing the film (I just could not buy Keanu Reeves as an action hero), and so there I was in the theatre thinking that Speed would be an average film at best. From the moment the elevator dropped, I was hooked.  Speed is one of the best action films to have ever been made, and even if you see it or have seen it 10, 20, 50, or 100 times it still grabs you and takes you on the ride of your life.  Maybe there were a couple of things that were far fetched ideas (like the bus jumping the gap in the freeway), but overall this movie will thrill you and entertain you from start to finish.  8 out of 10.",Null,2,3,30 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best trilogy ever made.
","When I first learned that the LOTR trilogy was going to be made, I was very excited. I had waited a long time for it. But, then I heard that a guy named Peter Jackson was directing and I became worried. I thought that New Line made a mistake in hiring Jackson because he was only known for horror films and he had never had a hit film. Well, I was wrong. Peter Jackson has given us the best trilogy ever made. Yes, LOTR is better than Star Wars (episodes 4,5 &6).So, is ROTK better than Two Towers? No. Is it better than Fellowship? No. However, I am sure that many feel that ROTK is the best of all three and I really couldn't argue with that. But to me, Fellowship is the best, but Two Towers and ROTK are very a very close second and third.
ROTK has an epic battle scene that you must see to believe. It is so amazing that I will gurantee you that ROTK will win an oscar for special effects. The acting is once again solid, and Sean Astin does need to receive an Oscar nod for his performance in ROTK. I won't put anything in here to spoil it for anyone. Just go see this movie and enjoy the three plus hours.",9,0,0,18 December 2003
