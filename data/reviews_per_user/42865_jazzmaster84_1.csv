Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Comedy of the Year, by FAR!!!
","So, I just saw Borat: Cultural Learnings of America to Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, at a special Black Carpet screening in Philadelphia, and I am still laughing the next day.Sacha Boren Cohen is a brilliant satirist, and instead of making fun of a person, he allows the person to make fun of themselves. This is witnessed most strikingly at the soon to be famous 'rodeo' scene, which is as follows.ATTENTION: THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS Borat and his producer arrange for him to sing the national anthem at rodeo. While he is getting ready to go out in the arena, he gets tips from an old cowboy, who tells him to 'cut off his mustache so he can at least pass for eye-tali-an.' When Borat tries to kiss him 'as his custom', the guy says the only people who do that here are homos. Borat makes a comment that in his country they are rounded up and kept in jail, the rodeo guy says 'strung up? Well we're trying to do that here too!' All in all, this movie will be either loved, or hated, there is NO middle ground. Either people will laugh harder than they've ever laughed before, or be so outraged and disgusted that they will petition to have it removed from theaters.",10,7,31,21 September 2006
