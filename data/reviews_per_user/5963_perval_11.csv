Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace is a disappointing ,mediocre film with very few things to like about it
","The Phantom Menace is considered by many(and me)one of the worst Star Wars films.The movie was a huge disappointment at the time but it became a huge box office success.It suffers from a lot of problems like the over use of CGI,(unlike the Original Trilogy's breath taking practical effects)a plot that is based mostly on hilarious politics and the biggest problem of them all is the extremely annoying character of Jar Jar Binks that became the mot hated character among Star Wars fans.It also has a big subplot about a federation space station in the third act that is quite similar to A New Hope.I think that the film is not awful but mediocre and has some quality in it.I enjoyed Ewan McGregor's performance a lot. I also liked Liam Neeson in the movie.The only character that was kind of developed in the movie was Anakin(he wasn't three dimensional but he at least had a backstory that made him lovable)The villain was one dimensional but he was awesome.( I know that this is not a good film argument but it's still a fact)By far the best part of the movie was the last fight sequence which it was incredibly well choreographed and was incredibly fun and the John Williams score especially the Duel Of The Fates(which it was used in the last fight sequence I talked about).Overall the movie is mediocre to bad and if you are not a Star Wars fan you shouldn't spend your time watching this movie.",5,0,3,17 August 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino did it again with Inglorious Basterds. This film is fun,well acted,has great dialogue and compelling characters.
","Quentin Tarantino did it again.Inglorious basterds is one of the best recent war films and it is extremely fun,incredibly acted,and quite original(as most of Tarantino's work).The film's story as I said is original but it is also complex full of twists and interesting subplots.Inglorious basterds despite its name it barely develops the basterds' characters but develops mostly Shosana who is more relate able and her actions and emotions are justified from her tragic backstory.The film has a great cast with terrific performances by Brad Pitt,Melanie Laurent and Micheal Fassbender but the films best performance was by Christoph Waltz as the films main antagonist Col. Hans Landa who his character is very intelligent and has a 'personal connection' with one of our heroes(do not worry this is not a spoiler it shows it in the very first minutes of the film).The film also has great dialogue(a Tarantino trademark) which is important to the movie because there are long scenes with people sitting and talking,something that could be boring but because of the amazing dialogue and Tarantino's masterful directing those scenes are full of suspense.Some people complain that the film's ending is not historically accurate but this is not a problem because this film is not suppose to be historically accurate and it takes place in Tarantino's fantasy version of history.In a nutshell, this film is very fun,well acted,has a few great,lovable and complex characters,amazing dialogue and an intriguing story full of twists.You really have to see it(but you probably have seen a hundred times)",8,1,6,18 August 2017
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight is an incredible film with great dialogue,interesting characters and a story full of twists
","The Hateful Eight is an amazing film and one of the best films of 2015.The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's eighth film and it is a western-contained thriller- mystery film.The movie's plot is original,interesting and full of twists and revelations that will keep you in the edge of your seat.The film has Eight main characters that hate each other(as the title suggests).Almost all of those characters are developed and have a unique personality and chemistry between each other.The majority of the film takes place in a small motel and doesn't have any action sequences but it is definitely not boring because of Tarantino's incredible dialogue and masterful directing.Tarantino's directing was also old school and it makes you feel like you are watching a film made in the 60s but it still has the right amount of modern touches.The film had a lot of Tarantino's trades like the fun dialogue and some violence and gore.The Hateful Eight is not as rewatchable as other Tarantino's film like Pulp Fiction.It goes without saying that the performances were amazing especially the performances by Samuel L Jackson,Kurt Russel and Jenifer Jason Leigh.Forgot to mention that the music score by the legendary Ennio Moricone is great and even won an Oscar.In a nutshell The Hateful Eight has interesting and unique characters, amazing dialogue,very good performances and an intriguing story with twists and revelations.If you are a movie nerd like me you really have to see this movie(but you probably saw a million times).But if you are just a mainstream moviegoer that doesn't really enjoys great dialogue and characters but just wants to have some fun at the cinema or watch a movie at home and spend his time,you probably won't enjoy it(no offence,I am saying this because I saw this movie a few times with people that aren't really into films and they didn't enjoyed it a lot)",8,2,4,19 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Maybe it is not as good as it's predecessors but it's still a great film that gives a satisfying ending to the trilogy
","Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi is the third movie in the original trilogy.The film was not as good as it's predecessor but it's still an amazing film that gave a satisfying conclusion to one of the best trilogies of cinema's history.The characters in the film are damaged by the events of the previous film and are changed by them.So the characters are developed and emotionally complex. The protagonists that we know and love are also dealing with new problems and the antagonist is more lovable and three dimensional than before.The tone is lighter than the previous film,the plot has some problems (there is a big subplot about the second Death Star that is similar to the first Star Wars film) and it doesn't take risks so it feels less mature but it is still very enjoyable.It goes without saying that the practical effects are mind blowing and the music score by John Williams is iconic.The performances are good especially by Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones(fun fact: besides doing the voice for Darth Vader in all of the three films he was only credited in Return of the Jedi)In a nutshell,Return of the Jedi is a great film(rated #75 best film of all time by IMDb) with great characters,amazing visuals,incredible music and unforgivable moments that gives a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy despite being the worst in it(I don't say that it is a bad film I just say that it is not as good as the other two films in the trilogy).If you haven't seen it you really should but I am sure that you saw it a billion times.",8,1,2,24 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack Of The Clones is a disappointing movie full of bad moments and a boring,cliché love story with no interesting characters and very few things to like
","Star Wars:Episode II Attack of the Clones is the second installment in the Prequel Trilogy and by many(included me) considered the worst in the franchise.This film suffers from a lot of problems like bad dialogue(i.e.I don't like sand),the lack of character development in almost all of the main characters and a cliché,boring love story with no chemistry between the main characters.The film also suffers from the overuse of CGI that looks dated and has some shots that were considered bad at the time( I don't say that the visuals are bad in this movie but that they overuse CGI that is not as good as the originals practical effects).Attack of the Clones also had some bad acting from Hayden Christensen(I don't think that he is a bad actor but the lines he had to say were bad).The movie wasn't completely awful and had some thing to enjoy like the extremely fun performance by Ewan McGregor and the great performance by Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. The music score by John Williams is very good and the action sequences(lightsaber duels) are well choreographed and are very fast paced and incredibly fun.I also enjoyed Obi Wan's character who wasn't developed but had a fun personality and was lovable because of McGregor's performance.The only character in the film who was kind of developed was Anakin who had suffered from some tragic events through the movie that changed him(that doesn't make him three dimensional and complex but it is still something).In a nutshell the movie is mediocre to bad ,sometimes boring and doesn't invest you into the story but has some things to enjoy.",5,0,1,18 August 2017
Django Unchained," Django Unchained is a film that will stand in the hall of fame with history's greatest westerns
","Django Unchainted is probably one of the greatest modern westerns and one of the best films of 2012.The film has a lot of things to enjoy.It has an interesting,original plot that will make you feel like it is a spaghetti western made in the 60s but also has the right amount of modern touches like having some humour(besides that the film is mostly a drama) and that it shows the racism that existed at the time and how white people treated black people at the time.The film has great action sequences(especially some shootouts that were amazing) and has some gore and violence.It has incredible dialogue and amazing performances by Samuel L Jackson,Jamie Foxx,Leonardo Di Caprio and Christoph Waltz.The characters in the film were interesting and developed.Django's character was the most developed in the film.His actions and emotions were justified by his tragic past and he was lovable and the film made you care for him.The antagonist Calvin Candie played by Leonardo Di Caprio was interesting,intelligent and menacing and Christoph Waltz's character Dr Shultz was also very intelligent,likable and entertaining. It goes without saying that Quentin Tarantino's directing in the film was masterful.If you haven't see this you really should but I am sure that you already have seen it a thousand times.",8,3,6,21 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi is shocking, entertaining with complicated characters and emotionall depth. Simply amazing.
","The Last Jedi is simply amazing. It is universally aclaimed by critics and concidered by many one of the best films of the year and the best in the franchise since The Empire Strikes Back. Unfortunately, there is a group of fans that are outraged by the film because it is original and dares to take the series to new places so they say it doesn't feel like Star Wars so the imdb rating for the film is criminally low(7.6 at the time I wright the review) Offcourse, I respect other opinions and thoughts about the film. 
 Story:
The Last Jedi is original and shocking while it honours the rich legacy of the Saga. It has twists and revelation that will keep you in the edge of your seat. Despite it's runtime it never feels over-long or boring and it's totally necesarry for the characters to be fully developed. The tone is very dark and gives you a feeling of despair. Overral, the film is unpredictable,dark and has some wisecrack humor (that may feel a bit forced but it never fells flat and doesn't affect the dark tone) and is filled with great characters.
 The characters:
As I said the characters really stood out . I won't get to any spoilers but the film did a very good job with making it's characters complex and developed. Rey may be concidered by some Mary Sue but in The Last Jedi she is more human and flawed. Kylo Ren really steals the show by being one of the most emotionally complex and lovable villains in recent history and his character arc was impresssive and it showed the conflict of his character. Luke on the other hand is way more dark and sarcastic than the original trilogy. Some people didn't like that because it ruins their childhood hero but for most critics and for me that change in character was very well explained and it showed a more realistic side of his character. The supporting characters were also very good. Poe, Finn and the new addition Rose had personalities and a lot of chatacter building moments. 
 Rian Johnson:
The writer-director of the film is one of the greatest new filmakers that directed indie and smaller films like the Brick and Looper and he also made some of the best Breaking Bad episodes. His script was simply phenomenal and his direction took the film and the whole series to new level. He made one of the biggest blockbusters of the year into an amazing film with artistic feel and quality something that most recent big budget films don't have because they focus to much on action, stars and bad cgi. I would dare and call it the biggest arthouse movie. (I don't say that modern big budget films aren't artistic. i.e. Blade Runner 2049 , Logan, Wonder Woman, War for the Planet of the Apes.) 
 Star Wars:
As I've mentioned the film takes the series to new places but also honours it's legacy. All those things above made me as a film geek love this movie but the lore, the references and the whole asthetic made my inner Star Wars fun love this film even more.
 Flaws:
I don't want to sound like a fanboy and I recognise the flaws of the movie. There is a whole sequence in the 2nd act in Canto Bight that felt a bit forced and it wasn't as good as the rest of the film. The first few minutes were also not that great. The humor felt a bit out of place and annoying some times and I wished that it wasn't there but it was funny.
 
The Last Jedi deserves your attention. It is mind-blowing. I don't want to insult people that didn't like it and I respect their opinion but for many and myself this was an amazjng experience. Where do I rank The Last JediMy Star Wars Films ranking.
1)Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
2)Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017) ( I think that it is as
good as the Empire but because The Empire Strikes Back is concidered a classic and I saw it way more times I put it on number 1)

The Imitation Game," The Imitation Game is a great film with complicated and lovable characters,beautiful performances and an emotional ending.
","The Imitation Game is a beautiful film that it is probably one of the best recent world war II films and it is not even a war film(at least not a 'traditional'war film with guns and soldiers) .The films protagonist Alan Turing was by far the best part of the film.His character was developed,complicated,lovable and also relate able.I also enjoyed Joan Clarke's character(Keira Knightley) who she wasn't as developed as Turing's character but she still was lovable.The performances were also very good especially the performance by Benedict Cumberbatch was incredible.It had a character driven plot with some twists and it delivered a very emotional ending.If you haven't already seen this you really should(but I assume that you already have seen it more than once)",8,2,4,19 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge Of The Sith is an incredible movie in a bad trilogy with intriguing story and great characters but still has a few problems
","Star Wars Episode III Revenge Of The Sith is a great ending in a bad trilogy.Revenge Of The Sith is by far the best movie in the Star Wars Prequel trilogy(and also the only good one in the trilogy).This film is the darkest Star Wars film since the The Empire Strikes Back(until 2005 at least).The film besides its dark atmosphere is very fun with amazing action sequences and well choreographed fast paced lightsaber duels.Episode III uses CGI as its predecessors but the quality of it has improved.It goes with out saying that the John Williams score was incredible as wellRevenge Of The Sith has fun action sequences and good visuals but what makes it so special is the intriguing plot full of twists and the great characters and character development through the movie.Especially Anakin's character who through the movie you can see him being torn apart and becoming something monstrous only because he wants to protect his loved ones(don't worry this is not a spoiler it was shown in the trailer)The film had also amazing performances by Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid and I also thought that Natalie Portman's performance was good too.The film also gives an emotional and satisfying ending to the trilogy and also sets up the original trilogy.Episode III wasn't perfect and had some problems.The biggest one was the bad dialogue.The film also suffered from some bad acting mostly by Hayden Christensen(I don't want to insult him and I don't think he is a terrible actor but the lines he had to say were terrible)In a nutshell,Revenge of the Sith is the best in the Prequel Trilogy and it has a interesting plot and great characters that makes you invested in the overall story but has a few problems mostly bad dialogue.If you haven't seen it before,you really should.It's not a perfect film but still it is worth seeing.(but you probably have seen it a thousand times)",7,0,0,18 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope is a near perfect film with jaw-dropping visuals,iconic music and great characters
","Star Wars Episode IV A New A Hope is a near perfect film that changed cinema's history from the effects,to the sequel expectations,to a big fan base and much more.Star Wars as I mentioned is a near perfect film because of the breath taking effects, one of the most iconic movie themes by John Williams.But mostly the movie is near perfect because of the characters that are lovable,with great personality and are developed through the movie.The film is also great because its story is interesting and considered original at the time and also has some legendary performances by Harrisson Ford,Sir Alec Guinnes and a great(and uncredited)voice performance by James Earl Jones.A big quality point of the film is that it is incredibly fun and rewatchable because of its memorable dialogue and amazing action sequences. In a nutshell Star Wars is a near perfect film that changed the cinema and inspired generations of filmmakers with its three dimensional,lovable characters,awe- inspiring practical effects,an interesting story,great music and memorable dialogue",9,0,0,18 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire Strikes Back is a flawless,character driven masterpiece with dark,complex plot full of twists and some of the best visuals and music scores of all times
","This movie is a flawless masterpiece.The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best of the Original Trilogy but one of the best sequels ever made(with The Godfather Part II and The Dark Knight).The Empire is darker than its predecessor,it develops our beloved characters from A New Hope and makes them more relate-able and complex.It also introduces new characters that became fan favorites.This movie has a complex,dark plot with depth and shocking twists.The film is full of incredible dialogue with memorable and quotable lines.It goes without saying that the visuals are mind blowing and the music score by John Williams is iconic.In a nutshell Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes back is a dark, mature sequel that exceeded the original and it is considered one of the best films of all time that you totally have to see(but you probably saw a million times)",10,1,2,17 August 2017
