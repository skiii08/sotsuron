The Hangover," Funniest movie ever made.
","This is the single funniest movie for people with my kind of humor ever made. My kind of humor is movies like Old School, Anchorman, Knocked up, and Superbad. And as much as I love all of those movies, in pure hilarity this one blows them out of the water. Even if you didn't care for those movies very much I would still expect everyone who sees it to laugh until it hurts. I want to watch it a second time so I can hear all the jokes I was too busy laughing through the first time to catch. Unless you are easily offended or have a heart condition where a huge amount of laughter can be a bad thins this is a must see. Best comedy ever made bar none.",10,4,8,6 July 2009
