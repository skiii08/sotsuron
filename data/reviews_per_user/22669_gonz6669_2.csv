The Ring," Terrific
","**Spoilers**After reading other people's comments on The Ring, I thought I would post mine.  Being a fan of the original Japanese version, I went into this with a sceptical mind.  Turns out that I liked the original better.  The story was very close to the original and was very well represented on the screen. After watching the original again, I was disappointed to find that I didn't like it nearly as much.  The acting in the original seemed almost bland and timid compared to the remake and there were a few plot holes that I never noticed before.  Maybe I liked the remake better because I didn't have to read the movie, I don't know, but both are definitely worth watching.  If you haven't seen either one yet, watch them both and decide for yourself. I loved it personally.  10 Stars.Did she show you the horses?",10,1,1,28 February 2003
Donnie Darko," Strikingly original
",I've never seen a movie quite like this one.  I rented it when I worked at the video store and ended up watching it four times in a row that night. I couldn't stop watching it.  I can't think of a single movie recently that has had the same effect on me.  I was completely blown away.  10 Stars,10,0,1,28 February 2003
