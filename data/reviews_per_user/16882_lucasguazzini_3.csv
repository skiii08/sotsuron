Ford v Ferrari," TIme goes by
","Both Bale and Damon are getting old..so am I.
A story I didn't know, told from the perspective of the loser.
David against Goliah, where David are both Ferrari, Miles and Shelby, facing in different ways the Ford 'enemy'.
Miles can't quit his passions and fulfills his faith, a star that after fighting his demons and winning finds his peace no matter he has been mocked and used.
He shines in the end before crashing hard.",8,2,2,17 January 2020
Argo," Nice script, nice direction
","Eventually i realized i had already seen this movie..Have you seen Munich by Spielberg??? It really reminded me that movie. OK, obviously the plot is different, but I think Affleck took inspiration from that movie. The colors, that way he defines characters. I had that feeling growing during all the movie. I don't get the integration between the spy plot and Mendez's family matters.. If you're an hero then you're capable of providing for your family? OK, it helps to empathize with the character, but there's no added value, in my modest opinion. I don't dislike Afflech as an actor, but i prefer him as a director.Go see Argo because it's definitely worth it, but don't overrate it at all.",8,1,2,27 November 2012
Me Before You," Sad story, faced similarly to 'Intouchables (2011)'
","What would you do if your life wouldn't be the same? If you shall be totally depending on another person? This is the tragedy that the protagonist has to face when his life is devastated by an accident. Movie with good rhythm, deeply sad. I couldn't hold back the tears... I didn't read the trailer, and for the first 30 minutes you don't really have a clue of where the story if going eventually. Incredible expressiveness for Emilia Clarke. She can really make the difference with her touch, even if her character is a bit too emphasized and her story isn't thorough in the end. Eventually we all should be glad of what we have in our life.",8,3,4,5 October 2016
