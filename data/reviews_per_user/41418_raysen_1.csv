Hereditary," overrated, overhyped and mediocre
","Really, how can people give this a 10 or a 9 even? I mean 60 min. into the movie nothing happens, its more a family drama without any worth mentioning horror.just the last third starts to heat up and catch the viewers attention by explaining why and what is going on...and even then, its not even scary or terrifying or psychologically exuberant.
they do explain why things happen the way they do, but its almost at the end, and by then most of you may fell asleep.
this movie is interesting at best, but not a horror shocker.
I caught myself checking twitter and instagram alot of times during the movie, which is a bad sign. not to mention the ending was a big big disapointment.conclusion: waste of time, its too long, and the interesting stuff happens basically during the last 30 min.",6,1,4,7 July 2018
