Black Swan," Black Swan Review
","I'm very glad that i enjoyed this film! One because i had to purchase it on Blu-ray and two, many of my friends suggested it to me. Ill admit, i wasn't all for the ballerina aspect, but i was all over the dark/sinister aspect. i felt scared, tormented, etc. i enjoyed how dark the film got despite the fact that i only jumped once. what i loved about the film is there is no explanation, its all up to the viewer. and to this point, i still don't know what to make of everything that happened. but all in all, still a great film! if you're someone like me who loves a dark atmosphere, you will be pleased and yes it cancels out the ballet concept.",9,1,2,19 August 2011
Resident Evil: Extinction," 'Sticking to the games' idea... has gone extinct.
","now i know that the title of this comment and the rating i gave this film doesn't really go together. as a film based on the popular games (which I'm a fan of) it HARDLY sticks to the games. thats where the title of this comment comes in, but as for the movie itself, looking at it as a stand alone film (looking passed its based on a game) it is a good movie, which is where the 8/10 comes in. despite it being a very good film, it seems as if the creators (of the films) wanted to make a third film so bad, that they didn't want to wait for another RE game (despite RE4) so they just made up their own story (sticking to umbrella and t-virus). T-virus whipes out entire world, convoy traveling across Nevada desert, etc.good-lots of action. crows are finally used. different take on zombies (fast 'crimson heads' zombies) bad-literally not based on any of the games, no Nevada desert in any of the games. Ali larter was good, but she isn't a Claire redfield. actor who played Wesker-good, but his character of just sitting behind a desk-bad. i wanted to see him in action.Summary: if you are a true RE gamer and are WANTING/EXPECTING this film to cover one of the games, don't expect too much. if you are a fan but is willing to accept they (only) kept the main principles (t-virus, umbrella, zombies) then you will enjoy. in my personal opinion, i think they could have covered RE: Code Veronica instead of, t-virus whipes out entire world plot.",9,0,1,23 December 2008
Burn After Reading," Keep After Watching
","a movie filled with good drama, great twists and an unexpected death. Burn After Reading will make you Keep After Watching.good-a good story. a very good serious adult like comedy. amazing twists-certain characters death, the discovery of who is following George, etc.bad-first of all, i know that every film (must) introduce the characters before getting to the point of the film. but in this film, it seems like it takes forever to get to the point (the CD) and all the time up until that point seems kinda boring but at the same time entertaining.summary-a good film if you enjoy twists and are willing to accept its adult like comedic.",9,1,3,1 January 2009
Resident Evil," From game to movie.
","out of all three resident evil films, this is the only one that i gave a perfect 10. it may not contain any of the characters from the game(s), but it contains all the principles. the mansion, the underground lab, and a beautifully executed boss battle.the good-keeps the atmosphere of the game with a slightly different story. the bad-followed by two sequels that have a habit of changing a few things just so they can work (for the film makers)summmary-if you love RE, you will enjoy this. the story is convincing, the way the zombies are released is buyable! its a great flick for a zombie/RE fan.",9,2,3,24 December 2008
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," resident evil 2 covers RE3
","despite its follower (extinction) this film actually covers majority of the video game (RE3:N) it takes place in glorious raccoon city. the nemesis has joined the party, but you can clearly tell that the film makers threw in their own ingredients for the story. the nemesis was only created to see how 'strong' Alice is. the nemesis only sticks to his true nature (from the game) when he is first introduced as he is blowing away the STARS members, then he is just an obstacle that Alice must over come. i wasn't very fond of the 'boss' battle, who is stronger, Alice or Nemesis.good-stuck to the game, included Jill valentine and nemesis. nemesis looked great but purpose was altered bad-the zombie attacks seemed unorganized. it was like the film makers said, lets throw in a bunch here, there. don't get me wrong, yea its 'zombie flick' but extinction felt more like a video game (crows first, super zombies second, then boss battle) in apocalypse, the zombies seemed as if no one cared when they arrived. nemesis boss battle (alive vs nemesis) was dumb-who is stronger? i wanted an actual creature to mutate (like the licker or Dr. Isaacs from the other films) summary-its enjoyable, its there, i enjoyed extinction better (despite it didn't stick to any of the games)",9,1,3,24 December 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The Fallen Has Risen
","just got back from finally seeing this film! i loved the first one to the point of not even letting anyone borrow the precious DVD. i was psyched about this film...and i still am. the movie definitely forces you to say 'i wish id seen the first one' if you for some reason never seen the first one. and i say that because it opens (after the title sequence) pretty much saying 'welcome back' and throws you right into the bot battles. there is no 'refreshery' of the first film's events. the story was a little there but i wasn't there for that, i was mainly there for the action.PROS-starts of good right away. never a dull moment. action is great and better than first. formation of devastator is pretty wild and so was he! we see more of the decepticons (as in screen time). the forest battle: optimus vs. starscream megatron and grindor CONS-Galloway. not much transformation is seen. megatron and starscream do not battle as i hoped (just a few words). scorponok just 'shows up'. this is not on DVD yet.",9,1,6,28 June 2009
Halloween," ...and along came zombie!
","i watched this fully for the first time tonight in my 23 year life. but I've watched the zombie remake many times. the original was coming on, i recorded it with the dvr and watched it a few days later.... its nice to know that zombie's remake was sitting on my DVD shelf. i didn't have to wait 20 or 30 years for someone to come along and make it more interesting... it was already here! thats the good thing about watching the originals for the first time 30 years later, the remake has already been done. ill admit, the now popular music score for Halloween is what kept me watching the film. however the lack of murders and awesomeness... not really for me. its hard to believe that some people 'decided' to find this film scary. not saying that zombie's version is scary, just saying that its better.",6,0,4,20 June 2009
Iron Man," don't hate but don't love...
","i just saw this movie for the first time tonight and the reason it took me so long was because iron man isn't really a big well known hero to me. however tonight, i thought id give it a shot and i was hoping it would be serious, down to earth, not cheesy like the kilmer/clooney batman films....well it wasn't as cheesy as them, but it was campy fun like the spiderman films. of course, i couldn't tell you the first thing about iron man, as in his origin, so i wouldn't know if the atmosphere is supposed to be dark or not, but i was expecting a much more mature, dark, serious tone... me seeing the sequel will probably take as long as it did for me to see this film...",7,1,2,23 January 2010
