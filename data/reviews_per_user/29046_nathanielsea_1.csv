The Finest Hours," Great movie
","Loved the classic 1950's setting, and the way the movie portrays the coast guard. I would say it is a spiritual movie because many people were praying that they would survive. I love how the movie accurately portrays the early days of coast guard rescue, and the rescue of an oil tanker.This is a true story, which I truly appreciate.Got to know the characters, their heartbreak(s), failure(s), triumph(s), humbleness, faith and belief in each other.Loved the movie in its entirety.",9,1,2,15 October 2016
