The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Bland
","This film is so awful I felt compelled to write my first review on IMDb. How this film has attained an 8.2 rating is beyond me. The writing is clich√©d to the extreme, the acting wooden and unbelievable.I'm sure the film isn't aimed at my demographic (male 40's) and more likely at teenage girls, but there are many coming of age films that do it so much better. Think of American Graffiti (7.5), Breakfast Club (7.9), Submarine (7.3), Fish Tank (7.3), Juno (7.7), La Haine (8.1) etc. How can this piece of garbage be better than any of these and a hundred more?If you want to watch a great coming of age film then give this a wide berth and watch a real movie.",1,38,90,26 February 2013
