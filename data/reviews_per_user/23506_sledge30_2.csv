Raiders of the Lost Ark," Becoming a lost classic
","This is the film that finally defined Spielberg as a great director. If anybody who hasnt seen this film in a while go check it out. You will soon forget such modern so called great films like Forrest Gump, Memento, Titanic, etc.....Watch it and see what a fantastic story George Lucas crafted, mixing fact with fiction and turning a action hero into what nobody has done before or since...believable. Everything about this movie is dead on. From the acting, special effects, cinematography, and the score is an all out ride by its self. If you want to see Spielberg, Lucas, Ford, and Williams at the top of their game this is for you.",10,0,0,22 August 2002
Forrest Gump," This will break hearts
","First off let me be fair about the movie...nice special effects. Now with that said sit back and let me rip the hell out of this horrible movie. I personally think Paramount and Robert Zemekis were handing out their own batch of Jim Jones Kool Aid at every theater in America when this was out.From start to finish I dont think I have ever seen a movie (I say movie, because this is not a film) that is more predictable, melo-dramatic, or sterotypicable. How in the world this dreck won best picture is beyond me. I personally believe the Academy was doing Speilberg a favor and awarded his buddy Zemekis for making an overblown bad film. Lets face it if this movie only grossed 60 million it would have been cosidered a failure and would have won best special effects and thats IT!!! In my opinion this is Ishtar part 2, without Isabelle Adjani. This movie was a forshadow of things to come from Zemekis. Contact, Cast Away, What lies Beneath; although better films than Forrest Gump just proves Zemekis has sold his soul to the BIG HOLLYWOOD garbage machine. Come back Bob, you were once a promising director.",1,45,105,11 August 2002
