The Hangover," Adult fun
","A refreshing change in the story line and a slick cast of characters makes The Hangover a must-see movie. The adult fun bordering on the likes of Borat makes the movie kind of more a guy movie than a chic movie. Not that chicks can't dig it, but it does have some over the top scenes which may cause severe embarrassment for some. The dialogs were quite catchy, the acting I thought was quite quite well, and Galifianakis, someone I never knew before this movie came into being, is certainly a treat to watch. I would rate it to be less funny than Superbad but somewhat in par with Wedding Crashers. Whatever the case a movie you will want to see again. 8/10",8,3,6,15 July 2009
Public Enemies," Bit of a disappointment
","Considering the tremendous star power of the cast and the fire power of the story I was expecting a much more gripping film. In the end it just petered down to another ordinary flick. Nothing to take away from the stars themselves mind you, Depp was suave, Bale was his usual seriousness and Cotillard I thought was fantastic. However, on the whole the movie fizzles out. Rat-a-tat of guns and the a bank robbery here and a chase there. Nothing stands out. There was a lot of potential in the movie but somehow it was lost in the presentation aspect. Minimal dialog and lack of character development add to the woes. Marion Cotillard is the saving grace of the film.",6,3,11,1 July 2009
500 Days of Summer," Refreshing change
","Same old story, retold countless times, filmed even more. And yet Mark Webb makes it all the more original. Creative and funny, sad yet truthful 500 Days Of Summer hits all the sweet and sour aspects of romance and the fall out on its head without being over indulgent. Chemistry between all the actors worked out perfectly, and the architectural views of downtown LA showed how carefully the entire movie was thought out. The movies brings the best out of both Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel with the latter performing increasingly well with every new movie she picks up. Kudos to Webb and the entire cast and crew members for one great romance! 8/10.",8,0,2,24 August 2009
Yes Man," Delightful little comedy
","After much deliberation on whether to watch another Carrey flick or not, I finally decided that I should say yes! And you know what? It doesn't disappoint! Carrey is quite funny without performing any insane tricks and Deschanel complements this by keeping her character just right without overdoing it. There were a couple of things which I thought were taken to the extreme those being the scenes with the old lady and probably Hyde's role in the entire film. They could have probably edited these and made it less crude to keep it an overall movie for the family. Nonetheless the movie stands up on it's own and is more realistic and funny with a pleasant cast. 7/10.",7,1,1,27 July 2009
The Beach," Keeps you glued
","Danny Boyle is quite a director, no matter what you say. Here I am almost ten years since The Beach was released, and the movie still looked like it was released this week. From what I know Boyle makes most of his films based upon novels, and I make it a point to not read the novel to enjoy the film. The Beach doesn't disappoint and while some characters could have been more roles -- Ledoyen was practically paraded through the entire movie -- the premise and the beautiful locales make it a film worth watching. However I was confused by the ending -- not as much as how it ended but in the manner it ended. Altogether abrupt but worth the watch. 6/10.",6,0,1,1 September 2009
The Orphanage," Compelling storyline, slick direction
",I would have a hard time classifying El Orfanto as a horror film or a fantasy film since it brings in the best of both the worlds. The story moves along gently and lets the pieces of a puzzle fall into place with time. The direction and the screenplay was flawless and suit the pace of the movie. The entire mystery is portrayed through the eyes of Rueda and she does the job superbly as a protagonist. For a film involving spirits and ghosts I was expecting a lot of off the wall scenes. At the end I felt none of the scenes were induced and every scene was required to solve the pieces. This is a mark of a genius for a debut film maker like Bayona. 8/10.,8,1,2,20 August 2009
District 9," Watch it on the biggest theater you can find
","This is a movie that deserves to be watched on the big screen, the bigger the screen and the louder the sound the better your experience! Very realistic and a much more plausible story than most other science fiction films that I have seen. From frame one onwards you are transported to a 2010 South Africa where aliens and humans co-exist, and trust me, you will believe every bit of action that is taking place in it as much as you will believe that MNU exists! The perfect cast in such a film is where you know none of the cast. And it worked out perfectly - I can't attest to a much more realistic science fiction than this one! Similar to how Dark Knight was for 2008, District 9 is for 2009. Hopefully they will release it in an IMAX version. Don't miss it! 9/10.",9,4,8,16 August 2009
The Hurt Locker," Bullets, brains and bodies
","One of the absolute must-see movies of 2009, The Hurt Locker uncovers the harsh realities of the bomb defusing unit of the Delta Company seizing you from the get go. The backdrop of the bombs and the war, the uncharacteristic styles of the leader and his unit, the feeling of being in an alien country, the personal lives of the unit all of them are juxtaposed perfectly to reflect what it takes to be actually on the ground in a war zone. The documentary style shooting adds impetus and makes it all the more realistic. Wouldn't be surprising if the movie receives multiple nominations. Bigelow and Renner, the casting, everything looked brilliant. Special appearances from a few well known actors was a great touch! From Near Dark to Hurt Locker, Bigelow is now a director of her own. Not for the faint of heart. 8/10.",8,0,3,4 August 2009
