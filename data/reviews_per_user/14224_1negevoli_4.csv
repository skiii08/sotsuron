Deja Vu," Bruce Greenwood, as always, is great and so sexy and there's a cat who survives
","Completely unbelievable. Total B.S. Unintelligent. What a crock!I gave this piece of garbage one star because I love Bruce Greenwood and the cat manages to survive the transition of the movie (presumably). At least Ginger isn't introduced as a plot element and then never seen again, as in most half-arsed movies being produced nowadays. You see an animal and then never see it again or it is never even referred to again. When that happens, I don't watch anymore. So, they should get a point for that at least. And Bruce Greenwood. (Check out 'Nowhere Man' on DVD.)If this is supposed to be science fiction, it shouldn't take place in the present. Science can't even yet perfect face recognition or artificial intelligence. Or find bin Ladin.The premise is laughable and I can't even begin to imagine how much money it took to make this ridiculous Denzel vehicle.Why Bruce Greenwood isn't the master star of Hollywood, I'll never know.",1,13,19,19 August 2010
Knocked Up," Lame and Badly Cast and Badly Written and Directed
","My low rating of one star (there is no opportunity to give it a lower score, unfortunately) is not because of the language, nudity, etc. I am no prude and am frequently profane and nude myself. My only deal-breaker on anything is vomit. And it keeps showing up more and more. In fact, that car scene in 'The 40-Year Old Virgin' where the chick upchucks is the only thing I didn't like about '40 Year Old Virgin,' which I consider to be a work of genius. But if 'Knocked Up' is any indication of what to expect from Apetow in the future, 'Virgin' will stand alone among his work. Maybe all he had in him is the one genius fluke of 'Virgin' -- the film-director equivalent of a one-hit wonder.I was drawn to this film by 'Virgin,' and the uniformly great reviews in the press and on TV of 'Knocked Up.' Never will I believe a review or movie hype again. (Read the IMDb reviews -- overwhelmingly negative.) Maybe I'll just watch Wes Anderson movies from now on. He reaches for the stars every time.The casting of 'Knocked Up' is the worst of my complaints, although the premise, writing and directing all compete for first place. I liked Seth Rogan in 'Virgin' and I think Heigl is a beauty among beauties. But obviously that 'don't' mean the woman can act. I have never watched 'Gray's Anatomy,' so I was not familiar with her acting chops. Well, if this is an example of her best work, she is pitifully bad at what she does. I saw her bragging on herself on a TV interview about her delivery-room screaming. Even that was lame. If she had ditched the make up and appeared agonized and bathed in sweat, like in real life, it might have been a funny scene. Rogan and Heigl had no chemistry whatsoever. And, on top of that, we're supposed to believe that Heigl can't do any better than him and actually evolves into loving him. Now that's funny. There was zero realism in any aspect of this movie, which certainly is NOT a comedy since there was nothing even remotely funny about it. Oh, except for Ryan Secrest, who did the best acting in the movie, and I don't even like Secrest.Everything about this movie was phony, lame and embarrassingly bad. And it is filled with ugly actors who can't act, just what red-blooded women need to see.",1,21,41,30 September 2007
Closer," Insight into the mindset of a dirty old man
","So Mike Nichols has morphed into a dirty old man making inane dirty movies. What a disappointment. I knew nothing about this flick going in except that I mostly like Julia Roberts and Clive Owens. But really! I have heard the C word used in real life once, and I have been around the block a few times. Am I really supposed to believe that upper-middle-class people in modern-day London use it in every other sentence? (Or so it seemed. Gratuitous and shocking to me, and I am no prude.) Who do the writers and Nichols (and presumably Nichols' wife Diane Sawyer) hang around with? Oh, that's right, pretentious artsy fartsy types who may or may not be gay. Give me a break. No more Mike Nichols flicks for me. I am up to here with dirty old men, e.g., Nichols and Hugh Hefner. Ewww!",1,1,5,5 February 2008
Mulholland Drive," Visually beautiful and well-acted film with a couple of minor flaws
","Well, I saw this movie three nights ago and it is still 'with' me, so that says a lot. I think it is a beautiful, fascinating and evocative film, and good films about Hollywood and the movie biz are few and far between. I love good movies set in Hollywood -- my personal all-time favorite is 'Into the Night' with Michelle Pfeiffer (when she was very young and really beautiful and not so affected) and Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager. As for David Lynch, I loved Twin Peaks and am still ticked off that it was canceled, all these years later. I didn't like Blue Velvet so much, though. So I guess that makes me objective.After reading the lengthy plot summary here on IMDb immediately after seeing the film, I immediately got a handle on the movie's intricate structure and therefore did not have to wrangle with it until I came to a similar conclusion. Actually, my only complaint with Lynch is the blue box and key and the really tiny little people. Totally ludicrous and unnecessary. If there had been NO blue box, no blue key, and no really tiny little people, I think the movie would have been better. Much better. And no damage would have been done whatsoever. These particular elements added nothing but a touch of the ridiculous to what otherwise would have been a much better piece of work. We, the audience, would have caught on that the blonde lady was nutsy coo-coo without those ridiculous elements. Somebody needs to reign Lynch in a bit, for his own good.",7,1,3,23 August 2006
