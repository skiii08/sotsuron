Come and See," humanist manifesto
","I've seen the movie many years ago. Now that I've read one of the comments the last scene became a vivid memory. It is an ultimate humanist manifesto. You cannot shoot an innocent soul. Not even though you've suffered so much by the monstrosities it has produced as a grown up man. In some way it's defeatist. It says that the victims will remain victimized and the perpetrators will keep perpetrating. But how can we preserve our humanism if in the name of stopping a monster we become the monster itself? Otherwise, there is horror. Some of it might appear over the top at certain moments. It's the style present in many Russian movies about the Second Word War. Nevertheless, if one was strong enough to represent such enormous human suffering who are we to judge its stylisation?",Null,3,5,25 June 2005
I'm Not There," doing movie while induced
","The movie failed to impress me. It wasn't about Bob Dylan, but about a filmmaker needing to satisfy his ego by satirically playing off some obscure bits of gossip about the musician. What was missing the most from the equivalent of a yellow paper editorial was the music and the feel that made this guy famous and rich if you want it. The actors were unconvincing, playing too much cockiness and arrogance rather then the self confidence that all talent exurbs. It was hard to tell who and what do they represent. I was lost in these stories that didn't connect and weren't compelling at all. The use of costume show/period drama element was confusing as well. What connection does this have to Bob Dylan? Or was it just cut in for visual enhancement? I hope that there is one purpose that this movie serves which is a mystery know if only to the filmmaker. As per Bob Dylan, I feel like he has hit a low point by authorizing this piece of psychedelic trash.",Null,0,2,16 April 2008
