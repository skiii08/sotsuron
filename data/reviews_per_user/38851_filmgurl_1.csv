The Blair Witch Project," Original, Clever, Never Seen Anything Like It.
","I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' at a preview screening in Chicago back in April.  Directors Ed Sanchez and Dan Myrick truly succeed in creating one of the most original films of this century.  The horror is frightening.  The emotion, unmistakably real.  The way Sanchez and Myrick blur the lines between fact and fantasy is what will turn this film into a cult classic. My advice to anyone planning to see it:  Don't read too much about it. There are a lot of spoilers out there, but the less you know about it, the more you'll enjoy it.",Null,1,1,7 July 1999
