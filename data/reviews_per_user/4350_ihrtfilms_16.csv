The King's Speech," Fascinating and interesting story
","Colin Firth stars as The Duke Of York, later King George VI, who suffers from a terrible stammer and after numerous attempts to cure it, his wife played by Helena Bonham Carter finds an Australian man, Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush. Logue is a cheeky, but likable chap who is quite unperturbed by the notion of royalty and it seems has what it may take to cure the Duke's condition. A friendship of sorts forms between the two men all set amid the controversy of the Dukes older brothers affair with Wallace Simpson and the first signs of WWII.This is a really fascinating film, about a story that I'm surprised hasn't been put on film before. Not only is the Duke and Logue's story interesting, but the look at the effect of the of the abdication and the onslaught of war is also interesting. Films that look at events within the Royal family are perhaps more interesting as they are stories we don't get to see, as much of what happens is very much behind closed doors and perhaps that means that much of what we are presented with is hearsay, but like The Queen, whatever might be suggested is done so well with much conviction. It is interesting to see the amount of affection between the future King and Queen, especially against the coldness of other royal relationships, such as when King George V dies his son and heir breaks down and clutches the Queen only for her to stand rigid and unemotional. Society has perhaps been given a set idea of the Royal family, that they are on the outside rather lacking in emotion and so it is nice to see that there is under the pomp some humanity.With the era beautifully recreated the film looks great and there are of course excellent performances, with Bonham Carter and Rush both very good, but it is Colin Firth who again shows what a fine actor he is and it would appear the award givers agree as well, with accolades beginning to appear. The film provides a fascinating insight into an interesting time in British history, especially of Royal history and does so with enough sentiment, but not too much as well as providing some very funny moments, most of which come through the relationship of The Duke and Logue. I did struggle with the amount of swearing the Duke spat out in one session with Logue, it all seemed out of character and over the top, but otherwise this is a very enjoyable and well made film.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",8,0,0,16 December 2010
Fight Club," Fincher's best
","I saw this some 10 years ago when it first came out and I may have seen it in between then and now, but I couldn't remember. Having just watched Seven recently I thought it was time to revisit Fight Club. For it's day Fight Club stood out as a hugely original piece of film making. Utilizing brilliant techniques and special effects, it was quite something to witness. 10 years later, the film still holds it's own. It truly is a great film and stands out among a Hollywood filled with mediocre. Knowing the outcome, that Tyler is not real, makes a second viewing a altogether new experience, as the viewer finds themselves aware of scenes with the key characters in and figuring out how or where it is possible to have the characters and their actions work. The cast is fine in this, I especially liked Helena Bonham Carter in this. The visual elements make for a great film experience as well: The explanation of the explosion in the apartment: the appearance of Ikea furniture: the decrepit house and the airplane ripping apart are many of the stand out moments. There is some graphic violence, but it never seems to get too violent, despite it's nature.There are also some great film making in jokes: love the subliminal images of Tyler and as Tyler describes it 'flashback humour' when at the end the film continues on from it's opening scene.For today's world of 'Avatar' film making Fight Club remains a stand out piece of film making which is at times brutal, at others funny as hell. Combine this with some brilliant techniques and you have a terrific film and probably Fincher's best.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com.au",10,3,6,20 July 2010
Iron Man 2," Good fun but not as much fun as the first film.
","Iron Man 2 follows on from the hugely successful Iron Man with Robert Downey Jr reprising his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man.This time Stark reveals that he is Iron Man and denies access to companies and the military who demand to know the secret behind the suit. Enter Justin Hammer, a weapons manufacturer trying to replicate the suit and Russian Ivan Vanko who wants revenge on Stark and you have the basic set up. Set among an Expo Stark enterprises has set up and continuing the sexual attraction between Stark and Pepper Potts the film is a lot of fun.Some nifty action sequences including one during the Monaco Grand Prix keep the film moving at a good pace and the introduction of Natalie Rushman adds more sexual fun. Stark is a cheeky chap and the film is laced with some nice humour, with his constant jabs during a Senate hearing or his staff being buffeted about during the fight at the Grand Prix. Downey Jr has fun in this role and so too does Sam Rockwell with Hammer and Don Cheadle in the role of Lt.Col. Rhodes, with Scarlet Johannson doing a nice job as Rushman.The first Iron Man was a really enjoyable romp, with much more humour throughout and it's sequel feels a little tired and flat for the most part. It's also it seems more of a set up for future films based around The Shield/Avengers of which a plethora of upcoming films are hinted at including a sequence after the credits obviously highlighted the film Thor. This might excite some who are fans, but I found it a little annoying, but perhaps if you don't really follow these things, you might not pick up on them.It's a fun film, even if it's predecessor is better, but like many of these films is you don't analyze it too much (like how does anyone fly with that suit exactly and where does all the ammunition go?!) you have yourself a perfect DVD for watching on the sofa with chocolates and snacks, which is exactly what I did.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",6,2,4,14 February 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," Brilliant, edge of the seat thriller
","This Argentinian film start slowly for me and felt a little formulaic in it's story. Yet it progresses well and becomes more and more engaging. This is helped by some fine performances, the fact it looks beautiful and there is some nice orchestration throughout.Just as the character if Benjamin becomes consumed by the murder of a young woman and him and his colleague try in vain to find the culprit, we the audience are suddenly drawn into this world inextricably. We too long for answers, we too see the love the grieving husband has, hoping only to know who did this to his wife. His love and the strength of it shocks both us and Benjamin.The was a point in the film where I was utterly consumed by the story; as the camera soars over the soccer stadium, i was stunned by the brilliance of the scene as the cameras then becomes part of the soccer crowd. Following that we are thrown into chaos as they search and find the suspect only for a fast and thrilling, yet brief chase ensues. I think it is one of the finest scenes in a film I've witnessed, so brilliantly executed. From this point on the film doesn't let go: The scene of interrogation, as the suspect is broken down or many years later when he enters the lift and removes a gun, the camera holds still as we see the fear and tears across the faces of Benjamin and Irene, the scene is so amazing, my body tensed up until the very last moment. The film is at times tense, sometimes funny and often very moving, I thought that it encaptures so many emotions so well, all that one would expect, for instance when Morales is informed of his wife's death, the control of the director settles on Morales as he mumbles away, stifling back tears as the news sinks in.The film is perhaps let down by the desire or love between Benjamin and Irene, one that plays out throughout the story and is eventually resolved by the end, although the use of the motif of her running after the train at he start and then at the end of the film is nicely done. Despite this there is little to fault the the film, which is a near masterpiece and deservedly won Best Foreign film at the 2010 Oscars.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",9,2,3,23 August 2010
Batman Returns," So much better than the first Burton Batman outing
","Three years after Batman Tim Burton was back with the caped crusader and what a difference a holiday makes. Batman Returns is very different from the first outing. Firstly it oozes Burton, the musical score that plays from the very outset is very reminiscent of other Burton films, it has that element of fantasy and whimsy to it.The style of the film is different. Gotham City is no longer dark and ominous, but more lighter, there's more colour and the sets and back drops seem to work better and look more realistic. That adds a much more enjoyable element to the film and makes it more watchable. But there is more to like in this film. The villains are fantastic in this. Danny DeVito is brilliant as the creepy deformed Penguin, his performance is so good, combining a dark character with hints of DeVito's comic side. Michael Keaton returns in this sequel and he's good, but again he has little to do really. Christopher Walken also does a good job, but he is less Walken in this and that seems a shame. However the stand out here is Michelle Pfeiffer. Playing the hard working secretary who is reborn as Catwoman, she is brilliant. The contrast between the Selina and Catwoman is perfect, with her Catwoman being sexy, sly and full of wonderful lines; the scene where she says 'Meow' before the building blows up, may be the best delivered singular word line in movie history! There are wonderful fight scenes between her and Batman that touch on the campness that can be found in the TV series and Batman gets to play with some more toys and vehicles. The Penguin's mob and the theme of Freaks and circus's also work well and also show the Burton mind at work.It's amazing how different the two films are and how much better and more enjoyable this one is despite the same director and movie studio being involved. The next two Batman films in this outing had different directors and actors playing Batman and were very much disliked. It would have been interesting to see what had happened had Burton stayed, of course he didn't, but at least we still can enjoy this.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",8,6,12,5 September 2010
500 Days of Summer," Summer is okay...better than winter.
","I didn't know what to expect from this, but I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and it got some good reviews, so what the hell...Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the best thing, but it does try and that's a good thing. JGL is very good in this, he makes a good leading man, but I struggled with Zooey Deschanel's character, she seemed just a little too kookie and perhaps the romantic in me wanted them to work out. The film looks good as well, Los Angeles has never looked better, in fact I thought it was perhaps Seattle. There are also some various techniques employed to make the film a little different: There is the drawing of the park with has the number counter, although the clacking noise used really grated my nerves. I liked the 'fantasy' sequences, the one where Tom dances his way to work was great. Also the scene where the picture changes to a drawing. Another technique used was a split screen to portray the real and fantasy events of when Tom sees Summer at a party after they have broken up. Potentially distracting, it worked well, but I did begin to think at that point that maybe the film makers were trying a little to hard to be 'indie'.The ending for me was a particular let down, it just seemed too contrived and convenient, the fact that the woman's name was Autumn made me cringe. But in all this is a good Sunday sofa DVD, which has a lot to enjoy, including some great music such as The Smiths.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",7,1,2,21 June 2010
The Way Back," Epic, but far from engrossing
","As war begins to rage in Europe and Poland is split between Germany and Russia, a young Polish man finds himself in a Gulag in Siberia in squalid conditions among a motley group of men from various backgrounds. Conditions are horrific, made worse by the harsh winter weather and life is made even worse if you are chosen to work in the mines. One inmate declares he knows a gap in the fence and a group of inmates decide under the cover of a winter storm to make a run for it. They manage to get away, far into the surrounding forest as the blizzard rages around them. But being free of the Gulag doesn't mean total freedom, not only do they have to fight the elements, but there are wolves as well a bounty given to locals if they capture runaways and somehow of course they have to get out of Russia.The men make their way south, with the idea of getting to China. It's a long way, through the frozen lands of Siberia and along the way one of them succumbs to the elements. Further south, they pick up a young woman, another runaway Pole and on reaching Mongolia they discover that Communism has taken hold there, meaning safety is not guaranteed, leaving them the only option to cross the Gobi desert and make their way to Tibet and over to India.This film by Peter Weir is based on the 'true story' - although that's been debunked- and it's an epic tale. The journey is huge, yet somehow for most of the group they will endure anything to survive and get back to those they love. It should be an engrossing story, but it really doesn't manage to maintain interest. For starters this mammoth trek feels like a mammoth (cinema) trek, which goes on far too long; I found myself not wanting them to reach safety for themselves, but for me as I couldn't wait for the film to end. Also, it's difficult to relate to these people, some are criminals, some are viewed as criminals by others, but we rarely get to know more about these people other than a few snippets gathered (conveniently) by the woman. Because of this it's difficult to find an emotional connection to these people who by all accounts are going through a huge life altering journey.It's a shame as it really should be an engrossing story, but it all feels very formulaic in it's presentation and while performances are okay, with actors playing various nationalities and there's an abundance of accents (and surprisingly all the characters speak fluent English!), the film just drags towards the end and it's main redeeming feature is the glorious variety of landscapes that fill the screen.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",3,28,57,30 March 2011
The Town," terrific second film
","This is a really terrific thriller that backs up Ben Affleck's career as a director after his first film Gone Baby Gone. It wastes no time in setting up the premise of a gang of 'serial' bank robbers and the volatile state they find themselves in. Of course a hostage is taken which leads to some very clever plot devices, including a spot of romance and hidden truths.The film looks great and never gets too bogged down in the harshness of 'The Projects' or the reasoning behind the bank robbers. The robberies themselves are executed brilliantly and are full of tension as is a scene where Afflecks character and Clare have coffee only to be interrupted by another of the robbers who of course is mates with Affleck's character Doug. Clare is of course unawre of the fact that she is dating her captor and the friend is the one she saw the tattoo one. It's so well played out, I think I was gripping my arm a little too tightly. The whole cast are excellent in this and there are great turns from Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner.The ending is perhaps a little expected, but right up until then it moves along seamlessly. Affleck does well handling the scenes where tension is needed, car chases through narrow streets are remarkable. There are also a couple of nice moments: when the robbers park the car only to notice as they jump out a cop car right opposite and also when Doug calls Clare at the end and asks if he can meet her and we see him watching her across the street as she lies that she is alone but is surrounded by FBI.Affleck himself also shines in this, not only has he never looked better, but he actually acts well in this. You can almost forgive him for Gigli. Almost.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.webly.com",8,1,3,26 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," It's nearly all over!
","This must go down as contender for longest film title although I think Borat may claim that crown. So we are nearly at a close! 7 books and 7 films later with one left and finally we can put Harry Potter to bed for a good nights sleep. He needs it.I'm not even going to begin to explain the plot in this latest installment, part 1 of 2, that the seventh and final book has been stretched over. The film is enjoyable, with some great sequences, lashings of special effects all of which look great on the big screen, a stellar cast of Britain's acting elite and hints of comedy and romance as Harry Potter and pals battle on towards what we can only expect will be an epic showdown with Voldermort.I read the first four books, but lost interest and haven't ventured further, but I have seen all the films (although I can't remember all of them enough to rate here) and whilst my interest isn't exactly enormous, I feel duty bound to see them through to the end, after all I've come this far. For true fans this will be enough to excite just as much as previous films and no doubt frustrate that it's been split into two with most having to wait until June 2011 for the final installment. For me, with my mild level of interest there is a lot to enjoy, but because I'm not a huge fan I struggled at times trying to keep up with it all, who's who, what everything means, not that it's excessive difficult to understand. My other issue is that the film is just so long, at two and half hours it pushes my limits for watching a film, so goodness knows how younger fans cope. . Still, that aside the film looks wonderful and there is something er, magical about taking a ride with Harry Potter et al. The rich imagination of J.K. Rowling is vividly brought to life with multiply Harry Potters in one scene to people flushing themselves down the loo to get to the ministry. It's for the most part all good fun, a little darker now as the story reaches it's climax, but overall it keeps as the saying goes the magic alive.More review at my site: iheartfilms.weebly.com",7,0,1,30 December 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Way funnier than I ever expected
","I went to see this despite having a very mixed but mostly negative selection of reviews. I'm very glad I went as this is one of the most enjoyable and funny films I've seen in a long time.Michael Cera plays the slacker who meets the girl of his dreams only to find out he has to battle her 7 evil ex's. Throw in some slacker friends, a gay housemate, a couple of previous girlfriends, plenty of computer game references and you have a very entertaining film. There are some really funny moments in this, it's really rare to find a film that makes me laugh out loud, but I did a lot throughout. It's also very clever story telling and adding to this are many more slightly less but still funny moments as well as an array of special effects which provide some great visual moments. Clever editing and quick cuts are used to move the story from place to place, effects are used to provide hints of the films comic book basis, but it never goes overboard or becomes repetitive.There is a great support cast, including a very funny Chris Evans, but Kieran Culkin as the housemate and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau also provides some laughs. Michael Cera is a real standout here. He is a very funny actor, though many of his post Arrested Development roles have been, well his Arrested Development role. Here though, whilst he never quite breaks the mold fully, he is less Michael Cera. His timing and delivery of lines is perfect throughout.My main qualm with the film is that it struggles with the story telling time frame. It starts quite slowly and the first few battles happen progressively, but suddenly the rest of the battles are grouped up together which then leads to an overly long finale.However, these issues shouldn't be enough to put anyone off seeing this. It's a funny, visually great romp and you don't need to be a computer/comic book/superhero nerd to enjoy it.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",9,5,17,3 September 2010
Dirty Dancing," The 80's produced some excellent movies
","This is one of those films you should have seen at least once in your life, but I realised part way in that I haven't actually seen this. Though of course this ultimate 'chick flick' is so very known, it's difficult not to feel you've seen it.I was surprised to see it set in the 60's, I presume it was a present day and was rather disappointed by what felt like a lack of recreation of the era, it just didn't feel very 60's. It's not really necessary to detail the plot, other than it really is boy meets girl. The story is quite standard, yet it's done quite nicely and even delves into darker territory with abortion and the perils of promiscuity being sub plots.The leads Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze work well together, with Swayze a handsome lead and amazing to think he was 36 when he made this. Grey is nice as the innocent discovering herself, but I did find her a little too plain. The film's main element for me were the dance scenes an there's plenty of dancing to be had. The leads are excellent dancers and the choreography and camera work are very good; there is also a good soundtrack.The film has legions of massive fans and it is perhaps easy to see, it's quite a classic story and over the years has spawned a bad sequel and a plethora of wannabe films as well as many skits, parodies and references; one of the films most massive lines, indeed moments is when at the hotel's end of season show, Johnny comes to get Frances and says 'Nobody puts Baby in a corner', but I was quite taken aback at the delivery of this, it seemed really abrupt and almost done so quickly that if you weren't paying attention you may have missed it. Still the ending is quite rousing by the time everyone is up and dancing and ultimately there's a lot of fun and a lot to enjoy in this light romantic drama.More of review at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",6,0,0,15 January 2011
Zombieland," Great Zombie romp with a film stealing cameo...
","I really enjoyed this zombie flick, though some of the early scenes grossed me out a little, which is something new as usually it takes quite a lot to make me squirm. It did seem a little excessive to start with but settled down as it progressed. Jesse Eisenberg is very good in this, although I felt at times he has the potential to be stereotyped in the future, the next Michael Cera? Still he provides some laughs with his characteristics and mannerisms. The rest of the cast do a great job as well and Abigail Breslin is far from her Little Miss Sunshine persona.There is a lot to enjoy in this film, it looks great for a start and utilizes some clever ideas, the repatition of the Rules is very well done and never becomes annoying or clichéd. I liked the scenes of the foursome chatting in the car, but above all there is the scenes with Bill Murray. Utterly unexpected, his cameo makes the film and is utterly priceless. The fact that he is dressed like a zombie to fit in just screams Murray, he really is a joy to watch, it's just a shame he has to die! All in all this is a fine comedy horror, it's not perhaps as good as the British film Shaun Of The Dead and whilst they clearly draw comparisons, they are both good films in the their own entities.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",8,2,4,27 June 2010
Burlesque," It could have been worse!
","Small town girl goes to the big city to make it big. Really? Haven't we seen this before? Well of course we have, but we've never been on this journey with Cher! Christina Aguilera plays the small town girl, who makes her way to L.A. to make it big. She lands in the Burlesque club run by Tess (Cher) and starts to wait tables while trying desperately to let Tess give her a go on stage. Meanwhile she shacks up as friends with barman Jack and befriends property developer who has his sights on the club.Of course Tess does give her a job and everyone is astounded at her talent and the club thrives. Along the way Ali, treads on toes, gets heartbroken and becomes something of a star, while then discover the true meaning of Marcus's interests and therefore saving the club and helping Tess (mother figure!!) and the romance with Jack can blossom. Hurrah! The films story is pretty standard; small town girl, the young handsome barman who also writes songs (lets hope Ali get to sing one!) the divaesque star of the club who's limelight is stolen and the charming, but obviously has something else planned man. But despite all this the film rolls along very merrily and is really quite entertaining. Set mostly in the club, the director may have watched films like Moulin Rouge, Cabaret, Dreamgirls or Chicago before walking on set, but there is a great visual style to it with well staged musical numbers which are quite catchy, with only the slow ballads being a bit cheesy. Perhaps the burlesque element is a little bit of a modern interpretation, with only a feather fan number alluded to traditional burlesque, but that aside the musical numbers make the flow of the film move well.Aguilera is quite good as Ali, though it's not a big step away from her normal performing persona. Cher of course is Cher and doesn't really have to do anything, she's just great; there are two handsome lead male characters and while it seems Stanley Tucci came from the set of The Devil Wears Prada still in character, he is fun on screen and there is a nice relationship between him and Cher.The film never really goes anywhere and the plot is painfully obvious, but it also never becomes too serious and the issues are light in their nature with only a brief foray into the a story about drinking. In fact the film is quite good fun, with some nice moments throughout, such as when Ali arrives at Sean's apartment only to find a male guest with neither of them remembering each others name.Not as bad as Showgirls, but without as much style or drama of Moulin Rouge or Cabaret, this is still an enjoyable romp that's a lot of fun.More of my review at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",7,2,4,17 January 2011
Inception," Nolan's new work is well dreamy...
","Firstly, let's get the bad stuff out of the way. Luckily it isn't a film related but more to do with the cinema. I saw this on a stupidly small screen that didn't justify a big film like this plus the cinema had terrible audio with the film's dialogue being at times barley audible, whilst much of the other sounds being crystal clear. This really hampered my enjoyment to some extent as I struggled to hear what was being said and it is a film that had a lot of explanation happening.So the film, well it pretty amazing, it is a hyped up film that lives up to its hype. It looks incredible for a start, everything visually works, the settings, the styling and the special effects. The cast are all very good. Ellen Page is far the annoying Ellen Page we've seen before and Leonardo DiCaprio is really great in this, in fact I like him more and more as he gets older. The stand out performance for me is from Marion Cotillard who is not only stunning, she proves again that she is a fine actor. I'm yet to see her in anything that she hasn't been good. The films start is perhaps a little confusing-not helped by the lack of audio- but gradually it becomes more coherent. It is a truly original and exciting story, although similarity to other films can be made, this hold it's own absolutely.The story is an exciting and gripping one and despite the long running time, it flows along brilliantly. The blending of reality and dreamworlds are executed perfectly and whilst the film relies on special effects, they are so dazzling that it barley registrars. There are some spectacular images, the streets of Paris folding over on itself is breathtaking and then there is the use of slow motion, when the street scape starts exploding in Paris or when the van falls towards the water and we see the sleeping occupants follow gravity. One of my favorite moments is during the later scenes where Arthur-played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt- in a seemingly weightless world runs around a rotating room and corridor and then ropes the bodies together placing them in a lift. I was so amazed by this, yet struggled with how it was done, it look like it was filmed in one of those planes that achieve weightlessness.This is an all round impressive feature that shows that Christopher Nolan is a remarkable film maker. I think it's a film that deserves several viewings to fully appreciate and understand it, but one that is well worth it.more reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",9,2,6,24 July 2010
The Runaways," Better if your're a fan..
","When a young Joan Larkin renames herself Joan Jett and manages to introduce herself to music manager Kim Fowley the ball is well and truly rolling. 15 yr old Cherie Currie auditions for the band and The Runaway are born. For this young girl group, success comes eventually with a recording contract and a tour of Japan where they realise the magnitude of fame, something that perhaps takes it's toll on the young band members. As the story progresses, so do the girls, as they discover love, sex, drugs and booze, while back in the real world family matters get ignored and priorities get mixed up.All based on real events with The Runaways being the beginning for some of the members having long careers, well Joan Jett at least, this film is for non fans a sort of coming of age movie set against the music industry that is quite standard in it's story. It is then lucky that we have a stylish looking film which also has two fine performances at it's core. Kristen Stewart is far from her Twilight days as Joan Jett in this and actually shows she can perform well, but the real surprise here is Dakota Fanning as lead singer of The Runaways Cherie Currie; her performance is really superb and shows how much she's grown.The film isn't a stand out for me otherwise, it roles along well, but it really does feel too standard in it's format. Those who are fans of The Runaways or Joan Jett will get more from this, however there is enough to enjoy to make this good sofa fodder.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",5,2,3,17 January 2011
The Social Network," Fascinating story of the other side of Facebook
","It's a rare thing that I've walked into a cinema screening a new release that's been open for 4 days on a Sunday afternoon and struggled to find a decent seat. That was what I found though when I went to see The Social Network, it would appear that like the founding of the website it features the film is becoming a social phenomenon. I also found it interesting to see that perhaps ⅔ of the audience were of a certain more elderly age.You may not be on Facebook, but you'd be hard pressed be among the few that haven't at least heard of it. It is perhaps not important though, because as a film The Social Network manages to convey a fascinating story regardless of your user-ship of the involved site. David Fincher is an awesome talent and despite my reservations of this project when it first surfaced it is a very accomplished piece of work. Direction here is extremely tight, the story is straight forward and unfolds easily interspersed with moments from the legal proceedings. The way that the story unfolds is quite astonishing and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg comes across as a very clever man, brilliant with computers but also a general grasp of everything which makes him almost a little cold and calculated.Casting is great, Jesse Eisenberg is great as Zuckerberg with his quick fire dialogue, but elsewhere there is talent although I must say I struggled with Justin Timberlake in this. Dialogue and the script shine throughout and that's important as the film really is a dialogue based one, but it never falters throughout. The fascination also remains through out, the escalation of the site's popularity and therefore the financial side of events are incredible and this behind the scenes format gives you a different understanding of Facebook itself. The contrast of friends mucking around with the internet and the onset of million dollar lawsuits which in turn destroys friendships is shocking. The scenes that portray the legal proceedings where friends have become enemies and Zuckerberg almost outsmarts everyone are brilliant and for me are the real highlights of the film, yet as a whole it's difficult not to be at least a little fascinated.What is also remarkable is how Fincher has managed to make this story interesting, a quick look at this doesn't really provide a very thrilling story, but once you start watching, you can loathe Facebook or anything it stands for but still have a excellent film experience, the final outcomes and payouts are worth the journey alone, the outcome left me gob smacked. There is nothing like a good story and Facebook provides it.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",8,1,2,1 November 2010
