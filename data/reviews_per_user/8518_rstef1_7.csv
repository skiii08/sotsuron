Miracle," Rousing Sports Movie
","Even if you don't like the game of ice hockey this is a terrifically enjoyable film. Kurt Russell is excellent as the coach of the 1980 Olympic ice hockey team, all the young actors portraying the players give sturdy performances, as do the entire supporting cast. If you liked Rocky or Cinderella Man this is a must see for you. I defy viewers to keep from getting excited during the games. They are filmed expertly, you feel like you are right in the middle of all the grueling action. One of the best scenes involves the coach mercilessly working his team after what he considers an unacceptable performance in one of their games. It's a brilliant and disturbing scene that will make you squirm. The final game between the USA and Russian teams will have you on the edge of your seat, even if, like me, you know the outcome. It's just that good.Yes it is an unabashedly patriotic film, and so what? It was a time when America needed heroes and the hockey team delivered. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,26 December 2005
Salt," Another film for those suffering from acute ADD
","The action scenes are plentiful and breathless in Salt, but that does not make up for the ridiculous plot. This movie plays like a distaff version of the Bourne films, only far more convoluted. The title character is presented as a superwoman who can overcome any obstacle in her way, which may be empowering for females, but removes any suspense when she is in dangerous situations, as we begin to see that she cannot be stopped. By the end of the film, Jolie's character resembles the Terminator more than a human being. Jumping from one extended, over-the-top set piece to the next, the viewer is dragged along on a visually exciting roller-coaster ride filled with impossible loops and turns that is forgotten as soon as it is over. Occasionally thrilling, but more often had me shaking my head in disbelief. To add insult to injury, once again we have a film without a proper ending, leaving the door open for sequels. Hooray.",5,0,2,1 March 2011
Alice in Wonderland," Tim Burton Triumphant
","Tim Burton gets to do here what he does best: fantasy with a dark edge. Just as he did with his modern fairy tale classic Edward Scissorhands, Burton takes a whimsically fantastic story and gives it some bite.Remaining true to the characters and situations of the books, which for those of you who haven't read them had some dark edges of their own, Burton eschews some of the preciousness of the Disney cartoon version and makes the story more accessible to modern teens and adults while retaining the classic period feel. Depp and Bonham-Carter are perfect in their roles, and Wasikowska as Alice holds her own with them. The special effects are great. I loved the Cheshire cat and the blue caterpillar (voiced by the always excellent Alan Rickman); they really had personality though they were CG creations.This is an amazing looking film that doesn't forget the importance of telling a good story. The screenwriter has done a great job of taking Alice's 'real life' and weaving it into her journey through Underland, where she comes to a valuable realization and greater understanding of herself. A fine film for children and adults.",9,3,4,1 August 2010
The Da Vinci Code," Good stuff, if you can forget the book
","The Da Vinci Code was one of my favorite fiction books of the last few years so I was extremely apprehensive about the movie version. Akiva Goldsman who adapted the novel has had ups and downs with screenplays over the years, but when he's good, he's good. His adaptations of two Grisham novels (another of my favorite authors) fell into that category and, luckily, he's good here too.Though the film lacks some of the suspense of the book, and has sequences of the entertaining treasure hunt omitted for time's sake, it retains enough of the original charm to carry it along for its long 149 minute running time. Ron Howard knows how to direct a big exciting film and this is apparent in the Da Vinci Code. Every scene is beautifully lit and framed and manages to retain the viewer's interest despite a lot of historical exposition. Unfortunately, there is a LOT of historical exposition that simply works better in printed form than on the screen. Still, Howard gives it his best shot and largely succeeds.One criticism I have is with the finale. It doesn't feel important or exciting enough for what it reveals. The book did it so much better.Tom Hanks would not have been my first (or even fourth) choice for Robert Langdon, but he is a terrific actor and pulls it off fairly well. The supporting cast is wonderful, especially Paul Bettany as the creepy and tragic Silas, and the ever dependable Sir Ian McKellan attacks his part with relish. They, as much as the leads and director, make the film a worthwhile, if not great, view.",7,0,1,8 December 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Excellent
","When the movie first came out, I was hesitant about seeing it because I was so enamored of the J.K. Rowling book. Therefore, I avoided it at the theater. When I finally bought the DVD I was sorry I hadn't seen it at the theater as I found that the movie was a truly worthy adaptation of the book. Special effects were wonderful and the acting was outstanding, even by the youngsters in the cast. The film managed to capture the fun and magical spirit of the book admirably. I look forward to seeing the sequels if they can maintain this quality. Well worth seeing.",10,1,1,24 January 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Comic Gold
","I should say up front that I have never been a big fan of Will Ferrell. A little bit of him goes a long way. Elf was cute, but not that funny, and so I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this movie. Thank God I had a free HBO preview and some free time and decided to check out the unrated version of Anchorman on On Demand. This flick combines the inspired lunacy of Monty Python with the joke-a-minute absurdity of Airplane and comes out a big winner.First, Steve Carell is a genius with his line delivery and timing. Every time he was on screen he was hilarious (I love lamp, I love LAMP!). I'm still laughing at his intro where he cheerfully announces he is what some refer to as mentally retarded. Brilliant! Paul Rudd is well cast as Brian Fantana, a Mark Spitzian type who's good with the ladies, especially when wearing Sex Panther (it has bits of real panther in it, so it must be good). Hysterical. All the other cast members acquit themselves well, especially the under-appreciated Christina Applegate who can react beautifully to the insanity transpiring around her and gets her hilarious revenge on Ron by changing his sign-off from 'Stay classy' to 'Go F*** yourself San Diego!'. I had to replay that scene several times because I kept laughing so hard that I missed what came after.Will Ferrell has changed my opinion of him with this masterpiece of humor, both as actor and writer. As soon as I had finished watching the film a third time, I immediately ordered the special 2 disc version (unrated of course).",10,1,3,24 November 2005
Step Up," Step Off
","What dance related movies does this film not rip-off? Basically, it's an amalgam of Cutting Edge, Flashdance, Fame, Dirty Dancing, and others, with a sprinkling of Boyz N the Hood dusted on for street cred. There is not one single clich√© overlooked, not one trite situation unused in this flick. Channing Tatum seems a likable lead actor and can dance, but he can't carry the weight of this awful script on his looks and charm alone. After the first twenty minutes of the film I knew the following:1. Nora's original partner for the dance showcase will, conveniently, be unable to dance with her; 2. Tyler and Nora (played by non-actress Jenna Dewan), will triumph at the showcase; 3. Something BAD is going to happen to Skinny; 4. Supporting characters Miles and Lucy will end up together (with no believable explanation as to why); and, 5. Tyler will overcome all obstacles, while retaining his friendship with pal Mac, and help everyone else live happily ever after (except poor Skinny of course).Tyler's transformation from street punk to art school dance savant is wholly unbelievable and really ridiculous. Making it more ridiculous is the school's director ever allowing him to dance with one of the students after he broke in and trashed the school. And why would the director be willing to offer him a scholarship when she clearly points out that his vandalism robbed another student of a scholarship??? Also, I'm no judge, but would Tyler really be assigned to do his community work at the place he broke into and smashed up? That just seems stupid. Finally, I had to shake my head in amazement at the ending where, a few days after seeing his younger brother killed, Mac is able to laugh and rejoice with Tyler over his dancing at an art school for which Mac has previously shown nothing but contempt.If you can get past the trite and far-fetched situations that swamp this picture, there are some good dance numbers and catchy tunes well staged by choreographer/director Anne Fletcher. Channing Tatum may have a career if he stays far away from more films like this.",5,0,1,27 December 2006
