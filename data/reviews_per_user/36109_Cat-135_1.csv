The Blair Witch Project," You've got to be f---ing kidding...
","This has got to be one of the most hilarious films I have ever seen.First, anyone as unprepared to venture into the wild as those three 'film makers' deserves whatever they get.Second, the extended bumpy view from the moving camera angle was annoying. Someone near me in the theater started to hum 'Sailing, sailing, over the ocean blue...'Third, the over-used explicative at first was juvenile, moved onto boring, then escalated into numbing distraction.On the plus side, I could not resist drawing parallels to the excellent work of Monty Python.  All you need is a British accent here and there and you'll have an audience participation cult classic to rival Rocky Horror!  Note to Eddie Izzard: fresh material.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
