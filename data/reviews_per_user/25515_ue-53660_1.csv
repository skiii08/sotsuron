Hereditary," Horror Masterpiece
","I never thought a horror movie could be so incredibly brilliant. The absolutely amazing director is definitely a cinematographic genius. For me he has reinvented completely the horror movie genre.
It is an incredible very scary, crazy, unique, eccentric, atmospheric and totally great fun film.Sets and photography are just beautiful, sinister and eerie . Every scene is meticulously detailed, especially in the background, there is always something visually disturbing going on, moving shadows, flickering little lights, little movements, people, air movements, insects. Toni Collette is also brilliant in this movie.",10,0,2,15 June 2020
