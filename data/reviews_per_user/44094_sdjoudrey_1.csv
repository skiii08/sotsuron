The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Boring
","Big fan of the franchise, but this movie is a classic example of when splitting a movie into two parts does not add anything to the story, and just is an attempt to make more money. The lack of action in the movie was very saddening and it felt like a very long preview for Part 2. I am sure Part 2 will be awesome now, since all the action will happen, but I think this movie could have easily been 30 minutes long. The acting also just felt awkward for the first half of the movie, and it often felt like more should be happening. The reactions of the characters just felt bland and unrealistic. That being said, I still enjoy the movie. You could really connect with a lot of what was going on and when there actually was action scenes, they were awesome.",8,12,36,25 November 2014
