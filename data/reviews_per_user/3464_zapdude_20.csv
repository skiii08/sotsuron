Catch Me If You Can," Surprisingly good
","I don't remember ever seeing this in theaters, which probably shows my lack of attention. I certainly didn't expect what it was.I'm not a big fan of either DiCaprio OR Hanks, but in this movie they worked. The way the era was captured was convincing, and the performances by all of the supporting cast were great.This is one of the few recent movies I've enjoyed enough to actually buy on DVD.",Null,0,1,17 July 2003
Minority Report," Great movie
","It's difficult to avoid comparing this movie to Vanilla Sky, another excellent movie that a large number of people just don't 'get'.If you believe that most of Minority Report is improbable, then you haven't been paying attention. There are tons of things that have been tried in the pursuit of justice that seem like a good idea at the time, but are eventually discarded. Things like photo radar, for one.It is interesting reading here what people choose to nitpick. I, for one, applaud Tom Cruise's choice to move into a more thought provoking, mature type of role. He's an excellent actor that has, in the past, chosen some pretty lame projects. And I also liked the way the movie had a dreamy, washed out kind of quality, except for his crystal-clear memories, and the bright and colorful ending.I can't put it better than what another comment stated: tired of reading reviews by out of work film school graduates? Well I am. This was a much better story and overall package than The Matrix. The only problem is Matrix was first, so people scream that this is a copy. It is stunning to me that in this world of grotesquely BAD movies, a standout movie like this is called 'trash' by so many.I don't buy many DVDs, but this one goes into my library, right between Vanilla Sky and Total Recall. I rated it a 9.",9,0,0,23 December 2002
Crash," Pretty good
","This movie weaves a fantasy world of characters whose main focus in life seems to be racial. Maybe you're supposed to relate to these characters, but the stereotypes of 'racism' seemed a bit overdone to me.Anyway, after having it described to me by someone who saw it, I wasn't prepared to enjoy it.Well, getting past the obvious exaggeration that Hollywood seems to require for anything, racism included, the interwoven stories move seamlessly and create a strangely satisfying message.I was fascinated, even though the characters appeared shallow and somewhat stupid in their focus on race. Some of the scenes were a bit over the top, really, but overall it was a good movie.Worth seeing.",8,0,4,3 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Steeeeeerike Two
","George Lucas steps up to the plate... He swings the Phantom Menace, and he misses. Things are getting tense down on the mound, the pitcher is just CG but obviously so. Here's the pitch, George Lucas swings the Clones, and misses yet again.It's ok, it's not the worst movie ever made or anything, but it's definitely down there near the bottom of the Science Fiction heap.Please, oh PLEASE, stop the 'foreshadowing' crap that ruined this film. Please, don't have Annakin say things like 'One day, I'll be the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy' followed by a few seconds of the Death Star theme from the original Star Wars. Understand this: the movie is so full of this that it hurts to watch.Wooden actors and poor CG did the rest to ruin this film. There's one particular scene where OB1 and Annakin open a door. The door is CG. It's obvious, and ugly. Why not just rent a backhoe for the day, put a fancy door on it, and lift it on cue? It would have looked SO much more believable. Most CG scenes looked like garbage, and most of the movie is CG. Yes, I am saying that visually it was garbage.The original Star Wars worked because they were relatively unknown actors, and yet totally believable. Ok, Mark Hamil 'sucked' as Luke Skywalker (according to some), but to me he seemed like a real person. I live in an area surrounded by farms, and Luke was the very picture of a farm boy thrust into world events. The characters in this movie just plodded through events with no real emotion or character.Plot holes? Sigh.... far too many, and Hollywood cliches were too painful too. If you saw it, you know what I'm talking about.This was a love story according to some. Where was the love? There was no love. At no point did I believe that the two main characters had anything even close to approaching affection for each other. If this is what you think 'love' is, then I really pity you. If I had been reminded one more time 'I'm a senator' I was ready to run out screaming. And then the foreshadowing. Sigh.I paid $27 for two of us to see this movie, and I'd really like $20 of it back, along with the three hours of my time that I'll NEVER get back. This movie is for renting and playing in the background while doing other, more important, things. Like, say, ironing or cleaning the cracks in your hardwood floor.",5,0,0,26 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An awesome achievement
","I still snicker at some of the wordy trashing comments being posted here. I especially like the arrogant little know-it-all who called this film arrogant.Ever since the 1950's when the Lord of the Rings books were released, virtually every fantasy ever made can trace some aspect of its origins to these stories. Even Star Wars is based on this story, and much of the Led Zeppelin imagery came from here. Directly.To tell most stories, all you need is to pack a little two hour package together. This story is bigger than that, it is sweeping, majestic, and powerful. It is the granddaddy of fantasy stories, so to speak.The point that many people miss is that there is supposed to be ugliness, the ugly parts are to contrast the bright parts. The placid Shire goes up against the horrors of the grown-in-the-dirt Orcs, who are not exceptionally powerful as individuals, but overwhelming in numbers.This first movie is laying the groundwork for the epic struggles to follow. We are merely meeting the characters and setting the stage. If you don't have the patience to accept that this background is neccessary to tell the rest of the story, then I truly pity you.The Extended Edition DVD is marvelous. I am still struck by the incredible attention to detail and overall 'feel' of this work from Peter Jackson, and I don't think I'm being disrespectful when I say that his previous work does not foreshadow this achievement at all. 208 minutes of this movie is barely enough. The texture is stunning, in spite of the overly lingering Liv Tyler sequences and a few other minor niggles.Maybe you don't have the time to comprehend why this movie is awesome. Perhaps you can't see the value of the intense personal sacrifices being made in every scene of this movie. Too bad for you.The Lord of the Rings was written with the memory of World War II fresh in Tolkien's mind. Wars, battles, and struggle are the nature of the tale. In spite of it all, there are pockets of sunshine and peace, and these pockets are our story. Good will conquer the evil!",10,2,2,13 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I know, but it IS the One Film to Rule Them All
","It is astounding to me that you could watch this movie and not be moved to tears, impressed beyond words, and in some basic fundamental way, changed.The Fellowship of the Ring is, quite simply, the best movie made, ever.... so far. Will the next two movies match or exceed it? I hope so.Can you find flaws? (*possible spoiler in this paragraph*) Yes, there are a few minor niggling CG errors that can be safely ignored. But, the scene with the giant statues looks like it was filmed, not generated. The Balrog was awesome, the loss of Gandalf was stunning. I had real tears in my eyes, as did others around me.If I had to, under duress, find any flaw at all in casting, it would be with the dwarf... but then, we haven't really done much with him yet.I have a new love, and it is this movie.The last time I read the books was a few years ago, so it wasn't so fresh in my mind that I was annoyed by the few variations of book-to-script. Maybe it was better that way.I feel like they went on location in Middle Earth and filmed there. The film is gorgeous. I want to visit.Are you reading this to figure out if you should see the movie? If so, the answer is absolutely, positively, definitely, and without question, YES.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
The Fast and the Furious," Ewwwwwww
","It amazes me that anyone could possibly enjoy this movie. The rating here of 6.2 is far too high for what it is. Forget the fact that it's filled with Bondo'd up import cars (besides the nice car at the end, was there ever a scene containing a North American car?), the plot holes are big enough to drive a pack of cars through.Oh - did you know that the people who drive these little import boxes all seem to motor around in packs? Like motorcycle gang cliche movies from the 50's, you see.(Spoilers abound ahead)How about this one: the blame for the crimes is shifted to an Asian guy, who is arrested at his family home during a meal. Instead of being angry with the cops, the father slaps his son. Good scene. Anyway, in spite of the fact that this guy machine gunned a police undercover vehicle which we are told cost $80,000, destroying it completely, he can't be held because all they have is 'minor weapons violations'. Right.Ok - I had a stopwatch and timed the '10 second race' at one minute 51 seconds. Now, this is about par for the quarter mile times of a REAL Honda, but apparently these ones are heavily modified, so you'd expect them to at least be in the under-a-minute range, right?It amazes me that someone can blow up his motor, destroying rings according to one character, and yet drive away with no smoke AND elude cops with the exact same car just seconds later. I wish MY car would self-repair like that, it would save me a lot of hassles and scuffed fingers.The only thing I can say is, if you feel that you want to immerse yourself in a fantasy world that has very little basis in reality, where cars auto-repair and quarter mile races last almost two minutes, and cops let their quarry escape, and truck drivers don't get out of their trucks to check on the guy that just totalled his car on the truck, well, go right on ahead.Afterward, go slap a giant exhaust tip and goofy spoiler on your ugly little tin box import, then come race me at a track. This movie will not prepare you for the realities of street racing OR life in general.I rate this movie as a 2, only because of the strangely compelling performance of Ja-Rule and because the cinematography was pretty good. Otherwise it deserved a zero.",2,5,10,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Stunning
","There is just no way I can effectively summarize this movie. With the exception of the CG segments (some day, real motion will be simulated properly, but not today), this is as close as you can get to a perfect movie.The Gollum character is almost flawless, making Yoda and Dobby look pathetically fake in comparison.I feel like I have just visited Middle Earth again, like I did last year. The scenery is awe inspiring, the sets are just totally believable. Stunning. I rated it a 10, only because I couldn't vote 11.To that small percentage who don't 'get' this movie or series, I truly pity you. You'll never know what you are missing. These movies are the best ever made. Period.",10,0,0,18 December 2002
For Love of the Game," Worth the time
","If you have a short attention span, you won't like this movie. If you like the unreality factor, bad guys shooting cops and drug dealers are your heroes, you won't like this movie.If, however, you are an otherwise normal person who has ever been in love, you should invest the, what, 12 hours? ;) to watch this very well done movie.The thing is, you KNOW there will be cliches... but there are so many Hollywood cliches, you never really know which one to expect! Will he succeed? Will he fail? Will they stay together, will she stay? It doesn't matter.No really, it just doesn't matter! Because in the end, you actually feel like you have just lived these peoples lives. The emotions will choke you up and you will wonder if everyone else watching with you are turned away so you won't see the tear on their face either.In fact, honestly, I did not want to watch this movie. I didn't want to like it. But it really did draw me in. Seriously, the acting was mediocre, various and many details annoyed me... but the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts.",Null,0,0,7 May 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Disturbing, but fascinating
","Watching this movie hurts. If you can get past the horribly dated images, it tells a fantastically ugly story.Sexual images abound throughout this movie, in many cases for no apparent reason. Your kids don't need to see it.The lead character is a thoroughly despicable lout, you are supposed to hate him. And hate all he stands for. He is truly slime, and if you ever find yourself relating to this character, I STRONGLY suggest you seek counselling.For a brief time, the character is completely incapable of defending himself against the brutalities he is forced to endure. Once he regains his ability to defend himself, he returns to the same brutish, despicable lout.Visually, it truly is a gorgeous piece of 1971 film. The decor and decorations and clothing represent the height of ultra-mod at the time. Compare the visuals here to something like Space 1999 to get a feel for the time.But beware when you sit down to watch: the ugliness may be too repulsive for someone prepared for an evening of popcorn and entertainment.This is an all time classic. You could call it Science Fiction, or Action, or Drama, or Horror. Just don't call it Comedy.",9,0,0,16 October 2002
Shine," Pretentious, mediocre
","My parents bought me this years ago because I play piano. I thought the description of it looked dumb, so it has sat here for years. Last night, I had absolutely nothing else to watch, so I watched it.There are a lot of really major problems with this movie, most of which killed my ability to enjoy it.First, close-ups of someone playing the piano should be done with an actual pianist playing a piano. The old cliche of some 'actor' banging away randomly at keys while the soundtrack plays perfect music just bugs me no end.Second, the concept of the 'Rach 3' (ick) having the power to break someone is about like the Monty Python sketch about the joke that kills whoever hears it. It may make nice fiction to those who don't understand the performance of music, but it's actually also very annoying.Third, the overall tone of the movie is uneven and jerky. The overbearing father is too much of a cliche, the actor plays it like a cartoon character. Mommy Dearest meets Prodigy's Father, I'd say.I'll skip a lot of other problems, and jump right to the horrifyingly bad ending. I was about to leave the room to get some food, expecting to come back and watch the ending, but they started to roll credits! Did someone forget to end the story here or what?Maybe to some people this movie was excellent, and wonderful, or a 'celebration of the human spirit'. To me it was a perfect example of something the critics didn't understand, so they figured it must be beyond their comprehension, so they rated it highly. Bottom line: it was pretty bad, deserving of the obscurity to which it has now descended.I wish I had left the movie off and watched CNN instead.",5,7,17,12 July 2002
Titanic," In the Middle
","I managed to avoid watching this movie for years. I'm surprised that its rating here on IMDB is 7.0Considering the rabid fan base, and the fact that you could NOT escape that horrid theme song for forever, I would have thought it was an awesome movie.When push comes to shove, it's an OK movie, but it's neither AWESOME nor TERRIBLE.In short, it is a 7.0 movie, I guess.The first half is the best, the second half falls apart completely. I guess it just goes to show that the more money you pour into a project, the more you can get out.",7,2,4,2 March 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Worth fighting the hordes of kids to see
","All right, I'm in my 30's. Many of my friends think I'm odd for liking the Harry Potter books. But I do, and you can call it a solitary vice if you want.The movie was not perfect, there were sections that dragged a little, the soundtrack is utterly forgettable, but who cares? It's Harry Potter!This is the first movie I've seen lately where the special effects are used to tell the story instead of being the story. Even though there was a lot of CG in the movie, it was completely transparent. You believe that they are flying on brooms. The quiddich match looked extremely real.If certain details are missing, like the ghosts, well, they just didn't have time. The movie runs very long as it is, and still there was very little fat to be trimmed. Poor John Cleese, his character had gobs of humor for him to mine... but it was a time thing.I would say that everyone could benefit from seeing this movie, and if you haven't read the books you may have an advantage. Instead of worrying about Peeves and other details, you would be able to simple enjoy the story on its own merit.See it. Push the kids in costume out of your way if you have to, but see the movie. I promise you will enjoy it.",9,0,0,17 November 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," One of the best movies ever made
","It's incredible to me that this movie was panned by critics when it was first released. Apparently, all the junk that was rated higher has NOT stood the test of time.This is a squeaky-clean story about a man who has given up. Maybe the source of his turnaround is a little cheesy, but he turns it around anyway.If you don't get a little choked up while watching this, then you have NO CLUE what life is about. Life is about these moments.When I was younger, I didn't like this movie because I thought it was stupid. An old black and white movie with old-fashioned ideals and values. Now, however, I watch the colorized version every year at Christmas time, and I get a tear in my eye.I have made it a life goal to try to be half the man that this character turned out to be.",10,1,8,18 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Excellent. Worth the time.
","The Harry Potter franchise is one of my favorites, and the biggest reason is simple: It isn't Disney and it isn't manipulating our children into anything.I'm in my... ahem... 30's, and I see absolutely nothing wrong with being a big Harry Potter fan. (No, I don't live in my parents basement, and no I didn't dress up to see the movie). This stuff is FUN! I envy today's kids for having something so wholesome and downright entertaining to watch.This second movie was worth every penny and every second invested in watching it. It's entertaining and fun.Admission to a movie in Canada is $13.50, so needless to say I am often reluctant to pay that much for a theater experience when I have the DVD player and the big screen at home. This movie was worth it.You can nitpick and complain about something in any movie you see, and I'm not going to do that here. Overall it was excellent. I enjoy the way these movies have stayed faithful to the books, and I really wish that more book-to-film projects would do so.Poor John Cleese... still getting the big bucks for a few seconds of film time... but as I recall, there is a meatier role for Nearly Headless Nick in the next book.",9,0,0,18 November 2002
Vanilla Sky," Extremely good movie
","I saw the original 'Open Your Eyes' in summer of 2000 (see my review of that). I remember when I heard that Tom Cruise was going to redo it, I was hoping he'd be able to make it at least as good.This movie exceeded my expectations. Why? Because it was basically a re-shoot in English of an uncommonly good film.The audience in the screening I just watched was unusually silent. Many people may have been wondering what was going on, trying to work through the plot twists. From the opening scene until very near the end, it's not entirely clear why things are happening, but the final scenes DO wrap it up. You get a very satisfying sense of 'I didn't see that coming, but I like it'.There is a percentage of people who will simply never get this movie. They will think it's stupid, pointless, long, and boring. Then there are the people who will recognize it for what it is: a brilliant concept, exceptionally scripted, well shot, and this time there's a soundtrack to enjoy.If you let yourself get immersed in the characters, you may even be surprised at the depth of emotion their fates will evoke.If your IQ is over 100 (the 'average'), then I predict you will enjoy this movie. If not, send your cat.",10,1,2,17 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Stunning.
","I'm not sure I can add much to what many of the comments here are saying. This is part three of a three part epic, and in my opinion the complete package is the best single movie ever made.Just as in the books, almost every loose end is wrapped up. We all knew that good would eventually triumph over evil, but watching it evoked strong emotions. I still have the uncanny sense that Peter Jackson somehow managed to take cameras TO MIDDLE EARTH and film the actual events as they unfolded.And, more than this, I pity those few who don't 'get' these movies.In Fellowship, I had tears in my eyes at the loss of Gandalf. Sure, he comes back, but the characters don't know that!(possible spoiler, next paragraph only)In Return of the King, I had tears in my eyes at a couple of moments. My favorite single moment was when Aragorn said 'My friends, You bow to no one', followed by the entire host of men bowing to the hobbits. The scene where the Eagles pull Sam and Frodo to safety almost had me bawling, it was so beautifully crafted, and SO reminiscent of the original art in the Tolkien books.I believed that Minas Tirith existed, that somehow they managed to build the entire city as the world's largest movie set. Stunning.Unfortunately, the movies are not perfect, but what is RIGHT so outweighs what isn't perfect that I won't even bother trying to detail everything. One day, CG will be better. The transitions into and out of computer animation are seamless, but the CG characters flop around unrealistically. They also have sticky feet that allow them to stand on moving monsters without effort. Niggles, and it doesn't detract from the story.Personally, I would have liked to have seen more at Cirith Ungol, more about the end of Saruman, and the Scouring of the Shire. But hey, the Extended DVD will have this, and I can wait. Barely.I must have been one of the luckiest moviegoers this week.I managed to see this movie in a packed theater, with absolutely NO sound problems, no picture problems, and complete (actually spooky) silence from the audience at the silent parts. Nobody laughed at an inappropriate moment, nothing.I'm assuming that the majority of people who would go through the effort of standing in line for 45 minutes to get a ticket, another hour in line to get into the theater, and enduring the 26 minutes of ads prior to the actual movie would be serious fans of the series.",10,0,0,19 December 2003
Hart's War," Bruce Willis as Colonel Hogan
","We have it all here... we have the obligatory Nazi Commandant, a man who is too old and tired for fighting, but not as funny as Klink. We have our equivalent of Schultz. They're all here.But this two hour episode of Hogan's Heroes was a gruelling exercise in pseudo-historical message-movie making, and a constant battle to stay awake throughout a thoroughly boring and predictable plot.At best this is a mediocre movie, it never rises above mediocrity. It never says anything to us, the viewer. It just went nowhere. Although some who have commented here thought it was a surprise ending, it wasn't. It was predictable and, sadly, boring.The visuals were pretty, but hasn't the Nazi POW Camp theme been done to death? Obviously, I'm intrigued by the theme or I wouldn't have rented the DVD, but this movie was two hours of background for two minutes of meaningless nobility.Sad, really.",6,0,2,27 July 2002
Windtalkers," Tremendous disappointment
","There was an opportunity here to tell a great story, an otherwise unknown story from WWII. Tragically, they took the easy way out and made an inaccurate, ugly, and messy war movie.I really wanted to enjoy this, but I certainly didn't. It had an amateur feel to it that was almost laughable in spots. Every outcome was telegraphed from miles away, taking away any possibility of suspense or surprise.Painfully predictable, unnecessarily graphic, wanton death and destruction for no apparent plot reason.Is Woo attempting to single-handedly rewrite the history of World War II?This movie could have been a work of art, but I found it to be ugly and ill-conceived.I was very disappointed, and rate this as a stinker of the highest order.",5,1,2,21 November 2002
Gladiator," Garbage, but expensive garbage
