The Blair Witch Project," what is scary
","Yeah I do agree: The movie is scary. It's scary that so many people like it, it's scary it made so much money and it's scary that it coasted so much: cmon $60.000 for a product like this is too much - it's not like they even went deep into the forest (all the time is apparent that they're near the forest rim). The most scary part in the movie for me was that I almost dislocated my jaw from yawning.It's also pretentious - the movie I mean. They try (and fail) to make U believe that the movie is a real footage of a bunch of bozos that got lost in the forest. The also managed to convince some of the (scary part is that some refers to quite a lot) people that the whole idea is tremendously original - well it isn't. For one the unsteady amateur like camera: That was done  several times before (and with much better affect, for instance in 'Man Bites Dog'). And having amateur like unsteady camera is one thing, but the picture being so bad that its barely watchable hkhm... People getting lost in the wilderness and faced with extreme conditions: Much (MUCH) better done in 'Deliverance'. People getting on each others nerves: 'Who's afraid of Virginia Wolfe '. People going slowly insane: has anyone seen that play 'Caretaker' or 'Birthday Party' (by Harold Pinter) and finally people doing stupid things: what about 'Dumb and Dummer'.Well since acting on some parts is even better than the local amateur theatre group so I rate this movie 2/10.",1,0,3,21 August 1999
