Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar and his people must die
","Alright, let's see here, this movie could have been a great movie.  The things that ruined it are quite obvious to the general public and I can't see how George Lucas could've seriously added such crappy little kid characters to the saga.  Jar Jar is the most annoying character I have ever seen in a movie.  The stupid gungun or whatever it is, should have been like Chewy, just stand there and every once in a while get annoyed at C3P0...that's exactly why wookies are awesome.  Talking aliens, alright, but talking alien sidekicks that are overused in the movie-hell no.This movie isn't all bad though, if I were to see it again I'd look for a bunch of hidden stuff, and of course, the AWESOME fight scene with Darth Maul and Obi Wan and Qui Gon.  Hidden stuff to see next time:E.T. is in the pod racing scene, and I think I saw the guy that played 'Willow' in that movie from the 80's...anyone else think so?",6,0,1,3 June 1999
Empire of the Sun," Most overlooked Spielberg Movie
","I had never heard of this film until a few months ago when everyone was talking about Saving Private Ryan.  In one of the behind the scenes shows they showed, they said Spielberg made a lot of wwII movies, and they showed that clip of 'Empire of the Sun' when Jim is jumping up and down and yelling 'B-51 cadillac of the sky!!!' and I thought it was awesome.  I decided to rent the movie and I just couldn't understand what made this movie so overlooked.  I mean, it didn't even get nominated for best picture OR director.  Even though lots of critics disliked it, they couldn't have helped but seen the start of Spielberg's emotional wwII movies.  I mean, this movie has all the ingredients of a great emotional Spielberg movie:great script (which by the way was written by one of those involved in Shakespeare in Love...), great acting, 'a little lost kid'(there was a lot of that in Schindler and also Upham in Private Ryan), and of course, the great John Williams score that always adds that extra emotion. I mean seriously, a lot of scenes in that movie were just John Williams moments...like the scene where Jim throw the plane back to the Japanese guy, and of course, the b-51 scene.  If you're looking for an awesome drama, especially after seeing Saving Private Ryan, this is a good calmer wwII movie that still manages to make you feel like crap in a way(and Spielberg is now happy).",7,0,2,4 April 1999
Born on the Fourth of July," A really powerful movie with a few flaws
","This was a really good, really emotional drama that deserved more recognition.  Just like what happened to Saving Private Ryan this year, Born on the Fourth of July was robbed at the Academy Awards in 1989, it just got the director award, which, by the way, was well deserved.  Oliver Stone has created a movie that will never be forgotten, and in my opinion, is one of his best.  My only complaints about this movie were the scenes in Mexico with Willem Dafoe and the Mexican prostitutes, those scenes were really not that necessary.  Also, if you can't stand a movie 2 and a half hours about Vietnam without that many battle scenes, this movie isn't for you. Honestly, that's what I was expecting from this movie, but I thought the lack of battle scenes were for the best, because I personally think that's why I didn't like Platoon as much as this movie.  This movie is probably the most realistic movie of all time when it comes to what war does to people. It doesn't just paralize some of its soldiers physically, but also emotionally.  If you've ever met a Vietnam veteran you know what I am talking about.",5,3,7,24 March 1999
