Blade Runner 2049," Run as fast as you can away from BladeRunner 2049
",Bladerunner 2049 is a pale predecessor of the original. While it attempted to draw from the dark ambiance of the original it fails at anything but a sad inept copy. The two female leads were clearly supposed to remind us of Daryll Hanah and Sean Young but the dialog and plot lacked to blend these bits into a story. The flat affect Ryan Gosling has throughout the first 2 hours was painful to watch. From the moment they announce a a missing son of a replicant you know it must be Gosling but we suffer through and hour of pointless plodding dialog and story line. I expected much more from this movie. It was dull and unoriginal. RUN AWAY,1,8,17,15 October 2017
