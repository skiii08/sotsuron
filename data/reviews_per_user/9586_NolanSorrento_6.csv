Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The perfect opening to a trilogy
","I'm not too sure what people were expecting from this movie. Maybe something sinister or maybe they've just forgotten the pure simplicity the first series had, especially, `A New Hope'. I personally thought this was a great intro to the prequel series. You have your quick introductions to the characters and the opening to what will lead into a darker/heavier storyline. The CGI was amazing, but I will have to say that even though effects enhance a movie they do not make the movie. The battle scenes, with the ability to show things that the previous movies could only dream of creating, were amazing.I love how they showed the full power of lightsabers by slicing a door open and how I got to see fully trained Jedi's in action using the force to bowl down opponents. These are things, that growing up, I always wondered about.As for the characters, to see a young Kenobi was very cool, seeing how he wasn't always the patient mellow one made him a much more 3 dimensional character. The most interesting person was Anakin, yes, I won't deny, I wasn't too keen on the kids acting ability, but we got to see Anakin's drive to do the right thing, which will make it more interesting for the final blow that pushes him towards the darkside. Also, we got to see what Kenobi meant with a lot of the things he told Luke about his father i.e. `He was a great pilot'.  Now for Jar Jar, everyone hates this guy, but I took a totally different look at this character. I didn't see him as Lucas's little show off display of  `look at what I can do'. Jar Jar to me served a function, he was the one that initiated the joining of forces, and he also is the one that helped hide the Jedi's. I'll probably get attacked to no end for saying this, but I believe he served a much bigger purpose than Chewie. Don't get me wrong, I loved Chewie, he was the bad-ass of the galaxy, and yes, he's Han's co-pilot, but face it, what did he really do? Plus, I'm also going to have to throw in: Jar Jar isn't in episode 4 - 6, do you all realize what that means? Yup, he's going to die somewhere during episode 2 or 3 he's going to meet his fate. Now before you all jump up and cheer, also remember, Lucas is doing this, he's probably going to do it in such a way, everyone's going to weep for this `annoying' characters death, and all of the sudden he'll be as cute and favorable as an Ewok.Overall, I'll stick to my guns and say this was a great movie, it's the initial set-up to a heavy duty trilogy that's going to end on a very sour note, unlike the happy Disney-esque ending of Jedi, where going to see Anakin get pushed over the edge when his mom die's and then get his butt kicked and left for dead by Kenobi, which of course will lead into the intro of the Darth Vader suit. Also, it's going to be a slaughter, everyone who wasn't a character in 4 thru 6 I figure is pretty much going to get wiped out somewhere along the line of 2 and 3. Hopefully then, everyone will be satisfied with how the trilogy went.",Null,0,1,20 April 2001
Unbreakable," Not another Sixth Sense.
","This is probably the best movie to come out this year. Yes I know that's not saying alot, since this has been one of the worst years in movies since the 80's, but Unbreakable is a really top notch movie.  I just want to warn all of you that do goto see this movie, DO NOT GO IN EXPECTING TO SEE A REPEAT OF THE SIXTH SENSE! Yes this is a real thinking movie, yes it's got one hell of a twist for and ending, but this movie has nothing to do with dead people.  This is a movie that goes into a much more surreal environment, the world of comics, but the way M. Night Shyamalan does it, is incredible, not once did I feel like I was watching some cheesy flick and expect people to have bullets bounce off their chest or fly thru the air and to make you feel better, it doesn't happen.  I really spent the whole time just watching and waiting to see how it unfolds. I will not deny, sixth sense didn't take much to figure out what was going on, I knew the answer half way thru the movie, but Unbreakable, doesn't end with an answer in that way, it ends with probably the most incredible eye popper I've ever seen in a movie.See the movie! I can't wait to get the DVD, this is one of those movies, like, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and Usual Suspects, The (1995) where I can watch over and over and I know I'll just keep picking up those little visuals and pieces of dialouge that I didn't notice before.",7,0,0,20 December 2000
Underworld," Nothing new (spoilers)
","We all knew that this movie would be using a lot of flavoring from both The Matrix & from Blade, but I didn't realize it was going to be using look-alikes from some rock bands and a real live version of Battle Angel Alita, so here's my review, and bare w/ me.Vampires & Lycans (werewolves) are at war w/ each other over a reason, shrouded in mystery. The division of Vampires that we get to see is lead by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, & the primary warrior of his crew is Gally from the movie Battle Angel Alita. The Lycans are headed up by Rob Zombie. Rob Zombie is hunting after Scott Stapp, the lead singer of Christian Rock band Creed. Supposedly he's got a special blood type that is all but a myth.Of course as luck has it, Gally falls for Scott Stapp and gets booted out of her club for conspiring w/ the enemy. This leads her into the typical superhero storyline of proving herself right and also getting to do the I-told-you-so thing when it all goes to crap for her home team.The rest is about as typical and you already can guess the ending. On a plus side I do want to speak highly of the visual f/x, excellent for the viewer who needs to study that rather then the story.",4,0,1,20 January 2004
X-Men," It's a fun movie, but ends up being to plot driven (spoilers)
","Let me start off that yes I understand that nothing can be directly translated from one medium into another without making a few tweaks here and there (Leather and Vinyl does look better than spandex on the big screen). I also believe that comics get  no respect in the film industry compared to an actual book, I don't really understand this, when a books translated, people always complain that they left so much out, and then proceed to tell everyone that the movies a horrible adaption, but when it's  a comic, any changes seem to be overlooked, why?  Comics will have more stories than any series of books could hopefully wish for, the X-Men have been around since the 60's but nobody seems to mind all the weird things that happen in the movie.  Okay, now onto the reasons and the SPOILERS, so stop here if you haven't seen it yet.The whole movie seemed to center around Wolverine, if they where going to go this route, they should have made a movie called Wolverine and then make sequals called the X-Men.  Thru out the whole movie you get to see Rogue's powers and the fact that people go into a coma like state when she uses it, so why is it that Magneto is still up and going in the last battle when Rogue has just 'zapped' him?  Magneto even states to Sabertooth that he will be in a weekend state and needs his protection.  Storm is really underplayed in the movie, she's truly is my favorite character in the comics, do you remember the scene where Sabertooth grabs her by the neck, why didn't she shock him? Why was he able to knock her around until they got outside? Mystique has the ability to imitate anybody's appearance but not their powers, yet in the movie she has Wolvie's claws and appears to be just as dangerous with them!  The writers and directors saw it fit to make the big screen Jean Grey from two characters in the comic, Moria Mctarget and Jean Grey.  There's a character name Bobby Drake (the one who gives Rogue the iceflower) who was one of the  original X-men, so that would actually put him closer to Cyclops and Jean Grey's age.  I really found all this really fustrating, if you can't relate, think about how Jurassic Park was for all you people who really enjoyed the book, and think about how the movie and the book really differed, and you'll understand my fustration.
Okay, now I'm sure all of you are reading this and saying I'm being to picky, but the point of this all is, is that the movie became really plot driven, in a way that they decided to change the way the characters function during the climax just to help the story along i.e. Storm vs. Sabertooth and how Rogue's power did not effect Magneto, this is usually considered really bad story telling but for some reason people don't seem to mind in this movie, I guess special effects are really what matters now from what this movie is scoring.",6,0,0,1 August 2000
The Polar Express," Even kids dislike this movie.
","A friend of mine asked me what I thought of this movie, I told her that it really wasn't that interesting, it felt like a lot of the situations in the movie that were just designed to fill up time. She told me that I probably felt that way since it's aimed for kids. I had to disagree on this one since I noticed a lot of the kids were getting restless while watching this movie.A really easy way to judge if a 'kids' movie is a good 'kids' movie is simply watching them in the theater. About 30 minutes into Polar Express I noticed that the kids around me (ranging from about 4-12) started doing more then just ask their parents basic little kid questions, they started wiggling around in their seats in that 'I'm bored' fashion little kids do. Then throw in they started asking the really confused questions since they couldn't tell visually what was going on (little kids don't really pay much attention to dialogue unless it's a really funny one liner or mixed in w/ slapstick humor)Now if you're about to jump all over me stating that this is just what little kids do, since they've got the attention spans of goldfish, I'll have to disagree. The week prior I saw The Incredibles, and the reaction of the kids in that audience was the complete opposite of what I sat thru in Polar Express. In The Incredibles the only thing I really dealt w/ was kids hoopin and hollering to all the excitement, action & slapstick going on. I don't remember any kids breaking out in tears because they started getting bored, or bothering anybody w/ goofy questions because they couldn't tell what was going on. Instead, they just sat back & had a really good time.So what have I learned from all this My general opinion of this movie fits the general opinion of the audience it was aimed towards. The movie is drawn out and boring.",3,10,23,24 November 2004
Fantastic Four," Things I would've done differently
","...or at least liked to have seen in the movie I thought the FF movie was a bit to slow for a comic to film adaptation. Instead of all the endless chatting about pitying regarding The Thing, watching Reed & Sue fumble thru a relationship & seeing Johnny trying to be a big stud. They could've picked up the pace & at the same time keep the story they wanted in tact.Things should've been more on-the-fly, instead of this endless slow pacing there should've been sequences of them being forced into their superhero roles against low end super powered villains & your common thug. I wouldn't have them attack these situations as a team, mostly as individuals & maybe the occasional duo, fumbling their way into saving the day and learning their powers at the same time.With this pacing, things wouldn't have gotten so boring for me, Johnny would've learned how fly way ahead of the game & instead of making his ability to fly an (un)exciting moment at the end of the movie they could've instead chose to make it his ability to control what part of him burst into flames (i.e.: saving some hot chick from a deadly fall by shutting off the flames around his arms and catching her) Sue & Reed could've fallen in love when Sue noticed that Reed is a man of action in the heat of an intense situation, instead of the generic walks on the park and discussion of problems.As for Ben Grimm, it would've just been cool as f/ck to see him get into a super-powered bar room brawl on Clancy Street.The ending would've pretty much gone the same way, they join together as a team and fight doom, but it would've been a lot more interesting, and the battle would be more complex rather than each doing 1 single power ranger move. It would've been heavier attacks by both Doom & the team with a much more climatic ending.",5,0,1,22 July 2005
