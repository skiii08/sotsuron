Walk the Line," Sometimes everything you need is to walk the line
","To walk the line means either to choose your own way and to devote yourself to it completely, forgetting about everything, or to lose it and lose yourself at the same time. The problem of choice iis the main idea of this film, the choice between the dream of one's life or family. 
The film isn't really dynamic, but it shows the main character, Johny Cash and his story, as a real person, not idolizing him, because he is first of all an interesting personality. In his childhood he couldn't devote himself to music, but as he grew up and the story follows, we get to know that there're only 2 important things in life for him - music and June Carter, who was performing with him, and with whom he fell in love unrequitedly. So the film is about love as well, as Johny was really happy only with June.
The story was actually written by James Keach (a friend of Johny Cash and his family). It took 4 years to make him agree to sell the author's rights, to shoot the film took also 4 years.
The actors who play the main characters were chosen by Johny Cash and June Carter themselves (Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon) an not without a reason, because these actors are very talented ones, and not only actors but singers as well. All musical pieces in the film were sung by them without any help of professional singers; Joaquin Phoenix learned to play the guitar during the shooting.
This film can be an excellent example of a biographical film, and I highly recommend it to all music lovers, fans of Johny Cash or to all people who like the brilliant actor's play and interesting plots.",7,1,1,12 May 2018
