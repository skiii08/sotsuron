Hereditary," Didn't See The Ending Coming...Nor Did I Want To
","Hereditary was a good drama with some tense and thrilling moments for about an hour and 45 mins or so. Then the final act fell apart.The last 20 mins felt like I just watched a Donnie Darko inspired remake of Rosemary's Baby. Just in case anyone is wandering, that isn't meant as a compliment.",3,3,6,25 August 2019
The Death of Stalin," Satires Of The World, Unite
","The Death of Stalin is good satire about the power struggle that ensued after, well, the death of Stalin. I'm sure there are people who will pick away at historical inaccuracies. Ignore them. This is satire not a documentary. I don't look to this movie for historical perspective any more than David Irving would look to Life Is Beautiful for a deeper understanding of the Holocaust.Reagan once quipped that he couldn't get anywhere with the Russians because they kept dying on him. This movie has a similar problem. There are funny scenes that are Marx Brothers and Python-esque, but then it throws in the occasional mass murder and execution.That shouldn't deter anyone from watching it though. It's running time clocks in at 1 hr 47 mins and there are enough laughs to justify sitting through to the end.",6,0,1,18 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Moved A Little More Into The Shallow End
","There are some good laughs scattered around Deadpool 2 but all of the meta and self-referencing humor wore out by the end of the credits in the first movie.Occasionally they try to throw in a one liner aimed at social and political targets. For example, there's a George W. Bush 'Mission Accomplished' joke that's about fifteen years too late...and it wouldn't have been funny even if it had been on time. If you get all of your political insight from Trevor Noah and Stephen Colbert then I guess this material is for you.There's also groan worthy attempts at appealing to the #metoo movement, LGBTQ groups, and other Social Justice millennial groups. I wish writers would realize that these people are not capable of laughter or joy and its not worth the effort to try and entertain them.That aside, just like the first one, Deadpool 2 is at its best with slapstick comedy and over the top violence. Unfortunately, that's hard to maintain for 2 hours. I guess that's why the Three Stooges made short films.There's some good moments of parody in there as well. I especially liked the credits that mimicked the Roger Moore era of James Bond title sequences. Moments like that make Deadpool 2 momentarily worth watching. Now if they could just get Ryan Reynolds to quit ad-libbing to the camera how he's in a Marvel movie, then there would be more time for better jokes.",5,3,5,4 March 2019
The Shape of Water," Drowned By A Bad Script
","'The Shape of Water' is filmed by an artist but written by an immature man-child. It's a sort of 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Creature From the Black Lagoon' mash up with some themes that Disney would target to an 8-year-old.During the opening scenes we see a naked female masturbating in a bath tub, which would seem to indicate the movie to follow is targeted towards a mature grown up audience. Instead, we get something on the same intellectual level that can be found in a book that teachers would read to 3rd graders.I guess the more liberal viewers will be ok with its portrayal of white, straight males as being the real monsters, no matter how clich√©d and intellectually boring this has become. For some reason there's a heroic sidekick who seems unnecessarily gay, i.e., it serves no purpose to the plot other than to serve as a contrast to the cruel, uber-hetero alpha male and main antagonist portrayed by Michael Shannon.There's just enough sex, violence, and language to get an R rating, which would have been fine in a movie with a script that was mature enough to handle it. Its a real shame the script is so puerile because it's beautifully shot and looks great. In the end its hard to imagine this being enjoyable by anyone who reads above a first grade level or has maturity beyond a thirteen-year-old who gets titillated by a naked woman in the bathtub.",3,4,8,18 October 2018
