Ford v Ferrari," Great story of determination, will, and living life in the fast lane all while developing friendship.
","'Ford v Ferrari' is a well done and in depth long drawn out biography that does give good focus to the auto industry and how power and greed intersect with it. As it tells the true story of the legendary race in which Ford challenged Ferrari and would come out on top as an automotive leader.The scenes are tense and heart pounding often gripping with tension as the gear shifts on the lane, yet things also shift in life for industry and the characters involved. As showcased are the power struggles and corporate problems of industry like greed and doubt however when the Ford GT is developed it breaks the company free to win around the curb of the tracks!Most compelling and interesting is seeing the friendship form between car designer Carroll Shelby(Matt Damon) and hotshot race driver Ken Miles(Christian Bale) as despite the drama and thrill of the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1966 a bond and lasting and listening friendship is formed between the polar opposites! Overall good touching film of showing how fast speed won over many with love and friendship the film was really paced well and mixed with fun and drama for a near perfect finish lap!",8,2,6,16 November 2019
The King's Speech," Emotional and touching. It will uplift your spirit a very well done courageous work of art.
","I must say that clearly 'The King's Speech' is one of the better films I've saw in a long time. It's historical and it can be classified as an emotional drama a brave work of art of how one man King George VI(Bertie) overcame a speech impairment stammer just to speak! As you watch you will feel touched with emotions as the film blends moments of humor, anger, and courage so well together.Set in 1920's Great Britain it follows the life of Bertie(an extraordinary performance from one of the best actors around Colin Firth)and he's a well and mild mannered Englishman who's happily married to royalty in Queen Elizabeth(Helena Bonham Carter)and Bertie enjoys the company of his two daughters also. Yet for such a good guy he's got a nasty problem and that is he speaks with a bad speech stammer. As Bertie nearly puts audiences to sleep as his words struggle to get out.Only hope is found in the form of Lionel Logue(a top notch supporting performance from Geoffrey Rush)a down on his luck and failed England stage actor. Never fear Lionel has the talent of teaching speech even though his methods are unorthodox as they include singing, humming, and reading slow some of these scenes are compelling and funny yet moving as this training brings out the anger in Bertie only for his good as he can now use it to face his fear.Aside from the conquering of a speech problem a bigger problem is on the way as with the passing of Bertie's father King George V and with the failed and scandal plagued reign of his brother David it forces Bertie to be next in line for the throne. And having a speech therapist by his side is a must as the newly King George VI must give a commanding speech of courage and confidence to the nation as war looms with Hitler and the Germans.Overall great film with 'The King's Speech' you will laugh, feel pain and be emotionally touched. It's one courageous film and a great work of art with A+ performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. You will feel your spirit lifted and aside from the drama and historical importance of the film it teaches a message of courage and it proves a person no matter what throne they sit on must overcome a personal defect impediment while having the faith and courage to lead a nation.",9,1,2,17 January 2011
The Lobster," Different type of film a parody and allegory of humans and animals that's tied to finding love.
","'The Lobster' is certainly a different film one that's a little tough and difficult to watch still it's theme is a parody allegory between humans and animals still it's entertains and the concept on finding love is neat it would really be crazy if it was like this in the real world. This picture is set in the near future and it stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, and John C. Reilly as the film is a funny romance that involves sex, and lust while the search for love is a must happen. Centered around David(Colin Farrell)a recently divorced man who's search for love is in a 45 day time limit, and the bad news is if he's still single he will be turned into a lobster now wow! And along the way the scenes of humans and animals is portrayed into a funny watch and the sex scenes are a lustful eye full! Just imagine if real life would be this way it would have many trying to kidnap a partner and they would do whatever even if it means tying them up and gagging them(as portrayed in this film). Overall 'The Lobster' is a different kind of film still it's message is far out, but it makes the person search for love and happiness in a different universe overall neat concept parody and allegory type film. As they say we are all animals!",8,0,3,12 August 2016
Moneyball," Win with computer stats and number generated statistics?
","'Moneyball' is a pretty interesting take on how to win at the game of baseball. And it's enjoyable and relevant because it's based on the true story of real life Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane and how he turned around the team with the help of an Ivy league graduate computer whiz Peter Brand, plus it was based on a book by Michael Lewis. Aside from that it's thoughtful showing the inner workings of brain trust of how to manage players and the under worked deals of putting together a winning baseball team. Plus the film has realism by showing actual baseball footage so the viewer can feel he's watching the big leagues.Also the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill is top notch Pitt is to be believed as the stressed out and rugged go against the grain Beane who clearly takes a different approach to winning. As he proves instead of heavy spending to build a team he seeks the help of a computer educated analysis director in Peter Brand(Jonah Hill joys it up). And while watching you see the feel of an underdog developing as Billy wants to win as he remembers his failure when he didn't develop into a big league star. The film is drawn showing the viewer some intrigue and drama yet just like the big baseball climax it wins in the end. It's a good feel to see winning can be done a different way, this film did indeed hit a home run.",8,0,1,11 October 2011
First Man," A film of visuals and determination with the power to land.
","Space movies are okay, and this one was a historical biopic which had me in as I like history and people. It's well done from director Damien Chazelle for it's telling of the life and times of 1961 thru 1969 of one Neil Armstrong(in a pretty good performance from Ryan Gosling). As it goes right up to Armstrong's landing on the moon. The scenes and close takes of aircraft and space images rival that of '2001 A Space Odyssey'.Still the film is of inner mystery and life showing the cost and risk of space travel as it takes power, will, and determination to orbit a dangerous mission. Many scenes are intense and a struggle still the film is a journey of passion and desire. As the landing on the moon is the accomplishment and you the viewer feel some of the same joy that the central character feels after the landing which is a true accomplishment.",7,1,1,16 October 2018
Black Swan," Painful. Visually raw an entertaining psychological thrilling drama. It's very wicked and sexy it proves a profession sacrifices the body and soul.
","I must say 'Black Swan' is visually stunning in a crazy and raw kind of way, and in the meantime it leaves your heart bleeding with sorrow and pain. One thing is for sure and it's true that many of us can relate to and that is in a profession or line of work it's tough and most of all as this film proves it's a sacrifice to one's body and soul especially if one's going for perfection and clearly the lead character here Nina is trying her best. Director Darren Aronofsky('The Wrestler') is one who's known to go over the top as many of his films show the pain and dark side of life and clearly with this mind guessing thriller drama 'Black Swan' Darren clearly pushed the envelopes to the edges as after viewing you will feel exhausted with satisfaction. Yet despite the accomplishment your heart will feel the pain and sorrow that came from the dark transformations and mind changes that little Nina went thru to obtain grace and face her demons.Set in New York city young Nina Sayers(done brilliant and emotionally raw by the beautiful Natlie Portman)is a hard working and up and coming ballet dancer. Nina is working her butt off to impress as she has to stay busy training when she receives constant stress and high expectation thoughts of success from her lonely ex ballet dancing mother Erica(Barbara Hershey). Then a window of opportunity opens up as in the cutthroat business of dance a former lead dancer Beth(Winona Ryder)is let go. Now it's Nina's turn for the lead role in the production of 'Swan Lake'. Nina is ideal for the role of the white swan, yet from the get go she feels dogged and stressed by the great deal of pressure that's put upon her by her coach and instructor Thomas Leroy(Vincent Cassel). It's almost like Nina feels like a black swan already.To complicate matters in what is really the most wicked and psychologically engaging and highly entertaining parts of the film is the work of Lily(Mila Kunis in such a raw erotic wicked performance) who is Nina's rival dance performer and Lily's the ideal part for the Black Swan. Only a tricky and cruel plan is in the works Lily will take Nina on a mind numbing wind journey of total transformation in my opinion and this will put Nina more in the form of an actual Black Swan! The performance from Mila was so great as her character Lily who's such a free spirit really rocks the boat as having Nina to come out of her shell and engage in hot lesbian love making just makes for some sweet eye candy especially seeing Kunis in a sexy black bra. Aside from that Nina feels overthrown with pressures from all three as the expectations of Thomas, Erica, and Lily's wicked cutthroat cat and mouse games have Nina on the edge of a mental and nervous breakdown. Interesting seeing how she's even resorted to masturbation to prepare for her lead role as the Swan. As many scenes are visually explicit not just the peeled skin, bumps, bruises, and blood scars but clearly you see in Nina's eyes she's like a possessed woman both mentally and physically as she's grown into the Black Swan literally.Overall 'Black Swan' is a film that proves to aim for perfection it's a sacrifice with many struggles both mentally and physically. And even though Aronofsky showed that the goal can be obtained in the end as Nina did, still it comes with great sacrifice and sorrow as really Darren went over the top as his outcome and message will disturb many as clearly Aronofsky proves life can be dark even in the world of dance. Still aside from the sorrow and pain the film brings it's well blended with determination and will power that obtains satisfaction and highly enjoyable seeing one explore some of their wicked ways like Nina did as it's a little fun being wicked and sexy. The performances were top notch from both Portman and Kunis you could really see these two actresses were really inside their roles in fact it was reported that Portman said she felt she was even gonna die in real life on set while doing this role. 'Black Swan' is well done even though hard to enjoy it shows that life is tough, and that sacrificing in a profession can be wicked, raw, and emotionally disturbing especially when perfection is obtained while the body and mind goes thru a psychological transformation.",8,13,27,2 January 2011
Changeling," A harrowing and emotional drama that shows corruption, yet it has us all seeing hope in the end.
","'Changeling' is a well done drama that is styled perfect to form as an emotional mystery from legendary Clint Eastwood(who once again proves he's a fantastic director). Based on a real life case that actually happened Eastwood as a director captures the time period just perfect with the backgrounds of the 20's and his musical scores set up each scene just perfect, once again it's fabulous work from Mr. tough guy.Anyway it's 1928 in Los Angeles, California and Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie)who's a single mother who's making ends meet by working as a telephone telegraph line supervisor enjoys life. Her main love of life and reason to live for though is her precious son Walter(Gattlin Griffith). Then all of a sudden her world comes crashing down after she returns home form work one evening to find that Walter has suddenly vanished. This is only the start of a hellish nightmare for Christine, as this film takes on a new path of it's own as the main spotlight showcased is the incompetence and corruption of the L.A. police department. From the way the case is first handled only to really take a tailspin when they claim they have found the son of Ms. Collins only she clearly sees this is not her son.'Changeling' is also a good spotlight to show how authority does not like to meet questions and provide answers as this is the case when Christine is forced to take a boy who clearly isn't hers. It only worsens when she questions the manner and tries to stand up for answers as we the audience see the film take off on more of a cruel and emotional grind as Christine is subjected to punishment that she doesn't deserve by being institutionalized and at the same time being threatened with more and more intimidation. As you watch you really have to hand it to Jolie her performance is in top form and emotionally heartfelt maybe the best of her acting jobs.Good supporting work is found in local Rev. Briegleb(John Malkovich)who's one of the few to fight for Christine as he knows all about the history of the corruption of the L.A.PD as it's with his help that some justice in a moral sense is obtained. Only the film takes on more of a mystery direction in which we as the viewer see some justice has been served, yet we really don't feel any closure except the fact that corruption and abuse of power has finally been exposed and it showed the real L.A. police.Overall well done film by Clint the setting and mood is emotional and it searches for truth and justice, and Angelina's performance is probably the best work of her time she's really into her role both mentally and spiritually. Really it's how you as the viewer see it sure it provided some justice, yet the closure was somewhat of a letdown only as with the way it ended just as in life many times we just have to hope for hope. As long as we have some hope all good is possible just remember hope can be found in anything.",7,7,11,9 November 2008
Frost_Nixon," Well crafted and done in a witty and fun manner of talk show style showdown of polar opposite styles and intelligent cunning minds.
","Ron Howard who always does such good work in film for the fact that he's such a film student and loves history. Really does fine here it's no wonder his latest work 'Frost/Nixon' is such an acclaimed and worthy film for the fact that it's historically significant. Adapted from Peter Morgan's screenplay it does such a good of retelling of the 1977 actual interviews between British Comic and newsman the liberal and sharp David Frost(Michael Sheen) and ex president Richard Nixon(Frank Langella). As for once as many may not have seen the interviews the film does it's best to search for answers and the truth about the Watergate scandal. It's a great connection to show how politics and journalism changed forever. Thanks to Ron Howard for bringing the Watergate topic back to many Americans it shows that they could be educated about it.As you see during the film the interviews Frost even though a comic is as sharp as ever as he pressured 'Trickey Dick' into the tough questions about Watergate and Richard is as cunning as ever. I'm glad one human being had the guts to search for answers that man unexpectedly was David Frost. The film is good to watch for historical reasons even though it may not have brought closure at least it explores for the answers in a witty and fresh challenging way as all Americans deserved a right for the truth and Ron really puts good effort into showing how the behind the scenes candid truth searching would put us more at ease. See it 'Frost/Nixon' is a great historical film that had the guts to question the Watergate scandal and at least it tried to hold the powerful accountable(Richard Nixon) in some form by facing tough questions. And Langella's performance of Nixon is wonderful as no one could have done it better from the accent, the motions, and actions and the walk he captured Richard so well. Watch it for the performance of Frank Langella if nothing else.",8,2,4,31 December 2008
Walk the Line," Wonderful. Plus you get charmed by Reese Witherspoon.
","I must say 'Walk the Line' is an excellent biography type film about country-rock legend Johnny Cash. From start to finish you are not only entertained but informed also, and the acting and music during the film is just magnificent you often sense you are watching the real Johnny Cash and reliving his life over before your eyes. Also Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job portraying Cash, his actions and looks and singing manners are realistic. Most of all this film educates you as many like myself learned plenty about Johnny it begins with his humble upbringing in rural Arkansas on a farm with tragedy striking that causes Johnny to leave for the service and to later settle in Memphis. From then the film does a good job to show how Cash got started in the business by making records locally in Memphis, TN and just little by little he starts to tour around only to meet the young innocent and popular June Carter(Reese Witherspoon). Going along as this film shows the touring and many like the actual singing which was good and you feel as if though both the voices of Reese and Joaquin are really John's and June's, to me I find the transformation of these two central characters relationship the most pleasing. Little by little John who stays on tour all the time, and drags away from his wife and kids becomes more attached and falls for the charm of June. Also the up and downs are portrayed nice showing that John went thru the tough period of drugs and alcohol, before finally coming to terms and getting his main love in life June Carter. This man in black has to travel the rocky road sometimes, but his faith and good nature pulls him back in the end. I must say this was a very charming performance from Reese Witherspoon, she was just so nice and fit the part of June Carter so great her skills and talent showed off with a great singing voice! Reese was well deserving of her Oscar win, she's now America's true sweetheart! Overall this movie was a great true story of a country-rock legend that educated and entertained while both showing highs and lows and ending with a couple that loved one another.",9,0,1,18 February 2007
Gremlins," A memorable cult classic remember never feed them after midnight!
","I still remember this 1984 cult classic called 'Gremlins' from watching it as a kid till still watching a viewing from time to time the film is memorable and downright fun a good little treat and a funny and strange tale involving little green monsters, and last but not least don't forget crew leader the mean stripe! Set in the made up town of Kingston Falls havoc starts to develop during the Christmas season after a nice guy yet wimp bank teller Billy(Zack Galligan)has broken 3 important rules that involve a pet he received from his dad Rand Peltzer(Hoyt Axton). The whole town even Billy's crush and cute girl Kate(Phoebe Cates)start to notice the appearance of little green monsters all over the streets as they go into stores and homes to wreck havoc and do bad destruction. As after the rules of feeding after midnight and exposure to bright light and water formed the 'Gremlins' and ring leader stripe it has the whole town on high alert leading to funny and good little battles with green monsters! Overall cute, fun, and crazy little film directed form Joe Dante that proves follow those three little rules most important never feed them after midnight!",10,0,1,17 August 2014
The Incredible Hulk," An all right reboot of a superhero and TV legend, even if it seems comical and arduous.
","'The Incredible Hulk' clearly this time around is a much better version than the one that Ang Lee made in 2003. As this time we see a film blended with more comedy, action, and less dramatization. From the start we see Ed Norton looking graceful and well prepared as he fits the role perfect for Bruce Banner the research scientist turned angry Hulk who will hide out in the slums of Brazil. Plus a good theme of character study is shown as Banner must do his own anger management control. Banner himself we see as a conflicted man not wanting the power of the Hulk yet his power is wanted by the service of the army enter Gen. Ross(William Hurt)who plans to harness the Hulk as a weapon in which leads to a showdown that goes across the globe. Memories are brought back by old 'Hulk' fans as Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee have cameos. All during this action feast the Hulk is a rampaging force that can blast off even the biggest and baddest weapons the military has. Good chemistry is found in the film with his love interest Betty Ross as Liv Tyler does a fine job. Overall a better take on the green giant it's worth a watch if you want to see some roaring action.",7,2,5,14 June 2008
Requiem for a Dream," A dark addiction film that shows how propaganda, lust, and substance sells and will control one's life!
","If you watch the films of Darren Aronofsky you know that they are dark and often about how life can be tragic and often near the end or on the way out. And I finally watched this classic cult gem 'Requiem for a Dream' and this film is indeed gritty and dark as it shows how the themes and issues of media propaganda, culture, lust, and substance abuse can control and overtake life as we know it. Set in the depressed area along the abandoned beaches of the Coney Island in New York you have a lonely widow in the legendary Ellen Burstyn who all she lives for is to watch TV in her apartment as the info salesman is selling more and more on her as it will take her wallet and her soul. Along with that her son Harry(in one of Jared Leto's first roles)is a drug addict as he lives for a heroin needle to be stuck in his arm and his buddy Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) is the king street dealer who helps supply it all. To round out the trio is Harry's girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connelly)who will sell her body with lust for drugs, money or any favor she can get. This is a film that shows people with no hope will gain happiness thru addiction, yet it showcases just how powerful addiction in the form of media propaganda, substance abuse, and selling the body can overtake one's life. Overall this is a dark and powerful satire of addiction that one must see.",9,0,1,12 April 2014
Captain Phillips," A cat and mouse game set at the waves and high waters of the sea!
",I must say that 'Captain Phillips' is one film that's full of drama and tense moments it doesn't let down a viewer's pleasure as it tells the real life 2009 U.S. cargo hijacking in fine form. Though it's long and drawn out the film takes it's time and it's compelling showing the dark and different contrast between Somali pirates and U.S. cargo members. In 2009 a dark occurrence happened for the first time in 200 years a U.S. cargo ship was taken hostage and hijacked as the U.S. MV Maersk Alabama was taken over by deadly Somali pirates. And the ship's captain Richard Phillips(done by one of the best in the business Mr. Tom Hanks)endures the most horrible voyage a deadly cat and mouse game of pros and cons and yes and no's with the pirates. Head leader Muse(done so dead on and stone cold by Barkhad Abdi)is so ruthless it's scary. Anyway thru it all this film is a harrowing drama of tense moments with life saving decisions and choices as the waves and waters twist and turn at high sea! Overall well done tense drama nice to see a real life rescue mission go so well!,8,0,5,12 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A pretty good and informative way to start an epic series!
","Growing up in the late 70's and early 80's 'Star Wars' movies were my thing something that I grew up with having loved the first three films. Then in 1999 George Lucas started the story back this time with the release of the prequels. Finally after many years I watched Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace. Well I must say that to begin an epic that this was a pretty good try as it's informative and the story and background sets up a development of some central characters that we later come to know in the Star Wars universe. The central theme of episode I involves two Jedi Knights who take a young boy under their wing for Jedi training. Yet it all begins with the evil trade federation trying to tax and overtake the planet of Naboo, as even the talks and political work of Queen Amidala(Natalie Portman)can do no good. So a plan is acted upon to travel to the sands of Tatooine as the queen and the Naboo people are accompanied by two Jedi Knights(Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor)and it's here before starting battle against the trade federation that the discovery of a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker will have an impact on all involved. Later the younger Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor)will take young Anakin under his wing to train despite doubts from the top brass Jedi people. Along the journey and battle everyone is guided along just fine by the fun loving yet funny Jar Jar Binks a character who brings great comic relief to the film. And in an epic battle of good facing evil and light facing darkness both knights face and battle the evil Darth Maul. Overall what more can be said this prequel episode I was a good way to start an epic as it was on spot with development and character introduction that would set the stage for the flight and lift off of the Star Wars saga.",8,5,7,17 December 2015
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Good coming of age film that reminds you of your high school days of trying to fit in.
","Watching 'The Perks of being a Wallflower' is one of those films that takes you back to the days when you remember trying to fit in. As in high school you always wondered if you were in the right clique or not. Everyone had their own it was the snobs, the rich, the beautiful, the jocks and the nerds and brains. Here which was a great story it's set in Pennsylvania a high school freshman Charlie(Logan Lerman)is a guy who sits out on the bench away from the action, as maybe he's got a right due to past problems. Anyway in a surprise and a dream come true for any kid two free spirited seniors Sam(the sexy Emma Watson)and her open and blunt stepbrother Patrick(Erza Miller)take Charlie under their wing. And this flight is a discovery of friendship, first love, parties, and sexual feeling all while remembering a troubled past and on going rough present for Charlie's mind. Overall anyone can relate to this remembering good and bad times of fitting in and finding discovery as high school days were filled with the good and the bad this film is one to see bringing back memories for a searching time for most.",9,2,4,6 May 2013
3:10 to Yuma," Good rebirth of a dead genre(the western) even though Mangold makes it long and drawn out it's compelling, interesting and tragic.
","If you watch movies you know that more and more over the years the western film has slowly and certainly became a thing of the past. Here James Mangold returns to the genre some even though this is a remake it's well done, long and thoughtful and ends like many westerns tragic. It was good to have a rebirth of the genre by having star power here with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe and your typical life struggles and shootouts of the old west make the drama more compelling. Bale stars as Dan Evans a civil war wounded vet who's behind on his ranch payments needing help and hope that comes in somewhat an unexpected form. As Crowe stars as Ben Wade a rugged outlaw who robs a stagecoach, is captured by small town enforcers, so then to earn money Evans promises the law and government he will help transport Wade to the Yuma court for trial and possible prison sentence. And like all good westerns this film is about journey, shootouts, growth, and most of all it touches your emotions and shows just how life can go sometimes and turn out and like many westerns the big showdown turns out to end unexpectedly. Really a good crowd pleasing movie that interest you.",7,1,4,7 September 2007
Ali," Well done sports drama biography of a historical legend in and out of the ring.
","'Ali' is more than just a boxing movie about perhaps the greatest heavyweight champ to have ever lived, it's also a personal historic drama about the man's life of struggle to find who he was in and outside of the ring. Actor Will Smith is true to form in his performance as Ali and Jon Voight is memorable as sports broadcasting announcer Howard Cosell, as their screen chemistry is in fine form and plus the boxing action shown seemed real and action packed.The film follows over a ten year period with Muhammad Ali winning the title at a young age upsetting Sonny Liston, and then his first love is played just fine by Will Smith's real life wife Jada Pinkett Smith, as their would be many loves and ladies in Ali's life. Then the film is a showcase about Ali's struggles to accept and reveal his real religion that being Islam. And this even causes him to stand up and speak out against the war and say no to a draft. And to complicate matters it's a legal conviction and a fist from Joe Frazier that sends Ali spinning for awhile. Yet thru faith and work all turns around for Ali.Then it's on to 'The Rumble in the Jungle' against the now champ young and big powerful George Foreman in 'Zaire' which as all knows turns out to be the defining moment for Ali's life in and out of the boxing ring. Overall well done film that's long with facts and drama it shows that a legend of sports can be historic for the way he fought in and out of the ring as Ali was a fighter on all matters of belief and life.",9,0,3,9 February 2016
Ghost," Your spirit will believe! One of the best of the 90's.
","When seeing 'Ghost' 16 years ago with friends, and family I knew that this film would go down as a classic and it did it's one of the 90's best films. The movie in my opinion is so successful because of the many themes it's associated with it's not only a love story, but also this film has plenty of comedic moments while at the same time the main characters face a web of betrayal. The plot is well written with many turns as Patrick Swayze gives a strong performance as a New York City banker, who is gunned down and killed right in front of his sweetheart(Demi Moore)and all of this is over a dirty investment scandal. 'Ghost' then gets very interesting when the Swayze character finds out that the after life does indeed occur! He can see people, but they can't see him! Never fear the only hope is to team with a psychic(Whoopi Goldberg who rightfully wins an Academy-Award for best supporting actress) to uncover the truth behind his murder and to rescue his love(Demi Moore). Overall this movie is a great romance that touches your heart, and makes you appreciate your loved ones especially after their gone. The laughs are also good with Whoopi and it's nice to see the now late Vincent Schiavelli have a small part as a subway ghost, who helps Patrick believe in his supernatural powers. Overall again one of the best movies of the 90's that taught us love, hope, and made us a believer that our past loved ones could be ghost. Also this picture helped make Demi Moore a superstar in the 90's, as she would earn 12 to 15 million a picture during this decade.",7,10,12,11 December 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A classic. A nonstop action adventure thrill ride!
","After many years I just once again viewed the start of the 'Indiana Jones' saga that being the first film made in the series 1981's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' watching it as a kid was more enjoyable, but still the film is a joy ride to watch due to it's nonstop action and thrills it provides. In a way this is a classic B type movie that pays tribute to something you would see just for outright fun with it's action and thrills. And hand it to the master of adventure and escape that being Steven Spielberg who with his direction just sweeps a viewer up off their feet. Plus combined with his teamwork of George Lucas who produced and helped add facts into the story the two maybe made the best adventure series of memory.Set in 1936 Harrison Ford as archaeologist and part time adventurer Indiana Jones decides to part out from his college to meet up with his feisty ex Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen)and they plan a search for the powerful and mystical Ark of the Covenant. Along the way their biggest challenge will be fighting the religious crazed Nazis plus add in dodging booby-traps, and staring down deadly snakes. This film scene after scene is a thrill ride a true cliffhanger of adventure and joyful excitement. This would clearly be the icon role that Harrison Ford is most remembered for as his 'Indy' role is more respected than his 'Han Solo' role in the 'Star Wars' films. Overall great action adventure film one of the best made of all-time.",8,0,0,21 May 2008
United 93," A grueling tribute to families of 911 victims, even though it's with emotional terror and sadness.
","I must say after watching 'United 93' that the way Paul Greengrass did this film was greatly set up and done with excellent realism. It seems that every scene that is done seems so real and it's with believable dialog and super acting. I love the way the sets are filmed from everything from the inside of flight 93 airplane to the air traffic control center, as each moment of this movie unfolds the viewer can keep up with the drama and terror. Also the scenes are shown on monitor of the World Trade Center blowup and the control center scenes of the crew picking up the hijacking of other planes are well done. This movie wraps around the events of 911 perfect from the hijacking of all four planes with the big focus on the 93 flight and the take over from terrorist. The last half of the movie is disturbing as the terrorist overtake the plane in a brutal manner from stabbing passengers and bringing pure hostage horror to the unlucky forty people aboard. In the end these forty people are the real heroes as flight 93 is the only plane that did not carry out the demands of terrorists. Now talk about real and brave human soldiers. Thumbs up to Greengrass for making a film to show the painful terror these people went thru, and it was nice to give their families one last look to honor their memory and to put a final closure on letting the brave ones rest in peace.",7,0,2,11 February 2007
It," A clown curse! The past legends haunt a town and it's kids!
","I never read the Stephen King novel 'It' as his works are long and drawn out, still I knew it's popular take and I like horror films so naturally I checked out this big screen take. And really this picture has plenty of gore, blood, and fright scenes to try and to be scary in an old fashioned kind of way! The story is simple it takes place in Maine upstate in a small town and the kids all around seem to have a problem of disappearing and seeing sightings of a strange clown, as one by one it's not safe to go out as a curfew is in place all over town. Yet thru history and research it's found that these clowns and missing children have been around for decades it's like it's a history curse. And these kids in town have their own problems of being bullied, yet never fear the clown eats and kills the bad bullies too! Overall pretty good take that's with plenty of blood, gore, and murder it does it's best to bring out fright and fear.",6,8,16,10 September 2017
Chinatown," Pretty good crime detective film, with a hidden plot that has the viewer guessing. And one of the better and darker films of the 1970's.
","'Chinatown' is certainly one of the better films of the 1970's, though the plot is at first a little hidden causing the viewer to search for it. Only this ends up being a pretty dark and clever mystery. 'Chinatown' is set in bright and sunny Los Angeles, California during the 1930's, and many scenes are memorable from the sets used like the houses, and the backdrop of the California skyline and desert. Jack Nicholson is Jake Gittes a veteran private eye who takes cases of people who believe that their significant other has cheated. Only one day he finds a funny thing is about to happen when he receives a report from a Mrs. Mulwray that her husband is cheating. Only later Gittes finds out that this wasn't the real Mrs. Mulwray! And soon upon investigating this claim, he learns that Mr. Mulwray is tied to a dispute over land and water in the L.A. valley, and as was so common in the 1970's this is tied to political corruption and civil servant scandal. More light is shed after Gittes finds the real Mrs. Mulwray(Faye Dunaway) and the discovery of Mr. Mulwray dead only deepens the mystery. Just when the plot seems to be clear the film throws the viewer off again showing that Mrs. Mulwray's father is playing a clear role in this torrid land and water mess as John Huston gives a fine performance as Noah Cross. Mostly 'Chinatown' is a film of secrets, and political corruption with a plot that keeps the viewer guessing, certainly one of the better and darker films of the 1970's. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as always making this a classic because his performance was straight to the point, and Roman Polanski did a fine job directing this it was well adapted from Robert Towne, and one of the memorable scenes of all time is when Polanski's character cuts Jack's nose with a knife! Overall a pretty good detective mystery film.",10,2,4,6 April 2007
Rocketman," He was never ordinary, still a magical bio type of the lift off of a pop superstar, who had plenty of highs and lows.
","Always liked enjoyed and respected the songs of one 'Sir' Elton John as his music was about love, life, and struggle as his words really touched one's inner soul. With this big screen picture called 'Rocketman' it tells the rise and break out of the stardom of one Elton John it's like the film also teases in a fantasy like way with parody that involves certain songs from John. Flashbacks and looking back at his life are the norm thru the film, as his life is heavily focused on. Looking all the way back at his childhood days you the viewer see that it was tough that Elton grew up without his real dad after the split from tough overbearing mommy Sheila(Bryce Dallas Howard) it was clear that Elton needed a father figure.At an early age this little shy boy took interest in piano and 'Elvis' and would later sing and entertain for escape, and one by one this would mold him into a pop rock superstar! Still along the way this man like everyone else had high and low points from addiction with hard drugs and alcohol, plus he had to battle his inner demons and come to terms with his sexuality. I must also say that actor Taron Egerton was great as Elton he really hit all the high notes from the singing, acting, and he captured all of the man's emotions and brilliant madness of the fairy tale ride of life! Excellent wonderful work for certain go see this if you are an Elton John fan, as it shows how a pop legend came about thru struggles and pain, as this 'Rocketman' is still standing!",10,3,5,1 June 2019
A Star Is Born," A love story mixed with pain, addiction, fame, and tragedy.
","Being a film buff I never watched the older takes of 'A Star is Born' however I watched this latest modern spin with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga(who have great on screen chemistry together). The film is a joy as it touches your emotions and grows on you from the love of the two central characters and the pain combined with fame and sorrow make this musical drama(the songs are uplifting)a wonderful watch.Jackson Maine(Bradley Cooper) is a hard living and hard whiskey drinking western rock singer who lives it up entertaining crowd after crowd. Jackson is a man who's got plenty of personal demons besides the bottle as his family friction with only brother Bobby(the great Sam Elliott) weighs on his heart heavy. Things change when Ally(Lady Gaga) captures his heart along the way the two get to know each other in an intimate way as passion becomes love.Still the love is not without struggle and heartache as Ally becomes famous and well known while Jackson's music and personal life both take a downward path with alcoholism as he just can't escape his own dark shadows. It's like you as the viewer could see the tragedy coming all along.Overall entertaining film with fine and beautiful music and the on screen chemistry between Bradley and Gaga is in top notch form, as clearly this is one love drama to see that showcases the rise of fame and stardom, also while showing a grim personal downfall.",8,137,245,6 October 2018
Gravity," Stuck and Lost in Space.
","Just watched the much buzzed about 'Gravity' I must say it's a sprawling space drama of an atmosphere tone. It's not typical science fiction with monsters and creatures still the scenes let a viewer explore the outer world by seeing the scenes of space puts an ever lasting picture in one's mind. The shots and style of camera angles from director Alfonso Cuaron is done in a beautiful way from seeing the two primary characters in orbit to seeing different parts of the space shuttle craft and compartments as they float all thru the picture. Now for a little story background George Clooney plays Matt a veteran astronaut who while up in space has Ryan Stone(Sandra Bullock)a medical engineer on hand who has taken her first voyage into space. And Ryan is a lady that still has a tragic past attached to her as she still remembers her daughter's death. As the film glides thru all of a sudden the space drama gets full when a Russian satellite explodes causing a reaction and showers of debris that comes at the two central characters. Then no ship the two are lost in orbit! Watching the film in 3-D will connect you as the viewer even more adrift thru space, overall 'Gravity' is a decent space drama of character and survival.",7,1,5,5 October 2013
Wind River," Well done murder suspense mystery of drama and sorrow, yet justice arrives in the end when matters are taken into their own hands.
","I for one have always been a fan of murder and mystery suspense movies where you ask who did it and why, and also I like it when the movie takes a twist. Well with this entry 'Wind River' it includes all of those themes and plots that I just mentioned. Though the film may seem a little slow moving it builds up just fine to the revealing twist and explosive action right before a take matters into your own hands kind of justice.Set in the snow and windy cold climate of a Native American reservation a young woman who's found dead leads the whole town and it's people on a search and cry for answers it's quite a bit of sorrow. At the start the charge begins with Cory Lambert(Jeremy Renner)a veteran game tracker who's got a troubled and sorrow type past as he also lost a daughter of his own.With the arrival of Jane(Elizabeth Olsen)a rookie FBI agent the investigation games and trying to find clues of the puzzle begin. And most information is found thru people of the small Indian town and the girl's family members. And twist and surprises are in store before the bloody and violent end that leads to justice. Overall good suspense mystery action thriller that thru the sorrow and pain it still reaches a rightful end to justice.",8,1,5,25 August 2017
The Big Lebowski," An offbeat and funny comedy drama. That's twisted and interesting a cult film that stands on it's own.
","After all these years I finally watched this acclaimed classic from the Coen brothers and I must say 'The Big Lebowski' is a very unique film that holds interest and stands on it's own. The plot is interesting that takes twist and turns making you as the viewer think and that's really what a movie should do as you know that method is a staple of the Coen Brothers yet this film is blended with laughs to make it more enjoyable. Set in L.A. it focuses on the life of a laid back and down to earth common slacker Jeff Lebowski(Jeff Bridges)who's only enjoyment is smoking pot, drinking beer and hanging out with his friends and bowling. The two friends are a crazed Vietnam war veteran(John Goodman) and a lonely loser(Steve Buscemi). All of sudden this trio of bowling buddies will find themselves on an unexpected journey of facing crazy characters and being involved in an apparent kidnapping case that's tied to mistaken identity.So clearly this is a wild goose chase type of film that's unique as some of the scenes are strikingly visual and it's plot keeps you thinking also look for good supporting turns from Juilanne Moore and Phillp Seymour Hoffman. This is a film that will appeal mostly to the hippie culture and older people still it has plenty of laughs and it's creative enough to last in memory as a unique cult art cinema classic. So remember Dude 'The Big Lebowski' is an offbeat film that strikes a unique score any film watcher will find it's plot very creative that's blended well with laughs! And the acting was in fine form as the chemistry of the characters made the film work so clearly this is an underrated classic to remember.",7,0,2,21 June 2009
Citizen Kane," What's the meaning of life? A film that shows depression and sadness showing how one who has it all loses in the end.
","'Citizen Kane' is one film that many think was the best ever made I just recently watched it and I don't think it was the greatest still it's very memorable for it's message and theme of showing how thru life one rises and then falls as having it all is not without problems and drama, and scandal and in the end all is lost while others remember and try to determine how and why one's life went the way it did. And for a film from 1941 it was greatly directed by Orson Welles with the scenes and story being interesting. As it's pretty simple the movie is of the life and times of news paper tycoon and very rich man Charles Kane. Most of the movie is done thru flashback after the death of Charles(AKA 'Rosebud') and it involves the investigative work of reporters trying to find out about Charles's life from political experiences to scandal like that of an affair with a singer and how all of this caused him to have a fall off. Overall wonderful film that shows that life for many is that of a rise and fall and as after one dies many still search for answers and memories.",7,0,2,16 February 2017
Darkest Hour," A showcase of a historical drama that gives informative insight into a legendary figure.
","I for one am a history buff and enjoy movies about real life figures especially men and political figures that were involved in war times and times that impacted history. 'Darkest Hour' is one picture that's very well done and gives fresh and plenty of insight into Winston Churchill(in a blowout performance from Gary Oldman his actions and manners are in top form). As the film's focus is the early days of War War II and how the fate and balance of western Europe hung in the balance.Churchill(Oldman) who's unpopular to many has just been named British prime minister and the balance of power is in question as he and others face the cruel and brutal Hitler. Does a nation choose between war, or peace with liberty and freedom? The film shows many scenes of debate and discussion as plenty of thought and decision making goes into play. Plus Winston is not without his vices as he enjoys to much chain cigar smoking and guzzles many glasses of whiskey it's like he's an alcoholic! Still his mind and determination is sharp and on point for an old overweight man. This man is a champion of the people as his listens to his country first, Winston Churchill was not a man who was afraid to act, or change his mind for the best interest he was a hero. Plus see this film for the performance of Gary Oldman as it's one historical war biography drama not to be missed.",8,1,5,4 January 2018
Monster," A transformation into evil a good look at doom and tragedy.
","'Monster' is for sure one of the most blunt and compelling and provocative and outspoken crime biography movies ever made. Charlize Theron gives her best and very dark transformation work as real life convicted serial killer Aileen Wuornos(in fact Charlize won a best actress Oscar for her portrayal). Wuornos was an interstate highway Florida prostitute who stalked, robbed and did pick up's of men by hitchhiking. Doomed and abused and unloved killing is the only life that Aileen ever knew until she meet Selby Wall(Christina Ricci)a young girl who provided Aileen with a small glimmer of hope and it brought out the other side of Wuornos sexually and that's deep down that she was a bisexual lesbian.Still the blood, pain, and violence was to much to escape as that's the only world that Aileen ever knew as at least seven men had their fate taken by her. As death and the taking of life was the only happiness for this doomed and haunting lady. Overall good crime biography film that stands out due to Charlize Theron's wicked blunt transformation performance.",8,1,1,14 June 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Fun and entertaining joy film that's done in a unique fashion a real action packed bloody treat!
","I must say that director Quentin Tarantino does it again, as if you've watched his films you know he always makes them entertaining by blending them with humor and action. While going over the top with violence and human blood. Well this 40's era comedy fantasy drama 'Inglourious Basterds' is no different as it's a film that some may find to long or overstated or drawn out still it's script and story is interesting to hold a viewers thoughts for the entire time.As one knows Tarantino tells stories in his own unique and assertive ways as here he shows that World War II was won through a combination of luring Germans, to the power of their own cinema which brings them to the prowess of a band of renegade soldiers all supposedly Jews. This band of outcast is lead by Lt. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt)who's a southern country mountain moonshine hillbilly as one can tell by the twang and draw of his accent. Pitt who gives a good turn is mostly overshadowed though by the supporting cast, especially that of Christoph Waltz who as a villain Col. Hans Landa starts the film off with a direct and cut and dry scene as the 'Jew Hunter' as he begins his search in Nazi occupied France which is the films setting thru and thru. And well worth the watch and a good treat is Eli Roth as 'Bear Jew' Sgt. Donny Donowitz who smashes the heads of German soldiers to a bloody pulp.Now that the battle lines have been drawn the film moves along like chapters from a book as many scenes seem like a game where people whether Jewish or German always seem in trouble. As this moves along with it's over the top blood and gore and a lot of reading German script as it's gross yet fun to see the gang scalp German heads. A clever and interesting plot develops to rid the evil Germans out of France. Enter Bridget a German actress who's an undercover spy played by Diane Kruger who lures a bar scene of good and bad guys to face blood. Yet the most climatic plan after this is when French Jew Shosanna who changes identity after her family is slaughtered and opens a new cinema to plot revenge. As now the Germans have fallen to the trap as they love war cinema only they will literally come to a climactic blowout in her French cinema of paradise or should I say German hell! Overall this is a fun thrill good film that's over the top with blood and unique gore that's funny as many scenes tease the audience. As it was interesting to see Quentin's interesting take on how War War II was won. Clearly always he has fun with history as historic villains like Hitler and Goebbels are played as jokes, and the female leads are interesting by ending up doomed and the performances are strong especially Pitt's southern accent, yet the strongest and most magnetic is Waltz's. So overall really this unique fun alerted history film even though full of propaganda can be classified as glorious work. Clearly count it as a feel good film to see.",8,4,13,21 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A good way to make Vader mad! An okay prequel that sets up 'A New Hope' just fine!
","Being a 'Star Wars' fan I had to check out this new film called 'Rogue One' and though nothing great still it entertains and fits into the saga just fine as it leads everything into episode 4 just fine. Set just after episode 3 and just before the happenings of 'A New Hope', this chapter centers around the rebel alliance and a risk type of a move to steal the 'Death Star'. It kind of involves ordinary and common people, combined with warriors and of course rebels and rogues who come together to work as a team! It's all speared by Jyn(Felicity Jones)along with guidance from flight fighter Cassian Andor(Diego Luna)and droid K-2So. Along the way plenty of battles are fought with gunfire and skill. Yet behind it all is a plan and plot to help the rebels overtake the 'Death Star' from the evil empire, overall pretty simple story that entertains and reveals a path and gateway to launch the other chapters of the saga, plus the appearance from 'Lord Vader' was a presence shattering feel of doom and command for any viewer.",6,2,5,23 December 2016
Iron Man 2," Pretty good sequel that's entertaining, explosive and sexy.
",'Iron Man' is not my favorite superhero(that place goes to Batman)nor does he rank ahead of Wonder Women still Tony Stark is an interesting cocky sucker of enough character to watch. As 'Iron Man 2' for a sequel really delivered. As director Jon Favreau once again kept the action rolling with special effects and kick ass action sequences. Once again Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark former weapons mogul turned special agent Iron Man. This time his challenge is a Russian villain named Ivan(Mickey Rourke fresh off his classic performance in 'The Wrestler') who wants to destroy the world with his new chemical and high tech weapons. And Sam Rockwell struts as a money hungry arms dealer.Returning is Gwyneth Paltrow as Tony's girlfriend now company CEO. And to spice up the picture a real treat of eye candy is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha who's sexy as hell! She becomes a new superhero! Really this film is a showcase for cutting edge technology that shows human inventions. And it was nice to see a cameo by Bill O' Reilly too. Overall this picture is a good treat of action and explosive technology. Probably a watch for any comic book fan.,8,36,70,9 May 2010
Argo," Excellent movie that's memorable and historical. The tale of a real fake hidden mission that worked!
","No matter what side of the political side your on you will enjoy this latest political thriller as 'Argo' is an intense and raw suspense filled tale of the real life fake mission that helped free six of the American hostages that were held during Iran in 1979 and 1980. And wow the mission was for them to pose as a fake sci-fi film crew! Many just like me are just now learning of this actual CIA work, but it did happen as it was classified for many years and then declassified and brought to light. And actor and director Ben Affleck does wonderful work in bringing this real life tale to the screen. This is one film that after watching touches your political emotions.Set in 1979 and 1980 during the early part of the Iran hostage crisis it focuses on six American officials who depart the torn embassy and take up secret living at the home of the Canadian ambassador. So just how are these hostages going to be freed well enter the raw and rugged shaggy looking CIA agent Tony Mendez(Ben Affleck) who's plan is that the six will pose as a fake Canadian film crew scouting for a filming location for a low budget B sci-fi look 'Star Wars' ripoff film called 'Argo'. Everything starts to be put in place from the fake names, passports, and new looks to the escape travel routes.Seeing Iran in 1979 and 1980 shows an extreme Muslim world of uncertain and tense feeling as Mendez sees this after he fixed everything up in Hollywood with the help and money backing from a legendary movie producer Lester Siegel(the always good Alan Arkin)and he gets monster movie make up artist the well respected John Chambers(the always folksy John Goodman)to help start up the fake campaign for 'Argo'. And believe it or not this all has approval from CIA boss Jack O' Donnell(Bryan Cranston). As they do it different sometimes the strangest plans work! Along the way from watching 'Argo' you get intense feelings of suspense and political drama this film can relate a lot to the every day world and international political climate it's message shows the world is always involved in power and political struggles fueled by religion, greed and the need to stand alone at the top. I was only one year old in 1979 I still have small little memories by seeing clips of this time, and clearly this excellent historical political picture brought to light and revealed the story behind this troubling time in U.S. history because for me I was to caught up with Kenner's 'Star Wars' action figures! 'Argo' is one historical film that revealed a life changing mission that is now cherished and respected it clearly showed that courage and heart is often in the form of offbeat smarts and odd clever secret missions.",10,3,8,12 October 2012
Last Flag Flying," A film of reflection, memories, and bonding of friendship thru struggles and emotions.
","Finally watched the latest film from Richard Linklater who mostly does works of friendship and family and with this touching drama 'Last Flag Flying' it doesn't let you down. A film that's powerful and bold with a statement of courage showing that honor can be done in a different way and manner.Set in 2003 thirty years after a trio of Vietnam War veterans served all reunite and get together on a different mission and that's the burial of one's son former Navy Corp medic Larry 'The Doc'(Steve Carell), as Doc's son was a young Marine killed in the Iraq war.Yet this burial is different Doc decides instead of a National Cemetery burial the casket will go back by train to his New Hampshire hometown. Along the way help and support is given from the outspoken and against the grain Sal(Bryan Cranston) and the straight and loving Rev. Richard(Laurence Fishburne).Along the way this journey produces memories, reflection, and rediscovered love and thru it all these traits continue to shape their lives with bravery and courage. Overall this is a well done film of standing up and being brave with courage and emotion.",9,0,1,5 July 2018
Public Enemies," Well done telling of a historic crime figure. It entertains and holds interest with good support by blasts and blazing gunfire.
","Michael Mann who is one of the best film directors around as by evidenced with his crime genre films, really scores big here with his latest as 'Public Enemies' is an informative and historical blasting and blazing gunfire thrill ride from start to finish. This film is blended with enough action and your traditional bad guy against good theme to make it a must see for any film fan and the acting and chemistry between the characters which features some of the best working in film today like Depp, Cotillard and Bale make it even much more of a treat.Set in the 1930's Midwest during the great depression the film starts off rather heavy as criminal John Dillinger(played wonderful by Johny Depp)burst out of an Indiana jail and right away becomes a dangerous and brazen bank robber of the 1930's depression era as one by one he's robbing banks and breaking out of jails. This sparks the justice system and federal law enforcement to create new methods and ways to fight crime as their jurisdiction will reach from state to state and a new most wanted list is created from the agency head J. Edgar Hoover. You guessed it the most wanted enemy number one is John Dillinger. Now enter some drama and conflict as the film was good to show during the bureau's early days not all was agreed on in legal methods and searches plus even arranging chase teams were debated. All this would come from hotshot and by the book special agent Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale)who would come to final terms with Dillinger in Chicago in 1934.As you see from bank robbery to bank robbery including jail escapes John Dillinger is cool, calm, calculated, and cocky the movie shows him as such an interesting character which is helped by Depp's elegant and effortlessly cut performance. As many of these gunfires scenes are so well liked for the way Mann shot them still thru it all this film celebrates the criminal as a pop culture phenomenon for the way it shows him in many scenes. Along the way as with any bad guy Dillinger meets a love interest really the wild card of the film that being a lady named Billie(Marion Cotillard who's sexy)and they romance along the chase path when not busy taking money yet it still leads to unexpected crazy love.Really this is a measured film that entertains in such a traditional way of the classic good guy against bad guy with plenty of support from blazing gunfire it's such a traditional feel good film. As the setting of the 1930's and it's actual taking of place helps. Still the way director Mann made this crime drama makes it an interesting watch not only is it a fun action drama to watch it's a good historical film that shows the early FBI roots and it profiles one of the first and earliest criminals the country ever had. You as a viewer really would cheer for the Dillinger character as it showcases and shows him in such a stylish way. Seriously 'Public Enemies' is one of the better action crime dramas that's been made in a long time a real winner due to it's direction and for the fact that it showed a lot of historical information to many that didn't know. And most of all Johhnny floats and sails above everyone with his memorable and very good performance as a legendary American criminal figure.",8,3,4,4 July 2009
The Danish Girl," Courage and finding truth feeling good about really becoming one's self.

The Girl Next Door," A hormone driven movie that's better and different, and it's carried by the cute and sexy Elisha Cuthbert.
","'The Girl Next Door' is well done and has all the elements of your typical hormone teen flick, yet it's a little different than most, by having characters discover their true feelings and finding love in the most unexpected way. Emile Hirsch stars as Matthew Kidman a high school senior who's a brain and uptight never having any fun, until one day when he discovers his new next door neighbor(Elisha Cuthbert) who just happens to be hot so he tries to give her a try! The opening scene when Matthew sees her thru the open window next door is just great, oh that backside of Elisha! Well upon meeting and finding her name as Danielle they begin to talk, hang out and become friends, only Matthew soon discovers that Danielle is an ex porn star now his world and culture starts to spin out of control! True this film is your typical hormone driven sex flick with plenty of teen pranks, and many sexy scenes and quotes, yet the development of a loving and caring relationship forms between the two central characters. Many of the movies things are crazy but yet they help bring both Matthew and Danielle to love like the Las Vegas porn convention and the prom night sex education video! I must say the performance of Elisha Cuthbert is fabulous she's so cute and sexy and many scenes of her in this film were so hot! Especially the window and pool scenes, and the hotel clothing take off when she sported that sexy red bra and panties! Elisha really carried this film she's really a beautiful and sexy star. Finally 'The Girl Next Door' shows and teaches a viewer that love can be found for anyone no matter how different the backgrounds and that success and happiness can be obtained in the craziest ways.",7,0,0,13 May 2007
Ted," Cute, clever, adorable and brash fun fairy tale comedy!
","Everyone knows when you enter the world of Seth MacFarlane that it's fun and his work is a joy to watch. As his concepts bring out the kid in you as his fairy tales remind you of your childhood he likes to showcase that dreams do come true! With this work rightfully titled 'Ted' it shows that a fairy tale film can be a heck of a lot of fun especially when it's blended with funny brash and outspoken talk, and in the meantime it tells a touching story of love and friendship!

Knives Out," Guessing game of clues of who did it? Cat and mouse suspense drama with all star cast!
","'Knives Out' is for sure one clever and hide the stab whodunit, as the on screen talent and chemistry between the players is plenty to take in. While underneath it all lies and rep tape unfolds as a murder mystery tries to hide. Christopher Plummer is the family patriarch and most famous novelist of mystery and suspense and it's crazy when his 85th birthday party becomes a crime scene of it's own. His assorted offspring which consist of kids and in laws(to name a few Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, and Toni Collette) and these folks start to squabble and dodge the truth.Enter detective Blanc(Daniel Craig) who stalks the case in his own manner as the film twists and turns and reveals things you as the viewer don't see coming, it's like the film is just a tweak of classic murder mysteries as the Drysdale group is so combative and eccentric(also look for a stand alone performance from Ana de Armas) that this picture puts plenty on the viewers plate as many entertaining themes are present.",8,6,13,9 December 2019
The Irishman," Long in depth crime drama that's old style looking at a tense mob life thru the years.
","You should know anytime you have legends Scorsese, Pacino, and De Niro working together plus when you add Joe Pesci you know you have an A plus movie! Plus this film is long and much detail as it looks at the life and times of mobsters during three decades. The story spans from the 1940's to the supposed 1975 disappearance of Hoffa. First starting with the early days of Frank Sheeran(Robert De Niro) being a union truck delivery driver that would transform into him becoming a brutal mob hit man. All of this begins when Frank becomes friends with Mr. Bufalino(Joe Pesci). Much and most of the film is told thru flashback and Frank's point of view.Along the way Frank is soon introduced to the powerful Jimmy Hoffa(Al Pacino) and the underworld of backroom dealings and killings are the norm all while being tied to business, money, greed, and politics as the tension with the Kennedy's is highlighted and showcased. As usual plenty of blood, and changes await most of the cronies in the form of either death or jail time! Also look for good supporting turns from Bobby Cannavale and Anna Paquin.As the film progresses you see regret as Sheeran goes into old age and I must say the acting and chemistry was top notch and in all pro form from all involved it's very detail as the scenes and words are near flawless really this film is a masterpiece maybe somewhat of a send off for all of the legends involved. 'The Irishman' is an epic journey the film is certainly true mobster style in a vintage old throwback way as it shows the past of true gangsters.",10,2,10,30 November 2019
127 Hours," Harrowing film. Great visuals a great reflection of life when stuck between a rock and a hard place.
","Finally saw '127 Hours' and I must say terrific film a tribute to the human soul and right to life. After watching this film you will never again take anything in life for granted even the small stuff like food, water, and everything else from sharing time with people will be that much more important to you. This film is also a film of reflection to make one think about mistakes, choices, and it gives one the will and determination to live.Director Danny Boyle who's always at the top of his game always makes pictures that are tough yet usually the human soul and spirit prevails('Slumdog Millionaire')this picture even though harrowing and a struggle wins in the end. As it's isolated journey helps you as a viewer appreciate in the end everything about life. Many of the visuals(aside from the bloody arm amputation scene)are wonderfully done as the camera work of angles of the canyons are top notch. And themes of drama, emotion, uncertainty, loss and will to survive make it such a compelling film.Based on a real life true story of hiker and rock climber Aron Ralston(in a career best performance from Jack of all trades James Franco)it's 2003 and Aron an adventure and loner type decides to take a weekend trip to Moab, Utah for some climbing and sight seeing of some beautiful and wonderful canyons. Upon arrival he meets two cute gals Kristi(Kate Mara)and Megan(Amber Tamblyn)and after having a little fun and taking a dip in a nearby lake stream of water, it's back to more canyon climbing for Aron. Only a big fall of uncertainty and isolation takes place with a slip all of a sudden Ralston takes a fall between a narrow canyon and to complicate matters a giant boulder has fallen trapping and pinning him in.From then on the film becomes a journey of self discovery as the flashbacks and scenes of foreshadowing tell Aron a lot about life he thinks about his past and to help keep him alive and for motivation good thoughts and images of family, friends, and intimate thoughts of Kristi and Megan help keep him going another day. As being trapped for five days Aron learns to appreciate much even the small things like air and water. And perhaps god sent are the premonitions of things to come as that only gives him more motivation to live. As being stuck between a rock and a hard place and the fact that no one knows calls for desperate measures in desperate times. The scene is gross and somewhat disturbing it shows just what someone will do just so they can survive.'127 Hours' is a film that proves never take anything for granted as in an unexpected and unplanned time of survival isolation one can learn to appreciate everything even the small things like water and air. Things happen for a reason as maybe this was for Aron to look at his life this film is a great one of reflection and having the will to live it's certainly one picture to be respected as you will feel touched and moved it's a human triumph of the soul and spirit.",8,0,2,29 January 2011
Batman Returns," Equally good and almost superior to Burton's 1989 original. And it's also dark and gloomy in it's own way.
",1992's 'Batman Returns' was Tim Burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. Gotham City again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. It was also clever to see how Burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman Max Shreck(Christopher Walken)and the plan to make the 'Penguin'(Danny DeVito) mayor of Gotham! Anyway Keaton again returns as 'Batman'/Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle only Ms. Kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous 'Catwoman'(Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. Really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to Tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. The performance from Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played 'The Catwoman' any better and Devito was perfect as the 'Penguin' his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. 'Batman Returns' is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive.,9,6,12,12 July 2008
Superbad," A wild night and laid back feel good teen film!
","'Superbad' is one flick as you watch you feel the far out and crazy fun as it's a typical teen comedy that features the themes of fitting in with having sex, getting girls and having a party in high school before a college send off. The movie has two high school seniors Seth(the funny Jonah Hill) and Evan(Michael Cera) who go thru these same things mentioned in the meantime they having a ball doing it as the party and alcohol is so fun it's like a wild night something similar to 'Porky's' or 'Animal House'! Also of note is an early and young role with Bill Hader('HBO's' 'Barry') as Officer Slater a cool laid back cop! Overall good teen film to watch for feel good fun.",6,0,1,13 July 2019
Creed," A sentimental tale and a journey of passing the torch of love and courage for a victory of life and hard knocks!
","Always been a fan of the 'Rocky' movies as Stallone always does so good with them, as each are action paced and packed with ring action all while telling a story of life, heart, and courage. This latest installment called 'Creed' picks up and follows the tale and journey in a fast paced and quick moving way of one young up and coming Adonis Johnson(Michael B. Jordan) later to be known as simply 'Creed' as this young man guy is the son of former Philadelphia boxing legend and heavyweight champ and 'Rocky' friend Apollo Creed. Starting with Adonis getting out of jail and reform school on the west coast he decides to moving back home on the east coast to Philadelphia with mother and you guested it he wants to follow in the footsteps of dad and be a fighter. Soon he meets 'Rocky' in a restaurant and talks about being trained in the light heavyweight ranks. Slowly but surely Balboa gives in as Adonis is hot headed stubborn and with a high temper. Thru the ranks of hard knocks and life, Adonis learns about love, friendship, and commitment to people and Balboa himself. As 'Rocky' reveals some bad news to Adonis before his big fight. Again this 'Rocky' picture proves it's not if you win or lose but how you play the game and how hard you fight. It's a clear picture of faith and a tribute to courage and discovery of new life and a passing of the torch to the next and new generation of fists and hard knocks.",8,2,6,30 November 2015
Brokeback Mountain," Unpredictable and uncommon love that last the times, and remains even when it ends in tragedy.
","This for sure is not your typical cowboys story as it may seem when it starts out, 'Brokeback Mountain' is something much more special. Starting out in 1963 in rural Wyoming a simple summer friendship is formed by two innocent cowboys by the name of Ennis Del Mar(Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist(Jake Gyllenhaal) only this summer encounter will turn into a lifelong connection of love and friendship. After the summer course of work ends, both return back to their old grounds and each begin new directions. Jack returns to Texas to enjoy the life of a rodeo cowboy and falls in love and marries a sexy and wealthy female(Anne Hathaway) and he begins a family. Ennis stays in Wyoming and marries his old school love(Michelle Williams) and a family of children begins right away, and Ennis has to continue to work hard as a ranch hand. Ennis then four years into his normal world receives a postcard, then him and Jack revisit and again start to have wonderful encounters every so often at Brokeback, this finally costs Ennis his wife. Anyway this strong bond continues year after year as each man goes along with the changes joys and heartbreaks so commonly associated with everyday life. When tragedy strikes and Ennis finds out about the fate of Jack, the emotional love lasts and you get an emotional feel at the tribute that Ennis gives to Jack at the end. I must say great movie and well done especially good acting from Ledger and Gyllenhaal who make both Ennis and Jack such likable characters that you feel emotions for and you feel their hurt. Also way to go for director Ang Lee for having the courage to take on the topic of gay cowboy love, especially the way he directed in the setting of a conservative Wyoming in the 1960's. Lee really proved that love is possible for anyone and that any human being can love another human being no matter who they are.",10,21,23,12 February 2007
About Time," Wow it would be nice to have powers to go back in time to change circumstance, and life and love. Anyway nice eye candy with Rachel McAdams!
","'About Time' is one film that when you watch you see it as a sci-fi type fairy tale with themes of love and living happily ever after, yet underneath it all the picture has much more. Though it may be a little short on reality with the theme of traveling back in time still enough love, life and passion with chance and circumstance is present to make the film a real winner. And it's spice and sugar is just nice with some sexy scenes of Rachel McAdams wearing very sexy multi colored bras!

And this special power can be reached by simply going away in a little room and closing both fist tight and wishing and picturing to go back in time!

And thru this time travel Tim is able to change his biggest shortfall and that's finding love.

Spotlight," An interesting and compelling investigative drama that uncovers a scandal of abuse and power that involves moral and hierarchy authority!
","'Spotlight' so far for this year does hold up as one of the most powerful and stronger movies of this year. It's supported and held together by an all-star and all pro cast of film veterans like Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and John Slattery. The film is based on the true and real life story of the Boston Globe's investigation into the uncovering of the massive scandal of the cover- up that the local catholic Archdiocese did within the city. And this would involve the abuse and sexual molestation of mostly young boys. As one by one older men start to remember and recount the gone by years that they were prey and taken advantage of by high ranking religious figures of the church as it's revealing to see how the young, innocent, and lonely are hit so hard. Upon the the investigation by the newspaper team it is found how the cover-up was at all levels from not only just the church but in the form of the legal system and local and federal government as the cases were often kept quite or thrown out or settled out of court. Along the way the team does draining work of digging for information and asking questions of the high powered in the city as Robby(Michael Keaton)the lead hunter and Sacha(Rachel McAdams)are the tag team of reporters that gather the most revealing information. Overall this picture is informative and investigative as it does shed light on scandal and corruption showing that the powerful must be held accountable and it proves that religious leaders are often a massive greed scandal and a work of moral decay as the hierarchy loves to abuse their power and authority. Overall 'Spotlight' is a real eye opening film that searches and finds answers as it's a showcase of accountability proving that light must be shined on those in power.",8,3,7,24 November 2015
Aquaman," Not yours or your granfather's 'Aquaman' yet D.C.'s long time whipping boy gets some big screen respect!
","For years the man of the high seas has been over looked and not respected always trailing and falling far behind 'D.C.'s' big boys of 'Superman', 'Batman' and even 'Wonder Woman'. Finally a big screen film of 'Aquaman', and much different from my memory of fish man as with Jason Momoa's take this superhero looks more like a heavy metal weight lifting super star! And the film is filled with plenty of action scenes and the 'CGI' and special effects are plenty. Still aside from all of the big stuff it's a good origin story of how his parents meet and how 'Aquaman' comes about. And it's a journey of sibling conflict and war under sea as the kingdom and water country of Atlantis is at risk and along the way Mera(Amber Heard) gives support as King Orm is a big threat to underwater peace. Thru it all Aqua's mom Atlanna(Nicole Kidman) is an underwater spirit that's still present for things to stay afloat. Overall pretty good take and work from 'D.C.' as the man of the sea finally gets movie exposure.",8,4,8,29 December 2018

Juno," Eggo your pregnant! Witty and sassy and intelligent teen flick, in which a girl learns the facts of life to become happy!
","It appears once again that FOX Searchlight pictures has found another winner in this indie as you may be like me and consider it similar to 'Little Miss Sunshine' for the fact of it's central character is again a sassy and adorable female, yet both films are similar with coming of age tales of life. 'Juno' is well written and very funny and most of the lines said from Ellen Page's Juno character are very witty and sassy with an intelligence that's so uncommon from a teenage girl. 'Juno' also proves that life has it's growing pains with unexpected bumps and curves happen along the way before love and happiness is realized.Ellen Page is fantastic in her performance of teenage girl Juno MacGuff a small town Minnesota girl who's a rock n' roll fan and slurp drinker who's equipped with a sharp and witty vocabulary that's bright and sassy, Juno always is a lighting rod of intelligence!

'Juno' is an excellent film even though it's a teen drama flick it's touching and it's about giving and taking and learning to grow up. The film also has a common everyday feel to it making it good. Plus the performance from Ellen Page is very intelligent, sassy, smart and over the top she's a real winner with a bright future. Also TV veterans J.K.

Concussion," Tell the truth! A provocative and compelling drama that discovers a medical problem and it asks how will the biggest sports corporation contend with it?
","If anyone is a die hard NFL fan like me and follows the game and the sports world and the news, you know that over the years the league has been facing the problem of how to deal with player concussions and how to protect them better, and what to do when the players retire. The film 'Concussion' deals with that on going drama just fine as it follows the research and work of one real life pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu(played in a tough strong performance manner from Will Smith). Set in Pittsburgh after the deaths of several star former Steeler players most notable that being hall of fame center Mike Webster(in a gritty performance from David Morse)who due to many hits to the head developed all kinds of problems like hearing voices, and loss of reality as he even had to live away from his family taking shelter in his own truck before falling to suicide by a head gunshot wound. The film is somewhat sad and emotional as you see the broken down players and hear the stories of their problems and passing. Dr. Omalu is one pathologist who's eager and willing to find out more and why and what drove these former players to young deaths by suicide, so thru his work he finds brain damage in these former players who suffered concussions and all would develop a new disease CTE. At first his medical news is doubted by others doctor's(played well by Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks)yet they are slowly broken in to believe yet the challenge to face the NFL with the news is the toughest, as the film states you are going to war with a corporation that owns a day of the week even over the church and of course that's Sunday as the NFL has risen to sports entertainment that's at the top of the mountain. Finally Dr. Omalu's voice and discovery does get the league's attention and many former players and current ones take the issue to capital hill and congress. Overall 'Concussion' is one film that's an emotional drama of discovery and it searches for the truth wanting answers to a new NFL problem that has expanded.",9,30,48,27 December 2015

Midnight in Paris," A man's wish and dreams of a new setting, leads to an illusion of a past era that shows his current future wasn't meant to be.
","I'm not the greatest Woody Allen fan in the world, yet I must say with his latest 'Midnight in Paris' it's offbeat, funny and strange enough to prove life can be interesting and misleading. It's showcase of wanting to dream and the wish for a change can lead to an illusion to prove that your current fate wasn't meant to be! Also a nice eye candy treat is the work and performance from the sexy Rachel McAdams(one of the big screens most enjoyable pleasures to watch). As with typical Allen he keeps it offbeat and funny, he proves that life, love and relationships are complex, and most of all fate is unexpected and life can start anew.Set in the capital of France the to be married young couple Gil(Owen Wilson)and Inez(in a sexy performance by the hot and cute Rachel McAdams)have came along with Inez's parents to adventure the city and take the French culture. And one by one the arts and buildings, museums, galleries, and fine wine eateries are a delight. Yet as Inez aside from being a hot and sexy lady enjoys the material side of France, her love Gil an author falls in love with the setting he wants to live in France! He doesn't want the California rich sun life that Inez does.So one night while strolling the city Gil has an illusion he's taken back to 1920's France! It's with this strange meeting and with many more trips back in time he sees France is more and more meant for him and the love thing with Inez just wasn't meant to be. Overall a film of escapism and it proves dreams and illusions can wake you up to your present world showing that past history can lead you to a new setting and a chance to a new start of life and possible love.",7,3,6,10 June 2011
Milk," Compelling, Interesting, Educational and excellent docudrama in which Sean Penn is fantastic you will cheer for him!
","Just recently saw this film, and I can certainly see why many are calling 'Milk' one of the best films of 2008. At the end you will stand and cheer due to the performance given by Sean Penn as Harvey Milk who was the first openly gay elected politician to serve in this country. No matter what your political stance is, or no matter what your take is on social and moral issues of our time like homosexuality this masterpiece of a docudrama is moving and touching for the way it shows how history was changed somewhat by one Harvey Milk. Director Gus Van Sant one who is excellent at doing docudramas intersects this film along just fine by showing Milk's relationships with lovers(played by James Franco and Diego Luna)also well displayed is Milk's offbeat sense of humor and his uncanny ability to attract followers all which tie in well with what he was able to accomplish in California's era of a gay ballot proposition proposal.Anyway call him unifier, politician, fighter, icon, inspiration, or hero. Harvey Milk and his life changed history and his courage changed lives. This film to me a good historical docudrama charts mostly the last eight years of Harvey's life starting with Milk in New York City at the age of 40, and clearly Harvey feels he hasn't done a thing in his life so looking for more purpose along with his lover they relocate to San Francisco, California. Here they open up a small business shop called Castro Camera in the heart of a working class place that will soon become a stomping ground for gay people from all around the country. This set in the mid 70's a time when many cities especially San Francisco were experiencing big social movements and outcries from gays. And with this message and the city of San Fran empowering him Milk finally surprises everyone and becomes an outspoken agent for change and notice for all homosexuals by seeking equal rights and opportunities for them all. As the film shows it was a struggle too as this was a time when violence against gays was openly accepted. So in a challenging and compelling twist Milk decides to take a swim into the murky and wavy waters of us guessed it politics.After three unsuccessful attempts at his run for a San Franciso supervisor seat on his fourth run in 1977 Harvey was finally elected to the board of supervisors which was helped out by the newly rezoned district 5. And Milk serves well by fighting for citywide ordinances that protect people from being fired because of their sexual preferences. Yet as shown in the film by real live news reel footage on a nationwide level(good show of realism by Van Sant)Milk knows he's in for a real battle from Christian conservatives and right wing republicans. To add to the drama of the film the political agenda of Harvey is threatened by a newly elected supervisor Dan White(Josh Brolin who is super he always gives us our moneys worth)this all leads to a dangerous and tragically unexpected end for Milk in 1978.Really what more can I say clearly 'Milk' is one of the best docudramas ever made it's a stirring take on the political process that took an outspoken social stand not only for gays, but for Americans that it urges them to get involved and make things happen. Overall great time period piece a fine historical docudrama with a super direction from Van Sant and the supporting performances from Brolin, Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and James Franco are great. Most of all Sean Penn is in fantastic form as Harvey Milk his performance is powerful maybe one of the best in film history, he's one of the best actors around Sean gets so involved with his roles. So no matter if your liberal or conservative you will stand up and cheer when you see 'Milk' an excellent film one of 2008's best.",10,4,9,20 December 2008
The Hateful Eight," A long drawn out blood western, mixed with race and politics and themes of search and find.
","'The Hateful Eight' is certainly not a bad movie, yet really for me it wasn't a good one either as it's long drawn out style of conversations between character is a little to long and made me feel tired. If you know anything about Quentin Tarantino you know that the director likes to make long films and his themes often mix race and politics and most of the characters are on search and find missions that usually end in a blood type destroy mode for all involved. And that's a pretty good sum up for rightfully Quentin's 8th film called 'The Hateful Eight'. This film can be a tribute somewhat to the old style B western films of the 1970's and it's a tease of action and adventure. Set in a snow covered Wyoming after the civil war this tale involves the travels of a bounty hunter(played well by Kurt Russell)who in his wagon carries a beat up and wild female prisoner(played strong by Jennifer Jason Leigh). Upon the journey they encounter a former Union officer(played to crazy form by Samuel L. Jackson)who wants to cut a deal yet all in involved have the intentions of blood, guns, and mayhem. Rounding out the cast in supporting form is Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Demian Bichir. While most fans of Tarantino will like it and western B film fans might have a joy still to me it's not Quentin's best it's much of a tease of dark blood humor as I was asking for more still it's an okay film to see.",8,4,21,1 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," I did my best and got an 8! Well done look at real life Greek like tradegy that's a life full of hard knocks with a blunt and brash lady who came off the train tracks!
","Everyone remembers the drama of around 1993 and 1994 when the sports and ice skating world was turned upside down by an attack scandal featuring Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. It rocked pop culture and became tabloid headlines. And this latest biography type picture called 'I Tonya' captures those moments just perfect as the acting and direction is just perfect as the film is told from the perspective of all involved thru interviews and flashback like form.The movie follows the life of one hard luck woman as from the start you see that Tonya Harding(in a fine performance from Margot Robbie) is a doomed lady who's abused both mentally and verbally and beat on from those most close to her. Tonya's only comfort is the cold ice that she skates on underneath and it's her want and desire to be the best on the ice that moves her, even though the odds are stacked against her.This picture is also a showcase on the life of hard knocks and abuse as a key contributor is Tonya's hard and tough as stone wicked witch of a mother LaVona Golden(in the best performance ever from veteran actress Allison Janney) who helps throw her daughter into a life of negative ways and trailer park trash type living. And upon marriage to a guy named Sebastian, Tonya's life doesn't improve as the beatings and punches and bruises are still given to her. And it's the husband who plays a key role in the plot to go after and mess with Nancy.Overall really a pretty good movie that's blunt, brash, and outspoken for the way how it shows that the life of a woman came more and more off the train track. It proves for some that life is cruel and brutal and it took me back in time to the early to mid 90's when this drama was headline news!",8,2,3,21 January 2018
Molly's Game," Jessica shines in this wild modern morality tale of high stakes and high rolling game of luck and chance!
","'Molly's Game' is based on the true real life tale of one Molly Bloom(Jessica Chastain in one of her most blunt and provocative roles) a former Olympic type skier who was a lot on her plate to choose from. Her life is full of dice and the cards she picks is to run underground poker games out in L.A. instead of going to law school.And these games are not just for your average Joe they feature tournaments and high stakes games between movie stars, sports figures, and you guessed it the mob also has their piece of the pie on the plate. The film is moved along by it's crafty dialogue and glitter and high class shots of Molly dressed fitted to kill in her best and most sexy looking outfits.The film is really a showcase of an exciting underworld that's ran by a determined and strong female in Molly Bloom who has hard edge intelligence and stretched like ethics. It's message is life is a gamble and chance and after rolling high it's almost always a loss.",7,1,5,9 January 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A classic legendary western tale of two criminals that works due to the chemistry of the leads and it teases.
","1969's 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is clearly a classic western as it does a pretty good job of the retelling of the two legendary bank robbing western criminal outlaws. And the film is done in a way that pleased most viewers even though the western genre is not everyone's cup of tea, still the action and gunfire is traditional enough to make any old time viewer feel at home and have a classic feel. Yet as you watch much of the film from the robberies, hold ups and getaways and even the acting you will feel a tease as I for one feel this film is a big tease of chase and go that spotlights it being fun to be on the run as a criminal. Anyway still the acting and chemistry is what makes the film as the two leads who in 1969 were clearly just getting in their prime are wonderful as Paul Newman is wise and bright as the old criminal mastermind Butch Cassidy and the young and shining Robert Redford is in fine form as the up and coming outlaw Sundance. And Katherine Ross gives a good supporting turn as the shared love squeeze of both outlaws. Overall the film is a feel good journey of on the run getaway after getaway journey as in it's time in 1969 was a defining film for it's time period. Yet it's stood to be a classic due to the teasing style of outlaw fun and the chemistry and classy performances of two legends like Redford and Newman made it stand the test of film history time.",6,1,2,6 June 2009

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," An excellent way to end the saga. It's full of adventure and it puts closure on the dark side.
","'Return of the Jedi' in 1983 was a great way to end the 'Star Wars' saga the film was a blast as the Rebels and Jedi Knight(Luke) finally won the civil war against Lord Vader and the evil empire. From the start this film begins with action and drama as Skywalker returns to his old stomping grounds his home of Tatooine, but a special mission in plans that's the rescue of Han Solo from the slimy Jabba the Hutt. Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang are along side Luke for the journey that after the defeat of Jabba they land on the forest moon of Endor, it's here that Lucas introduced us to furry little creatures we loved that's the Ewoks! The Ewoks join up with the rebels to fight the empire, though Luke must handle his own business against Vader and the evil that is tempted upon him. The showdown between Luke and Vader is classic as it's over before the death of evil a final sad good bye is said, and Luke gets to see his father without the mask. The torch has finally been passed and the rebels are free and Luke the Jedi Knight rules superior. Really again a super film from Lucas with drama, and action and excitement from start to finish he picked a good way to end the saga. We will always remember George's creations, his characters, plots, and the musical scores of John Williams will never leave your mind, and final thanks to Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill who all were magnificent in all three legendary classics.",10,0,1,2 June 2007
Knocked Up," Great movie. Funny, sexy, and raunchy. Judd Apatow again scores big by pushing the limits.
","I must say 'Knocked Up' is great! It's very funny, sexy, and just great a movie that's a current pop culture gem. Again writer,and director Judd Apatow scores big just like he did with 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', this tale just might be a little more sentimental since it involves childbirth. The script he does is very raunchy and funny with plenty of wise jokes and foul language to keep you amused while an uncommon couple grow during change. You have a loser and porn loving movie and internet slob named Ben(Seth Rogen)who does plenty of pot smoking and childish things, but finally he gets a break when he meets a young and beautiful career-girl named Alison(Katherine Heigl) who's a studio worker at E! News and she finally gets a hosting gig due to her looks and beauty. Upon getting together at the bar one night as so common a one night stand happens! Upon returning to her home which Alison shares with her sister Debbie(Leslie Mann) and her husband Pete(Paul Rudd) she finds out eventually she's knocked up! The news is delivered and both are at first unhappy, but both Ben and Alison decide that they will work together and have the baby and raise it! During the course Apatow fills it with plenty of crude and foul language and raunchy scenes of sex(the two most memorable are the dog style bed scene and the showing of the vagina before birth!) And upon seeing Ben's friends a viewer can feel that they are socially challenged losers, yet with the skin and raunchy scenes Judd did it gives great appeal to hormone driven males. Still if you as a viewer can overlook all of the foul and nagging crudeness underneath you can see this film is a nice fairy tale and storybook love story for both Ben and Alison. For one Ben learns to grow up and learn love and respect the responsibility of a new life. Alison sees life for a change and learns that people are who they are in life just like Ben is and she sees love is possible and can happen between two opposites of their kind. The lines are sharp too with a good take on current pop culture, that helps the viewer find some fresh air as it serves up the start of a new life and brings happiness to a couple of different backgrounds. Overall 'Knocked Up' is a real winner that's blended well with elements we all like and they make us happy, it proves again that Judd Apatow knows how to reach an audience's emotions and pleasures. Final note it's clear too that Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen are rising stars to be respected look for both to be around some more.",9,8,17,1 June 2007
Begin Again," An odd couple make beautiful music together by going a different path their own way!
","'Begin Again' is one of those heart feel type movies that after you watch you will feel refreshed and uplifted. True it's a drama that blends emotion and starting over in life when your down in the dumps, but hey a lot of people have had to do that at some point or the other. Set in New York city it follows the life of Dan(Mark Ruffalo) who's an alcoholic and a washed up past his prime music executive. And Dan has plenty of problems he's divorced from his wife Miriam(Catherine Keener)and even though he has a daughter he sees this little miss Violet(the up and coming Hailee Steinfeld)is a head strong and easy sexy colored bra wearing young lady who likes to march to her own beat. Anyway by a chance encounter Dan meets Gretta(Keira Knightley)who's a young singer who's going thru a struggle after her now famous boyfriend has left her to sing on the big stage. Soon it's evident that Dan sees talent in Gretta and one by one beautiful music is made together the tunes are different and maybe low key yet it strikes a winning note thru emotion and love. Overall this film isn't about a musical score it's about starting over in life with the right tune thru different notes a different voice and different playing instruments.",8,1,3,23 July 2014
Alien," A sci-fi classic that has suspense and drama it entertains a cult gem long before the days of special effects and CGI.
","Long before the days of CGI and high tech special effects this film 1979's 'Alien' entertained in a much different way. As most of the scenes were without special effects it was more gore and it's moments leading up to creature sightings was filled with suspense as the space crew never knew what was around the next corner.The film centered around a spaceship crew Nostromo who upon trying to once again reach earth start to investigate a discovered transmission from a desolate planet and it turns out to be horrifying. A new and gross life form is present and this likes to breed within human host. Now the suspense and drama unfolds as the entire crew must fight for their survival, but that must be for mankind also.Sigourney Weaver is fine in one of early roles as Ripley an iron and high strong determined lady who turns out to be the hero of the space crew by conquering the 'Alien'. Over this is a cult sci-fi classic to be respected as it might seem campy in today's world of CGI and high tech special effects it's suspense and drama still holds up.",7,0,1,9 October 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Well done dark humor film that's carried by bloody graphics and music. Thumbs up for one of the masters of skewing(Tim Burton).
","Again one of the masters of dark graphics and sharp edged humor Tim Burton has scored again with his latest 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'. Crafted brilliant for the way it appeals to a viewer from everything from the dark sets and the graphic special effects really skew one's view of the world. To top it off this was at one time a stage play in London, and the music and singing during the film makes it seem about as real as Broadway could be. Burton once again delivers in his zany and creepy ways by showing the crazy and odd shaped makeup faces of his characters. And the bloody scenes and use of a lot of red show that Tim is really paying homage to old classic horror films.The story theme is really revenge based set in London on a street called Fleet Street. Sweeney Todd(Johnny Depp) returns after being sent away wrongly to find the town has been turned upside down as he's lost his old love and he still sees the same people of royal power in charge. Yet help is provided along the way upon his meeting of the strange but wicked beautiful Mrs. Lovett(Helena Bonham Carter)as a new idea springs to mind that Sweeney will be the town's new barber. The plan is to bring revenge on the entire town as he will give haircuts and shaves that will be straight, sharp, and a cut above the rest! The performances of the cast is good, yet Johnny Depp's stands out as a real showcase for talent as displayed by his vocal talents of singing in this dark musical. 'Sweeny Todd' is well done in a dark and bloody humorous way that it will win your heart over with a vengeance because it just skews your world and imagination so well.",6,0,2,23 April 2008
Horrible Bosses," A title that rings true for many of us!, yet it would be nice to have a wild and funny crazy sexy time just like these disgruntled workers did!
","'Horrible Bosses' so far this year has to rank as one of the better films I've viewed not only because of the star power and cast chemistry, and along with funny and laugh out loud scenes of crazy words and plots, and you add the sexy tease scenes of Jennifer Aniston make it an A plus film. It's the theme of having a horrible boss that I and many others can relate to! Like the characters in this film many of us would even go as far as a plan to kill our boss. It's a fact stress and problems come from work mostly from those in charge and the ones that work over us. It's typical you know the boss is arrogant a prick and cold and uncaring just wanting to work you to death. Then in this comedy we see and wish we could have fun with a plan to conspire like three workers did! Set in sunny and beautiful California it involves three single guys all friends who work for horrible bosses. Nick Hendricks(a nice big screen return from Jason Bateman)is a hard working office systems man who's always dogged and treated badly by his prick and cock arrogant boss Dave Harken(good performance from Kevin Spacey). Nick's not getting a raise or even a promotion! And Kurt Buckman(Jason Sudeikis)is stuck in a tough and dead end job for a chemical trash company with the throne now being steered by party boy, hooker chaser and coke sniffer Mr. Pellit(Colin Farrell). And most interesting is the case of Dale(the funny Charlie Day) a dental assistant who's got a hot and sexy cougar boss in the form of Dr. Julia Harris(in one of the more sexy roles that Jennifer Aniston has had in a long time!)who's always a hot distraction at the dental chair for Dale and that's even while they work on patients! Some of the foul mouth and sexual teases are just downright nasty! A plan forms for all three to get rid of their bosses only as with these crazy far out comedies nothing goes as planned. Things look bad yet in the end they twist the right way as the trio will hopefully live happily for a change. Yet this film is a wild ride very funny and unexpected moments of wild happenings the writing is very funny and far out for a comedy film, it's a chuckle! And it's very enjoyable due to the sex appeal and hot scenes that Jennifer Aniston brings(her black bra and panties scene was sugar and spice good eye candy!) This film is a theme most can relate to of having a horrible boss, and it's a feel good thrill ride to watch as it's fun to see workers conspire in funny and outrageous ways against the top guy, only in the end to have it all work out!",9,1,7,8 July 2011
Black Mass," A violent and blunt look at greed, corruption, and a criminal life for three decades.
","Just recently saw 'Black Mass' from director Scott Cooper and I must say that it's a well done and informative look at the life and times of real life Boston criminal Whitey Bulger(played to near perfection by Johnny Depp). The film goes thru three decades starting in the 1970's to showcase the rise and power going up thru the ranks of crime and it's very violent and blunt in the scenes of blood and murder. Yet along the way bad boy Bulger is helped along with his rise to power by being an informant to the police to take down rival street gangs and other Mafia members on other turfs. Slowly but surely South Boston is controlled by Whitey yet the FBI is showcased as corrupt especially agent John Connolly(Joel Edgerton)as he and others look the other way when information about Bulger comes in it's like fear with bribes and payoffs on the side! Overall good film of greed, corruption, violence that tells the rise and fall of one of the most known criminals ever. And thumbs up to Johnny Depp for a kick butt performance.",8,2,8,24 September 2015
Suicide Squad," Not the best D.C. film, yet not the worst, it's different and unique hey let the bad guys be the showcase and do the dirty work!
","Being a 'Batman' and D.C. comics fan since I watch all the movies and read the comics the latest entry 'Suicide Squad' had to be a must see. And this picture is different and unique as anytime you have the villains and the bay guys shining and doing the dirty work it's a showcase, really it's wild, wicked, and fun chaos! The plot is pretty simple Amanda Waller(Viola Davis)heads up a secret government agency and all of a sudden a black ops mission has come up. And the plan is to get a group of super villains to come out of prison and help with the mission, for in return an exchange for all reduced sentences! Yet the job is fun, wild, wicked, and crazy, to watch the bad boys and oh yes bad girl(Harley Quinn)mop up and do the dirty work is pure pleasure! The film has plenty of action and the super villains most remembered are Deadshot(Will Smith)a guy who's lethal with a bullet and the beast and monster of the underground Gotham sewer Killer Croc is a fright of a joy to watch. And the best eye candy treat is the watching of Harley Quinn(in a sexy performance from Margot Robbie)who's a devious girl who swings hard with the big boys and in a subplot her romance with 'The Joker'(Jared Leto)entertains and spices the film it's like a little extra icing on the cake. Overall this D.C. film is different still it's fun watching the bad guys work as deep down they feel some guilt and dream of a normal better life before facing the real picture, 'Suicide Squad' blends raw aggressive sex appeal with Harley Quinn and the use of 'The Joker' is somewhat of a wild card still it's a good look at the other side of the D.C. universe that exist showing the different way of life that many live.",8,3,6,7 August 2016
Taxi Driver," A classic tale of a loner who's motivated by his own thoughts and he becomes somewhat of a hero to his subculture.
","One of the best and finest films ever made was 1976's 'Taxi Driver' a classic tale that mirrored the 1970's with it's dark and loner anti-establishment views. And director Martin Scorsese moves the film along just fine as he blends the drama in so well with the dark culture showing how society can provoke one's thoughts and lead them to branch out to violence to feel welcomed in their own subculture.In one of his earliest roles the great Robert De Niro is Travis Bickle a young man who's out of the marines and at the age of 26 makes his living driving a taxi in the dark streets of New York City at night. And Travis sees it all at night on the dark corners from junkies, pimps, and street walking whores to the police lights flashing when violence occurs.Travis sees and becomes obsessed with the view of a pretty lady a young and elegant political campaign worker named Betsy(Cybill Shepherd)after asking her out and after dating Betsy sees that Travis has a dark and perverted mind by taking her to an adult movie. Even after the break off Travis becomes sort of a stalker type yet quinces his desire by still going to the adult films and peep shows of New York City. Yet he runs into an interesting catch when he spots a young street walker named Iris(one of Jodie Foster's early roles)who's trying to get away from her violent pimp. Gradually this affects the mood and mind of Travis as he starts to become a product of his own culture and environment by becoming a weapons collector for street safety! Other notable takes are Harvey Keitel as the slick street talking pimp of Iris's and it was nice seeing the now late Peter Boyle as Wizard a veteran cab driver of the streets who gives Travis a few pointers on the yellow night rides. 'Taxi Driver' is a classic film that shows anyone can get caught up in raw culture and we become products of our environment as our thoughts provoke us to become risk takers. Even though as this film ends violent it was rewarding to show that Travis had did a good deed and became a hero of some sort in this tainted subculture of the streets. Overall great film to remember and cherish for it's thought provoking and social impacts.",10,0,0,7 December 2009
Life of Pi," A film of courage, wit, determination, and survival a visual treat!
","Every once and awhile you have a film that comes along like that of 'Life of Pi' one that's a tale of courage, wit, determination, and a survival tale it shows that life was worth living as it's often an unexpected and tough unusual journey. Told mostly in flashback form you now have a grown Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan)and Pi recalls the times and days of his India zoo keeper family. And the most life changing and memorable moment that would shape Pi's life is when his family took a ship movement to Canada only to be wrecked by a sea disaster in the Pacific ocean. After the wicked waves of the Pacific have departed Pi's family on the lifeboat he's left with his most notable zoo animals like a zebra, hyena, orangutan and most watched is a fierce growling grown to love Bengal tiger. Along the way this is a cat and mouse game of will and survival for Pi to live it shows that on an unexpected journey skill and wit can be learned for survival. Aside from the film's personal themes of will and determination the special effects are top notch. And any work from award winning director Ang Lee is a story of discovery and love obtaining and 'Life of Pi' sums up those things. Overall this film is a tribute to courage, wit and the will for survival.",8,1,4,6 December 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," Fun a casino heist of wit and charm, that pays homage to technology and the digital world.
","Well once again Danny Ocean(George Clooney) is back again for round three another casino caper that's full of star power as Clooney again is joined by all-stars Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, and Elliot Gould with this time the story centers around the con of Vegas casino owner Willy Bank(Al Pacino). A new Vegas casino has just opened and Willy Bank who's played perfect by legend Pacino feels good with his right hand lady Abigail(the still hot and sexy Ellen Barkin) yet, Willy hasn't realized he's playing with professionals and revenge is in store, because he had just recently double crossed Reuben(Elliot Gould) out of casino ownership. This time though Danny and his rat pack of boys have new methods and ways to over throw the casino it's mostly the mastermind and manipulation of computers, and the reprogramming of slot machines, and the use of high tech cameras, to the engineering of an earthquake, and manipulation of lie detector testing, to the use of cologne as an aphrodisiac, now that's just to name a few! Really a tribute to the ways that digital technology can be used! And the film is full of plenty of witty lines, and the characters take on their own fake identities even though the plot reveals little about their life in as of a social aspect. Just to mention it was nice to once again see Ellen Barkin and Al Pacino team up again, just remember 1989's beauty 'Sea of Love'. Overall a pretty good film with plenty of star power, fun, wit, and jolly fun to make it interesting as a commercial success and it was surely better than 'Ocean's Twelve'.",7,2,8,9 June 2007
Lost in Translation," A film of connection showing it's important to have a friend and meet a new person for memories if nothing else.
","Finally after all these years I watched 2003's 'Lost in Translation' and I must say it's a wonderful and touching piece of work from writer and director Sofia Coppola. Plus it features one of the screens most underrated actors nice guy Bill Murray and the young beauty Scarlett Johansson adds a nice sugar and spice mix to the tasty picture.Set in Tokyo, Japan it involves Bob Harris(in one of Murray's best and most memorable roles)an actor who's washed up and past his prime as his days of big movie roles have past, now it's whiskey, and wine commercials in the land of the rising sun. And to pass the time away from his wife and kid Bob spends plenty of time bar drinking, until he meets another American and that's Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson in a heartfelt role) a young lady who just graduated college who's still trying to find herself in the big world. Charlotte has made the trip with her photographer husband(Giovanni Ribisi)who's shooting many things all over Japan. And both Bob and Charlotte are restless and unable to sleep only fitting their paths cross one night in the hotel bar.This meeting later becomes friendship as fun and ventures with the citizens of Tokyo are soon discovered, as some of the encounters are touching yet many are memorable and certainly funny. It shows that in life that friendships and encounters are unexpected yet possible with endless possibilities.Overall great film from Sofia it's touching, moving, and it's connected with fun and laughter. It proves it's important to make a friendship connection even if it doesn't involve sex or romance it's still special because it touched a life and most of all it's memorable, because it doesn't matter if it last or not a memory is the most important thing! Great film that's made even better by the chemistry from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, 'Lost in Translation' is one memorable film!",8,1,2,17 March 2011
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A film of sorrow and pain, yet thru outspoken challenge and determination comes hope.
","So far this year out of all the dramas that I've watched 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' has to be the best. As the film is very dark for the way it shows human nature with plenty of sorrow and pain. On the other side the film is blended with dark outspoken black heart type comedy! The performances are near all pro as the on screen chemistry is top notch form with veterans Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, and Frances McDormand(perhaps her best role ever).Set in Ebbing, Missouri in this small town a brutal murder has just taken place that being of a young teenage girl and her mother Mildred(Frances)has chosen to take matters into her own hands by putting up three billboards right in the heart of town to show the locals and also to question authorities as to why the brutal murder and rape of her daughter is still unsolved, as most of all she calls out the local sheriff Willoughby(Woody Harrelson).After this the whole town and media starts to take notice and Mildred will not back down as she puts up with county politics and the red tape from the corrupt and mostly white bread police department. Fun and a pleasure to watch is the conflict and coming to terms that Mildred has with deputy Dixon(in a real head turner from Sam Rockwell)who's a go against the grain local cop who's a little slow with smarts and grammar yet he does the job his way.Overall this is a film of pain and grief and it's a truth seeker, yet it's a stand up outspoken showcase that shows be blunt and outspoken as when answers are needed do it your way and you often have to go against the grain just like the Mildred character. Overall this is one of the better crime dramas I've seen in awhile as it searches for answers and seeks truth in an old fashioned outspoken and blunt kind of way.",9,3,8,27 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Heavy on nostalgia, like a war to end all wars.
",Well what must or more can I say it's a 'Star Wars' movie the latest 'Episode IX' 'The Rise of Skywalker' is an epic spin on many things in the galaxy. Most important it's the fight of the first order that is the main theme. With Rey once again the main hero lead character. The film is also a journey of the Resistance with Rey still in training to use the force. Overall this supposed closure really captures the spirit of the previous films with flashbacks and scenes from past 'Jedi' characters. Overall it may not be the best movie in the series still it's impact tries to end an epic saga.,7,5,11,25 December 2019
American Sniper," A hero in many eyes still yet being a patriot is a tragedy.
","Upon seeing 'American Sniper' many can form their own opinion as to if it's good or bad still it's a drama of bravery and sorrow a drama of life and pain the good and the bad of a patriot as it ends in tragedy! Based upon the true tale of navy seal sniper Chris Kyle(in a good performance by Bradley Cooper)it shows piece by piece the battlefield and war days of his lethal killings by sniper fire! And it's still hard to believe that Clint Eastwood is still directing movies, yet still he proves with this one that he can still make good pictures! As really this is a good drama of life and love as Chris falls in love with a sexy lady gets married has kids and continues the life of a warrior, only to meet tragic means. Overall good film that showcases the good and bad of service life even though it may not be everyone's cup of tea it's worth a watch!",8,13,33,22 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," A witch performance from Streep. Meryl always makes the screen glow.
","I myself have never really been a fan of fashion type movies, but anything with Meryl Streep is well worth a watch. I must say I was pleased when watching 'The Devil Wears Prada' because Streep is so good in this role of a wicked witch New York city fashion magazine editor(Miranda Priestly). I can always see that Streep always takes her roles serious and she puts every ounce of heart and soul into it, making her perhaps the best actress around. This story is somewhat Cinderella like with a smart hard working Ohio girl(Anne Hathaway) who arrives in New York City with high hopes and dreams, but it's not going to be no yellow brick road journey when she lands a job as magazine assistant to the wicked Priestly! I know that all of us male or female can say that we have worked under a boss like Miranda Priestly who's so cold and demanding. All of us at some point have felt used and abused and the Hathaway character experiences the same slave treatment and cold shoulder many of us have felt. Yet because of ambition and determination and a little luck success and happiness is possible. Just like the Hathaway character we learn to look back and miss the tough nature of hard and dedicated love from bosses like Miranda, because the cold nature and tough love only helps us in the ever competitive world. Anne Hathaway gives a fine performance you just root for her underdog role, and good supporting roles are provided from Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt. Mostly this film has the light to shine because of Meryl's strong and no nonsense performance, as always Streep is a pleasure to watch she gives so much to her characters.",6,0,0,11 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," More space wars and the film hints at a darkness in the making.
",Star Wars Episode II-Attack of the Clones is a story that continues the journey of the Jedi Knights and their fight with evil of the dark federation. The film picks up 10 years later with now Anakin Skywalker growing up and more yet he's still being trained by Obi-Wan you can see that young Skywalker is stubborn and soon may slip to the evil side of the dark empire as the top Jedi masters can even feel it. However in the current time Anakin has started a romance with Padme who use to be a former senator and things are more complex when the empire puts out an assassination attempt out on her life. The Jedi army then has to take her back to Naboo for her protection. Still in this episode it's more of the same of space fighting and good facing evil as it's a build up to a revealing episode III.,7,10,16,19 December 2015
Lion," A film of loss, courage, memories, and a search to reconnect after a new life.
","'Lion' is one of those feel good movies of hope and love that has you as the viewer seeing how life can take different directions and new paths in an unexpected way, yet with memories it becomes a journey to go back to one's roots and once again experience love and belonging.The story is pretty simple set in the mid 1980's a young Indian boy becomes lost from his brother on the Calcutta streets as a train leaves. It then becomes a journey and test of the will to live, only it takes a turn when he's adopted by a wealthy Australia couple and life becomes different only still the memories of his early life flash back and fourth only to come full circle and 25 years later this young man finds his mom after many different experiences of love and hope. Overall okay film of love, memories, and hope and the performances from Nicole Kidman, Dev Patel, and Rooney Mara make the film an A okay watch.",7,1,2,8 February 2017
Forrest Gump," One of the best films of all-time. That proves it's meant for everyone to be different and it's okay to live a simple life.
","'Forrest Gump' certainly has to be one of the most heart touching and emotional films that brought joys to the masses over the years. People misjudge it though as a film about a dumb retarded boy named Forrest, yet I see it as a much different take as it proves it's okay to be different and slow and do things at your own pace and let things come to you and then good things will happen in life. Tom Hanks is great as Forrest Gump as the film spans a life period from Forrest's childhood to his growing up, starting with his humble start in a small Alabama town with his mother(wonderfully done by Sally Field). From the start Forrest was different as his mother taught him to see the world and life as a box of chocolates, not knowing what your ever gonna get. Yet by the hardships and for the way that Forrest was made fun of his determination and will would spark him on a life of unexpected but deserved greatness. From his college attending at the university of Alabama to his football playing to fighting in war, and making new friends to meeting the presidents! Also touching is his heartfelt relationship with life love Jenny(Robin Wright Penn). The direction and camera work and special effects of the way the film is crafted by Robert Zemeckis is brilliant and fabulous it makes the film move well from time period to time period. Most of all this film brings the message to me that destiny is often a piece of crap and life many times just goes and happens at random. Most of all it's okay to be different and it proves no matter how different that just by being simple many things can be accomplished, and that with faith and determination with god anything is possible. 'Forrest Gump' is such a memorable winner because he did it his way.",8,1,3,10 April 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Good suspense mystery thriller that shows the powerful abuse power, and it has many twists and turns clearly one of 2007's best!
",'Gone Baby Gone' is one of those movies that keeps you interested as you are on the edge of your seat trying to figure things out from start to finish. It has many twist and turns along the way in the end it proves that powerful people are corrupt and they abuse their power. It was really a fine directorial debut from actor Ben Affleck. Set in Boston the story centers around the case of an apparent abduction of a little girl and when the police are stumped the family members then call on the private detective team of two live in lovers(Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan)to investigate the case. Soon one by one they are entering into a world of twists and turns and a world of drugs and money. As they discover the little girls mother(Amy Ryan)is a rattled and addicted drug user and her connection to the drug underworld may be connected to her girls kidnapping. Yet nothing is what it seems as even the police(Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris) are very shady characters and clearly not who they seem. Overall 'Gone Baby Gone' is wonderful it keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat till the very end clearly one of 2007's best!,8,0,0,25 February 2008
Southpaw," A film of hope and soul finding after you losing it all redemption can be found!
","I must say that the new boxing drama 'Southpaw' is a real knockout film a winner that delivers the punch on both ends for drama and emotion it proves that sometimes before you regain it you must lose it all! Billy Hope(Jake Gyllenhaal)is the raining and best known light heavyweight fighter on the planet who has it all from the championship belt, to a fine home and a fancy car with a cute little daughter to of course a hot sexy trophy colored bra wearing wife named Maureen(Rachel McAdams was just so fine in that sexy silk light pink colored bra scene!). All of a sudden the wife Maureen wants him to have a change of heart and mind and leave the brutal business of boxing, yet one by one Billy's fame and life is ripped away as he has his wife lost in a tragic accident, and thru bad promotion and debt he goes broke losing his home, belt and even due to his drug using ways the courts take away his cute little daughter. Wow Billy has hit rock bottom. Then he connects with trainer Tick Willis(Forest Whitaker)it's thru this time of learning and rediscovery of hope and heart that Billy once again rises to the top! Overall 'Southpaw' breaks your heart with the tragic nature still it's a knockout tribute to the soul and heart for being able to discover that magic punch.",8,23,45,26 July 2015
American Hustle," Good look at the real life world of scandal, bribes, corruption, and greed with ever lasting power struggle.
","'American Hustle' is one of those movies that when you watch you feel entertained and fresh still you feel a little sour and down to earth after you see what the world of greed and power struggle can do to people as each person and every organization is full of corruption and must figure out their own way and methods to survive. Based on the real life scandals of the 1970's mid to late of the 10 year period in New Jersey a con man named Irving Rosenfeld(Christian Bale)meets up with a sexy social kitten Sydney Prosser(in Amy Adams's best and most sexy role)and together they form a team that lures scandal and con games to make money for them as each and every way each scam is tied to different organizations and cruel underworlds. Even when FBI agent Richie Dimaso(Bradley Cooper)enters the investigation he joins the team with a plan to oddly enough set up a crooked and corrupt politician and that's a New Jersey city mayor named Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and you guessed with politics it's dirty laundry that involves power brokers and the mafia. All along Rosalyn Rosenfeld(Jennifer Lawrence)the wife of crime king Irving just drinks up her pain and sorrow of sin in distilled spirits. Overall 'American Hustle' rings true to life as every person is for him or her it's a way of life with greed, corruption and scandal as director David O. Russell again proves with a cast that has great chemistry that life is tough dark and never pretty as sometimes you have to do it ugly just to get by and live.",6,2,9,24 December 2013
Fargo," One of the better and more underrated films of the 90's. An interesting and thrilling crime caper that's holds your interest and it all turns out for the best in the end!
","'Fargo' is clearly one of the better films of the 90's probably one of 1996's best. As always I learned with each film I've watched from the Coen brothers even though most of their plots are a little offbeat they still entertain and hold interest. As evidenced from watching this film it proves even ordinary people anywhere can finds themselves caught up in crazy things that involve unexpected twist and turns yet somehow it all solves it's self in the end.Set in the great northern united states mostly taking place in a small Minnesota town it involves William H. Macy as a desperate car salesman who wants money. And he will do anything even if it means arranging a crazy scheme to have his wife kidnapped so he could get ransom money from her well to do father. And that's just what he does when he contacts two stone cold thugs(one who's played brilliant by Steve Buscemi who enjoys having sex with truck stop prostitutes and escorts on the side!) from Fargo, North Dakota to travel to Minnesota to kidnap his wife. As with any Coen brothers movie it gets interesting as the drama comes in the most unexpected ways the plan goes not as planned as then a crazy game of chase and phone tag develops.Enter the wild card and key element of the film as her character added such common ground and normalcy in a fantastic and blazing performance Frances McDormand is very memorable as the small town Minnesota deputy who investigates. As you really feel for her character she's so plain spoken like most in the film with her north mid western draw accent she's also pregnant yet she continues to fight hard on the investigation and come thru and break the case open like breaking ice on the cold Minnesota lakes.Overall 'Fargo' is a film that holds your interest the whole time as it's blended so well with suspense drama and dark humor that thrills it just makes you think just like so many other Coen brother films. And the performances and chemistry of the cast is super it just proves ordinary people can find themselves twisted up in crazy things only to all have back to normal in the end. Really a unique film that's memorable and very good.",8,1,2,22 June 2009
Rush," Exciting and heart pounding addictive pumping it proves that life is a race it's always a drive.
","Anyone knows that Ron Howard always makes a good movie and he can bring true stories to the big screen so well, and here he did just fine with 'Rush' the real life story of a 1970's rivalry between two world class formula one race car drivers. You have mister hotshot himself points leader and ladies man playboy type the English man James Hunt(Chris Hemsworth). And aside from the hard life of drinking and partying and going to bed with beautiful women left and right he wins race after race around the globe all of a sudden James has a challenge and that's in the form of new driver the serious Austrian Niki Lauda(Daniel Bruhl in a great performance). These two rivals are different like daylight and dark their personal styles go like for one Niki is cool and calm and quiet and pretty boy James is never at a loss for attention. Yet the subplots of personal styles take a backdrop to the thrilling scenes of the heart pounding races the two have against each other on international tracks. This film really did a good job with it's recreation of telling the 1970's world of formula one racing which had a rivalry that not many people knew about. 'Rush' is a film of personal connection and friendship proving that life is close and always a race on the track no matter what lap you finish in.",8,2,3,27 September 2013
Predator," Tough Guy kick butt action cult sci-fi midnight type film!
","Remember 1987's 'Predator' which is now seen as a cult art house midnight classic still in it's day it was an action packed science thriller that entertained and was an interesting watch. Arnold(Major Dutch) who along with a group of commandos is sent on an apparent rescue mission to Central America, however upon arriving he finds it's a spin and a different game! One by one thru the jungles and deep trees a strange creature lurks. And one by one the crew and team members become victims. As a strange alien type warrior brings blood and wrath! Also look for appearances from Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura. Overall it feels like camp still it's an entertaining cult midnight style flick!",6,0,3,28 May 2019
Nightcrawler," A rogue camera guy! It proves people will kill to get a news story of crime and it shows the underworld is media's bread and butter!
","This new picture 'Nightcrawler' speaks for it's own it's a picture that's bold, bleak, blunt and honest in a dark kind of way proving that people will win at all cost for a media story and crime stories of the underworld is the bread and butter of the media! Set in L.A. the city of angels you have Lou Bloom(in a dark and raw performance from Jake Gyllenhaal)as a young man who's a loner and a dark character as he makes his living from stealing metal and selling it as he lives a sad life in a one room L.A. apartment while driving a high mileage older model Toyota car. Being out at night he sees the streets and the darkness of underworld night action in L.A. and how that it attracts news, so a light has come on he must buy a camera and start recording the action footage as it happens and sell the footage! Slowly one by one Lou becomes a new L.A. crime journalist as each night he sees car crashes, blood, murders, police chases, and shootouts and he gets them all on camera as they occur and this real life footage he then takes into the last place news station in L.A., and it's here at this station the news manager Nina(the raw and attractive Rene Russo)has a plan this footage will air for ratings! All while Lou collects a buck so he can soon start his own news footage company! Overall this film is entertaining though dark it proves that news and the media is all about thrills, spills, and underworld drama as that is what leads to news company profits, in today's age the media and journalism is hungry for drama and a news making story at any and all cost it's what drives people and the culture of society.",8,1,4,2 November 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," Well done biography type film of a conflicted music legend!
","Was a fan of 'Queen' and enjoyed listening to their music I liked the sounds and the beat along with the lyrics. And remembered one Freddie Mercury and his tragic death at 45 in 1991 of AIDS. And with this picture it sheds life on his rise to stardom and greatness with his other band members as 'Queen' became one of the greatest in rock history.Shown are Freddie's humble start and how he leaves his family to go after his dreams and for a short time he had a female love in Mary Austin, however Mercury struggled with inner conflict as he was a bisexual man who battled his own demons. Along the way the inner conflict and fame with ego and other pressures had Freddie at one period being solo, all before returning to 'Queen'.The film is well done and acted as Rami Malek is in top form as Freddie and the music and concert scenes of tours bring back memories of the famous 'Queen' songs as the movie shows right up till the Live Aid concert in 1985, and it shows Mercury dealing with AIDS before his 1991 death. Overall some might have said his nature was dark and complex still he and the 'Queen' band are lifelong champions!",8,1,3,4 November 2018
Burn After Reading," Funny and neat work from the Coens. A nice concept of mixing the plot and intersecting it with complex characters.
","Certainly this Coen brothers comedy 'Burn After Reading' will not be no Oscar winner like their previous effort 'No Country for Old Men', but still the direction and over the top funny story makes this offbeat film one to watch. Many may see this as a spoof crime caper type and in many ways it is as it involves a plot of hidden info and the CIA. Plus for commercial success the all-star cast makes it watchable as each portray interesting characters with different attitudes who's lives intersect with a CD-ROM. John Malkovich is Osborne Cox a recently canned CIA agent who's down on his luck as his relationship with his pediatrician wife the classy and elegant Katie(Oscar winner Tilda Swinton)is about to go up into flames. As on the side Katie is seducing womanizer and federal government employee Harry Dfarrer(George Clooney).So the film has already introduced some complex characters now enter the big plot and theme of the movie two dim-witted fitness gym employees(Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) come across one of Mr. Cox's old CD-ROM disc of classified information from his CIA days. Then one by one this film presents a fun to watch hoot of mishap and adventures as you see how each conflicted character is drawn together over a simple little disc of information as in the end each life has been shaped differently. Pretty good work from the Coens as the theme and concept was neat and funny even though it may not be a critical success the star power of Pitt, Clooney, McDormand, Malkovich, and Swinton will make it a commercial success. So to sum it up it's a pretty good feel good film to watch that you will have fun with.",7,2,5,14 September 2008
Justice League," A showcase of D.C.'s finest with teamwork to fight evil!
","Being a comic book reader and fan of 'Batman' and D.C. characters I went out to see this latest work and it's a showcase of the D.C. universe and the fight against meta humans. Plus the return of 'Superman' from death he is risen! Still all heroes involved are working thru their own problems as 'Batman' grapples with the business world and his alter ego Bruce Wayne and 'Wonder Woman' still has business to deal with on the island.Now enter the new kids on the block first the super train fast 'Flash'(Erza Miller)who's flawed with family problems as his dad's in prison so this little red suited guy has a lot to run to and prove! Now enter the king and fish of the deep sea the one and only 'Aquaman'(Jason Momoa)who's not our typical Aqua hero(if you remember the old comics of a skinny blond dude)who's a raw and wicked long haired heavy metal rocker looking type.This film really isn't great it entertains with nice action and showcases the D.C. hero fleet as people who face problems of everyday life, yet win by being a D.C. hero as we all remember.",6,2,5,17 November 2017
The Thing," A blend of horror sci-fi
","Always been a fan of horror and sci-fiction movies, and plus almost always like the works of John Carpenter, finally watched this cult classic 1982's 'The Thing'. And I must say clearly not the greatest or far from the best of John's works, still it entertained for it's blend of suspense and finding the unknown.Certainly a different type of film the plot is set in the winter of 1982 in a Antarctic research station and things goes crazy when a helicopter fires and a dog is killed. All of this leads to the discovery of a creature who's been buried in the snow. And once discovered gore and blood like transformation is wrecked upon everyone as it's like life changing forms of the body! Look for some early work of Kurt Russell in this chiller.",6,1,3,16 November 2018
The Revenant," An epic adventure that's a struggle a fight for survival that's overcome by spirit and faith.
","'The Revenant' is without a doubt one film that thrills with drama and action and it's filled with blood and it shows that human life can often be pushed to the extremes. It also blends themes of faith, survival and revenge to fine form. Actually the picture is based on the true life story of Hugh Glass an 1820's fur trapper and his quest for survival. And the cinematographer work is well done as the scenes of nature and wilderness is stunning it seems so real as it almost takes a little from the narrative as it seems the images move this long drawn out adventure film.Anyway Leonardo DiCaprio(in his best performance yet)is Hugh Glass the 19th century hunter who stalks the American west on guard with his rifle. The peace and beauty of the outdoors is shattered quickly in the film as the Glass camp of fur traders are attacked in a blood and gore carnage by Native Americans. This begins a saga a journey mission of search and escape and this all involves Hugh and his son and thru time flashback you find out about the demise of Hugh's wife. And in a fun and compelling and seems like real yet very brutal and blood bath like is the grizzly bear attack fight sequence that leaves Glass to almost die. After this the adventure becomes more about a struggle to survive and a journey that has twist and turns all it really turns into is a revenge hunt that Glass must seek as payback can be hell.Overall 'The Revenant' is a harsh and tough emotional film that proves life is a struggle as one must fight for life all while dealing with faith, and the spirit of believe as it's supported by loving nature and loving family just as Glass did. And the performance from Leonardo DiCaprio is his best ever he pushed himself to the limit for this role nearly transforming his look and enduring the cold and snow type scenes that he had to shoot in, yet all in all that helped make 'The Revenant' an emotional drama that shows tough images yet it dazzles.",9,4,10,9 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," A film of standing for what you believe in and negotiating!
",'Bridge of Spies' is a thriller starring Tom Hanks that was set during the Cold War times which involved a rescue mission of a Soviet spy. For any history buff or film fan of Tom Hanks this is one to see. Hanks is James B. Donovan a New York insurance lawyer who all of sudden one day gets selected by the CIA to go on a rescue mission of a spy. All of this is during the height of the Cold War. And thru it all a lot of secrets of government and under the table stuff is learned. All which involves negotiations of getting the spies released on both sides which includes America and Soviet Union spies. Overall this film is a test of defense and make a deal to fight for what is right proving that is the right way to get justice and freedom.,7,3,10,17 October 2015
American Psycho," A good satire of a modern day serial killer. Plus it captures the 1980's really well.
","I for one am not really a big Christian Bale fan even though his performances are pretty good especially his 'Batman' efforts. I must say though that this satire was pretty direct and his performance strong. With today's media culture obsessed with murder and serial killers this film 'American Psycho' can give film fans a nice taste for their thirst. Set in 1980's New York City you have Bale as wall street and power hungry yuppie Patrick Bateman who's at the top of his game he has a nice apartment, nice clothes, and plenty of lady friends. And also he's a pop culture quoting champ of the current times and 80's music. Yet behind it all deep down he's a psychopath who murders, it doesn't matter if it's strangers or people he knows. This really showed a side of a Ted Bundy type a good outward appearance, but a demon on the inside. Plus this film really captured the 80's scene well by the way it showed the hairstyles, clubs, drugs, and it was well evidenced as it played some of the better hit songs from the 1980's. Overall good film with a good Bale performance it may not be everyone's cup of tea yet it explores the greatest decade well while showcasing the dark side of life proving even the best supposed outward appearance can be terrifying and chilling underneath and on the inside.",7,1,2,23 May 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Inspirational and touching. Mixed emotions both dark and bright.
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is without a doubt one of the most endearingly family movies in film history. The Hoover family is certainly likable and down to earth, but each have their own faults some very dark. It all begins with over-caring mother(Toni Collette) who lends support to her depressed and homosexual college professor brother(Steve Carell) who just got away from the hospital after a suicide attempt, moves in with the family. To further bring differences the household is rounded out by a hard working father(Greg Kinnear) who is trying to sell his motivational success as a book, but the sales pitch has little success among both family and his employers. The dark person in the family is certainly grandpa(Alan Arkin) who's brilliant as a foul-mouthed extrovert who's very profane with a snorting heroin habit. Now the children of the family are different as daylight and dark, the son(Paul Dano)who's taken a vow of silence to reach his goal, pales in comparison to the daughter(Abigail Breslin) who's bright and adorable as an average little girl with above average dreams of someday being Miss America. The journey and complex light of these people all come together when they take a road trip from their New Mexico home to California so little Olive can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. The family just creeps along in their white and yellow VW bus which is running on it's last legs. Along the way you see this family as very dysfunctional and their souls appear tortured, but as a whole all seem to roll along together. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a film about an unbending family wanting to be winners, and it's nice to see a film that highlights a common family with real and believable problems, proving it's not always if you win but how you play your game, and it's important to get enjoyment out of your experiences and journeys. Some of the scenes are memorable and all performances are good, but the work of Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin is super.",8,1,3,8 February 2007
Hugo," Not your typical Marty picture, still wonderful and unique work with history and effects.
","Director Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors around typically his films include drama and a look at the dark side of urban life, here with this picture 'Hugo' he showcases history and special effects at work in this good touching family drama that revisits the past to bring happiness. I saw this work in 3D and I must say the effects and camera work along with the storytelling is in top form the visuals lift the viewer on a magic carpet ride. Set in 1930's Paris, France involving a tale of a young boy who discovers a secret to take him back to the early days of film. So if you like feel good cheer and film history this is a picture for you.Asa Butterfield is Hugo Cabret an orphan who's late father left him a gift of mystery a robot who runs by automaton, and along the way Hugo has to search for clues and face drama at the train station and also he has a little puppy love with Isabelle(Chloe Moretz)and he finds that his dad's invention is connected to an ex actor and now toy store shop clerk Geoges Melies(Ben Kingsley). Overall 'Hugo' is a film big on special effects, storytelling and it honors film history in a unique way, not typical Scorsese work but wonderful work for it's different style. 'Hugo' is a shining bright moon to view!",7,2,4,2 February 2012
The Shining," An excellent psychological horror drama. And one of Jack's most memorable and iconic roles('Heeeere's Johnny!')
","If you've read the novel from Stephen King then you know it is quite different from Stanley Kubrick's adaptation. King who's novel is long and drawn out and it goes into more detail as is the case with most books. Kubrick on the other hand made the film long also yet his focus was more of an enchanting and psychological chilling visual masterpiece. Stanley was always so good for the fact that when shooting his films the scenes shot were always done in a manner of detail with a great camera touch. You add this with the performance of Jack Nichoslon(my favorite actor)who's over the top and out right crazy here with his role as was so common in his acting roles(example: 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and as the 'Joker' in 'Batman') 'The Shining' turns out to be a horror masterpiece as most agree it was one of Warner Brothers most acclaimed and successful films of all time.Nicholson is Jack Torrance an ex school teacher and now writer who moves his wife Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny(Danny Lloyd) a clairvoyant to the Overlook hotel in Colorado, where he has just been hired as winter caretaker. This is an old and elegant style hotel of many alleys and room floors, yet soon behind it all this place reveals a haunted past of ghostly secrets it's a past time of ghostly madness. Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson give good supporting performances as hotel employees.And the creme of the crop my man Nicholson gives a stirring and most memorable iconic performance as a man who's guilt ridden the film is a good character study of a man coming to terms with his guilt and family problems only sadly he gets wrapped up in the ghostly and sinister past of the overlook. Nicholson was at his angered and shocking best even during the dreamlike track shots and remember the famous line that still sticks in pop culture 'Heeeere's Johnny!'. The film is moved just fine by Stanley's direction it blends well with his musical score which is so pulsating and creepy. In the end it proves the past can suck you in and haunt you, and also that each and every place has hidden secrets as in this case it was a ghostly past a time warp. Overall a great horror classic.",10,1,2,31 December 2008
American Beauty," A good look at family angst and life drama. Showing the desire to live again and to feel young is seen thru beauty and daydreams. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
",After years I finally watched this highly acclaimed film from Sam Mendes and I must say 'American Beauty' is one of those films that anyone can enjoy for the message it sends that people can rediscover youth and life again thru what they see. It proves a strong point everyone sees something different and beauty is always in the eye of the beholder.The story is just perfect set in the suburbs the terrific Kevin Spacey is Lester Burnham a middle age man in a midlife crisis who feels down as he even feels the end is near he has nothing to live for. Even though he has a good paying job as a magazine article writer and also he's married to a prim and proper elegant lady named Carolyn(Annette Bening)to add on to that his teenage daughter Jane(Thora Birch). Still Lester feels lonely and tired as if he's caught up in a never ending spin cycle of conformity. Lester needs to feel young again and he needs to discover the will to live again.It's upon noticing his daughters best teenage female school friend the hot and sexy Angela(Mena Suvari)that's when his feel of youth and rediscovery of life is felt again. And it's showed by his working out to get in shape and his fantasies of beautiful daydreams feature Angela. So tired with the high class life Lester quits his job and even resorts to flipping burgers and he finally sees for real what a phony marriage he had as Mrs. prissy Carolyn has turned out to be a cheating lady.For many they might find this film challenging and probably like me be a little displeased with in my opinion the tragic end. Still 'American Beauty' is a classic for showing how by just seeing simple beauty of youth can change a person and make them feel young again and it opens up the need to live life all over again. Beauty brings happiness and hope. Most important this film proves the old saying true 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder'.,9,0,1,30 March 2009
Disturbia," Pretty good horror flick. Don't look out your window and don't learn who your new neighbor is!
","Just saw 'Disturbia' and overall a pretty good horror film. It has a little suspense, drama, voyeurism, and sexiness and fright all blended in one. You have Shia LaBeouf as a teenage boy who losses his father in a car accident, then he starts to fill the pain of growing up without a dad despite having a loving and caring mother who's played just great by Carrie-Anne Moss who gives a strong performance in this film. Then one day at school he losses his temper punches a teacher, then he's sentenced to house arrest! the only entertainment he can find is TV, listening to his music, and playing video games. His best hobby is thru the binoculars of window spying at the sexy and hot next door girl played by the attractive Sarah Roemer! When women start disappearing one by one and end up murdered then fear of a town serial killer is reported. With the spying and eagerness a new person in the neighborhood is encountered a mysterious and tough looking man played by the rough and rugged David Morse a villain part he was well suited for. Then the disturbances starts from first fear of life, to hostage taking and just all out fright. It proves be careful of strangers, and it shows you don't always know your community members and that many have dark secrets and they don't appear to be who they are, so be careful! Pretty good horror and suspense flick so check out 'Disturbia'",6,2,6,28 April 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," Humble, emotional, hurtful, and touching it proves that damaged hearts have a chance at love!
","'Silver Linings Playbook' is one of those films that you could classify as a drama, love story, sports film or raw comedy and true the picture has all those mixtures. Still it's one film that's filled with emotion that when one watches they will like. And be like me just don't watch the film because your a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, because the picture has so much to offer in the form of a love chance and a second discovery of peace and life for two hurt young people. Based on a true story then done as a book the direction on the screen is near perfect from David Russell. Anyway set in Philadelphia, PA you have Pat Solitano(in a breakout role for Bradley Cooper)an ex school teacher who's just recently left a mental ward after being treated for bi polar disorder and it's clear he probably has no chance with his ex wife. So Pat returns home to his parents mom the laid back and soft spoken Dolores(Jacki Weaver)is still with dad that's the rough and hard nose fight you in your face Philadelphia Eagles fan Pat Sr.(in one of Rob De Niro's better roles in awhile)so is this all that Pat junior has to look forward to bleeding green on Sundays and trying to read literature. Well just when you think the expected the unexpected happens Pat meets a beautiful yet troubled still outspoken and brash young lady in Tiffany(in a mature and fine performance from Jennifer Lawrence). And along the way some relationship chemistry develops slowly but surely as it proves trust can develop between two wounded hearts with some time. Really enough words can't describe this film as one needs to watch it to feel the full emotions. It proves that damaged hearts that meet have a chance for love as time, work, and compassion can heal a damaged mind proving with anybody that love in the book can cure all as two troubled people together who love one another can produce a silver lining in the end.",9,3,9,13 December 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Complex and in depth mystery that's spiced with raw and erotic feel good sex appeal.
","I for one am not a big reader of novels, and I have never read 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo', yet I must say that David Fincher's in depth and long drawn out film adaptation had me in interest with suspense and complex thought. As one knows any Fincher film often shows the brutal and raw nature of life and with many scenes in this picture he pulled back no punches. As one watches this complex drama a mystery of dirty secrets will unfold and the film is guided by it's grit and raw erotic sex scenes which keep the viewer even more intrigued.The story involves soviet journalist Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel Craig)who's a man that's clearly a little burned out with his work only it once again gets interesting when he's hired by a rich international family man Henrik Vanger(the superb Christopher Plummer)to investigate the disappearance of one of his dear loved ones a young girl in the family. Only soon thru it all Mikael's investigation will lead to more and more gruesome discovered disappearances and brutal murders. On the side in an interesting subplot is the arrival of an exotic and strange computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander(in a raw and gritty performance from Rooney Mara)and she is Mikael's assistance to breaking the secrets and lies of the dark past underworld of many cases. Along the way the passion of hot erotic and kinky sex encounters occur between the two which spices the film up some. And as always with a Fincher film he shows how brutal life can be it's often raw and wicked as evidenced by the blunt and provocative rape scene.Overall good film that will hold your interest even though it's drawn out and complex it's one interesting mystery of secrets, and an interesting journey. The film shows that life is raw and often mysterious with secrets and lies.",8,3,9,28 December 2011
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Hilarious raunchy comedy! You pull for the loner underdog just because he wants to score with a female!
","I must say that Judd Apatow done a brilliant and beautiful job with this raunchy and foul comedy. It's something that seems down to earth and very funny that most can relate to that's relationships of finding the right one and sex. Only this comedy is a tale of a man that's a 40 year old virgin! You must say how sad and awful, but it's happened I'm sure. You have Steve Carell as Andy Stitzer a nice and shy loner type who can be described as a hard working electronics sales clerk, yet he's a nerd who loves his action figure collection(which his life is built around)and he spends most of his time playing video games and reading comics. Then one night over a game of poker with friends it's revealed he's a virgin! It's so apparent when he compares a females breast to feeling like a bag of sand now how funny! Andy must then go thru torture and shame from friends and co-workers, they try everything to get him to score by taking him to bars to try and pick up sluts and drunks to dating games to just about everything. Then finally he meets a hot and attractive grandmother(played by Catherine Keener) and it first seems so odd, but slowly and surely a relationship develops finally it turns to a pleasure and satisfying end! Really the gags and crudeness of talk don't take away from the film it's entertaining and funny very memorable scenes are the chest waxing, and the scene of Andy's struggles with how to put on a condom! You as the viewer also feel compassion and happiness for a lonely character of Andy's to finally score but more importantly find life long love. Really a great comedy with plenty of laughs even though raunchy the compassion and emotions overrides and produces a memorable comedy. Great acting from Steve Carell and well done and written by Judd Apatow.",9,0,2,18 August 2007
Dunkirk," A powerful film of determination, and will to survive thru battle, with skill and hope.
","I see most movies of war and will even watch most Christopher Nolan films and I finally saw his latest called 'Dunkirk' as it's a look at the world war II setting days with plenty of drama. One could call this film a historical war drama, yet mostly it's a showcase of having the will and courage to survive and it's a look at connections of emotions with some great camera work.The movie unfolds by land and air with a lot of fire and action by aircraft and boats, and showing how hundreds of British and allied forces are trapped on the beaches of 'Dunkirk' with enemy forces closing in. Up above aircraft helps the stranded men below, as many small boats are present for rescue as all of this is a race against the time clock to live.Overall well done film that proves working together with numbers and connections help bring emotions and provide great need and the will to live and stay alive in the roughest times on the rocky sea waters of battle.",8,0,1,21 December 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," Blunt and entertaining real life raw story of one man's fight to live!
","Matthew McConaughey really is starting to do wonderful work in film and this is very clear with his performance of Ron Woodroof, a role that was meant for Matthew as he makes this real life Texas cowboy seem so real. 'Dallas Buyers Club' is one emotional, raw and tragic film that shows a viewer that sometimes a person must take matters into their own hands. As for one Ron Woodroof it was a matter of life and death. Set in 1985 at the early start of the AIDS dawn in Texas near Dallas Ron Woodroof(Matthew McConaughey)is a hard living 'Jack Daniels' drinking and drug snorting partying type who loves having casual sex on the side with wild women when he's not being a bull rider or working as an electrician. And after upon discovery that he has HIV and told he has 30 days to live, it's then that Ron starts a plan. You guessed it Woodroof can't get the expensive AZT drug in America and many other drugs he's heard about the American FDA won't approve so it's now time for some globe trotting from Mexico to Japan to get and transport some non approved drugs for himself and many other AIDS patients back to the United States! Ron even starts his own business calling it the 'Dallas Buyers Club'! As Ron is fighting more and more to prevent getting full blown AIDS. In a beautiful and raw supporting role is the help that Ron gets from an AIDS patient and AZT user named Rayon a bisexual hooker and strong drug user(in Jared Leto's best ever role!) Thru it all Woodroof fights the establishment to the fullest he's clearly not a yes man! This film showed that one man's voice was for the fight to live and the freedom to medicate and experiment with the will to live, I'm glad 'The Dallas Buyers Club' showcased one great antihero in Ron Woodroof.",10,6,10,23 November 2013
The Exorcist," Excellent film. A memorable and shocking impacting classic. Psychologically scary, a question and test of faith.
","I remember growing up as a kid and my mother telling me about a film called 'The Exorcist' and how that when she watched it that she had nightmares for months. My mom was even afraid to go asleep. So finally after several years later when I got into my early and mid twenties I decided to do several viewings of 'The Exorcist' so I could feel the effects of it. And I must say it's a very powerful film maybe one of the best ever made. It's a film that's subject matter demonic possession left me psychologically frightened and really if you felt like me asking about faith, and it really proves that great forces of evil exist in the world. The first couple of viewings alone had me worried about nightmares only believing positive and having strong faith helped get me thru and with more viewings the effects aren't as bad.'The Exorcist' based on similar real life events was adapted also from William Petter Blatty's novel. Directed by William Friedkin his portrayal of images and depiction of scenes are really shocking as he behind the camera really pushed this work beyond the limits. Set in Washington D.C. in the college town of Georgetown actress Chris MacNeil(beautifully done by Ellen Burstyn)has just arrived to act in her latest film she's divorced and she's brought along daughter Regan(Linda Blair in a very harrowing and near perfect performance)who's so sweet and innocent. Yet gradually Regan starts to feel different as things start to happen inside her body and her surroundings are shaken up. But medical experts can find nothing wrong.It becomes clear this is no medical problem this is a bad case of devil possession! Interesting is a subplot involving a young local priest Father Karras(wonderfully done by Jason Miller)who's a man who is battling his own personal demons aside from faith he feels guilt from not being in New York when his sick mother passed away. Ironically Miss MacNeil will turn to Karras(a conflicted man who has doubts about priesthood) for help as his education in psychiatry of the spiritual nature will be the best way to battle Regan's demons. Plus with the help of Father Merrin(played blunt and to stone perfection from Max Von Sydow) an expert on possession that is the best way to battle the demons of this badly haunted little girl.And many scenes in the film are frightening and grossly harrowing from the green vomit and bloody cross masturbation scene many viewers that watch especially religious will be highly disturbed. It was reported that the role of Regan had such an impact on a young Linda Blair that she required help from a psychologist during filming and I can believe that due to the films subject matter and the many mature scenes that the young girl had to deal with. A nice side dish is the supporting performance of one screen veteran Lee J. Cobb as the straight arrow and folksy Lt. Kinderman. Overall the entire cast of the film is superb.Really what more can I say 'The Exorcist' is a powerful film it came along in a decade and time(the 1970's)when motion picture was at it's best. The scenes though disturbing were harrowing and affecting to one's mind and Linda Blair was over the top probably one of the better performances in film history for a youth. 'The Exorcist' proved that evil really does exist in the world and demonic possession can happen, as many people will tell you after watching this film it has them thinking about their soul. As really this picture is a test of faith. I took from it everything will be okay just remember have faith in god then you don't have to fear anything. 'The Exorcist' is a powerful work a strong film with a haunting theme a classic that's memorable, frightening, and visually shocking and haunting forever. It's clearly one of the best pictures ever made a truly defining work.",10,4,6,30 December 2010
Jackie," A portrait of grace, sorrow, tragedy, elegance, memories, and grief.
","Being a history and film buff I had to see 'Jackie' as it's a historical film of the memories and times of the life and assassination of President John Kennedy, as told thru flashback and grief trauma memories from the elegant and class act first lady Jackie Kennedy(in a beautiful performance from the wonderful Natalie Portman). Starting like an interview style of a film told by flashback flashback the movie takes place after the death of 'JFK', as Jackie is interviewed about the experience and the memories of the death and the impact of the administration, all of this brings out sorrow and emotions from Jackie(as Natalie showed the grief and anger on screen so well)it's just like you as the viewer feel the pain of the first lady. Overall good film that's a showcase of memories showing how tragedy and loss can affect a strong lady along with a nation, this picture is a watch for any history or film buff.",7,7,9,2 February 2017
No Strings Attached," Sex and more sex! A nice treat of eye candy it proves that thru this love might just be possible.
","As with most romantic comedies they are typically funny and predictable and most teach that love, and life is complex and unexpected. This film 'No Strings Attached' stays true to it's title it shows love and life is complex and it's made enjoyable by plenty of eye candy scenes of hot steamy sex between the two lead characters! Can just sex lead to love the film leaves you the viewer hoping and maybe guessing still the film's main theme of sex shows that romance of the physical kind is to be enjoyed.Directed by Ivan Reitman('Ghostbusters')this film shows that a romantic commitment is tough to obtain, but the naughty sex is very fun baiting and enjoyable. It involves Emma(Natalie Portman in a very sexy role)who after leaving Michigan for the lands of sunny California to do her medical interns as a doctor meets a boy named Adam(Ashton Kutcher) she knew him in college and now he's a young hotshot who wants to be a sitcom director/ producer. And right away the two agree to have a relationship of bed adventures and just good old fashioned sex.And this film has plenty of enjoyable eye candy scenes of bed hopping as with each encounter the sex with Emma and Adam becomes more and more steamy and hot. Nice were seeing scenes of Natalie in those sexy light flowered blue and purple colored bras! Anyway as many may know and have experienced sex may lead to love as especially Adam feels emotional attachment, as little lady Emma feels she is to much of a traditional girl to go without a string, so the passions cool off.Only after both want love especially more so Emma the film's supporting female characters shine more as love proves it finds people unexpectedly and at the least expected times. As Emma's female friends find love. Well what about her and Adam as the film proves and shows starting over is okay as even after all of the hot sex a chance of love still is possible even though it will be complex. Overall pretty good comedy it's a real treat of eye candy as it's theme of sex and bed hopping will have most viewers enjoying and seeing Natalie Portman was a real treat. It's title rings true more and more relationships are for only sex joy with no strings attached as love is only a complex hope.",8,7,17,26 January 2011
Tropic Thunder," A funny film that tries to put everything together. It's all skit filled and a mock of film parody.
","'Tropic Thunder' was not a favorite of mine. True the acting is pretty good and the film is funny as it tries to put something together. Yet in the biggest way it's nothing serious as the film really just boils down to a parody and skit mock of other films. You have well known stars as Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. who all portray big Hollywood stars. And all of them have agreed to help their struggling careers to get together and do a war picture a friendship type film that is mostly funny a comedy that mocks fun at many others really just a big film parody. In the scenes you see films like 'Easy Rider', 'Platoon', and 'Apocalypse Now' portrayed and mocked. Like I said the film has good performances from big name stars the most notable one was Downey Jr. still it fell short on my list because of it's lack of drama and seriousness. Still if you want a good laugh and like film parody check it out.",6,1,2,22 February 2009
No Country for Old Men," Well done. Exciting and entertaining crime drama epic from the Coen brothers that's intelligent and interesting.
","'No Country for Old Men' is without a doubt one of the better films I've seen in a long time. It's well mixed with suspense, drama, action, and intrigue the entire time to keep the viewer on the edge. Yet many may feel like me and feel displeased at the ending, but the Coen brothers wanted everyone to form their own call and to think about the right closure. The scenes are well done too and the acting is super especially from veterans Brolin and Jones.Set across the state of Texas mostly in rural sites and crossing over to some metro areas the film is a joyride from the start. Beginning with hunter Llewelyn Moss(Josh Brolin)who makes a gruesome discovery of dead bodies and also a stash of cash like two million from an apparent drug deal gone wrong near Rio Grande and the Mexican and American border. From then on the action and journey begins when ruthless and cold stoned looking criminal thug Anton Chigurh(Javier Bardem who plays the part brilliant)goes hot on the trail of the missing cash all across the state from car chases to even a hotel shootout. Many of the scenes are memorable like that of Anton's flipping of the coin to decide the life and fate of the store clerk by heads or tails! The Coen brothers use the cat and mouse theme so well between these two central characters so well it makes the film even more enjoyable to watch.Yet at a half point of the film it feels a little odd when Woody Harrelson enters as bounty hunter Carson Wells which in my opinion was a wild card character that the Coen brothers used but why who knows. The leader and weight of the film is carried by the Tommy Lee Jones character that of veteran and old timer type burned out Texas sheriff Bell. The film opens with narration and closes with narration from the Bell character. And as always watching and hearing Tommy Lee is special, as his character feels out of touch as time and life has passed him up in which many can relate and feel for when they watch.Overall 'No Country for Old Men' is highly enjoyable and entertaining to watch and intelligently done from the Coen brothers. In my opinion I didn't really like the ending, but many films leave the viewer to form their own take and make the call for themselves adding more suspense and intrigue to the enjoyment. Still the strong performances from Jones, Bardem and Brolin along with the films action and suspenseful journey of drama make it a clear winner and instant classic.",10,1,3,19 January 2008
Batman Begins," A modern graphic and hard edged and hard core dark origins film. A nice reboot of the 'Batman' movies.
","In 2005 with 'Batman Begins' the public got to see a new look and vision of 'Batman' and thanks to director Christopher Nolan it was time that the bat movies took on more of a new direction especially one that focused on characterizations and this would tell more about the dark knights origins. Unlike the other films that showed Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) as always being a spoiled wronged rich playboy who decided to fight crime and evil after the murder of his parents, Nolan decided to show it a little different. True Wayne's parents were killed in a tragedy, yet as Nolan shows Wayne wasn't always good as thru his youth he developed a lust and a knack for the wrong by committing small crimes of his own. It's then we see while locked away at an international prison that Wayne fights to come to terms with his dark past of fear and the one man who mentors him is the tough yet harsh and strange Henri Ducard(Liam Neeson)who's style is that of a death penalty punisher. Wayne takes the training but his methods become more of a justice fighter against evil not an agent of death. As he returns to Gotham after many years to reunite with family friend and butler Alfred(played wonderful by Michael Caine)Wayne has ideas thru his enterprise to develop into a new type of person and that's into 'Batman' to fight crime! As the city is over flowing with crime, corruption and greed as the only cop that 'Batman' has trust in is Jim Gordon(Gary Oldman)as any bat fan knows this would later be police chief. Night by night the city has a new knight to strike fear into the hearts of evil as he has confronted his fear and by using strength, high-tech weapons and smarts he is a force to the evil of Gotham. Bale was great as 'Batman' he was very direct and he acted well as his nature fit the costume well. Really a great reboot from Nolan at a time when the classic legendary comic series needed it especially on the big screen. It shed new light on my favorite hero after seeing a different and more hard edged characterization of his origins. So all that makes for a great film.",8,1,2,12 July 2008
To Rome With Love," A magical romantic fantasy of dreams that are interconnected person to person!
","Haven't been the biggest Woody Allen fan I for one know that his films are mostly international and involve love, drama, and dreams. And this latest 'To Rome with Love' clearly fits those themes as it's a watch for it's enchanting interactions of human beings which are interesting characters on screen. It mostly involves around the life of a celebrity, an architect, an opera and a married couple and a mom and dad who've come to visit their daughter Hayley(Alison Pill). Along the way strange relationships and interactions are formed as each is still trying to discover his or her self. Alec Baldwin is a okay as John an actor who once lived in Rome and Penelope Cruz is ravishing as a high class international call girl. Overall an okay film to see if you enjoy stories of human interaction and connection it's proves love and discovery are strange and unexpected.",6,3,8,11 July 2012
Bridesmaids," Sexy, funny, outspoken, provocative, feel good comedy that touches your viewing emotions!
","If your looking for a good laugh and want a feel good viewing time then please watch 'Bridesmaids' it's one comedy film that most any would enjoy it's got a blend of emotion and drama to fill any viewer's taste. The film is a please to view for it's funny lines and crazy struggles and mishaps and it's spiced up just right with some sex appeal especially from Kristen Wiig.Set in Wisconsin it involves a in her thirties young lady Annie(good sexy performance from Kristen Wiig)who has hit a tough spot in her life, it all began when her cupcake bakery closed down and she had to then take a job as a ring shop clerk. Only matters get worse as due to Annie's outspoken sarcasm she's fired only making matters even more dark as Annie is cash strapped driving a high mileage rattle trap car, then she's put out of her apartment because she can't pay the bills. The only bright spots that Annie had going for her was looking good in her sexy colored bras(I love the scenes of Kristen in the light blue bra and the pink bra scene rocks!)and having no stings attached sex with any guy! Still all may not be lost she has the chance to be maid of honor at her best friend Lillian's(Maya Rudolph) wedding. Along the way getting to the big day is an emotional and funny ride for Annie and the ladies. A different and unique performance that is eye catching is Melissa McCarthy's turn as a tough and gritty outspoken gal who's just a big lovable squeeze of a bridesmaid.Overall pretty good film to watch plenty of laughs and sex appeal the film is outspoken and emotional with real life drama type of situations and it proves be happy with who you are as in the end you will reach your journey even if it is somewhat of a struggle.",8,5,10,6 February 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A good tale of coming of age, love, lust, mystery and memories.
","I for one have never been a big watcher of the films of Wes Anderson, but I decided to check out his latest 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. Mostly because I saw that the film featured an all pro cast, but after watching I was pleased because the film told a story one about the coming of age of a hotel lobby boy and the changing times of an European country. Told mostly thru flashback by an author the film tells the times of one Gustave H(Ralph Fiennes)and his relationship with a hotel lobby boy at a famous European hotel during the time of social change and wars. All of this drama and journey is tied with lust and involves the mystery of a stolen painting tied to a family fortune. And the chemistry and acting of the cast is top notch with F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tom Wilkinson, and last but not least just to name a few the legendary Bill Murray. Overall good tale of change, suspense and a journey a drama of memories.",8,1,7,12 April 2014
The Favourite," A different take and twist on a historical genre filled with betrayal, power, greed and intimacy.
","'The Favourite' is one film as you watch it does have some historical context, yet it differs in many ways for it's twist of dark heart like comedy and it's very blunt and naughty like with intimate feel. Yet still it's typical 18th century England in times of sibling rivals, war, and the court of the queen and themes of power, greed, and betrayal are so common. Set in the scheme like rabbit filled court of Queen Anne(in a well rounded turn from Olivia Colman) her relationship with Lady Sarah(Rachel Weisz) is just fine until Sarah's cousin Abigail(Emma Stone) arrives then trouble stirs up as a plot of tricks and put downs lurk in the palace. As the old adage always says three is a crowd and this is true for this trio of ladies as the relationships are very toxic and filled with drama and change only wild and naughty like intimacy moves all along so well.Overall the picture is a good spin and twist on loyalty and trust, or not to trust for that matter as charm and being on the throne with the Queen is highly desired in times of war and political difference, it's high drama and a little wicked blood sport of hierarchy. So view this palace as it has plenty to offer.",9,2,8,29 December 2018
Revolutionary Road," An emotional drama of life, love, showing the ups and downs of marriage proving it's a roller coaster ride.
","'Revolutionary Road' an emotional drama and true it's not everyone's cup of tea still the film is well done and enough of an emotional drama to make it a watch for most especially married couples. Based and adapted from Richard Yates's novel director Sam Mendes takes a haunting and close look at marriage in 1950's Connecticut living the American dream in the suburbs. Meet April and Frank Wheeler(and again the chemistry between Winslet and Dicaprio is top notch maybe better than 'Titantic'). And they are the perfect young couple already with two young children. Both have unlimited promise April is an aspiring stage actress and Frank works a good job as a sales rep in the city. Both want big dreams to happen as they plan this after they move into their house on 'Revolutionary Road'. Yet as is so common with many couples they find the struggles of trust and most of all they feel trapped in a world of coded convention. Then it's the lying and the lack of faith and the behind the back cheating that surely enough leads to explosive problems for the Wheelers.Yet April(in one of Kate's strongest performances)wants to start over again by leaving Connecticut for the confines of exotic Paris, France. As expected Frank's heart isn't in it and this leads to extremes especially for April as she will push herself over the edge. Overall I found this nothing great yet, it's worth a watch for the performance of Winslet especially who's very strong and a must see for Kate and Leo fans. Still most couples and especially married ones can relate well to this film as it's proves and shows married life is never easy especially when each see different paths it proves that marriage is clearly a roller coaster ride and no bed of roses.",7,0,1,23 January 2009
Foxcatcher," Real life drama of tragedy brought to the screen just fine, as it shows how ego, passion and greed destroys friendship.
","Finally watched 'Foxcatcher' and I for one was not aware that the film was based on a real life drama that ended tragic, I was to young to remember anyway when it was. You have the real life story in which director Bennett Miller brings to the screen just fine of the Olympic wrestling brother team of one Mark(Channing Tatum)and David Schultz(Mark Ruffalo)who are getting ready to train for the 1988 games in Seoul. And Mark is the younger up and coming stubborn guy who wants to escape out of the shadow of his older straight laced and wise older brother a family man husband and dad David. Oddly enough a strange millionaire makes his appearance that's one strange and lonely odd guy in John E. DuPont(in a wicked and odd transformation role for funny guy Steve Carell)and he lets both Schultz brothers train at his farm like estate and he even lets the guys along with other wrestlers share the estate. And John becomes a father like figure to Mark only slowly but for sure the ego of John takes over as the unlikely relationship was not meant to be as this millionaire lives in one strange world. Overall this film is a great showcase of real life greed, ego, compassion, and the need for friendship in a lonely world as it shows how a mixture of these issues lead to real life tragedy as 'Foxcatcher' is one film that tears a little bit of your viewing heart.",8,6,12,11 December 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Excellent epic a throwback to yesterday of a golden era of culture, fame, struggle and friendship.
","Once again Quentin Tarantino has done it another long and in depth film(almost three hours long for this one!) as the director mixes plot and stories that blend both drama, comedy, and action all in one. Again as is common in any film of Tarantino's is the cast is always all star and a memorable ensemble and it seems the acting and chemistry is always in top form. And this might be the director's finest film to date for it's look back in time to a memorable yesteryear era!'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is set in 1969 at the height and end of Hollywood's golden age an era of free spirits and cultural uprising. It follows the life of one Rick Dalton(in fine form from Leonardo DiCaprio) a past his prime and faded TV actor who now struggles even to get small parts in TV westerns, and Dalton seems hopeless yet he's still friends with his buddy and partner in crime that being his stunt double Cliff Booth(Brad Pitt). The two burn plenty of midnight oil together still a ray of light is found when Rick gets a second chance and a rebirth by doing international pictures and marrying an Italian beauty.In somewhat of a wild card and subplot story Dalton's neighbor is the sexy and young actress Sharon Tate(Margot Robbie) who spices and lightens up the screen as a young star in the making. Also introduced is the strange and notorious Charles Manson. The film even has a surprise and happy ending! Overall excellent well done epic that pays homage to the past as it's a showcase of different stories that connects up with different characters.",10,65,110,27 July 2019
Behind The Candelabra," To much of a good thing is never bad! Michael Douglas shines as the legendary gay figure!
","I always wanted to know the story of Liberace I remember as a young kid when he died of AIDS, I must say that this HBO original movie from Steven Soderbergh captures the life story almost perfect. The film called 'Behind the Candelabra' is based some on the autobiographical novel of the 6 year relationship between the yours truly and the much younger lover Scott Thorson. Starting in 1977 at the height of Liberace's fame and popularity a young ranch and farm hand in Northern California a young bisexual man named Scott Thorson(Matt Damon)is able to meet Liberace in Las Vegas thru one of his gay connections. And soon after attending more and more of the legendary pianist concerts and events young Scott is taken under the wings and seduction spell of the fabulous and flamboyant pianist called the one and only Liberace(in a beautiful and shining performance from Michael Douglas). This love affair would last nearly 6 years the relationship comes to it's highest points in Liberace's Las Vegas mansion. Going all the way thru the couple's rocky times when Liberace cheated on Scott with a younger man till the legendary musician's death of AIDS in early 1987 this is one autobiographical film that can't be missed as it goes behind the scenes of a legendary gay relationship it's a historical shine.",9,0,2,14 January 2014
Gone Girl," A film that is a tease with hype and suspense drama with a deviant twist.
","If you know anything about the movies of David Fincher you know they are different, strange, and dark with twist as he gives clues and then twist happen that you may or may not expect. With this latest 'Gone Girl' which is based on a best selling novel it's a good suspense mystery tease. The acting and chemistry is top notch with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as married couple Nick and Amy. It seems as if they are the power couple as they have money, love and success from their writing jobs as both are educated with wit and books. Still behind the scenes lies drama and hidden skeletons in the closets of both and when the 5 year anniversary hits Amy vanishes from their home, and strange clues are left behind and then the hype and drama builds thru the police and media around the case as people think that Nick killed and did away with his wife! Fincher does a good job of drawing the film out with discovery and drama build up as it leads to more tension and much of the film is told thru flashback. Only this picture takes a twist that you may or may not like I don't want to reveal to much it proves that life and blood is thicker than water and also that people are deviant and life is complex and strange with love and desire.",8,0,6,4 October 2014
Django Unchained," Raw, violent, wicked and wild revenge wild west style, yet a shoot em' up black Tony style.
","Most of Quentin Tarantino's works are well done and they push the limit often paying homage to B list cinema and underground works with the director often putting a stamp of violence and outrageous scenes in most of his works and 'Django Unchained' is no different! The film is blended with raw humor and wicked scenes of blood and violence which were set in the slave days of the deep south. Here Tarantino takes the slave theme to the max ending in all out war and revenge. Yet the story is entertaining and clever you have a well to do dentist Dr. King Schultz(the terrific veteran Christoph Waltz)who goes rogue and becomes a bounty hunter and he acts underneath as a slave freedom crusader. As Dr. Schultz purchases a young but rough and rugged slave named Django(Jamie Foxx)who in return for freedom will work with the doctor to hunt down wanted rich and evil slave owners. Yet a prize awaits for Django in the end as the goal is to rescue his slaved wife Broomhilda(Kerry Washington). And the journey is interesting with plenty of blood, guts, and violence thru the south and rural dirty roads that lead to the big house of the arrogant and rich big time Mississippi plantation owner mister Calvin Candie(in a to the max and well acted role by Leonardo DiCaprio). Overall this film may not be everyone's cup of tea yet take away the outspoken and brash talk and the blood and guts it teaches you life, liberty, and freedom and that's okay even if it is in a revengeful form.",6,6,13,30 December 2012
Get Out," A mix and blend of horror and drama a social mind spin.
","Finally saw 'Get Out' one of the most talked about movies of 2017 and I must say this work from director Jordan Peele was interesting as it's a take on society and a spin on race and class as it's blended with themes and elements of drama and horror and the film twist with suspense it's a real guesser and almost mind numbing.The story is that of an interracial couple Chris(newcomer Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose(Allison Williams from 'HBO's' 'Girls') who one weekend drive to visit the well to do parents of Rose. And from the start Chris feels out of place even though Rose swears that her parents are not against black people. Still all of the hired help and servants are black it seems like slave days. And the talk and questions used around Chris make him uncomfortable.Then strange happenings begin is it real or is just Chris seeing things? This film has you thinking too, as it's a plague as it's like Chris is falling deeper and deeper into this secret society as his entire mind and world is changing. Really this picture is a strange and different style of horror suspense drama that twist with a spin of race and social themes.",8,14,27,20 December 2017
The Theory of Everything," A compelling and educational love story drama that's a restrain but loving romance.
","I for one was never no math geek or a big book worm, still I thought it would be good to check out the Stephen Hawking biography, and I was glad I did as 'The Theory of Everything' it's a fine romance drama of patience and love. It tells of Stephen's early days of him trying to prove the black hole theory and it starts with his meeting of the cute and bright Jane the woman who would later become his wife. Mostly the film shows a lot about the work and times of accomplishment of the famous physicist, yet it's most touching and hard to take scenes are showing how the motor neuron disease destroys and cripples the body of one Stephen. I must say the role of Stephen Hawking is played just wonderful by Eddie Redmayne his speech restrain and movement scenes in his bound wheelchair though tough to watch are played to near perfection by Eddie and the performance from Felicity Jones as Jane from her girlfriend to wife days are just adorable. This is a film that shows life is full of unexpected things from the mind to the function or dysfunction of the body, yet still it can't destroy love, relationship, or thought.",8,1,2,15 December 2014
P.S. I Love You," Funny romantic comedy with flashbacks that makes us all want to figure out the world of love, life, and relationships.
","'P.S. I Love You' is certainly a pretty funny and touching romantic comedy that leaves the viewer with laughs while mostly the story of gone love is told by flashbacks. Yet the film proves a point that love, relationships, and happiness is always a constant search. Really the big negative on the film is that really no chemistry is developed or so it seems with the central characters. You have Hilary Swank in a decent performance as Holly Kennedy a woman married to hunky Irish singer Gerry(Gerard Butler). Holly is depressed because her big hobby is collecting shoe heels while she desperately wants a baby, yet her hubby is playing hard yet both still passionately and strongly love one another. Suddenly despite Gerry's good looks and life the films take a massive twist all of a sudden switching to his death brought on by an apparent brain tumor? Then for the next year the theme is love only by love letters that were written by Gerard before his death, the chemistry of the present is so little as Holly daydreams so much getting much of her pleasure by remembering and flashbacks. Yet the movie has much wit and funny one liners the acting from Hilary was well done and Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon provide witty laughs as Hilary's best friends Denise and Sharon one a husband hunter and the other an expecting mother respectively. The biggest and most hidden strong point of the film is the direct and caring performance from Kathy Bates as Patricia which is Hilary's mother. And Hilary provides some sexy and funny scenes and just to mention Harry Connick Jr. gives a likable performance as Holly's potential love interest. Overall nothing special not really enough chemistry or enough deep character development, but still watchable proving that in life and love the unexpected happens and that one should try and cherish every moment especially when one has it. As the film proves when one is searching and trying to rediscover love it's many times an ongoing search that we all just try to still figure out and search for happiness and new discovery. With most importantly breaking away from a gripped love hold past.",6,3,7,22 December 2007
Room," A film that shows how shelter and surroundings differ, especially when a boy becomes open to the outside world!
",'Room' is certainly one of the most compelling and interesting drama movies of this year the plot and story is just so different and complex. The film is a harrowing tale of a young boy named Jack(beautiful work from Jacob Tremblay)who along with his Ma(Brie Larson)is trapped and confined for many years in an enclosed room with a 10-by-10-foot space to live in. Thru it all Ma coaches and cares for Jack along the way by reading him stories and singing him songs and putting him to bed with warm love and food. It just goes to show what it's like and how a person must make it when their life is a shelter away from the norm and society. Then all of a sudden the second half of the film takes a spin a twist as when the two escape an outside world is discovered by the little boy and mom. As the grandparents of Jack are found the loving yet tough accepting Nancy(Joan Allen)and Robert(William H. Macy). Most revealing and different is how little Jack sees an open world of sight and sound as it's an adjustment it's clearly not what he was use to with Ma. Overall this film proves that each and everyone leads their own little sheltered life in their own way and world. And true when one ventures out a new world of sight and sound and mind is discovered as each world and room for that matter is of different sight and it gives off a different feel for everyone. 'Room' is one drama that sets free the character and viewer to discovery of new sight and to a new look of life.,8,1,9,24 November 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," Raw and gritty a mix of crime and media sensation .
","Anyone knows that the 70's had much different films that were made they were blunt, open, and honest as directors like Sidney Lumet pushed the envelope. Based on a real life case from 1972 this picture shot almost like a news live or documentary style way shows courage and desperation on a hot sunny Brooklyn afternoon as two determined unknowns Sonny(Al Pacino in a shout out stand up performance!) and Sal(John Cazale) one the leader the second the follower decide to holdup a bank only to have things take a turn for disaster.Now enter the cops, crowds, TV cameras and even pizza deliverymen and you have a swarm of drama and decision this film clearly has raw and different vibes of energy as it's a fine entry of 70's film and Al's performance is in top notch form as this go against the grain film is a renegade classic!",8,1,1,3 September 2019
The Game," One of the best films of 1997. Mind thrilling with fun entertainment and suspense!
","Of all the films I saw in the year 1997, this 'The Game' with Michael Douglas has to be one of the best. Because really you don't see any complex plot twist, and the the film is thrilling and suspenseful with a hard and direct pressed acting performance from Douglas. I really too liked the story and thrilling mood from director David Fincher. You have Michael Douglas as millionaire businessman financier Nicholas Van Orton who's very successful yet he's lonely and carries a very uptight personality while living in his San Francisco mansion. So one day younger brother the more liberal and free spirited Conrad(Sean Penn) gives Nicholas a birthday present a gift card from a corporate company called consumer recreation services(CRS) for as Conrad says the experience and pleasure of a lifetime that this game will add all the fun and entertainment to your life that's missing. So Nicholas tries the service out, and one by one his life starts to get creepy, unpredictable, and very strange in very unusual ways. Many of the moments and scenes are memorable from his talking TV developing it's own voice, the clown left in front of his home entrance, to his meeting of a sexy blonde waitress Christine(Deborah Kara Unger)and most of all his taxi cab one night takes a plunge off the golden gate bridge! This nonsense starts to drive him crazy as the worry starts to make him wonder if he will end up like his father and meet a tragic end the past haunts him so much. Only to find out how it ends is strange and simple it really surprises the viewer the first time they watch. Overall really a fine done film with good acting from Douglas and the story was a neat concept from Fincher with thrills and fun suspense and in it's day this film might have been a glimpse into the future form of identity theft. Anyway 'The Game' still entertains and it's clearly one of 1997's best.",8,6,9,2 November 2007
Ghostbusters," Who you gonna call? 'Ghostbusters'! One of the best comedy and sci-fi films of all time a feel good and well remembered film!
","Growing up as a small kid in the early and mid 80's I remember when this film came out and the crazy feel and fever it started. It had everyone going around saying in 1984 'Who you gonna Call'? 'Ghostbusters'! And clearly without a doubt 1984's 'Ghostbusters' was one of the most memorable and better known films of the 1980's, as it's a sci-fi comedy that's feel good and well remembered. As it was well written with smarts and wit still the funny one liners and comedic parts are often overshadowed by the well remembered ghosts(green ghost slimmer) and monsters(the stay puff marshmallow man) of the film.Also well directed by Ivan Reitman the plot is pretty good as it is set in New York City and it features three college professors of parapsychology named Dr. Venkman(Bill Murray)Dr. Stanz(Dan Aykroyd) and Dr. Spengler(Harold Ramis)who all of a sudden find themselves out of a job as the university starts to downsize as they have cut their study department due to lack of interest and the mid 80's recession of the bad economy. Yet never fear an ideal has sprung to mind just like it did with all great minds from Einstein to Gallo, and Pluto the trio decide to open up a business and go the entrepreneurial route as they specialize in everything from chasing ghosts and unappetizing apparitions. Also a good supporting role is given from the elegant and classy Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barret a single woman who even discovers her apartment's refrigerator door has became the door for the gates of hell! And thru the film it's interesting and memorable with funny one liners and chase scenes of strange ghost, yet thru it all the 'Ghostbusters' will conquer all of New York City from the ghastly ghost and make it safe again in this very funny haunting action comedy. Well remembered film at a time that features the comedy trio of Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis in their prime and in top form and the lovable and cute ghost like green slimmer and stay puff are very memorable images of joy and fun. Overall one of the better feel good comedy films of the 80's a real treat.",10,5,7,7 June 2009
Call Me by Your Name," A movie of coming to terms with life, love and discovery of one's self identity.
","I for typically from time to time watch movies that are gay love stories so I decided to check out this latest relationship drama 'Call Me by Your Name'. Set in Italy in 1983 this film is about growth and coming to terms with life, love and discovery of identity. Elio(in a good turn from Timothee Chalamet) is a young man who enjoys summer, reading books, and good food, and learning and living culture, along with being with friends and this Lacoste shirt wearing young man is about to have his world changed when Oliver(Armie Hammer)visits to be Elio's father research assistant.Along the way the two hit it off and slowly, but surely one thing leads to another as the two make out and learn and feel each other out. It's like Oliver has taken Elio under his wing both emotionally and mentally. Overall this movie proves that love is different and uncommon and it can be magic and enjoyed, yet when it's over it can be painful and affect life.",7,0,1,22 January 2018
Gran Torino," A powerful performance from the iconic Eastwood, his character inspires and he proves that anyone can come to terms to an unexpected friendship.
","Clint Eastwood the man the tough guy himself certainly is in top form here with his latest 'Gran Torino' which perhaps could be his final screen role, considering he's close to approaching the age of 80 years old. And after you watch this you will feel as fresh as ever and happy with Clint's performance as his manner is as gruff and as macho as ever. Only on this journey you see how no matter how gruff that this old man can humble when it comes to the ways of the world and can develop new and unlikely friendships.Eastwood is Walt Kowalski a Korean war vet who lives in Michigan and after retiring as an auto worker and upon the passing of his wife, the world has certainly darkened for Walt. Yet Walt is a tough natured type of a guy one who's wise with wisdom and he lives with his most prized possession a 1972 'Gran Torino' yet mostly his gruff and tough nature is the eye catcher that most see about him including family. Yet the film theme turns social when it shows the nature of racism. From the start you the viewer see with Walt's actions(tobacco chewing) and tough witty talk(racial slang and jokes)that he's clearly a bigot and has plenty of stubborn blood flowing in him. And when a Hmong family moves in next door this is when Walt's life and character is tested the most.It is here we see that film takes on a complex and tough grumble journey of a process of character transformation. And the theme of racism is so common as so many of us have dealt with it in our lives in some form. Even though the undercurrent and subplot of the neighborhood gang issues and the violence of the film shows a side of Eastwood's character to be somewhat of a local superhero to the family, it still fails in comparison to the films message of learning to accept a new take on friendship. The development and growth you see in many of the scenes between Eastwood and Bee Vang(good supporting work)grow on your thoughts and emotions. As after seeing this film it leaves everyone with the hope of a better world proving that all of us no matter what racial, ethnic, or cultural background are the same and bleed the same blood. Really it's a hope for a better world showing that unlikely friendships can develop and that even the most stubborn and strongest types of people(Kowalski) can have a change of heart and view the world differently and change before they pass on.Overall wonderful work from Eastwood maybe one of his strongest, yet his performances are always well done with class and perfection. It's a must see here for the fact that this could be the legends last screen time perhaps. And too for the strong message that this film sends of looking at friendship and growing to change one's ways in such an unblinking way makes it very powerful and certainly a film to be respected. So 'Gran Torino' in my view is certainly one film that drove into the winners circle.",9,2,5,9 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Explosive war film that's not really political, yet more directly personal and situational.
","Finally watched 'The Hurt Locker' after hearing about all the buzz the film has caused. And you can see why the picture has caused a stir for one it's an explosive and thrilling war film of very dangerous situations. It's themes though centered around war stays away from political influence as it's focus was the direct and gritty action of bomb explosives in war. And most scenes shot were harrowing and explosive to the eye as the direction and camera work from director Kathryn Bigelow was top notch.Set in 2004 in Iraq it centers around the lives and everyday happenings of an elite and highly trained bomb disarming unit. And the viewer is always treated to the bomb disarming during the extreme heat of combat. Right from the get go you can see this is a highly stressful and nerve rattling job, only the strong survive as the margin for error is little to zero. You see this so well displayed by the tough and gritty staff Sergeant James(Jeremy Renner in a good performance) who leads the unit learning each what it means to keep both your body and soul intact.What more can I say 'The Hurt Locker' is powerful and realistic in showing very intense and action packed scenes. As it will keep you the viewer on the edge of your seat each time that another bomb is about to be disarmed. In the end it proves that war is like an addictive drug and that many were meant to be war warriors, as this is one memorable war film that doesn't have a big political theme yet it's situations of direct brutal and heart stopping reality clearly shows the true and real memorable nature of war time to be gritty and heart pounding.",7,2,6,1 February 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Enchanting and wonderful fairy tale of an extraordinary man who lives a rather ordinary life in both moments of drama and unexpected love. And he lives it all in reverse!
","'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' though a fairy tale film of wonder, excitement and joys of unexpected moments broadens it's themes more in depth by showing the joys of life and love. Adapted from a short story from F. Scott Fitzgerald the direction from David Fincher(one who's known for his dark thrillers like:'Seven')is beautiful as many scenes were done so well with the wizard of computer magic and top notch camera work. Yet most catching of all is it's message proving that each have an expected path in life everybody has a fate. Yet this the main character lives his in a most unusual way he lives it backwards! Just imagine escaping the norm as we are so use to living and being in existence from birth being young and living life till our old body gives out. Only how about trying it in reverse! This film has star Brad Pitt(Benjamin Button) who's born as an 80 year old and during his life span he ages backwards all the way to an infant. Yet from the beginning of his start in New Orleans at the doorstep of an old folks home his life spans thru the years from his meeting of people and friends to travels and journeys of memories that anyone would cherish.Beginning with Button's friendship early on when he befriends a little female Daisy(wonderful performance from Cate Blanchett)and many years later as Benjamin starts to gain his youth he once again meets up with Daisy along the way after she's became a successful ballet dancer and the two will develop a passionate romance and love story that anyone would dream of it was just so true and simple.The film even though long moves well with it's journey of drama and life discovery for Benjamin as it's memorable for his working and making a living on a tugboat. And his first love and his being seduced by an elegant and sophisticated married lady(played gracefully by Tilda Swinton). The film is clearly a journey of life's common ups and downs that are common for all yet this man's story of age and living is most uncommon.Overall this film is a masterpiece of joy told thru flashback it's a real taste of a historical journey of love, drama, and changing and most of all it shows to be happy with yourself no matter what. It's fairy tale and magic theme is well enjoyed as the wonder and thrill to see of how one can age backwards and still enjoy life, have success and discover love is amazing. Remember everyone is different, it's okay to be different and everyone lives and does life in a different way. That's what this epic masterpiece of a film shows it's clearly an emotional, and touching picture to love for the way it shows how life can be in a different order yet still it shows that it can be memorable.",10,14,24,26 December 2008
1917," Well shot film with it's focus of message, courage, will, and determination thru grave means.
","Saw many war pictures and each have a different take, and story with each director filming a different way. This War War 1take '1917' from director Sam Mendes is a single camera gazed straight shot that has a focus of travel and journey that being the destination of two British soldiers. The background shows war is hell as along the path you see dead rats and human remains like skeletons caked in the mud all sacrificed from blood and glory. Both soldiers have been dispatched to deliver an urgent message to some other 1600 soldiers that being a trap by the Germans. So maybe the British might rethink about a war attack otherwise.Thru the journey you see the village of war is a no man's land from booby traps to riverbanks alone. Still the two have hope even though fear and doubt is forever present. The film is moving it really holds as the images stick in your mind along with this journey as the images and travels speak a message of emotions as it's clear this work has it's images to speak louder than words.",8,0,1,11 January 2020
Lincoln," An epic historical and political film of compromise, compassion, and sacrifice.
","I for one am a history and political buff and I've read and researched 'Honest Abe' well so it was nice and only fitting to see a big screen film of Lincoln's life. Oddly it comes from director Steven Spielberg who's branched out to more serious fare like a historical drama of this matter. Also this is not a biography of the well known and popular president. It's focus is in 1865 the last months of his presidency just after his reelection as the civil war is about to end, yet more important on Abe's radar is wanting to pass the 13th amendment thru congress so the slaves could be free thru the south and north. This film shows the blood and bodies that were fallen and shed during the civil war, yet it's focus is much more of political drama and back room dealing with compromise and words while trying to end slavery.The film's detail and scenes and background shots are top notch and the performances and acting is A plus all the way it's an acting clinic especially Daniel Day Lewis who's a real spitting image of Abe Lincoln his voice and actions are southern yet done professor like mixed with human good and knowledge that can't be matched. Honest Abe as this film shows was a man and a president of thought and good nature who always thought about his next plans and treated all as equal he was a president who clearly wanted the slaves to be free, that's why his commissioners fought so hard with opposing politicians to get the 13th amendment passed. A real standout of the film is veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones(one of the best actors around)as republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens an outspoken and direct speak his mind politician who sides with Abe on the slavery issue. Aside from the back room drama of political showrooms and fancy speeches and yes and no arguments, this film shows that the Lincoln's were troubled people too. Sally Field is a shattered lady while giving a raw performance as Lincoln's troubled wife Mary Todd her emotions really came out on screen. As both were always troubled with their young son Willie's death. And to complicate matters oldest living son Robert(Joseph Gordon Levitt)wants to go off to fight for the union.Overall this film is more than a history or political memory of a great man or president and the performances of Daniel, Sally, and Tommy make it a must see as cast chemistry is unmatched most of all this important film proved that in life, war, and politics things must be done with grace, compassion, and most of all you must be willing to compromise and sacrifice for the sake and good for all human nature no matter what race or sex.",8,3,11,18 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The end of an era?! A new begining or passing of the torch?
",I see all of the 'Star Wars' movies even though I think that the franchise is getting overblown and to expanded as the originals from the 70's and 80's had more tradition and the characters seemed more original. As now the saga seems ever changing and with more leaving and only a few of the old heads remain!(Note my favorite is the wookie a bigfoot spin off as the mighty 'Chewbacca' is still in the 'Star Wars' universe!).Really the latest entry 'The Last Jedi' is just a look into the growth of Rey(Daisy Ridley)as she's has developed into a Jedi with the help from old legend Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) with conflict and drama that involves the evil Kylo Ren(Adam Driver) and along to see the on going battle of the first order and the resistance is Princess Leia(in the late Carrie Fisher's last role).Overall this just didn't hold my interest still it's a 'Star Wars' story that continues the battles of the galaxy with old and new era characters as the need for new Jedi's are always needed to fight space evil.,7,3,15,26 December 2017
The Evil Dead," A cult classic of blood, guts, and evil possesion.
","Finally after all these years watched 'The Evil Dead' and indeed it's a cult classic horror film that proves a low budget and cheaply shot film can deliver fear and frights in under 90 minutes! Look for some of the early work of veteran character Bruce Campbell.The story is simple a group of Michigan college kids travel to the rural Tennessee woods to stay inside a wooded cabin to do the usual of partying and have sex, however the discovery of an old cryptic like book and audio tapes change the game plan! It turns out this is now a demon party of possession as evil spirits invade the woods and enter the cabin.Most of the scenes are gore and wicked with blood and just downright scary! As the dead are trying to overtake the living one by one as their rotten souls now inhabit each and every body in the cabin and along the woods. Overall a cult horror classic one of the best ever made with plenty of blood, gore, guts, and horror fun.",9,0,1,4 November 2018
The Piano," May not be everyone's cup of tea, yet it's subtle and sentimental enough for a watch.
","These days I'm use to seeing Holly Hunter on TV as a raw and sexy bad girl bed hopping cop in 'Saving Grace' So clearly that's made me a fan of hers. Holly is a fine actress so it was only fitting that I watch the 1993 film 'The Piano' that she starred in and won an Oscar for best actress. I must say the performance was good and the type of character she played made it award material. Still I found this film a little slow moving, maybe it was because of her characters disability. Anyway her inspiration and sentimental feel make it a watch.Set in 1850's New Zeland Hunter is Ada a young woman who's mute and her biggest passion in life is playing the piano. Conflict will arise in Ada's life as her husband(Sam Neill)will cross ways with his intense neighbor(Harvey Keitel). Only Ada's husband will find out that she and her piano playing has turned on their neighbor not only emotionally but sexually also. Tense passions of erotic feel and love erupts. Only in the end the true passion will be seen as the piano was her one true love that will last. Not really a great film in my book it's a watch for Hunter fans, and it's point is proved that a person can have more of a lasting love with an object or instrument more than they can with a person.",6,1,3,2 April 2009
Paranormal Activity," Well done self made film of shadows and sounds that teases and entertains.
","I must saying that after seeing this film it was pretty much a treat to watch it. Even though I didn't let the images and shadows and sounds get to me like those others in the crowd, yet that's expected of teenagers. Anyway 'Paranormal Activity' may not be a good old fashion gore feast of blood and guts, still it's just spooky enough with it's images and sounds to keep a viewer interested and on the edge of your seat. As it's true many times as legendary director John Carpenter said it's not what you see that scares you the most, but what you don't see that's coming around the corner that frightens you the most.The film stars a young married couple who go by their real life names as they neither are well known stars you have Katie and Micah who live in a suburban San Diego, California home. The couple's use of a hand held camera moves and paces the film along well as everything is told from their points of view. As they record nearly everything from their conversations to the visits of friends. Yet the main purpose that they use this recording device is to document the strange happenings that they feel is going on in their home as they feel are ghostly and one expert even tells them it is a problem with demons. As the tape rolls on all during the night hours of filming the couple's tossing and turning in bed in which many of us do unaware.And to keep viewers on the edge of their seats this night footage shows strange shadows creeping under the cover, you see doors slam hear groans and moans with wicked screams! These strange things cause fear for both Kate and Micah even one scene takes you back to your childhood nightmares as the under the bed monster(that you knew as a kid)drags Kate underneath pulling her away from bed! What more must I say I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it as you find out what a shocking twist it takes in the end.'Paranormal Activity' is certainly a well done film that's interesting and gets the viewers attention for the way it was made and self paced with suspense that you don't really see. This film probably will be a cult independent classic that stands the test of time for years.",7,5,10,24 October 2009
Black Snake Moan," Good tale of the blues.
","I have to say that 'Black Snake Moan' is a pretty powerful film though it's tough, gritty, and shows sadness and sorrow it shows what the blues is all about and lets it get to our souls. Set in the rural deep south in a small town atmosphere a young girl named Rae(Christina Ricci) who's been abused and mistreated sexually as a kid is now a young adult who's turned into a white trash trailer park slut who's sleazy and very sexually experienced. The pain starts again when Rae's boyfriend gets called off to fight in war as Ronnie(Justin Timberlake)goes away. Then on the other side enter Lazarus a man who's feeling his pain after his wife has left him for another man the blues are coming down upon him. Then one day Lazarus makes a discovery of a badly beaten up Rae along the countryside and he decides to take her in. And what will develop is a very strange and somewhat odd love relationship really a tough and gritty bond of friendship. Yet in the end an understanding and love respect for the blues is developed as both Rae and Lazarus learn to take sadness from one another and grow it into happiness and maturity slowly. The performances are tremendous from Jackson and Ricci as Samuel is tough and fiery plus Ricci is very erotic and sexy in a trashy and dirt way. Overall one of the more underrated films of 2006.",7,2,4,18 February 2008
Silence," A film of faith, will, believe, and determination to fight for the word.
","I've been a watcher of Martin Scorsese movies and this one for sure is a little different, it's a religious theme film still it's an interesting journey of travel and courage a search that involves will it's a freedom seeking mission. Set in 16 century Japan two priests named Rodrigues(Andrew Garfield)and Garrpe(Adam Driver)arrive in the land of the rising sun to look for and find their mentor Ferreira(Liam Neeson). However this journey travel will turn out to be much more than a search it's also a crusade to help start catholic faith in a country where it's forbidden and soon this picture becomes a film of struggle, persecution, and ridicule, a test of faith and will as these two young priests slowly start to feel like they are the real outlaws. Overall this film will not be everyone's cup of tea still it's a good look at culture, faith, believe, and fighting for what one believes in.",7,1,4,14 January 2017
The Insider," An in depth and provocative and compelling legal emotional drama that fights for answers while wanting a search for justice.
","Finally after many years watched Michael Mann's legal drama 1999's 'The Insider' and it was clearly a well done legal drama that searches for answers and blows the whistle on those in power who try to hide corruption that blends greed and power. The film recounts a chain of events that pitted a guy against the giant tobacco industry. And this film would really be in depth and drag the characters thru a fight of their lives.Al Pacino(still one of the best actors in the business)is in top form with a strong performance as veteran '60 Minutes' producer Lowell Bergman and Russell Crowe(is the man affected by it all the insider himself former tobacco executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand). The story is pretty cut and dry when Wigand is fired by the tobacco company, he agrees to become a paid consultant for a story that Bergman and '60 Minutes' is working on about the unethical ways within the tobacco industry. This all leads to a long battle between all with a lot of legal cat and mouse games which puts everyone's reputations on the line.As expected the tobacco industry will use any legal and corporate means they can to help save a billion dollar a year habit. Still both Bergman and Wigand are fighters that are searching for answers and they want justice in the form of truth as with every little bit more evidence is uncovered.Cleraly this is a harrowing drama with legal and emotional twist and turns it has an in depth cold hard edge that keeps you glued while searching for answers and fighting for the truth with twist. 'The Insider' was for sure one of Michael Mann's better made films.",9,3,3,17 May 2016
The Dark Knight," Excellent work from Nolan. And made even better with Ledger's psychotic yet decisive turn as the Joker.
","'The Dark Knight' which is the sequel to Christopher Nolan's 2005 'Batman Begins' clearly without question is a much better film as it goes deeper into the dark mind of both the superhero('Batman') and the villain('The Joker'). The action and drama in the film is nonstop and you as the viewer will find it interesting and exciting. Yet most of all as I just mentioned unlike many comic book films of the past which have been kids stuff this is a film that shows the darkness of human nature proving that good and evil are just a short distance away from one another.When you have such great talent on a set like Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, Caine, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal with the serious psychological direction you clearly know that a film of this type is out to prove that it's fun and full of character struggles with all of it boiling to epic showdowns. Nolan makes the film very lengthy to try and wrap it all together, yet as bat fans know no matter how much you try to get across this saga will always be an epic that continues really my only negative of the film was the long length. As for everything else I loved the way that Nolan explored the conflict and dark minds of both 'Batman' and the 'Joker'. Plus his subplot that involved the 'Harvey Dent' character and for his new approach of how the creation of 'Two-Face' became was interesting and neat.You find Gotham the same only this time 'The Joker'(Heath Ledger)is robbing banks in the city, yet his main plan is to overthrow and control all of the city's underworld workings. Here we find 'The Joker' shown in a much different form than in the past. This is an evil villain with smeared makeup who was deeply hurt by his father and it was different seeing the clown prince having a weapons choice of a knife. Ledger takes the character to new psychotic heights in fact this performance from him rivals more like a turn to the 'Alex' character in a 'Clockwork Orange'. I still favor the 1989 performance from legendary great Jack Nicholson who took the 'Joker' role over the top with a mixture of camp and humor that still lead to majestic vanity, yet still this crazy freak turn from Ledger was great work for the way he did it with such maniacal grace. Heath certainly saved his best performance for last.Bale is once again in top form as 'Batman' who yet again is a conflicted man trying to clean up Gotham even though an element of camp is shown in the film when it shows the city is running with copycat 'Batmans'. The love interest is still Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal who's a big upgrade over Katie Holmes)only the moonlight shift has caused a break in the romance so Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart)moves in to steal both types of thunder first the romancing of Rachel then he's out to shine as the city's crime fighting DA. Underneath all the conflict and drama the best man to see thru the corruption in the complex world is Lt. James Gordon(Gary Oldman). During all the drama and action and corruption the subplot and twist of Dent becoming 'Two-Face' happens quickly which wasn't really necessary as this film's central theme is a hero who has to battle with darkness in his own mind and heart.So overall what more can I say on many levels this is the best 'Batman' movie ever made. As Nolan clearly accomplished a lot with his direction of showing how even a hero can be very conflicted and complicated yet still must fight the darkness and be the heart that shines for justice and protection against evil and corruption. Sadly it's a shame that Ledger didn't live to see this work of success in which he as a dark wild card character helped blaze the film to a glorious victory. Heath's performance is one of the best in film history, and 'The Dark Knight' in my opinion is one of the greatest films ever made.",10,3,8,20 July 2008
Friends with Benefits," A feel good and enjoyable sex romp! It proves good sex is a benefit it leads to attachment and possible love!
","I have to say that watching 'Friends with Benefits' is one feel good time of a watch! The film is very sexy and it's blended with humor and emotional attachment. And it showcases how more and more relationships have become and that is it's just all sex with no strings attached! That's something that most of us younger folk enjoy, still we get arguments that we all need love and relationships, yet this film proves that great sex alone can lead to attachment and the chance for love! This film even though it proves that romance can be obtained thru sex, it bucks the typical trend of Hollywood romantic comedies. It showcases plenty of fun loving erotic scenes of bed hopping and good old fashioned sex! In New York City Jamie(the hot and very sexy Mila Kunis)a young up and coming magazine executive who's just broken off a relationship hires a young hotshot from sunny California Dylan(Justin Timberlake who hams it up in this role)and this young stud is also single. It's upon his arrival to New York City the two hit it off and they agree from the start that this will only be a relationship of sex! The bed climbing eventually becomes tiresome, still it's fun and different from the norm you as the viewer will eat it up.Good supporting turns are given along the way in the form of Tommy(Woody Harrelson)a gay magazine staff office worker, and veteran Patricia Clarkson is funny and sexy as Jamie's cougar and alcoholic mother Lorna, while TV actress Jenna Elfman is a bright smile as Dylan's big sister Annie. Along the way while dealing with family and relationship problems both Jamie and Dylan see that sex can lead to attachment then that grows to feelings and then a chance for love. This proves that having fun in the process gives anyone a chance for something special.Many may take from this romantic/sex comedy that you learn as you go and that the benefits of sex are good it's a fun process. As it shows in the end it opens up a new beginning for a relationship of love and attachment. Now that's something we could all hope for and hopefully more sex and more bed hopping will lead to these kind of endings.",8,2,6,27 July 2011
Into the Wild," Wonderful. A journey of discovery and escape, it proves that happiness is best when shared.
","I must say that 'Into the Wild' is a great movie one of the most touching and inspirational films in a long time that will touch your heart and emotions. The film is done in such a beautiful manner for the way it shows how journey and nature spellbinds and becomes amazingly personal to a young man in search of escape and discovery of happiness. 'Into the Wild' is inspired by a true story and the screenplay and directing both was brilliantly done by acting veteran Sean Penn, though it may seem long and drawn out to some the film moves at a pace that travels you along for the right amount of time for each adventure and discovery and the meetings of new people that this young man encounters.Set in 1990 after graduation from college straight A student Chris McCandless(Emile Hirsch)decides finally he must abandon his life of spoiled privilege and comfort from his wealthy and sheltered parents Billie(Marcia Gay Harden)and Walt(William Hurt)by making a cross country journey to discover freedom of life on the road that's full of adventures, rejecting reason, and meeting new people and most of all having new joys and being happy. All along the main goal of Chris is to reach and settle down in the Alaskan wilderness. Along the way this film is told stirring and steady by the use of flashbacks and told by the narration of his sister Carine. Along the way the fun and enjoyment of natures beauty which was inspired to Chris by reading the works of Jack London fails in comparison to his meeting of new people and friends. Catherine Keener gives a good turn as a likable hippie and biker type gal Jan, and Vince Vaughn is a treat as Wayne the hard working common man farmer in South Dakota. Last but not least the most important encounter for Chris is in the California dessert community when he encounters wisdom and learns faith from an old man Ron Franz(Hal Holbrook is terrific here). Proving most of all that life is about new people, discoveries and learning to be happy and feeling good about sharing.When the journey finally ends and he deceases in the Alaskan wilderness in August of 1992 this young man had seen the light of life and learned faith and wisdom while he rejected phony reasons and the hidden lies of his family life. Overall 'Into the Wild' is a very touching and moving film a great viewing to uplift your spirits and have you feeling the need for your own personal journey to discover new people and to find happiness. The pacing and direction of the film is top notch from Penn while the scenes of Hirsch and Holbrook together are touching and wonderfully emotional. Again this film proves happiness is best when shared it's a must view one of the best movies made in a long time.",10,2,6,31 March 2008
Annie Hall," Funny and witty romantic comedy. That has nice flashbacks and intelligent dialogue.
","To me 1977's 'Annie Hall' is nothing great, it's just really an okay picture a romantic comedy with laughs and wit. I guess though one must hand it to Woody Allen for the way he done the film by telling the struggles of relationships in life and for his comparing of situations to the use of flashbacks to draw references. This film shows the differences between male and female ways, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent with references often to art and pop culture and Allen isn't afraid to show that most of these characters have strong liberal beliefs in dealing with social and political matters. My favorite line is masturbation is I love myself! The acting performances are good with Allen as a neurotic and nervous New York city comedian Alvy Singer who finds enjoyment finally with love by romancing a woman named Annie Hall a city club singer. I must say that Diane Keaton gave a bold and strong independent performance here with this role of Annie. Really this isn't the greatest film made, but it's good with a unique and intelligent take from Allen for the way he did it by flashbacks, monologues, one-liners, and even cartoon animation really a wacky way to showcase love and romance.",7,1,2,8 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Well done imagery. A film that was well made during it's time period(1968).
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' made in 1968 is a film that really done a good job to show a glimpse into the future the imagery, and scenes with special effects are beautiful another thumbs up for Stanley Kubrick. The special effects shown are super making one feel that space is a magical place, and Kubrick even played with the viewer when the screen goes totally black with the music playing as the viewers mind starts to wonder. And from the start by showing the dawn of civilization with the apes this film started with a message to show how times and history changes man and especially the future of technology just remember up in space the talking computer! Really a wonderful made film for the year 1968, it did a good job by showing how some of the future would be especially the rise of technology and how dependent that man became on it. A film of great visual image and effect.",7,0,2,29 June 2007
Blood Diamond," A civil war of blood.
","'Blood Diamond' overall is a movie with a meaning of more than diamond trading or smuggling, but it shows a powerful message of how greed and corruption can cause a nation into a bloody civil war. The performance given in the movie are pretty good from Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Djimon Hounsou and the action and adventure move along to make this a pounding epic. The plot focuses on two different objectives also. DiCaprio is an ex-mercenary turned diamond smuggler who joins up with Hounsou a Mende fisherman during the civil war of 1999 Sierra Leone, both with objectives to recover a diamond, and to rescue the fisherman's son who has became a child solider in a brutal rebel war. Overall this is an OK film not the best though you really have to be into international history to enjoy it well.",4,2,7,23 March 2007
The Graduate," Sexy and fun entertainment. Mike Nichols has a timeless classic story of the coming of age of a young man.
","It's amazing how well 'The Graduate' stills holds up well today after 4 decades, it's a film that doesn't seem to age from the way Mike Nichols done it, the story could be relevant in any time frame. Dustin Hoffman in one of his earliest roles is Ben Braddock a shy and anxiety like introverted young man who's just graduated from college. Upon graduation he returns home to his cultured and sophisticated overprotective parents(William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson) in Los Angeles, California, and upon arrival the parties and social meetings of his parents friends make Ben feel uncomfortable, because he already feels pressure about his future. The film then gradually changes it's course when Ben upon the gathering at his parents house meets one of his father's friends wife that the very sexy and attractive yet aggressive and extroverted Mrs. Robinson(played gracefully and wonderfully by Anne Bancroft). Ben is then completely lost and caught up in his own little world as for the first time it's time for him to relax and have fun and for once feel like a rebellious youth of his counter culture generation. At first Ben is nervous and hesitant, yet slowly and surely he gives into the seduction of Mrs. Robinson. It clearly is a coming of manhood for Ben as he gets to explore his sides of lust, pleasure, and feel good nature. The scene of him and Mrs. Robinson together are so memorable they stick with a viewer for their fun and sexy wit nature, plus Anne Bancroft was a sexy knockout choice for this role very memorable of her scene when Ben unzips her and she's wearing that black colored leopard dotted strapless bra. For the 1960's Anne sure was the sex symbol of the day. Only soon Ben feels the guilt and entrapment, yet that will change when he meets a younger college girl named Elaine(Katharine Ross) only to find out that she is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson! Now talk about a dilemma for a young man. As Ben knows Elaine is his only escape and likely true love, he must still face the fact that Mrs. Robinson wants them separated forever! Ben now shows his manhood by being at his best to stop everything and escape with Elaine. Really a great film at it's time that's held up due to it's story and Nichols done a great job to show that it's thru life experiences that one comes of age and learns how to make decisions and find what's right for them just like the Ben character did as after getting pleasure experience he finds what is right. Also the songs by Simon and Garfunkel relate and move the film so well. Clearly Nichols directed a gem here that's a timeless coming of age classic that a viewer can find meaningful anytime.",8,1,2,29 October 2007
Alice in Wonderland," Visually enchanting. Tim Burton once again skews one's world view with this wonderful literary classic.
","I for one am a big Tim Burton fan, he's one of the best directors around in film. I love his offbeat use of odd faced characters, and dark backdrops similar to old classic German cinema techniques. Burton always seems to be the master of the sky the leader of the macabre as his oddball characters bring out the best of not only themselves but Burton as well. And this is proved in his films ranging from 'Batman', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood', 'Sweeny Todd', and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. So I knew going in I would enjoy his take on 'Alice in Wonderland' as he once again teamed up with Johhny Depp so I know the chemistry was present for some great work.I probably enjoyed the film even more having saw it in IMAX as the crystal clear images and teardrop reflections of images flying right off of the screen was exhilarating to witness. I for one knew like most the plot and story of this literature classic even though I had never read Lewis Carroll's take. Even more fun was the kooky and colorful zany take that Burton would have. The story is typical taking place in London a young girl named Alice(Mia Wasikowska)thinks back to an adventure she had and enjoyed thirteen years earlier, and at the present she seems weighed and tightened down by family and a politically correct majority.So with any typical fairy tale when a little bunny rabbit appears Alice is lead to a fall thru hole that will take her to a magical joyful land of new adventure and new characters! Alice's meetings aside from the rabbit include the March Hare, the smiling Cheshire Cat, and the awkward yet lovable chubby fellows Tweedledee/Tweedledum(Matt Lucas). To top the journey adventure off Alice meets the strange yet determined Mad Hatter(Johnny Depp)and this character reminds one of a Carrot Top in Kabuki makeup. It's the goal of all to slay an ancient dragon called Jabberwock which will fulfill a prophecy and free Wonderland from the Red Queen(Helena Bonham Carter). The power and a special item(a sword that slays the dragon)will be returned to the White Queen(Anne Hathaway, as this character is a spitting image of Snow White and Ginda the good witch). This tale clearly has similar themes to another classic like 'The Wizard of Oz' as I just mentioned a comparison a few lines ago.Overall this film is enjoyable and a visual treat to watch especially in IMAX it's your typical classic feel good literature tale of meeting new friends, good against evil, as along the way courage, thought, and love is learned. It's really a must see too for any Tim Burton fan as here he shot actors against green screens filling in the world with computer generated imagery. As clearly this is one film where the images and characters outweigh and outclass the plot and stories meaning.",7,5,13,5 March 2010
Avatar," A research experiment of fantasy that leads to discovery, adventure, and fun!
","'Avatar' without a doubt pushes the movie making limit and that can be expected since it's a James Cameron film who's a master of sci-fi and adventure fantasy films. And with this latest he clearly pushes the envelope with the graphics of digital computer 3-D and CGI which is becoming more and more common in film. Still if you don't get caught up in all of the special things you will find that this film 'Avatar' is a journey of wonder, adventure, and excitement that involves exploring new lands and new people of a different culture. Neat and crazy to look at the blue aliens and winged creatures. Yet this is a Cameron film it's all about going big to far out lands and pushing the imagination to the max.The story centers around a paraplegic ex marine Jake Sully(Sam Worthington)who enters an experimental government program that is being ran by a group of scientists. Dr. Grace Augustine(the veteran Sigourney Weaver)is the bitchy programmer of the experiments, which involves putting humans like Jake into compartments that travel them into the distant moon planet of Pandora. With the goal to extract and find the planet's natural resources from the resident aliens that live on the planet who are called the Na'vi. And along the way just like any other planet conflicts, drama, bonding, and war will be found yet most notable is the unlikely love found with Jake's guide that's once he's blue occupied and that happens to be the lovely Neytiri. And this is a fun experimental ride all the way in which the blue alien culture of Na'vi's come to be saved.With the technology and effects combined with the journey this film takes of showing a future world it certainly lets a viewers imagination run wild. True this genre of film may not be everyone's cup of tea yet it's one to be looked at and respected due to the masterful and precise work of one of the great directors such as James Cameron.",7,2,14,18 December 2009
Grindhouse," Wow! This is the most fun you will have watching a three hour movie. Cool and a double feature that's filled with it all.
","I just saw 'Grindhouse' and I must say that this picture rocks! This is the most fun anyone will have watching a film for three hours! You name it 'Grindhouse' has it all thrills, chills, spills, action, drama, and just plain fun. It was really a neat ideal that two directing risk takers like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez team up to do a double feature that mostly pays homage to the classic B movie genre of horror and sci-fi. This film is certainly a tribute to the days of exploitation films and squalor. 'Grindhouse' is split up into two movies first is Robert Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror' and then it's followed by Tarantino's 'Death Proof'. It's done in an old fashioned kind of way too, starting with scratchy mismatched prints, and odd ball trailers for make believe slasher films. The best trailer is the one for the gross slasher Thanksgiving that plays the theme music and pays homage to 80's horror films like 'Creepshow', that helps sink the audience into well respected pop culture. Then the features begin with the twirling rainbow feature presentation.First up is in my opinion the best tale 'Planet Terror' which is portrayed in rural Texas and starts with a bang having Rose McGowan as a sexy and slick stripper, and the feel of this is done like being back into the 70's. This small town becomes the center of an all out terror in the form of flesh eating zombies that want to suck the life out of human beings and take over the nuclear weapons at the local military base, this then leads everyone involved on a wild chase of action, and the scenes done are mostly nonstop action of blood, shootings, car chases, and fighting with explosions probably the most action filled badness you will see in a movie in quite sometime. The actors in this tale don't miss a beat with good acting from Freddy Rodriguez, Josh Brolin, and Marley Shelton. And to me I like the McGowan character as to me she's an antihero a stripper who's trying to find love and fight the zombies while suffering a body part loss. Really Rodriguez gave this plenty of hyperbole like Rose McGowan ending up with a machine gun as a prosthetic leg. Now talk about a leg up on the competition! In the end 'Planet Terror' ends as fairy tale for the small town people who conquer the blood sucking zombies, and because of the way it's done paying homage to low grade scenes of love and skin flesh it's remembered as an instant classic of perfection.Next it's Tarantino's turn with 'Death Proof' which isn't as good, but certainly entertains and has much more of a story to it. This stars veteran Kurt Russell as a cocky stuntman who will meet his match from some sexy trash talking females(Rosario Dawson and Zoe Bell) yet the endless jabbering and talk is a bit boring and long, it's just Quentin's way of providing an appetizer before the wild two car chase! Leaving the final showdown as brutal! Really it's nice to see movies like these that provide homage to old genre classics, and they provide many laughs, thrills and entertainment enjoyment, because it doesn't take things so serious. The blood, sex, and gory like this has certainly brought the glory feel back to the movies and plus it was done in a such a cool way of a double feature by two directors who often go against the establishment with their own outspoken methods.",9,2,9,6 April 2007
The Artist," A classic near excellent tribute to the classic days of film ,nice historical take on Hollywood's start.
","If you have studied film history or follow the movies then you know how it all started long before the days, of special effects, graphics, digital work and heck even before talk their was the silent picture! And this film 'The Artist' captures those times just perfect it showcased that thru the 1920's even though that motion picture was silent still yet, we had our movie stars, tabloid drama, gossip, set struggles, and people enjoyed the movies all before it would change over to a talking picture! Set in 1927 Hollywood, 'The Artist' follows the path of screen star the big silent picture king himself George Valentin(Jean Dujardin)who after making picture after picture meets an up and coming want to be actress in the graceful and attractive Peppy Miller(good turn by Berenice Bejo)and this little lady has a love for dance. As with times and culture changes come even to pictures and by the end of the decade George's worst nightmare has came true the talking picture has been introduced.Slowly George fades from sight and goes into a deep depression, on the opposite side Peppy is everyone's favorite screen star with her dance moves and it helps as she has agreed to talk. Only this turns to an emotional journey of love and dealing with struggles of change as with dance moves and words combined with love George and Peppy come together to make the perfect picture! Overall near excellent film that's historical and a tribute to old classic film that highlights themes of change, emotions, love, and happiness so well in a classic traditional way.",9,0,1,28 January 2012
Invictus," A film that shows how becoming inspired can change a nation when you connect up with forgiveness despite racial and political tension.
","As always Clint Eastwood does such wonderful work probably better as a director than an actor. And it's no different here as Eastwood directs 'Invictus' a good film not just of historical meaning and terms, but it's interesting how it connects with people of a once fractured country to inspire the will to be happy all thru forgiveness. This film is not just about the release of one Nelson Mandela but more of how he transforms the country thru of all things it's white rugby team.Starting in 1990 when Mandela(Morgan Freeman as always is his classy and spot on best from expressions to even the cadences) is released from South African prison to a country that's still split by racial tensions and transitional violence. As for years the blacks have always had problems with the whites as the popular rugby team the Springboks are detested by the blacks. Yet Mandela thru his love and learning about forgiveness surprises his people and supports the team as this is his way to springboard the country to be more loving and compassionate.The rugby team lead by captain Francois Pienaar(Matt Damon who's chemistry with Freeman is good)meets with Mandela and he becomes inspired to work harder so they can win the World Cup and prove to all South Africans that peace and love is possible for all as all of them no matter what color are the same and the team represents everyone. True this film is an inspirational one that's connected to athletics yet deep underneath it's more about the changing times of a nation lead by forgiveness and inner working of politics. The film moves along well as Eastwood paces the action field shots well as the rugby scenes are entertaining as you cheer for victory even though you know the Springboks are gonna be winners.Still I really don't call this a sports movie even though it's connected to it. The film has a much more deep meaning proving that a leader can inspire a nation and change their thoughts thru a winning team as he learned forgiveness and that a nation should be one. Really good to show when inspired attitudes change hard times even like racial tensions as it's always important that cultures and things change in society. Plus with this strong performance by the class act Freeman and it's themes of nation changing, forgiveness, inspiration 'Invictus' is one film that makes a person happy after they see it.",8,1,4,12 December 2009
La La Land," A satire and spin on dreams, hope, and finding love.
","'La La Land' is one of those pictures as you watch you feel teased with the good times and feel good nature that you hear from the music played during the film, as this picture comes off as a pretty good musical drama. Still it's more than that it's a movie of hope, love, romance, and having the faith to dream. Set in sunny Los Angeles it follows the tale of Sebastian(Ryan Gosling)and Mia(Emma Stone)who are both finding life a struggle as Sebastian is a down on his luck jazz pianist who seems to get fired gig after gig and Mia is an aspiring actress who continues to get turned down audition after audition and really it seems as if no hope is around. Still thru the bond of friendship and love that the two make in the city of angels hope is within reach and it shows that dreams are possible and stars do come out and shine. Overall good fairy tale of hopes and dreams coming true involving life and love.",8,2,7,10 January 2017
Saw," Clever. Heart pounding fright and terror. The birth of a new horror franchise.
","Saw when first released in 2004, the low budget horror flick, wasn't expected to do much, but guess what surprise over 100 million! It looks as if though James Wan has founded a new horror gem. When I finally viewed it I was amazed at the clever plot and bloody gore. Saw is well done, well shot as it tries to teach us morals. Only these life lessons are taught by a new sadistic serial killer Jigsaw, who abducts his morally wayward and he puts each in a horrific game of cat and mouse survival. The abducted must fight for life or die in the process. And some of Jigsaw's methods are clever and cruel such as chaining victims feet together, strapping people to seats with leather even ranging from fire torture and barb wire cutting methods how cruel and sick! Saw begins with Carry Elwes who plays an abducted doctor who is chained up with an abducted photographer, the cat and mouse game is clever and sickening, as Jigsaw watches both thru camera and makes cell phone calls to them! The Elwes character is unaware that Jigsaw has held hostage his wife and daughter, and the only way they survive is that the photo man must die. Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega give fine performances as the wife and daughter of the Elwes's character. It is just so sad and sickening though when the sadistic killer has both the Monica and Makenzie characters bound, tied up and gagged. As while both are pleading for mercy the crazy uses a stethoscope to check the fright and fast heartbeat of Makenzie while he points a gun to Monica's head, how terrifying as they both scream and cry thru their gagged mouths. Really a tough scene, overall this film is frightening in a way that disturbs the mind as a dangerous game that's tough to win, it seems only the lucky survive. Saw is a must see it was good to finally see a new twist and take on the horror genre with Jigsaw. I must finally say a thumbs up for James Wan's clever new fright franchise.",8,0,1,31 October 2006
Up," A wonderful and feel good adventure journey of connection and fun surprises with new friends and new land!
","Disney's Pixar is at it again as once more they prove to be the kings of animation! One of 2009's best rightfully titled 'Up' a very funny film that touches and connects your heart emotionally even if your a grown adult like me! It proves that when you go up in the sky limits are no more in terms of friendships, journey, and most of all you find unexpected happiness.The tale centers around Carl Fredricksen a 78 year old retired balloon salesman who's lonely and grumpy after losing his wife. Yet Carl's always been a part time dreamer who wants one more chance to fly the high skies. As the surrounding area around him one by one is being crushed off Carl has an extreme and clever plan to save his house, he's tied thousands of balloons to it to make it fly and float away with the sky clouds when he's ready! He wants to accomplish his childhood dreams of seeing lost worlds.To throw a rock to his journey he meets Carl Russell an overeager eight year old Wilderness explorer who's never ventured past his own back yard so he wants to journey along! Just when you think that this friendship is odd and unusual along the journey both meet the oddest yet most loved new friends in the form of Dug a dog with a special collar that allows him to speak. Now if you think that's neat how about Kevin a rare 13-foot-tall flightless bird! All stuck together in the far away land and jungle many unexpected twist and turns are taken as a journey doesn't always go as planned.Clearly for an animation film 'Up' scores a big victory it has all the themes and elements that appeal to a viewers emotions young or old as the ability to journey after dreaming for so long combined with the fact that connections are made finding new friends even though they seem unlikely it's both touching and very sentimental. So soar to the sky and ride the clouds to a wonderful adventure as when you go up you never know what to expect look out as delightful surprises await.",8,0,2,18 January 2010
Snowden," Pretty good film of a whistle blower not a yes man who looks out for people's protected rights!
",Director Oliver Stone is still doing it making movies about issues that circle around people's world and it involves events that are history making and life changing. And again Oliver makes a delivery here with this one as the biography picture called 'Snowden' gives an in depth look at NSA whistle blower Edward really good. As for many like me I look at Edward as a hero for uncovering the truth about the illegal on goings of the NSA as how they were spying and collecting data on Americans most private things like listening in on phone and cell calls and monitoring internet surfing and collecting credit and bank accounts and finding about travel information on citizens. As it's clear no one lives in a private world! And Joseph Gordon Levitt portrays Edward with life and hard work ethic as an agency worker about his job. Overall pretty good film that's revealing that blows the lid government and shows it's good to speak up and not be a yes man!,6,1,7,20 September 2016
A Clockwork Orange," Raw and wicked. Stanley Kubrick's take on the mind and macabre.
","'A Clockwork Orange' is clearly a film of delight, pleasure, and just flat out raw drama and horror. The scenes and images during the film are highly remembered and stunning especially the colorful displays in houses and the sculptured mannequins in the milk bar at the films start. Also flashing images of nude women and even Christ are hard to leave one's mind after watching the film. The story is a great take on character study of the mind and how it can change. You have Alex(Malcolm McDowell) a thug and modern day hooligan who along with his friends enjoy having fun at the expense and tragedy of others. You name it Alex and his sidekicks roam modern day Britian in search of terror, from violence to the attacks and rapes of women. A viewer will find many scenes of this film disturbing . Until one day Alex's little playhouse comes crashing down when caught he's sent to prison. Upon arrival he begins the journey of reform it's only when a new experiment of a mind and ego transplant takes place that really changes him and it makes this film a different story from the second half on. Alex then upon release finds himself a different person now a proper citizen after being brainwashed it's crazy to see him encounter his family, friends, and many victims after his release it's just not the same as the guilt, remorse, and sorrow drive him to be crazy and again a need to be dark. Really I just love the way that Kubrick showed how one's mind can change and that people can take on new and different personalities and behavior, and yes I believe anything is possible by mind manipulation and tinkering. Really a film that shows two sides of a central character like Alex the good and the bad proving that the mind and one's own free will and choice either makes or breaks you. To sum it up 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the best films made because of the images, and the music theme is creepy and spooky it really tingles your skin, Stanley Kubrick as always pushes the limits by showing another side to humanity and life proving that having fun and a good feeling can both be great. A final say this classic proved still that much is still to be discovered in terms of the mind and of the future, clearly an unforgettable picture.",10,0,1,29 June 2007
Invincible," Support the underdog, after the movie you will smile!
","After just seeing 'Invincible' I must say thumbs up! Way to go that finally after 30 years this true story is brought to the big screen. Call me bias or partial because I'm an Eagles fan, but the story of any underdog making an NFL team makes you happy. 30 year old bartender and part-time school teacher Vince Papale who finds life a struggle from his wife leaving him, to problems paying his bills he finds only one hope that is to escape thru his love and passion for the Eagles. Papale a season ticket holder and sandlot football star decides to give himself a shot at a better life in 1976 when newly hired coach Dick Vermil decides to hold open tryouts. Papale has the odds stacked against him, but thru his will and determination to make it, because no one ever expected him to do anything he prevails! Papale lands a roster spot as a special teams player a blue-collar guy doing blue collar work on the field. The scenes and background of this movie, especially the way Veterans Stadium is shown is sketchy and unbelievable, but the story is true and touching. Vince Papale played for the Eagles for three seasons, well acted and done by Mark Wahlberg who showed enthusiasm with this role. Also Greg Kinnear is great as legendary head coach Dick Vermeil, overall a great movie of an underdog that leaves you smiling at the end. I hope more real-life NFL movies are made about players, because 'Invincible' sets the standard.",8,69,78,25 August 2006
Love & Mercy," An informative and provocative biography type picture of music legend Brian Wilson and his struggles with life, love, and work.
","Finally got around to watching 'Love and Mercy' and I must say that it was well done a biography picture that tells a lot about a legend. I know 'the Beach Boys' were before my time yet I grew to like their music as it played while I was growing up. This film tells the story of singer and songwriter Brian Wilson so well showing his good and bad parts of life so well. You will find out why he almost left from the music stage and life itself. The picture is told from two different points of view and thru flashback form as Paul Dano plays the young coming of age Wilson mostly thru the 1960's and we get to see a grown up and still depressed Wilson in the 1980's as an adult played by John Cusack.Thru out the film it is moved along just fine by the music of 'The Beach Boys', still this picture is a showcase of a man who has lost control almost with his battle against bi polar disorder and hearing voices as along with mood swings it all almost destroys Wilson. Plus the business battles with the band and agents is highlighted and Brian's fight with his therapist is a battle as this is all just backdrop stuff before Brian returns to his life of music. All of this is made better and good when Brian finds peace by falling in love with Melinda(the beautiful Elizabeth Banks).This film shows how one can grow thru struggle and dealing with tough times like that of facing a mental disorder and the battle of business involving people and money always brushes the surface yet in the end thru faith, strength, determination and finding most of all love with a beautiful woman in the end happiness is reached.",8,2,3,10 January 2016
Rocky," More than just a sports or boxing movie. A human triumph of the human spirit an underdog goes the distance!
","1976's best picture winner 'Rocky' in my opinion is one of the better films ever made it touches your emotions in so many ways it's just not a boxing movie, it's simply a tale of a human spirit triumph. It's also a significant film for the way it was made. Sly Stallone virtually unknown and broke got the inspiration for this when real life and underdog boxer Chuck Wepner had went the distance with the 'Greatest' Muhammad Ali. Stallone wrote the script on a shoestring budget and it's a real knockout winner and sentimental favorite for many reasons.Rocky Balboa(Stallone)a fourth rate and tomato can Philadelphia club fighter is a man who's lonely and at 30 even resorts to earning a living as a collector for street thugs on the mean streets of the city of brotherly love. Yet still buried deep down he has the desire and the hunger and heart to be a good fighter.Along the way the film is also somewhat an emotional journey of a love story as Rocky finally finds some companionship and love when he meets a shy and ordinary and lonely pet store clerk named Adrianna(Talia Shire). Plus very memorable and comical is the supporting performance of Adrianna's brother the funny and very rugged looking and rude Paulie(good performance by Burt Young). The best of the supporting cast and maybe one of the best in film history is from legendary Burgess Meredith as Mick the tough and rough but very wise and humble old man. Who after some friction and doubt sees the determination and fire that the Italian Stallion has, so Mick decides to train Rock for a title match against the champ Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers).For a film that's very cherished and memorable the performances are great, the acting, story and even the musical score is touching the sounds are some of the best in film history. The movie seen by many so many times is a true classic for it's tale of an underdog who went the distance an unknown who became known a hero to the working class. The film is truly an inspiration and it proves with work and determination and hunger the human spirit can achieve anything. It's not always whether you win or lose, but how you fight and it's important to go the distance. Overall a classic one of the best films in history for it's inspirational message proving that with the desire to fight your spirit will go the distance!",10,0,0,30 December 2008
Sicario," An intense somewhat raw dirty drama of doing whatever it takes to get it done.
","Just saw 'Sicario' and I will say that certainly in my opinion it's not a great movie, yet still it's intense enough and raw with drama for any crime drama movie fan to view. As is so common in today's headlines from the news it's Mexico against the United States in the drug border war and a lot of those problems involve the Mexican drug cartel. This drama story centers around a young and hard working up and coming FBI agent named Kate(Emily Blunt)who joins a federal task force to go to the U.S. and Mexican border to fight the drug war. And from the start Kate sees that this is a brutal and blood like war with guns and body after body being discovered. Along the way good supporting help is provided from Matt Graver(Josh Brolin)yet the anti hero and key player in helping find the Mexican drug leader is a renegade named Alejandro(Benicio Del Toro). It proves that in life and war you don't always play by the rules as many times they are bent and broken, overall this movie is raw, gritty, and downright blunt!",7,1,3,6 October 2015
Inside Man," OK, but I've seen better.
","Just yesterday I watched 'Inside Man' at the cinemas, coming out feeling entertained and somewhat disappointed. Your typical cop- robbery and hostage situation is portrayed well, but the way the film ends lets me down. You have Denzel Washington as a NYPD detective called out after mastermind bank robber Clive Owen and his team hit one of New York's biggest and richest banks, within the first minutes of the film after taking the bank employees hostage it was nice to see those sexy and cute female bank tellers strip down in underclothes getting to see those sexy colored bras and panties they wear! After the hostages are finally free the ending upsets me as sure Clive Owen is sent to prison, but Det. Denzel collects the money as it turns out to be an inside scheme started by a hostage negotiator played by Jodie Foster and bank president Christopher Plummer. A sad ending for me because I'm tired of all the crooked plots and schemes designed in our movies, because they happen more and more in our world, making everyone rich not only just the bad guys, but also the good guys as we see of Denzel Washington's character in the end.",6,1,2,26 March 2006
Les Misérables," A musical that's a tale of hope, love and rising to oppose the rich and powerful for change!
","'Les Miserables' is one of those musical's that is long and drawn out and kind of in depth from director Tom Hooper. And the film may not be liked by everyone as the live music action taking place on screen is much different than that of actual speaking dialogue it's like a live action musical! Anyway it has a touch of history being set in 19th century France as it involves the citizens uprising against the powerful and corrupted. Based on a Broadway play the musical performances are top notch especially the vocal work of Anne Hathaway. The story is centered around Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman) a prisoner a French convict who after years of hard labor has broken away from the grips of the tough and rugged French officer enforcer Javert(Russell Crowe), and along the way Jean will become the protector of Fantine's(Anne Hathaway) beautiful daughter. Fantine a woman who was a factory worker has turned to the world's oldest profession of selling her body to make a buck for her daughter takes a dive. So the rest of the way the surge and uprising and new revolt of citizens is lead by the ex convict Jean. Overall this film entertains as a musical and it's message of the people's uprising of revolt and fighting for freedom and rights of equality and wage rights rings true today overall a film that dreams of freedom, equal rights and human equality that equals and fights the powerful.",6,1,2,31 December 2012

","'The Happening' is clearly a film that most sci-fi fans will enjoy to watch you have to let your thoughts and imagination roll along as one by one the strangest things happen as you the viewer feel like your in another universe. It really feels like a big screen version of an extended 'Twilight Zone' episode. Director M.

The Shape of Water," A beauty and the beast fairy tale of love, hope, and connection.
","Never really been a watcher of Guillermo del Toro movies, yet being a lover and liking movies that blend sci-fi and pay homage to classic monsters, I for sure had to check out this latest epic called 'The Shape of Water'. And this movie is a touching and moving film that's a blend of drama, romance, and adventure fantasy.Set in the late 1950's early 1960's in Baltimore at a top notch government research lab this movie becomes a journey of escape and a journey of connection for two people who couldn't be more different. Sally Hawkins is Elisa a lonely and mute janitor who's only friends are her co worker Zelda(in a blunt and brash performance from Octavia Spencer)and her neighbor Giles(a wonderful Richard Jenkins). Plus Elisa puts up with verbal and mental abuse from her cold and mean boss Richard(the in groove Michael Shannon). However being alert and noticing things behind the scenes with eyes and ears pays off for Elisa.Elisa slowly but surely begins a relationship of love and intimacy with a strange and mysterious sea like creature(something similar to the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon'). And aside from this the film becomes a drama of twists and turns a need for escape and survival and you ask questions who can and who do you trust?Overall this movie is a great escape of connection and a journey to love and belonging proving that happiness is possible for lonely and different types of people. 'The Shape of Water' is clearly one journey that's sentimental, emotional, and heart touching as the film will leave you touched and moved with love and wanting peace for all.",9,34,62,27 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Well done look at the origin of how a cult classic came about.
","I have seen many movies yet have never watched 'The Room' over the coming months I plan to see it. As I've wondered what was always the fuss and as to why many art house and independent cinema chains have countless midnight showing of this film. So being one for film history and stories that involve origins, I decided to watch 'The Disaster Artist' and I must say the work was well done as it gave me the viewer a better understanding of 'The Room'.Set sometime in 1998 it is the story of one Tommy Wiseau(in a fine turn from James Franco) who wants to become an actor so this apparent New Orleans native with a hard to call accent who claims to be in his 20's ventures out to Los Angeles for acting classes, and he meets and befriends a different style and kind of guy in Greg Sestero(Dave Franco)yet both have dreams of being well known actors. It's gonna be a challenge though with Tommy's long hair and heavy metal rocker looks. Yet with a bank account and the desire to set up his own studio and shoot scenes with his own cameras hope is present for Tommy and Greg.As the movie they plan to make is just one simple love story of passion and drama, yet Wiseau acts as his own independent style of a rebel and maverick on set as he calls the shots behind the camera and in front of it when he acts you feel like it's Hitchcock or Kubrick. Tommy did things his way. Still the actual film 'The Disaster Artist' is blended with humor and pathos when it looks at the ups and downs of a guy striving for survival and the acceptance of humanity. Along the way many cameos are from well knowns like Jacki Weaver, Seth Rogen, Alison Brie, Sharon Stone, Bryan Cranston, Judd Apatow, and Melanie Griffith.Overall 'The Disaster Artist' is a showcase film of desire and wanting acceptance to make something you want to feel belonging still the audience feels and sees the rage of one would be up and coming artist like Tommy who's own rules didn't apply it's like the world was against him. Still even though a mess Tommy did it his way proving it's okay to be different, it's meant to be different and everyone will be different. As with difference and being a disaster Tommy Wiseau will long be remembered and his work is a stepping stone for many underdogs and up and comers.",8,0,1,12 December 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," A classic. It touches your emotions making one to learn to enjoy life, while bringing tears of joy at the films end.
","Finally after all these years I decided to set down and watch the Frank Capra classic from 1946 'It's A Wonderful Life' and I must say overall I was well pleased a film that makes one feel down and depressed yet it touches your emotions and makes you be thankful especially the way the film ends it can bring your eyes to water up. The legendary Jimmy Stewart who performs fine here plays George Bailey a man who thru life has always seemed to have gotten the short end. From his days as a child when George felt guilty for not watching his brother to the days of never reaching his full potential and having to take over the business of banking loans once his father passes unexpectedly. It seems that George's life is problem after problem even after he enjoys life with his significant other Mary(Donna Reed) then his business sinks and the loans of bank customers turn to debt and it seems life for George is now finally doomed as if he will be broken just before Christmas. All along from the films start we as the viewer can see somewhat of a foreshadowing technique starting out with the stars in the sky of angels up above who keep a close eye on everyone including George. Then upon Christmas as in so many holiday fairy types a magical visit occurs this time it's from an angel named Clarence. The journey that George takes is even more depressing, but in the end he sees the true light and love from everyone in town. Capra really proved with this film that no matter how bad it seems or it gets in life that in the end if you have loved and given friends will turn out in the end in time of need and not let failure or darkness happen. Many times some of us aren't felt to be loved or liked, but we are fooled and surprised in the end with a little help from up above. The ending with the bell and angel is timeless and a classic well remembered by most viewers. Clearly thumbs up for Frank Capra who made an emotional and touching classic with a little help from the angels in the heavens above it touches a viewer and makes them feel loved and uplifts their spirits.",9,0,3,9 December 2007
The Departed," Good crime -thrilling drama by a directing legend that features an all-pro cast.
","Last weekend when I went to the movies to see 'The Departed' I knew I would see a good thriller, and it didn't let me down. Being a big Jack Nicholson fan this was a must see for me as I see all of his movies, that was enjoyable but the plot and twist of this movie made it that much more pleasing. Also 'The Departed' features an all-pro cast not only Nicholson, but you have Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and being directed by a legend like Scorsese made it well worth a watch. 'The Departed' is a terrific cops-and mobsters tale that is complicated and compelling. You have the Massachusetts State Police ready to bring down ruthless mobster Frank Costello(played perfect by Jack)enter Boston bred police trainee Billy Costigan(DiCaprio) whose put undercover to dig dirt. The police captain(Sheen) and command sergeant(Wahlberg) are the only ones to know of Costigan's assignment and nobody else does. Scandals are unaware though when rising young sergeant Sullivan(Damon)is already in the special unit known only to his commander, and Sullivan secretly is loyal to Costello who tips Frank off about the moves of police. This movie then one by one becomes a puzzle hard to figure out as no one seems to be who they are. I really like Scorsese's use of realism of the violence and intensity he shows of this film, I guess that can be expected when dealing with the Boston mob though. You will love the blood soaked gore and bullet scenes the best I've seen in a while also. 'The Departed' is a film to me that shows one by one how people depart from business or the very life they have one by one as you will see in the film. This is a must see because of the good plot and twist and the great acting.",8,0,0,17 October 2006
Psycho," Hitch's best. One of the best and most memorable suspense thrillers in film history. Well liked for the famous shower scene.
","'Psycho' is without a doubt a classic film a suspense thriller that ranks well in memory it impacted cinema and pop culture it's a film that ranks as iconic history. When I first saw it I was even afraid to take showers as a kid! As the famous shower scene impacted me that much, and many people even had a phobia of staying in a motel after seeing this film classic. Later thru the years after countless viewings I adjusted and saw every moment of the film as pleasure as after I learned how the shower scene was shot I learned to appreciate cinema history and the techniques of how the shower scene was shot with superior montage editing.Alfred Hitchcock the master of thriller suspense had it all in 'Psycho' the many themes present are lust, sex, embezzlement, greed, secrets, taxidermy, voyeurism, and a split personality which caused someone to cross dress as their dead mother! Aside from that the shower shower scene is memorable one of the most famous in film history and combined with the performances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, 'Psycho' is a memorable classic that a viewer can't get enough of.Set in Arizona it begins with Marion Crane(played so beautiful and very elegantly sexy by Janet Leigh a 60's screen siren. Plus it was a real treat to see Janet undress and sport that sexy black bra!)a woman who as a lonely secretary only has a hobby of being a sexy and elegant seducer of her boyfriend a man who's divorced. And Marion wants escape so one Friday afternoon after returning from lunch break when she receives a payment for her boss from a rich oil business man an ideal is sprung to mind. Marion will leave town only the money is not put in the bank it will take a journey ride with Marion to California. Interesting and very watchful along the way is the scenes of the deep voiced policeman who follows Marion a little distance, as I think Hitchcock used these scenes to show a viewer that Ms. Crane felt guilt about her exit.Only one rainy evening in California she drives upon the lonely Bates motel and this place feels different as it's clearly not what it seems. Attending is Norman Bates(wonderfully done and over the top by Anthony Perkins) who's a strange guy a shut in who tends to his old sick mother(supposedly)and Norman has a hobby of collecting dead birds! As he talks and checks Ms. Crane in Norman seems normal, yet he's anything but. Then shocking is when Marion gets settled in she tries to unwind and chill with a hot shower, only this is one shower that will spray out a sliced up death as it will become a blood bath! As Marion will clearly have her secrets washed away in blood.Many don't know the shower scene was shot from seventy different camera positions. As the montage editing is fantastic as the way the shots were linked together showing a certain form of art. This was adapted from the Soviet Union from the classic director Eisenstein as the clashing of images is graphic as it matches the film's shower scene so well. As each clashing scene the knife is shown going back and fourth from Leigh's body the images clash with blood showing the graphic side of life as this film has a bloody form of art. And most telling and chilling is the final shot when Janet falls as the blood drips down the tub drain showing her dead the drain symbolizes her life has indeed went down the drain! Really this is one scene I can go on and on about as if you know and study film their is always something you can find that the shower scene symbolizes and links to life and a graphic form of death. The scene was just so brilliant.So did Norman do it or was it mad mother who knows as Hitchcock tries to keep it a little suspenseful. Only you the viewer know the real shock poor Norman is a dressed up guy having a thing for women's wardrobe! Overall great suspense thriller classic from Alfred it proves we all have the right to go a little mad. It proves that you can't run from and hide your secrets. And when you arrive in a strange place you never know what to expect, as hidden secrets are present and they might just be stranger than yours just even mad and crazy! 'Psycho' is one of the best films ever made.",10,1,2,19 December 2010
Rosemary's Baby," At it's time a haunting foreshadowing tale that was symbolic and visually explicit.
","In his day the legendary and controversial director Roman Polanski made some of the best and most cutting edge films of the day. And with this horror mind drama classic 'Rosemary's Baby' it proves with his use of symbols and foreshadowing combined with the creepy music his films kept you on the edge of your seat. Many may say during the 60's this was the best horror film made maybe in terms psychologically, yet my pick is 1960's 'Psycho'.Anyway the story is set in New York city a couple Rosemary(Mia Farrow)and Guy(John Cassavetes)just have moved into a high rise luxury apartment building and Guy is a struggling actor trying to make it from commercials and plays to the big time of studio pictures. As like all couples settling down they want to start a family only soon they realize after being taken in strange things happen like unexpected tenants deaths. Most striking which foreshadows the viewer and shows symbols so well is the weird and frightening dreams that Rosemary starts to have as is it confusion and worry for a first time mother just who's baby is it she's having.Overall pretty good film that keeps you intrigued with the crazy and foreshadowing type dreams proving that really a lot in life can be strangely cursed. This was clearly a film that was cutting edge at it's time as Polanski pushed the envelope to audiences so their imaginative fears could be sent thru the mind.",6,0,1,7 December 2009
The Holiday," Nice and neat concept. The changing of two lives brings happiness and pleasure.

Now with the age of internet surfing these two depressed women meet online and exchange homes for the Christmas holiday. And a change for the better!

This concept was well it just goes to show that a change of location is so many times for the better and it brings happiness and unexpected love and new friends. Plus fine performances from both Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz.",7,1,2,23 March 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," A nerve and spine tingling raw real life political international drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
","After watching 'Zero Dark Thirty' you and I can respect the CIA and Navy seals and U.S. military for all they do it's one dangerous job. And every American knows of the harrowing real life story of the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden a decade long one that when finally the man was destroyed relieved everyone. This picture directed by Kathryn Bigelow('The Hurt Locker') is long and a drawn out telling of the journey and years of CIA work from 2001 till 2011 when Osama was brought down. And somewhat raw and grueling is the interrogation scenes of torture techniques used as this picture displayed them in a brutal manner. It's one lead, one tip, one statement after another combined with the best camera and military survey equipment that the federal government has that leads slowly, but surely to the downfall of the evil radical. This film is one massive behind the scenes journey of top notch secretive work it's suspenseful and nerve binding. And shining thru it all is the bright little lady working undercover with the CIA it's Maya(in a very blunt and fearless performance from Jessica Chastain). Overall 'Zero Dark Thirty' is one film that pays tribute to the unsung people as it highlights the little behind the scenes things are important as all of it leads to freedom and justice for all Americans.",8,3,8,14 January 2013
Steve Jobs," A film that's a showcase of a man's personal problems and how it intersects with his technology discovery!
","'Steve Jobs' isn't the greatest movie in the world, yet I guess it's a watchable biography type picture which really showcases a man who has both struggles life and job wise. The film shows different sides of Jobs one side is that of a self made computer wizard and the other is that of an arrogant, cold hearted self centered prick. Still it's informative and filled with enough drama and challenge to make it watchable as you learn about the life of a technology legend. Danny Boyle does a good job directing which the film was adapted from a 2011 biography, the film has different steps and time frames with it's focus on the three most important Jobs inventions that was in 1984 the Macintosh and then the NEXT computer in 1988 then finally the iMac in 1998. All along the way Jobs life and work is at a crossroads as he's a divorced dad with a daughter that's tough to love, and the clash with one time Apple chairman John Sculley(Jeff Daniels) is fun and the friendship of childhood pal Steve Wozniak(Seth Rogen) is on and off. Plus Michael Fassbender is in top form as Jobs and moving in a strong tough performance is Kate Winslet as the head strong assistant Joanna Hoffman. Overall this film is an okay and entertaining take that's informative about the life times and struggles both personal and professional of a tech legend.",6,2,5,26 October 2015
Crazy Heart," Jeff Bridges shines in a role about a self destructive yet likable human being, that thru hard living earns a second chance at redemption.
","Even if your not a big country music fan, and I know many in the movie going community aren't I'm really hit and miss with country music, anyway this picture 'Crazy Heart' is a must see for any movie watcher. As expected since the theme relates to country music it shows plenty of sorrow, hard living, and road traveling whiskey drinking. Still it's message shows that even though one does hard living that thru love and courage a chance at redemption can be found. And most of all it's special due to the acting talent of Jeff Bridges as his motions, look and dialect of an outlaw country singer makes this film even seem more believable. And his singing during the film proves he also has special talent.Jeff Bridges(in the performance of a lifetime)is Bad Blake a hard living, chain smoking, whiskey drinking past his prime country music singer who's now down in the dumps. As with age and time fame passes so many by as Bad has found out and the hard living is making Blake show his age and he's also cash strapped nearly broke. He now finds himself having to work and play in front of small crowds across the southwest and western united states. And these crowds are in the form of bowling alleys, rundown beer joints and local small town club circuits. And from joint to joint Bad Blake as expected burns and lives it up hard.It's on his journey to play in Santa Fe, New Mexico he meets a small town newspaper journalists named Jean Craddock(played so sweet and innocently at the same time sexy by Maggie Gyllenhaal). Jean discovers he's a complex and hard lonely man who's been divorced four times and Bad has a grown son back in Texas that he's never seen. Only sparks and a rugged connection of love is found between Jean and Bad as when getting to know Jean, Bad is attached to her young son, something that makes him feel young again and it's fitting as this feels like this is the son that Bad never had. And the flames and sparks of passion fly between both as Blake feels like a new man making love to Jean.Aside from the passion Blake still burns hard at both ends leading to an automobile accident that shakes his life up. Also as he tours he meets up with the now up and coming new generation of country music stars like Tommy Sweet(Colin Farrell)which is tough for Bad to juggle. Thru this all combined with his relationship and hard living Bad comes to realize he has to change before it's to late as he has to step aside so another younger generation can develop. A good supporting turn is also found in veteran legend Robert Duvall who stars as one of Blake's old buddies in Texas named Wayne a bartender who helps Bad in his transformation.Overall great film showing the highs and lows of the life of a country music star, and it's filled with enough emotion, passion, and redemption finding to make it a watch even for those who don't like country music. As Scott Cooper really scores a hit here as both writer and director. The chemistry between Bridges and Gyllenhaal is great even though the sparks of romance doesn't last as it wasn't meant. Most enjoyable is Jeff Bridges with his hard and brash yet believable turn proving that he can take on any role. As the films message is true especially that in country music life is hard living, whiskey drinking, and full of heartbreaks, and a lot of disappointments. However those who live the hardest end up redeeming themselves.",8,2,3,10 February 2010
12 Years a Slave," A raw true big screen telling of a brutal and sad life that one had to wrongly live.
","'12 Years a Slave' may not be everyone's cup of tea to watch as, true it's a true account of the slave days of one kidnapped man Solomon Northup, it's manner in which the brutal beatings and whippings of blacks is cruel, violent, and very sadistic. The film is so raw and brutal with it's scenes that it may turn many off still director Steve McQueen went to great measures to show how brutal and savage that blacks were treated by rich spoiled white land owners in the deep south. Based on the true accounts of one Solomon Northup(in a raw and emotionally honest performance from new guy Chiwetel Ejiofor)who in 1841 is in the northeast in upstate New York working as an actor and stage play person when one night he is lured to a trip to Washington, D.C. and is kidnapped by two southern men and taken to the deep south and sold into slave labor. Here on the plantation the cotton fields life is tough with beatings and whippings and chains are a daily occurrence for all blacks especially with all the sadistic ways of the owner(in a wicked performance from Michael Fassbender)who even has sex with many female black slaves. Most supporting is the meeting that Solomon has with a Canadian abolitionist(in a fine performance from Brad Pitt)this propels Solomon to be set free emotionally and mentally to actual freedom. Overall '12 Years a Slave' is a brutal and somewhat sadistic film still it's one man's true story of courage and will to live as he faced the wicked and evil establishment for many lost and wrong years that he had to spend his life away from freedom and reality.",8,1,3,10 November 2013
Wedding Crashers," Raunchy and feel good enjoyable outrageous comedy of laid back conquests which leads to unexpected loves.
","Since seeing it years ago 'Wedding Crashers' ranks as probably one of the better and more recent feel good comedy films. It's funny yet it's plot seems a little outrageous and wild, it's like a feel good fantasy. And the young and eager energized cast like Wilson, Vaughn, McAdams and Fisher make it sexy and a high pleasure to watch. And veterans such as Walken and Jane Seymour(in a very good role)help support and round out the film making a viewer feel they've watched a good picture.It centers around two buddies the more laid back and quite John Beckwith(Owen Wilson)and Jeremy Grey(Vince Vaughn)the outspoken and lover lady killer. And both are perceived marriage divorce counselors, yet underneath they have a job of crashing weddings and the duo on the side meet and bed some of the hottest and most beautiful chicks around. It's a party conquest one right after the other. Until finally the two decide to set their sights on the nation's capital and things will start to change for the better.Jeremy and John decide to attend the wedding of U.S. treasury secretary Cleary's(Christopher Walken) oldest daughter, and that's when the two wandering eyes spot the brides two younger sisters the cute, beautiful and attractive Claire and Gloria. Jeremy goes after Gloria(one of Isla Fisher's earliest and more sexy roles) who's more of a free spirited sexually aggressive type, and John follows the path of Claire(Rachel McAdams)despite the fact that she has a boyfriend. And along the way the two learn a lot about life, love, sex, and relationships it proves it's unexpected and possible. In a good turn is Jane Seymour as mother Kathleen she's an elegant cougar man eating kitten! Jane still has it after all these years.Overall 'Wedding Crashers' is an okay and funny comedy of learning love, and relationships, and it's backed up just fine with it's raunchy sex and outrageous and awkward scene moments and the well known cast make it watchable especially the sexy performances from Isla Fisher and Jane Seymour were likable and good.",8,0,0,3 March 2011
There Will Be Blood," Epic tale of greed, determination, and corruption. The good and bad of capitalism and the rise and fall of a relentless prospector.
","'There Will Be Blood' is clearly a classic film that has all the interesting and intriguing elements of greed, power struggle and drama that a picture needs. Well directed by Paul Thomas Anderson as his use of the scene work and cinematography is brilliant and the scores played during the film are enchanting and moving. This film was inspired from a 1927 novel from Upton Sinclair called 'Oil'! Set before the start of the 1900's in the old American west you have a young and eager man Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis) who has claim only to a young son, with his only hope as an oilman is to be relentless in his prospects and searches for new oil finds and discoveries. As the film moves along the fortune improves from Daniel's striking gold by finding oil and later from learned tips a boomtown is discovered.Upon Daniel becoming a tycoon the drama and tension of the film takes flight as power struggles exists with the town's dangerous young preacher(Dano) and a tragedy takes upon Daniel's son from an oil machine explosion. Thru the film spanning all during and before the 1900's up till 1927 the viewer can see the highs and lows of the Plainview character and how the capital market is good with greed and can be manipulative, yet evil when down as in the films end we see how Plainview responds to the toll it's taken upon him.Overall 'There Will Be Blood' features an excellent performance by Daniel Day Lewis and the score and look of the American west is stunning and with it's themes of capital market highs and lows combined with greed, pride, and religious struggle along with personal tragedy this film is one of the better winners of the 2007 film crop.",7,2,6,2 February 2008
Joker," Certainly not Jack's 'Joker' or even Heath's still an excellent and dark artistic performance from Joaquin that had my face smiling and that's life!
","Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the 'Clown Prince of Crime' as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only 'Joker'. And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's 'Joker' was like that of the late 70's early 80's 'Joker' in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a 'Golden Globe' or 'Oscar') a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to 'The Dark Knight'. Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates 'The Joker'(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!",10,25,54,4 October 2019
Whiplash," Raw and different a film of mind numbing and physical pain. All while trying to get great!
","Finally saw 'Whiplash' I must say it's one film that takes a look at what's it's like of trying to gain success and conquer your own working demons all while trying to please yourself and others. The film has Miles Teller as Andrew who's a young up and coming want to be drummer who after enrolling in a music school finds that life behind the drum is tough. It's when Andrew sees that his march to the beat of his own drum instructor Fletcher(J.K. Simmons in a very deviant and sadistic like teacher role and maybe his best performance)is one not to play with as the note and key must strike to his hand right on the drum! It's a pain taking task as you will see Andrew play the drums till his fingers bleed! Overall okay film about toughness, sacrifice, discipline, and coming to terms of your own success and failure while meeting the expectations of others.",8,0,1,21 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A near excellent satire on greed, excess, corruption and indulgence it showcases hedonism at it's best!
","After watching 'Wolf of Wall Street' you will feel entertained and also a bit down as you see the good and high party times of a rich greed corrupted stock broker has a fallout to it. That fallout includes drug addiction, broken relationships and yes a prison sentence. Anyway veteran and legendary director Martin Scorsese hams up this satire to show the world of the late 80's thru the mid 90's and how the world of wall street took off becoming a major power player. The wall street business became a pool and a scheme of crime and corruption that tied in both the corporate world and the banking industry. The film based on true events centers on Jordan Belfort(a role that Leonardo DiCaprio pushes to the edge)an up and coming young guy who all of a sudden becomes a wealthy and powerful stockbroker. And Belfort's methods and his rise to power involves bribes, schemes, and false bank accounts that are made for his customers and victim clients. The film has it all insider trading and false security tips still it makes Jordan a very very rich guy. Along with the life comes hard partying coke snorting, binge drinking, and a lot of sex with beautiful women mostly escorts still Jordan hooks a sexy trophy wife. And a man named Donnie(the super Jonah Hill)is funny and crazy as Jordan's partner in crime and top sidekick. Still the good times and high life brings the bad life of addiction and broken relationships all leading to a prison sentence. This is one picture that is a showcase on excess and indulgence showing that the good life can be lived up with highs yet the lows to come are evident as the wolf can only howl for so long and only to a certain point.",8,2,8,29 December 2013
The Last King of Scotland," The Ugandan giant. Forest Whitaker is ruthless as Idi Amin.
","'The Last King of Scotland' is a pretty well done movie, with good acting, a great performance from Forest and yet somewhat brutal and sad with many bloody scenes and you feel sadness for the people of Uganda who are at the hands of such a brutal leader. I really don't see Idi Amin as a good anti-hero to me, I really feel this is a film that should pay more tribute to the young Soctsman doctor Nicholas Garrigan though the film is told through his eyes, many people still praise Amin which he shouldn't be because he's so brutal. As Garrigan found out on his trip to Uganda that it would become a nightmare of brutal suffering and pain. And really the only connection left over for Amin and Garrigan was Idi's love of Scottish culture. So really the performance given from Forest Whitaker is great and well worth a watch, but this is a film in my opinion to be remembered for the young Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan who is the real hero of this brutal tale of dictatorship.",6,0,1,20 April 2007
It Chapter Two," Creepy, Scary, and mind numbing fears thru flashback!
","Saw 'IT Chapter Two' after watching the first two years ago, I must say not the best horror sequel still it held up with chills and fright proving how the past can return to haunt. I guess too for a clown that Pennywise is pretty scary and he takes a bite out of little kids! Set 27 years after the original all of the kids the losers club has grown up and moved only strangely after a call all return to the small Maine town to reunite and you guessed it face the evil clown himself. The cast has memories of yesterday and their fright moments of childhood as the flashback scenes capture culture and times of the 80's and 90's so well with the clothes, movies, music and other things. The cast chemistry is all pro with Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, and Bill Hader. Overall okay horror sequel that's long and lengthy with flashback frights and scary memories.",6,0,0,12 September 2019
American Gangster," In depth crime drama that stays well bottled up in it's own period of violence, power, and corruption.
","'American Gangster' is clearly a film that stands as one of those classic time pieces of power and shows it's culture very strong. Directed by Ridley Scott who shows so much power and greed in this drama as it showcases the rise of power of real-life 1970's Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington) and the struggles of a conflicted cop Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe). The contrast is typical good guy against bad yet the viewer sees both as conflicted as Roberts a divorced cop with his own problems of women and commitment while Lucas is seen enjoying success as a family man from illegal means as he makes his fortune thru smuggling heroin from Southeast Asia. Really a good cop like film that captured the time and culture of the 70's well by showing the rise of the street drug culture really the film brings back memories of 'The French Connection'. As typical with gangster films this is filled with greed, blood, and most of all corruption. The performances are strong from both titans Crowe and Washington as this was really a good culture film that stays bottled up so well in it's 70's time frame yet it ends in my opinion showing corruption showcased as a champion like theme which has became so common in our money hungry culture.",6,1,7,3 November 2007
The Reader," A passionate and steamy love affair that last in memory even when times of guilt and the arrival of truth is discovered.
","'The Reader' is without a doubt an emotional love story that spans thru time and memory as it shows how it can affect and shape the life of one young man. This type of film may not be everyone's cup of tea, yet I for one found it's themes of love, along with the hot and sexy steamy love making scenes, rounding out with the trial after war time that arrives at painful guilt and truth discovery to be compelling and interesting, as 'The Reader' is just the type of film to draw the complete attention of a viewer. To add to that the performance of Kate Winslet the lead lady of the film is portrayed to perfection as her role of an older lady who's clearly a seducer is a real treasure to watch.'The Reader' which was based on a novel is set in postwar Germany and it chronicles the life of one Michael Berg(Ralph Finnes)from the tender age of 15 till his life up in the mid 1990's. Starting with Michael being ill he meets Hanna Schmitz(Kate Winslet)one day as after Michael is helped home and upon his recovery he again journeys back to see Hanna. Yet he will discover that Hanna is twice his age, yet despite his tender age of 15 Michael is drawn into a very hot and steamy passionate love affair with her(I must say the love scenes were well done and Kate shows plenty of skin). Michael being a schoolboy and Hanna who works as a train ticket conductor keep their physical romance a secret, yet Michael discovers Hanna has one passion and that is she loves for him to read stories and poetry to her(Oddly enough Hanna herself is illiterate)and this skillful fun only deepens their passion for one another. Then the film shifts one day as Hanna leaves causing Michael to be heartbroken.Eight years later while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he will make a surprising discovery as sitting in the courtroom back in his life is Hanna who's on trial as a defendant for war crimes. Hanna does not defend herself even though she feels she done nothing wrong you as the viewer really wonder about it if she feels any guilt or not. As it goes on Michael's feelings of the past become more and more intense as memories of love and passion never die even in hard and harsh times of guilt and regret.Really this film was well directed and paced by Stephen Daldry as it really is a haunting epic about how even the truth and guilt intersects with love proving memories can stand time from generation to generation even though it's impacted by war crimes. Overall 'The Reader' is clearly a watch in my opinion for the messages and themes it sends out like love, passion, coming of age, regret, and most of all proving that everyone has memories and that nothing can stop anyone from remembering good times like passionate love even though it didn't last. Also with the performance from Kate Winslet the film is even much more memorable for her bold and brave performance as her characters risk taking style was one to be remembered.",9,2,2,15 February 2009
Jaws," A film classic one of my favorites. Well done suspense adventure and very memorable pulsating original score. Spielberg's best.
","'Jaws' a film that I've viewed many times over the years is one of my favorites, it's clearly one of the 70's best and probably one of cinemas all time best films ever made. As well before the days of special effects, CGI, and 3-D Spielberg did his best making this film with scenes of a mechanical shark. And the film is suspense filled as most scenes don't show the shark directly attacking the victims, yet it's often the things that are hidden and underneath that are the most terrifying like an underwater great white. And most memorable is the pulsating original theme score from the film, you've heard it many times as it just carries the suspense and drama of the film along so well.Based on Peter Benchley's novel(I must say a must read)'Jaws' is set in a New England northeastern island resort town of Amity. And all of a sudden unexpected bodies float ashore and deaths are reported. And the worst fears of the ocean have come to service a great white shark is responsible. So enter the town's sheriff stressed out Chief Brody(wonderfully played by Roy Scheider)and upon his assumptions and investigations he's meet with resistance and protest from the town mayor Mr. yes man and the politically corrupt Mayor Vaughn(well done by Murray Hamilton)as it's better to lie about shark attacks to the citizens for fear of losing money as people will not want to vacation in Amity if reports of shark attacks are true. Brody does the best to cope with it with support from wife Ellen(Lorraine Gary).Still matters need to be taken further so enter two problem solver helpers one in the form of Sam Quint(Robert Shaw)a weathered and crazy odd ball shark hunter who's methods are unorthodox and then to complete the twosome it's young hotshot educated marine scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss). And along the way this film turns into a suspenseful adventure of shark hunting that's helped by the wonderful and pulsating score it just keeps you on the edge of your seat, as in the end your happy to be served a big great white lunch with the death of Jaws! Overall a film classic one of the 70's better pictures and one of cinemas better suspense thrillers. Well remembered for it's strong and pulsating score which moved the drama and suspense of the film along so well. And the way the scenes were shot Spielberg made many of them hidden and suspenseful by doing them underwater proving what you can't see is most often the most dangerous just like the opening sequence of Chrissy's death. And the way that Steven shot the film even though tough and difficult by filming water scenes and moving the camera a lot on boat was well done and his working of the mechanical shark takes a big bite out of today's special effects and CGI and 3-D works. Really probably Steven Spielberg's best. 'Jaws' is a very memorable cinema classic, one of the all time best films.",10,6,11,5 December 2010
The Wrestler," Way to go Mickey! A touching film on your emotions due to it's themes of love and life struggles, and it proves that someone was meant to be a warrior.
","Hollywood always as you know if your an avid film fan loves a good comeback and it loves a classic movie tale of a down on his luck underdog. Well with this drama 'The Wrestler' which was greatly done by director Darren Aronofsky, it certainly stays true to form of art imitating life, as clearly this is the comeback of Mickey Rourke and without a doubt ranks as the performance of his lifetime. As after years of personal problems, bad movie choices, and other problems Rourke rightfully has landed a role he can relate to as his character is of the same breed a man on a comeback.Mickey is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson a New Jersey pro wrestler who was at one time a big attraction back during the 1980's, as you the viewer even feel nostalgic during the opening as you see the pro wrestling magazines, and pay per view promos, and 'The Ram' action figure, and plus you remember the heavy metal and big hair of the 80's also even Randy still has kept his Nintendo with the classic wrestling game some twenty years later. If you were a wrestling fan you can certainly relate to this pop culture nostalgia. Anyway glory days have passed Randy is old and washed up and down on his luck, he now must make his appearances with a traveling circuit of wrestlers in the minor leagues by doing shows at local high schools and local centers.Even though on the downside Randy still entertains and give fans their bucks worth by hurting with pain by bleeding and suffering. Still he's like the energizer bunny he keeps going and going! Still even though enjoying his work, his life economically and personally seems to be going backwards as he struggles to pay rent and his only enjoyment is going to the local strip club to see a favorite of his Cassidy(Marisa Tomei who treats us to plenty of skin). To complicate matters he suffers a heart attack during a small time match as finally the nightly grind of blows, cuts, and bruises has caught up with him. He is advised to end his wrestling days by a doctor.Slowly he tries to start a new life by working as a supermarket meat cutter, and finally he reunites with an only daughter Stephanie(a good supporting turn from Evan Rachel Wood) he had forsaken at an early age, yet sadly she wants nothing to do with him. So Randy then sees the light as clearly his identity was not meant to be that of a supermarket clerk and he tries to start a romance with Cassidy. Still his true passion is and has always been buried deep inside of him it's the ring that he must return to and one last go around is in store for him.Really what more can I say this film will really touch your emotions for the way it shows the struggles of life and love. And it's a must see for the super performance of Mickey Rourke it was very powerful and touching as his character of 'Randy the Ram' is one underdog you cheer and feel for. And Tomei is in top form as a likable and very sexy stripper, as always Marisa does beautiful work. 'The Wrestler' is a must see it's a deep and moving emotional drama of a comeback of the human heart and spirit and it was good to see Mickey back to work really in his finest form. It shows that it was meant that a good warrior never stays down for the count.",9,0,1,1 February 2009
Dark Shadows," Blood is thicker than water, a fang of a good time! Excellent take on the Gothic classic.
","I for one am one of the biggest Tim Burton fans the man who brought us the classics 'Batman'(1989) and 'Batman Returns'(1992)really blends emotions and the inner feelings to make excellent movies. As his dark and Gothic mood tone will make any viewer enchanted. And with this work an update and more modern version of the TV soap 'Dark Shadows' Tim clearly did not let anyone down! 'Dark Shadows' is an excellent take and spin on the Gothic classic and Tim's story is filled with a journey and search for family and love plus the comedy and horror mix make the film very interesting to anyone. And the film is a pop culture piece for the way it blends music and style of it's setting of 1972 it's a rock and roll all night good time. As anyone knows who watches Burton's movies they are full of fun and expressions always revealing inner feelings and emotions his works can really change one's view of the world. And the all star cast makes the film work even more as two Tim favorites Johnny Depp(Barnabas Collins)and Michelle Pfeiffer(Elizabeth Collins Stoddard)shine with star power.The film has a story in a historical and Gothic kind of way starting in 1752 in Liverpool, England a young Barnabas(Depp)suffers some fatal tragedies at the hands of a curse put out by a sexy yet jealous witch Angelique Bouchard(Eva Green). Yet after many many decades of being buried the film flashes to it's present day of 1972 and the culture is captured in the film perfect by the use of 70's music and style as the furniture and the clothing from the 70's is noticeable. And a nice little appearance from 70's legend Alice Cooper is A okay. And Barnabas meets his ancestral descendants that being the wealthy and rich Collins family of Collinsport, Maine a seaside and shoreline fishing community as this business has brought the Collins clan their millions. Yet arriving is a mysterious girl Victoria Winters/Josette(Bella Heathcote) who becomes a guest to the Colins family and this arrival has pleased Barnabas. The bad news is the sexy yet wicked witch but breakable beauty Angelique(Eva Green)has arrived in town with her curse. To help both defeat the wicked witch is the Collins Stoddard family as Michelle Pfeiffer is elegant and sexy in a classic kind of way and in top notch form as family head leader Elizabeth and true this a strange bunch as Elizabeth's daughter Carolyn(Chloe Grace Moretz) is a certain little hand full and family head doctor Julia Hoffman(Helena Bonham Carter) needs medication herself.Overall this horror comedy drama is full of laughs, love, culture, and searching for belonging and acceptance still it closes the historical Gothic story out to a happy ending. The performances from Depp and Pfeiffer were top notch and perfect and again Tim sends a message and he proves with this film that family and belonging is important and too it's okay to be different! 'Dark Shadows' was one feel good viewing pleasure.",10,11,25,11 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The start of darkness and the birth of light and a new hope!
","Of the three prequels Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith is one that ends and sets up the way for Star Wars a New Hope just perfect due to the fact that it shapes the story with the birth of central characters and the start of an evil being of darkness. Picking up years after the clone wars the Jedi Knights Obi-Wan and Anakin still have to finish a battle with the evil dark federation all in the meantime a major shakeup will happen with young Skywalker. As now the fate has finally came true Anakin takes a turn to evil, yet even more important is the fact that Anakin has gotten his love Padme pregnant and she has twins before she leaves the galaxy and these two little people are gonna be pretty important people later on in the force! Overall pretty good film that reveals some major developments.",8,3,5,19 December 2015
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," One of my favorites, maybe Disney's all time best. It proves that beauty defeats the wicked. Heigh-Ho!
","From having watched this classic as a kid and to just recently viewing it, I must say that this picture is a timeless classic. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is an excellent moral tale of good against evil, it's a historical film as it was Disney's first full feature animated tale and it's paced along perfect with songs and uplifting scores. This film could be classified as a musical too.Originating from a Grimms tale this is a magical moral story that will entertain one of any age as it's message is timeless. The story centers around a beautiful and kindhearted princess named Snow White and shamefully she is forced to be a working slave that scrubs floors and all this comes from her wicked and jealous stepmother the Queen. Still that doesn't hide the charm that this princess has as she charms every creature in the kingdom. Interesting and somewhat of a fortune telling experiment is the Magic mirror telling the Queen that Snow White is the fairest one of all. This enrages the Queen as she has deadly plans for Snow White so it's time for this little princess to get away.Snow White goes on an uncertain journey adventure fleeing into the forest where she meets cute animals and later she befriends the odd and strange but lovable seven dwarfs named Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Sleepy and Dopey. Lessons are learned and love is developed as these little guys learn to be neat and clean and whistle and 'Heigh-Ho' while they work at an old diamond mine! Only a favor is returned to Snow White as the Queen's wicked transformation is pushed over a cliff with help from her seven friends. And a nice beautiful return to life from the deadly apple is provided in the form of the prince's kiss. And they live happily ever after in this wonderful fairy tale.Overall one of Disney's best a good moral tale of good against evil proving that friendship helps and that beauty will win over the wicked. And the animation work was among Disney's earliest this is a highly memorable classic to be enjoyed with a loved one. So 'Heigh-Ho'.",10,2,2,14 December 2010
Shooter," Good action drama. With a great plot and a big twist of conspiracy and corruption.
","'Shooter' so far has to be one of the best movies, I've seen of 2007 due to it's interesting plot and well paced action. The story is good you have Mark Wahlberg as an ex-marine and experienced marksman who is one day called in by some former associates to conduct a supposed assassination on the president only to have him prevent it! Well this is a big frame up by corrupt government people especially ring leader federal man played by movie vet Danny Glover. So then the attempt is to unmask the real assassins of an archbishop and not the intended president! And the framing begins as the government tries to prove the bullet came from the Wahlberg characters weapon, leading to a wild chase from Philadelphia to Kentucky and Virgina and ending up in the nations capital for a climax. And plenty of fun is experienced watching this movie with it's action and will to survive and it was good to see Ned Beatty as a corrupt U.S. senator who's in on the benefit of schemes to help his power. This is a likable film due to the action and acting of Wahlberg and it does a good job of showing about government corruption and right-wing federal conspiracies. It gives hope that real justice like that of the old west or Rambo style needs to be brought back to the real world. Hopefully this film can also spark a new franchise for Mark.",8,3,8,23 March 2007
Sherlock Holmes," A roll along adventure with a different take on the legendary crime fighting figure.
","I for one was never a die hard Holmes fan, yet over the years as a kid I would on occasion read some of the literature of the legendary figure. As seen here director Guy Ritchie who had a much different take on Sherlock showing him more as an action and karate fighting warrior who still has crime solving skills. Anyway it's setting is in typical fashion of 1880's London you find Holmes(in a bold and fun performance from Robert Downey Jr.)as a mysterious master of disguise and clue sniffing problem solver who leaps out of buildings and fights crime with his bare knuckles just like an action super hero. In a good yet whimsical supporting role is Sherlock's good friend and sidekick Dr. Watson(Jude Law)as both carry on like old classmates, yet still serious they both have one goal in common and that's to rid London of the evil and mysterious magical Lord Blackwood(Mark Strong).Along the way this is a film of fun fighting thrill ride chases and fun entertainment even though it seems a little exhausting as this take on Holmes shows him more of a brutal and intense brawler than as expected the norm of a book solving wizard. Introduced as an interesting thorn to the film is an ex love of Holmes that is Irene Adler(Rachel McAdams)who's a sneaky and manipulative dame in such an old fashioned Victorian way that you don't know if to take her as a good princess or evil witch type. Overall this film isn't the best I've seen yet it's explosive pace makes it a franchise because the character is enriched in great storytelling and history so this film is certainly the start of something special so enjoy it's new look and clever ways of an iconic mystery fighting figure.",7,0,0,13 January 2010
WALL·E," Well done. Nice and clever work again from Pixar. Marvelous feature.
","I for one have never been a big fan of animation or cartoon type films, yet something just interested me about 'WALL-E' it just seemed like a nice and cute touching tale of a lonely moving robot about to start his journey thru the planet. I must say after seeing it that I wasn't letdown either overall it was pretty impressive work everything from graphics to the style of it's story with the fantasy characters living in cool settings. Starting in a rusty desert of junk where the only living thing that moves is square robot 'WALL-E' who has such catchy and droopy binocular eyes. Much of the first parts of the film we see the robot as stubborn and alone as the action and journey of discovery doesn't really take off till he meets up with a landed spaceship and another ray eyed robot 'EVE'. This movie is clearly a film of discovery a new type of journey that involves future themes of space and saving humans with the central hero being a robot a lifelike possibility with the technology of the future as machines and droids may soon rule the planet. This may not be your cup of tea yet no matter your age check it out you''ll have a fun and mind exploring time watching it.",8,2,5,7 July 2008
Arrival," A space type film of investigations and questions it makes you think and challenges in an intellect way.
","Going in to watch 'Arrival' you might expect a little 'Mars Attacks', 'Star Wars,' or even 'Star Trek' after seeing it you compare it more to 'Gravity' or a 'Deep Horizon' kind of film. Still the movie in my opinion nothing excellent still entertains as it challenges the mind of the viewer the questions of space, man, and life and how it interacts with the globe and other forms of life.The plot is pretty simple an odd mystery type of spacecraft touches the globe and all of a sudden the military community wants answers is the universe on verge of a global war? How does it apply to life and humanity? So is it possible to have communications with alien life? Now enter Dr. Banks(Amy Adams)who's a linguist expert and she's sent on an expert mission with other military officials and Ian(Jeremy Renner)to find answers and see what life holds thru other forms and if communication is the way to go get answers and find safety.Overall this film is more of a challenge of intellect with a lot of questions which some are answered and others posed are questions of mystery about present wonders of alien life and hint at a global war also being served on the table, so give this film a watch for yourself and be the judge.",7,0,5,14 November 2016
The Blind Side," A feel good real life fairy tale. That's carried by the tough love performance of Sandra Bullock(her best ever)
","'The Blind Side' is certainly a touching story and what makes it more compelling is it's based on a true story. Even though these miracles only happen in life rarely it did in this case with Michael Oher an orphaned teen who goes on to athletic stardom by getting drafted to the NFL. Yet 'The Blind Side' is more than a story of a down on his luck kid that rises to fame, it's main showcase is the tough love of Leigh Anne Tuohy(played to perfection by Sandra Bullock her best performance ever)Sandy really steals the show.Based on the true story of Michael Oher(Quinton Aaron)who's orphaned from a young age by having a runaway day and a drug addicted mother. He's grown up in a life of the hood and projects his only hope and escape is that a family member has contacted and wedged a local Memphis, TN high school(Wingate)to see his potential as this kid is big as a mountain he certainly has the size to be a powerful lineman. Oher enrolls yet he's awkward not well educated in the books and still homeless only by happens chance while walking along a road one night he's spotted by a family. This family happens to be the Tuohys a well to do wealthy conservative republican family who rank as the class of Memphis, TN. It's when the backbone of the clan Leigh Anne(Bullock) says right in front of her two children and husband Sean(nice appearance by Tim McGraw)to pull over and take the boy home as her children have noticed him from school.The adaptation is tough at first only to narrowly grow as one by one they get to know Michael and Leigh Anne with her good Christian heart decides that the Tuohys will become his newly legally adopted family. Along the way growing pains are expected but never fear with this families resources Michael is educated and learns a lot as his book skills improve. Still Michael is odd showing no interest in girls yet his one to be discovered talent is playing left tackle on the football team. As his power and god given ability is well showcased in the film. Yet all along his desire to do well comes from his new loving family the Tuohys who give him inspiration mostly Leigh Anne who struts her stuff in memorable scenes by telling Michael on the scrimmage field how to block by giving him words of encouragement. Plus Leigh stands up to her elegant and rich snob female friends at dinner who make fun of her for adopting a black boy.All of this standing tall love and support lead to Michael getting recruited to play college ball at Ole Miss(where the Tuohys went to school). Then after that journey Michael is drafted by The NFL's Baltimore Ravens and he's currently their starting rookie left tackle. Really this film does have a little to much hyperbole and even though it's real and compelling it's a fairy tale story that's slim even though these stories happen they are far and few in between. Still the wild card and film backbone is Sandra Bullock(Sandy is so good with the southern accent) who's near perfect in her portrayal of Mrs. Tuohy who's such a good hearted and nice Christian southern woman. It proves with a strong mother figure who gives tough love, caring, and support a young man can be molded into not only something great but something special and become a grown man. 'The Blind Side' is hyperbole and a real fairy tale type that showcases a feel good story of a man coming of age by finding out what a loving family brings. And most important It doesn't blind our feelings of tough love as Sandra Bullock's strong and direct southern belle performance proves a mother figure is so important.",8,6,12,5 December 2009
Parasite," Clever plot that twist with a surprise call it good verus bad, rich against poor, overall great film!
","Director Bong Joon-Ho really did it with his latest picture 'Parasite' as it is one entertaining dark suspense drama that is revealing as the plot twist with a surprise which brings change for all of the characters. Despite reading subtitles the film is thrilling and entertaining as it involves the poor Ki-taek family who have a young boy and girl who become tutors to the kids of the wealthy Park family only a scheme really lies underneath it all only an incident happens and a discovery changes the game for all, still the Ki-taek family is stubborn and proud as they will do anything to survive. Overall good take and spin on class that's supported by shrewdness, suspense, intrigue, drama, and pumping black heart like comedy. 'Parasite' by far by the way it entertains and grabs you was one of 2019's best films.",9,17,26,21 January 2020
Rango," Animation that's fun off beat and different it's the 'Rango' way!
","'Rango' is one of those movies that's fun, different, unique and off beat it tells it's story in a different way really it's animation and computer graphics and CGI use at it's best. And true animation and big screen cartoons aren't my favorite type of films still every now and then these type of pictures are worth a watch. 'Rango' tells a wild west story of good against evil the up and coming lawman and the bad mayor with cowboys and it has a theme pattern of 'High Noon' and 'True Grit' only it's done in animation! Yet it has the stars in it they just look different as characters in the wild west town of dirt. Johnny Depp is just fine and the beauty Isla Fisher plays a damsel in distress she even has a scene where she's tied up and gagged! Overall an okay little treat movie that's fun and unique to check out.",8,0,0,26 September 2014
Music and Lyrics," Somewhat of a career rebirth, but most of all a discovery of love.
","'Music and Lyrics' is overall a fine and OK fun-filled romantic comedy with a blend of laughs that doesn't take things serious, yet still entertains. You have Hugh Grant as a washed up 80's pop star trying to make a comeback, and by happens chance he meets a NYC freelance plant waterer who's played by Drew Barrymore and slowly the two hit things off. The Barrymore character helps out by working with an upcoming teen pop princess, who has lyrics to help out as the Grant character just needs to supply the music to make a hit comeback. Mostly thru this movie isn't just really about the music business even though it ends with a produced hit, it's a movie of a relationship that grows into love and caring from two characters that were down on their luck. Also the chemistry between Grant and Barrymore is just fine these two should work together more. Really this film is entertaining and a little fun, but nothing really serious or special.",5,1,4,17 February 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Michael Keaton's best performance ever! It's a bird life and bird on the brain!
","Finally saw 'Birdman' and I must say that it was a pleasure a film that was entertaining and a joy, as Michael Keaton does fly and soar in this role of past his prime actor Riggan Thomas. I always liked Keaton in my opinion he was the best 'Batman' ever Michael always had range and depth with his acting choices, and with this he nails the best performance of his life! Keaton plays Riggan Thomas a past his prime washed up actor who after many years of success starring in a superhero franchise called 'Birdman' decides to fold the tent on the role. And now Riggan has taken up life on the Broadway circuit making a living as a stage actor in plays. And Riggan's life is a mess he's divorced and he deals with a march to the beat of her own drum daughter named Sam(Emma Stone)who's just got out of drug rehab. And while working on the play Riggan has conflicts and personal clash problems with his co stars first up is the arrogant and playboy type method actor Mike(Edward Norton)and Mike is hitting on Riggan's daughter Sam and also he's trying to put moves on fellow co star and play cast member the emotional and cute colored bra wearing Lesley(Naomi Watts). Thru it all Riggan is dealing with family and his critics and his ego, and most of a challenge is how 'The Birdman' memory haunts him Riggan hears voices and has visions of his once beloved superhero character. Overall this film entertains and is one that shows life is a challenge when you try to overcome people, and ego still if you have good memories on the mind it can help you soar to new heights in life just like that of one Riggan Thomas.",8,3,11,16 November 2014
The Big Short," A showcase and fun tease of insider trading at it's best, showing the greed of the world.
","Everyone remembers the housing bubble and financial collapse of the mid 2000's certainly 2007 and 2008 as the news made shock waves. Yet most revealing was how the government and the finance world of corporate insider trading became the norm with a scheme to get rich with greed as collections were made when the housing market would crumble. 'The Big Short' is a film that is a showcase of this and true it might have fun showing greed still it's a film that stings with guilt and conscious as you see many hard working people lose it all from money to homes all the big corporate people and inside investors profit from their losses. As the insider traders have a world of finance credit and housing bubble greed that's all tied to the big banks. The film seems real like and made to be believed with the work from actors Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, and Ryan Gosling. 'The Big Short' is one showcase that even though is a tease it proves that it's good not to put trust in government, banks, or finance companies as the little guys get crushed showing the world as one big corrupt mess.",8,2,8,23 December 2015
Platoon," Raw and brutal. Great work from Oliver Stone it shows the emotions, anger, and violence of war.
","Director Oliver Stone drawing on his own experience from his days as a solider in Vietnam, scores a big hit here in 1986 with 'Platoon' a brutal war drama with conflict about. Chris Taylor(Charlie Sheen) is a young man who's dropped out of college for the love of his country so he goes off to fight in Vietnam. Of course the big enemy is the Viet Cong, yet so much more is at stake and much is learned during this brutal tour. This film is just perfect the way it shows how intense and brutal war can be, as evidenced by the bloody and ambush attack scenes, as a viewer can feel the hurt, pain and exhaustion of the soldiers. This platoon company has plenty of conflicts, differences of opinion, and culture problems all within themselves. Those themes and problems make this film all the more important as the viewer will come to value life just like the central character of Chris Taylor. The performances given from Sheen is good but fails in comparison to his two commanding officers played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, especially Berenger's is outstanding because he's so direct and serious. You will find plenty of pot smoking, foul language, and death with this picture, but that's just typical stuff in war. After it all a viewer should feel proud to a solider and hold them in high value because they help provide our countries freedom of life. Great film and well deserving of the 1986 best picture.",8,0,1,28 May 2007
Halloween," A classic, genre defining. Timeless it still frightens after almost three decades.
","'Halloween' is by far the most genre defining classic horror film of the modern age. I first saw the film probably in the mid 80's when I was still young, this is a special film to me for two reasons one it was released in 1978 the year I was born, and second it was one of the first horror films I saw. Good story here for a horror film, you have Michael Myers escaped mental patient who after being away for years, returns home to his Midwestern town on Halloween night to terrorize the town as a psychotic murderer. This time Michael focuses his attention mostly on young teenage girls, a hobby he still remembers from the murder of his sister years ago. This film introduces us to scream-queen and later Hollywood legend Jamie Lee Curtis who is terrific as baby sitter Laurie Strode, one of the few that gets to stay alive! Donald Pleasence is great as the determined but yet worried Dr. Loomis who tracks Michael's every move! Also John Carpenter must be given most of the credit for the way he directed this film with the camera angles, and his use of dark shadows and the way he hides Michael Myers around corners, it's what you can't see that frightens, then no look out he comes out of the darkness! Most of the music and the score of the film is great, probably one of the best for a horror film. The score is pulsating from start to finish which was done by John Carpenter himself this music just gets under your skin. Watching this film thru the years it was finally good to get the 25th anniversary edition on DVD, the special features disc is good with information many didn't know. You find things out like the film was done in California even though portrayed in Illinois, plus Carpenter's father was music department director at Western Kentucky University, and finally just how cheap the Michael Myers mask cost! John Carpenter changed the shape of terror forever believe me this is why many young girls will not baby sit today! Also many horror films have tried to mimic this but have failed, this is simply and always will be the granddaddy of horror flicks of the modern day, a timeless classic that will never get old.",10,1,2,30 March 2006
Wonder Woman," Not Lynda Carter's 'Wonder Woman', but still a good origin story.
","This latest take on 'Wonder Woman' is full of visuals and big screen action as it's a coming of age story for one determined woman thru training and learning skill to save people and fight evil during war time. And it's clear that it's not like the 70's classic old school Lynda Carter take on 'Wonder Woman'. Still director Patty Jenkins does try to showcase the lead as a champion for all women. Story is pretty simple during war war 1 a plane crash off of the Amazon island leads to the discover of Steve Trevor(Chris Pine)and Diana Princess is off on her way to help fight for justice and freedom as the new trained warrior called 'Wonder Woman'(Gal Gadot). This movie is a spin of action, freedom, and coming of age with love in the air overall good look at the origin of a D.C. comic book character.",6,2,9,4 June 2017
Carrie," Well done horror film that showcases the different and highlights revenge.
","Brian DePalma's 1976 horror thriller based on Stephen King's novel is a well done film that has theme of feeling different and it proves that an outcast can have the most fun and revenge in the end. This film entertains to the end it's an ultimate revenge story.The story has Carrie White(in a top performance from Sissy Spacek)who's a bullied and picked on and mocked tormented girl as she gets it in droves from her classmates as the leader of the pack is Chris(the sexy Nancy Allen)a rude cheerleader type who's so cruel. Also out of this supporting cast of mean teenagers look for Amy Irving, P.J. Soles, William Katt, and John Travolta all in early roles for themselves. Also on the other side Carrie is tormented and treated bad by her crazy and religious freak mother Margaret(Piper Laurie). Carrie has no friends no hope she's an outcast well the one little thing she has going for her is the secret powers of being telekinetic as she can move objects, move people and even start fires.Finally when all around Carrie go to far with the mocked encounters and humiliation Carrie then takes her powers of vengeance to new levels and new highs a powerhouse moment as this special gift cause hell and a firestorm of a good time at her high school prom! Overall this is a wonderful film of blood, fire, revenge, and getting even as the film is straight to the point and cast chemistry is in top form, as 'Carrie' is clearly a horror classic.",9,1,2,28 June 2016
Marriage Story," A film that will make one feel sad and gloom, still the performances and story is direct and honest.
","Just watched 'Marriage Story' and this film shows that life and love between a husband and wife can be complicated and painful and it's very hurtful when it has to end. In fact director Noah Baumbach based this on his real life marriage break up. This film is really a strong drama about the going down the drain of a marriage between Nicole(Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie(Adam Driver) and they have a young son named Henry and that makes things even tougher.The couple split their time between both coast as Charlie wants to stay in New York with his theater productions, and Nicole wants to go stay in sunny L.A. and be a free spirited actress, yet oddly this is the plan and the best way they feel to divorce and uncouple. And the process is tough and raw actually sometimes painful to watch. Enter the wild cards that being the lawyers to help steer thru the rocky waves. Watch Laura Dern shine as a tough yet smart elegant divorce attorney named Nora.This picture shows how all involved are affected and the damage that a divorce does it's like an ever lasting wound since a kid is involved. The chemistry and acting was great from both Adam and Scarlett yet the wild card was the performance from Laura as she was like a shining queen who sparkled with every take.",6,0,3,9 December 2019
The Queen," A decent historical and docudrama film that's crafted well with actual real life highlights and flashbacks of a royal tragedy.
","Stephen Frears certainly did a fine job here with this very well and informative docudrama historical type film. As you watch and you as the viewer feel the pain and loss of Princess Diana from the actual highlights and flashbacks of actual news reels shown during the film. Yet Dame Helen Mirren leads the way with her performance as Queen Elizabeth II as her performance is tough and believable. The film shows the conflict of the public tragedy of the sudden death of Diana and the attitudes of traditional bound Elizabeth and new Prime Minister Tony Blair who wants a new modern image carries the film most of the time. True in it's nature you as the viewer see the private chambers of the Royal family and the British government as it's seen in it's darkest hour. James Cromwell also gives a strong supporting performance here too. 'The Queen' is well blended as a film of government and royal conflict yet the flashbacks of Princesss Diana show the pain and tragedy that's lead to the conflict, really Stephen Frears blended it so well his direction is top notch it worked well with Mirren's life like performance. 'The Queen' is clearly one of the better historical docudrama types of significant interest for any film and history buff fan.",7,0,1,14 April 2008
1408," A mini mix blend of 'The Shining' and 'The Bates Motel' that causes screams!
","I must say '1408' is a well done ghost story of the mind and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. John Cusack is a California ghost writer, who has a unique hobby of traveling the country investigating reports of ghosts in legendary hotels. His work includes spending the night to disprove the theories. Well once he learns about the Dolphin Hotel in New York city it has room 1408 he's now in the big leagues of ghost and terror. The scenes of ghosts, shadows, voices, dreams, are similar and bring viewers to think of hotel terror classics like 'The Shining' and 'Psycho'. The countdown for life is monitored by the clock alarm radio that will countdown from 60 minutes till 0! This film is great mind terror a real good head trip that makes the viewer think is it a dream or real. Overall well done it provides screams like a roller coaster, a viewer is on the edge of their seat.",8,2,4,23 June 2007
Raging Bull," Beautifully done. The rise and fall of a destructive human champ.
","'Raging Bull' clearly ranks as one of the better films of all-time due to it's compelling story of the rise but yet human tragedy downfall at the end. At it's time when done in 1980 the cinematography was fabulous the film's black and white take was a neat and nice concept. Plus the master Martin Scorsese does a fine job with the directing as his theme of character study and development into downfall is perfectly done. Robert DeNiro gives a tough and fired up performance as former real life and ex boxer middleweight Jake LaMotta, the film showcases Jake's life and career from the early 1940's till his washed up downfall as a low rent club owning stand up comedian in the early 1960's. The scenes are memorable not just the boxing ones but, the scenes of rage and blow ups from the LaMotta character and the viewer can see just how the impact and scandal of the mob impacted boxing in the early days. Joe Pesci gives a strong performance as LaMotta's brother Joey he always gives encouragement and advice in an aggressive and upbeat manner, really one of the better supporting roles I've seen done in film nice work Mr. Pesci. This film really is a great character study of rage, anger, and obsession just wanting to make your dream happen, but it proves many times that a downfall in the end happens it can be sad and tragic. Overall good work from all involved especially Scorsese and DeNiro with a great supporting turn from Pesci.",7,2,5,7 July 2007
Fifty Shades of Grey," Plenty of skin and body it shows sexual games to new heights!
","Saw pretty early on the much buzzed about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' film I wanted to even though I hadn't read any of the E.L. James novels. Well I must say for the most part I was impressed as the film did have a story and it tried it's best to show relationship and chemistry between the two characters as it did deliver on it's theme showcase of plenty of sex, skin, bondage, and domination it was plenty for the eyes! A good film if you like to see little sex games! I guess the story in the books are much the same, anyway a college student Anastasia Steele(Dakota Johnson)a virgin is a girl getting ready to start to life out in the real world of work and relationship well that gets off to a big lift when she meets a business guy named Christian Grey(Jamie Dornan)the passion and seduction soon begins. As it's a take flight romance of control and hot sexual games that features bondage, rope, blindfolds and tie ups for Anastasia. Even though the scenes are not X they still are hot and go deep for an R picture with the nudity and skin! This picture sends a message that all of us have a sexual nature and a side domination and control that needs to be discovered and enjoyed with someone it proves that being erotic can lead to love.",8,13,28,14 February 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Explosive, a masterpiece that's filled with tension, doubt, political and culture uncertain. A strong way to end the Nolan trilogy.
","I must say that after watching 'The Dark Knight Rises' one will feel entertained, surprised, and full of emotion and a split between happiness and sadness. Really this film ends a revolution as under the direction of Nolan this franchise clearly got a high tech and more darker and modern day reboot as it all started as an origin story and ends in an explosive closure. Also with the 'Dark Knight Rises' you can clearly see the themes of political and societal upheaval, and class warfare along with the central character Batman(Bale)who has to battle his own personal and spiritual demons, now that's epic stuff for a superhero film. Yet this is a modern Batman in a modern world of anxiety and doubt.Take away those themes and still this is a wonderful superhero movie set about eight years after Batman's battle with the Joker and the death of Harvey Dent. We find Bruce Wayne/Batman(Christian Bale)hid away in his rich big lonely mansion and he still wants to be the Bat even if Gotham doesn't want to accept him. And butler and sidekick Alfred(Michael Caine)wants a new world for mister Wayne too. Only this is the world of the not normal and strange it's soon that Gotham and Commissioner Gordon(Gary Oldman)once again shine the light as it's time for another Batman calling. Enter the brute and thug the masked Bane(Tom Hardy)a man who will use terror means and pure force and power to destroy the city. This is one challenge that the dark knight will be broken down with both mentally and physically. And this villain has a connected past to Wayne/Batman.In nice subplots and supporting turns for this epic tale is the eager work of an up and coming young cop Blake(Joseph Gordon Levitt)who just might be waiting in the wings for a superhero cape! And before and after Bruce dons the cape again he's attracted to a sexy and clever vamp named Selina Kyle/Catwoman(the sexy Anne Hathaway)which really for Bruce with his also split life turns out to be a better female love than the rich cold hearted and secretive Miranda(Marion Cotillard).Yet thru it all 'The Dark Knight Rises' is one emotional blast of high tech action and moral drama filled with tension and chaos as this explosive third chapter puts some closure to Nolan's trilogy, still the film's ending leaves many split as to what they think really happens to Bruce Wayne/Batman either way what you think Nolan wants you to form your own conclusion as the dust has settled on his take of an extraordinary legend that will long long live with us.",9,3,8,30 July 2012
Black Panther," A film of action, hype, and inner family and country conflict.
","Really don't watch much of 'Marvel' stuff, more of a 'D.C.' guy still checked out the hyped and ever grossing 'Black Panther' and the film entertained and was filled with some drama, still it wasn't one of my favorite hero films. After the death of the king young T' Challa(Chadwick Boseman) is faced with the test of putting his country and family first against the world. His own nation is high tech and as the new king fractions of family and war with sibling rival make this film somewhat of an interesting drama with a good turn from Michael B. Jordan. Overall an okay film with special effects and good action fight scenes that involve CGI also.",6,2,3,9 February 2019
Iron Man," Explosive and well informed film that's shows the action as raw and gritty. And that's suits this flawed action hero just fine!
","'Iron Man' is clearly not as well known to the masses like 'Superman' or 'Batman' yet still this is a superhero that's interesting and his character flaws make him likable as Tony Stark/Iron Man comes with no boyishness or glower he's just all action packed business! Robert Downey Jr. with his troubled past and rocky personal life was well suited to play a flawed and hard living character like Tony Stark. Stark is a hard partying, womanizing, high tech celebrity weapons magnate who's loaded with money and lives the luxury of fame. Yet when he's wounded upon a trip to Afghanistan a raw and gritty transformation takes places as Stark becomes a hulking machine type rocket man! The film then shifts off to the great special effects we have became so used to in action movies, yet the theme of the character transformation so dominates the film from the development of his body chest suit, to the making of his clicking limbs and flamethrower arms all rounded out perfect when he's topped off by a medieval knight mask to become 'Iron Man'! Stark/Iron Man fooled his captures by constructing a cluster bomb they demanded only he built a mechanical alter ego to fly to freedom! And his goal is to destroy all weapons that he once created, as he now wants to fight for peace.The film is really a great characterization of a flawed man being transformed into a superhero even though the action and special effects are good. Supporting performances are well worth mention from Jeff Bridges as Stark's former friend but now evil corporate partner with his shaved head and beard intimidating. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts who's Tony selfless assistant and Paltrow gives a cute spark like twinkle to the role as the chemistry and sexual tension between her and Downey is well shown. Overall this isn't the greatest attempt at a superhero film clearly falling short from the feel and excitement and thrill of 'Batman' or let me say even 'Superman', yet still with Downey's performance and the action plus with the way it tells of the transformation of a flawed soul into a superhero most film watchers and comic fans are compensated in a grand way.",7,2,5,2 May 2008
Creed II," A knockout a revenge grudge match!
","'Creed II' delivers a knockout punch and the action in the ring gives the viewer something to cheer about. If you watch the 'Rocky' movies and know the story you know the past and how this chapter is connected to a happening from 'Rocky IV' in 1985. Now the son( Adonis) of the late Creed is set to fight the son of a former rival and foe now enter Viktor Drago. The movie is more than a boxing film it's a film of passion and emotion as it's about love, family, and life and winning at it all is possible thru hard work and determination and going thru pain when you get knocked down and hurt. Again Michael B. Jordan is in fine top shape form as the young Creed his performance again delivers a punch as it's a new jab and different uppercut of excitement for a new generation of 'Rocky' fans.",8,0,2,26 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A D.C. universe showcase in fact a little to much still a film of politics, fear, doubt, and saving the world.
","Always been a D.C. comics and movie fan especially Batman so I had to go out and see this mega film of a movie which is a springboard for future D.C. hero films that are in the works. And as expected this film is filled with plenty of action and high tech work and it's stretched out actually a little to long for a movie still it entertains the way an action movie should with good v the bad. And the name 'Dawn of Justice' can be a real name that rings true because anytime you have Batman and Superman out to fight for the same cause after facing off it's clearly a new dawn of justice. Plus the introduction of Wonder Woman(the beautiful Gal Gadot) was nice to see and it was long overdue, and the movie foreshadows at the arrival of Aquaman and in dream sequences Bruce and Clark see the coming of the evil 'Darkside'.Aside from the launching aspect of new characters and other projects the plot is still a battle to save the planet from evil and the threat is present in the form of an ego and power hungry Lex Luthor(Jesse Eisenberg)who's plot is to overtake the world and pit Batman against Superman as he wants both destroyed thru deception and tricks. And the performances and chemistry among cast is in top form as Ben Affleck holds his own as Batman and Henry Cavill flies high as Superman with the return of Amy Adams as miss Lane and Diane Lane is again good as Superman's mom. And interesting and a pleasure to see was Holly Hunter as a Kentucky U.S. Senator who's doubts Superman's real intentions seeing him as an antihero. Thru all the conflict and doubt and trauma from each's tormented past still the superhero element is present proving that good will still fight evil and save the day. This film is heavy and full of stuff and it leaves the D.C. universe door open for more as action and comic book fans can never get enough.",8,6,13,26 March 2016
Blade Runner," Underrated sci-fi classic. Cool and flashy and memorable photography and scenes.
","In 1982 Ridley Scott sure was on fire with this directing and take on showing a future look of Los Angeles. The cinematography and background scenes of this film are flashy, neat, and well done they make the film memorable. Especially when the viewer first glances and sees the streets and skyscrapers of L.A. and the screen of images on the sides of the big buildings. Set in 2019 in Los Angeles you have Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard a blade runner who's assigned to protect the city and future from criminals. This film is more than sci-fi you get to see a romance develop with Ford's character with a female named Rachel(Sean Young in an early role). Also performances from such names as Daryl Hannah, Edward James Olmos, and M. Emmet Walsh are worth a watch. Overall an underrated sci-fi classic good work from Ridley especially in 1982 for trying to show a future L.A. most memorable is the cinematography and flashy images of the background make this film such a classic.",8,2,4,15 July 2007
Bruce Almighty," Funny and filled with laughs. Neat and crazy concept to become the big man upstairs!
","Really one of the best and better movies of 2003, and maybe tying with 'Anger Mangement' as the funniest of 2003. Jim Carrey is at his best playing Bruce Nolan who's a down on his luck Buffalo, NY television reporter who's always picked on and overlooked for promotion. About the only thing Bruce can look forward to is his main squeeze Grace(Jennifer Aniston who's just as cute and sexy as ever!)then one day things get worse when he's canned from the station, then the depression sets in. Never fear though the unexpected happens when Bruce's cell phone rings and he answers it sending him to a empty building to meet the big guy himself you guessed it God! And Morgan Freeman plays him so graceful and in a classy way, anyway Bruce is given the role of becoming God! The special powers he acquires are great, they work to his advantage it gives him pleasure and fun while messing up and hurting others. Some scenes are funny like his parody of parting tomato soup in the diner just like 'The Red Sea', and his fishing and pulling of the moon's gravity. Finally in the end he becomes a god of love and caring by helping others and answering their needs and he finally becomes the successful reporter and lover he always wanted with help from up above. Steve Carell and Catherine Bell have cameos as news anchors. Overall as always great acting from Morgan Freeman and Jim Carrey is funny as ever in this funny and moral comedy a real winner.",7,0,2,20 June 2007
The Greatest Showman," An entertaining drama and musical of how show business came about.
","'The Greatest Showman' is one film that has themes of drama, doubt, struggle, and love and yet most of all it's a historical musical drama about how the legendary P.T. Barnum came about. As a kid you enjoy animals and the circus and enjoy sideshow attractions, well with this film you see how all of the makings and sideshow discovery things came about from one P.T. Barnum(Hugh Jackman).The movie despite having struggles of doubt, money concerns, and love drama is moved along just fine with great sounds of music as it's entertaining on the ears. And the growth along the way is seen of P.T. and his relationship with wife Charity(Michelle Williams).Overall this film is entertaining a good mix of sound with story that features drama and love and the performances from Jackman and Michelle is in top notch form as their screen chemistry makes this film a watch!",7,4,8,28 December 2017
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," An interesting and fun romantic drama that takes twist and unexpected turns in this crazy love triangle!
","Woody Allen always one known for his offbeat and funny romantic comedy films, and I for one must say that I find most of them entertaining. Here this film is more of a crazy complex drama 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' as it's interesting and the love triangle is complex. You have two friends Vicky(Rebecca Hall)a uptight and straight arrow type who views the world as very cautious, and Cristina(Scarlett Johansson)a free spirited and adventurous type of a girl who wants to discover the world. So one summer they head to Barcelona, Spain for a stay with one of Vicky's family friends Judy(Patricia Clarkson). Soon they spot a charming and handsome looking man named Juan Gonzalo(Javier Bardem) who happens to be a Spanish artist who makes his living doing sculptures. And Juan is a seducer who beds and romances both even though it seemed odd he hit the sheets with Vicky. The lust and adventures are nice and good.Only then the twist comes when enter the ex of Juan as it's been much known in Spain about the situation when his ex the beautiful Maria(Penelope Cruuz)tried to kill him. Once again this tough and sexy woman enters the lives of all three and her romance starts back up with Juan, plus she's back to her own aggressive ways of watching him every minute, and many times she will only speak Spanish, as she bucks to speak English. Slowly but surely the drama and emotional sparks start to fly, call Maria tough or just plain love crazy(a well done performance by Penelope)she is clearly the wild card of this film and she leads it to a very crazy love triangle for both Vicky and Cristina. Overall pretty good direction from Woody as he tries to prove love is complex and it can get tangled up and it still leaves many searching no matter how much fun and enjoyment they have. The love scenes were okay, and the chemistry of the cast made it a joy to watch as all were young and sexy performers. This is one love drama to check out.",7,3,7,2 February 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Classy and Lavish historical film noir.
","As is so common in Hollywood they love to make films about kings and queens and England and it's golden age of rule and power. Well this picture 'Elizabeth the Golden Age' is no different as it's classy and well done the acting is true to art form with Cate Blanchett giving a true to art performance. The movie is of historical significance telling the tale of when Queen Elizabeth's reign is challenged by the ruthless Spain army she then must act to safeguard her people. So just like all old classic literature tales the key elements of civil war and sacrifice dominates. The costumes, sets, and again the acting is super in this film a big thumbs up again for Cate she's tremendous in this fine tale of a crusade for love and control it's proves that Elizabeth is one of the world's most powerful icons.",7,0,1,25 February 2008
The Deer Hunter," Raw and emotional war drama that shows courage and it proves that war can have lasting affects for life.
","1978's 'The Deer Hunter' is an epic film a movie with many chapters as it looks at the ordinary lives of people then it looks at the horror of war, and in the final act chapter it shows how the aftermath affects the lives of all involved forever. The scenes of the Russian roulette are a tease yet some harrowing and very tough moments to watch of the film. All thru this picture the theme of courage and the will to live is present as that overrides the aspect of freedom even more.'The Deer Hunter' follows a group of Pennsylvania steelworkers workers who live ordinary lives they have fun they party, drink beer and whiskey at the bar and they get married and have families. Yet after the blue collar ways when they leave the deer hunting woods of western Pennsylvania and the Alleghenies for the jungles and hell horror zones of Southest Asia for the Vietnam War it's a different story and impact on the lives of all. The performances are standout and the on screen chemistry in among the best in film history most certainly among Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken it's an epic saga of friendship with courage ruling everything. And one can see how the brutal war times have affected the men a great emotional strain that's lasting yet thru courage and determination the human spirit proves to be exceptional. 'The Deer Hunter' is an emotional raw gritty pictures that touches the wounded heart.",9,0,1,29 February 2016
Identity," Life and people intersect and connect thru another's identity a complex and interesting mystery.
","Just recently watched 'Identity' once again and still after all these years it is one mystery that's interesting and complex you leave thinking was the film a nightmare or a real mind game of identity change gone wrong. It's always been true that people intersect with one another and in someway they have a connection, yet this film shows it in the strangest way it's thru the identity of a crazy killer.Anyway enough of the plot theme and point the story is interesting and the film has a mystery feel from the very start. As along the Nevada desert during a rainy night a group of strangers come together as their paths all cross at a rundown motel. Among them are a burned out ex cop and now limo driver(John Cusack)a washed up and past her prime 80's TV star(Rebecca DeMornay)and a crooked cop(Ray Liotta)who has a transported prisoner(Jake Busey)and a sexy and beautiful escort type call girl(Amanda Peet who looked so fine in that sexy black red colored bra!)and rounding out the group is a pair of newlyweds and a family in a crisis who all take shelter at the motel ran by a strange manager(John Hawkes).Thru the night personal demons and secrets are revealed some the same and some deadly, clearly this is one strange and crazy mystery of connection an intersection of identity and mind changing games. Overall 'Identity' is one film that leaves you as a viewer to think the mind is challenged and numb it's one complex interesting mystery that's good from each intersection and connection!",8,2,2,25 May 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Wonderful and heart touching warm film of how a movie came to life!
",'Saving Mr. Banks' a film that's touching and a heart warming true tale of how the classic 'Mary Poppins' novel was brought to the screen and made into a film by Walt Disney is one film any film buff should see. The wonderful Emma Thompson is international author P.L. Travers she had a bad childhood and her one way to escape was writing child novels and the classic 'Mary Poppins' would become the most loved and memorable. In 1961 she's cooked and lead to travel to Los Angeles to work out the rights for a big screen movie with legendary Walt Disney(the super Tom Hanks)and Roy Disney tries his cunning best to land the novel to Disney pictures by placing a stuffed Mickey Mouse in P.L.'s hotel room! Thru it all it's communication and phone tag struggle and lady Travers has flashbacks to her tragic and poor childhood which motivates her even more to get the film made with the Walt Disney company as she will feel like a kid again. Overall nice little feel good warm heart touching film proving memories come true and one can feel like a kid again.,8,1,4,24 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," A film of parody and fun laughs mixed with imagination and humanity.
","'Jojo Rabbit' is one film that as you watch you enjoy the fun and the laughs as you see the world thru the eyes of a young man during war time in Germany. The themes of love, hate, and murder all blend with fantasy and joy.Roman Griffin Davis is Jojo a little boy who wants to train to be in Hitler's army only he already has the evil ruler as his imaginary friend. Things then become turned upside down when his finds and his mother(Scarlett Johansson) reveals that she is keeping a young Jewish girl hidden upstairs! It's like it's a whole new world. Only the film explores tolerance, pain, and love in a new light.Overall good comedy like drama that's fun with change and human feel proving that all people deep down are just alike.",6,4,12,10 November 2019
Live Free or Die Hard," Plenty of action still left in the saga, except now it's more high tech with computers and terrorists technology!
","'Live Free or Die Hard' is a blast from start to finish really if you like car chases, and crashes along with shooting and explosives then this is currently the action film for you. Bruce Willis returns again as detective John McClane all slicked shaved head and looking rugged as ever. This time John meets up with a computer hacker whiz kid, who's been targeted by a computer terrorists group with plans to overtake the federal government and destroy Washington, D.C.. So John heads to the national capital to uncover the schemes and plots of the group, and yes plenty of action occurs just like in the past your typical Die Hard movies are loaded with action from start to finish. In the end John rescues his daughter from the terrorists making him feel good about family again. Overall a good action packed summer movie that is down with our times perfect because of the ever growing concerns of terrorism and computer hacking.",5,1,3,29 June 2007
The Sixth Sense," I see dead people! A film of suspense a tease of mind numbing thought.
","Finally after all these years watched the suspense thriller 'The Sixth Sense' and I know it's a highly respected film ,yet I for one didn't think it was the best as it's a film with twist that threw me off guard and was tough to find direction. Anyway the story takes place in the city of Philadelphia with Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe an award winning and well thought of psychologist who's assigned to a young man by the name of Cole Sear(Haley Joel Osment)who's a timid and confused eight year old boy who's clearly different as he can see things before they happen even seeing dead people. And Cole has a loving and tough single mom(played by Toni Collette)and thru it all this is a journey to learn what haunts the young boy and his life. As the film becomes a work of flashback and future seeing all while trying to throw it's viewer for a loop. I for one left after the viewing as to wonder and ask does the mind really play tricks on people during life, I think that's what 'The Sixth Sense' tries to prove.",6,0,0,10 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars wakes up the force awakens! With a mix of old and new characters!
",The legendary epic saga continues as Star Wars returns with a new entry properly called The Force Awakens. Picking up three decades after Return of the Jedi even after the defeat of the Galactic empire a new threat is on the horizon as the darkness still is present in many forms. A young Sith lord has come to control much of the galaxy as that's the evil and mysterious Kylo Ren(Adam Driver in a strong performance)and the film would reveal a troubled family secret that's attached to Ren. And from the planet of Jakku a young lady named Rey(newcomer Daisy Ridley) a slave type scavenger who comes upon the scene to help the rebels once she exits her planet as this lady is a Jedi in the making. Finn(John Boyega is a storm trooper who takes a turn for the good to help fight evil in the galaxy. And in a real treat the return of old characters is abound with Han Solo and Princess Leia and the fury fuzzball who I say is Bigfoot's brother and that's Chewbacca all make a return! Overall it's a joy and thrill ride of space battles with ships and explosions and battles of good facing evil and the saga has mixed connections of characters new and old from the saga to strongly awaken the force and fly high thru the galaxy!,8,8,27,22 December 2015
Flight," A thrill ride of emotions a redemption and truth telling personal drama!
",'Flight' is one of those films that has you in the passenger seat to watch a journey of emotions and personal drama to unfold. All in the end it reveals truth no matter how painful it is or isn't. The man Denzel Washington is Whip Whitaker a hotshot airline pilot who after a night of binge drinking and drug snorting in which in a hotel room he had sex with a hot sexy colored bra wearing flight attendant named Katerina(Nadine Velazquez)miraculously lands his plane after a malfunction. Still this landing first looked at as heroic was clearly a bad accident it cost lives and plenty of injuries. And you guessed it questions arise as with any drama it seeks the truth still this drama is a character study of redemption and truth seeking. It shows the struggle and courage of one man and that's Whip Whitaker who admits his guilt and struggle as ending with the discovery of truth is what matters most.,8,1,2,15 March 2014
Rear Window," A suspense classic. Done in a unique way by Hitchcock, it proves no matter how immobile when you have your sight it's still the greatest gift of all.
","I for one know just how good of a filmmaker that Alfred Hitchcock is certainly the master of suspense. I for one enjoy his masterpiece 'Psycho', and this 1954 classic 'Rear Window' ranks as a good suspense classic for one it was done in a unique way by Hitchcock the way it was mostly shot in a one room apartment from the lead character who had an across the way view of his own world. The film was shot in such an insular manner. Still over the years many say this is a voyeur film, I disagree true temptation is present from his views of a sexy ballet dancer across the street. Still all in all it proves your sight can come in handy to reveal info after it sees the drama before hand.The plot is good and really suspenseful for the 1950's as legendary James Stewart is L.B. Jeffries a sidelined professional photo journalist who's in his high rise apartment with a broken leg. His life has become all to common with boredom therefore he turns his attention across the view way to the apartments watching the everyday happenings of a ballet dancer, a salesman and his nagging wife along with a piano player. True this may be spying and being to eager yet his sight will turn to be a good friend and lead to an eagerness that will produce a discovery. As when the nagging wife disappears he suspects the salesman, then he enlists the investigation to get started with his opposites attract elegant and sophisticated girlfriend(played by the beautiful Grace Kelly). The film builds with tension and pretty good suspenseful feel for a 50's film leading to a surprise kind of twist ending. Overall pretty good suspense classic from Hitch especially for the unique way he shot most of the scenes form one room of the lead character. It proves too the moral that being immobile isn't important just remember your eyes and sense of sight is the most powerful tool. As when you look out and across you never know what you may find or discover as seeing will lead to suspicion and become a truth finder.",7,0,2,25 May 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Real scary. Wes Craven started a slasher genre phenomenon.
","This 1984 horror-flick is without no question a film that will frighten you. 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is a fantasy of terror, as director Wes Craven shows how a badly burned bogyman can kill and destroy a group of teens thru their dreams. When first seeing this as a small kid the burned face of Freddy would frighten me as when I would lay down at night you would think of his face, and not want to fall asleep! 'Elm Street' has the gore, blood, and evil but unlike some horror films elm street's main theme is psychological. As one should know it's the fears of the mind that are the worst the things you imagine, that hurt you the most in the end. With this group of friends it is the psychology of their nightmares that kills the mind and brings death upon them. Watching this can get into your mind at a young age to be frightened, but as I grew older this film still stayed scary to me, but I learned to look at the realism and not be frightened. In my opinion Wes Craven made this film to show a connection and maybe bring some fright-realism attention to people about the issue of serial murders, and to remind them that we don't live in a good world. Also remember during this films release in 1984, the US was dealing with unsolved cases all over the 50 states. Craven knew an ugly face, a dirty hat and razor gloves would help start the slasher genre, and yes he did put a psychological fear in the public, with this slasher classic.",10,0,0,2 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It changed the way film was made. A phenomenon, a forever and forever impact on our lives and culture!
","What can I say, really so many words and adjectives can be used to describe 'Star Wars' that it's hard to find them all. Without a doubt this 1977 masterpiece from George Lucas which he done it by his own independent and rebel way clearly is one of the greatest films ever made. So many themes and elements are present mainly a tale of good against evil it comes down to light vs. dark. Plenty of mythology is present as Lucas shows by the different cultures of the film and that one must believe in higher powers to accomplish things. 'Star Wars' has it's own civil war battle with the big focus on the rebels and the empire's fight over the galaxy with the Empire's greatest weapon being the mighty Death Star which is ruled by an iron fist with the cruel and powerful Darth Vader. Yet even though Jedi Knights are supposedly long gone, enter Luke Skywalker who's the film wild card who just as a simple farm boy wants and has bigger plans to be a Jedi and defeat the evil empire. Help is provided along the way for Skywalker by the beautiful Princess Leia, and droids C-3PO, and R2-D2(who sends the secret messages and signals) and most importantly the trust and experience of loyalty from Obi- Wan Kenobi. As the furry Chewbacca and cocky pilot Han Solo provide the transportation during this galaxy adventure. I must say also that the special effects and model crafted spaceships used in the film are superb many had never saw anything like it. Great job from George Lucas his direction of the scenes and sets is fabulous. Really what more can I say this movie is so special to me since it was one of the first I saw and being a little kid in the 70's it has a special place in my heart. Seeing this for the first time it was like my real cowboy movie, making me role play in my head and among friends the character of Luke Skywalker thinking he was real I wanted to be him! This epic saga also was the film that started to make me collect action figures, and truly believe in myself and see that the world was about good versus evil. 'Star Wars' created a lasting impact on our times and culture a great tale of morality, faith, good versus evil, and it had all the genres of fantasy, adventure, escape, sci-fiction, and drama mixed together. Really one of my favorite movies of all-time, and always remember what it taught us all 'May the force be with you'.",10,0,1,26 May 2007
Deadpool," Odd and different kind of hero, still a feel good and funny time of watching a movie!
","True it isn't 'Batman' or even 'Superman' still this new hero that I just discovered and watched named 'Deadpool' or AKA Wade Wilson is still an entertaining and fun character to cheer for and like! Actually based on a Marvel comics character the film rolls the dice and brings fun as seeing how one can be redeemed and fight evil while having feel good fun and joy. The backdrop is really simple a former special forces guy named Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds) is the victim of a bad experiment and in the meantime he's transformed into 'Deadpool' and to go along with it he has obtained special powers and a very funny sense of humor while his alter ego has healing powers. Plus to spice things up on the side 'Deadpool' has a very sexy and raw aggressive girlfriend named Vanessa(the attractive Morena Baccarin)who's a sexy lingerie wearing lady who's good in bed to bad she has to become a damsel in distress by being held by bad guys and even having her mouth taped, never fear 'Deadpool' is to the rescue! Overall not the greatest film of a hero still it's fun, odd and different all bringing for a good watching experience.",8,6,18,13 February 2016
Green Book," Great film of connection and uncommon friendship, speaks and brings thought to a troubled age of today.
","'Green Book' is a great and film that really speaks volumes and sends a message of love, caring, and friendship. It proves that thru bonding that prejudice and racism can be challenged and fought against. The film which was well directed by Peter Farrelly('Dumb and Dumber') is based on the true story of black classic concert pianist Dr. Shirley(in a super performance from Mahershala Ali) and his travels thru the deep south for concert work during the turbulent times of the 1960's. And shown is the work of his sidekick and go along travel partner and driver Tony Lip(in a well rounded and blended take from Viggo Mortensen) who as an Italian American bouncer learns life and forms the friendship of a lifetime.The film really captures the times of the 1960's well with it's scenes of the automobile types and the food products, diners, and gas stations. Most of all the way it portrays the times and the people of the south is spot on with racism and prejudice. Shown are the moments Dr. Shirley faces of not being served with whites at fine restaurants and his not being treated well at a clothing story. Plus the police treat him and Tony both different as arrest are made of both on their journey trip adventure of human growth and developing friendship.Overall excellent film that should bring up thought and conversation to want to change people's views and outlook on race, class, and life as we still occupy a troubled age. This film sends a message to love and live life thru connection as on one's journey friendship is possible as no matter the color of skin or how different that of a background love defeats prejudice and racism.",10,3,8,27 November 2018
Annihilation," A hard to figure out film that has you thinking with thoughts of wonder and discovery.
","'Annihilation' is one film that as I watched had me guessing and confused it had me thinking about many things like what direction is it going and what is it trying to say. Clearly it can be classified as a mystery sci-fi type drama with a horror blend feel to it. Plus the all star female cast rocks with good on screen chemistry as Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Jennifer Jason Leigh make a smart and sexy elegant cast.The story centers around Lena(Portman) a biologist who goes on a wild adventure and expedition after her husband strangely vanishes. Along the way this new explored area is like a disaster zone as it's like an environmental plague. Helping Lena on her fight and journey is Dr. Ventress(Jennifer Jason Leigh) Anya(Gina Rodriguez) and Josie(Tessa Thompson). Along the way this battle comes a battle of wills and determination to live and survive as the battle is a combination of science, psychological matters, and emotions that even involves battles against alien like creatures and monsters. Plus the trio of Lena, Ventress, and Josie all become damsels in distress as they are tied up and gagged during this crazy trip. Overall this is one sci-fi film that makes a viewer think and wonder about the afterlife, and other world beings that exist as everything is connected to life, environment, and the mind.",8,7,19,24 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Well Done. One of the best sci-fi films ever. It almost equals the 1977 original in terms of quality and popularity.
","Episode V 'The Empire Strikes Back' released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall 'The Empire Strikes Back' might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original.",10,0,0,27 May 2007
The Ugly Truth," Unbelievable and raunchy and sassy romantic comedy.
","'The Ugly Truth' isn't anything great still it's a comedy that entertains in a crude gross and raunchy kind of way. From watching the scenes of the slow eating of a hot dog and listening to the script clearly you notice that it's a crude and sass comedy. It' not like the classic romance where love was obtained the old fashion way by holding hands and using manners.Katherine Heigl is an uptight and by the book California TV news producer who's programs are starting to fall in ratings. Enter a new sight when one day she sees a public access program that's outspoken as the host(Gerard Butler)tells it like it is about love, life and relationships. So the TV station up and hires this loud and outspoken mouth and what do you know ratings increase! In what was a traditional and uptight controlled news cast is now a sex advice hit! The Butler character starts to give the Heigl character advice on relationships it works at first yet not with some growing pains.Yet thru it all in the end it's a growing experience as each polar opposite will find their true selves and discover unexpected love. Overall this film is nothing great maybe a watch for it's sass and make believe as how many TV stations would really let the Butler character be that foul. And the chemistry between the two leads is nothing great. Really a hit and miss romantic comedy.",5,4,13,24 July 2009
Joy," A tale of one woman's ups and downs in life, yet with invention brings success and happiness!
","Many may watch 'Joy' and say that it feels a little to happy and like a fairy tale, but before I watched I did my research and found out the film is based on the real life story of the 'Miracle Mop' inventor Joy Mangano. And as with anyone who has success with business their climb to the top is filled with setbacks and headaches and this picture showcases those moments in Joy's life also. Directed by David O. Russell he again employs his cast favorites of Lawrence, De Niro, and Cooper still Russell tries his best to make a film about life and the ups and downs of it and how it spans thru the years. Well little miss it girl(Jennifer Lawrence)is Joy Mangano a lady who's a single mother facing tough times as her mom(Virginia Madsen)is a soap opera watching addict and on the side Joy helps take back in her father(Robert De Niro)and also she helps with his auto repair shop. So Joy has to have thoughts about a better life right you guessed it she wants to be an inventor and she has created a hands off 'Miracle Mop' that absorbs and picks up a lot. Slowly but shortly this leads her to stardom when her exposure of the product goes on TV(remember QVC)in front of a big time network head(Bradley Cooper)and with a little luck and help from friends and family the sales of this mop product take off. And Joy becomes a matriarch of family business. Overall this film I didn't find great yet it does give hope showing that no matter how one does struggle in life miracles of success are possible even if it does absorb up in the form of a mop.",7,0,8,26 December 2015
Her," Is this the way that love and sex, and relationships are meant for the future? A nice fantasy want to be romance film.
","'Her' is one of those films that's sweet and care free a fantasy type of a dream film that's set in the future. It involves around the world of technology and communication and the themes of hope and desperation are so present. It's sweet and sour the viewing leaves you with a mixed taste. Set in future Los Angeles, CA director Spike Jonze shows the journey and obsession of one man as Theodore(Joaquin Phoenix)is a lonely man who only now lives for writing stories and poems of love and hope. As after Theo's marriage to Catherine(Rooney Mara)has crumbled the man no longer has the desire for love or sex, it's only when he obtains a new operating system that he falls in love with a sexy computer voice named Samantha(Scarlett Johansson)that changes his life, world, and thoughts! Good female friend Amy(Amy Adams)can only stand and watch as Theodore is taken adrift with his obsession and love with this new computer voice as this is better than having sex with hot sexy women! This film can be classified as somewhat of a sci-fi romance it has it's sweet moments yet it's sour and unrealistic as it's hope and dream of showcasing love and relationship thru computers and technology still maybe years away. This is one film that let's the mind expand with hope, dreams, and high tech love obsession.",6,1,3,12 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," A film that proves no matter how harsh one's life has been thru those experiences can help one master knowledge and win big in the end!
","Director Danny Boyle's film 'Slumdog Millionaire' clearly has hit the jackpot with this picture an uplifting tale for anyone that sees it especially those that are poor and unlucky. Because those viewers can relate to the central character of Jamal so well. And Boyle's direction is life and storybook like as his direction of the film tells most of this troubled young man's life as the whole film is told from a flashback point of view. It's just so touching to see how each life experience of Jamal's past relates to his present as it was able to provide him with unlimited knowledge of the world that he gained from life experiences.Set in the slums of Mumbai, India we as viewers see a journey of harsh living that is experienced by one young man named Jamal Malik(Dev Patel)who along with his older brother from a young age have to deal with many problems from losing their mother, and being abandoned during war time. Along the way the streets are a way of life and survival for them as they drift from location to location only Jamal gradually learns the culture of how to break from the thug world. As without much money Jamal had to survive on his wits to make money this knowledge would benefit him greatly later. Aside from a journey of dealing with the harsh world of cynical thugs and learning the streets Jamal is in part involved up in a love story. When meeting the beautiful Latika(Freida Pinto). Her beauty and love provides some escape for Jamal.It is then when upon Jamal working after leaving his brother and the beauty behind decides to go for the gold so to speak. Jamal becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of 'Who Wants to be A Millionaire' as he feels this is the only way to the path of a good life and a way to escape poverty. Ironically as we see from question to question as the film is done in flashback Jamal reflects on his harsh upbringing and dangerous street days of dealing with thugs as it's many of these experiences that helped him obtain powerful culture knowledge. And oddly enough many of these questions can be answered by his knowledge he picked up from the past.As in life the film proves many simply have a destiny often expected or unexpected as in the end Jamal knows his destiny and the only way that he will establish love with Latika is thru this game show! This may seem like a fairy tale ending to some still it shows destiny is often meant even though it takes many strange paths for some it's those like Jamal that struggle thru a harsh upbringing and that living in slum conditions makes a man stronger especially mentally. And in the end this makes him a master because he's found his destiny. Super work from Danny Boyle proving no matter how tough and harsh life can be for some it can end striking the jackpot.",9,2,5,23 January 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," An out of this world movie, crazy it's in another universe!
",I remember as a kid watching the old Mad Max movies the ones with Mel Gibson and Tina Turner and they were pretty good fun and entertaining with a lot of action and adventure good guys against bad guys. A thrill ride thru a wasteland of a desert universe of different people in a different time. So just recently I watched the new entry 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. And I must says it was okay for a modern day action film a journey of action and adventure.Director George Miller goes to great measures to show this film as a battle of the different classes of rulers a story of rich against poor and a rebel class of female warriors who come to save the day! Tom Hardy is Max the renegade who's captured by the evil and dangerous people of the desert land only to be rescued and joined in battle by a pack a group of female rebels all lead by (Charlize Theron).This film may not be everyone's cup of tea as I didn't find it the greatest still it entertains with action and shows the new class of rulers being females which makes a strong gender statement and I guess if your a fan of the Mad Max series it's one to watch.,6,1,2,25 January 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Courage and being brave becoming a hero in a different way.
","Plenty of movies are made about war and a lot has been written about War War II especially, this picture directed by Mel Gibson called 'Hacksaw Ridge' looks at a different kind of hero from the time period. It's the true story of Desmond Doss(in a strong performance from Andrew Garfield)a medic and self proclaimed pacifist who won a Medal of Honor without ever even using a weapon. And this film is in detail showing the rural life that Desmond lived in Virginia growing up. As he becomes a man he has a pure romance with a young nurse all while maintaining his faith in Sunday, and after going in service to fight in Okinawa, Japan Desmond and others experience hell on the battlefield as this film is very graphic with bullets, blood, bombings, and partial body parts of death all caused by war. Thru it all it takes extra courage for this man who went a different path of being brave to become a hero to be remembered. Really this picture makes one feel the glory of courage with red, white, and blue honor as it's thru love and compassion of others that made Doss a man who will be remembered as the greatest helper never to have packed a weapon.",8,6,11,4 November 2016
The Breakfast Club," An 80's classic that I know by heart. It proves growing up is tough as your judged by your peers.
","1985's 'The Breakfast Club' is a classic I now know by heart having seen many times it's a classic 80's film that never gets old and it captures the times of youth so well as many people remember people they went to high school with that are just like the film's characters. It's a memorable classic from John Hughes as it was nice to see he really showed what teens went thru.Anyway four high school kids spend a Saturday afternoon of detention together at an area Chicago high school for their apparent misdeeds and misunderstandings among peers. It began at 7AM and was to last until 4PM in which they were to write an essay telling who they think they are. Yet none of them had anything to say, at least nothing to say on paper! Interesting and very thought provoking along the way is how they find out facts and info about one another by communication and it turns out to be quite different from each one's perceived stereotype about one or the other.The performances are stellar and memorable you have your typical cast of characters that you come to know in any high school first the prom queen sweetheart Claire(Molly Ringwald), the odd basket case(Ally Sheedy), the brain Brian(Anthony Michael Hall), the jock(Emilio Estevez)and the criminal and most memorable performance was from the delinquent John(Judd Nelson). Each deal with the typical teen problems of peer pressure, acceptance, drugs, sex, and parent issues yet each along the way learn they are a special person as they were meant to be the way they were. A notable performance that was standout was the now late Paul Gleason who was tough and cocky as the school principal who monitored the afternoon stay.Overall great film one of the best and most remembered from the 80's that really showed what growing up in high school was like as each character of the film could be memorable to someone that you probably remembered in school. As the film ends each go their separate ways leaving you as the viewer to form your own take of how each one's life turned out. One thing was learned without writing an essay their was a princess, a jock, a basket case, brain, and criminal and each accepted their stereotype. One thing to remember and one message to take from this film is everyone is different, everyone was meant to be different, and everyone will be different always remember that. As you will cheer for 'The Breakfast Club' time and time again.",9,1,2,8 December 2009
The Social Network," Pretty good film about the creation of a social and cultural addiction yet it shows it's motives arrived from greed and hormones.
","As it's so common today we live in a high tech and fast paced world of technology and social networking and connecting, as it's just a part of life despite if you think it's bad or not. I for one even though I enjoy the internet and info, I'm not to big of a fan of social networks like Facebook I say go to a club or read a book. Anyhow this film written just perfect by Aaron Sorkin and directed in a long drawn method by the brilliant David Fincher is an interesting and feel good look at how Facebook came about.'The Social Network' starting in 2003 at Harvard you have the brain and nerd geek boy Mark Zuckerberg(Jesse Eisenberg)and you guessed it he's lonely and desperate to score with his girl Erica(Rooney Mara)so instead of giving into the social pressures of clubs, and his other peers Mark gives into his anger and starts a fresh new ideal, which has Erica to dump him. So after returning to his dorm room he starts up a website of fresh faces mostly hot looking chicks that he would like to score with. Zuckerberg as he did with his girlfriend Erica starts to type and post nasty items and sexy sayings of which coed he thinks is hotter. It's strangely a thing that's a new tech social hit only to university officials Mark himself seems like a new convicted criminal, as much of the film is flashback of him being on trial in front of university officials.This film mostly serious as it shows an intellect can be interesting and fun it transforms even deeper by showing how Zuckerberg's trip to the Silicon Valley put the final touches on Facebook and his connection with Napster founder Sean Parker(good supporting performance from Justin Timberlake)spices up and makes this picture sweet sugar as it shows the internet business as dirty which includes cocaine parties with hot young sexy chicks that wear sexy colored bras. As it's somewhat of an introduction of a party life for Mark before he becomes a very very rich man.Overall 'The Social Network' is a film that captures our times well as it's telling of a cultural and social creation like Facebook was interesting and educational. It's made even more watchable with it's intellect intrigue and drama proving that this social creation was motivated by greed and hormone driven lust, as this was a way for young men to score and meet hot women! Take it for what you want it's an interesting movie that fits our times well of social connection and greed lust driven technology.",8,0,1,7 October 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," This time Indy's sidekick is family as he takes daddy along for the adventure ride!
","1989's 'Indiana Jones: and the Last Crusade' once again delivers the thrills and excitement just like 'Radiers' and 'The Temple of Doom'. Once again both Spielberg and Lucas have teamed up and Harrison Ford is once again back as Jones only to have the legendary Sean Connery join the cast and it rounds out just fine. This time Indy's Nazi enemies are back only to have kidnapped his professor father Henry Jones Sr.(Sean Connery who was rightfully cast). The theme of this film is centered around searching for the Holy Grail and the trail goes from good old America to Venice to the sands and deserts of the Middle East. Overall pretty good effort it may not match the popularity or style of 'The Lost Ark' or 'The Temple of Doom', yet still the action and adventure combined with the chemistry between two screen legends like Ford and Connery make this a winning try.",7,0,1,24 May 2008
Back to the Future," One of the best sci-fi, adventure, fantasy, films of all-time. Very memorable and unforgettable film that makes you wish time travel were real!
","Since first seeing this classic in 1985 and thru the years from premium cable, TV network, video, DVD, and cable showings 'Back to the Future' has always been an enjoyable film. I've saw it enough many times and whether it be with family or by myself I still enjoy. Clearly the film is well liked for it's theme even though time travel is fantasy, still when blended with adventure and great sci-fi special effects 'Back to the Future' is without a doubt a memorable classic.Directed by film master and genius Steven Spielberg along with special effects wizard Robert Zemeckis they helped make this film one of the most groundbreaking works of all-time. And the story is a catch even though mostly wrapped up in fantasy still the time travel plot sells to all of our hearts making us fall in love with the time travel fantasy. 1980's TV star Michael J. Fox('Family Ties')stars as teen Marty McFly a down on his luck and out of touch high school slacking teenager who's only hope of escape in his present day 1985 is his love of rock music and being buddies with his sidekick wild scientist Dr. Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Yet both feel history is about to change as Doc Brown has created a time machine inside his DeLorean car. Oddly this is groundbreaking yet both become mixed up in a time shattering chain reaction that could keep them stuck in the past with a vaporized future.Strangely they travel back to 1955 at a critical time when Marty's parents had yet to meet. During this time conflict and danger is abound as Marty has to be careful not to expose to much of his identity to his important past, because that is his critical future that he must protect from obstacles. In the past it was fun to see Marty having to force his parents to get together, and plus putting up with old high school bully Biff was entertaining and comical.Lessons learned from this movie is time travel though fun and interesting like seeing the past of your hometown and the fact that you would get to meet your parents before they conceived you would be great, still when facing the conflicts of identity exposure and dealing with past pest(Biff) and unexpected events would be very dangerous and risky. Still 'Back to the Future' is now an immortalized pop culture film classic coming along in a time the mid 80's that showcased and interesting fantasy plot of time travel that filled our entertainment thirst. As it was such a memorable and well liked film for showing that it would be nice and such a dream for anyone to go back and see important things in their past while in the meantime it's such a good feel to be able to shape things in your past that lead to a happy future just like Marty's character did in the film. The adventure and action special effects blend in well with the fantasy theme to make 'Back to the Future' a film that's unforgettable, memorable and one that will certainly stand the test of time!",8,0,0,9 May 2009
Goodfellas," Martin's short and sweet real life mob film that shows crime life pays with excess, but in the end it all breaks!
","Finally watched Martin Scorsese's classic crime drama thriller 1990's 'Goodfellas' and I wasn't surprised I knew what to expect as Martin's films involve most of the time New York, crime, and the real tales of the mob underworld. The film is powerful with it's crime, drama and human emotion as blood and greed is spilled while racking up power and excess only as with most morality stories all of it comes crashing down in the end. The chemistry is fantastic with the all star cast of Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and one of my favorites Joe Pesci. It tells the real life story of small time crook and criminal Henry Hill(Ray Liotta)who climbs up the ranks of the mob underworld after taking part in a big time robbery. And his partner in crime is the big boss James Conway(DeNiro)and thru it all it's a struggle with his trophy wife Karen(Lorraine Bracco)as despite the times of big money and diamonds Henry has a mistress on the side to drive Karen crazy! In a short and sweet note Joe Pesci hams it up as mobster sidekick Tommy Devito. Overall the film may be predictable still it showcases a real life mob drama in fine fashion showing that the life you live pays a bad price for you in the end.",8,0,1,4 May 2014
The Birds," Don't look up or down, birds fly amok! As it's wing flying terror in Hitchcock's visual masterpiece.
","I've been a big fan of Hitch over the years I especially admired his master suspense work in 'Psycho'. And finally after many years I viewed 'The Birds' for the first time and I must say that for it's day the film was a visual and mechanical masterpiece a well done work. As many of the scenes just all of a sudden start you with fear that's unexpected like the flock full of birds on the school playground and the quickness of the birds flying from the sky to peck a victim! Set in San Francisco a wealthy and attractive single lady Melanie Daniels(Tippi Hedren a beautiful screen lady for her day)decides to follow the path of a prospective lover a powerful man attorney Mitch Brenner(Rod Taylor)to his northern California home on the island of Bodega Bay. Upon arriving to his home on the other side of the sea past a little schoolhouse with two love birds and her meeting of his daughter and mother, Melanie plans to stay right up.Slowly and one by one when the residents look up they notice the sky above is different as Melanie can remember from her San Francisco days a flock that looked familiar, it's like these birds flew north for her venture! The scenes of the bird attacks and gatherings are master works for Hitch as his camera use put the audience in terror. The mechanical birds worked to a perfect fit to bring terror and blood to the humans of Bodega Bay! Overall not Hitchcock's best, but effective as it made us think to take cover the next time we saw a bird no matter if it was up high in the sky or down low on the ground!",8,3,5,6 June 2011
Sully," A biography drama of courage and standing up strong and landing people the right way!
","Director Clint Eastwood the legend is still going strong and making film and again he does it with this one as this biography type picture of plane landing captain 'Sully' Sullenberger lands with courage and drama proving that anyone can be a hero and make a decision. Tom Hanks(who's still one fine actor)stars as Chesley Sullenberger an airline captain who becomes a national hero who quarterbacked the landing of a going down plane on the water of the Hudson river which saved all 155 crew members. Clearly this was with great skill and determination that this happened and the film shows these scenes with great drama and skill. However the other half of the picture is about the media attention and questions of what and what not about Sully still despite the drama and doubt this is one hero named Sully that after the landing stood up and became a national hero, and this film clearly and quickly displays that message.",7,0,2,20 September 2016
Valkyrie," An okay political spy historical thriller.
","'Valkyrie' sure isn't the greatest film you will ever see, yet it's not the worst as it has plenty of drama and suspense and the plot is filled with intrigue and intense feelings to make any film fan and history buff interested. Star Tom Cruise who isn't the star he used to be still is very adequate here in this role of Col. Claus Von Stauffenberg who during his command time of WWII decides to plot an assassination attempt of the ruthless and evil German ruler Hitler. As you watch the film if your looking for lots of action you will be disappointed, as it's focus and most scenes deal with behind the scenes workings and overthrowing of a secret plan to disguise a government with the end plans leading them to Hitler. Yet any history buff of those times of WWII and those who know German times along with Hitler history will understand the film well. That said I don't want to give away to much info. Overall this is nothing great yet the plot and planning of the film's story is interesting and keeps enough intrigue and drama to make it a view for most history buffs.",7,3,7,30 December 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Big screen take on the TV series classic is well done. Very funny because it doesn't take things to serious.
","'The Simpsons Movie' is a well done animated film that's very funny and entertaining any viewer will have a good time watching the film and get plenty of laughs. The big screen version stays true to form with that of the TV series method of staying fresh and witty with crude and funny jokes. The writing and producing from James L. Brooks, and Matt Groening is in depth and interesting. Though the characters have remained the same as Homer is still the overweight American screwup, and Bart is just as wild as ever and the rest of the family stays with the same attitude and personality. The plot centers around the environment and the toxic spill of Springfield with the EPA hot on the heels of Homer. The Simpson family decides to relocate to Alaska with plenty of good heart warming and memorable scenes. In the end the family saves the day and returns to Springfield happily ever after. The movie is full of pop culture commentary and wit making the viewer find it funny with plenty of laughs. 'The Simpsons Movie'showcases one great American family you as the viewer feel the emotions and fun loving charm, believe me this film doesn't disappoint.",7,1,4,27 July 2007
The Wizard of Oz," I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore, and there's no place like home, enough said a timeless classic!
","After countless viewings 'The Wizard of Oz' is still a timeless classic and cultural milestone as it still entertains with joy and thrill as a story of a girl trying to find her way home back to Kansas from the magical land of Oz all while making new friends is a wonderful and delightful journey to watch over and over. So much can be said about the film I must for one add that the technicolor and effects and sound made for a great musical for it's time of 1939 as the singing moved the film along just fine with 'Over the Rainbow' being one of the best songs in movie history.The movie came about from a children's novel and short stories writer L. Frank Baum and the directing on screen was done by one Victor Fleming, really the film is a journey of escape and adventure of finding what you want and need with new friends all while facing evil. Dorothy Gale(the young and beautiful Judy Garland) is a Kansas farm girl who's bored and tired at home wanting for a change of pace and eager to see new land has her life swept away in a tornado to the magical land of Oz. Along the way it's a journey of new friends she meets that being the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion with the need and wanting for a home, brain, heart, and courage! The wild card and wicked subplot of the film is facing the mean and nasty Wicked Witch of the West(in a performance and frightening turn from Margaret Hamilton that terrified me as a child and still brings wonder and fear even today). Thru it all this picture tries to give a message that there's no place like home, yet I see it as a journey of seeing new lands, new challenges, and making new friends as leaving your own little nest opens a whole new world of adventure and possibility. Overall a timeless classic and clearly one of the best fantasy and adventure musicals films ever made.",10,4,4,4 February 2019
The Martian," A film of will and the fight to stay alive with smarts, intelligence, determination and skill!
","True I'm a Star Wars fan yet most space movies aren't my cup of tea, but since this was directed by Ridley Scott called 'The Martian' I said this might be one to see. And I must say that overall this one it did entertain with special effects and had the thrill and chills of being lost in space! Matt Damon is astronaut Mark Watney who along with a crew goes on a Mars mission, only when a bad storm hits Mark is assumed dead. And the crew returns to earth only to find out later that Mark is stranded on this hostile planet! What will Mark do? And how will he make it with limited supplies can he also stay alive? This film has you the viewer asking those questions keeping you on the edge proving that when limited a man uses will, smarts, determination, and skill that's learned to stay alive!",8,4,10,10 October 2015
The Fighter," A knockout. Emotionally raw a gripping family psychodrama that's passionate it ends with a soulful triumph.
","I must say 'The Fighter' is clearly a knockout in fact one of the better films I've seen in awhile. And I'm not just saying that because it's a true story of an underdog from the sports world. This is a picture that has enough drama, conflict, sorrow, and courage, with determined passion that it will triumph the eyes of any viewer even if they aren't sports fans. The cinematography is first rate the way the fight scenes were portrayed with realism and fury. And the performances were top notch some of the best I've seen in a long time especially the work of Bale, Adams, and Leo's stand out.If your not a boxing fan then you probably don't know the story of Mickey Ward the Lowell, Mass. working class guy who overcame many personal problems in life especially conflict with his family to become a welterweight champion. Well 'The Fighter' is a near perfect film that captures the story just perfect as director David O. Russell really researched it well as this real life drama of rising stardom that's set near Beantown will leave you with a want to stand up cheering state of mind.Mark Wahlberg is Mickey Ward a local working stiff who struggles as a fighter as he's overshadowed by his older half brother a one time pride prize fighter named Dicky Eklund(brilliant and done in a believable way by Christian Bale). Mickey under the guidance of Dicky as his trainer takes some lumps even though Dick's training style is tough and admirable yet that is sunk under by his manager Mickey's own mother Alice(wicked and well done by Melissa Leo)and this is a lady with control issues she's to ego driven and very stubborn as she's clearly to domineering. And tragically on the side Dicky's main love is that of being an addicted chain smoking crack addict who smokes it up at a local rundown house in the Lowell projects. Finally his crazy and brash hobby leads him to go away for a prison stint. And here Mickey though hurt feels new light and direction in his ring journey with Eklund gone.Now the most interesting and tasty part of the film which I call a wild card character is Charlene Fleming(played wonderful by the sexy and attractive Amy Adams). Charlene a local bar tender who's tough with outspoken lips becomes Mickey's new girlfriend as this little vixen is direct to the point and outspoken one girl that will be right beside Mickey as she will not back down from his tough as nails family as her and mother Alice engage in sassy mouth battles. This makes Charlene all that much more sexy as she's so erotically rugged and beautifully raw(and nice was seeing Amy Adams in a sexy see thru black bra!).Thru all of this emotional drama of family pugilistic life Mickey endures the storm and makes up with mom and Dicky proving that it takes some dysfunction to triumph in the ring. Overall 'The Fighter' is an excellent film not just of sports satisfaction, it's a rousing win for one's spirit and soul it proved that an underdog can win and find satisfaction despite being flawed with inner turmoil of family grief. All in all it scores a big knockout the cast will floor you with their performances. 'The Fighter' is one film that has champion written all over it.",10,3,5,19 December 2010
Up in the Air," A movie that's cold and shows harsh reality. Yet it's a drama that tries making a sharp connection, plus it captures the current times really well.
","Without a doubt Jason Reitman's 'Up in the Air' is one of the best films of 2009, as when watching it you see it really connects and shows the current times really well. As it's themes though cold and harsh are now an everyday reality like layoffs, corporate downsizing, and the firing of people everywhere across this great land of ours. Still aside from the picture's timely themes it's blended with enough vivid characters and a sharp love story that make it an instant classic to never forget.George Clooney(in one of his most standout roles)is Ryan Bingham a lonely corporate downsizing executive who's life is flying in the air around the country to fire people. Ryan goes city to city company to company and gives people the harsh and straight news that they have no longer been needed and Bingham is good at it too he doesn't seem to miss any sleep. Ryan also has an obsession with frequent flying miles it's his goal to break the record.Only Ryan's boss Craig(Jason Bateman)wants to tame it down some and keep Ryan out of the air and keep him grounded and change the game up some. Those new ways happen to be more high tech firing by conference calls of the internet and sugar coated meetings. And much of this rest on the newly hired young gun the bright and sassy new partner of Ryan's that is Natalie Keener(Anna Kendrick who's character shows such a fragile state behind her cruelness). Along the way as they journey together along the cities and conference rooms a lot is learned as Natalie sees she just isn't made out for this harsh world as she's taught lessons by the old pro Bingham which will open up doors for her in a new direction.The biggest dilemma for Ryan is he must choose between his goal of flying miles or a connection to his heart with another frequent traveler Alex. Ryan meets an attractive and elegantly sexy lady named Alex(Vera Farmiga in a nice sexy role)one night at a classy hotel bar for traveling executives they both hit it off as the chemistry is just right. It leads to a one night stand romp in a hotel room, as a connection is made right then as Ryan feels lust has captured his heart. Along the way on more travel both Ryan and Alex have more romantic encounters that Ryan feels is becoming more and more unexpected love which has him at risk of settling down. Only Bingham will find out a big surprise with Alex as she has hidden secrets and looked only at him as escape.Overall great film that along the way tried to change the central character of Ryan Bingham, yet in the end he rightfully stayed put as he belongs up in the air to make a living and that's his life. Most important it was good he was at least able to make some romantic connection along his journey even though if it wasn't meant and his influence in some way was used to change the life and attitude of the movies wild card Natalie(Anna Kendrick)showing her she was meant for a more sensitive job task not one like his of life flying and firing people. Really 'Up in the Air' is a movie that will be looked upon for many years to come as it captures the mood and economic recession times of downsizing just perfect as when later and newer generations look back to see how a majority of people were living in 2009 they will look back to this film as it captures the harsh reality of the current life. 'Up in the Air' is now a remembered instant classic.",10,2,7,26 December 2009
Atonement," An epic tale of lust, love, war, and guilt with remorse.
","'Atonement' is clearly a fine work of art on screen that's greatly influenced by literature. It has all the classic elements of literature and classic prose from lust, love, war, and in the end the central character writer Briony Tallis feeling guilt and remorse for a false accusation. The film will clearly bring out emotions especially if your genre of choice is romance and passionate love, yet you will have wished for more proved truth and justice to have happened earlier in the film even though it's revealed in the end.Set in the mid 1930's in England the film has a classy and elegant setting like all British films you feel the grace of the family. You quickly become swept up by the beginning and desire for dreams as little young darling Briony Tallis(Saoirse Ronan)is caught up in a world of plays, imagination and stories she wants to happen ranging from joy to love. Her older sister is looked upon from her as an inspiration Cecilia Tallis(Keira Knightley)a young lady who's eager for love and romance escape by desire and pleasure. Only young Briony sees an unpleasant and uneasy sight from Cecilia's new love interest as dashing Robbie Turner's ambition for lust will soon send him on an unpleasant and long journey that will make him struggle for love and happiness.As 'Atonement' spans thru time into war of the gruesome blood and death that Robbie sees while fighting as a solider, Briony's story unfolds as the time changes with her sister growing up and moving on to nurse school and Briony herself with take the same job path. All along the flashbacks of love and joy are presented so well only like a classic work of literature it reveals the painful truth of justice and honesty in the end as we see an old and aging Briony who has it all wrapped up in her last and greatest and most soul truth searching novel piece. You the viewer should finally feel the truth and justice.Overall 'Atonement' is a good film I will not call it great because the war and romance genre isn't my favorite, yet it still has enough classic literary elements like lust, love, and the search for truthful justice to make it interesting and enjoyable to watch.",7,5,8,21 January 2008
