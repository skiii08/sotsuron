The Avengers," The Avengers blew my mind.
","The Avengers is the best movie I have ever seen my whole life. Without Stan Lee and Jack Kirby the Avengers would not have even been a thought. without the comic books Joss Whedon would have never have had an idea of where to start.The Avengers starts out kind of slow but you get to know the characters better that way. A lot of the movie had me on the edge of my seat with my Joker smile. the Hulk transformations to me were like opening tons of gifts on Christmas and jumping up and down for joy. seeing the Hulk smile made me laugh, he has nice teeth. the fights were all so incredible they made me so happy all three times i saw the movie. the Avengers was so well written and the cast was perfect to me. seeing Thanos made me gasp in excitement. Thanos is one of those guys you look at and you say to yourself I know that dude is evil. He is a major major bad guy in the Marvel universe.If you have not seen the Avengers yet WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? I hope you enjoy my review,I did not want to give a lot away.",10,3,7,6 September 2012
