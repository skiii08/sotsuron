Skyfall," And so the reboot finally turns the franchise around
","Please be aware that this review contains spoilers.After watching Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace (which i thought was great movies, ..just not Bond movies) i thought that the franchise was dead. James Bond has finally seen its end. You know the criticisms of those movies, so i won't elaborate ('Do i look like i give a damn' - for example). I've read about this upcoming Bond film for a long time, and the first thing that struck me with this movie was, they brought back Q! What a wonderful decision to make (him being absent in the previous two movies was really a letdown). I really thought - perhaps the producers finally intent to get THE James Bond back to where he really should be. So i watched this movie.I was so impressed by the producers decision to bring back everything that defined Bond in the past, back. Moneypenny, the old office, male M (not that Dench was bad), Bond's cold and calm attitude. This is what the franchise is about, it's not about overused action scenes, boring love dramas, Bond avenging his lover etc. This movie blended the good parts of the previous movies with true Bond elements and made it a masterpiece. While i do understand that some plot twists and overacting in fact DO exist in this movie, it may not be the greatest movie ever made, but for what i care, it doesn't matter - Bond has made it back, and this is what a reboot is all about: Bringing a franchise into the modern world. They're not trying to recreate Goldfinger, they're trying to make a good action movie out of a bond movie while still retaining the things that defined the character. Alright, there's things that could've been done better, i'm not saying anything else, but i'm not watching Bond movies because they're cinematicly the best, i'm watching them for one reason, and one reason only - because they're Bond movies.Now i can finally look forward to the next bond movie, knowing that the franchise is back on tracks. Whatever rating it gets on IMDb in the end, this movie will always be known as the 'Dr. No' of the reboot. These three movies tell the tale of how James became Bond, now we want to see how Bond fares in the modern world, now that he's finally back as we know him.Two things i may suggest in the next movie, that will really Isis the cake - Gun Barrel sequence in the beginning of the movie (YES it's been pointed out millions of times), and the sparingly using of 'shaken, not stirred'.",9,2,15,8 November 2012
