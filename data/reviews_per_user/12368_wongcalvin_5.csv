La La Land," One of The Best MUSICAL MOVIE!
","La La Land is one of those movies where you be watching the first time and just as you step out of the theater complex, you instantly be reminded of the tune and rhythm of every music and songs in the movie. It would sends you instantly be looking for the songs and downloading in your laptop wanting to hear and hear again that would even revisits back every now and then. La La Land is a musical/romantic/comedy movie where we be following the journey of the two main character, Mia by Emma Stone and Sebastian by Ryan Gosling both academy nominee and winner, actor and actress that had an outstanding performance into their roles. Both actor and actress were lovable, cute, and gorgeous that is perfect for each other but not all story has a happy fairy tale ending. It is a journey through love and career with a wonderful jazz musical piece that would take your breath away.The musical in this movie is dreamy, magical, with a good level of detail by the youngest Oscar best director winner, Damien Chazelle into using old camera, Panavision XL2 that captures the images with a rich and most colourful visuals which what made this movie magical, due to the fact that old cameras captures visuals more highly saturated compared to the modern cameras which capture images at its most realistic that makes films now boring and felt flat. Justin Hurwitz that made the most fascinating score and songs for this movie which made this movie stands out among other movies.For me this movie, is possibly one of the best movies I've watched in my lifetime that made me loved Jazz even I'm not really into Jazz music. It is one of those rare gems that you need to find among thousands and thousands of films released every year and finding this movie had been really an eye-opening for me. Overall it's a sad and loving movie with wonderful musical and excellent cinematography that takes on the journey of love with jazz, and I urged everyone to watch it once in their lifetime to experience this cinematic experience.",10,4,5,21 September 2019
The King," Running away from history but still great movie !
","This movie had a great cast, especially by casting Timotheen Chalamet was the perfect role for becoming Henry V, on the other aspect like score, cinematography, editing were all great but not the best. One great part of this story is the dialogue which is fairly well written among the characters.There's one scene on the medieval battle kinda resembles The Battle of the Bastards from Game of Thrones, which is filled with horror, blood, killing and well claustrophobic but I kinda feels HBO's GOT done that scene better due to the budget constraints but it's fine.Overall it's a great movie, great battle , great dialogue and great performance from Timothee Chalamet !!",8,4,6,8 November 2019
Joker," Masterpiece *Movie Of the Year* Best Actor - Joaquin Phoenix*
","Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!",10,157,328,2 October 2019
Midway," Great War Movie with Accurate Facts
","One good thing about this movie is that it has a great cast which each important character has its own fair share of time and it sticks to the facts pretty well. From the start to finish, there isn't much dull moments and there is always something heroic actions and building up characters which is important for the later scenes.There is a balance scenes and moments between Americans and the Japanese which is quite a good thing as isn't biased on any side. The movie kinda have many great historic moments alongside with the CGI scenes not the best as practical effect from Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, but it's still pretty impressive on some of the scenes.However the score of the movie does lack a little, and it just needs a little more punch and more dramatic score to match up with those battle moments, just a bit lack of tense in the music design.Overall not bad for this movie. Great time if you wanna learn more about this great historical moments of WW2. Worth a shot !",8,7,11,15 November 2019
