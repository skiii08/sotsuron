Changeling," uninspired cliché
","This movie is utterly craptastic in every aspect. From the very beginning to the very end it's a never ending plea for Oscar nominations, although not an unusual approach for a movie, this time Clint Eastwood took it too far. It's too obvious that the people behind and in front of the camera thinks too much about the 'oscar' scenes than the outcome of the movie as a whole.Angelina Jolie does an average appearance in this role, although everyone knows that the role would be perfect for Nicole Kidman. Angelina may be pretty, but her 'fake' look does not fit the 1930's scenario and her acting is not good enough.Several times during the movie a single line is repeated over and over to the point where it becomes annoying, and it seems to me that the writers just simply where out of good ideas.Sorry Clint, you fail. The movie might be based more or less on a true story, this is a farse of uninspired cliché.I know there will be loads of people disagreeing with me on this one, because if you got names like Clint Eastwood and Angelina Jolie on the cover you can sell people crap and make them eat it.Watch the movie twice and I'm sure you see my points.Tommy",1,35,70,31 January 2009
