The Avengers," Banner/Hulk and Thor characters
","Let me reiterate, 10 line minimum impractical and extremely annoying. Minimum and maximum amt. of words, that is truly a lame brain policy. Topic of Thor, How much common sense did Stan Lee put into creating this particular comic book hero? Norse gods are nothing more than superstitious myths/theology. Far more rational to believe these ancient stories are based off how man at the time perceived the science of older races with far more advanced technology. Science will eventually disprove the existence of gods and a high percentage of ancient mysteries that some attribute to aliens, or time travelers. Here is a theory it is believed in the scientific community that life evolved and perished repeatedly over the past 4 billion yrs., what if not all those who evolved to create their own technology died out, they would be so advanced they would easily be able to hide among society today. Witless faith people as in Jehova, or anyone else who quote their particular religious text chapter and verse wake up, those disasters conveyed in religious texts are bunk, again all can rationally be explained through science in this case natural disasters. Maybe that is why we are not forced to actually make sacrifices to these alleged gods, because they sympathize with us because they can still recall when they were much like us, the truly god-like do not expect to be worshiped. As for the character of Loki if Norse myths/theology is based on advanced beings from space or remnants of past advanced earth civilizations, I like to think of the Star Trek animated episode of the Enterprise traveling to the center of the galaxy and the crew finding themselves in a dimension where things can be created merely by one's thoughts. In preceding mentioned STTAS, the character Loki, who was also Lucifer, or should I say the Patron Saint Of Enlightenment was actually much more like Thor seeing potential in the inhabitants of our planet to grow and become compassionately wise. Fact be told the Tora most likely describes Satan as wicked because he did not see the logic in keeping mortals ignorant whether it means complete peace or not. Alright that is enough about Viking gods and myths/theology. When did David, middle name or not David at least is a respectable sounding name, Bruce sounds like a name that should be applied to the mentally deficient such as your Christian Coalition, inbred, hillbilly, redneck type, much like the name Douglas where you feel tempted to say Dougie, or Doogie, might as well say Doobie, because you would expect someone with such a stupid sounding name to have zero brain wave activity such as person high on THC. Digress again which 1 is compelled to do from the start (* 10 line minimum). I have never been much of a reader of comic books, more important things to save what little money I had on, but shame on the screen writers of this movie, from what I know about the fictitious character of the Hulk, all texts cast Dr. David Bruce Banner/Hulk as a Dr. of medicine, more precisely biochemist/geneticist and possibly microbiologist in this movie he was no more than a physicist which means he would have no chance of curing his genetic mutation since 1 would not only need to have some knowledge in physics, but more so in biochemistry and genetics. Confused as to the part of the part where Nick Fury is explaining to Steve Rogers about the Hulk being created out scientific research related to the technique that create him, come on now, scientific knowledge of the first half of the 20th century. If you exposed anyone to gamma radiation with what little knowledge was known about effects of any given amount throughout much of the 20th century they would have died from radiation poisoning. Considering there has been so much talk about the dangers of radio waves, electromagnetism judged from people who have been exposed to RADAR type devices, or high levels of electromagnetism such as high voltage power lines, transformers without sufficient research you will die. Banner's survival was because his nucleotides were rearranged in a fashion that prevented the radiation levels from killing him. What is the source of this version of Banner/Hulk constant anger? Being that this is an entirely different Dr. Banner history from previous story lines the Dr. David Banner of the television series suffered from far more heartache than this 1. Wait do not tell me, Loki will be spewing hatred for his adoptive Asgard brother Thor and Asgard alike along with his condescending loathing of us worthless mortal humans, wreaking havoc and being responsible for more death and destruction, damn either kill the character off or scatter his subatomic particles across the vastness of space, he is an imminent threat to mortals just as Muslims are an imminent threat to those who do not adhere to the same religious doctrine as them. Do I detest the Muslim faith, damn straight I do, because no other religion is followed by people as ignorant and/or state of denial of it's origins as them. My 2 favorite scenes is where Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America turns to the Hulk to provide tactical strategy and says Hulk (carefully choosing words) smash, in response the Hulk smiles, and later in the movie where the Hulk is confronting Loki again in an arrogant soliloquy and again proclaims he is a god, indirectly insinuating mortals exist solely for his amusement, and the Hulk grabs him smashing body against the floor and/or walls in response and says puny god.",8,1,4,25 June 2013
The Finest Hours," 'Not sure I needed to mention that this is a Spoiler.'
","Portrayal of Gust Force wind conditions far from consistent, sometimes the snow and drifting so fierce you could not see very far while other times you could see for quite some distance.Sometimes the boat was severely rocking, while at other times boat was not rocking at all.I have only seen 1 other movie depicting procedure and execution of Coast Guard Rescue missions on the high seas and that was the Guardian.Judging from portrayal of Coast Guard mission protocol was executed in movie The Guardian , from what I have been told from an uncle by marriage who is a retired Coastie, my sister's 1st husband, and 2nd husband both of which are former Coasties I whole heartedly affirm that the events were depicted fairly accurately.My rating 1st and foremost was determined by the portrayal of courage, heroism, and perseverance by both the surviving crew of the Pendleton and the Coast Guard Rescue team.",6,0,3,28 May 2016
Star Trek," Major bastardization of television series, did not hold true to plot.
","Was it Star Trek or the Star Wars trilogy, from what I hear far more like the latter. I have seen repeats of classic Trek and read many of of the novels based off the original television series, first class example of bastardization of a television series icon. Sadly our society has declined where people with poor taste idolize obvious garbage. Who cares how unrealistic (stupid) a plot is as long as you have great special effects. Robert April was the first captain of the Constitution class Enterprise. War with the Romulans took place about 10 yrs. after Zefram Cochrane's historic flight. We fought them in vessels referred to as darts. We and the Romulans did not have ship to ship audio or visual communications, no phasers, shields, transporters (*Star Trek episode Balance of Terror, which aired Dec. 15, 1966.). The bastardized remake made it appear the entire bridge crew attended Star Fleet Academy at the same time, which clearly is not possible Kirk is at least 10 years older than Sulu, and Uhura and 12 years older than Chekov. It is mentioned repeatedly in Classic Trek that the only 1 of the crew Kirk knew from his academy days was McCoy. Although they died in the episode Where No Man Has Gone Before, aired September 22, 1966 James Tiberius Kirk before being promoted to rank of captain had served with and was a friend with Lt. Cdr. Gary Mitchell and Lt. Lee Kelso.",1,7,9,2 June 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," I read the official Star Trek Into Darkness Spoiler FAQ
","You had the person providing details to basically every primary scene of the move, every twist and turn in the plot. The movie was nothing more than poppy cock and balder dash, I would say hilarious if it were not for the fact completel unbelievable, pure fantasy in no way true Sci-Fi.. Khan cooperating with a Star Fleet Admiral, freezing lava with a Cold Fusion bomb, ha!, cold fusion bombs do not create cold. Super humans in torpedoes, yet again retarded, super star ship, Enterprise getting the crap beat out of it, after Scotty plugged up all the toilets of Death Star ship , can not recall what he did but creating massive pressure to build until it exploded. The idiot who in his review said he loved this movie must love the way wet cow manure sticks to anything you throw it at, no taste for cinema art whatsoever. Forgot to mention I also loved the part about Bones injecting a dead Tribble with Khan's blood and it coming back to life, and used the same technique to bring Kirk back to life. None of this movie was based on science in any essence of the word, merely bunk, junk, garbage, to quote Johnny 5: 'Shiat, where you see shiat', I'll tell you where, watching J.J. Abrams mangled, twisted, bastardized versions of Star Trek.",1,57,92,24 May 2013
Alien," In my opinion the scariest Science Fiction movie ever.
","Yes indeed, 'In Space No One Can Hear You Scream.' Unlike Terminator where Judgement Day convinced the audience a sequel was not possible Alien left no doubt there could and would be a sequel. Granted it was a black movie almost every character was killed off, but good sci-fi action flick. I have always appreciated Sigorney Weaver's acting skills. Very scary for a sci-fi flick, clearly the most terrifying science fiction movie to date. Had me sitting on the edge of my seat, never knew what was going to happen next. Whats not to like eggs being implanted down throat of hosts growing and exploding from chest. How annoying, the minimum word limit, I have nothing more to say about the movie it was very good.",10,5,8,2 June 2012
Armageddon," Many discrepancies in movie.
","That aside it was probably still 1 of the better Sci-Fi flicks in the last 40 years. As for problems to the plot lines: Glass cockpit windshields, that is what caused the complete destruction of Independence, they should have welded metal over the windshields and put in surveillance (observation) cameras. Chasing asteroids or comets is not a smart idea ever, has anyone ever heard of tail debris. As for when they landed at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral being that they had just been walking around on an asteroid they most likely would have been quarantined not have been running around shaking hands and slapping backs in congratulation of a job well done. The inaccuracies are too many to recall, but then again little compared to those written by screen writers and the technical and scientific advisers for Sy-Fy channel movies, what do you expect from NBC/Universal.",10,1,2,2 June 2012
Face_Off," I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this
","I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this movie went out and found any and all who in their poor taste in entertainment bought this video, or DVD. The mere notion that you can of simply removing someone's facing and surgically transplanting it onto someone else's skull to completely change their appearance is preposterous. I rented the video years ago from Blockbuster, probably not long after it hit the video store shelves. I can easily think of 5 Cage movies far better: 8 Millimeter, Lord Of War, Con Air, Match Stick Men, Thunder Birds, and Ghost Rider. I guess some people adore some actors so much no matter how poorly written the script is they will still praise the movie.",1,2,5,29 April 2013
The Fly," Are you people insane?
","You gave the remake a 7.5 but the sequel only a 4.7, alright I will admit Geena Davis is/was hotter than Daphne Zuniga and although Goldblum being cast in these genius know it all roles: The Fly, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, and that detective in L&O CI for as much as it is worth still behaves more manly in these roles than Stoltz, was it not Stoltz who was unconscious the entire length of Anaconda, perfect example of movies that sucked the shape of a guy outlined as expanded and contracted it's muscles to get the guy in, you really cannot say down, not like a biped. I despise genius character role unless the genius has phobias and health problems that make them seem more normal, for that precise reason if there is nothing else better to watch and I catch a repeat of STTNG if it focuses around the character Whussly Crusher played by Wimp Wheaton I will not watch it, if I remember correctly him leaving the show was because fans complained he was ruining the show always coming up with solutions to problems faster than anyone else including Data, what a bunch of malarkey.",5,4,15,20 July 2013
Looper," 'No spoilers will be shown, in your wildest.'
","Very disappointing ending, just because Joe from the present shot and killed himself preventing future Joe from killing Sarah does not guarantee that Seth would not grow up to be the Rainmaker, the kid had a very short fuse. Very disappointing ending, just because Joe from the present shot and killed himself preventing future Joe from killing Sarah does not guarantee that Seth would not grow up to be the Rainmaker, the kid had a very short fuse. My review does not contain enough lines, yet I repeated all that needs to be said about the movie. Very disappointing ending, just because Joe from the present shot and killed himself preventing future Joe from killing Sarah does not guarantee that Seth would not grow up to be the Rainmaker, the kid had a very short fuse.",3,1,3,11 May 2015
