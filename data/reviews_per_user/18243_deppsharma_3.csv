Child 44," could be more intriguing
","this tom hardy , gary oldman crime drama has everything what a perfect of this segment should have. the story is nice and penetrating ,it gives you awe when the central character of the movie grills by his authorities and the state tools are using against him to put him down.I think so ,what it lacks is; a kind of pace ,the series of developments where scene arcs and their objectives point you at the super-objective of the plot.crime dramas convince you that here is something hell a lot of going on and the character has to solve it really.what makes the movie dragging is our central character is messing up the different things altogether and that's not too well.sometimes crime dramas has to follow linear story telling to keep the audience at edge and here the movie drowns.the director also couldn't impress you with the serial killer's criminal activities and details.",6,1,5,24 July 2015
Sicario," a subtle take on Mexico drug cartel
","the movie starts with a fbi American explosive style-bang raid on a doubted drug ring near US Mexico border, unearths dead bodies from the walls of the structure.A casualty during the raid takes the war against drug on an accelerating mode. which leads emily blunt to be roped on joint operations near the Mexican border by an American agency comprising josh brolin and benicio del toro. wihtout letting blunt know the details of the missions. whether it is blunt , brolin or benicio all of them played their characters with deep conviction and well researched . benicio del toro shines all of them , he is a deep seated cop who had flanked almost every drug cartel in his undercover days. blunt has been shown a loner fbi agent. cinematography is very different from other films of the league. roger deakins is just superb. direction takes you on a different level with the on going war between administration and drug cartel. the movie's pace is subtle and very frame leaves you with something new and fresh. it also shows the barbaric measures taken by authorities to deal off the situations.It strikes an equilibrium between the drug cartel and the administration.",9,0,3,10 October 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," trailer was much better....
","Matthew Vaughn last movie X-men was a really I could like watch it anytime and can enjoy the same thrill through its superb screenplay.I must quote here this film is more stylish than bond films ,particularly the accent of Colin firth was really i would drool over.this movie is set in current scenario of which also attributes to the past era of espionage of cold war.I liked the action and locations but the movie has a setback ,it really lets you down doesn't have much to give for old school audience.but I really think so production would go for a sequel.It's cinematography is awesome and some camera tricks are really laudable. Samuel Jackson played an antagonist but with caricature . and his claim for the notoriety wasn't much established .",7,0,6,18 March 2015
