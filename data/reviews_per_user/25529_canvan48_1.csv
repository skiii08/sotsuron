Child 44," Wasted Opportunities
","I had to struggle to watch this production. Good actors, decent cinematography, not a good script and terrible, yes terrible 'accents' that were, to me, totally distracting. I tried, I tried and I tried to watch this production. I was grasping for straws. It's simply not there. I am a huge fan of Oldman and Hardy but this film is eminently forgettable. Frankly, this production is a washout. Citizen X is far better and more memorable than this sorry story. I think the movie is cloaked in dark visuals that are actually hard to see and are pervasive throughout the effort. If one cannot see or hear, then the film is a waste of work. I am sure I will get very low ratings, if any, for my very negative opinion of this production. This is the worst movie I've seen in many years and this is the lowest opinion I have given of a star laden film.",1,16,30,15 September 2015
