The Blair Witch Project," Worst 'scary' movie ever.
",I went to the Blair Witch Project expecting this great movie.  What I got was scenes of sticks and piles of rocks.  I don't particularly find anything scary about that or anything else that took place in the 'movie'. I could make a better scary movie.  It was too hyped up.  Maybe my expectations were too high but I just wanted to be scared and that's not to hard to do.  So two thumbs down and a rating of 1 for 'The Blair Witch Project'.  The results of the project?  Wasn't very good.,1,1,3,4 September 1999
