Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than the critics say, but not insanely great.
","Yes, the special effects are awesome.  Yes, there should have been more character development.  This is still a very good movie.  Loaded with hints for episodes 2 & 3 as well as tie-ins from episodes 4,5 & 6, there is plenty here to make me want to see this flick several more times.  It is also unfortunate that arguably the most interesting & engaging character (Jar Jar Binks) is a computerized creation.  Overall, though, the force is strong (but widely dispersed) in The Phantom Menace.",7,0,0,21 May 1999
The Iron Giant," A real treat.Well done, a good message and very entertaining
","A true family movie.  My 4 & 5 year old grand daughters loved it, and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  The animated characters are generally well developed.  The animation quality is superb and the story is engaging.  It is not overly complex, nor is to too 'preachy' in delivering its message of non-violence.  I feel it is a rare movie in that it works well on many levels.  If possible, see it in a theater that can properly reproduce the fine audio track which is loaded with low frequency energy.",8,0,0,16 August 1999
