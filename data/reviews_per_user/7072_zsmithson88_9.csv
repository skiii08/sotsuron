The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Much More Than a High School Drama
","'We choose the love we think we deserve,' and until you find that one, sitting there suspended in time, it's a ton of trial and error. A wallflower is said to be a most interesting type of individual, but externally they are shy, and people take no notice of the brilliance within. For a time, this used to be me - Charlie. 'Sing me to sleep; I don't want to wake up on my own anymore... Deep in the cell of my heart, I would feel so glad to go.'Life can be cruel and ruled by time. It seems that when we are young time drags along, however when we are old it hastens and never slows. The years we have in front of us, no matter the age, are all that we have. We can't choose where we come from but we can choose where we are going. 'And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17. I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. We'll all become somebody's mom or dad.'Stephen Chbosky translated the novel onto celluloid in such a dramatic and artistic way that it was as humble as it was boastful in its execution. Feeling the progression of each character's developmental growth, as an intended audience viewer, is where this film establishes response with the audience; thus the foundation for the overall attraction and gravitational pull, and flux of emotions becomes paramount.There are specific moments in life that we desperately yearn to eclipse us in such a profound way that once they've occurred it will be better than what our minds dreamt up. Once that moment happens, we will no longer be writing alone but participating with those that we love, and that love us right back. 'I can see it... The moment when you're not a sad story...You're alive.'",9,0,0,6 January 2020
Skyfall," 007 Will Make the Sky Fall
","'Let the sky fall. When it crumbles, we will stand tall, and face it all together.'Sam Mendes orchestrates a piece of celluloid perfection with the third Daniel Craig installment. From the moment Bond's silhouette sinks into crystal waters and Adele's voice enters the tympanic membrane, valid Bond fans will envisage what waits in the coming two hours.The set pieces throughout each act propel the film to an epic conclusion that will transcend Bond fanatics and moviegoers alike. Javier Bardem is arguably the most twisted, dastardly, unhinged and cunning amalgamation Bond has ever faced in his fifty years, and 'my-oh-my' is it a pleasure to behold...From a cinematography aspect, the film is superlative, and quite possibly the best the series has ever seen - no buffoonery.In closing, allow yourself to become captivated with the 23rd installment of the James Bond franchise, as this will not disappoint; nor deny the craving for Bond magic.Skyfall will cement itself alongside such EON classics as From Russia With Love, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Man with the Golden Gun, and Goldeneye.",9,2,5,6 January 2020
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Bloody Demonic Fleet Street
","'Sweeney Todd' is a revenge story draped around sorrow many times over. Once you face the fact that Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, and the entire cast, minus Timothy Spall, have magnanimous voices, which isn't hard - it's spellbinding.Most film directors open stage productions by adding meaningless busyness to make them more cinematic. Burton constricts the space and concentrates on the melodrama at hand that lies within the soul of the story. The minor-key chamber music reminds me much of a Catholic Chapel organ tune that carries throughout the film. This element adds to the growing suspense and climax of the film. Burton uses gouts of bright ruby blood that geyser out against the monochromatic backdrops.This is definitely not a film for weak of stomach or young of age. The MPAA rated well as the movie contains explicit throat slashing scenes that would indeed make Jack the Ripper envious. Now Depp has another aurora about him in light of the fact he can sing very well. Burton shoots him close-up in a loving way; and mad Johnny has the right intensity; the right morbidity about his characters that causes the other characters to fall in line.Ms Lovett, for example, has the frugal idea of grinding up Sweeney's victims for her minced meat pies. Bonham Carter brings both a ghoulish and erotic tone to the film. If there were a Playghoul magazine, you'd want Burton atop the centerfolds, after all, he has spawned 'The Nightmare Before Christmas,' 'Batman,' and many others.Like Ms Lovett's minced meat pies, Sweeney isn't for every viewer's appetite. Sondheim, the original creator and arguably the greatest theatrical composer and lyricist could've never been more proud of the big-screen adaption being so deliciously served! The film is simply one you will love or hate. Hit or miss with everyone I've come into contact with.",9,0,0,6 January 2020
Life of Pi," A Dreamy, Incredible Life
","'Mr. Patel's is an astounding story of courage and endurance unparalleled in the history of shipwrecks. Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea... and none in the company... of an adult Bengal tiger.'Simplistic, yet for all its intertwined complexities, this marvelous piece of celluloid majesty will remain emblazoned in the souls of all those that were deeply pierced by the awe-inspiring creativity and passion.",9,0,0,6 January 2020
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Grand Stay
","The plot can only be described as multifaceted, yet incomparable to any other existing work.ImageThe characters can only be summarized as sublime, sensational, and stellar; with the vigorous and charismatic charm that dispenses an irrevocable and scintillating aura over the timeless portrayals.The cinematography can only be as expected from the eclectic and distinct ingenuity of Mr. Wes Anderson; though this endeavor boasts the most memorable application yet.ImageThe overall unanimity vociferates the magnificence that the many units of language are eloquently strung together-thus-forging a melodic and classic masterpiece.",10,0,0,6 January 2020
Django Unchained," Hop Aboard the Django Train!
","Hopping aboard the Quentin Tarantino train often carries a certain burden and expectation. You see, the burden often appears when dealing with his hysterical, complex and down-right ridiculous and suggestive vernacular that some people become instantly offended by. The expectation enters and creates the coupling with the overall screen time of his endeavors, which causes some to display the supreme disrespect, by walking out of the theater. Both cinematic styles obviously attract a certain type of moviegoer, however over the years Tarantino has been perfecting his craft; thus causing more fans to gravitate to his pictures.In the case of his past films, he's succeeded quite often, while sometimes the length can pummel the picture directly into the subterranean abyss; amidst the analytical dialogue and witty exchanges. When the combined elements of his pictures come together in harmony, his directorial efforts are hard to match, let alone exceed. The casting choices boost his films with a dynamic nature that is a rarity at best these days. We, as audience members, have played host to his magnificence, with such originals as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Inglourious Basterds, and the characters that propel these film to greatness, such as Lt. Aldo Raine, Colonel Hans, The Bride, Butch Coolidge, Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield.As the 2012 year draws to a close, Tarantino and The Weinstein Company have brought us a dazzling gem of a film that reinvents the dried-out Spaghetti Western genre, into something big, bold and boisterous. True, the picture can seem a bit too lengthy and drawn out, however the character development, cinematography, set pieces and a vivid three act paradigm make this an instant classic, unlike anything predating it.Christoph Waltz had his coming-out party as Colonel Hans (Inglourious Basterds), which notably earned him an Oscar nod, however seeing his individualistic and stylistic monologues implemented into a paragon role, is something we've all been waiting for. Sure, the renegade is loveable in a dark, twisted and carefree way, but now that he has revealed his portrayal of Dr. King Schultz, it's unclear which role he's better at, which speaks to his overall talent bursting at the seams.It should not go without mentioning Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and of course, Jamie Foxx. DiCaprio's shining example of a true bias southern slave and plantation owner is remarkable, while 'Sammy Jacks' plays off this role as the loyal and all but sullen family butler/caretaker. Together the two lay the groundwork for red lining of the film, which ultimately Jamie Foxx's Django overcomes and shreds to pieces - a true thing of beauty to behold.The most interesting and tactful thing about Foxx's starring role is he simply plays off of the amazing performance of Waltz. There are many moments where Waltz dominates the dialogue, however as the story progresses, it is made clear who the plot is about - Django and Broomhilda, while Waltz assists. Waltz is cementing himself as an actor who boosts the success of his co-stars and even the protagonist, and this is as admirable as it is difficult.Overall the film was spectacular and will cement itself as an instant classic. The combined efforts of each star will be remembered as one of the best collaborations Tarantino has brought together in his directorial history. The most intriguing aspect of the film will be the lasting impact of the minuscule genre moving forward, and if it will flourish, or remain in the shadows.",10,0,2,6 January 2020
Lincoln," Daniel Day Lincoln
","Many have said, and many more will remember Abraham Lincoln as the most loved, heralded, and beloved president in the expansive, yet adolescent history of America. His unrelenting fervor that all people were created equal whether differing skin colors set apart or not, cemented itself through a tumultuous few years, which human dignity may now look back upon, smiling.Spielberg is known for many great and priceless directorial endeavors. From the mounting atmospheric difficulties on the set of Jaws in Martha's Vineyard, to the graphic, however sincere beauty of Schindler's List, to the innovation of computer technology and imagination with the always endearing Jurassic Park, one thing remains true through Steven's lengthy film career - he continues to amaze us all.Embarking upon the retelling of a man that altered the course of history forever is most certainly a task that carries certain and unmistakable intimidation and honor. Well, in short, Spielberg flourishes and delivers a film that deserves technical, as well as creative praise.Choosing to cast Academy Award Winner, Daniel Day-Lewis was the wildcard to the entire production, and ultimately what gave the film a sense of humility, honesty, and integrity; all of the qualities that Lincoln embodied. Constantly and consistently throughout the film, I sat in wonder at how strikingly similar he was to the many photos and portraits we have to this day of the real Abraham Lincoln.To make light of the ongoing war and methodical pace of the film, Lincoln (Day-Lewis) would unearth analytical jokes he heard during his earlier life as a lawyer, thus setting a nice pace for the two hour and twenty-nine minute haul. If these moments did indeed occur in the past, then Lincoln truly 'defined the era of which he was born into.'Tommy Lee Jones must also be notably mentioned, due to his knack for making a role his own, despite the inclination of what should or shouldn't be from certain standpoints. Bottom line: Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor and always remains a constant, never disappointing.The thing about this film that is quite remarkable is the focus on the overall depiction of how much burden Lincoln carried during his role as the 16th President of the United States. From personal grief, to national mourning, Lincoln carried the plethora of emotions within him, utilizing such as a propelling agent to achieve the supreme goal of seeing the 13th Amendment eclipse January of 1865.In closing, there was a story of lawyer and his pet parrot, told by Lincoln. You see, this parrot rattled on and on about the coming of the 'end of the world!' The lawyer, eventually tiring of this ongoing proclamation, killed the bird, thus fulfilling the doomsday message of the 'end of the world' for the parrot, at least.",9,2,3,6 January 2020
Elysium," Great Ideas, Bullet-holed Story
","The emergence of Neill Blomkamp's 'District 9' reinvigorated and seemingly repelled away from the overly mundane and monotonous Science Fiction flick that has plagued audiences for decades, which is why the production was extremely triumphant across all channels. Cinemas throughout the globe were enthralled and fed intravenously by the ingenious burst of creativity and vision, as well as the advent of Sharlto Copley' Wikus van der Merwe'.Fast-forwarding four years later, Blomkamp has once again bequeathed aspiration from the fathoms of his imagination and given moviegoers another rejuvenation that is immensely extravagant. 'Elysium' couples elements of Blomkamp's first success, with shiny new advances that arouse further expansion of the genre itself. The story, though somewhat linear, suffers from predictability, however, the roles of Damon, Foster, Fichtner and most irrevocably Copley, propel the story through almost seamlessly-intermixed with dazzling visual spectacles.While some may mourn the departure of the 'Halo' movie, 'Elysium' aggressively 'mans the reins' with fervor, passion, and dedication. The plethora of Sci-Fi fans that patiently entertain mediocre, high-budget brickbat movies, are most certainly and undeniably grinning from ear-to-ear after one hour and forty-three minutes of sheer delectation.",7,0,1,6 January 2020
The Artist," A Speechless Masterpiece and Master Class in Storytelling
","Michel Hazanavicius' 'The Artist' is truly an endeavor of artistic magnitude; void in most top tier films, let alone low tier.The story takes on the transcendence of human emotion, empathy and sensitivity, with more brilliance and tact than any film in recent history. The rustling, bustling, spitting representation of the Hollywood glitz and glamour at the beginning of the Golden Age of Film, intermixed with gloom the Great Depression caused, conveyed a sense of humility and mortality to Jean Dujardin's protagonist, George Valentin.As for his counterpart, Bérénice Bejo's Peppy Miller, she carried out her performance with extreme ease, sprinkled with magnificent delight of a visceral nature.Looking back over the thousands of films I've seen, only a handful caused me to weep from my very core, due to the sheer proficiency of which the thematic elements were presented.'The Artist' will forever be one of the great films of all-time; most indubitably- noteworthy to the defiant nature films portray when battling out for the top spot(s) in cinema history.This masterpiece has earned its way into my favorites list, which is seemingly impenetrable.",10,1,2,6 January 2020
