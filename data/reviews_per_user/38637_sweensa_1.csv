Hereditary," I don't get the great reviews.
","The trailer and junkets for this film looked fantastic, to be honest it ended there. O found myself dwindling on a number of occasions due to it being just pain dull. Most 'horror' movies have been done to death, (forgive the pun) but you don't mind if one is fun and enjoyable in some way . This had nothing going for it to entertain. I heard a story read out on a site from Rest if of a 'true story' recently, this was infinitely more interesting in the 5 mins it took to tell that this film could muster.",3,0,1,1 September 2018
