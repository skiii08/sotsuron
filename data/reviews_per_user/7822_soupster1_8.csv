The Equalizer," What was Denzel thinking...|?
","I don't mind rubbish, if it's entertaining rubbish. I don't even mind lazy film making, if it's at least on a par with other cheap entertainments... but this is garbage.I'm especially disappointed that Denzel Washington was in this. Indeed, I feel sorry for all the other actors (jobbing or otherwise) who clearly did their best... with this cheap imitation of a film.My general 'rule of thumb' for a bad movie, is that I could have written it. In this case... I could have written this when I was 7 years old.'Formulaic'. 'Robotic'. 'Unimaginative'. As exciting as unwrapping a new toilet roll. All I wanted was a half decent movie that delighted me with feelings of revenge, justice and juvenile type pleasing violence. Instead... I got pretentious posing, a ludicrous 'set up'... and enough clich√©s to last me a lifetime.Denzel Washington is far better than this turkey.",2,7,12,31 December 2014
John Wick," Hilarious
","Keanu Reeves has had problems being believable in most of the roles he has had throughout his career. I don't think he is a bad actor, but his acting coach must surely have been the most incompetent in Hollywood history. He plays exactly the same character in a tender love story, as he plays in an 'action' thriller.Now he does this. An 'action' thriller designed purely for 14 year old boys with pictures of cars on their bedroom walls. It plays out with the stock grunty voices (because tough men have no tonsils)... and the villains are Russian... with Russian accents only found in Los Angeles.Then they kill the cute puppy. Keanu gets so miffed that he opens up his secret basement full of big guns and even bigger bullets. At this point... I gave up. I don't mind mindless fun, but I do object if I have to be the mindless participant.Keanu... do The Lake House Part 2... That was a half decent film. This... is juvenile garbage that juveniles don't deserve.Staggeringly formulaic, dismally predictable... and hilariously bad.",1,21,40,20 February 2015
Darkest Hour," Embarrassing
","It should embarrass the academy that films can so easily follow a formula to get one of their little statues. This is not a bad film, it is merely not that good. The character of Churchill is always going to attract a bravura performance, and like many of his predecessors... Gary Oldman is more than up to the task. This however does not make it a 10/10 film.Considering that 10/10 has to represent a mark indicating that no better film has ever been made. It must be so excellent, that it towers above all other cinematic achievements other than comparable woks of genius.Historically. this is about as accurate as Spartacus, or Jason and the Argonauts. As a reading of the titular character... it offers nothing new at all. In fact... it is a series of not very well constructed cliches. This doesn't mean that Gary Oldman didn't deserve his little statue, it merely means that the standard for such an award... is lower than it should be. Let's face it... W.C.Fields might have been a nominee had he been around to audition.I might have managed a 6/10 but for the dreadful 'underground' scene. The 'chirpy' British, salt of the earth Londoners were a dreadful hodge-podge of extras that didn't make the final cut of Mary Poppins. Trying to make the truth fit a fiction only ever achieves irritating and patronising falsehood.
Surely Hollywood can do better than this?",5,3,4,22 May 2020
Match Point," Impressive.
","Woody Allen has a deserved reputation as a highly skilled film maker. He has a place in the history of Hollywood. Despite this... critics and the public have been both suspicious and doubtful about his work over the last 20 years or more.This film confirms beyond any doubt that Mr Allen is a master of his trade. To be able (as an American) to create such a plausible and accurate portrayal of English manners may not be a wondrous achievement in the way that Hollywood is so desperate to make us 'wonder'... but it is a delight. It is an experience to treasure because the story (transported by an exemplary cast) provides an insight into what being English really is. Smug, self satisfied wealth, sits alongside social conformity and naked lust. It completely ignores harsh reality of course... but what the hell!If I was better read... I am sure I would be able to give you all sorts of literary references to reinforce my opinions about this film... but I watch films for the emotional responses they drag out of me, and not much more.I like it. I am pleased to like it because it is Woody Allen... but I like it anyway.",9,1,4,9 April 2011
The Hateful Eight," Finally, I'm decided about Tarantino
","I've seen all of Quentin Tarantino's films, but have never been entirely convinced about his popularity among film goers. I've never disliked any of his films, but equally... I've never found any of them completely satisfying. Until now.I don't need to flex my 'amateur critic' muscles for this one. Quite simply... I enjoyed every moment of The Hateful Eight. It's been a while since I sat and watched a film, and forgot about everything but the screen.Basically, the acting keeps you entranced, until the story hooks you in. Then you sit back, and enjoy the ride. The actors give every sign of enjoying themselves immensely, and I spent a lot of time laughing, recoiling, wondering and gawping.I apologise Mr Tarantino, It took me a while... but you are indeed a fine film maker.",9,6,26,2 January 2016
Interstellar," I Had To Stop Watching...
","It starts off with a farmer (Independence Day style), and then we are quickly transported into a world where the planet is doomed because... well... we're not really sure why, but it involves a lot of wind.Then NASA gets involved and our heroes get sent into a kind of 'space' that comes complete with bad paintings of old 'hubble' pictures, lots of 'space' type language... and gravity. The gravity is ever present. Nothing ever floats about, and they get 'skipped' off the orbit around Mars before whizzing past Saturn (it has rings) and arriving at a black hole. They get through the black hole (like that's possible), by looking slightly concerned and talking like cowboys.The robots look and act like corn flake boxes, the humans (mostly well known), look bemused... and at that point... I had to stop watching. I was hoping it was all going to turn out to be a joke... but it wasn't.I don't like ranting, so I won't. Suffice to say that if the Earth has to end... at least let it explode before Hollywood can make another 'turkey' like this.Embarrassingly bad.",1,36,76,21 January 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Philosophy made slapstick
","This is a 'Marmite' film. You will either love it, or hate it. I loved it. It has historical and philosophical depth, while blatantly and unashamedly... making you laugh at it's many examples of parody, pastiche and clowning.I don't know how much of it was 'CGI', but the Set Designers and Dressers must all be in some sort of 'rest home' by now. Sumptuous, bleak and evocative all seem to describe what we see.No source of humour is left unplumbed. Wit, shameless mugging and hapless slapstick, are all employed... and with a lot more 'hits' than 'misses'. The 'stellar' cast actually produce a 'stellar' film... for once.I recommend this film, the trouble is... I'm not entirely sure who I am recommending it to. Try this... if you like your entertainment to be clever, charming... and untrustworthy at the same time... you will like this. It might also help if you prefer Monty Python to 'Everyone Loves Raymond'. Even if you enjoyed both.",8,1,3,4 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The most over-hyped movie of all time...
","... Has arrived. Fuelled by a hate campaign against it's original creator, an outpouring of irrational love for it's original release (by a squadron of people not yet born)... and enriched by the childhood memories of people whose 'childhood' was nowhere near as important as they think it was. Star Wars is back... and it's like it never went away.Perhaps because it didn't...? Robin Hood and Maid Marion somehow survived the intervening years, and the Sheriff of Nottingham left his foul stench all over the piece. Ironically making a pong all over Christmas.For all their faults... the 'prequels' were at least serious attempts to add to the story. Episode 7 is a retelling... that is both clumsy and obvious. If the 'fanboys' are happy with this... then the 'fanboys' have had way too much attention given to them.I saw the original release in 1977. It was good... but it didn't change my life. It was, after all... just a movie. The new version is like watching a remake. One with little to enhance the original.George Lucas brought us a film that was different... Disney has brought us a film that is almost exactly the same. So why the fuss...???",5,21,26,23 April 2016
