The Longest Yard," A worthy remake
","Normally i do not like remakes but the Longest Yard showed me that, though a remake can never match the original, they can still be pretty good. Peter Segal managed to make a decent movie here. Sheldon Turner's new screenplay was funny and exciting. Though there wasn't enough character development, i still enjoyed this. I had one problem with casting, though. Adam Sandler does not seem like a former NFL qb. With such big names the acting should be good and it was. Sandler, Rock, and Reynolds were all superb in this movie. The supporting actors including Nelly and Michael Irvin were also good. Teddy Castellucci's musical score reminded me of Holes, especially when Sandler was on the bus. I enjoyed the shots of the prison in the desert and the big game was well shot. Overall cinematography by Dean Semler was good. Though The Longest Yard cannot match the original, it is still a worthy remake worth seeing.",6,0,2,10 October 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good movie...yet bad movie
","What can i say about this film that already hasn't been said? Its excellent in almost every aspect. The cinematography is gorgeous, acting is wonderful by everybody except Orlando Bloom (even though his action scenes are good) (and also because the character of Legolas wasn't fleshed out enough), writing is good and not too many important scenes were cut out of the book, o and did i say the cinematography was gorgeous? Now to the few negatives. I already said Blooms acting was bad. But the thing that really made me give this movie a 9 out of 10 was Peter Jackson. His career as a horror movie maker really hurt him in this wonderful movie. Several scenes (such as the Uruks being born out of those mud sacs) (the scene were Galadriel goes all psycho) (some of the battle scenes were there was blood and gore) could only have been imagined by a horror fan. Everything else was excellent. The special effects were amazing (now i know why George Lucas wanted to make his first Star Wars movies in the late 20th and 21st century). Even though it was 3 hours long the movie moves smoothly, only getting stuck a few times (the love scenes). If you thought this movie was terrible you 1)cant appreciate a good film 2)need to take a chill pill and 3)must have some nervous disorder if you cant still to watch an excellent movie like this.",9,0,1,6 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An excellent addition to the series
","Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better.",9,6,8,13 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton pulls it off!
","8.3/10 When i saw the trailer for this film i thought it would be a terrible copy designed to get money with a popular name. I was wrong. Tim Burton does an amazing job with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Lets start with the acting. At first i thought Depp was a bad choice but he gives us a superb and different portrayal of Willy Wonka. I hate his haircut though. Freddie Highmore as Charlie was also excellent and he fit his role well. David Kelly as Grandpa Joe was pretty good but not excellent. Helena Carter and Noah Taylor also did a good job. Annasophia Robb, Julia Winter, Jordan Fry and Phillip Wiegratz all fit their roles perfectly as the bratty children and were very convincing. John August's screenplay was almost perfect. I liked the part about Wonka's childhood with Christopher Lee. Some of Wonka's lines were bad but overall the screenplay was funny and refreshing. My biggest problem with this movie was Danny Elfman's terrible oompa loompa songs. They are nothing like the catchy tunes from the original movie. Usually i like Elfman though. The cinematography of Rousselot shows the wondrous factory and Charlies poor family's house. Tim Burton has made an excellent movie out of otherwise used material. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though many reviews criticized it.",8,6,10,1 August 2005
