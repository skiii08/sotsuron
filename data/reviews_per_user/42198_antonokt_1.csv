Vertigo," Good movie but confusing ðŸ˜‚
",I thought the characters were fun end well played from the actors. but the story was kinda confusing to me maybe because I didn't now how vertigo works or something. And that music was well played with the movie and the colours. What I like the most about the movie is how well it was played compared to when it was made. But I didn't like how confusing it was.,8,0,1,2 December 2019
