The Equalizer," Not bad
","This isn't a bad movie. It's not a 7, but not a 6 like I rated it. Somewhere in the middle. Why? Ahhhhhhhh it's a modern version of The Book Of Eli. I guess if you have seen John Wick you have seen this movie. Good movie just not original.",6,0,1,22 November 2018
A Star Is Born," Wow
",Wow was it better than what people had said. That being said. Yes it's long. Yes it's like Queens movie. Yes it is another version of Pretty Women. A chick flick.,7,0,2,4 May 2019

Fight Club," Never have seen this movie tell now
","Never have seen this movie before. 8.8 is terribly high. It was good, probably good for it's time. Now I have seen American History X, that was a great movie. I see alot of that movie in Fight Club. Then thank you Jim Carrey with Me Myself and Irene, and ripping off Fight Club.",6,0,2,10 July 2018

Aquaman," The best graphics as a movie
","Yes, I never have seen a movie with these great graphics!!! DC step it game up!!!! Thank You with Hollywood pushing out garage. With Marvel thinking they are the best, so they got political with Black Panther. Please Marvel and Hollywood, stop with ur hate towards Trump!!! Worry about making great movies. This movie past you guys.",8,0,1,19 April 2019
Deadpool 2," Don't believe the hype
","Is this movie an 8 like the 1st one? No. Is it bad? No. Is it worth a watch? Yes. It's funny, but you will see the same jokes you did before. Kinda like the movie Logan for a plot. The plot was weak. There were some new funny things in it. That was the best part of it. Cable was pretty awesome, so was the girl with Lucky power. Was that one scene from Fortnite? Lol....I can see why Avengers Infinity War did better in the theaters.",7,0,1,16 August 2018
X-Men," Great movie
","Hugh is a stud, don't know why he asked the Rock to get fit. He was fit in this movie. I get why Famke n James are in it, ( Disturbing Behavior).",7,0,0,18 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," Sad
","Too bad they went down with this movie. The 1st one was great. This one, the love story is ok. The story and plot is average. The graphics are good. May have had too many bad guys(3). When Batman started to do that, it went down too. They had to start over. That explains why Spiderman started over with The Amazing Spiderman.",6,0,0,5 December 2018
Ready Player One," Great movie!!!
",I can now see why this movie had high ratings coming out of the theaters. It's worth it!! Different movie with great graphics. If I had to say what it's like: Tron and Avatar. I loved all the 80s stuff in it too!! Keep it up Hollywood!!,7,0,1,31 July 2018
Molly's Game," Wow, I was impressed
","I didn't want to be the 1st of my friends to watch. I wasn't sure if I'd like it. I couldn't get my friends to watch to tell me if it's good. One day on Prime Day it was for sale for $4. I got it, wow was I surprised. This was a great movie, and i picked it up for $4!!!!",7,1,2,25 July 2018
Interstellar," 2nd time around
","1st time I watched it, I didn't know what to think. The 2nd time a few years later. Hmmm I would say, a bit slow and long. That's the huge downfall. You need to be in the right mood to watch it. The actors, OMG it's a huge cast!!!!!! All in all it's not a 8.6 out of 10. It's somewhere in the 6s, because you have to be in the right mood and have a lot of time on your hands.",6,1,2,13 December 2018
Predator," Classic 80s movie
",Loved growing up with this movie as a kid. Way beyond it's time.,7,0,1,16 May 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," A bit over 7 out of 10
","It's not an 8 out of 10. That being said, this movie is just as good as La Bamba and The Doors. It hit most truths bout Fred and Queen. Good remembrance of Live Aid.",7,1,1,28 January 2019
Man of Steel," Hollywood rip offs
",I really liked this back in 2013. Then I watched a movie I did NOT like (The Arrival). Then I researched this Man Of Steel. Well I know where they came up with The Arrival. Man Of Steel is the alien version of Superman. Yes this movie is still better than Superman Returns.,6,1,4,29 November 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Just average
",This movie is average. Nothing new but the story of a husband and wife in the future. Alot of things same from T2. Alot of lines too. Missing is the bad guy from T2 and Sarah Connor. They really made an impact in T2. This is just an average action/sci-fi movie.,5,1,3,20 June 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Probably the best woman hero!!!!
","Not too many sequels do as well as the 1st movie. This movie holds itself up high. Probably one of the strength of the movie is today's Hollywood search of a bad a$$ woman hero. To Red Sparrow(Jennifer Lawrence) to Atomic Blonde(Charlize Theron) and to Revenge (Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz). Hollywood REALLY wants to find that bad woman, you did Hollywood her name IS Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)!!!!! Please bring her back to us. She is my 1st choice to redeem Sarah Connor, but if not her I would recommend these 2 stud women: 1st Evangeline Lilly and 2nd Brooke Ence!!!!!",8,2,2,17 June 2018
Edward Scissorhands," Different
","It's way different, but today it's an ok movie. Sorry to the producer.",6,0,0,26 April 2018
Spider-Man," Great movie!!
","Great movie then and today. This was a good Peter Parker. The Green guy reminded me of the Joker. Not only that, the people choice Spiderman over him. Same as the Joker in Batman with the boat to blow up part.",7,0,0,2 December 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good movie
",This is a good movie. The actors did a great job. Changing actors is tough. Changing the story a bit is tough. They did good. The bad guy is what I didn't like. That's all.,7,1,2,7 December 2018
54," Just ok!!!
","If you put Cocktails and Boogie Nights together you get 54. Wait Boogie Nights came out just before 54??!!! Another one of Hollywood's tricks to make a similar movie. Yes Mike Myers played a great actor. His laugh, LOL!!!",5,0,0,23 May 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," I don't give out 8's very often
","This movie is VERY great. Well done, maybe one of the best Xmen movies. Very deep too. Wish Hollywood would do more like this movie.",8,1,1,29 May 2018
Die Hard 2," This is a good movie.
","This is a good movie. I hate given it a 6, but it's nowhere near a 7. Alot of things repeated from the 1st classic movie. Yes there were some new bad ass scenes though. For that it's a 6. A 6 isn't a bad thing. It's a good movie not just a bad ass movie.",6,0,4,27 June 2018
Flashdance," Not what I thought
","With a good note, soundtrack is great. It's almost just an average movie. Kinda is. Just another Footloose n Dirty Dancing. Best parts are the girls dancing in underwear. Not today, girl dancers are different. 4 movie but 5 cause the girls are hot. Story is so so.",5,1,1,10 June 2018
Wreck-It Ralph," Unbelievable good movie

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Just as good as the 1st
",Jeff Goldblum comes back and delivers. Great 2nd movie. There are tons of scenes and movies that rip off this one.,7,90,242,16 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Great movie!!!
","I really lived Civil War, this was equal or better. The humor was back to were it should have gone, unlike Thor Ragnarok. Guardians Of The Galaxy actors were fun and great. Same for Iron Man. Great movie, thanks Hollywood!!!",8,2,5,14 August 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," I usually give at least 1 star to a movie staring a person from the TV show Lost
",This is a darker xmen movie. I don't care for it as much. The make Jean Grey very bad.,5,0,1,23 May 2018
Good Will Hunting," Never had seen it tell 2018
","Love the GIFs n other funny spin offs from this movie. Loved seeing guys from Dazed n Confused in it together. Kinda a sweet love story. Good plot, a bit stolen for Thor. Still it's not a 8.3 out of 10 movie. Yes good though.",6,3,7,3 August 2018
The Incredibles," Wow back then
","Back when this movie came out, it was HUGE. It should be. After rewatching it since then??? Not as good or better as then. Good movie, but I'd give it more of a 7 than an 8.",7,0,1,15 November 2018
A Quiet Place," Emily Blunt the Alien Killer

X-Men: Apocalypse," This is one of the BEST X-Men
",Of all the X-Men this is bad a$$. Great effects. The graphics are killer. The story is great. The fast guy from American Horror Story is great. Besides he's the Flash. The Flash needs to learn from him.,8,0,1,30 May 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," More like 5.9
","It's a good movie, but it's not a 6, I voted 6, because it's better than 5. I liked the actors again. Just not the 2 bass guys. That was the downfall of the movie. Don't know why they changed the Spiderman actor in Homecoming???",6,0,0,13 December 2018
Transformers," I'd say more a 7.7
",It's very close to a 8. This movie was awesome when it came out. Then I watched it too many times. Then I watched movies today. Alot of em THEY clam are 7 or 8s but they end up 5 or 6 after time. Rewatching it after a crap load of poop movies Hollywood has come out with. This movie is epic comepared to those. The graphics are amazing. The actors do a great job. As a fan of transformers as a kid. This movie does a great job to give you goosebumps.,7,0,0,15 December 2018

","Just another version of the Breakfast Club, but in the 90s version.",6,1,4,14 April 2018

Sicario," Not bad
","It's 2018, Hollywood loves to make Mexicans look like innocent people in movies cause of Trump. Watch this movie and they are bad drug dealers trying to get to the US. When was it made? 2014, before Trump was the President. Hmmmmmm Hollywood. That being said, it was an ok movie. Kinda reminded me of a backward Scareface. A bit slow for me though.",6,0,2,30 September 2018
Thor," Soooo much better than Thor Ragnarok!!!!
","If you say Thor Ragnarok is better than this u are a bot. Lol look at all the people, where are they in Ragnarok. What 500 people lol. You have a HOT chick too!!! This IS a great movie by MARVEL!!!",8,2,3,15 May 2018
The Shape of Water," Good but WTF!!!
",WTF is Hollywood pushing on us. For one this movie is good only to Hell Boy 1 n 2 movies. Still you watch this it's colored like Dick Tracy. Again there are so many other movies that could be pushing 8's like Molly's Game.,6,2,2,26 July 2018

Shooter," Good movie
","This was a good movie back in 07. I watched it alot back then. Today, it's ok. Kinda reminds me of The Fugitive. Plus I can see why they had the girl play in this movie now.

Black Panther," Lion King??????!!!!!!
","With all the hype in the theaters, I was like REALLY??? Then the media gave this movie alot of hype. Well I know why. Not my king!!! Maybe just change it to ( Not my president). U can see the political agenda. If Marvel wants to go THAT route? They will loose fans quickly like NFL or the Grammys. The humor? Terrible, (what are those?), (Shut up or I'll feed u to my children!! No we're vegetarians....hahahaha!!) Lame jokes. The worst thing is this is a remake of the Lion King. It doesn't take any brains to see that. So ALL the 6 or above out of 10s have to be FAKE votes. Funny I don't read reviews before watching a movie, I'm not the only one who sees Lion King in this movie. Just YouTube it, it's real. I WILL NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN, no need.",5,3,4,14 May 2018

","This movie went to the future and back too. The action is bad a$$. The computer stuff made it up to date. Him wanting to save his bad a$$ daughter was great. Everything was great, but one thing. The bad guy. He's not really a bad guy like in the other Die Hards. Still I liked it better than 2 and 3.",7,2,2,1 July 2018
X2: X-Men United," It is better than the 1st one.

Thor: The Dark World," Good movie

Annihilation," I want to like it!!
","I really want to like this movie, but it reminds me of the movie Body Snatchers or the Thing. They tried to be scientific, but I could see threw it. It's slow, but the plus is you get the WTF is that every once in awhile. Those WTF is what keeps it going. I ask myself (would you watch it again?) The answer is (NO), so that's why I give it a 5. Just an average movie. If you never watch it your not missing out.",5,0,1,1 June 2018

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Not bad movie
",It wasn't a bad movie. The graphics were good. The story was alright. Sometimes it felt a bit long. I would say that was the down fall. Megan Fox? She didn't break or make the film.,6,1,2,6 January 2019
The Wedding Singer," Awesome
