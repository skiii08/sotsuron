The Blair Witch Project," It could happen to YOU !!
","I am not going to write a long essay about the film but what I would like to say is that for all the people who think this movie was rubbish then all I have to say is that You have NO imagination!The movie is not about good acting, special effects or anything like that. It is about putting yourselves in the character's shoes and thinking about how YOU would react to the situation. Where I live in Scotland, there are plenty of dark creepy woods, and after watching TBW it gives me the creeps to go anywhere near them!
