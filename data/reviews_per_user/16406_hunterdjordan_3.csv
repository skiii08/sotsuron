Blade Runner 2049," Slightly better than the first
","I have just finished watching this for the second time and i have to say the second viewing was more enjoyable. The film is gorgeous. From the cinematography to the sets, lighting, colors, music, everything. Now of course my rating of 8 implies there's some flaws which there are.The problems i have are fairly minimal. The first being the soundtrack. The soundtrack isn't bad, it's just quite loud. I know that's kind of a strange complaint, but since i watch movies with surround sound, it gets quite irritating. The first Blade Runner has an amazing soundtrack that fits perfectly with the film, this one even though it has a good soundtrack, feels out of place in some scenes.The next complaint is some of the performances, mainly Jared Leto. I like Jared Leto, i think he's a capable actor, it just feels like he's going too over the top for my liking.There are quite a lot of great things that i appreciate about this film. The first is that they don't immediately explain things, allowing the audience to pick up on things rather than writing exposition and showing it down our throats. It treats the viewers as if they're intelligent.The story is not necessarily unique, but it's presented in a nice, smart, and skilled way.I would recommend this to pretty much anyone, including fans of the book and original movie.",8,1,7,8 March 2018
The Shape of Water," Overrated but good.
","I saw this film before the Oscars and wasn't too impressed, so seeing it win Best Picture even though there was superior films in the same category.The positive aspects of the film - The Cinematography. The shots in the film are well done, especially the opening shot which is just gorgeous. The framing, lighting and sets are very good.Acting - The performances in this film are strong. Sally Hawkins does a great showing emotion with just her body language and facial expressions. Jenkins also does a great job and Spencer. All around great performances.Music - The music is something i think carries the film. If it wasn't for the great score i might consider dropping it to a 6, but the main piano ballad kept getting stuck in my head.The negativesThe script - All of my problems come from the script. Cliched, predictable and at times ill-thought-out. It's hard to think that this top secret facility as such very little security. No cameras in the room housing the creature, and yes in Strickland's office there was cameras but there wasn't any in the room? and There also isn't outside the door? Not to mention she essentially blared music inside the creatures room, and no it's not sound proofed because when Strickland got attacked by the creature we clearly heard him screaming.The movie was very coincidental and in return hard to get immersed.7/10",7,1,8,5 March 2018
Black Panther," A marvel movie at the core
","Before seeing this film, i was hoping it to differentiate itself from the rest of the MCU films.It didn't. It's simply a marvel movie, which isn't a compliment. The writing is mediocre. Characters are basic. You got your perfect hero, that doesn't have any character flaws. Love interest that does little to nothing. Villain that has a motivation that seems to change throughout the film. Any other character discussion would result in spoilers. There's a lot of cringe worthy lines. Bad jokes are littered throughout this film. And a lot of stuff that made me unintentionally laugh.The visual effects are quite bad. Black Panther looks rubbery, and plain fake. The MCU seems to look faker by each installment.The music is probably the only unique thing about this film. They used a lot of African Percussion and hip hop instrumentation, which is something i can appreciate. It adds to the atmosphere and helps make it somewhat unique.So when you watch this movie don't expect a well made film. Expect a formulaic movie that's only intention is to sell toys and sell tickets.",5,0,0,26 May 2018
