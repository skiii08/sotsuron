The Blair Witch Project," Unbelievable, Shocking (Yeah, Right!)
","I couldn't believe the disconnect between the critical acclaim for this 'film' and the audience reaction when I saw it, (which was a giant collective yawn).  Anyone who has done any type of camping, hiking, backpacking, etc. will find the premise absurd.  How these three people could even walk far enough into the woods to get lost; (next to a stream?, next to a road?) with all that equipment is beyond me.The only scary thing about this movie would be the threat of a sequel.",1,1,3,29 August 1999
