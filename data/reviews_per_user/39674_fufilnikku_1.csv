","I am pretty sure that there is awful lot of information available in other reviews about how bad this movie is. Let me just summaries my feelings after having the misfortune of paying to watch this movie in the following few lines: If I could go back in time, I would like to knock myself out with a punch just before I am about to enter the cinema to watch this movie.

Should have stuck with established story line. The trailer is now among the greatest lies told on internet.",3,29,65,30 April 2013
