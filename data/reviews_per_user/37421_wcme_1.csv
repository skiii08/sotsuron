The Blair Witch Project," Best film I have ever seen
","This is one of these situations that clearly show what sorry state we are at as a viewing public...for those of you who enjoyed 'The Sixth Sense' and bombed this one, it goes to show you that mindless folk need to be entertained by elements like scary music, music 'Stings' that make dim witted folk jump when a shadow runs behind someone and they dont see it, and the fact that they need a screaming, spinning bloody CGI Blair witch on screen cutting the campers in half with hellfire to be entertained.
Sad.This movie was all about people, people you see everyday, the checkout guy at the Acme, the car wash worker, the DJ on the radio, your babysitter....and what they do when you dont see them..alone at night in the basement, up in the woods with goats and black candels on a saturday night...Cults and evil power....The take I have is that there was a group of folks in a cult, in this small town, that did what the wanted up in the hills and used the Blair Witch legend as cover for themselves. It could be anyone, anyone that walks into a place outside where they should go, that gets in a situation like these 3 did. They were played with like mice by Cats for days, starved, awoke at night so no one could rest, and toutured and killed. Sure, strange things happened, but when you are young, have never camped before, and are tired and being abused you make mistakes and go in circles. A 'Witch' didnt make and hang those symbols of power from the trees, or pile rocks outside the tent....The things that you DONT see in your mind make you far more scared then any cgi computer could ever produce (see the scorpion king at the end of the mummy returns) and this film reminds you of noises your house makes in the middle of the night. Is someone there? in the dark?I didnt sleep for weeks, and will be a long time getting over these thoughts.Who are these strangers around me in this town? what are they capable of? Keep your eyes open....",Null,0,1,26 April 2002
