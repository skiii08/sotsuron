Vertigo," Where a dizzy plot and story leave this viewer behind...
","When I first saw this movie in 1959, I was bored to tears, almost. As a teenager, I wanted action, and the film and story seemed to be lacking in that regard. Only when Psycho (1960) came along did my appreciation of Hitchcock increase. As to Vertigo's story, the above short synopsis from filmfactsman provides sufficient information for those who haven't seen the movie.However, over fifty years later, I watched Vertigo for a second time and I must say my initial assessment was similar: the film's action drags with too much walking, shadowing and following, coupled with too much driving, following and shadowing. Appropriate jump-cutting could have been used a number of times – and shorten viewers' pains in the process, I think.On the flip side though, I can now fully appreciate Hitchcock's filming technique to show how Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) grapples with the mystery of Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) and how he unravels it. Though I'm sure there were more shot-reverse shot sequences in this movie than in any other of Hitchcock's.However, what the film truly lacks overall, in my opinion, is effective suspense – sufficient to keep this viewer fully interested in what will happen, and when and why. Hence, it's even a more of a puzzle to me why Vertigo has now replaced Citizen Kane (1941) as 'the best movie of all time' (or words to that effect). Sure, both stories are mysteries, but the latter packs more of a punch for viewers from the get-go; and the revelation at the end provides greater dramatic irony than that in Vertigo. Indeed, one could argue that Vertigo's irony is weak, at best, and just corny at worst.Moreover, one wonders how a supposedly intelligent ex-cop could be so stupid to be sucked in twice by the same – but different – woman. Love is blind, I guess, as always.And, finally, the entire story of Vertigo is just too predictable, in addition to having a dialog that's just plain dull much of the time. Technically, as I implied, the actual filming is excellent, as you would expect from Hitchcock; and the color is just so vividly vibrant. But that's not enough for me to regard it as anything more than just that: a well-constructed film with few errors.James Stewart – always more effective in comedy and westerns, in my opinion – is just not right for the role. Kim Novak, on the other hand, is most effective, providing her best acting role that I've seen. And, as always, Barbara Bel Geddes is a most suitable supporting player as one of Stewart's old flames.I'm glad I've seen the movie again. And I do recommend it for all Hitchcock fans, for sure. But it's no where near his best effort: too long, too slow, too predictable and too light on suspense. Give this one six out of ten – and I'm being generous.January 2nd, 2013",6,5,11,2 January 2013
The New World," The New World  where the legend of Pocahontas lives on...
","At around 135 minutes, this is a long film and there are those who would say that's about sixty minutes too long. Don't take any notice of them because if you're a Terence Malick fan, then you're in for another visual treat of sublime excellence.Of course, if you're not a fan of that philosopher-director, then you'd better give this one a miss  even with Colin Farrell in the lead as Capt. John Smith.  because this film is not one for action fans, nor for those who like lots of dialog.This is for the visually attuned and informed viewer only, and for those who just like to listen to a great musical score for film.If you know anything about the story of Pocohontas, then you know it's a putative love story between Capt. Smith and her, during the time that settlers arrived at the site of modern Jamestown in 1607. Malick follows the generally accepted story  Pocohontas saves Smith from death when he is captured, falls in love with him but, after Smith leaves and is reported as being dead, she marries John Rolfe, travels to England with him and eventually dies there from some unspecified disease. The whole story is in a number of history books, you can access it at one online database I know of, but you really don't need to know anymore.Instead, just sit and watch how Malick uses the camera, sound, and editing to produce a lyrical tribute to the power of love  'there is only this  all else is unreal', according to the character of Smith. Don't try to listen to the dialog too intently, especially Farrell's affected thick Irish brogue that is incomprehensible at times. Be prepared for one very dramatic battle scene between the settlers and the local tribes, reminiscent of Malick's treatment of men in hand-to-hand combat in The Thin Red Line (1998): hand-held cameras, quick sharp cutting and editing, close-ups of men dying horribly and such like  although it never reaches the goriness of that great war film. I'm sure, for Malick that this particular battle is incidental to the greater power of the love story that he wanted to present.Just watch how Malick again treats the viewer with the splendor of Nature: crystal clear underwater shots, slow shots of light through trees, languid shots of wind riffling the long grasses and bushes of the Virginia coastline, stunning sunrises and sunsets, and male and female voice-overs that draw the viewer into the innermost thoughts of the protagonists. Those are all almost trademarks of Malick that he has used before, most notably in the above war film, and they are still very effective in holding this viewer, without pause.I hope it holds you equally well.",8,0,1,19 September 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Where righting a wrong could mean doing wrong, even when you're right
","Is this a thrilling comedy or a comedic thriller?There's a good cast here, with Freeman, Kingsley, Tucci and Willis doing their thing and in their usually competent manner. And, there's Josh Hartnett (whom I'd seen before in Black Hawk Down and Sin City) who takes on the role of Slevin  the wrong man in this narrative.Which is -- when all I said and done  a pure spoof of the gangster/crime genre and can be reviewed sensibly only from that perspective. But, it's not as bad or as good (depending upon your own point of view) as those spoofs that Leslie Nielsen (The Naked Gun etc) does in his sleep, practically.Quite simply, the story is stupendously stupid but, along the way, there are some very witty lines, some delicious ironic twists, and the usual run of bloody murders. So, it's all a lot of 'good' fun, despite the rising body count and the almost total amorality of the characters  the exception being Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who tags along with Slevin and his problems. However, take away the comedy, change the narrative slightly, and you'd have a viable comparison to other recent gangster movies -- e.g. The Departed (2006), for one -- and a film noir contender. What a pity it wasn't done that way; it would have been a more gripping and more believable story  instead of a black comedy that was trying to be serious.Hence, as presented, the story is simply a framework upon which to hang different traps, pitfalls, and surprises for the delight (or frustration) of most viewers. Frankly, I nearly fell asleep in the first forty minutes (well, it was very late at night too, when I watched this one) and only perked up when the first surprise popped up. Sorry  can't say what it is, because that would spoil it for you, and the rest of the story. Bummer, huh?The production is slick  but I think it was done on the cheap (no crashed cars, trains, planes, etc and a minimum of sets)  the filming is competent, but the editing is a bit jerky. I loved the dialog, the verbal jousting, the innuendo and the lies that keep you guessing  or just totally confused. Whatever...Is it worth watching? Yes, simply to see how a lot of good actors make a bundle of money having a lot of fun. And, you might have a bit of fun along the way also.",6,0,1,19 May 2007
Training Day," Not what the rookie expected...but it was ordered
","Finally, a movie where Denzel Washington plays the bad guy! And, wins a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor. Moreover, Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.So, this movie has two great performances to see, as the rogue cop, Alonzo Harris (Washington) takes on the new wannabe narc rookie, Jake (Hawke) on his very first day on the job. And, what a day it is...There are three threads to this complex plot: first, Alonzo has the Russian Mafia after him and must deal with the problem or die  there's a contract out on him, and those Russian types just don't mess around; Alonzo also has a group of dirty cops who are getting ready to take down another long-time dirty cop who's been supplying drugs for years  and Alonzo and his gang intend to cash in; and, finally, Alonzo has a do-gooder rookie who thinks he's on the job to actually do good for others, instead of just doing good for himself  money-wise that is.So, where're the real bad guys, you ask? Well, they're either wearing suits and pulling Alonzo's chain in the big end of town or, they're sitting on the sidelines of the really bad areas, waiting for Alonzo and his buddies to mess things up for themselves  so that they can then cash in...A big part of the plot is somewhat artificial because Jake's eventual success, shall I say, on his first day comes only as a result of a very fortuitous co-incidence when he saves a young schoolgirl from an attempted rape. It's a crucial event, and I suppose the screenwriter figured that only one unlikely co-incidence was okay. I guess so...Apart from that, it is a fast paced, beautifully edited and photographed, non-stop, rip-roaring, pulsating, wisecracking, boom and bust, kick-butt action movie that left me dazed after first viewing. A second viewing helped to clear up some of the more confusing details. You might want to watch it twice also, but if you like Denzel, then you'll watch this one at least once.",8,21,30,9 October 2006
Chinatown," You never know what's really going on, especially in Chinatown
","Philosophically, the story of J.J. 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is almost a tragedy: once he was a cop in Chinatown, and made a blunder that cost a woman her life. Now, in this narrative, he's a tough, cynical but fair-minded PI and is about to ignore history  and, as we know, those who ignore it are bound to repeat it...You see, Jake was hired to expose the putative extra-marital affair of one Hollis Mulwray, a big wig with the water Board for the City of Los Angeles. Trouble is, Mulwray doesn't behave like a man on an affair, but more like one on a mission. So, Jake's intrigued, and even more so as the intrigue deepens when Mulwary turns up dead  drowned. And, as Jake discovers further, murdered.Tangled up in the murder is, of course, Mrs Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) who, at first, tries to obstruct Jake but later engages his services to find out who killed Hollis. Along the tortuous way, Jake bumps into Noah Cross (John Huston), Mrs Mulwray's father, who just happened to have been partner to Hollis Mulwray years earlier. Cross, in turn, engages Jake to find the young woman who was supposed to be having an affair with Hollis. Why is Cross so interested in that young woman? Indeed...That's what Jake wants to know too; and the only person he can ask is Mrs Mulwray who, as the story progresses, the LAPD suspect as being the killer of Hollis. But is she? Jake's determined to find out, and so sets an elaborate trap for the person he thinks did the dirty job of killing Hollis; and also devises a daring plan to get Mrs Mulwray to Mexico and beyond the reach of his one-time buddies at the LAPD. Why does Jake do the latter? Because he's in love with her, or so he thinks, and is willing to risk his career, jail, loss of PI license or whatever to make sure she stays free. Trouble is, Jake doesn't realize he's made a terrible blunder again...when he meets her in Chinatown.In the great tradition of film-noir, Chinatown ranks with the best. The period mise-en-scene is picture perfect; the music soundtrack is quintessentially moody; the dialog is cracking with one-liners and irony; the femme fatale is disturbingly haunting, twice over, as you will discover.The overall production testifies to the great expense and detail that brought the whole story and cast together. Add the standout performances from Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston for the icing to a layer cake mystery that will stay with you for a long time.Arguably Polanski's best directorial effort and one, in my opinion, that should have won the Oscar for that year. They just don't make movies like this any more. Pity.Highly recommended.",9,2,5,2 January 2008
Se7en," Where a misanthrope turned sociopath provides seven deadly lessons.
","On this, my second viewing of Seven (after sixteen years), the flaws in the story and production are more apparent. That knowledge hasn't reduced my admiration and appreciation of this film, however: the script is tight and sharp; the acting is just brilliant; and the photography and editing are all you would expect from a finely crafted thriller that uses dramatic irony, terror and horror to great effect. Add to that the moody mise-en-scene in drab, dark de-saturated color which just makes all of the cityscape so much more unappealing and implicitly menacing.For those who haven't seen it, this is the story: a seriously deranged man plans and implements a series of ghastly murders, each of which is thematically linked to one of the seven deadly sins. Beginning with gluttony and so on to each sin, the plot involves the efforts of a thirty-year, world-weary veteran detective, William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) – Somerset is appropriate name because he's on the eve of his retirement to his rural property – and a gung-ho hotshot youngster, David Mills (Brad Pitt), who together begin the task of sifting through the deliberately planted clues to hunt down the killer. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Mills' wife, Tracy, and does a beautiful job with the few scenes she is in; more importantly, she acts as the linchpin for the final horrific ending.So, to that extent, it's normal fare for a crime thriller (recall, for example, The Bone Collector or, more recently, No Country for Old Men).What sets it apart, to a large extent, are the succession of extremely bloody and violent crime scenes we see as a result of each murder, leaving no doubt in viewers' minds about the cruelty exhibited by the killer. Frankly, it's much better filmic technique for developing the character of the killer than witnessing each murder in action (for which we should be thankful, in my opinion).The story is set in an unnamed city (but was shot mostly around Los Angeles) and it's raining most of the time. Actually, not quite: it's raining on cars when there are interior shots in autos but, in the background, it's mostly sunny, quite obviously. A slight flaw, I know, but it's very obvious on second viewing. More serious, in my opinion, is the story itself: the whole premise of using the seven deadly sins as thematic, murderous underpinnings for each crime lacks credibility. In the real world, it's just not believable – the sine qua non, after all, for excellent story-telling – when all of the factors about the killer's preparations and implementation are revealed. Hence, to that extent, Seven is fantasy.Granted, The Bone Collector (1999) suffers in the same way. But, not so No Country for Old Men (2006). And still the best, recent example of believable story about serial murders is The Silence of the Lambs (1991).Still, if you like unrelenting suspense build-up, then Seven is a movie to see, for sure. Apart from the good aspects already mentioned above, I have to include a minor spoiler and make special mention of Kevin Spacey who plays the role of the killer: if ever there was a guy meant to play the role, it is he. Even though we see him only in the last half-hour (except for a brief moment in the second act which, if you're not alert, you will miss completely), he dominates everything as only Spacey can.You can theorize about the rationale for making the movie (other than as money-maker) as an indictment of modern city-living, a commentary on the base nature of humanity in general, or as an extreme example of how the dark side of personality disorder can wreak urban havoc – or all three, of course.Don't bother, is my advice; just sit back and...be entertained, perhaps? Overall, I give it seven...hmmm.July, 2011.",Null,0,1,29 June 2011
Unbreakable," Which shows that true heroes are born, not made.
","Years ago, I read a newspaper story about an elderly woman who lifted up the back of car to free her son trapped beneath: the jack had failed and the car was crushing him Somehow, she lifted that car, her feat defying belief. But that frail, old woman saved her son with strength she didn't know she had  until she needed it. Call it an adrenalin rush, call it what you will, but it happened.So, desperate situations do bring about desperate measures by people who don't appear to have the strength or will to accomplish a seemingly impossible feat. Until they're forced into action...At that level and that level alone, Unbreakable could have been a great movie, I think. But, because it skates on the edge of the paranormal, it loses some impact for me. Nevertheless, it's an excellent story, well acted and exquisitely directed by M. Night Shyamalan, famous for The Sixth Sense (1999).Don't get me wrong, however: I'm open to the concept of the paranormal because I've experienced things that can't be explained by rational means or knowledge. You may have also.This isn't the first film, however, to explore the idea of the super-man (let's put aside all comic book stuff, despite the heavy influence of comic books in Unbreakable): in 1968, a Frank M. Robinson novel, called The Power, was put to a film of the same name. It was heavily criticized, and yet it was a well produced rendition of an excellent sci-fi story: about an evil man with super, paranormal powers who stumbles upon a good man with identical powers. The ensuing battle for supremacy between the two made for great entertainment. And, as in Unbreakable, you don't know the identity of the evil man until close to the end. The key point with The Power, however, is that the good man didn't know he had the power  until he was tested to the point of death. And the twist at the end was irony at its best...Unbreakable takes up that idea of the super-man, where David Dunn (Bruce Willis), through a complex series of connected events, finally comes to realize that he is much more than other mortals.David is a security guard at a local university; but he used to be the brightest prospect in American football. Unhappily, he has a marriage that's all but dead: done in by years of sadness, discomfort, distrust and doubt. He is consumed with sadness, and not only because Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a comic book aficionado and art gallery owner, tells him that the saddest people are those who don't know why they're on this earth...Indeed, the happiest person is the one who knows his/her destiny, the reason for being. Hence slowly, but inexorably, David comes to the realization that his purpose on earth is to provide security for the oppressed, to help those who cannot help themselves, and to stop the path of evil, wherever and whenever. Thus emerges the closest yet to a modern-day superhero.As you will see, it's an unwelcome realization for David, at first. But he finally grasps that he is the defender of good; moreover, he discovers he has the strength and power to do it. And, in the climactic confrontation with a diabolical home invader, David proves it  to himself and to others. That knowledge for David has a price, however: Good can only exist  can only make sense  when Evil exists as a co-partner. And, therein lies the greatest irony for poor David.I loved this movie. It appeals to the heroic in all of us. It shows that evil can be countered effectively  and without the need for questionable vigilante exploits. Implicitly also, it suggests that the heroic is potentially within all of us, even the least because, given the right conditions, we could all be a 'frail, old woman' trying to save a son, a daughter or anybody from harm.The cinematography and editing are excellent. Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances, I think, equal to or better than In Country (1989); Robin Wright Penn, as Audrey, is suitably distraught and uncertain as his doubting wife; Spencer Clark, as David's son, Joseph, is a standout and very professional young actor. And what more needs to be said about Samuel L. Jackson  only that he is one of the most powerful actors ever to grace the silver screen.So, forget about any narrative holes you might see and the fact that the story moves very slowly. The tension and mystery mount inexorably, however. So, treat yourself and your family to a thoroughly enjoyable 106 minutes.",8,0,0,13 June 2008
Monster," A harrowing tale of a prostitute's life in hell.
","I'm puzzled why this story and film has the title it has. Properly defined, monster means, among other things, a person who generates horror through the commission of wicked or evil deeds. Hence, that title sounds misplaced, I think, when considering the actual life and times of the prostitute, Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron), who went about the Florida freeways killing her tricks, before being arrested in 1990. Granted, she did commit heinous crimes, but so did Ted Bundy and many other male serial killers who were much worse than anything Aileen did.According to the narrative, her first murder was in self-defense; the obnoxious and dangerous trick who picked her up was apparently intent on killing her. She found his gun and popped him, thus saving her own life. Aileen, however, was no sociopath, the true monsters in our societies; after the deed, she felt relief, anger, a touch of remorse and not a little fear of being caught. At that point, there was no thought of repeating her effort.A stronger personality and intelligence would have stopped there, taken stock of her situation, and decide to fade away as quickly and as far as possible. Unhappily for Aileen  and additional unsuspecting johns  she had neither the personality, nor intelligence nor money to change her mode of living: she'd been ground down since the age of thirteen and worked as a freeway hustler for years. Quite simply, the culture in which she lived helped to create and maintain the person she became...It's the oldest profession, of course, so I'm not saying that it wasn't her fault, especially the final heart-rending murder of an old guy (Scott Wilson) who just wanted to help her. Having seen her face, however, she had to kill him to survive and Theron's performance at this point is beyond comparison. I'd have given her the Oscar just for those few minutes. But, she was astounding throughout the entire film.Her unraveling begins, however, when she meets Selby (Christina Ricci) and the two become infatuated with each other, sexually and emotionally. Aileen, of course, has been loveless for most of her adult life, so the interest Selby shows in her is a new and exciting experience. So, when Aileen killed her first john in self-defense, she wanted to quit hooking and try to lead a normal life: get a real job, do it right, live with her new love in 'married' bliss. Hence, she tries: applying for all sorts of jobs for which she is totally unqualified. Her quest for respectability is totally crushed, however, when she's forced to return a favor to a corrupt cop.So, when she finally needed more money to feed herself, Selby and their life together, she took the easy way out: instead of getting paid for sex, she decided to kill the messenger. All of them. After the first murder, the second is always easier, so it is said. Hence, from that point on, she approaches, but doesn't encompass, the essence of the film's title.It's a sad story, of course, for many reasons. The saddest part, from my perspective, is that there are other Aileen Wuornoses out there, in just about every country in the world. And, it only needs a trigger to set another in motion again on a self-destructive and murderous path.It's a superb production, although somewhat hasty in its cuts and scene changes, I thought. However, it was shot over twenty-eight days, with multiple scenes on some days, so it must have been hectic trying to collapse the last nine months of Aileen's life on the road into just over a hundred minutes of film.Not recommended for children, of course. But recommended for all adults who aren't afraid to see the sordid face of all societies.",8,0,1,8 March 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Where Tarantino fantasizes about dirty war in war
","Okay – here's the story, in a paragraph: a bunch of American soldiers terrorize German infantry for years, in France, behind enemy lines. They become infamous to the Nazis, resorting to intense cruelty to the Germans. Even der Führer wants them caught. Meanwhile, in a French town, a lovely French-Jewish femme fatale plans to blow up her cinema when a famous German action flick is shown to the German hierarchy – including Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and Borman. Coincidentally, those infamous American soldiers are sent to do the same job. Also, there's a very nasty Nazi colonel who just loves to hunt down and kill Jews – and he smells a rat in the House of Cinema. How it all turns out, I'll leave up to you to discover – that is, if you see this film.But, I don't recommend at all. Let me tell you why.First, it's billed as drama/thriller/war. Well, I guess it does contain all of those attributes, but they forgot about fantasy. Because, this story is, at core, a spoof about war and sheer fantasy, in addition.Second, in its effort to establish and develop character, it's often boring because it's way too talky for a thriller; you see character from what people do, not from what they say. Brad Pitt (as Aldo Raine) is okay as an over-the-top parody of hill-billy Americana – and he does it well. But, even his character becomes too talky. The nasty Nazi, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is talky also, but at least he's a detective (in his own words), so he has to ask a lot of questions. The rest of the cast do their best with a script that varies between intense dread, only occasionally, to high camp, often – especially concerning the German hierarchy.Third, the whole story is preposterous. Let's face it – any war story that purports to show the entire German hierarchy being blown up in a cinema can only be regarded as coming from another planet Earth in another universe. And the (way too long) card game scene in the café basement is screechingly contrived coincidence and just too stupid for words. So, if you do see it, leave believability (the prime requirement for good stories, especially war) at the door. You've been warned.And, finally, although Quentin Tarantino started well with his filmic revelation, Reservoir Dogs (1992), and followed up with his much better Elmore Leonard story, Jackie Brown (1997) – his best to date – this one is his nadir, in my opinion. Technically very good, especially with the editing, this basterd of a story nevertheless kills the whole experience. If he was trying to show war in the raw, look no further than the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line (1998). If he was trying to create a thriller, stay with the Bourne franchise. If he was attempting drama in war, watch From Here to Eternity (1953) or Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and too many other superior films.To be fair, it has its moments: the frenetic shootout in the café basement is editing at its best. And the opening scenes at the French farm are a tour de force in building dread. However, the cardboard cutout characters left me totally indifferent to the fate of any of them: in sum, a dead story about death at its worst. It'll be interesting to see if Christoph Waltz gets the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Miracles do happen, though.I note that Roger Ebert gave it four stars. Is that out of ten? I hope so – I give it four also.Oh, heck, see it if you must, but just keep in mind it's a fantastic spoof.",4,12,20,18 February 2010
Cloverfield," How bad is bad? Watch this and find out
","There are two things going for this movie: first, it's shot so darkly (with a hand-held camera), you can't see much the stupid antics of the characters in this so-called story. And, second, it ends after seventy-one excruciatingly boring minutes. And, not a minute too soon...If you're into excessive use of CGI and special effects, then by all means see it.If you're looking for a rip-off from maybe a dozen other movies e.g. The Thing (1982), The Blair Witch Project (1999), Predator (1987), Alien (1979), Godzilla (1998), King Kong (1933, 1976, 2005) etc etc, then, by all means do go and see it.As a metaphor for the tragedy of 9/11, however, it just stinks. Shame on the whole production cast for making this piece of trash.On the other hand, I give it points for those special effects, the CGI (albeit excessive) and the frenetic editing (which is still often annoying). And, I give the (forgettable) actors a point for having the moxie to actually appear in this pile o'sh**t.Not recommended for (real) kids or serious movie-goers.And, look, if you want a much better non-stop action/terror flick, using hand-held camera, see REC(2007) – but, only the Spanish version.",4,2,6,26 January 2010
Crash," A day in the lives  and deaths  of LA citizens...
","As Paul Newman said in Cool Hand Luke (1967), just before his character was killed off, 'What we've got here is failure to communicate...'You could say that is THE theme of this well-crafted drama of life in La-La Land. And, yet, as you follow the lives of six or seven disparate couples, and how many interact during the course of thirty-six hours, the writer/director, Paul Haggis, brings a true sense of what it means to communicate, for good and for evil, and how what is said doesn't always mean what is said. Human communication is complex, and all too often, too many factors get in the way to proper listening -- really listening to what somebody is trying to tell you...Aye, there's the rub, as the bard once said.So, there is no main story  there are many different vignettes, many of which directly crisscross  or crash into  each other, however fleetingly. And, as the viewer, you see just what happens when two or more people fail to understand the significance of what they see, what has happened, and what they think they know. The twists and turns are delicious (I'm not talking about driving, okay) and there are some surprise moments that just might take your breath away... (The whole narrative is way too episodic to convey in words, in a review such as this; I could write 5000 words on this film, but that would bore you.)So, that's another theme: nothing is ever as it seems. There's always something more, something that might be hidden, unknown, unrealized. Hence, the consequences of getting things wrong are all too well played out by the great cast: gritty in its realism, shocking in the results, and all too true to life...Of special mention is the stark contrast between the racist cop, John Ryan (Matt Dillon), and the new, idealistic recruit, Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillipe) as they work through their differences on the job. At first, it seems that Ryan has no redeeming qualities, so much so that the young Hansen manages to get reassigned, away from Ryan, after lodging a complaint about him for harassing a black couple. And yet, Ryan provides one of the most traumatically uplifting moments in the whole movie with a selfless  and hugely ironic  act of heroic bravery, while his ex-partner Hansen  flushed with his own self-importance  comes face to face with his own fundamental inadequacy, as a human being, in the worst possible way. But it's all just another day on the job...Some critics might say that too much of the narrative depended upon coincidence. But life is chaotic, the universe thrives on it at all levels, and we all know that strange coincidences have happened to each of us. You wouldn't believe some that have happened to me, driving around the city I live in. Or, maybe you would?Don Cheadle, as detective Graham Waters, is the one character that the camera follows the most. So, on that basis, I would say it's mostly about him, seeing as how the film starts and (almost) ends with him on the screen. In actual fact, however, Paul Haggis remains true to good narrative sense and starts and ends the film with similar events, in this case, a collision between two cars. These days, what better icon for a city is there, anyway?Haggis has written and directed a film that owes much to Robert Altman, I think. Those who know the latter's work would tend to see that influence here also. As I loved most of Altman's movies, I found this one just as satisfying, if perhaps a little more jerky at the cuts and scene changes. But, I'm not complaining: this is movie making at its best, with a haunting soundtrack, and if you haven't seen and heard it, then I'd urge you to do so.It's quite violent in parts, there are sex scenes, but all of it is in context; nothing in this narrative is gratuitous. It's how cities are -- it's how they are...",9,4,16,15 January 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Where fantasy provides justification for reality
","I dislike fantasies, particularly modern versions. As a child, I saw many; and, as a child, I enjoyed them. There comes a time, however, when you must grow up to face reality. Or try to as Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) says in the story.I knew nothing of Pan's Labyrinth (PL), and even less of the director, del Toro, before I finally decided to see it – on the recommendation of a trusted friend. Up front, I'll say this: technically and visually, it's quite stunning and worth seeing for those aspects alone. It probably deserved the awards received for those aspects (not sure that I would have applauded for the putative twenty minutes at Cannes, however). On top of that, the period setting, the music, the special effects and acting are all up to par.But this film is not for children.--- (IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, THEN READ NO FURTHER – MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW)--- Where the film seems to fail, for many viewers here, is in the narrative and plot. From my perspective, however, I think it succeeds for two reasons: first, all good narratives should achieve a thematic balance by foreshadowing the end of the story at the beginning. In that regards, PL opens with the young protagonist, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), mortally wounded, on the ground, looking at the viewer; as the story ends, the film brings the viewer back to that same scene.With the opening scene, as the camera slowly zooms in to Ofelia's eyeball, the viewer sees blood – that had been flowing from her nose – magically defy gravity and flow backwards: the viewer is now going back in time.And so, the plot begins...From that point, until the final scene, the viewer is inside Ofelia's mind: all that follows are the last thoughts of Ofelia before she dies, exemplifying the idea that, at the point of death, one's life flashes through your mind.Ofelia, however, mixes the fantasy of her own collection of fairy tales with the realities of the cruel world of Fascist Spain and thus brings the viewer on an allegorical and magical mystery tour of the circumstances that result in her heroism when facing and defeating evil – in the form of Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), her step-father – and her own death at his very hands. So, to that extent, the two worlds of reality and fantasy are in perfect accord (excluding some narrative inconsistencies – too long and complex to discuss here).So, why does Ofelia review only the last few hours of her short life? In my opinion, as a child victim of war, she's coming to terms with the choices she's made that result in her own death while saving her new-born half-brother from the dictates of her monstrous step-father. Children are always the biggest losers in war and Ofelia makes the biggest sacrifice by choosing to die to save a baby.Structuring the story around the idea of 'life flashing before your eyes when dying' has been done already in such diverse films as Donnie Darko (2001), Mulholland Drive (2001), Jacob's Ladder (1990) and others. For PL, it's the only narrative device that makes sense to this viewer and helps to resolve the apparent narrative discord in this film, between reality and fantasy, noted by many reviewers.Having now seen PL, I'm glad I did, because it's a finely crafted story grounded in reality, and especially in the reality of fantasy, without which our common humanity would be much poorer. Having said that, I'll still avoid pure fantasy in film.And finally, although I don't rate the film as highly as most do, I do recommend it – including the extreme violence – for all interested adults.",7,0,6,15 January 2010
Battleship Potemkin," Where a social revolution and cinematic revolution merged.
","A study in heroics. A call to violent revolution. A propaganda piece. A work of homo erotic art. A story for the ages. A commercial success only in the west....Sergei Eisenstein's first full-length feature is all of those. It's also the movie that brought his name to international audiences, forever. Arguably, few movie directors reach that pinnacle of fame so early in life - Eisenstein being only twenty-seven when Battleship Potemkin (BP) was released. Such is artistic genius.The story, largely based upon the actual facts of history, follows no single protagonist; for Eisenstein, the working class is paramount, represented by the sailors and the people of Odessa. The visual narrative shows the sailors taking over the ship, steaming on to Odessa, gaining the support of the local population and finally venturing forth to sea again to meet the Tsar's opposing naval forces who, against the odds, did not fire a single shot in anger, allowing BP to pass through the cordon to freedom. The mutineers had won, a metaphor so strong that, at a later time, Lenin called the entire incident 'a dress rehearsal' for the 1917 revolution. On the other hand, although some of the local Odessa population were in fact killed by Tsarist troops, the massacre on the Odessa steps - a seven minute, seminal montage of exquisite action forever copied by others - was entirely Eisenstein's fiction. Moreover, the mutineers did not truly win: after sailing through the opposing fleet, BP was eventually retaken by Russian authorities at a Romanian port on the Black Sea. Other minor aspects of the story were also changed to suit Eisenstein's creative inspirations. Good storytellers, though, never let facts hinder creativity.Of greater visual importance, I think, is the long, slow sequence of thousands of local people descending to the dockyards to file past the body of Vakulinchuk (Antonov), the valiant leader of the mutineers, who was shot to death by one of the officers. Regardless of how many turned out in reality, Eisenstein's cameras capture the mood and reality of those times with a mix of sharp, extreme close- ups and long shots of staggering complexity and a cast of thousands.I saw this movie first in 1968 or 69. Forty-five years have not dimmed the imagery I recall so vividly when I saw it again recently. It's that sort of movie. Along with Strike (1925) made soon after BP, these are cinematic icons you cannot afford to miss, especially if you consider yourself a movie aficionado. No movie ever gets a ten from this reviewer. If I could give this 9.9, I would, however. Recommended for all.April 5th, 2015.",9,1,1,5 April 2015
Lost in Translation," As the saying goes, better the devil you know than the one you know not...
","I was reluctant to see this film simply because I did not like Sofia Coppola's prior work that she directed and which I'd seen on TV (it was a forgettable TV flick about teenage suicides).However, as a big fan of Bill Murray, I finally put aside my prejudice about Sofia Coppola as a director, and sat down to watch it one evening recently.I'd read a couple of film reviews in newspapers, so I had a fair idea about the story. Or, so I thought... Yes, the bald outline is about a middle-aged actor (Bill Murray) in Japan to do some Japanese commercials, and it is about how he meets a somewhat neglected wife of a professional photographer, and then how the two spend time together enjoying the sights and sounds of Tokyo...and, ultimately, the sight and sound of each other.So, as a story, it's really simple: a week out of two people's lives who meet by chance and who probably will never meet again. But, as the song goes, the memory lingers on...Hence, this is not a romance. Instead, this story is a romance that might have been, or still might be. We'll never know  and that's the real romance and power of this narrative, because it's the sort of thing that can happen to any of us as we wander through life's trials and tribulations.As Bob Harris, Bill Murray is just perfect in the role; even when he is serious, he can be very funny. Scarlett Johansson, as Charlotte, whom I'd seen a few months back in Match Point (2005), Woody Allen's suspense thriller, is refreshingly plain, and portrays the waiting wife with studied skill. The rest of the cast, although necessary, is barely evident throughout the movie: nearly all of the camera work focuses on the two almost-and-if-not-for-other-commitments-might-have-been lovers. So, there is a slow build-up, as the two get to know each other casually, and then eventually learn how to reveal some of their innermost thoughts and feelings to each other. In fact, the first hour is very slow, and, once or twice, during that time, my resolve to see it through to the end nearly went. So, I'm glad I ignored my impatience...Sofia Coppola's theme is thus well played out between the two: life is chaotic and chance encounters can lead to big and better things; but, only if you have the courage of your convictions. That is, if you are prepared to pay the price, whatever that is. An excellent near parallel is David Lean's Brief Encounter (1945) with Trevor Howard and Cecelia Johnson that, if you haven't seen, is worth the time to see. Having said that, it would spoil this story to say any more about how this film ends.But, I'll finish by saying that I was impressed by Coppola's direction this time round, and I do recommend this film as a thoughtful and thought-provoking slice of life that could be yours, or mine, any day of the week.",8,1,2,4 January 2007
Interstellar," Where physics takes a death spiral through a giant narrative blackhole
","If you deplore negative reviews of movies featuring your favorite director or actor, read no further. Okay, then ... I like science-fiction stories and movies, provided they both stick to the categorical facts and maxims of physics and quantum mechanics. Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001:A Space Odyssey (1967), in the main, is the quintessential example which sticks to those requirements. But if a story, such as this Interstellar, allows itself to fall into outrageous speculation, then it's not science: it's simple fantasy. Hence, in this movie, fiction is truly stranger than basic truth. Although it does have it's interesting moments....For example, the settings and special effects are simply outstanding; the artwork and CGI are also standout features. The acting, at times, is excellent, especially from McConaughey, Hathaway and Chastain. The supporting cast is generally up to par; and it was a pleasant surprise to briefly see William Devane once again - as an aging nasty, again. The best actors, for my money though, are the robots: TARS and the sort-of-eponymous CASE - both not only highly innovative and imaginative in form and behaviour, but also the best humour in the whole movie (of which there is very little).Regarding the physics aspect, the one thing the writers almost got right (about relativity and time dilation) was a well presented and excellent visual statement when Cooper (McConaughey) finally meets his grown-up daughter, Murph (Chastain). However, the remainder of the dialogue centering upon space travel, worm holes, black holes, gravity, time travel and so on is just full of ... well, holes. And, downright misinformation. Aaah, but it all sounds so cool....While I fully understand why it has a high (but undeserved) score, other inferior movies - The Abyss (1989), Close Encounters (1977), Titanic (1997) - achieve similar levels of approval. Still, this story is well structured without being unduly confusing. Direction, photography and editing are well up to Nolan standard of excellence, as you would expect. The sound track, however, is a tad loud for my liking; and, overall, the pacing is too slow and the overall length too long. Finally, as to the story itself - our dying planet, our need to survive, what can we do? - well, it's topical, important and now, an increasingly urgent issue. But this movie, deliberately or unintentionally, subverts viewers with its blatantly, saccharine banality that: Love conquers all. Meh! To nail things in perspective, this is not nearly as entertaining or imaginative as Inception, even though that one also classed itself wrongly as sci-fi. Overall, Interstellar is a movie only worth seeing if you have around three hours you don't mind using up, for better or worse. Give it four out of ten.

The Bourne Ultimatum," Where we are frenetically borne along with Jason once again
","There's two thing's going for this latest chapter in the Bourne saga: it has one of best fight scenes ever filmed, between Bourne (Matt Damon) and Desh Boukansi (Joey Ansah) within the confined spaces of a cramped apartment in Tangiers. As a martial artist myself, I know just how easy it is to get hurt, even when playing around  so, the time taking to choreograph that whole sequence must have been meticulous and lengthy. It's worth seeing this film for that alone.The other thing in its favour is the spectacular chase sequence in New York City with Bourne in a stolen NYPD cruiser being hunted down by a succession of CIA agents all intent on the shoot-to-kill order from the Top Bad Guy Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Just how much damage can a cruiser take? Be amazed and awed as you watch  particularly a very clever action shot as mangled cars zoom completely over cameras (which must have been two fixed and remotely operated units) positioned directly in the line of crash. And, prior to that sequence, we see Bourne take a flying leap backwards, in a car, from the top of a car park, to land onto... Ah, ha  you thought I was going to say 'water' or 'balloons', or such like. See the movie...And then wonder just how a superhuman like Bourne can survive so many potentially fatal situations. This guy is totally, I mean, totally unbreakable. Oooops, sorry, that's been done already by Bruce Willis in Unbreakable (2000).Well, then, try to understand how a guy can be fluent in so many languages, apparently so quickly: Russian, German, French, Spanish, Italian and who knows what else, while still trying to find out who he is. I guess he's been around a lot...Which must be true, because he seems to know every little alley, street corner kiosk, parking lot, train station layout, and a plethora of other aspects about just about every major city in the northern hemisphere. And, that in turn means this Bourne guy must be loaded with an inexhaustible supply of money and/or credit cards to which he has constant access...from where and from whom?And, he never sleeps. Even when traveling...The thing that stops this movie from descending into comic book chaos is the presence of director Greengrass and the quality of the production. It's very well made, as a film; the editing is sharp, quick (almost too quick sometimes) but ferociously exciting. So much so, while the fight scenes are very good, I'm sure there's cranked up speed to parts that are done at a more leisurely pace.The story is merely a continuation of Bourne's need to uncover his past. Which he does, by the time the credits start to roll  leaving open, of course, another sequel.I just all hope it's not called Bourne Again. Recommended.",7,3,6,29 December 2007
The Thing," What to do, when you can't escape or trust anybody?
","First time round, in 1982, this was a scary movie. Having seen it again, recently, it's not as scary as, say, Hallloween (1978), Alien (1979) and others. More importantly, nearly thirty years later, it's now much easier for me to spot the shortcomings of the narrative.But, I'll ignore those so as not to spoil the story which I first saw in the 1951 version (largely produced by Howard Hawks). For its time, that also was a scary movie (for a ten year old) which also served as a political metaphor about the dangers of the Soviet Union and communism. This 1982 version, however, avoids that trap by eliminating all of the military aspects so prevalent in the earlier version.Essentially, the story follows the book written by John Campbell quite well (unlike the 1951 production), showing how a particularly vicious alien attempts to take over and literally absorb – into itself – the scientists and support personnel at an American Antarctic base station. In a series of graphically violent situations, we see how the alien infiltrates and, when finding one of the humans alone, attacks, envelops and eventually takes on the physical appearance of its victims.Hence, creeping paranoia and mutual distrust invade the humans. And, very cleverly, the script and direction make sure that, as viewers, we can never be entirely certain about the true identity of each character as the story reaches its inevitable conclusion – and, by implication, beyond.The special alien effects are still worthy of special mention, particularly as it was all done without any help from CGI. The early scene in the dog pen, when we first see the nasty beast, can never be forgotten, I think; the destroyed Norwegian base camp is suitably spooky and scary; and the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) conducts his own blood tests to weed out the good humans from the bad ones is a tour de force in suspense. Added to all of that is Ennio Morricone's brooding, throbbing, menacing sound track – pervasively shadowing the action, its beat emphasizing the time ticking away as the desperate men battle each other and the alien.Arguably, this is equally a movie about terror as much as horror: the terror of the malevolent unknown, and the horror of one's fellow man taking on the guise of that malevolence. To cap it all, there is no escape, even for the survivors – who may or may not be human anyway. Make your own assessment if you see this movie from John Carpenter, one of the true masters of terror and horror.Recommended for all lovers of sci-fi who like to be scared witless.",7,2,6,6 March 2010
Cold Mountain," More like Dullsville.
","This is probably my shortest ever review for any film.There is one spectacular battle at the start: grim, grimy and grueling and showing what war means: death all around. Technically well done, but nothing new. Quite a few war films in the last twenty years showed it equally well, or better: Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987), The Thin Red Line (1998). Whew, even Gone With The Wind (1939) is a far better story.This movie is death to the senses, however, because it's what you can get when you mix genres: is it a love story during war or is it a war story that shows love is still possible? Either way, it's a dull, dull, dull story. The characters are dull, and the acting is dull. Which is all quite surprising from the late director of The English Patient (1996), a much superior film and story, in my opinion. Just proves, however, that you need a good story before you can make a good movie, especially when set during wartime. Cold Mountain, however, reminded me of the tedium of another war movie, Battle Cry (1955). And for a more credible love story set in war, see From Here To Eternity (1953)So, don't bother to see the rest of Cold Mountain after that first battle, unless you like long flashbacks, long interludes and voice-overs that serve merely to send you to sleep.In fact, I don't even recommend seeing it, even the first big battle. It's just not worth your time.",3,3,7,28 October 2006
American Psycho," Beware of what you wish for  you might just get it!
","This is a finely constructed allegory for all that is dark and horrible about the excesses of modernity, as epitomized by a yuppie stockbroker, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as he descends into his insanity.You see, Patrick doesn't exist in reality: he only exists, in the minds of others, as a cardboard cutout  much like his exquisite business card that doesn't quite cut it when compared to his friends'  who occupies a vacuous space in his vacuous office where he goes through the vacuous motions of doing vacuous business in a vacuous world...And, all the while, Patrick's frustrations, doubts, self-loathing and contempt for the world all mix together in his mind to produce the only outlet he can generate: supreme anger at a system that must be cleansed, and violently.So, he goes on a secret killing spree  removing office competitors, prostitutes, drunks, deadbeats, ex-lovers and whoever else takes his fancy. Precisely clinical in his office at work, at the bar with his friends, or at dinner with his fiancée or lover, Patrick executes  the very operative word  all those dregs of society with the same dispassionate disdain that he holds for the world in general.Bale is simply superb in this role, one that must have been very difficult to portray; little wonder that he was nominated for a good number of awards (he won a Best Actor award). Kudos (and awards!) also goes to the scriptwriters, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner, for a clever and witty narrative. I've not read the book, but now I think I should, despite all the bad press from long ago.Yes, this is a horror story; but the horror is not in the violence that, for the most part and when compared to other films, is muted. The real horror is that which occurs in Patrick's psyche, as he tries to sort out the fictions of the real world from the reality of his fictional and insane world. Hence, as a viewer, it's often difficult to sort out those things also...which is perhaps the major sub-text of this story when applied to the world in which we all live, whatever our worlds are. Sure, the story is over-the-top, but it's a satire as well as an allegorical tour-de-force; so, treat it as such.It's not for every body, that's for sure, and certainly not for adolescents. As adults, however, we should all welcome a narrative such as this, to allow our own mind to dwell upon the issues raised, which are many as well as varied. For example, how often have I said to somebody, in jest: 'Don't do that, or I'll kill you'? This story examines that type of behavioral idea - with a vengeance.The production is slick, as it should be on Wall Street, glitzy restaurants and sumptuous surrounds; the supporting cast is equal to Bale's performance, but there's no doubt he dominates, as he should in this role; and it was great to listen to some good oldies from Phil Collins and others.Highly recommended for adults who aren't afraid to look within this narrative...and perhaps within themselves.",8,1,2,12 December 2007
The Shining," Whoever said horror only happens when it's dark?
","I saw this film in 1981 and, just recently, decided to see it again before I wrote a review.Time hasn't diminished the effect: this is still a scary movie from one of the industry's greatest directors.After seeing it for the first time, I sourced Stephen King's novel and sat down to have good read. Boy, was that a mistake? I gave up trying to read King's dense narrative that seemed to be all over the place, leaving it aside so that I could remember the effectiveness of Kubrick's screenplay. Only much later, did I learn that Kubrick's script deviated markedly from King's novel. Well, I guess that's art...There are many striking features about the film. First, who would expect to see a true horror movie shot mostly in bright daylight and at such an idyllic setting? Quite the opposite to all the Dracula type schlock that had been so common and that graced cinema screens up till then. Recall Psycho from 1960... The effect for me was to make the narrative all the more horrifying.Did I say idyllic setting? More like modern Gothic, in a way. Or maybe Kubrick was subtlety poking fun at prior so-called horror flicks that had the inevitable dark castle sitting on hill, with lightning crashing around most of the time?And then there's Jack Nicholson, one of Tinsel Town's eccentrics, if not crazy, playing a role tailor made for him. How could it not be, after seeing how well he did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)? Some might argue he was over the top, a caricature almost, of a man who truly goes insane. Watching him for the second time, however, I think his performance reminded me all too well of insane people I've met in real life.As a study in abnormal psychology, I think it works very well  in fact, it's a tour de force. And that's why I'm still also a mite disappointed by the way the narrative turns to use supernatural elements to explain the reasons for Jack's descent into his private Hell. (I suppose I'll have to read King's novel to sort this out.) I'm prepared to accept the idea of telepathy between young Danny (Danny Lloyd) and Dick (Scatman Crothers) because I've come across situations that strongly suggest its probability. I see no need, however, to introduce the supernatural, except to appeal to the gullible.Shelley Duval is well cast as the already nervous wife, Wendy; and, I read that Kubrick made her even more nervous with his need for perfection. Scatman was suitably impressive and mysterious; a fine actor and composer. And, hats off to young Danny Lloyd.If this is a movie you've missed, I recommend it thoroughly.",8,9,14,15 November 2007
Warrior," What occurs when Rocky Redux doubles down
","Don't get me wrong: this is a well-produced and well-acted story that has all the fighting elements you'd want in a film that includes brutal, knock-down MMA.Trouble is, the actual story – boxer who wins big against the odds – has been done quite a few times already, Rocky (1976) being arguably the most remembered example. Hence, from that perspective, there is not much to say about this one. The synopsis on the main page provides sufficient as a starting point for most viewers' needs, anyway.In my view (no pun intended), what's more interesting is the performances from Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy – coupled, of course, with the poignant portrayal of failed father and reformed drunkard from Nick Nolte.Edgerton is simply amazing. Having seen him previously in Animal Kingdom (2010) and The Square (2008), with his bearded, heavy-set and even over-weight physique, it's clear he trained hard to reduce his weight for this film. The intensity of his aggressive acting has just got better though. Hardy tops Edgerton, however: he is just awesome and reminiscent of a young Marlon Brando. Never have I seen an actor 'get into' a role as he did here. With his portrayal as the guilt-ridden ex-Marine wanting punishment for his sins, he forced me to sit up and take notice of who this guy is. I found out I'd seen him in Black Hawk Down (2001) – but completely missed him – and recently in Inception (2010); but I didn't see his potential then.Nolte, with his bloated face, his aging, pudgy body and saddened features is perfectly cast as the drunk he once was (in acting and in real life). He's a good choice as the externally gruff wife-beater who finally wakes up to what he's done to his family and himself. The reconciliation scene as Hardy hugs Nolte on the bed in the hotel is one of the best father/son scenes ever put to film, I think.The supporting cast – including some real-life MMA tough guys – is uniformly good. Photography and editing are well up to the mark. The pacing slows somewhat with the various sub-plots but not to the point of me wanting to leave the room. My only other beef is that the dialog is difficult to hear many times, either because of external noise or low vocals, or both.If you liked Rocky as a story then this updated version is worth two hours of your life – even if you can't abide those 'animals' in the MMA cage. The two main actors certainly earned their fees for this one, both sustaining injuries while filming. As a martial artist myself, I know the drill.Recommended, mostly, for all MMA freaks and boxing fans. Give it seven.June 6, 2012.",7,0,2,6 June 2012
Salt," Where Salt gives a new perspective on bitter-sweet victory
","In the manner of other action spy dramas (see the Bourne franchise, for example, or the interminable Bond series etc), this outing is simply another vehicle for another (unlikely) action heroine, Evelyn Salt (Jolie), who demonstrates her ability to foil all attempts to keep her locked down, in chains, tied up, handcuffed or imprisoned â€“ so that she can 'save the world', as one of the key characters remarks towards the end of this frenetically paced, kick-butt, auto mangling, wall breaking, truck smashing and totally improbable plot. Still, it's exciting with some truly imaginative stunts to help take your breath away.Accompanying Jolie, we see her concerned boss, Ted Winter (Schreiber), Peabody (Ejiofor) â€“ all CIA agents â€“ Salt's husband, Krause (Diel), and Orlov (Olbrychiski), a Russian spy who sets the ball rolling when he surrenders to the CIA. Naturally, in this sort of caper, nothing is ever as it seems. So, keep the sound up when they're talking to keep up with the clues and plot twists. The most I'll say is that it's different; but it has similar convoluted excesses as, say, The Manchurian Candidate (1962, 2004) and the B and B series.Jolie is credibly tough, Schreiber is suitably urbane, Ejiofor cannily persistent, Diel naively supportive and the Russians are, wellÂ…stereotypically Russian. In other words, the acting fits the scenes (no pun intended). As you might expect, the editing is superb throughout. The direction by Noyce is precise and allows the story to unfold without too much thinking; just go with it.But why Salt â€“ why that name? Well, during the Cold War, the USA and USSR actually held a series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks â€“ aka SALT I. Those talks morphed, later, into SALT II.I guess Evelyn Salt decided there'd been enough talking already: time for action. So, we might see Salt II down the road where she finishes the job.Give this six out of ten, mainly for action, photography and editing. Recommended for action fans only.January 25, 2014",6,2,3,25 January 2014
Apocalypse Now," As somebody said: 'We've seen the enemy, and they is us!'
","I saw AN soon after it was first released. Years later, I forget when, I saw Coppola's documentary about the making of AN. That helped to clear up, for me, some of the very odd jump shifts and cuts that were obvious in the first release of this epic story about...well, I'll get to that below.First, however, I'll say a word (or few) about the original novella  Heart of Darkness - from Joseph Conrad. Written in the style of Conrad's times  a series of nested first and third person narratives - it's not mainstream for sure. In fact, most of today's reading audience would not read it, I think. Moreover, the whole narrative is a bit of a chore to follow (it's many years since I read it). Conrad, however, wasn't interested in entertaining per se; he was more interested in asking fundamental questions about the human condition and this story went to the heart of the matter: what drives people to do terrible things?That, in a nutshell, is what AN is all about; and, in this film, you see many people do terrible things. The fact that Coppola dressed up Conrad's central question within a fictional episode of the Vietnam War served two purposes: it brought Conrad's thesis into the mainstream and also allowed Coppola to make his own philosophical statement about the Vietnam War. Well, by all accounts, he certainly succeeded in both objectives. The phrase 'heart of darkness' is bandied about now so often, I'm sure most would know where they first saw it; and that wouldn't have been while reading Conrad, I reckon. Moreover, in all probability, the narrative Coppola constructed around Conrad's question will stand as the definitive criticism about war in general, and the Vietnam War in particular.And I say that in full recognition of the other fine directors (Milestone, Fuller, Malick, Kubrick, Eastwood etc) who have given us great war movies that also stand as classics.With the possible exception of Kubrick's Dr Strangelove (1964)  that savage, comedic satire about the Cold War  AN is, I think, the very best satire about war. But, it's not a comedy, although one might be forgiven for laughing at Colonel Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) antics when attacking the Vietcong village, attempting surfboarding during battle, BBQing on the beach, or loving the smell of napalm or 'victory', to use the Colonel's word. And not to be missed is Captain Willard's (Martin Sheen, in his best work) coming ashore to met by none other than Coppola portraying a gung-ho documentary producer/director who keeps shouting, 'Don't look at the camera, keep going, keep going, don't look at us, look like you're fighting, keep going...' And, all the while, the mortar rounds crump in the distance, the Hueys thump-thump-thump on by, and the people screaming for help go unheard.The satire continues as Capt. Willard is carried up river aboard a Navy patrol boat towards Cambodia where he must assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), the officer whose methods, according to top brass, are 'unsound'  a euphemism for 'crazy'. Along the way, the crew of the boat and Willard first encounter some jungle jollies for the grunts  a Bunny show, staged at a supply depot on the river that, of course, gets completely out of hand as sex-starved soldiers attempt to get their lusts satisfied. The mute Vietnamese people  outsiders in their own land  watch through chain-link fencing with big eyes and must wonder at the crazed antics of the Americans. Grinning ruefully and shaking his head, Willard gets the boat going again, up river...Further up, they encounter an all but destroyed Medic unit, mired in mud from incessant rain, and mired in lust from incessant sex with live-in Bunnies, there as 'treatment' for broken bodies and minds. Well, thinks Willard, no doubt: what else is there to do in this crazy and God-forsaken place? Trading some fuel for sex for the crew seemed like a good idea at the time. After which they again carry on up river...And are stopped by some bizarre French colonialists who are mired in past glories of French colonial conquests and defeats. In a bizarre dinner, Willard is subjected to vitriolic abuse, from some at the table, about the stupidity of the American efforts in Asia and Vietnam in particular. However: there they are  the stupid French  still arguing about the merits of Dien Bien Phu and the French defeat  or victory, depending on your point of view. And, after bedding one of the women, Roxanne (Aurore Clement), Willard continues with his quest...Which, as he gets closer, he realizes is not what it seems to be. However, it is when he meets Kurtz that his odyssey ends - or so he thinks. Because along that tortuous river, Willard has explored, via voice-over narration, the tortuous machinations of the rationale for and against the bloody conflict in which he had been mired in for years and finally comes to realize that, in the final analysis, he and Kurtz are kindred spirits. Weeks before, the brass had said to Willard: 'Cut the head off the snake, and the body dies.' And so, Willard completes his mission  physically and, most importantly, symbolically as he cuts power off the radio to air strike operations, thus keeping his location hidden.Thankfully, the Redux version includes footage that fleshes out the interplay between Willard and Kurtz, so that when the denouement arrives, the reasons for Willard's final decisions are completely rational within the irrational world of war.For me, the ending of the cinema version never made sense, psychologically or militarily; but, that's studio bosses getting their way, I suppose. The Redux version says it all. It's long (220+ minutes), but I didn't get up even once to get a drink of water.Highest recommendation for all mature adults.",9,1,2,6 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," Where we learn why some young folk just don't know their limitations....
","There are probably no film-makers to match the Coen brothers with regard to the crime/thriller genre. From the seminal Blood Simple (1984), on to Miller's Crossing (1990), thence to the chilling Fargo (1996) and now, finally, what must be viewed as a masterpiece of cinematography, editing and storytelling. They've done quirky comedies and dramas along the way, but, for my money, nobody beats these brothers when it comes to thrillers that are also horrific.A good story is a prime requirement, of course: score ten-for-ten, straight up. Then the characters: down-to-earth Texans and Mexicans, tough as nails, the good and the horrifically bad. They're all there in a cast that meshes beautifully to produce a relentless pursuit across the flat, almost featureless, quasi-moonscape of the Texas deserts and low-down border towns.As the fade-in begins, there is the voice-over by Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) as the camera pans across the ochre plains and rocky outcrops, and you might think how appropriate the title is. You're right, but it's more than that, of course, being a metaphor for the times: a society almost ruined by drug-running, incessant murders and killings, and the mindless pursuit of money. This is the over-arching theme with which the Coens ring out the tragedy that unfolds as Sheriff Bell tries to catch up with Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who's got two million dollars of dirty money that the bad guys are trying to find.In a few words, here's the basic story: Moss finds two million at the site of a drug gang battle in the Texas desert. He takes the money and runs. Unknown to him, a sociopathic hit man, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is hot on his trail to recover the money and kill Moss. At the same time, Sheriff Bell is hot on the trail of Chigurh, who's left a series of dead victims along the highways and byways. So, Moss sends his wife, Carla (Kelly Macdonald), away to El Paso (with her mother) for safety reasons, and so that he can contend with the killer on his trail. And, none of them know that members of the Mexican drug gang are following Carla, hoping she'll eventually lead them to Moss.Essentially, however, it's a story about the contest between Moss and Chigurh: the former, a Vietnam vet who trained to kill; the latter, one of society's nightmares who simply kills - on a whim, on the toss of a coin, and on principle. Bardem's performance is calmly devastating: never raising his voice, never displaying anger, never showing mercy. And professional to his very core. The most disturbing scene is his encounter, early in the plot, with an old clerk at a country gas station who inadvertently annoys Chigurh with an inane but innocuous question. Watching and hearing that exchange of words reveals everything you don't want to know about Chigurh and his penchant for killing.So, while the basic story (drug gangs, gun battles, innocent victims, good guy-bad guy) has been done before, many times, it's the character driven nature of this story that makes it into a riveting thriller, helped along by the Coen brothers' expertise with camera, script, editing and sound. On that last point, this film is noteworthy with the almost complete absence of a musical score, an aspect that heightened the suspense - because, as the viewer, you're able to hear more easily the far-off sound of ominous steps in a corridor, characters breathing, the snick of a gun being cocked, and so on.Most stories in film and literature end unambiguously. However, the final scenes between Bell, Ellis (Barry Corbin), the old-time deputy, and Bell's wife, Loretta (Tess Harper) seem to be completely at odds with the main narrative, to the extent that some viewers have been annoyed/infuriated with the apparent lack of closure, according to some reports I've seen. I'll say this much: from one perspective, there's a nod to the ending of Point Blank (1967); from another perspective, one must remember that stories are constructed and, therefore, are open to interpretation by the viewer. I have an interpretation that brings full closure for me. It's up to you to develop yours.Thoroughly recommended, but for adults only. Has gruesome, bloody violence and a killer (Chigurh) with the kinkiest weapon yet put to film. Like I said, ten out of ten.

District 9," A fantastic allegory – and an allegorical fantasy.
","Imagine an alien inter-galactic space ship arriving above one of the major cities of the world. Wait – that was already done in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). There's nothing like sticking to a good formula, though...In this story, however, the world doesn't stand still; instead, the space ship does, hovering, blocking out the sun over a major portion of the city (in this case, Johannesburg) and, no doubt, interrupting the tanning efforts of many would-be sun worshippers. No matter, because the poor aliens' ship is broken, and its crew descends to earth for help – only to be corralled into alien ghettos by downright unfriendly humans who just treat them like, well, sub-humans. Now, just why the aliens – called prawns by the alienist humans – allow themselves to be so imprisoned is poorly explained. But, that's part of the delicious allegory, however.Essentially, the movie opens with a private company – MRU – beginning the process of getting all those no good aliens off their butts, outta those slum dwellings and outta sight into to some other corral 250 kilometers away from the city, and – let's face it – outta the way of the humans too...From that point, the satire is poured on, thick and fast, as the hero – some would say jerk – in charge, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) sees the eviction and transportation scheme going to pieces when other factions muscle in with more permanent ideas – like, death for the aliens, for instance. By the end of a bad day for Wikus, a worse one for the bad guys, and a cornucopia of crunching collisions between machines, men, and aliens, the viewer might be left drenched in the sweat of excitement – but, thankfully, not in the gory blood, body parts and guts that are liberally thrown about and which often spatter the camera lenses. All good fun, hey...For me, the best part about the film is the comedy supplied by Wikus as he tries to save the day – for himself, largely – and the unintended (?) hilarity of the fight sequences between the bad humans and the good aliens. Talk about over the top gore mixed with humour: Nightmare on Elm Street is kid's stuff by comparison. Hang on, Nightmare is kid's stuff...Oh, well, while on the topic of other movies, you should know that District 9 slavishly copies species metamorphosis from The Thing (1984) and The Fly (1986), powerful weaponry similar to that in the latest Terminator offering, and gallons of gore from the Predator series. So, all in all, Distruct 9 – sorry, District 9 is a pretty darned good action flick. Technically, it's very good too: doing for $30 million what cost Cameron's backers $300 million for his Avatar adventure, but without the 3D, of course. And, while on Avatar, you'll note distinct motivational similarities between Wikus in District 9 and the marine hero Jake in Cameron's epic; and you'll also see the organic/machine merge – as in Avatar – to let rip the ultimate intelligent killing machine. The cinematography, CGI and editing all meld to great effect for a frenetic, and often funny, 112 minutes.In sum, as pure escapist entertainment it's an interesting film, with an even more interesting semi-documentary structure to it at the beginning and the end. Hence, overall, I'd recommended it to those who like to see something different in sci-fi – and combining a not-so-subtle message about intolerance, which, as some would know, has been the subject of cinema ever since D. W. Griffith made Intolerance in 1916.Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose, as the French say.",7,0,4,17 February 2010
28 Days Later...," You want horror? You got it here. This is a horror of a movie
","Is there anything substantially good to say about his movie? Well, the cinematography is good, as is the editing; and the special effects are reasonably well done. The empty streets of London are suitably eerie in the first twenty minutes or so.Beyond that, however, this narrative a nothing more than The Day of The Triffids (1962) redux and only passably better than that earlier horror of a film.Here's the story, in case you don't know about the Triffids story: sometime in the future, horrible virus kills/sends insane almost all people in the world; young man wakes up in hospital, escapes London with two females, fighting mad zombies all the way; finally reaches sanctuary in rural mansion where British soldiers maintain a last stand; situation with soldiers deteriorates because they want the women for sex and survival of humanity; young man and women finally break out from internecine strife that kills all the soldiers in gory glory; young man and women then flee north and are finally found by 'good' authorities (we think...).Along all that way, there are more than enough opportunities for the special effects people to show you just how many ways a body can be gutted, maimed, hacked to pieces, tortured, smashed, bashed, garroted, and riddled with bullets. So, if that's your thing, then this one's for you.Okay, so the subtext is a metaphor for H5N1 (bird flu)  or some other virus -- that's now lurking in the background, all around the world, and probably mutating, as I write, to allow transmission from human to human... Movies such as this one, however, don't help to educate anybody about anything except fear.Oh, sorry, this film is just entertainment, is it?I first caught this movie on late night TV and sat down to watch what I thought might be an interesting horror flick; after fifteen minutes or so, I was so bored I switched it off. Then, months later, I read a review of 28 Weeks Later (due out soon) and was intrigued sufficiently to get 28 Days Later to have a second look. I'm now sorry I did, because it truly is a waste of time to watch. And from what I've read about the sequel, that's worse.So, see it if you must, but don't let your kiddies know.",3,2,5,21 May 2007
Django Unchained," Where Tarantino shows how to ruin yet another story.
","Once again, Tarantino has failed to deliver. And, he's been doing that ever since he finished the respectable Reservoir Dogs (1992), his best attempt at making movies.The storyline synopsis on the main page is sufficient to get the main theme. Instead, let me present a few points that make this effort as Tarantino's worst effort so far, imo (he is consistent though – each successive movie has been progressively worse than the previous).First, it's supposed to be satire, but it degenerates into campy excess, throughout. Second, the gratuitous violence is simply bizarre, especially the bloodbath in the third act. Third, the treacly, anachronistic, overly loud sound track is boring, distracting and just plain stupid. Finally, and worst of all, a topic about slavery in the Deep South doesn't deserve to be presented like one of Ed Wood's failed projects (and I'm denigrating Mr Wood by saying that).I should add, also, that the movie was at least an hour too long. On the plus side, the filming, editing and special effects are okay.However, there have been much better movies about slavery in USA, beginning with Birth of a Nation (1915), then Gone with the wind (1939), Mandingo (1975) and others.Don't waste your time and money to see DU. I didn't pay a dime, not a cent. But I did waste 165 minutes of my life.Give this 2 out of 10. Not recommended, period.",2,10,17,24 June 2013
The Lives of Others," A defining moment for a good man in the midst of corruption.
","While the credits begin to roll, and as Captain Wiesler's (Ulrich Müle) face - transformed by muted joy - fades to black, I pondered, for a long time, the sheer brilliance of this finely crafted narrative from an equally brilliant first-time writer/producer/director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.This film is positive proof that, for the most part, it is the story that makes or breaks. That's not to say this film is without flaw; but, I'll come to that below.Fade in starts in 1984 - a nicely ironic touch, I thought, given that the setting is the police state of the GDR  East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down. Wiesler is employed as an interrogator with the East German State Police, or Stasi. In the first few minutes, you witness his cold, calculated finesse in destroying a prisoner's claims of innocence. So also, you learn that Wielser is as cold as the state that produced him, perhaps colder than the concrete walls that house the hapless prisoners. Real joy is apparently beyond Wiesler's ken; his only smile is when he knows he's trapped his prisoner in a tissue of lies.His superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), knowing Wiesler's expertise, gives him a new task: dig up some dirt on one of the state's favorite sons  Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright and novelist of international repute who still manages to toe most of the Party line. Or does he?Grubitz, however, has a hidden agenda: he wants damaging evidence against Dreyman because his superior, the lecherous Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) lusts after Dreyman's girl friend, Christa-Maria (Martina Gedek), a well-known and acclaimed stage actress. Wiesler, initially unaware of that tangle, jumps at the chance because he knows such a high-profile case will help his career along. Or so he thinks...Hence, Dreyman's apartment is bugged and then monitored by Wiesler and his assistant, Udo (Charly Hübner), from a hidden loft at the top of the apartment block; and so 24/7, they begin to listen to the everyday lives of others. And, in doing so, something happens to Wiesler: he becomes interested, curious, inquiring, concerned and finally involved directly. Thus, his transformation from a cold automaton under state socialism into an engaged and sympathetic human being begins...and is, I think, also a metaphor for the transformation of the GDR later, when the Wall comes down.These are the times that I wish I knew German better. The sub-titles, however, are very good. Hence, don't be deterred: this is an unhurried story that is told with a minimum of words with the camera in medium close-up and close-up for much of the time, thus allowing the actors to let their emotions say what words often cannot.The plot itself is completely linear, each scene naturally following, so there is little chance of confusion for the viewer. Hence, when the tension comes, you're ready for it; when an ironic twist occurs  and there are many - you immediately know why, and either smile, cry or cringe; when tragedy strikes, you almost know it was going to happen anyway. But, it is at the end, when Dreyman and Wiesler both realize, at different times, the common thread that binds them irrevocably, that the full impact of the title hits: when you come to know the lives of others, you come to know yourself for who and what you are. So only the hardest of hearts will turn away from the thrill, the sheer joy, which lights up Wiesler's face as the final scene fades to black. That ironically beautiful ending, I'm sure, will be much discussed, debated and admired for years, if not generations, to come.As Wiesler, Ulrich Müle, with a striking resemblance to Anthony Hopkins, is simply outstanding; his performance is flawless. This is his movie, no question, despite the quality of the rest of the cast. Equally, the cinematography, direction and editing are first class. Moreover, it's quite obvious also that the production was not expensive, attesting to the fact you don't need a lot of money to craft a brilliant story and film. In that regard, the Cohen brothers' first film, Blood Simple (1984) comes to mind as a (lesser) comparison.And the flaw? Perhaps not so much a flaw as two narrative quirks: why was it relatively easy, in the Dreyman case, for Wiesler to throw off years of loyalty to the party and the state? Perhaps it was just the straw that broke the camel's back? And, while listening to others' lives, why does Wiesler go to the trouble of typing up a concurrent report summary instead of using tapes to record all the conversations and do the typing later? It seemed such a backward step, operationally, because he was so used to recording his interrogations of prisoners. I have some ideas, but I'll leave you to sort out your own.Some may complain about the length (137 min); others may yawn at what they consider to be unnecessary scenes. In my opinion, however, there's not a wasted shot, frame or scene: this is filming and story telling at its best, and deservedly won the Academy Award 2007 for Best Foreign Film.As a final point, this story is  perhaps unintentionally - also an obvious and timely warning about the excesses that any state, regardless of politics, can initiate and maintain in the name of national security.",10,7,9,21 March 2008
A Quiet Place," Where silence is shown, once again, to be golden
","No doubt, you've read the brief story summary on the title page. So, there's no real need for me to repeat what you already know about the basics, the actors and so on.What's intriguing, though, about this production is that the cast and crew artfully managed to keep the big holes in the narrative out of most viewer's focus, so to speak. They did that, I think, by generating truly effective suspense which, obviously, keeps viewers on edge for perhaps half the time or more. Fortunately the mundane gaps - that is, relatively ordinary family matters and daily interaction - are just enough to maintain interest; until the next danger point.The most obvious narrative hole is the fundamental premise: the necessity to maintain utter silence at all times to ensure safety. When I read about this movie a year ago, I soon thought that it would be smart to have constant sound of some type radiating out to mask noise generated by the humans. Well, I'll let you discover what this resourceful family actually did.Another aspect that disappointed me is the use of sign language only for most of the movie. The reason for it's use is clearly obvious; but, for those who are not much familiar with that facility, it would have been helpful to have some form of subtitles.Suffice to say, despite those and other faults, this movie still held my interest, if for no other reason than to savor the special effects.There's another interesting aspect about this movie: from a financial perspective, it has already outperformed Avatar (2009) concerning ROI. Avatar has returned 12 times its investment to producers. This recent effort has managed a better ratio: for a 17 million price, the global gross is now 332 million - 19 times the investment.Is this a better movie? No, for many reasons. However, if you have a couple of hours free, see how you react to the suspense in this one. Enjoy.Recommended. But, not for kiddies. Six out of ten for this one.May 19, 2019",6,0,0,19 May 2019
Children of Men," In a world with no future, who can save the world?
","From the mind of P.D. James  a well-known writer of dramas and thrillers  comes a scifi thriller set in the 2027. I haven't read the book (written in 1992) and I understand that the producers of this film have taken some liberties with the narrative; nevertheless, it's a credible picture of a future scenario that is possible, given the current worldwide reduction in male fertility and the now global negative rate of natural increase in births.The story, however, takes those facts to a logical conclusion: fertility, in 2027, is all but dead as the story opens, with an announcement that the youngest person in the world had just died at the age of eighteen. From that point, the story follows Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a public servant, who  against his will initially  must assist a young pregnant woman across England to meet up with The Human Project, a ship-borne scientific group that is desperately seeking an answer to the fertility problem. The pregnant girl, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) is thus more valuable than life itself as she is seen as the savior of humanity  maybe.The story is episodic, as Theo fights his way, with Kee, to the coast where he finally manages to get her onto the Tomorrow, the ship operated by the mobile Human Project; but, only after many have died, and he and Kee have endured almost insuperable hardship. To relate too much more would detract from the excitement, suspense and surprises the viewer experiences along the journey.As Theo, Owens gives his best performance I've seen yet (and proves again that he's got better five o'clock shadow than Bruce Willis any day); Julianne Moore as his ex-girl friend, Julian Taylor, is powerful and dominant; Michael Caine as his old buddy, Jasper Palmer, hams it up a bit, but never goes over the top; the rest of the cast is solid. Frankly, however, with such a fast-paced story, it's difficult to keep up with the constant change in characters as Theo continues his quest.Two particular scenes are memorable: the desperate escape by Theo, Kee and others in a car that won't start as it rumbles down a hill with killers in hot pursuit; and the final battle scene in which Theo and Kee find themselves enmeshed. As I watched, spellbound, at the latter, I couldn't help thinking that it looked every bit as real as current news footage from Baghdad, Gaza City, Mogadishu or some other equally dangerous place of despair. Truly, this is how some  but not all  humans react to perilous times when survival is at stake every minute of the day. Not a pretty sight; and one that was captured so well, the film deservedly won many awards for best cinematography.Arguably, from a narrative perspective, there is a very obvious religious metaphor in the form of Kee with the new child  this century's Madonna and Savior, with Theo as a surrogate Joseph, protector of the 'family'. I'll leave you to decide that for yourself...Recommended for adults and young adults too: the latter should know, now, what the future could be like if things start to go wrong genetically  as, indeed, they appear to be, already.",8,1,5,21 May 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Where a hack journo plus computer hacker hack away at family secrets.
","The Europeans excel at producing thriller movies. This, the first of a trilogy, maintains that high standard.The story: a disgraced journalist is hired by the head of a super-rich industrialist family to find his niece, Harriet, who disappeared forty years earlier. Together with a raunchy, Gothic, young female computer hacker, the two unlikely partners in detection unravel the mystery of Harriet's disappearance and unearth a horrific family secret.As stories go, it's on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense that gradually builds to a finale that includes a nod to Silence of the Lambs (1991) and others similar. So, yes, the plot treads well-known territory; however, it's distinctive from others you may recall, in that the young female hacker is one of the cleverest and toughest female protagonists to grace the screen since Ripley socked it to the mother of all Aliens (1986).So, it's an ultra-violent (at times), in-your-face tour-de-force combination of introspective and analytical detection, coupled within moments of brutality that some will – for sure – find difficult to watch; in that regard, I'm reminded of the gory brutality of Eastern Promises (2007). The acting is, in my opinion, almost flawless; only some of the early scenes and clips seemed a bit stagy. Kudos, however, go to the two main stars: Michael Nyqvist as the convicted journalist, Mikael Blomqvist; and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander – a newcomer for me, and one whom I will continue to watch as her career develops.Cinematography, editing, and sound-track are all topnotch, as expected from well-produced and financed Swedish films. Coupled with a narrative structure and script that grab you by the throat, I had no trouble sitting through the entire 152 minutes without any fidgeting or clock watching. Overall, the pacing and the gradual revelation of the interlocking story details reminded me very much of the way the mystery unfolded in The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), one of the best mystery/detective stories ever put to film (although, the book was much better).My only (muted) criticism of the story comes to this: while I know, from personal experience, that almost unbelievable co-incidences do actually occur, there is one very necessary story co-incidence – a married couple, on honeymoon, who take and keep a crucial photograph – without which the mystery would have forever remained unsolved. You'll know it when you see it.And see this one, I think you should, despite any misgivings you might have about reading sub-titles. It's a very visual story, and the talking is just enough. I'm eagerly looking forward to the second and third chapters. Highly recommended.",7,0,2,30 October 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Back to the future, with a metaphor for American politics that is still running...
","This is movie that many in the USA would find hard to take, or even to pay money to see.In the first place, it's the sort of story that most Americans would probably find unpalatable: not only is it about an episode in American history that is still a blot on the essence of democracy anywhere, it's a stark parallel with some of the more dubious practices of the current Bush administration about which most are familiar. Of course, history from around the world is full of corrupt politics and politicians; so many Americans are no doubt aware that they are not alone, in that regard.In addition, it iswella purely political story and, these days, not too many cinema-goers and DVD buyers are interested in politics, especially politics from the 1950s.And that's a real shame because, politics aside, it's an extremely detailed and well-produced film. The period sets are exquisite; the jazz music is great; the dialog is spot on; the acting is superb and the seamless use of actual footage of the senate hearings, with the late Joseph McCarthy, is eerily real. Over the years, I'd seen a number of documentaries that featured the senator, but this is out of this world (no pun intended). And, the use of black and white photography simply made it all the better.It's not a movie for action fans, for romantics, those who want thrillers, or the comedian in you. This is drama of the highest order, although there are some great wisecracks between Clooney (as Fred Friendly) and Strathairn (as Ed Murrow); but, you have to listen carefully, or you'll miss 'em.Although it did poorly at the Oscars (not unexpected, I would imagine) it's a credit to the producers, the director and the actors that this movie was completed and shown around the world. I just hope that Hollywood is able to continue to present such quality cinema during these trying times for the USA and the rest of the world.",9,1,2,10 September 2006
Mulholland Drive," Where it's the death of dreams, or just a nightmare before death?
","This is a thriller that grabs you from the first scene to the last. For this review, I won't discuss much of the plot; better you watch the whole movie and enjoy the trip. Instead, I will outline the underpinnings of the story and provide a resolution  at least, how I see it.If you haven't seen the movie, then you may not want to read any further.The difficulty with the film, according to the many reviews here (and elsewhere), is the structure, with its many plot twists and turns. For those who know Lynch's style, however, you're well prepared for his convolutions, the out-of-sync narrative, the creepy camera work through darkened corridors, the odd-ball characters, the seemingly impossible situations and symbols...Although, being prepared doesn't necessarily mean ultimate comprehension: Lynch, after all, doesn't go out of his way to help anybody unravel any of his thrillers, particularly the one prior, Lost Highway (1997) and, most recently, Inland Empire (2006).Mulholland Drive sits between those two, being yet another exploration of how the mind works  or how Lynch (and others) thinks it works  under the most extreme conditions. Again, based upon the reviews here (and elsewhere), there are many differing opinions  just as there are always many interpretations about any work of art. I think it's likely, however, that every artist has a personal interpretation about his/her own piece of work i.e. the one that is true. Recall that Lynch is on record as saying (I paraphrase here) that his films are examples of art in motion. Hence others will no doubt see the truth of this film differently.Let me briefly discuss the apparent story first. As a longtime observer of Hollywood, Lynch takes a simple premise: what can happen to a young, bright, intelligent girl aching to be a star? That's been done so many times before, it's almost banal: Morning Glory (1933), Stage Door (1937), A Star is Born (1937 and many remakes), All About Eve (1950), Frances (1982), and so on.Lynch, in his inimitable fashion, turns that premise into a nightmarish vision of seedy power plays between producers, directors and actors, coupled with a gut-wrenching mystery concerning a young woman, suffering from amnesia resulting from a severe auto collision. She has a bag full of money and a couple of hit men after her. She stumbles from the accident and hides in the apartment of a young and hopeful actor. After hearing the amnesiac's story, the actor joins forces with the hapless woman and the intrepid two set out together to solve the mystery of the money and the hit men.Now, as a story, it works, despite the confusing plot line: it's tense, exciting, mysterious, threatening, sexy, violent, ironic, funny  in fact, all those things we all come to expect in thrillers. It's the sort of stuff (the stuff of dreams and nightmares) many directors do well: the late Hitchcock, Scorsese, De Palma, Mann, Friedkin and many others have churned out such for years.Lynch, however, always likes to mislead and misdirect the viewer's attention from the real story behind the story. So Mulholland Drive, I suggest, has more in common with at least two other films: Donnie Darko (2001) and Jacob's Ladder (1990)  and, while I think of it, perhaps also with a nod to Heaven Can Wait (1943), where Henry Van Cleeve (Don Ameche) has another stab at indulging his sexual fantasies before he dies.The first two films explored the last jumbled thoughts of the central character during the throes of death, while HCW extended the idea to a comedic second chance, and quite simplistically. As we all know, many say that your life flashes before your eyes at the point of dying. So, I think Lynch took that idea and constructed the Mulholland Drive narrative using the last agonized thoughts of Betty/Diane (Naomi watts) as she tried to justify her murderous nature  just as Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) constructed his fantasy as the 747 engine falls on him, and as Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) gasps his last on the operating table in Vietnam.For me, it's the only solution that makes sense, bringing complete narrative closure. The cast and the acting are, as you would expect, up to the demands placed upon them by Lynch: all in all, a superb production and presentation. The violence and sex are never gratuitous, although some may be repelled by the lesbian sex scenes.As a subtext, Lynch once again implicitly condemns the excesses of the Hollywood system and how it tends to subvert all that is good and fine about the art of film and acting, often resulting in real-life personal tragedy for some participants. But, that's life, more or less, in just about any profession, I reckon. In Hollywood, it's just more visible...Recommended for all fans of thrillers and a must-see, of course, for Lynch fans.",9,1,2,26 July 2006
Cold War," Where indecision in love leaves much to be desired.
","After reading the reports and hype about this movie, I knew I had to see it.I'm glad I did, because the mise en scène of the entire story is so evocative of the 1940s and 1950s, I felt almost transported to those long-gone days, especially with the 4:3 ratio which formed all of my viewing space in those days.That all said, the movie is still somewhat disappointing. The love story is just not sufficiently interesting for me to develop any real liking of the main characters; I really did not care about either of them. The episodic nature of the narrative is somewhat jarring, and marred by relatively long cuts to a black screen before the next 'episode' begins. And the story of an on-again, off-again romance is, well, just ordinary to the point of banality, almost.On the plus side, the acting is, by and large, excellent. Camera work is up to par - despite my above comment about long cuts. The local music is interesting, to a point; background music quite fitting. Overall, the director Pawlikowski did a good job. This is the second movie of his I've seen, the first being Ida (2013) which I admire much more.Overall, I'm happy to say I'm glad I did see this movie, to the extent of recommending it for adults, despite its flaws for me. But which allows for only a five out of ten as my rating.",5,0,2,5 July 2019
Into the Wild," Where a young man with a wild heart makes a bad call.
","I read the book soon after it was published, in the mid-1990s, I think. It was an impressive piece of writing to chronicle the wanderings of the misguided Chris McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch) who finally decides to forgo all human contact in the wilds of Alaska. If nothing else, McCandless had the courage of his convictions, even if he was remarkably ill-prepared for his adventures.Convictions, however, can come back to bite you, unless you're prepared to learn from experience and change your ways. In that regard, the film fails to deliver the whole story. Hence, I'd urge interested viewers to get the book from a local library and read it – if not all of it (although, it's a relatively short non-fiction narrative), then definitely the end.The photography, though, is excellent. The acting by all the characters is very natural – indeed, almost flawless and with special mention for Hal Holbrook (as old Ron Franz) who has scenes with Hirsch that are truly amazing in their emotional effectiveness.Hirsch, of course, carries the film and story. I'd not seen him before in a film; without doubt, however, he is excellent in the role. Though, it would be instructive to see him in another story and context. Sean Pen produced and directed this and did a competent job for a pedestrian (no pun intended) story that some say is overlong. Perhaps it is.The film is remarkable for me from another aspect, however: with a total of fifty-four film locations, I think this film wins, hands down, as the one that's traveled to the most. Even the epic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) went to only thirty-two; and the other epic from that same year, The Longest Day, managed to get out to only a dozen or so. There is no Oscar for highest number of locations, though.Overall, though, I think, this type of film would have been better handled by Werner Herzog, famous for many fiction and non-fiction films – particularly Grizzly Man (2005), a documentary about another young man who thought he could live with wild bears. That's a better movie story than Into The Wild.However, if you want to see many barren and lonely parts of the USA, followed by the wild, forbidding beauty of Alaska, then do see this movie. Or, you could just see a National Geographic documentary, instead. For the whole story about Chris McCandless, though, get the book and read it.I recommend this film for Penn fans, mostly, and nature lovers.",6,0,1,18 February 2011
Avatar," A delightful huggermugger of technical wizardry versus a vengeful Gaia.
","I'll say this for James Cameron: he always entertains, good and bad.First up, if there was an Academy Award for Best Imagination, Cameron would get the nod for Avatar, in my opinion. This production takes Cameron's visionary approach to story-telling to a new level and has indeed set a new benchmark in film art. When viewed in 3D at the cinema, this experience will leave all but the jaded in a state of awe, almost, with the most thrilling mix of fantastic creatures and battle scenes that may not be equaled for a long, long time.However...don't pay too much attention to this story. Because it's been told too many times before, in different ways. Think of Dances with Wolves (1990); recall Broken Arrow (1950); remember The New World (2005); consider Apocalypse Now (1979); or, even On the Waterfront (1954) – in each of which, the protagonist hero turns his back on his own kind to fight on the side of the 'alien' or 'hostile' gang or horde. The fact that Cameron's setting is hundreds of years in the future is neither here nor there: thematically, it's the same story.The most imaginative feature for me is the application of the Gaia principle – the entire moon of Pandora is an interconnected living thing – to assist the Na'vi in defeating the hated invaders i.e. us. And it's no accident the moon is called Pandora: if you recall your Greek mythology, you'll know what happens to those who open Pandora's box: full of horrible nasties ready to kill you. And, oh yeah, this movie also rehashes the timeless Pocahontas theme.So, the real power in Cameron's story is entirely allegorical: in the same way that we humans are slowly poisoning and destroying the Earth around us, so also the invading army on Pandora – the mythical moon to a much larger planet – is intent upon pillaging or destroying whatever necessary to gain 'unobtainium', that rarest and most expensive of rare metals. On that point, you have to admire Cameron's chutzpah in using that name - almost the best joke in the story.The best, however, comes at the end – naturally – when the Na'vi indigenes corral all the Earthly mercenaries to ship them back to their own dying planet: a nice self-referential twist on Pogo's sentiment that 'We have met the enemy and he is us.'The cast and script are up to the job, but nothing to garner awards. Those will come, deservedly I think, for a host of technical aspects – cinematography, editing, sound, special effects etc – that make this film unique. And maybe even for best director. Some lines and scenes bear striking resemblance to aspects of prior Cameron movies; but, I guess it's okay to rehash bits of your own stuff.Anyway, go and see it on the big screen – you'll be sorry if you wait for DVD. I broke my fifteen year hiatus from actual cinema-going just to experience this one as it should be. You might even go twice, as I did...",7,3,7,6 January 2010
The Artist," What you get with a silent ode to the silent era of Hollywood.
","I finally got around to see this French production of a modern silent movie. It's a visual treat of old-fashioned, black and white cinematography in a picture perfect Hollywood setting.There, we see an aging, Douglas Fairbanks look-alike star, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) who is unable to transition from the silent era to talkies after 1930 and who gradually fades from the scene, literally and figuratively. On the way down and out, he meets an aspiring, vivacious young actress, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) who makes it big, especially when the industry moves to sound. The fairly conventional plot then takes the viewer for a ride through the ups, according to Peppy, and downs, according to George, of Tinsel Town.Along the way, we are hugely entertained by an Oscar worthy dog (George's constant companion), extravagant costuming, great music to accompany the silent movie, a bevy of well-known Hollywood actors, excellent acting and proof, once again, that a movie is always visual art, first and foremost.Jean Dujardin is superb - a perfect portrayal of a silent screen star. He's so good, it defies adequate description. His co-star, Berenice Bejo matches his performance, but is always overshadowed when together – except perhaps in the dancing scenes. There's a good balance between comedy and melodrama, with most of the former provided by Uggie, the dog.Blending it all together under the direction by Michel Hazanavicius, the result is a cinematic experience that will probably never be repeated equally well, if at all. Sure, the story is ordinary, but structure, montage and mise-en-scene make this movie extraordinary – almost to the point that one feels transported back in time. That's entertainment, folks, and not to be missed, even if you've never seen a silent movie.No movie is perfect, but this one deserves nine out of ten. Recommended for all.February 12, 2013",9,3,5,11 February 2013
Reservoir Dogs," The League of Gentlemen (1960), this is not
","There have been many caper movies that include a heist, probably too many for the crime genre. Among them is the one mentioned in my summation line, plus  for the modern set - Oceans 11, 12 and 13 (give me a break, puleese) and for those who remember where it all started: The Asphalt Jungle (1950); Rififi, the Jules Dassin classic from 1955; and, later, Pekinpah's ode to violence, The Getaway (1972), Steve McQueens's best role.The common theme, of course, is how some rat in the ranks makes everything turn sour for the others.There are two things that make this one different to the others: the violence exceeds all those mentioned (and probably all other heist movies) and the narrative is deliberately fractured by the writer/director (Tarantino) as a means of creating suspense for the viewer.As an experiment in using that plot device, it works: the story is terribly fractured, making it just a bit more difficult to get the picture first time round. The long list of FAQs for this one is mute evidence in support. When I saw the film in 1992, for the first time, I was intrigued but also disappointed. Seeing it again on DVD, I think Tarantino sacrificed clarity for the sake of speeding up the action  because, being such a talky film, he had to keep the action going to appease the audience. This, after all, was a diamond heist that went wrong, not a garage sale for diamonds...Some might argue that the violence is excessive. I disagree, mainly because Tarantino very explicitly laid out what types of men these were during the overly long talkfest at the lunch feast: misogynist, narrow-minded, callous, racist and psychotic  but, in an exchange completely at odds with those attitudes, showed them dipping in to help out the waitress with a big tip. The only reason for that must be to show just how different Mr Pink (Steve Buscemi) is to the rest - which is important throughout this narrative.So, the violence that follows is quite in character for all of them, even for Mr Orange (Tim Roth) who shoots a woman who shoots him, as he and Mr White (Harvey Keitel) steal her car. I think Tarantino did a good job in showing just how violent these violent people can be, leaving the viewer with an implied lesson, of course: don't do crime, or crime will do you! It was great to Lawrence Tierney again - even though he was almost impossible to recognize (playing the Big Boss, Joe Cabot) as I'd seen him in many B movies in my youth.In the end, however, I'd didn't care two hoots for any of the characters, except for Officer Nash (Kirk Baltz), the only person with real courage and honour, as he refused to reveal who the rat was.This was the first Tarantino film I saw. It's not his best. If you want that, see Jackie Brown (1997), an Elmore Leonard novel that Tarantino puts to film very well.",6,0,2,19 November 2007
Titanic," Commercially, a titanic success, great direction, but...
","Before this film, the director, James Cameron was best known for action thrillers such as Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss and True Lies  all of which delivered the goods for action fans. After sitting through Titanic, however, I think he should have stayed with the true action-thriller genre, because when you mix genres, you can get mixed results. And, in this case, it shows...The story of the Titanic is well known: an 'unsinkable' ship sinks on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912 with most of the male passengers dying. Cameron, using the technical wizardry he'd perfected in his earlier works, made you feel as though you were actually there, instead of being a mere spectator; the special effects are truly stunning. For action fans, that aspect of the film is relatively brief, however, because the bulk of the film and the very contrived plot are more concerned with the recovery of a fabulous jewel  a symbol of love -- from the existing wreck, left there by the heroine, Rose (Kate Winslet) with her all too brief lover, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) who perishes as the ship sinks. How the two lovers come together in the film and how the jewel comes to have so much significance forms the basis of the plot; the details of the sub-plot  the actual events leading to and including the sinking -- are mere props to the overall story of first love. The metaphor is thus complete  as the ship sinks on its first voyage, so also first love sinks.All of that is explored in flashback, as a burgeoning love between two people who would not otherwise have met, anytime, anywhere else. So the actual loss of the Titanic is, in that sense, incidental to the greater loss suffered by each and every person who lost a loved one in that tragedy. To that extent, the film succeeds in its presentation but only because of the calibre of the acting. As an account of the tragedy of the Titanic, however, it's a misnomer and a failure; while, as entertaining escapism  well, as the saying goes -- nothing succeeds like excess.To find out how the tragic event actually happened, you'd be better off getting a copy of A Night To Remember (1958) from your video store instead.",5,2,3,31 August 2006
The Departed," Double dealing with a vengeance
","The debates will probably rage on for years: Has Scorsese done his best work here?Like many in this forum, I've seen all of his movies. From the aspect of thrills-a-minute, edge of your seat action, I think I'd say this is his best movie. However, as gangster movies go, I still prefer Gangs of New York (2002). For suspense, Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear (1991) beats them all, I think. And, for characterization, Raging Bull (1980)  the movie that should have got him an Oscar  is still without equal, for me. Having said all that, however, The Departed is still the overall winner, mainly because the story is so well constructed and delivers the best double twist  or is it triple?  I've seen for many a year. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to think of a better one...So, I won't be saying too much about the actual plot (the sequence of events), but the story is basically this: two young graduates of the police both act as undercover agents, one as a mole inside the Boston Irish mafia, the other as a mole for the same Irish mafia inside the Boston police force. The story centers around the two moles trying to unmask the other and it's a race to see who gets in first, so to speak. Aaaah, such irony...With a stellar cast of just super actors, this film just had to turn out right: too many careers were on the line, I think. And, it did turn out right. There's not a false note by any of them, with one exception: I wasn't convinced that Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) as the police psychiatrist could be so stupid to become the lover of both moles. I can suspend my disbelief about a lot of things to carry on with a narrative, but that just doesn't ring true. However, it serves a purpose, as you will find out; and that suggests to me that such artificiality was injected for that very reason. But, I could be wrong...Generally, it's fast paced, as I implied, but there are a few slow spots for me, mostly to do with Madolyn with the moles. To keep pace with the action, the editing is quite the best I've seen; the sequence when a body lands, from a great distance, on a city street in front of one of the moles in unbelievably precise, timed to the millisecond, but believably gruesome.Jack Nicholson is just superb as the gangster boss, affable yet entirely menacing; Ray Winston  always my favorite gangster  is an excellent sidekick and trusted friend for the boss; Alec Baldwin again shows his implacable nature as one of the police heads, Ellerby  just as affable as the gangster boss, and almost as menacing when needs be; Martin Sheen, as Queenan, the head of the undercover section, brings perhaps the only honest face into the story; and Mark Wahlberg, an actor I've ignored for a long time, gives a very good impression of a terrier that just won't let go  he's actually terrific in the role of Dignam.As to Di Caprio and Damon, the two young cops: both very accomplished actors and both acquit themselves with very believable portrayals  apart from sharing Madolyn.The only sour note for me was the closing scene, and I mean the very last shot, as the camera pans across the balcony of an empty apartment to show... Well, I'll let you find out. Tsk, tsk  how banal... and how unnecessary.",9,2,3,14 April 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Where life is not a game, as the good doctor discovers.
","I saw Forest Whitaker first in that great British thriller, The Crying Game (1992), and was quite impressed with his performance; only later did I catch up on his earlier movies like Platoon (1986), The Color of Money (1986), Diary of a Hit-man (1991) and many others. In this one, his skill at acting reached a new high and he deservedly won the best actor award at the Awards in 2007.I'm not so enthusiastic about the story, however, for a variety of reasons.As with all historical dramas, there is the problem of stepping into the shoes of real people, and developing realistic scenarios and dialog with which to integrate the addition of fictional characters. I'm aware that that the author had access to a lot of material with which to write his novel and that the character of Dr Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) was based in part upon a real-life English mercenary who was a confidant of President Idi Amin.For this story, however, it is a young Scots doctor, fresh from graduation, beginning his career in Uganda at a medical mission. Through a fortuitous accident, Garrigan gets to treat Amin for a sprained wrist after the President's car crashed into a local cow. Amin is so impressed with Garrigan's spunk at that scene, that he invites the young doctor to Kampala and offers him a job as the President's 'advisor'  and as the chief medical officer at the local hospital; the previous occupant is demoted or fired  I'm still not sure which. Now that's what I call a meteoric rise in status. In that, I can just suspend my disbelief to let the story continue...For the next hour or so, we are then treated to scenes of the strengthening bond between Garrigan and Amin, and seeing only what Garrigan sees: Amin playing soccer with local lads, swimming with his friends at a big party, letting Garrigan take charge of negotiations for the design and construction of a new hospital, and so on. Only occasionally, do we hear the sound of gunfire and smoke from somewhere on the horizon. The good doctor is vaguely uneasy, but is not sure why.However, telling the story from the doctor's perspective allows the author to indulge in whatever takes his fancy  or, in this case, the doctor's fancy. Being a very normal and active heterosexual, live-action Scot - and almost red-headed - Garrigan eventually gets involved with one of Amin's wives. Things get out of hand, and they eventually become highly erotic lovers. The situation worsens when she tells him she is pregnant, and pleads for an abortion. At first he balks, but then agrees. From that point on, his descent into horror is guaranteed - and just as the Israeli hostage situation at Entebbe begins...Whitaker very effectively shows Amin for what he was: an egocentric, erratic, violent, drug-addicted and paranoid dictator of the worst kind; mild words for a man who is reckoned to have slaughtered 300,000 of his citizens. It's not a pleasant portrayal at all, and Whitaker is to be commended for taking on the task. Garrigan, as played by McAvoy however, is totally vacuous, in my opinion: a character so caught up in his own egocentricity that he fails to notice the web in which he's become entangled, and obviously fails to do sensible things like listen to the BBC for real news, read foreign newspapers or even call friends and family in the UK to find out the truth about Amin. No, he does none of those things because he's too busy having a good time, driving the convertible Merc that Amin gave to him, and getting in too deep with one of Amin's wives. And, all the time, he thinks he's getting away with it all... Can a doctor really be that stupid? I suppose so, but in that case, his character is totally unlikable, and he thoroughly deserves the contemptuous nickname for him that is bandied about by Amin's goons.And, on that score, the only likable characters in the whole story are Dr Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his wife, Sarah (Gillian Anderson) who appear only in the first twenty minutes, with Sarah only reappearing once, briefly, as Garrigan tries to flee Uganda. Her look, when she sees him, says it all.It's a well produced and directed film, however; and the soundtrack is lyrical and yet stirring at times, full of the rhythm and beat of African music. It was a real pleasure to hear. In the final twenty minutes, however, the scenes of violence are such that many, I think, will be sickened  but, it's where the good doctor finally wakes up to the living nightmare in which he had been sleepwalking.Not recommended for children. As a piece of real history, it's not worth your time to see. For superb acting, however, Whitaker is worth your time. And McAvoy does a good job with an unappealing role. But, there's a lot of blood at the end.",7,0,1,10 March 2008
Shooter," Shoot  and to think I coulda been washing the car, instead
","This is one seriously banal movie.How many ideas can be stolen from other and better movies, mixed around, and then spewed out into a dog's breakfast of big guns, fast action stunts, cardboard cutout bad guys, and cutie-pie killers masquerading as good guys? Try this one and you'll find out...but I gave up counting, it's sooooo bad.Mark Wahlberg, an actor I've never had much time for, tries to combine all that is worst about Bruce Willis, Big Arnie, and Matt Damon to outdo the three of them with a body count that is beyond laughable. Throw in the obligatory car chase sequence and, hey presto: First Action Hero  Mark 1! The story is so incredibly stupid it's barely worth talking about, but here goes: ex-military sniper Swagger  I kid you not - (Wahlberg) is conned into assisting spooks to stop a supposed presidential assassination attempt. Swagger is blamed when things go wrong. Swagger then swaggers about, hunts down and kills all who conned him, killing anybody who gets in the way of his righteous duty. That's it, in a nutshell. The sniper gets some help along the way, naturally, from another cutie-pie, who's a killer looker but also looking to kill. And some help from a FBI jerk who just happens to be smart. There's always one, right? Shame on Danny Glover and Ned Beatty for appearing in this excuse for entertainment. Greed has no depth, as they rightly point out to each other how much money they'll make in big oil. Wonder how much they were paid to appear as the bad guys? Totally vacuous in any sort of moral underpinnings except don't be cruel to dumb animals: the bad guys shot dead the sniper's dog. Now you've done it, he mutters, as he kills another bad guy...and another...Do you have absolutely nothing to do for two hours? Cut your toenails? Watch TV commercials? No? Well, I guess you'd better see it.",3,10,22,9 December 2007
Inception," Where dreams about past and present realities don't mix too well - or maybe they do?
","Christopher Nolan's imaginative use of filmic structure, script, cinematography and direction provide a passably entertaining story within a story that has, unfortunately, confused many viewers here, and elsewhere, perhaps with its overuse of dream sequences, but certainly with its fantasy caper that often doesn't make any sense.But that's the cunning beauty of this movie: it's deliberately designed to be as confusing and mystifying as your own dreams. For viewers who have not yet seen the film:STOP READING NOW – MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW...After sampling forty plus reviews here, I found two that are on the ball: leda_ananke from Canada who begins 'Its all a dream'; and Danijel Pajur from Ireland who asserts, up front, 'This movie is so predictable that it takes all of 10 minutes to figure it out.'A bit less than '10 minutes' actually: according to my timing, at 3 minutes and 7 seconds into the film, Cobb (di Caprio) says: 'This is a dream and you have a safe-full of secrets and I need to know what's in that safe.' He says it so quickly, however, that many would miss it, or ignore its significance. Director Nolan, however, has told the viewer: You're now in Cobb's dream.The second clue follows very swiftly, just in case you missed Cobb's brazen admission: the whole building shakes, much noise roars, sounds of explosions intrude, and we see through the window, the chaos of fire and smoke, lots of smoke in the streets outside, cars exploding, people rushing about, and heaps of smoke...Thirty minutes into the chaotic plot, we're in Paris with Aridane (Ellen Page) – what a deliciously subversive name from Greek mythology – who's leading Cobb through the dream and stops suddenly to magically bring forth two giant mirrors, positioning them to show Cobb to infinity, in both directions. It's the third clue for viewers and, added to the first, we have director Nolan's explicit and clever admission to you, the viewer: This caper is all smoke and mirrors, dear viewer; don't try to understand – just concentrate on the real story...Which is, quite simply, the crisis of guilt Cobb feels as a result of his wife's death – a death for which he holds himself personally responsible. So, that's the real story: a man's dream about his own guilt complex. (By the way, would the word 'corn' come to mind when you say Cobb?)The parallel story – the corporate mind-blowing and mind-robbing caper – is just a narrative device to allow Cobb's associates to assist his efforts to come to terms with his guilt. And all of which is wrapped up into a convoluted mix of psycho-babble, outrageous and impossible pseudo-scientific equipment, fantastically impossible or improbable situations and a slew of special FX guaranteed to confuse and/or delight those who dwell on such banalities.So that's Cobb's real mission: with a little help from friends to feed him ideas – the Inception of the title – he must face the truth of the circumstances of his wife's death. Hence, if Nolan did indeed set out to confuse his audience about mind-shaping, I'd say he largely succeeded. Which is surprising, because planting ideas into another's mind has been around since the mid-nineteenth century with hypnosis and auto-suggestive techniques, a fact which that consummate thriller writer, Richard Condon, used to great effect when he wrote The Manchurian Candidate back in 1960 (and later filmed twice).Dreams, however, have been used all too often in cinema. A couple of significant examples are, first, Hitchcock's imaginative use of animation in Spellbound (1945) to help solve a murder mystery; and second, William Friedkin confused many viewers with his enigmatic and much-underrated Bug (2006) – a very clever story that keeps you guessing to the very last frame...and beyond. So, despite the overly gushing praise about Nolan's originality, his effort here is original only to the extent that he...er, dreamed it all up, wrote it, and directed it. Moreover, he'd be the first to admit that, I'm sure.From a production and technical perspective, however, the film is top-notch; the acting is adequate to the task of presenting a succession of comic-book characters to assist Cobb's mental and emotional recovery; the special effects are precisely what's needed to keep viewers trapped in Cobb's dream; and the plot – the sequence of events – must be seen because it cannot be sensibly described.Overall, Inception is just the latest filmic effort guaranteed success at box office: the level of hype and hubbub I've heard and seen, online and offline, is every film-makers wet dream. David Lynch does it all the time. So, how can anybody accuse Nolan of failure?The film is not an instant classic, however: it's an average story competently overshadowed by an old idea dressed up to cater to today's visually obsessed audience. The fact that it confuses, annoys, delights and even angers a large (young) population proves that Nolan pushed all the appropriate buttons. Give it a seven out of ten, but wait for the DVD to see it; don't pay exorbitant cinema fees.Nolan now has a problem, though: what next?",7,1,4,11 December 2010
Raging Bull," Where you can almost feel the anger of this very angry fighter.
","Discussion – and argument – will no doubt persist about 'so-and-so is the greatest fighter of all time.' Does it make any sense, except perhaps to stimulate conversation, to keep comparing prize fighters? The only certainty, in this context, is this: if you like boxing and want to see one of the best films ever made about the business, then this is for you.Because, not only will you hear one of the best scripts put to film, see some of the finest acting on film and watch scenes from the explosive career of a boxing legend, you'll also see another of Martin Scorsese's expert work as director. If you shy away from truly crude language, however, you probably won't abide the continual use of the F-word and the sexually explicit language between husbands and wives, and particularly that between Jake (Robert de Niro) and Vicky (Cathy Moriaty).It's all in context, though, and realistically portrays the culture of New York of the 1940s and 1950s. Anyway, for today's younger audience, it's no big deal, that's for sure, to hear such language all the time, just about anywhere now.Jake, as many know, was a hard-headed man: hard in the ring, and hard on his women (and men) with whom he dealt. So, yes, there is much domestic violence that serves as a mirror for the violence that continues in the ring; and where Jake can obviously work off a lot of that anger, a dominant aspect throughout the story, together with Jake's insecurities that feed his jealousies. Robert de Niro is probably the only actor at that time who could have performed the role. So, like Casablanca (1942), Citizen Kane (1941), Hud (1963) and a few others, I wouldn't expect anybody to ever attempt a remake of this masterpiece.Mention must be made of Joe Pesci as Jake's brother, Joey, and his manager for much of his boxing career. Joe Pesci is so natural and powerful an actor, I think he is the only one, I think, who can steal a scene from de Niro. For example, have a look at Goodfellas (1990), one of the greatest gangster flicks ever made (from Scorsese, again).Back to The Bull, however...The rest of the supporting cast is without fault. The photography – black and white, my favorite – editing and sound are superb; and the sound track with much classical music is the cherry on top (for me).For an interesting comparison, try Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) with Paul Newman portraying Rocky Graziano, another middleweight fighter who was a contemporary of Jake LaMotta's. It's almost amazing to me that the two fighters never had a bout together, but they both fought – and lost – against the same man: Sugar Ray Robinson, still the only fighter to win world welter and middle weight titles. Robinson, for the record, is also still regarded as the greatest boxer of all time (so far).Even more interesting is that, according to one online source, Jake LaMotta and Rocky Graziano were boyhood friends and both spent time at the same correctional facility.I recommend Raging Bull as the better, and more gritty movie, but Paul Newman's effort still stands up to scrutiny.May 14, 2011",9,3,5,13 May 2011
Casino Royale," Move over Batman, Spiderman  make way for Bondman!
","Ah, action heroes...gotta love 'em.It's a shame, actually, that Hollywood must now always resort to fast action, fast cars, and fast women to make a meal of good stories.So, forget about the actual story  just watch as Bond (Daniel Craig) breaks through walls a la Terminator, jumps off tall cranes and buildings without a skyhook, swings through dark corridors and stairwells without a bat of an eye  well, almost  while chasing and murdering the bad guys, of which there are many. In fact, M (Judi Dench) even threatens to have him killed at one point... Whew, with friends like that, who needs enemies? This film is interesting for me for three reasons only: first, it's fascinating to see Craig is a role so different for him, despite his early foray in Layer Cake (2004), a gritty gangster movie I really liked; second, the hand-to-hand fight scenes are cruelly well done, equal to or better than any I've seen in the Jason Bourne saga with Matt Damon, who's no slouch at all; and third, the special effects are gripping, almost to the point of stopping breathing as you watch, and testifying to the highly professional cinematography and editing.So, that's entertainment  up to a point. And, that point was reached when Bond (as per the original novel) is tortured in the cruelest fashion...for a man. Those scenes weren't entertaining at all: they make you wince, your skin to crawl and your thoughts to scream 'Stop!' However, I applaud the producer, director and actors for pulling it off: life ain't always nice, and here's why... Hence, if you care about your kiddies' dreams, don't let them see this movie.The crash-up, bash-up aspect is probably a bit overdone for me, but I can imagine how the younger set of today sees it all as almost ordinary, given the diet of Arnie, Damon and Willis movies that have splashed across screens in the last few years.Pity  because with this rehash and restart of the Bond genre, there was a chance to make a difference. Too bad...So, watch this one for the technical skills and excellent production standards, but little else of substance...except perhaps to note Craig's running style, which he does a lot of in this one.",6,0,4,15 January 2008
Son of Saul," Where we truly learn, what hell on earth truly is
","The Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany in World War II is a touchy topic for any movie. Numerous documentaries have graphically shown the camps, the aftermath and the tools; writers and visual artists have expounded viscerally and poignantly for over half a century, and for lasting effect; and, of course, Hollywood and others have given us many biographical or fictional narratives to function as vehicles for holocaust commentary.None of the above, in my opinion, comes anywhere near the power of this movie, by first time writer/director, Nemes Laszo. Initially, the movie title intrigued me: Son of Saul. Which biblical Saul? I wondered. The first few minutes resolved that inquiry when it became evident that Saul Ausländer (Geza Röhrig) is one of the Hungarian-Jewish inmates of the camp assigned - as a member of the Sonderkommando i.e. Special Command - to persecute Jewish prisoners by assisting with herding them into gas chambers to their premature, unavoidable death. The irony of Saul's surname here - in English, Foreigner - serves to align this modern Saul with, naturally, Saul of Tarsus, Jewish and Roman citizen, and hence foreigner, who also persecuted the Jews - that is, until he experienced his life-changing epiphany on the road to Damascus.Röhrig the actor is phlegmatic to the point of being automaton, allowing virtually zero emotion on his face while he, as Saul, ritually and repetitively completes his horrific, daily routine of dispensing death to his fellow Jews. The hand-held camera is almost always on his face or the back of his head as we follow him everywhere in the camp, giving us a voyeuristic sense of heightened observation or even quasi-participation - a disturbingly unsettling feeling. Always in the background, and at the edges, the chaotic sights, unbearable sounds and unforgivable sins of the perpetrators while victims are summarily shot, shoved into gas chambers, thrown into fire, bludgeoned and beaten. These are Saul's days, staying alive for as long as he can, while consigning his humanity to the darkest depths of his persona....Until, unexpectedly, he discovers a young boy still alive - just - in the pile of bodies within a gas chamber: an apparent miracle. It's not clear if Saul knows him, or is even related to the boy. But, from that moment, Saul sets out to get the boy away to safety; and in apparent total disregard for his own life or, for that matter, the lives of his Sonderkommando accomplices in criminal anarchy. Thereafter, we continue to follow Saul as he continues his efforts to achieve his goal before he, also, is consigned to the same fate as all other victims.The denouement, when it comes, is realistic, inevitable and expected, I think - despite the dramatic twist the director inserts shortly before. The setting, acting, direction and camera work are simply outstanding. Never before, in all my time watching movies (sixty-five years and counting), have I been as close to a sense of reality as in this effort. There is harrowing, but also uplifting imagery in this story I will never forget.Highly recommended for mature adults and those interested in holocaust history.

Live Free or Die Hard," Well, if this one doesn't kill the series, what will?
","Die Hard (1988) started it all. I hope this one finishes it  the John McClane franchise...That's not to say that this story and film are all bad. Look, I like Bruce Willis as an actor; he's done some fine work  e.g. In Country (1989), Pulp Fiction (1994) and, yes, Die Hard, already mentioned, and many others.But, with each successive chapter in the McClane saga, the stories just get worse. This last one (I hope) is saved from going down the toilet completely because, for me, it was more a comedy than anything else. Honestly, I nearly fell off my chair laughing at the great one-liners in the script and the absurdly comical and out-of-this-universe action sequences that defy physics and the imagination. For pure action fans, it's manna from heaven, no doubt; for serious cinema-goers, who want a modicum of reality to the story, it's utter tripe.But, as a story, it's entertaining to a point.What's more interesting and entertaining is the subtext of this story: the real probability that, one day, some very smart extremists may in fact succeed in wreaking havoc throughout fundamental services that keep the engines of American political economy working. Now, that is a very scary prospect that could happen.Hence, the need to reduce the whole scenario to comic book proportions so that the mass market can be suitably indoctrinated  and have a bit of fun also. I'd venture to say that the entire Bush administration is gung-ho about the whole production, as are DHS and TSA nationally.Bruce, once again, is the (almost) indestructible tough guy who's caught up in the (home grown) terrorist plot to have a 'fire sale' across USA: everything must go, man, everything. And that means all the money too, as the bad guy boss, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) overacts shamelessly as he begins to shut down all the vital services in the nation. Why? Well, he wants the money because he feels slighted: yes, because the darn Pentagon brass didn't listen to him when he told them what was wrong with national defense and, well, by golly  he's just gonna show them all what can happen, all right?Ably supported by yet another female terminator, Mai (Maggie Q), and an army (almost) of real tough guys  because they're Frenchies, okay, and therefore real baaaad  little Tommy spits the dummy and slugs when John turns up to spoil his party. Wouldn't you just know it?Now, there are some truly spectacular stunts and I have nothing but admiration for those stunt people who put their (real) lives on the line to bring about breath-taking action. Watch, particularly, for a couple of those tough baaaad Frenchies and what they do; almost unbelievable.And, of course, with such a fast-paced story, the editing is stunning, with so many shot-reverse-shot sequences, you just can't keep up. But, hey, it's a Bruce Willis action flick, so it has to be good --- er --- great, right? Pity the producer and director had to copy so many action sequences from other movies  like Jurassic Park 2 (1997), for example. When you see John trapped in a car hanging over an abyss (almost), you'll know what I mean. However, having said all that, is there any action fan who will miss this one? I don't think so...",6,0,1,27 December 2007
Flight," Where we learn that success in life sometimes requires a near-death experience.
","This story is, essentially, a one-man show, about a crack commercial pilot who is also an alcoholic and cocaine addict, maybe even a crack-head. In taking on the role of Whip, Denzel Washington delivers a cracking good performance about a character that you eventually almost love to hate. But, not quite....In a nut shell, the plot begins with Whip's hangover as he prepares for his next flight. To cope, he snorts some coke before he leaves the hotel, and after manhandling his passenger plane on takeoff like a P51 Mustang, he hands the controls over to the young copilot while he covertly mixes a double screw-driver in the galley and as his crew is calming passengers after the turbulent takeoff.Then: disaster. Something breaks in the rear elevator mechanism, the plane goes into a dive, Whip whips back to his seat, grabs the controls which he uses manually (overrides the computer systems) to perform a miraculous maneuver to prevent the plane from drilling for oil - and instead glides it to a belly-flop in a lush green field where the plane breaks up and everything goes black for our hero....That sequence is the best part of the movie - the first twenty minutes: great CGI, excellent editing, fast paced, exciting, even thrilling and entertaining BS. And, it's worth seeing. Arguably, the rest ain't.You recall Denzel in Training Day? Sure, he was a bad guy, but he was so cool, soooo likable, right? Well, Whip's a totally untrustworthy, no-good, dirty, rotten, drunk liar. In his personal flight from reality, he knows it, he denies it to all and sundry, and you can see he's heading for his own hell. Unless something happens to change his ways. Well, your mission, should you want to proceed, it to watch the movie and find what that something is.And, if you do, then think about this also: why on earth was this story ever made into movie? I'll tell you what I think. Instead of some production company making a documentary about all the real-life stories we hear/read about pilots with certain problems who still fly daily, let's put it all to fiction to avoid any possible law suits from a dozen real airlines. But ... but we still get the message across, see: hey, you pilots, listen up - toe the line or, no matter how good you are as a pilot, you are expendable, you are a criminal, and you are going down even if you do save every sorry passenger's life!Hey, now ... it's not often we see an important, pertinent, societal message masquerading as passably good entertainment.There's a good supporting cast with familiar faces. The direction and editing are top-notch. The music's too loud. There's a lot of cussing, and a lot of alcohol and coke, both of which will turn off some viewers. Still, I give it six out of ten and a qualified recommendation, mainly because I like Denzel's (and John Goodman's) acting and his courage for taking on such a lousy, stinking role. Ugh!September 15, 2014",6,2,3,15 September 2014
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Where Craven images succeed excessively
","This review leads to my interpretation of the whole story. Some major plot points are detailed. However, if you know little or nothing of the film, then read no further because this review may spoil the ending, such as it is, for you. See the film, then come back another time, perhaps?But first: I think we all know what is meant by the term 'chop-socky', a term that references physics-defying martial arts films from Hong Kong.Nightmare is a film that I put under the heading of 'chop-sicky' and a film that I deliberately avoided when first released, simply because I wasn't too interested in another specimen of what many call a horror movie, but which is in fact a terror-fantasy or a fantasy-terror, if you like. Chop-sicky just seems more appropriate to me...{For real horror, however, start with House of Wax (1953), then on to Psycho (1960) of course, then Peeping Tom (1960), perhaps The Shining (1980), Blue Velvet (1986), definitely Cronenberg's Dead Ringers (1988), don't miss Lost Highway (1997) and  if you can stomach it  Audition (1999), my own choice as the piece-de-resistance of horror movies. There're many others of course.} There are already some excellent retellings of the Nightmare story here. So, I'll mention it only briefly: Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) was a serial child killer who was murdered by angry parents years prior. Now, he resurrects in the dreams of some of the children of those murderous parents because Freddy now seeks revenge by killing their children. Hence, the plot traces how Freddy serially eliminates Tina (Amanda Wyss), Rod (Nick Corri), and Glen (Johnny Depp), the first and the last in particularly over-the-top (pun intended) gory scenes. The plot continues with Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) setting out to confront and defeat Freddy, while her father, Lt. Thompson (John Saxon) and her mother, Marge (Ronee Blakely) try to keep her from any harm.Now, if you buy that as a viable story, then you've bought into a fantasy where anything goes. Which is precisely what director Wes Craven wants when he has Tina torn to shreds on the ceiling by Freddy's unseen hands; when he has Freddy's knife-encrusted hand appear between Nancy's legs while she's in the bath; when a hole opens up under Glen in bed, and he's sucked down, minced up and then squirted back in a fountain of blood; when Nancy runs through the dark streets pursued by Freddy, but she eludes him, but only just; when Nancy, in class at school, appears to hallucinate about Freddy; when Nancy is trapped inside her home with Freddy and nobody outside, particularly her dad and the cops across the road, will respond to her frantic cries and gesticulations for help; and when Nancy descends down to the basement (oh, my, all alone again) to then wander through a labyrinth to finally defeat the nightmare of Freddy Krueger...All pure fantasy, of course. But, all dreams are fantasies, of one kind or another, with nightmares the worst kind. And this one is heavy with sexual symbolism, but not so far from some of the nightmares that some people have in real life, perhaps. So, does Nancy really defeat her nightmare? In this movie, she doesn't because, the story  the whole caboodle, from opening to closing scene - is revealed as Nancy's own nightmare that is still in progress  thus easily allowing the continuation of Freddy's rampaging in the sequel. In short, we're inside Nancy's head from the get-go. So, good night and good luck, Nancy, continue with your nightmare... and so also you, dear viewer, says Craven.Now, whether the resolution of this nightmare (with all the subsequent Freddy Krueger films) ultimately turns on fantasy or reality, I don't know. Frankly, I don't care because having finally seen this one, I'm quite sure that all the sequels are worse. With few exceptions, sequels do tend to go that way, don't they?Having said that, there's no doubt that Wes Craven (with a less than stellar cast) did a great job with the visuals, the special effects, makeup and editing. Sure, typical slasher stuff, but still technically very good and with great shock effect for the unwary. John Saxon plodded, competently, through the story as he does, usually; Heather Langenkamp overacted and was just too shrill, in my opinion; Johnny Depp was a welcome addition in this, his first movie (and the real reason I finally decided to see this film); and Robert Englund has, arguably, become a legend, but for all the wrong reasons, I think. The stand-out act, however, must go to Amanda Wyss (Tina) with the death sequence on the ceiling {over the top  get it?  and yes, a direct steal from Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973) when the devil raises Regan (Linda Blair) up to the ceiling} that is graphically and bloodily shocking, while also technically quite fascinating.What's that old saying? Yeah - the greatest flattery is copying! Craven, here with buckets of blood, obviously had barrels of laughs making this movie.To sum up, I guess I'd say that, as the first of the series, Nightmare is worth seeing  just so that you can say that you've seen it.Not recommended for kids twelve or less.",5,1,3,8 August 2008
Looper," Where you wonder if you've been loopy to watch it
","This is billed as Action/Crime/Sci-fi. I can accept the first two; the third is incorrect. This story is pure fantasy set to a time in the near future, 2044, where society is inhabited by loopers – hired killers sent back from 2074 to eliminate those sent back to the past – the period in which the story plays out.If you can accept the idiocy of that premise, then by all means see it. If not, then I'd give this one a wide miss – despite the presence of Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the main roles of Old Joe and Joe, respectively. As I watched, I wondered again what some do for money.The plot is filled with many of the usual violent scenes so prevalent in other crime dramas. Nothing new there. Much of the action is stylized, particularly the killing ground for each execution when s/he arrives, trussed up and ready to be killed. Special effects are okay, but nothing extraordinary. Editing is adequate for a fast-paced action movie. The acting is formulaic, all you'd expect from this genre.The movie will, of course, appeal to those viewers who want to see something new, even though time travel stuff has been done too many times already in literature and movies. All that time travel provides is an opportunity to apply new twists to a stupid idea and sell it to viewers who don't bother about absurd paradoxes and impossible plots. Well, I guess for some, it's entertainment.Last week, however, I saw Gamer (2009) which I also thought was a dumb story. After Loopers, though, I must say Gamer at least was, indeed, sci-fi and hence a better movie – although the sound track was way too loud.I'll give Loopers four out of ten. Recommended only for fantasy fans.November 9, 2013.",4,2,6,8 November 2013
The Thin Red Line," A philosophical discourse set against the one of the bloodiest battles of World War Two
","The novel by James Jones has already been put to the screen in a 1964 version. That film followed a more or less traditional war story, loosely based upon the novel. I have yet to see it and will, at some time in the future, post my assessment.In the meantime, this version from Terrence Malick does not disappoint his fans, but it's a war film that has, in a very real sense, a very active role: it engages the viewer in a philosophical discourse about the Big Questions in life. So, if you're looking for an all-action movie, then this is not for you  although the action that is portrayed is probably the best you'll see for a long time to come.On the other hand, if you've often wondered about the finitude of existence, the thought of your own death, the relationship between enemies in combat and our intimate symbiosis with nature, then you'll be well rewarded. Visually, the film is stunning with some of the most sublimely tranquil scenes of natural splendor ever put on film, and in keeping with Malick's prior masterpiece, Days of Heaven, it brings the viewer to confront what it truly means to be human. Dialogue is sparse, for the most part, but Malick makes great use of voice-overs  the private thoughts of various characters as they lay bare their fears and doubts when they come face-to-face with the imminence of their own death.The history concerns the invasion of Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, in 1942  a very important step by American forces to push back the Japanese empire. The personal story, however, concerns three individuals: Capt. Staros, a good man thrown into war who wants to make sure that he protects his men at all costs, even to the point of defying a valid order from Col. Tall; Private Bell, whose only way to hold on to his sanity is to keep the thoughts of his wife alive in his mind, as much as he can; and Private Witt, the rebel, who often goes AWOL, but who is the bravest of the brave and the only one who can and does transcend the nihilism and dehumanizing gore of war.With an Academy Award winning musical score that will haunt you, set against the natural splendour of a pristine paradise that is totally indifferent to the savagery and cruelty that is played out, this is a film that you won't forget. The final battle scene is arguably the finest on film: using hand-held cameras to force the viewer into the battle, running with the combatants of both sides as they maim, shoot, kill and murder each other, the sense of being part of the slaughter is almost too much. But you watch it, as you must, to try to understand what it means to be in a war.War is not a pleasant topic, but this is a film that should be seen. Highly recommended.",9,1,2,23 August 2006
Her," Where we discover a new meaning for Love Thy Neighbor ... maybe.
","This movie is billed as a drama, romance and sci-fi. It's more than that, however: it's a considered peek at part of the real, probable future of the man-machine nexus this century.That theme is encapsulated within the drama of a guy, Theodore (Phoenix), an employee of a company which specializes in composing personal letters for the masses (who are apparently too busy or lazy to do it themselves). During the course of his work, Theo installs a new artificial intelligence operating system on his home computer. And while having his first conversation with the software (voice provided by Johansson), the name of Samantha - shortened to Sam - is chosen.Thereafter, the story is a leisurely-paced talk-fest between Theo and Sam as they explore each other's mind - and body, so to speak. As inter-dependency between them grows, the software gradually develops emotions and feelings which become increasingly human-like. So much so, and despite fundamental difficulties, they fall in love - whatever that means - with each other. As we know, humans are well known for 'falling in love' with their machines; so, it's not much of a stretch to entertain such entertainment. But therein lies the thrust of this story, bleakly exposed with box- cutter clarity when we see Theo - desperate and distraught because Sam is not answering his call - while he sits, bewildered, on a busy subway stairway as commuters mill about and pass him, oblivious to Theo's visible angst. Why? Because they're all - each and everyone - too busy to even watch where they're going as they continue, heads down, to converse with their hand-held machine companions. Love thy neighbor morphs finally into love thy machine as thyself. (Can't help but recall a real-life video clip I saw, of a smartphone-engrossed young person who walked into a water fountain to fall in: phone, bag and body. The person wasn't hurt but it was hilarious to watch.)Phoenix provides another bravura performance - which mirrors the excesses of current rampant technological dependency - while he's also working through a highly stressful marital divorce from his human wife, Catherine (Mara). Happily for Theo, a nearby neighbor, Amy (Adams) provides emotional support when he truly needs it. Just how this emotional mix all eventually works out I'll leave you to see. From my perspective, it's positive overall, although the closing scene is glaringly Hollywoody - no pun intended. If you've seen The Last of the Mohicans (1992), you'll recall that final scene, as comparison.The best piece, though, is left for Sam; and with perfect irony. While 'dating' Theo, Sam is also dallying with, hmmm, faaaaar too many other humans and other operating systems (you'll find out the total when you see it). As a sub-plot, it's a stroke of ironic genius from writer/director Jonze. On reflection, maybe it's just what Theo deserves, though: a wake-up call from a metaphorical water fountain. You be the judge....Yeah, I reckon I'll give this eight out of ten - mainly for the acting and delicious irony. Recommended for all. March 28, 2015",8,0,1,28 March 2015
Donnie Darko," Nothing is ever as it seems
","As humans, we're probably the only animal capable of contemplating our own mortality. Many say or think that, at the point of death, your whole life --- maybe only a part? -- flashes before your eyes. And who knows what you really see, anyway..? That's what this movie is all about: it provides a glimpse of what might have been going on inside Donnie's head in the brief few seconds before he dies when a 747 engine drops though the roof of his parents' house and lands on top of him. So, all that you see from the start of this movie until near the end is simply Donnie's (Jake Gyllenhaal) last thoughts for this earth. Very near the start of the story, Donnie has a vision, meeting a strange figure called Frank who tells him that his world is coming to an end. That's a clue that Donnie's dying but I didn't cotton onto that until much later in the plot...This narrative structure has been done at least once before that I know of: Jacob's Ladder (1990) had the story of a Vietnam soldier dying on an operating table. That story was again the soldier's weird thoughts before he succumbed to his wounds. If you haven't seen it, it is worth the time; but, it's quite a scary movie for some.I'd seen Gyllenhaal, for the first time, not so long ago in Jarhead (2005) a movie I didn't like but was much impressed by his acting. So, that's one of the reasons I saw this one: his intensity is once again at the forefront of all the characters in Donnie Darko.At another level, this movie is also partly about the American Dream and the lies that support it: there's the dream psychology coach Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), and what a ham he is, and very cunning to boot because he's got a nasty, dirty little secret; there's the idealistic English teacher Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) who's trying to open the students' minds to the delights of language  and gets more than she bargained for; there's the phys-ed coach Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) who wants her girls to win a national dancing competition, and will stop at nothing to get it; there's school principal Cole (David Moreland) who wants nothing more than peace, quiet, and all the metaphorical garbage kept out of public view; and finally there's Donnie's family, (see cast list), jaded, all mixed up, almost brain dead, and resigned to la dolce vita, or what passes for that each good morning, America.As Donnie, we learn from the story what might have happened had he lived, and as the final tune and final scenes play, what still might happen. Those final scenes are out of kilter with the whole thrust of the story (much like Jacob's Ladder, where the viewer knows what happens after the soldier dies  a narrative inconsistency) because Donnie's dead and the whole thing was his thoughts anyway. However, directors must cater for the viewer, tie up loose ends, and hope that nobody notices... But, heck, in a fantasy dressed up as science fiction, anything can happen, right? I really enjoyed this movie: good performances, snappy dialog, very effective cinematography, and quite funny in parts. Recommended.",8,2,4,5 March 2007

That's a clue that Donnie's dying but I didn't cotton onto that until much later in the plot...This narrative structure has been done at least once before that I know of: Jacob's Ladder (1990) had the story of a Vietnam soldier dying on an operating table. That story was again the soldier's weird thoughts before he succumbed to his wounds. If you haven't seen it, it is worth the time; but, it's quite a scary movie for some.I'd seen Gyllenhaal, for the first time, not so long ago in Jarhead (2005) a movie I didn't like but was much impressed by his acting. So, that's one of the reasons I saw this one: his intensity is once again at the forefront of all the characters in Donnie Darko.At another level, this movie is also partly about the American Dream and the lies that support it: there's the dream psychology coach Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), and what a ham he is, and very cunning to boot because he's got a nasty, dirty little secret; there's the idealistic English teacher Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) who's trying to open the students' minds to the delights of language - and gets more than she bargained for; there's the phys-ed coach Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) who wants her girls to win a national dancing competition, and will stop at nothing to get it; there's school principal Cole (David Moreland) who wants nothing more than peace, quiet, and all the metaphorical garbage kept out of public view; and finally there's Donnie's family, (see cast list), jaded, all mixed up, almost brain dead, and resigned to la dolce vita, or what passes for that each good morning, America.As Donnie, we learn from the story what might have happened had he lived, and as the final tune and final scenes play, what still might happen. Those final scenes are out of kilter with the whole thrust of the story (much like Jacob's Ladder, where the viewer knows what happens after the soldier dies - a narrative inconsistency) because Donnie's dead and the whole thing was his thoughts anyway. However, directors must cater for the viewer, tie up loose ends, and hope that nobody notices... But, heck, in a fantasy dressed up as science fiction, anything can happen, right?I really enjoyed this movie: good performances, snappy dialog, very effective cinematography, and quite funny in parts. Recommended. Eight out of ten.",8,0,0,2 February 2020
The Pursuit of Happyness," A kindler, gentlerjungle?
","I'd avoided this film because Will Smith, as an actor, did not impress me.Well, I was wrong about Will Smith: in this story, he showed that he could produce the goods.However, the story has been told so many times before: the down-and-nearly-out-hero who still manages to make it big against the odds, and with a young son in tow.Ho-hum...So, what's different (maybe the producer asked that question, too?)? Well, if the story is entirely true, Chris Gardner (Smith) got the door to wealth opened by solving the Rubick's Cube in front of his prospective employer, shortly after it came on the market in 1981. That's impressive: shows he could bring all his mental capacities into full force while under a lot of pressure. And, that was a well-done scene...The other well-done scene is when Gardner succeeds in his quest for a job: the mixed expressions on his face are exquisite, even down to just the trace of a tear in his eyes as he shakes hands with his new bosses.The rest of it is fairly pedestrian (no pun intended, as you will see) and predictable.The big failing is this story is that it equates being happy with having a lot of money and shamelessly uses Jefferson's words from the Declaration of Independence as support. As the hero says to his son (Smith's real son): 'Go get it!' Granted, money is needed to survive in most societies. Beyond that, and even as our hero admits, being happy is a condition that we all want, but which none ever achieve, absolutely. I would simply add that only the truly insane can hope to be happy! And that's a thought that crossed my mind as our hero entered the broker pit for the first time...an aspect that was done to death in the bleak and very macho world of Wall Street (1987).There are a few laughs, some tearjerker husband/wife scenes, and a bit about how the really destitute lived in San Franciso in the eighties.Was it worth a couple of hours of my time? Nah... but you might like it.",5,1,2,26 September 2007
Law Abiding Citizen," Any law abiding citizen should send this one to solitary
","I first saw Gerard Butler in Mrs Brown (1997), but didn't know it. I next saw him in Dear Frankie (2004) and The Phantom of the Opera (2004), both of which made me realize how good a performer he is.So this is the fourth time I've seen him. I wished I'd passed because this film is beyond belief, literally and figuratively. Butler did this one for the money, that's for sure: there can be no other reason for such a talented actor to waste his time, my time and my money.Where to start? Perhaps by saying: don't bother. Or – burn notice. Or – tell it to the Marines. Or – get Dexter to do a number on all copies. Or – don't ban nukes, ban this excuse for a movie. Or whatever turns you on...Because dear viewer, you'll go a long, long way before you see another movie that is worse. Why? Okay, here's what it's about: with a nod to Michael Winner's winning story about some guy's Death Wish(1974), Clyde Shelton (Butler) decides to avenge the cruel murder of his family by home invaders when justice is denied by a corrupt system and officials. He devises and sets in motion a ten – yes, TEN – year plan to wreak havoc, Armageddon-like, upon a system that must be destroyed to be made right. Talk about having patience, huh?But, it gets worse because, to get the ball rolling, Shelton has to get into prison. To do that, he starts murdering the bad guys who murdered his family. And, when being questioned in prison, he murders others while he's there. Because why? Because he's a solitary guy and wants to be left alone... To tell you more will reveal the whole fatuous reasoning behind Shelton's actions. So, if you really want to bring out the masochist in you, go see it. The better thing to do is to vote with your absence to send this movie to trash video and hope the producers lose a bundle. They deserve to.Because, in their desire to make a statement about the sorry state of the American criminal justice system, they have simply traded on the base machismo of an eye-for-an-eye theme and presented the whole thing seriously, instead of satirically. In doing so, they have, instead, prostituted the whole concept of justice – simply and simplistically – in an attempt to make abuck – or too many.Yes, it's that bad. If I could give a zero out of ten, I would. One is far too much. I've never said that before about any movie, but this one deserves it.",1,5,9,5 September 2010
The Island," Which goes to show that no man is an island, after all...
","I'll see any movie with Steve Buscemi in it.After twenty minutes, however, I was at the point of turning this one off: Buscemi still hadn't made his entrance; the setting, story and production were clinically confusing and seemed to be getting more so; and Ewan McGregor isn't an actor of much impact for me.Fortunately, in the next two minutes, everything changed after McCord (Buscemi) talks with our hero, Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) alerting the viewer  me  that all is not perfect in paradise... and the rest of the story unfolds, as it should. So, if you see this movie, be patient  it's meant to be confusing in those first twenty-two minutes.This is a story set in the future, presenting a scenario that is indeed possible, given the advances in genetics that we read about even today. The writers have simply extrapolated about a series of 'what-ifs' and allowed their fertile imaginations run riot.The result is an action packed  more than enough for most action freaks, I think  pulsating hunt for Lincoln Six and his friend, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), as they set off to find out the secret of The Island. Along the way, there are action sequences that bear strong resemblance to thrillers such as Terminator, Aliens and others, as the two dodge and weave to stay alive. The special effects when they are on a truck carrying railway gear and being chased by the bad guys is particularly well done.But, for me, the script is the part that shines, with some of the best repartee between characters I've heard for a long time  and for a very good reason, as you will see. Even in the midst of mayhem and death, there is always time for black humour...In addition, it the overall theme of this story that stays with me: the question of personal identity and what it means to be me. This is a fundamental issue, as I'm sure you appreciate, and it's one that this story explores with well-constructed logic, robust science (to a point) and mounting horror. If you come away from this story with a shrug of your shoulders, then maybe you've missed crucial news reports, over the last ten years or so, which explore advances and future trends in genetics.This is a clever story, well-produced and well-acted  and good entertainment to boot. And, it is worth the time to see.",8,0,2,13 October 2007
