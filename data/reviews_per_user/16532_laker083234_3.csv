United 93," The best movie so far this year and the most devastating movie this decade.
","This movie is not easy to sit through first and foremost. The same felling that overcame people who saw the Passion of the Christ could be felt here. The only thing different is that in the Passion of the Christ you felt manipulated into the feelings because of the blood and horror. This movie tells it like it was and you make your own feelings from the intense emotions on screen and in your self. The movie is made with great respect towards all those connected to that day. There is absolutely no exploitation going on and the movie has the respect not to offer any personal commentary on politics into it. United 93 chronicles the time that the flight was boarded to the tragic end. The movie cuts from the United flight to different Air Traffic Control centers and to the military control. Some of the high officials where kind enough to play them selves in the movie. There is no real star power which really helps make the movie feel even more realistic. You can tell while watching the film that the creators really took there time to fact-check many details to present it with much fascination info from behind the scenes. As I watched the film I could hear the sniffles, sobs, and other sad noises from the audience. The thing that amazed me is that no one in the theater left, nor did they make much noise in what I feel was much respect for the film and subject.If this film were released last year I would make the argument that it could have walked off with the Best Picture Oscar. While the events in the film were not that long ago and some might say that it is to soon, to that I say this film pays great honor to all those involved with that horrifying day and will inform more upon the tragic flight and the people behind the scenes trying to figure out what was going on. The movie is a heart breaking docudrama that with the up most responsibility accomplished a great feat in the history of film.(This movie covers September 11th through the air, look for Oliver Stones 'World Trade Center' movie in August that will tell the story of two police men from inside the World Trade Center ruble.)",10,8,17,28 April 2006
Terminator Salvation," Bale Spue over
","I keep hearing about the loss of what made the other films great. Well to me T3 was recycled garbage with no style and no excitement. And my fondest moments of T2 are the best action sequences in film history, the heart pounding suspense of the action scenes are what made that film great along with good humor. It was never really the story telling that made it classic even though it was good. If you believe it was you are lieing to your self. MCG does mess up somethings like the intro, but not the action. This is the best pure action movie in awhile. Many better action movies but not as dazzling in action sequences as this. Iron man on pure action left more to be desired and Dark knight is magnificent but still a little to grounded.This movie is the first since Transformers in which the action had me stunned. Not to mention the style is back. From the wasteland to Skynet the production is magnificent. Especially the last fight scene in Skynet with the T-800 (the colors and look are beautifully reminiscent of the steel mill from T2). Bottom line is that I critique movies very tough. But with all the great reminiscent moments and dazzling effects I don't see how this movie is being torn apart by reviews like it is. X-men Orgings was a mess and was a disgrace to X2. How is this movie in that same league I don't get it. There have been worse movies than how this is getting attacked. Bottom line is I love T2 and am proud to say this was a good movie of which I had a great time viewing and look forward to the sequels. Other than what I think the critiques can all go to hell. Right!!!",8,4,7,22 May 2009
Munich," A dark haunting Masterpiece! Not for everyone
","I have seen every big Oscar contender this year except for Capote and none have stuck with me like this. I must say this is not every ones type of movie: The violence is realistic and gruesome and the movie is politically charged but still is universal.I have seen Brokeback Mountain and it is very good but Munich is I believe harder to forget and just as good in the acting. I do want to comment on one thing, I saw Brokeback Mountian and this is why a movie of that type is important. I was verbally attacked by my father for seeing it. He joke with words of ashamed and disowned and started questioning my sexual preference. I am with out a doubt straight but it is because of people like my father movies like Brokeback must be made. It is an important movie and I hope people go see it to really see what an Ignorant society can do.But none the less movie wise Munich to me stands alone this year. The sad part is it could be knocked out of the Best Picture race because of how dark and off putting it is. Spielberg has told a story with unbelievable cinematography and at times a beautiful and painful score(music). The movie is made with such detail you can not help but admire the direction that went into this movie. Spielberg also takes the most risk he has ever taken with his movies. The subject matter is a hard sell, his violence is done in a gruesome and realistic way, his characters are not hero's and even hard just to like, the cast is not well known, he shoots it in an old fashion way with a lot of zooming, and he uses a sex scene to also reflect on the finale of the Munich massacre. All these risk are why the movie has been getting mixed reviews and the fact that no movie could live up to the expectations it had. These risk though is also why I love it so much, this is film making at it's bravest.The scene I referred to as a risk is probably the biggest punch in the whole movie. Avner the leader has been pulled out of the field and returned home to his wife. He is tormented and through out the film has had flash backs to the Munich massacre. He has sex with his wife who he has not seen in a long time. During it he is picturing the final massacre of the 9 remaining athletes at the airport. This is very powerful because it shows the torment of the main character while also hitting the audience with the spark that caused the mission. The unforgettable music playing during this heartbreaking scene makes it one I will remember for ever. The first time I saw it I felt numb and heartbroken. The second time a teen of my age either 18 or 19 years old laughed which really ruined this incredible scene.This is not a film for every one but if you are willing to go to the theater and see something new and important then I advise you too. It is informative and unforgettable.My personal top ten of the year excluding Capote 1. Munich 2. Good Night and Good Luck 3. King Kong 4. Syriana 5. Brokeback Mountain 6. Cinderella Man 7. Crash 8. Walk the Line 9. A History of Violence 10. Jarhead",10,13,23,8 January 2006
