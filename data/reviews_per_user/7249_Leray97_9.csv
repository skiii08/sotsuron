Hereditary," Extremely overrated
","I do think that seeing so many rave reviews for Hereditary raised my personal expectations because I walked out of the theater feeling perplexed as to how people could compare this film to the likes of The Shining or Suspiria and how so many people were genuinely disturbed by it. Hereditary definitely borrows a few elements from the aforementioned films but I myself wouldn't place it anywhere near the two classics. The sound design is really the only redeeming factor I can think of in this film. While the soundtrack and sound bits aren't anything we've never heard of before, hearing the foreboding tunes and heavy ambient music did help in forcing the me into the right mood. The way they were used as accents to outline a 'scary' scene was obviously a big focus for the filmmakers.The cinematography was also good, especially for having so many indoor scenes. At a glance, the visuals make Hereditary seem like an art-house horror type of film, which it either isn't entirely or doesn't even know if it wants to be. The movie, as a whole, looks like it should be really good but in the context of style vs substance, there isn't enough substance to complement the style, in my opinion. There are already so many films with exceptional cinematography and this one is no standout in any way.I wasn't a big fan the acting either; at best, I'd say it was serviceable for a horror. The scare factor in a lot of horror flicks can be predicated on the actors, by whether or not they can sell their performance in a crazy scene. In this regard, I think Toni Collette is the best part of the entire cast of Hereditary. On the flipside, I just couldn't take Alex Wolff seriously. There are times where his character has to portray some extreme emotions but I just couldn't connect with him. The way he would cry or whimper at times would really take me out of the moment and completely cut all the tension away from what was causing him to feel that way.I've said 'horror' many times throughout this review because my vocabulary and syntax could use some work and also because Hereditary is labeled as one. I know horror is another one of the subjective genres but I fail to see how anyone could walk away from this film feeling truly disturbed. There are really only a couple moments of disturbing imagery in the film but outside those instances, I never felt anxious or tense. That's not to say that I'm some macho man because I'm not, but there was even a few times during Hereditary where some people in my auditorium actually laughed. I'm not a horror aficionado but I don't think one such film that is stylized like Hereditary should be making the audience laugh. The fact that this movie isn't free of some of the usual horror film cliches doesn't help, either.This is probably too long of a review from someone who isn't well versed in the horror genre but I just didn't enjoy Hereditary like everyone else did, and I'm not special for that. To the people who have watched already it, I personally think the last minute or so of the film should have been cut.",2,5,12,29 June 2018
Barry Lyndon," One of the most beautiful looking films ever made
","I can't get over how incredible this film's cinematography is. It's such an easy thing to point out when watching it but what John Alcott, (the cinematographer) has done for this movie is something that really elevates the whole thing to a different level, one that is unparalleled by many films today. The use of Steadicam in Kubrick's The Shining is something I'll always remember so fondly of but that technology wasn't even invented by the 70's. Instead, Barry Lyndon showcases numerous sequences depicting the lush countryside-esque landscape that the story is set in and makes use of natural lighting in both indoor and outdoor scenes. It's important to note the indoor parts as the visuals for the interior scenes also look amazing and detailed. Many of the scenes that take place in a house or some building are lit by candles, which would easily be a detriment to the visuals but works well in this case. Pausing the film during these moments of great cinematography would be the same thing as looking at a painting because they really resembled the looks of an actual piece. The framing, with its double shots and closeups, are also nothing short of perfection, as they keep the focus on the subjects whenever necessary while being mindful of the background.The story of Barry Lyndon is essentially a man's journey from rags to riches. Having this premise also be a period piece can be challenging because it imposes a lot of standards on the audience to believe in to be able to fully enjoy the film. I really liked it though, and this has to do with the presentation. I've said enough about the cinematography but the music and acting are also deserving of the praise they receive. I myself don't have a favorite actor or performance from this film because I felt like all of them kind of blended together and helped with the overall world-building, which is good.Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this film also has an intermission, which I appreciated. Barry Lyndon is three hours long, and while I very much enjoyed the film in its entirety, I did feel the runtime by the time it was over. This also has to do with how the second part of the movie slows down, as it's in charge of steering the story towards the end. The intermission got me thinking a bit about modern films, especially because ones that are 2.5+ hours long are going to be made for as long as film exists. I definitely wouldn't mind having intermissions for newer movies and I'm curious as to why we don't really see them anymore. It's one thing to absorb everything that's happening on screen in one long sitting but making a film built around segmented parts with an intermission might make for a more easier movie-going experience these days. Having a short pause midway though might help the audience take a minute to reflect on everything that's happened and that's definitely something I did while watching Barry Lyndon which prepared me for the rest of the film.One of Kubrick's best, but The Shining is still my favorite. Thank god for John Alcott.",9,3,5,29 June 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The start of an epic and memorable journey
","At 3 hours and 20 minutes (I watched the extended version), The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring initiates what might be the best cinematic fantasy trilogy I'm ever going to see. The runtime of this film and its two sequels have turned me off from watching them for years; I knew that they would be epics that took their time to develop the LOTR world and lore, and I was prepared for this film to drain all of my energy for the day. I'm definitely a bit tired, but it was worth it. Despite this film being backed up by its own source material, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring presents a fantasy that doesn't feel too whimsical but very accessible for the audience. Frodo's character arc and the overall plot of this film are easy to follow and very rewarding of any investment made by the viewer.It's actually hard to believe how well this movie turned out, given the state of filmmaking on a technological standpoint during the late 90's to the early 2000's. Of course, times weren't that primitive back then but to tell a story like The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring does is demanding; the filmmmakers had to establish a world, it's regions, the characters and their associations (basically, the lore), all in a way that wouldn't completely confuse the viewer. Whether it be by narration, verbal exposition (which usually isn't so great to sit through except in this case), or heavy CGI, I believe that everyone involved in the making of this film succeeded in creating a fictional world that the audience can immerse themselves into and enjoy the ride.Fantasies are usually lighthearted in nature, but The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring doesn't skimp out on the more emotional moments, as they are so vital to the character arcs. It details all the aspects of the trials and tribulations that Frodo (as well as the rest of the fellowship) has to go through to attempt to save Middle-Earth, thus creating a more well rounded story instead of a one-and-done kind of adventure.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has many great character performances as well. Maybe it's his gigantic blue eyes, but Elijah Wood nailed his emotional and dramatic scenes. As Frodo is caught in the middle of this situation, he's overwhelmed for the most part and Wood does a solid job in portraying the emotions needed. I really liked Viggo Mortensen in this film, his character was the rock that I could fall back on when things were heating up and that definitely has to do with Mortensen's acting prowess, at least in portraying a character like Strider.Even on its own, The Fellowship of the Ring creates a fantasy world that the audience can easily immerse themselves into and makes for an incredible experience with the characters that we get to know and love.",9,1,1,29 June 2018
The Shining," One of Kubrick's best
","The Shining is the best horror film I've ever watched and one of my favorite films of all time. In this genre, it is unparalleled in vision, atmosphere, and class.I was constantly wondering what his style of film making would turn out to be. Though because of how mysterious the premise of The Shining is, I can't say I've really learned much in that department other than the fact that Stanley Kubrick was definitely influenced by some of David Lynch's earlier works, which is awesome. This is not a bad thing though, that I didn't learn much, as the mystery of this film along with its endless possibilities for theories is what makes it so timeless and engaging. Even with its 2.5 hour runtime, I never felt drained by the end, in fact I was left with more questions I had going in. I love that this movie never gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing exactly what's going on. Much of the film feels like amusement art, where we're immersed into the world of the characters, enveloped in realism and tension. I say realism because one of the core themes of The Shining is about family. This makes way for many dialogue sequences that don't really seem like they are just the 'what you see in the movies' type of thing. Because they can seem real, the story, at times, feels more grounded and personal.Even on a surface level, The Shining is such a well-made, perplexing cinematic masterpiece. Without even trying to further read into the plot, The Shining is already one of those slow but unsettling festivals of tension that effectively utilizes music and cinematography to captivate the audience every second of the way. Everyone who has praised this movie has talked about the cinematography, and I'm going to do it here again. It's amazing. The use of the Steadicam camera stabilizer along with the intense score made the tension so powerful and the film so visually appealing.Of course, I can't forget about Jack Nicholson. I haven't seen many of the movies he has starred in so this was definitely a sight to behold. Aside from the fact that he gives many great performances throughout the film, he just knows how to demand screen presence. My attention was always on him when he was on camera; he really has a way of 'face acting' that helps the viewer kind of piece together what is going on inside his head. As far as acting goes in general, it doesn't get much better than this guy. In fact, as far as movies go, it doesn't get much better than this one either.",10,0,2,29 June 2018
Dark City," Undeservedly underrated
","With Blade Runner and The Matrix as Hollywood's two crowning achievements in its long line of misrepresentations of the cyberpunk genre in film, it seems like Dark City has been buried into obscurity for not being like the former, at least to the mainstream audience. It shouldn't be this way; while this film certainly isn't as stylish as the other two, Dark City presents a very cool take on the usual 'what's real and what isn't?' idea that's usually seen in these cyberpunk sci-fi films. Going into any major detail of the its story would be stepping into spoiler territory but by the end of the film, I really was enraptured by its direction despite its execution (in style).A cyberpunk themed film's visuals is going to be one of its most important traits. The expected aspects are usually going to be something along the lines of holograms besides skyscrapers and neon lights enveloping the darkened city inhabited by people who were big trench-coats. Unfortunately, this isn't entirely the case in Dark City. Because of the overall story, the film will often look murky and just not pretty to look at (definitely not the best looking movie to watch during the daytime). Fight scenes are never fun to watch when it's hard to see anything that's happening; this film's darkened colors combined with the jerky camerawork during these sequences made them feel disorienting for me. At least this isn't an action movie on any major level. I was half expecting the filmmakers to make use of lights in some unique way, shape, or form to counteract the sheer darkness of the visuals but it never really happened. I'm not unhappy with this overall result though, due to the story's demands and possible budget constraints.Another popular cyberpunk attribute that isn't prevalent in Dark City is the music. It might be too much to ask this film to use the 80's style synthwave sound but seeing how it was released in 1998 and Blade Runner, having been released much earlier, featured a great synth soundtrack, I wish the filmmakers made the music a bigger priority here.The character performances were just okay. I only feel the need to mention the acting because I wanted a good segue to talk about how great Jennifer Connelly looks here: she looked great, maybe the budget for the lighting went towards her scenes. Kiefer Sutherland does this weird thing where he constantly breaks off his speech after every two to three words; I know this should be in reference to his character's frantic state of mind or something but it was annoying nonetheless.On questioning reality in a film, there are definitely better ways to do it and there are also worse ways. Dark City's take on this subject is both accessible and layered enough to make it undeserving of the negligence directed towards it these past years. It's definitely underrated but the film just isn't able to capitalize well enough on its own narrative unlike Blade Runner and The Matrix. Although if Hollywood were looking to remake another classic (and God knows they definitely are), I think Dark City could be a prime subject given its concept and prior restrictions.",7,1,1,29 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," The biggest crossover in film
","The Russo Brothers have showed that they can go beyond the comic book movie genre and they've done it again. Despite the great moments it has, Avengers: Infinity War isn't a perfect film, as much as I would like it to be.The action was cool; it was a big showcase of all the different fighting styles throughout the battles. The fact that there are just so many characters in this film hinders the possibility of each character really showing off their skills. For example, Captain America was shown to have new shields in the trailers so I was looking forward to seeing him use them to fight off the alien army but it barely happens. There is always time spent to show off Tony Stark's new tech though, and seeing him fight with them was fun as they are always so inventive with Iron Man's abilities.The MCU has always had trouble with creating and defining a villain along with their motives. So many of them are forgettable and seem dull and uninspired even though they come from their own source material. Thanos is the exception though, if there is one baddie in the MCU that anyone will remember, it's clearly going to be this guy. He had a lot more screen time than I was expecting. Much of the good that comes out of the Thanos character is also brought in by Josh Brolin, giving many great performances and having a great voice for a big villain. James Spader's motion capture in Avengers: Age of Ultron wasn't bad in my eyes but the way they did it for Brolin's Thanos in this film was much better. It seemed more natural; the facial expressions never looked weird and were actually pretty clear. I almost forgot Thanos wasn't alone though, as he also had The Black Order on his side. Unfortunately these allies were somewhat forgettable; the roles they play are very sparse and I don't actually remember their names ever being said at any point in the movie. I myself only knew who they were because I had done research on them a while ago so I can only imagine how the more casual enjoyers of the MCU films felt when they saw these secondary villains pop up seemingly out of nowhere.Like many other people, I've seen the previous MCU films so I already know the main characters. In this case I was just anticipating some fun interactions with different characters and seeing them team up. One of my favorites came from the dynamic between Tony Stark and Stephen Strange. They're similar in various ways and seeing them finally be in each other's presences was interesting to watch. It also helps that RDJ and Benedict Cucumber are great actors themselves and help make the interactions as fun and/or serious as they are. I was saddened to see how little Steve Rogers and T'challa were used in this film, since they should be a part of the Avengers's frontline. I feel like the filmmakers didn't know just how successful 'Black Panther' was going to be or else we probably would have seen him more throughout Avengers: Infinity War. Sure, Wakanda is an important setting for the film's overall story but the major characters from there just aren't used as much. Tom Holland's Spider-Man is always a joy to watch, as well as Dave Bautista's Drax with his dry humor. As we've seen from Thor: Raganarok, Chris Hemsworth is more than capable in pulling off the humorous side in Thor but I was much more pleased seeing him in battle. I'm also a big fan of Elizabeth Olsen so I was happy to see she'd pretty much lost the Sokovian accent and also just looked great in and out of costume. I also want to mention that I did not like the way the filmmakers handled Gamora in this movie.The music in Avengers: Infinity War is interesting, and not in a good way. There's a YouTube video entitled 'The Marvel Symphonic Universe' that details the use of orchestral scores in MCU films. The point of the video was to say that a lot of the music put in to these movies can sound so generic and very forgettable. It's not so different in this case, I probably won't be dying to listen to the film's soundtrack anytime soon. Some people have mentioned that this along with the fact that a portion of Avengers: Infinity War takes place in space makes it feel like Star Wars, in terms of being a type of space opera. This aspect can take away a bit from the overall atmosphere for those people, especially if they're are very familiar with John Williams's scores.I'm definitely a bit partial to the MCU films, as they provided me with a lot of fun moments in the past years. However, as fun as they are, their prolific nature in the film industry can be concerning. Disney and Marvel are constantly growing in size and stature with these movies and it has no doubt had an effect on Hollywood in its attempts to create more cinematic universes and big blockbusters. The culture of making entirely original and meaningful films that don't pander to the audience's expectations is not as prevalent anymore and that is due to companies such as Disney and Marvel.It's hard to keep expectations reasonable for a movie like this; there is a lot on the line and so much has been done to achieve this state in the MCU. For the most part, Avengers: Infinity War delivers on many things especially in producing some cheers and gasps from the audience. I've never once cried during a movie but I felt a little something happening in my tear glands during the final 10 minutes. Was the six years worth the wait? Considering everything that happened and the fact that the dust hasn't even settled yet, I'd say it was.",8,1,3,29 June 2018
A Quiet Place," Another overrated modern 'horror'
","A Quiet Place plays on the incredibly banal horror movie cliche where the absence of sound in a scene paves way for some jump-scares. Not only does the shock value increase in a movie like this, where the premise is built around not making any noise for extended amounts of time, it also helps with storytelling. Because there is little dialogue, the audience's focus is often times directed completely towards the characters: what they say, how they're saying it, their facial expressions when doing certain things, and any other things of the sort. In other words, it's a visual experience, and possibly a visceral one for some people. As a horror movie, it definitely had thrills but was it really THAT scary? Horror, of course, is subjective but I'll say this: A Quiet Place is rated PG-13, allowing for a more diverse age demographic of moviegoers and not once during my viewing along with a packed auditorium did I hear any screaming or outcries.Of course, the best (and quite frankly the only good) performances came from Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, with Blunt being the top dog between the two. It has been said by John Krasinski (not in his exact words) that his intention for this movie was to portray the somewhat primal desire to protect one's family. His success in doing so came from the fact that he and Emily Blunt have a family of their own, and were able to resonate with the story. This is why their performances were as good as they were. As a film about family, this one had a cool take on the protection of loved ones.",2,1,3,29 June 2018
Mulholland Drive," Mastery in surrealism; one of, if not Lynch's' best film
","And here I thought Inception was the best dream related movie I've ever seen.. Mulholland Drive easily takes the cake given how the plot is structured. From a general standpoint, no other film has left such a lasting impact on me like Mulholland Drive; it's dreamlike story which also boasts some unique horror elements have not left my mind since I've watched it and probably won't ever do so, which I'm not entirely opposed to.Lynchian visuals are always going to be one of the highlights of any Lynch film. In this case, the way light bounces off figures in certain long takes/sequences along with the ambient music masterfully composed by Angelo Badalamenti created a very dreamlike atmosphere. Almost whimsical in a way, but definitely foreboding in other aspects. Speaking of dreams, its just so impressive how David Lynch is able to completely blur the line between dreams and reality in this movie. For a fair portion of the film we're given fragments of a story then led to believe and care for it up until we as the audience are taken by surprise and given another narrative. The specific plot elements Lynch chooses to flip are so unexpected and thus more appreciated as well. However much we accept or reject the 'new' reality is ultimately up to us but in the end, Lynch's message is a bit more clear. A film director who has a very specific idea for a story and sticks to it all the way through is deserving of all the praise they can get, especially when done in a successful fashion such as Mulholland Drive.The two biggest schools of thought about films are that they should either be politically and/or socially significant in its portrayal of certain relevant ideas or that films should depict a 'magical' world that the viewer can immerse themselves into for a while and think on the experience afterwards. I didn't watch Mulholland Drive much more than I felt it. It's hard to contextualize my ideas because not only do I have almost no idea about what I'm saying, Lynch seems to favor the style of film making that's aimed towards making the audience feel things upon losing themselves in Lynch's world. From him using cinema to dig into the audience's psyche, I'm not surprised that some people can dislike this movie just as others, myself included, will absolutely love it and the idea of it.",10,11,17,29 June 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An end to the best fantasy trilogy of all time(?)
","With the four hour conclusion that is The Return of the King, the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to a close. When it comes to film franchises, this fantasy series easily takes the cake for being the best one out there. The visual effects aren't the best, nor is the acting, but the story makes for such an experience that is so easy to become emotionally invested in. Part of the success that the story achieves comes from its execution as the writing caters to the whimsical side of adventuring as well as the more darker themes that involve Sauron and the One Ring. Another aspect of the story's successful execution has to do with how much care is given into each of the characters. There's obviously one overarching plot that involves everyone, but that itself is not the sole focus of the story. In the end, the LOTR trilogy feels like a big journey due to the audience gradually learning more and more about all the relevant characters and their motives.With their long runtimes, each film in the trilogy takes its time to fully establish the setting and flesh out its characters, as they should for being epics. I honestly can't imagine watching the theatrical versions now, seeing as the extended versions put in the much needed additional time to develop secondary characters. Though the more I think about it, I'm not too sure exactly how much this particular film benefits from having an extra 30 minutes in its runtime. Where Fellowship of the Ring benefited from the extra minutes in world building and the extended version of Two Towers slightly faltered in its pacing, The Return of the King is already going to be charged with wrapping everything up so I don't know what scenes the filmmakers would have prioritized over others. Either way, the tone of this film is so fitting for this grand adventure that I won't think about it too much.There's a lot of closure in the film, the character arcs that have been developed throughout the three films all come to a close and I can safely say that every minute I spent watching these movies were worth it. I really enjoyed Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) arc; seeing him develop as a leader and a reliable person made him my favorite character overall. Besides Frodo and Sam, I think Aragorn also has the most screen time out of all the films.Anyone who reveres the LOTR trilogy for its masterful storytelling and world-building is right to do so. It's probably the only set of films to tell such a story in all the right ways. Experiencing this trilogy in the theaters must have been a life changing point in many people's lives; I'm sure that if I was part of the fandom back then, my love for movies would have grown much sooner.",9,0,0,29 June 2018
