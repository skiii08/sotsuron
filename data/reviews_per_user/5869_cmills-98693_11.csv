Hereditary," A slow burner that fizzles out.
","I went into Hereditary hearing all the hype saying it was the next 'The Exorcist', unfortunately, it just wasn't.The pacing at the beginning is insanely slow, almost snails pace, and you're expecting a 'Wicker Man' style of film where the ending is the big payoff and you're held with a sense of dread winding around you, but the ending is somewhat of a misfire.
The whole 'hell worshiping cult' idea is pretty played out by now, so if you're going to do it it HAS to be a totally fresh take, and this just isn't.
I called about 15 minutes after the 'lucky' arrival of the other wounded grieving stranger that she had an ulterior motive and low and behold, they're worshipping the kings of hell.
While the cinematography and sound mixing is excellent, and the cast are superb (Toni Collette is standout) the story itself feels like it's lacking. There are unnerving moments, and moments that are harrowing, but at no point watching Hereditary did I feel the same terror that The Exorcist, The Wicker Man (1973) or The Blair Witch Project delivered.Hereditary attempts to shake up the horror genres use of cults and rituals but unfortunately falls short, relying on strong individual moments and performances to keep it on screens.",5,3,6,16 June 2019
John Wick," A strong action series debut.
","John Wick (1) is a good debut for a fantastic series. While certainly lacking in the panache of its two successors, John Wick does what it needs to (mindless gun toting madness) to be enjoyable, if a little routine.",6,0,0,24 June 2019
Fight Club," A film that will last the ages, and whatever comes of humanity, Fight Club will have predicted it long ago.
","Fight Club enters into the VERY elite group of films that have surpassed the novel from which they are drawn. While the book is a great read and still hold the reader in a death grip it can at times be confusing and the lead to the finale tricky to follow. Whereas the film is impossible to look away from. It's grit and acid strong taste juxtapose it's dark comedy and aggressive realism. I truly believe along with may others, that what has been birthed here is arguably, the greatest film ever made, and certainly in the top ten. 
With phenomenal performances from both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, alongside Helena Bonham Carter playing an evermore enthralling Marla Singer Fight Club is a film for the world, and whatever the fate of humanity in the years to come Fight Club will still be here, still be relevant and we will still be saying, I know this, because Tyler knows this.",10,0,0,21 May 2018
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man 2 is the blueprint for every superhero movie and was the first perfect superhero film.
","Spider-Man 2 is undoubtedly the best in the Sam Rami trilogy, but if you expand outward to include any superhero film, including Nolan's Dark Knight series, new era DC and the entire MCU, there are only a handful of films in the superhero genre you would describe as 'perfect'. Only a few you would change nothing about and could not be improved at all, and Sam Ramis Spider-Man 2 was the very first.Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius is the perfect villain, with a tragic path to villainy and a strong motivation as an evil individual and a powerful character arc throughout.Tobey Maguire puts in his best performance as the webslinger and brings real emotion to the role, really being able to portray the pitfalls of leading a double life and the toll it takes on Peters family and personal life, an angle that the next two generations of Spider-Man movies haven't been able to do properly.The plot is expertly balanced with the action and the slower more intimate moments and doesn't suffer from any pacing issues that have been a pitfall of many superhero movies.Spider-Man 2 is with a doubt the first perfect superhero movie, and has become the formula for so many films that have followed in its footsteps.",10,1,6,27 June 2019
Event Horizon," Don't store your directors cut in a salt mine.
","After watching it is clear that an extended, gorier directors cut is exactly what Event Horizon needs to push it into the really great category. Unfortunately while this cut did exist, they stored it in a salt mine in Europe and it rotted away, meaning that the only cut available now is the 95 minute normal one. While good at times and psychological at times, it reminded me more of a very tame Hellraiser as opposed to its own individual entity.Still a strong movie and a great sci-fi/horror crossover.",6,0,0,2 November 2019
Midsommar," A psychedelic trip to a Swedish wicker man.
","Midsommar is beautiful.It is a gruesome, gritty, visceral tale of a ill-fated Swedish getaway and delivers gore aplenty but unfortunately it doesn't quite deliver fear.I felt uneasy at times, and I felt tense at times, but at no time during the 150 min run time did I feel afraid. The scenes of horror are disgusting rather than fear-inducing which is by no means a bad thing, but the moments that are supposed to be scary with no gore seem to miss their mark.
I enjoyed the uneasy feel that grows at the start but it seems to falter towards the middle, and while the end tried to deliver the explosive finale like that in 'Hereditary' or 'The Wicker Man', there are sequences in the middle that really need you to stick with it and risk losing a lot of people due to the pacing.Ari Aster tells a chilling tale of dealing with loss, breakup and realising the damage of a toxic relationship. The themes of release and letting go that Dani is forced to accept are brutal and it drugs the audience into a psychedelic trance alongside the cast.All that said, what it does, it does beautifully, with some astounding performances and some truly disgusting moments that make even the most hard stomached cinema-goer experience a slight twinge. I enjoyed watching Midsommar, and even with the feeling that it left the possibility of an even scarier movie out in the field, you're not in any way dissatisfied with the end product.Midsommar needs to be experienced.Enjoy the festivities.",8,38,77,6 July 2019
Joker," A masterclass in acting, sound mixing and cinematography.
","Without a doubt, Joker is in contention for the film of the year.With Joachin Phoenix garnering praise left and right for Joker it's easy to dismiss the multiple other elements of direction, sound mixing, editing, cinematography, set and costume design and casting that make this a truly astounding piece of artistic cinema.
Joker is a film that without any one of these elements, it would fail. It would slip into the same bracket as Suicide Squad and be forgotten, but, fail it certainly does not.Joachin Phoenix is phenomenal. We know this already from pictures like Her and The Master, what we didn't know was how utterly deep and broad his range was. At points, I was totally absorbed by Joker. For the first time in possibly 10 years the movie theatre melted away, along with other viewers and noises and I was a part of that film. It was as if I was watching a documentary, rather than a fictional work. His commitment to the role, his weight loss and mental strain are dangerous but it produces something that no one ever thought would happen. It produces a performance that could genuinely rival Heath Ledgers.Todd Phillips direction and script are masterstrokes. If it were a painting it would be a Turner, with bright violent skies, and dark sad landscapes. His beautiful melting pot of inspiration features large doses of Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', alongside the physiological battery acid from more recent pictures such as Fight Club and Black Swan.
It swirls together to birth this bitter, gritty, dark, mesmerising masterpiece, that both requires and demands, multiple, in-depth viewings.For me, what makes this film is the costume design and the cinematography. The design of every minute detail on each character to make Gotham look even more drab and dull, even more grimy and beaten down is exceptional. Similar to how Scorsese made Harlem and The Bronx look broken and corrupted in Taxi Driver, you feel physically dirty after watching numerous sequences and you feel pangs of genuine social guilt stemming from your own moments of awful selfishness.
The cinematography is astounding, and MUST be in contention for an Academy Award, alongside Best Lead, Best Direction and best Sound Mixing. Some of the shots could have been lifted from a Time Magazine piece on 'City Life' they're that artistically powerful. Whole, dialogue-free sequences that say far more with silence and sounds of a city teetering on the brink of oblivion in the background than anyone could ever say. The sound mixing to have conversations, telephones, car horns, shouting, trains prevalent in the background audio leaking into the foreground does what Nolan did in 'Dunkirk' and pushes further the feeling of strain. The idea that even noise is seeping in from the city and soon the barricade will break and it'll drown us all in it's filth, corruption and decadence.Joker is a true masterpiece. So dark, so dirty, so vindictive of a modern flawed and broken societal system, but it always reminds you:
Put on a happy face.",9,72,150,7 October 2019
Prometheus," An interesting reboot
","Prometheus breathes new life into a series that has been laying dormant for a long while. 
While by no means a perfect film, what Prometheus brings is a new aspect rather than the usual horror supplied by previous Alien films. A new approach and plot lines rather than the frequently used 'survive' goal of the usual rag-tag group. 
Visually, Prometheus is beautiful to see, the usual Ridley Scott visual masterpiece is supported by the Hollywood weight of Fassbender and Idris Elba in strong roles. However the film is not without issue, some small but niggly plot holes and some perculiar story progression at points can lead to confusion or possibly irritation at flaws. 
Overall Prometheus is a strong piece of cinema. Weaving science fantasy with horror and development of a horror icon. A good step as a prequel, leaving a lot of tantalising doors open for the next film to explore.",9,1,2,17 March 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Pretty much the perfect sequel.
","John Wick 1 was a good debut for an interesting character who has a world of depth and a million plot lines, Chapter 2 does excellently to not pick a dull and generic one.With Keanu Reeves absolutely SHREDDING with Taran Tactical you know you're in for a treat but this movie more than delivers. The introduction of Laurence Fishburn and the return of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick Male chapter 2 not only AMAZINGLY well cast but perfectly balanced.The only fault with this film is one that is entirely on personal taste. I didn't really rate the bulletproof suit addition, I liked that his skill was what stopped him getting shot, but the bulletproof suit then means he can have some cooler and more visually rewarding fights without 'total' suspension of reality.Overall Chapter 2 is far superior to 1, and is building to make the John Wick franchise into one of the most promising action series currently around.",9,1,1,24 June 2019
Annihilation," A visual masterpiece, but almost totally void of content.
","Annihilation is beautiful, but unfortunately is almost completely without any meaningful plot or takeaway.If you want a film so beautiful, that at times you forget that vast swathes of plot haven't been explained then Annihilation is for you.
I'm still not quite sure what the point of this film is because after watching, there seemed to be huge focus on the backstory of the main couple that has no payoff whatsoever and huge gaps in the explanation of what is actually happening.Annihilation is very similar to Alien: Covenant in that if this was just a safari through this make-believe world it'd be a smash hit, but unfortunately it was supposed to be a film and if falters at the first hurdle of needing a good and enticing plot. In the same way that Alien: Covenant seems to make lazy plot decisions, Annihilation cleverly avoids that mistake, by making no plot decisions whatsoever and leaves you with a very pretty but fairly dull end product.The big twist ending and the ham fisted ethical questions are laid on so thick that at points they're almost annoying, and some of the acting certainly towards the end is downright cringeworthy. Tessa Thompson's natural charisma is massively underused and her character almost has no point in being there.All of the 'discoveries' made by the team have no lead up or progression, they just happen and have no pushback from anyone else giving you the impression that even the writers themselves didn't actually understand what they were writing. Strange events just happen and then are either forgotten or flogged to death to make a very flimsy point that in the end don't matter because the final 10 minutes is so unbelievably bad that you don't care.Annihilation is like finding your favourite sweet in a Christmas selection box, and then realising it just an empty wrapper.",3,4,7,28 July 2019
Alien: Covenant," Pretty on the outside, but hollow and lacking within.
","As a visual spectacle alone Covenant is superb, however the problem arises when you actually start watching it.
As a statement of how the xenomorph came to exist it's cheap and very easy. With predictable ending twists, even more irritating story lines, and it commits the worst mistake a sci-fi movie can make; it's boring.
As a film that follows the mission of the Prometheus to discover mankind's creators, to then completely discard this element of story and go a different way feels disappointing and totally lazy.
One of the best looking, but structurally flawed and utterly hollow entries into the Alien franchise and a disappointment to all cinema goers.",2,2,2,17 March 2018
