Blade Runner 2049," Just don't
","This is 2 hours and 45 minutes of your life you'll never get back. Both me and my friends were thrilled when the movie was over. Over-hyped and plain old boring movie. I would rather tell people to watch paint dry. Skip this movie, you won't miss anything. It might be a great movie if you're out of this world high on several drugs, but i really doubt that as well.",1,29,62,14 October 2017
