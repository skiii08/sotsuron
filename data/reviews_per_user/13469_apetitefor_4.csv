The Incredible Hulk," It is not incredible but its still a hulk
","As first words, I want to say that when I saw that this movie production involves the name of Edward Norton I was like a machine that is trying to combine two chemical mixtures that just can fit each other. The biggest problem for me was to overcome the prospect to see someone like Norton(who is really a magnificent actor) to start in a movie like that. It was truly a challenge for him and for us- the movie fans. But it all ended being good, like the happy ending we used to see in most of the movies. First of all Norton really fitted in the role, he was good, presenting to the public the complex figure of Bruce Banner- the big green guy.Because portraying a super hero is truly a hard job to do. Even if you are a fan of the particular monster, spider or something else. Maybe the biggest drawback of this movie was that you just can't enjoy the full power of the Hulk. Most of the scenes were really great, the special effects were on its top level, but still the battle's were short. Maybe because there were so intense that i didn't followed the passing time, I don't know, but it just felt like that. In conclusion this movie is far from being incredible, but its still worth to watch. And for most of the Marvel fans, there is maybe a surprise that you would enjoy at the end. But you have to watch at first! ;)",8,2,5,12 July 2008
Cloverfield," Really Good
","An amazing movie! Original, full of unknowing segments which can stop your heart out and most of all- done with a lot of thinking and analyzing how a person can react in dangerous situations. It's not just the crazy action scenes where the American soldiers fire at the monster and the guy with the camera is trying to take cover, giving you the chance to experience something that has never been done before in the world of cinema. It gives you the preview of normal daily life with a bunch of people who are throwing a party for their best friend who is going to somewhere and you don't want to loose contact with him. And everything goes on and on, until suddenly the reality strikes you and last but not least, fear is contacting in you in a full circle of madness.As final words, I don't want to spoil anything for you, I just strongly recommend you this movie, done by a real genius, who knows how, when and where to put his big sack of money. And truly he should be taken as an example of how can you do an amazing job, without wasting cash on something that has been already seen. 9/10 By the way I'm giving 9 out of 10, because there were some parts which i really didn't like- for example the way the monster is showing up . Its true that it can be seen from another side, like who cares, this is the real world, this is really happening, a monster is coming, so i don' t have time to read news or something like that.But, it would have been cooler and more satisfying to have hidden- mini introduction of the terror. Again, this could be a hint, a step for another sequel, and if there is... ooo I'm going to watch it, definitely. :)",9,1,3,6 April 2008
The Illusionist," 11 out of 10
","This movie is worth watching, and you have to see every amazing, glamors piece of it. The plot is really well putted, and filled with heart-stopping elements which will masterminds your soul every time you think you've finally discovered the secrets of The Illusionist. Edward Norton is again at its best. He is proving to the audience and the critics that if you are really an amazing actor, all you need to do is show to the public no more then twice in a year. This is a level which Leonardo Di Caprio and Johnny Depp can put. I think the supporting actors were also well chosen, because I haven seen a human being that didn't fit into its role right. Even the servant of the emperor, he was really looking like one, his clothes,every tiny piece of element, was so mathematically well put, that most of the time I was just trying to overcome the fact, that I am watching a movie, which hasn't really made a mistake. Some words should be spoken about the soundtrack also. It was again, well fitted into the whole atmosphere into the movie, and it was also enough effecting, so the audience won't have a slip of breath to use until its genius end. I can really say that this movie is not just worth to be watched, but it should be added to every DVD or at least a fan movie, or at least guy who is using his television, not just as a cupboard. Truly amazing, classy, and a must-have, for everyone, even for you, unbelievers.11 out of 10!",10,1,2,4 May 2008
Hancock," Could have been better
","Hancock is a really interesting movie.It presents your ordinary superhero with his amazing abilities to fly, kick and fight with the bad guys, but in a different kind of view. The main idea of it is to show you that even the one that are chosen to be great, to be amazing, to protect us, can still have problems, which are by the way human like - drinking, failed marriages etc.Most of the time you will enjoy the jokes Hancock is dropping, because they are just the old fashioned way. It seem to me that the producer didn't want to risk with something really extravagant, because the script was already jumping on the line of fondness and dislike. And maybe this is one of the main drawbacks, because there is no bad guy, that has a beef with Hancock, actually there is no motive at all, there is no movement that can give you the idea that our problematic superhero has an opponent. Although Theron seems to show in really pragmatic way that she is the bad guy, her role has been chosen as a more of pole guide that tries to give a hint what is this story about. In other words: you have a picture, but without frame, and we know that without some of the basic components, you can't have a full masterpiece. As final words, Hancock had a great potential to develop as a blockbuster, but its poor execution forced him back, and it ended as a production you will not enjoy seeing again.",8,1,4,7 July 2008
