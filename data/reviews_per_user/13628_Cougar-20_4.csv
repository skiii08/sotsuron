Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," excellence leads to success
","I`ve seen TPM  2 weeks ago and it really was great ! It got everything which is known for all SW movies before ! Great special effects and amazing sound effects too. John Williams has done a great job again and Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and also Natalie Portman looked great ! Although I knew what  to expect I still was kinda surprised when the movie was over ! This movie really is the millenniums best SF movie and belongs on top of all other movies as well. Yes, I'am a big SW fan, that`s true but let me say that, if u won`t see the movie u you`ve really missed something ! Trust me !",10,0,0,25 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Finally they return !
","Only six years after the first SW movie George Lucas shows us of what he`s able to do ! Take a close look to those special effects and tell me how often do you see that in SF movies nowadays !? John Williams again made a great job and proves himself as one of the best ever in that business. This movie should be the one all have waited for cause it is the end of the whole story. Every question will be answered, well not every, that`s why we`ll see episode one to three in the next years but it is the happy end and also the final chapter in a story that has everything in it !",10,2,5,25 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Best ever ?
","Well, as a matter of fact look at the year SW A New Hope was produced ! Was there any other SF movie that has greatness written all over ? I don`t think so and even nowadays some SF movies really look bad if u compare them to this old SF movie ! Lucas has done a great job, so did the actors (Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher) ! John Williams also became a more than just mentionable name in that list of great performer who made this movie one of the greatest ever !",10,0,0,25 June 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Better than ever before !
","After a great first Indy Jones came a second disappointing one but to finish that series Lucas brought two of the best actors ever together ! But that`s not enough at all ! The Story is also a good one. Well maybe a bit comparable to the first Jones movie but it has everything and even more than the first one. This movie gives you also some answers. Why does Indy have this whip and why does he hate snakes ? Yep, it`s all in here so don`t miss it it`s worth seeing it. Especially when you`ve watched the first two of them !",8,0,0,25 June 1999
