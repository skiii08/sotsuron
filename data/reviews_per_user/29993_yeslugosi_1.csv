Walk the Line," Where Have You Been?
","What a great film. The mix of a great story line, gifted actors and great directing is exactly what Hollywood needs to fill those empty theaters. Ladies and Gentleman, we have a new star and his name is Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Johnny Cash was not acting. This performance was far above acting. The proof is found midway through the film where Johnny Cash sits at the dinner table staring at his father. Without saying a word you can feel exactly what he wants to say just by his look. That is how you do it. Reese Witherspoon gave a wonderful performance and seemed to be on the same level as Joaquin. The next five years are going to be very interesting to see where these two young stars go in their careers. I'm putting my money on Joaquin. Great job guys.",10,2,4,5 December 2005
