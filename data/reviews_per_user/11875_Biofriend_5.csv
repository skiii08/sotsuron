The King's Speech," Rise above the fear of yourself
",Sometimes you feel movies have magic you feel so deeply engrossed... that you see as if the things are happening in real. 'The King's Speech' is indeed a magical experience. People were whispering that Academy awards are biased but I will certainly say that the movie was no less than bliss each and every phase each and every phrase were so eloquently poised that this movie gets an aura I was appreciative of James Franco's presentation of ordeal and rooted for his Oscar and was postponing watching the 'The King's Speech' for so long I was annoyed of Colin Firth's recognition as the winner of the Best Actor in Academy awards  but not anymore Colin Firth played the role of the lifetime he was so real with his stammer his anxiousness to be the King and not able to deliver was so believable that now I feel I should bow to his acting capabilities though if you have watched 'The single man' you must be his fan alreadyGeoffrey Rush was no less but all above I should salute Tom Hooper for creating the classic as what Tom Hanks was explaining about The movie is not about some speech adjustments it is movie about the struggle of a king to deliver to his own people be rightful to one's duties shoulder the responsibilities be it whatever and you can relate it with everything in your life This movie is about rising above what people feel about you you be black you be small you be fat... but you need to love and admire yourself first you should not feel frightened of your own shadow you have to rise above good and badyou need to see yourself from a true friend's eyes and you will see that you are indeed beautiful you are what you are  and you are no less than people around you if they don't appreciate you you just need to turn the page and find someone who is true to you be it love be it a friend I gave it 9 of 10....more royal cinematography would have helped it to score a perfect 10,9,0,0,3 March 2011
127 Hours," truly orgasmic
",Danny Boyle was at his best while writing the adapted screenplay.. the flashes in the movie were so real that you can relate yourself with it...Getting a movie out of a monotonous painful experience needs quality.. some scenes were so beautifully written that you won't be able to hold your tears...James Franco...he made me cry with him and made me feel all the pain that he was feeling ..there was a scene where he was cussing himself for not letting anyone know where he goes for adrenaline rush and realizing the same moment that no one will be able to find and rescue him sent shivers through my spine... the scene where he cut his main artery ...the scene and his pain..even just thinking about it sends chill through out my body...None can snatch the Academy awards from him...and even he doesn't get one.. in my eyes he is the Oscar winner...and now I know why several felt the panic attack when it was screened in film festival last year..even I called mom after watching the movie...But all above.. is its background score...I feel so proud admiring the creation of the musical maestro ...A.R. Rehman...the song 'If I rise' that he sand with Dido is just awesome... the symphony with it is just mesmerizing...and I am damn sure this year too Rehman will grab the Academy awards....the song reminded me of the melancholy melodies that Solitary reaper must have been singing... the song is like a poem.. a Wordsworth poem with Shakespearean poise.. and every time AR Rehman sings If I rise.. I get goosebumps... :D... I am so proud of you Rehman....You are truly a Bharat Ratna in my eyes...,9,0,2,28 January 2011
Hancock," The other side of super hero
","I was amazed by the reviews in meta critic and low score. Not that I don't rely on these score to choose what movie to watch and what to skip but Hancock is a real exception.The movie rather than showing the all powerful side of the superheroes and the wonder of being immortal; the movie the showcased how lonely can a superhero be, if he is living an immortal life. The romance between the immortal pair who becomes mortal and victim of attacks was so beautifully shown that I watched the movie more than a dozen time.Will smith is so much believable as the lonely superhero. Neither the super powers of Hancock nor the action scenes makes these movie a wonder for me but it is the vulnerability and the undying love.I will simply recommend you to watch the movie without the superhero angle, it is only an added plus.Believe me giving a 9 to this movie is totally justified.",9,3,5,18 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," There's a storm coming....
","When Christopher Nolan said that he is going to end Dark Knight series .. I was wondering how he gonna surpass the 'The Dark Knight fame' to give a finale that we all need to remember the trilogy forever..and he gave 'The Dark Knight Rises'..I am not a hardcore movie buff...so I am not the one who rush to buy the first day first show ticket.. I am kind of person who wait to get the rush over or sometimes watch the movie on DVD..but with this movie..all I could do was wait for a day because the first day shows were all booked in advance...The movie started.. I was thinking of writing a detailed blog on different aspects of the movie.. like its editing, music, SFX, Video effects, direction.. and I am sure you know what happened.. I was so engrossed in the movie that first brake from my train of admiration I got was the 3 minute break during intermission..and then I was busy again ..the whole movie was so exciting and so well finished that I couldn't pick any one department above the others... It was an awesome movie with every aspect awesomely executed...The movie was slow in the beginning but you will never feel bored but the later half none had time to think about anything but the movie...However, being a hardcore Christopher Nolan fan.. I was a little disappointed with the cast of the movie.. Having watched Inception so many times just to have a grasp on the movie.. I remember each one of the Inception character by heart.. and seeing them popping up in Dark Knight rises was a big let down for me... this was the only time when I actually believed that movie is not happening in real but a fantasy because I have seen the characters before...I so wanted Christopher Nolan to try out new casts so that I can believe that the 'Gotham City' exists in real...because the visual department did an excellent work to make the city more real than anything....I am sure 250 millions bucks were well spent...In the end!! If it is the initial weeks of the movie and you are reading movie reviews before buying the ticket or waiting for the DVD release.. then I will just say one thing...'There's a storm coming....' Watch it before it is too late to feel the thrill....",10,6,13,23 July 2012
Slumdog Millionaire," An overrated movie....
","Though the movie was commendable in portraying the real India, but the script was all too dreamy to cast any effect on the viewers. It was clearly evident that it is made by foreign guys who only knew one thing about India that it is poor and poor people abuse. Direction was good and so was the camera work. The kids who portrayed the younger version were so brilliant that you won't believe that they are kids. Though the main character was well chosen but I guess the casting people were too busy on the lead that they forgot to take interest on other characters.The script had too many loopholes but I guess the slum-boy turning to millionaire sympathy saved the movie. Overall it is a nice entertainment with some excellent music score by A.R. Rehman, but don't go expecting too much while watching the movie. Overall I will give only 6/10 to this movie with credits to the lead actor, direction, music and excellent camera work and the producers should blame the script writers and poor casting for loosing the magic figure of 10/10",6,102,199,11 January 2009
