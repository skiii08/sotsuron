Hereditary," So refreshing !!
","First of all, I hate associating jumpscares to horror. To me, jumpscares are just horrible in the moment they happen and the true horror is the one that follows you even after you leave the theater. And OH MY I wasn't disappointed with this movie; It's not just like many other 'horror' movies where it's a low budget story that is built in the only goal to put jumpscares. It's a horror movie but also a family drama so hard to watch sometimes but so fascinating at the same time. The performance is just phenomenal (some actors deserve an oscar for real). I actually don't know what to say except that when I left the theater, I felt like I never felt before. So if you hesitate to go watch the movie, don't expect to see some jumpscares happening in a middle of a wanna be story, it's way more but mostly, if you can, don't watch anything about the movie before go watch it, the less you know about the movie, the more you're going to appreciate it.",8,5,9,17 June 2018
