Skyfall," Skyfall: Sadly the best Bond movie ever...Only question is...How??
","One of the best Bond movies ever (at least what the film experts call it) 'Skyfall' gathered a whopping 1 billion at the box office thus being the only highest earning James Bond movie. Having a budget of 150-200 million, Skyfall takes you to some of the appealing locations in the world. Thanks to Sam Mendes's extra-ordinary imagination, the film takes us on a mini tour. May it be the ostentatious city of Shanghai to one of the magnificent gambling dens in Macau; Mendes has done an impressive job in the director's chair. As a movie buff, I would give my thumbs up to the director without a slight reluctance. Only problem lies with me is the weak plot of the movie clearing giving clich√©s at some points. I am quite sure that this utter statement which I made might drop some jaws enough to tag me as a hysterical person altogether. But I personally found Daniel Craig starrer 'Casino Royale', a far improved & an impeccable endeavour than Skyfall. The movie starts with two agents James Bond & Eve Moneypenny chasing a man named Patrice down the streets of Istanbul who has a very important hard drive; something which acquired can save a cataclysmic event. A terrific bike chase sequence is shown where Bond & Patrice end up falling on the top of the train. 'Ok! Now I am excited. Let's see what Mendes has to show now ' was how my thoughts were directed watching Bond & Patrice engage in a pernicious fistfight. But somehow I was disappointed when Eve who got herself positioned alongside with a sniper rifle under the pretext of shooting Patrice, shot Bond instead. It was her mistake. Mistakes do happen. But a man who falls from a height in the waterfall with a bullet in his shoulder is sure to die. But he doesn't. The question of 'Who saves him?' is still unresolved till date. C'mon Mendes, show some realism while making such sequences. Only Indian audiences can put their faith here only because they have been subjected to many such mindless sequences in past.A presumed-dead James Bond soon returns back to London when his organization MI6 is targeted to massive gas explosions as someone underground hacks into their highly secure systems. Put out on the field by his boss M (Judi Dench) even though he is degraded & merely held on his feet by alcohol, Bond makes himself ready to chase down this hacker who has started a grudge mission against British Secret service. The film is magnificent, Bond happens to look cooler than before but the plot is flawed at places but somehow those flaws aren't important enough to be noticed by viewers. But some scenes did deserve some more thinking, brilliance & realism. I recollect a scene where Silva, the hacker is caught up & held in MI6 headquarters but he soon escapes the cell with no bigger fuss than you could imagine. Mendes did his best to imitate the Joker sequence from The Dark Knight but ended up doing rather childishly. I mean as soon as the bespectacled geeky-looking genius 'Q' connects Silva's laptop to the main server, the port generates an algorithm hacking the entire system thus setting the cell door open. Now you don't really require a cinematic vision to think about such a plot. Even a not-so-expert naive software engineer can think about such an idea. The movie deserved better considering the hype it left behind after its release. Then they mention that Silva's planning the escape since years. Oh really! I mean he really knew the new changed location of MI6 after gas bombing since years. Admirable foresight he has I must say. The action sequence towards the end of the movie looks promising except few unanswered questions which still linger in my mind. I heard bullet in legs can take days for an unattended victim to die. So how does M succumb to her injury just after hours of being shot on her leg? A helicopter falls on the mansion & there is a massive explosion & anything within a radius of few meters of the bungalow is sure to be caught in fire. But Silva who is just standing in front of the house escapes without even a small burn or a bruise. How? Jump in the water beneath the ice & I am confident you won't even be able to stand properly when you get out. But here comes James Bond as if he is just back from his regular swimming sessions. Overall, I have no qualms with Skyfall except the fact that a small love story or a romantic angle at some point could have been poignant on the celluloid. The film is opulent & deserved more judging Craig's superb acting. Nevertheless I personally feel the tag of the highest Bond earning movie would have looked better on 'Casino Royale' rather than 'Skyfall'. But for action lovers, Skyfall is not worth giving a miss. It remains brilliant if the sluggish flaws are proudly overlooked. I tried doing it but I failed to know why. Maybe others can. Good Luck!",6,2,4,9 November 2013
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Creates a Long-Lasting Impression !!!! Amazing....
","Today's Hindi film industry observes that the movies related on lives of famous personalities, which are termed as biopic are attaining fast recognition and acclaim. Dhulia's Paan Singh Tomar, Luthria's Dirty Picture, Legend of Bhagat Singh and Chak De India are illustrations of such highly acclaimed projects. Considering this ongoing trend, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (Director of Rang De Basanti and Delhi 6) decided to encompass the real-life episodes of the athlete Milkha Singh in this film 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'. The film happens to be a sweeping and stirring biography of Milkha Singh entitled as 'The Flying Sikh' about his uphill struggle, apprehensions and his path towards glory. Three hours and 8 minutes of this Farhan Akhtar starrer keeps u hooked to your seat from commencement to conclusion.The starting scene of the film is based in 1960 in Rome, Italy showing Olympic sports meet where a sprinter Milkha Singh starts the race being ahead of all but slowly loses speed and agility as the past memories of his childhood begin to haunt him amidst the race dropping him to the fourth position. The main reason for this loss happens to be a shout given by his coach saying 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' which triggers these past memories. This is the point where we know that this athlete has gone through some tough depressing days in his childhood. However, generation of past memories only by mere ushering by his coach for a highly experienced athlete seems very unrealistic.After the unfortunate loss in Rome, Jawaharlal Nehru announces sports meet between India and Pakistan to be held on the Pakistani land and Milkha refuses to be the part of this meet. The movie goes back a few decades where a child Milkha is seen having his happy time in a village of Punjab until one day, due to India-Pakistan partition, war commences there leading to all his friends and relatives getting massacred with only few survivors. Milkha comes to Delhi, India in search of his elder sister thereby leading a life of misery and unstoppable agony being a local goon stealing coals from passing-by trains with his local friends falls in love madly with a Punjabi girl (Sonam Kapoor) and decides to transform himself into a gentleman to win her hand for marriage. He joins Indian Army and ends up being an athlete due to his running capabilities and agility. A sprinter running for the Indian army, starts representing his own country India in Olympics, thus fulfilling his own ambition of doing so. The film shows some of his glorious and triumphant moments as a successful sprinter. Some of the episodes in film show his intimate moments with an Australian girl Stella as the film slowly starts unnecessarily deviating from its genre. The film happens to be respectful but unreasonably long. Farhan gets the golden opportunity to portray one of the most iconic characters hence delivering his most phenomenal performance till today. Right from a sculpted physique, body language to his look, Farhan has extended his capability beyond his limits. Dilip Tahil also delivers a convincing performance as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru while Divya Dutta captures the viewers emotionally.The music director trio Shankar-Ehsan-Loy captures every beat with mastery uplifting the background score of the film, making the soul of the film more beautiful. Along with some splendid music, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra takes care with his shots, zooming in and using slow-motion to make a body travelling through a finish line. The film would have been totally flawless should the director have pruned some unnecessary scenes only to have made the film short and sweet. The story oscillates abruptly from Milkha's personal and professional life and also displaying the flashback memories again and again. The race scenes are too much in slow motion but there is sufficient dramatic control by the director and grace in Farhan's acting.",7,0,2,17 July 2013
Taxi Driver," The Most Organ-azized Drama Ever
","Taxi Driver is an American drama directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader inspired from 1956 John Ford film 'The Searchers'. The screenplay is crafted so artistically by Paul showcasing a raw, nerve- wrecking and powerful look at depression and solitude. The film has the capability to become an altogether successful venture when the actor-director synergy can make astonishing wonders happen. De Niro and Scorsese happen to be one such example. The collaboration between these two has given us some of the really extravagant films. The movie starts with a Taxi moving in a slow motion as it leaves a foggy smoke behind as credit starts appearing in the cloud of smoke giving a more artistic feel to the beginning of the movie. Travis Bickle an ex-Marine officer suffering from chronic insomnia returns to Manhattan, New York after the Vietnam War. A person having no real life experience in flesh-and-blood human relationships gets alienated in the city of aflame and enthusiastic people. Travis takes up a job as a taxi driver on a night duty travelling around the city watching the night- life and prowlers that rule the streets of NY after nightfall. He is a person who tries to mimic the interactions he sees on the streets and goes horribly wrong, watches dirty movie in a porno theater, falls for a girl working in the Senator Palantine's campaign, takes her for a porn movie making her feel awkward and terribly angry. His small acts highlight his lack of human touch and his unstable mind. The director had pivoted the confused notions of the protagonist successfully as the audience was meant to assume him to be a psycho. Travis in the latter half of the movie, fails in repeated attempts to get his love back and finally makes up his mind to assassinate the Senator only to flaunt his prejudice. After a failed Palantine assassination, Travis freeds himself from frustration as he guns down three men who he holds responsible for corrupting a girl's youth in a brothel to rescue a 12 year old prostitute named Iris in an unsurpassed bloodbath. Scorsese proved himself a creative genius through Taxi driver. Only part remains undisclosed in movie is the reason Iris chose to run away from home only to become a prostitute at an age where she ought to be going to school, giving an uneasy feeling to the viewers. Like all the Scorsese directed films, redemption is the soul of the film. The audience, terrified and overwhelmed by urban crime will readily respond to any film about heroic vigilantism in future. Courtesy: Martin Scorsese. The review title pertaining to a stupidly cracked joke by Travis in the film, the drama is one of the most organized and a soulful drama made in the history of Hollywood.",8,1,1,30 June 2013
Interstellar," Interstellar : More than a director, it is made by a DREAMER
","Christopher Nolan's comprehensive Weltanschauung ( conception of universe and human's analogy to it ) Interstellar is his most endearing, audacious and expertly scripted venture. A script which once was developed by Jonathan Nolan for Steven Spielberg finally ended in the helms of his brother Chris. A sheer ocular pleasure, when viewed on 75 mm screen, this movie based intergalactic space voyage smells of ambition, emotion and beauty. The viewer doesn't needs to suspend his incredulity inspite of the film being a piece of fiction, owing to the fact that it is one of Nolan's strongest narrative.An enthralling and distinct start to movie reminding us of social documentaries which pictures blight-induced earth as a dust bowl with last shades of humanity left, earth has become inhabitable over time with increasing crop failure and frequent dust storms. Amidst the scenario comes Cooper (McConaughey), a widowed engineer-turned- pilot-turned-farmer who is prompted by some ghostly forces ( who send coded messages) to visit NASA facility in the outskirts of his village. The facility led by Dr John Brand (Micheal Caine) reveals Cooper about a secret mission in search of a habitable planet beyond the solar system and he asks Cooper to pilot the space ark 'Endurance' with the team. Devastated at the thought of her father leaving her, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is filled with discontent and hatred for him.The film tracks Cooper's odyssey along with the NASA team and two robots CASE and TARS as they travel through the wormholes to discover a sustainable living environment while Dr Brand and grown- up Murph (Jessica Chastain) try and solve the inevitable problem of gravity. The direction is accurate and film balances well between different time zones as Cooper and his accomplices verge many light years ahead.Unavoidable comparisons with Gravity and 2001: a Space Odyssey, Interstellar thinks more about the future than focusing all its attention on the present and past. A graphically rich special effects packaged with a mammoth script which reflects a large time devoted to research and a great casting, Interstellar might be specious and flawed at places but it doesn't stop the movie from being a winner.8 on 10 stars",8,4,8,12 January 2015
Full Metal Jacket," One of the finest war films I have ever seen...Shapeless but pragmatic enough.
","I never saw a Stanley Kubrick film even though boasting about my utter penchant for films goes in sheer vain. But I heard about them a heck lot. The horror genre in Hollywood can surely be exemplified by Kubrick's 'The Shining'. He even had furnished his mastery when he gave the dream of eye-popping sci-fi effects a refined shape in his '2001: A Space Odyssey '. But I started by watching the first Kubrick film by giving his war film 'Full Metal Jacket' a worthwhile try. Why Full Metal jacket? Maybe it is because war films have a strong flavour of despair, horror and plethoric human drama and I love it all.Full Metal Jacket consists of two distinct parts. A soft tone of 'Kiss me goodbye and write me when I am gone' marks the beginning the movie where the group of grunts are sitting in saloon getting their heads shaved off. That is the drill; the one to get them trained on Paris Island so that they can find themselves capable to be recruited in Marine Corps. The Island is a place where a straight poker face and nods to the senior drill instructor's commands becomes their only fate of life.However, the drill instructor sergeant Hartman is not the one worth belying with. He is arrogant, aggressive, regards the privates as lowest form of life on the earth & shows rapid impulses to petty mistakes by the privates. His favourite barb-target is Private Gomer Pyle (so renamed from Leonard Lawrence by the instructor himself), an obese klutz who is often taunted and contradicted for his obese body and his utter inability to participate in workouts & is meant to be quite obtuse.The rigorous physical training sessions, continuous streak of taunts by the instructor & predestined antipathy which his associate privates have for him puts Pyle's innocence & endurance to a test; The test which concludes with a Pyle transforming into an antagonist shooting up the sergeant and himself.The latter half in majority is based in Vietnam and showcases war scenes and bloodbath. Private Joker (Mathew Modine), the one who used to bunk with Pyle and the sheer witness of his antagonism is recruited as a war correspondent in Stars and Stripes which publishes military newspaper in Vietnam. Following incoming enemy attacks all over South Vietnam, Joker is briefed and sent to Phu Bai along with his cameraman Rafterman to interview the platoon and record their experiences regarding the war. He meets his Paris Island associate Private Cowboy in Lusthog Squad as the entire party gradually gets drawn into a booby trap.Even though the film is pragmatic, it is completely shapeless and fails to deal within realms of realism. The second half invites a fruitful comparison to other war films like 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. As it progresses, culminates into a horrendous picture of war and horror.It is comfortably understandable and has no easy catharsis. Kubrick has enhanced the visuals quite fantastically by his daunting angles at the scene of carnage. He manages to create a marvellous visual epiphany on the trembling prisoner at the end. As compared to 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon', Full Metal Jacket appears naive but can hold a tight grip on the viewer's attention for the complete duration. Cheers for Stanley Kubrick8 on 10 stars",8,0,1,29 January 2014
American Hustle," Ingenious, refined and crisply scripted
","A movie's fate is driven somehow by a powerful factor of the star cast; a kind of actors that people would love to see interacting on screen. David O Russell uses this over utilized cinematic weapon of an ensemble cast for his con-film 'American Hustle'. Along with Eric Warren Singer, The Silver Linings playbook director also managed to have a lion's share in formulating the screenplay. Impeccably refined, masterful performances and reflection of sheer ingenuity is what American Hustle offers to the audience. The film gets us through some clich√©s and prodigal deviations but overall it bestows a worthwhile experience for the cinema lovers.The pot-bellied Irvin Rosenfeld sets up a fake company to grant loans to the needy people thereby having an expertise in money laundering. His success reaches a capstone when Sydney Prosser walks into his life. Posing as the British lace curtain 'Edith Greensley', Sydney assists Irvin and both gradually become the 1978 con experts who succeed in controlling various scams but finally end up getting caught blatantly by The FBI. FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Bradley Cooper) arrests the duo on the charges of earning money by fraudulent schemes. He offers them immunity but in exchange wants them to aid The FBI to conduct a massive bust which will put the Mayor Carmine Polito and other politicians including the congressman behind bars.Di Maso falsifies the identity of an Arab Sheikh who apparently is his Mexican friend. He, guided by Irving and Sydney together indulges in convincing the Mayor Polito about Sheikh's active interest in conducting business with him. Carmine Polito is the one to be struggling to assemble funds to resuscitate the Atlantic City. The trio uses Mayor's very keen desire to invest into Atlantic City as the driving force to bring him and other corrupt politicians to ground. Jenifer Lawrence plays Irvin's wife Rosalyn who is rather a piquant personality rather succumbing to being impulsive & manipulative throughout. Robert De Niro who plays a Mafia kingpin Victor Tellgio makes an impressive cameo. The most striking factor of the film is that deeper the film takes you inside the plan; more layers of this operation begin to unravel making it completely embellishing.American Hustle has a crisp screenplay as the characters spring to live and engages you throughout the duration. David o Russell's direction poses as a strong reminder to Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' following its narrative which enhances the experience throughout thereby giving Russell's ambitious nature a strong highlight. The script is sleight but lucid. The movie however successfully manages to break the monotony of action sequences and burlesque comedies in cinema and provides a rich perpetual experience.However, I sincerely feel 'American Hustle' strongly exemplifies how a con-film should be presented on the celluloid.",7,2,3,20 January 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Labyrinthine plot with a protracted conclusion !!! Kudos...
","The girl with a Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 mystery thriller film having incredibly dark and violent subject matter based on Steig Larsson's Swedish novel which goes by the same name. The movie stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in pivotal roles. The director David Fincher had to use his often-used tool of perfection to avoid the film being a disappointment since the novel hyped and he has succeeded in every form. The movie has a labyrinthine plot with the scenes shot at beautiful landscapes with Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography portraying the dark interiors. It all commences with Swedish reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) losing a calumny case put up against him by a businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m. He is soon assigned by Henrik Vagner to unravel an unsolved mystery of his grandniece Harriet who vanished 40 years ago and wasn't found since. In return he is promised a piece of information which can prove useful in defaming Wennerstr√∂m. Meanwhile Lisabeth Salander (Mara), a bisexual, computer hacker and a researcher who bears psychological wounds of harsh upbringing is assigned to a new guardian Nils Bjurman, a lawyer by profession. This socio-path hacker suffers physical and sexual abuses from hands of Nilis who starts taking advantage of his position. It is depressing to watch the scene where Lisabeth is raped miserably by Nilis and is forced to take brutal revenge as a counter-attack. Here lies the speciality of Salander whose acts of vengeance showcase her absolute ability to expel evil with the help of evil. Fincher makes sure that the plot generates a wait to see Mikael and Lisabeth's life collide as initially their lives start running parallel to each other. Mikael who is on the verge of investigating the lost Harriet case puts up a demand for an investigator to assist him to solve the mystery. Sexual and physical abuse from hands of man who she thinks she can trust leads Lisabeth to join hands with Mikael. Fincher captures the essence of the novel in a truthful manner. For those who haven't read the novel, this film is a roller coaster ride showing murder, corruption, family secrets and inner demons of the two associates working on a 40-year old mystery. The typical procedural focus on topography is deflected into archival topography - the island's magnificent and reticulated landscape is pulverized into monochromatic, snowy ambiance. Craig diverges from his James Bond persona and does a completely new character thus displaying his excellent acting skills. Mara does a totally fantastic job as the girl with a dragon tattoo. A 8/10 for this another Fincher-made masterpiece.",8,2,8,4 July 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Replete with thrills and chills, Mission Impossible 5 makes you crave for more....
","The latest instalment of Mission impossible franchise celebrates Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt) as an action hero more than the story which itself provides a structure to Ethan Hunt's ways of working with fictional organization IMF( Impossible Mission Force). Directed by the screenwriter of 'The Usual Suspects', it is hard to believe that Christopher McQuarrie ever had some brilliant ideas. Honestly as a viewer I was dissatisfied with the screenplay. However the edge-of- the-seat action sequences acted as a savior in disguise.The story involves a wicked replica of the IMF called 'The Syndicate', a criminal organization trained to bring down the IMF, as they stealthily go on killing leaders in bombings and assassinations to bring about the 'change' in the world. A Senate committee meanwhile dissolves the IMF, availing the efforts of William Brandt and granting the leftover assets to the CIA with Ethan Hunt on their prime target list. Now Hunt is left with only one job that is to prove that The Syndicate falls within the bounds of realism and is not merely the creation of his own. The Syndicate controlled by bespectacled and spooky Solomon Lane who is pursued by Ethan with his old sidekick tech-expert Benji and gorgeous Ilsa Faust to bring The Syndicate to ground.Mission Impossible: The Rogue Nation provides the viewers with a glitzy appeal taking on a tour to Vienna, Casablanca and London and some promisingly heart-wrenching stunts and fights. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt faces more serious and complicated obstacles to reach his coveted aim. He keeps you startled as he holds to a flying plane and his dear life waiting for Benji to open its door. He jumps in thousands of gallons of pressurized water to change to break into the data facility; he pursues on bike in high speed chase sequences and really keeps you engaged till the very end.MI 5 was pure adrenaline as McQuarrie succeeded brilliantly in keeping the weak script concealed behind the nail-biting thrills that gratify the action-movie lovers to the extent that they certainly crave for the sixth installment. I personally think it should have connected well to the past ventures apart from the characters. However the film takes care of everything that MI series has boasted of in the past including flashy tech gadgets and stunts. And lastly, the credit to MI5 being an unarguably successful installment goes to Tom Cruise who has defied age and fueled the execution of the screenplay brilliantly. 6 on 10 stars",6,0,2,12 August 2015
Django Unchained," Most accessible Tarantino film till date
","Being a movie buff, I was well acquainted with Quentin Tarantino for his master-work in two exquisite projects Pulp Fiction (1994) Inglorious Basterds (2009). That is why I was more eager than usual for watching his 2012 movie, Django Unchained starring Christoph Waltz, Jamie Fox & Leonardo DiCaprio in lead roles. The title comes from Django, 1966 western drama starring Franco Nero who happens to make a remarkable cameo in Django Unchained. The horror that Django Unchained expresses isn't of slavery, but of a filmmaker attempting historical but a entertaining endeavor while shackled by his own superior persona.Tarantino found an appropriate channel to exhibit aggression & violence in a dramatic manner. The plot is set up in the year 1958 post Civil War where black negroes were traded, enslaved and tortured in return of money. The opening sequence depicts two brothers Ace Speck & Dicky Speck with several chained Negro slaves being taken to a place somewhere in Texas. Among those slaves is Django, the slave who is determined to save his wife Broomhilda who is being separated from him during an auction. The Speck brothers during their travel are interrupted by a dentist turned bounty hunter Dr King Schultz (Waltz) who offers to buy Django from the Speck brothers but ends up shooting one & injuring other severely since they refuse to initiate the sale & Django gets unchained.Schultz offers Django complete freedom if he identifies the Brittle brothers whom Schultz, being a bounty hunter is required to kill. It somehow happens that Django has the ability to recognize the Brittle brothers as he had worked in their plantations before being auctioned to wilderness. The two go on bounty hunting rampage when finally Schultz gets so enamored to Django that he offers to aid him in his search to rescue Broomhilda. There is more to Django than just a bounty hunter's right hand. Django has forbidden love for his wife which he restricts from reflecting on his face as he has Broomhilda on his mind even after being separated from her. Cinematically Tarantino has represented it rather beautifully. The underlying soul of the film is that the freedman Django & the hit-man Schultz are pitted against Calvin Candie, the owner of Candyland plantation & his butcher Stephen to save Broomhilda who is working as a slave in Candyland. The violence is outsize and enormous but not disturbing and Tarantino has successfully created a niche to showcase on screen violence with several blood splashing & spilling scenes. The action sequences are blood, gore & comedy-rolled together thus keeping us entertained all the way. Christoph waltz ought to get thumbs up for playing a scrupulous, lethal & politely taunting bounty hunter. Even the role of antagonist Calvin Candie is played beautifully by DiCaprio as he succeeds to look both well-mannered as well as purely evil displaying sheer splendor & ability. 'Django Unchained' is 165 minutes long and is filled with moments of agonizing & teased out action and surprises in casting as well as the story. Some people may have criticized the director on how racist the film happens to be but if you still throughout the film; you can discover plenty of scenes for the audience to engage in. The world created by Tarantino in film is not just of misery and pain but one having sarcasm, racism, extreme violence and reprehensible people.",8,0,3,2 August 2013
Schindler's List," Spielberg : The Creative Genius....Hats off !
","Schindler's List (1993), directed by the most acclaimed director Steven Spielberg is the most touching and fascinating movie Hollywood ever witnessed. The movie has Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes playing the key roles in the film. Spielberg demonstrates his creative genius by taking the audience back into the era regarded as the worst period in the history of mankind, the Holocaust. The protagonist Oskar Schindler, played quite beautifully by Liam Neeson is a true Nazi gentleman having a taste for women, liquor and money. A sense of confidence is reflected in the eyes of Oskar as he goes on to establish an enterprise having Jews as the manual labourers. It was the time when Jew labour was considered to be the cheapest and it seemed perfect for Oskar to make a successful business. He appoints a Jew manager by the name Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) who once ran a factory in the Cracow ghetto. Stern does the job of recruiting Jew labour while Schindler takes care of the flamboyance (that is what he claims he is good at). The work of running a labour camp in Pasz√≥w is entrusted to Amon Goeth, a ruthless Nazi general. The Krakow ghetto is liquidated and numerous Jews are sent to allocate in the labour camps where innocent Jews are shot in cold blood by Amon for no reason and just to fulfill his immoral satisfaction. As the film progresses, a gradual change in Oskar Schindler takes place. The person who used to think only about his enterprise and the profits associated with it starts feeling a concern and a sense of sadness for the devastated Jews. The audience can literally sense the humanitarian nature evolved in Oskar Schindler. The name 'Schindler's List' pertaining to the list which Oskar prepares to bring in thousands of Jews into his company thereby freeing them from the clutches of Amon. Spielberg creates an artistic feel as the movie is shot in black and white and the viewer gets himself time-travelled in the past. The movie ends with Schindler saving more than thousand Jews thus stopping paving a way for another world. The film has a very pertinent dialogue quoted by Stern. He says 'Whoever saves one life saves the world entire'. A Big salute to Spielberg and this masterpiece... Nudity: Yes Kissing: Mild Foul Language: No Blood and Gore:Yes",10,28,48,15 June 2013
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A Magical Experience!!!
","Being a fan and an admirer of David Fincher's movies like Fight Club, Social Network, Zodiac and The Girl with a dragon Tattoo, I decided to catch with the Brad Pitt starer 'the Curious Case of Benjamin Button' based on a 1921 short story. A totally new concept is what I witnessed after watching this movie thereby considering this endeavor to be Pitt's best till date. In the year 2005, Caroline goes to see her mother Daisy lying on her deathbed in a hospital in New Orleans. Aware that she is not going to live long, Daisy makes Caroline read a diary which contains the story of Benjamin Button. After end of World War 2, In November 1918, a mother died giving birth to a boy. Since the infant is old, wrinkled and ugly, he gets abandoned by his father Thomas Button by leaving him on the stairs of an old age home. The mistress of the old age home Queenie takes care of the little baby clearly getting over the fact that he is ugly in appearance, considering him to be the child of God. The doctor claims that the baby boy won't live long since his body condition is weak and deteriorating. But Fate has something else in the store for Benjamin (as he is so named by Queenie). Throughout the film, Benjamin follows a reverse aging pattern. Rather than becoming old, he starts becoming younger than before. The prime soul of the film is Benjamin's friend Daisy who goes on to become the pivotal part of the movie. Right from 1918 to present day 2005, the plot goes forward recreating every era it witnesses. The movie is mainly about Benjamin's life and his struggle in coping up with the world that looks at him again and again in a way which makes him realize that he is different. The film is about the unconditional love which Benjamin and Daisy share and how they seemingly realize they can't be together for long due to Benjamin's curious case. The film contains scenes which triggers emotion in the viewers. Pitt escapes off with a fine performance. Cate Blanchett who plays the young Daisy also gets on very well. Overall, a big bow to Fincher for gifting us this magical experience.",7,1,2,28 June 2013
The Dark Knight," A Redefined Approach to a Superhero Film
","The Dark Knight, directed by Christopher Nolan is the second installment of Nolan's Batman trilogy. The sequel to 2005 stunner ' The Batman Begins' has an ensemble cast of Christian bale, Morgan Freeman, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman in key roles. The film is dark, twisted and austere having a dazzling spectacle and feverish action promising a fun-filled experience ahead.The film ran a successful theatrical period as the audiences started flooding in to watch a fabled gift from Heath Ledger who plays the evil Joker 6 months after his death and he didn't disappoint them. Like all other superhero movies, the underlying theme of the movie is the battle between the good and the bad. The film begins with iconic bank robbery scene shot with an IMAX camera as six robbers try to rob a mob bank but only one winner to claim all the stolen money leaving others dead. Of course it is the Joker, the person who wears a purple colored suit (his usual dress code), having his face painted chalk-white and a big red smile which extends further from his mouth. Needless to say, Joker opens up with an electrifying performance as expected by the viewers.He speaks in calibrated accent enunciating his words properly enough to produce terror. His smart-liners steal the majority of the limelight. In one scene, when he says to Batman 'You complete me'. Don't buy the tease. He means it. Joker starts in the film with simplicity in his action but this simplicity itself goes on to terrify the audience as the movie progresses. We can clearly glimpse chaos at the heart of the Joker instead of creation as he threatens Batman through media that he will start to kill people of Gotham and only way to stop this is by disclosing his true identity. Joker's fiendishly designed actions are meant to pose dilemmas for his enemies. His evil and mean side is highlighted in certain scenes. For example, when he states he doesn't use a gun since the knife savors all the emotions of the victim. Bruce Wayne aka Batman played by Bale is the masked crusader of Gotham who finds himself at war with his own conscience. He is in love with his childhood friend Rachael (Gyllenhaal) who finds herself torn between the love of two heroes of Gotham, the masked vigilante Batman and the district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Batman is indeed the ray of hope to end organized crime in Gotham as he tries his best to apprehend Joker, confronts the head of crime family Maroni and brings down the Chinese accountant Lau who handles the Mob's money. Eckhart handles the role of Harvey Dent with magnificence as he earns the title of Gotham's white knight (the one who doesn't need a mask to stop crime on the streets of Gotham). Later, Harvey dent's character transformed from a candid cop in to a bitter monster which the joker wanted. His sole aim was to bring down Gotham's white knight to the echelon of brutality and he succeeds with a cunning plan to be executed at his behest.Then, there is Wayne's butler Alfred (Caine) who also happens to be a fatherly figure sends often a supply of useful advices to Bruce whenever needed. The Alfred-Bruce relationship is the strong pillar on which the whole Batman legend stands firmly. Alfred also destroys the secret that is likely to demoralize his boss thus proving him to be more than just a butler for Wayne. Other accomplices of Batman include Lieutenant-turned Commissioner of Gotham Jim Gordon (Oldman) and his armorer and CEO of Wayne enterprises Lucius Fox (Freeman) who is fully aware of Wayne being the masked vigilante. Throughout the duration of the film, we see calamitous explosions, terrific chase scenes and witty smart-liners by the villain. . Nolan immortalized Batman through this flawless endeavour .The film leaps beyond the origins and becomes an engrossing affair. The haunting and visionary Dark Knight soars on the wings of untamed imagination. It is full of surprises you don't see coming",9,0,2,7 July 2013
The Departed," Martin Scorsese's The Departed: The Perfect Bait To Catch The 'Oscar' Shark
","'Lies, Betrayal & Sacrifice. How far will you take it?' the quote clearly describes Martin Scorsese's exceptional cop thriller 'The Departed'. Martin Scorsese voted as one of the best directors ever to be gifted to the film industry, returns back to the gangster genre after a span of 11 years. Goodfellas (1990), Mean Streets (1973), Casino (1995) are few of the illustrations of his master hand in this genre. Inspired from 2002, Hong Kong movie 'Internal Affairs ' The Departed makes the viewers witness assembling of an astral cast altogether. I mean who won't give a nod to the movie which has Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson & Mark Walberg in decisive roles. Screenplay crafted in a well paced & witty manner by William Monahan, the film begins with the director playfully shooting Nicholson in the dark for few scenes as you can just glimpse his out-sized silhouette while everyone else is in the clear view. Scorsese simply wants to symbolize through this that he is the driving force of all the mayhem & destruction; the monstrous devil. 20 minutes post the film starts, you get to know about the title of the film but by then you have already crafted a general picture of the film's plot in your mind; An outstandingly clever move by an outstandingly brilliant director.Frank Costello (Nicholson), the Irish-American Mafioso is the only powerful man holding the reigns of organized crime in Irish neighborhood in South Boston. He influences Collin Sullivan (Damon) by seducing altar boy by few gallons of milk & comic books & Sullivan is trained to be his very own secret agent in the Massachusetts State Police department; the department run by Queenan (Martin Sheen). On the other hand, Leonardo plays Billy Costigan, an honest person from a dishonest family who cannot make it to being a cop owing to his austere family background finally agrees to Queenan's urge for him to be his undercover informer in Costello's gang. After a failed sting operation in spite of Billy tipping the police off, the State Police Department grows quite suspicious of a rat in their own department. Thanks to Sullivan from State Police, even Costello is tad convinced that even he has a police informer in his gang. The entire movie is about how both the organizations make their best to find out the moles around them, finally leading to some shootouts, body counts and unsurpassed scene of carnage. Matt Damon who appears to be a well behaved & a neat cop pertaining to his clean shaved look but sadly isn't. He gets involved with the cop psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) and gets into a live-in relationship with her but finally the love tapers towards destruction in the end. The film however gets us the glimpses of some heart-warming intimacy between the couple. The Departed is a complex story of a paralleled infiltration of organized crime and the police department narrated rather simply as it showcases the idiosyncratic performances of the lead actors & the strong masterstroke of the director. It makes a complicated and potentially convoluted story and delivers it to the audience with sterile clarity. It has the same violence & tension from Goodfellas & Casino minus the narration. However as expected Scorsese has managed to explore the gangster world ahead of the vision & delivered a kaleidoscopic masterpiece. Needless to say, in my view this happens to be Scorsese's best gangster movie till date.",8,0,1,13 December 2013
Psycho," Thrilling & Riveting; Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho creates an impact greater than most of his epic noirs.
","The way films shot in black-and-white portrays itself to the audience and materialize into something more than just a critical acclaimed film is surely alluring to experience. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho might not be my first movie I watched from the 60's era but it's definitely the one creating a greater impact than the other. The movie has pure visceral feel and induces a thrill so powerful that you might find yourself quite intrigued by it. Psycho opens up with a scene with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) in a rented room of cheap hotel in Pheonix. Their apparent actions and conversations give vivid impression that both are currently having an intense love affair and want to get married soon but are unable to do so since they can't afford the expenses involved. Marion is working in an estate agent's office and meets with a client who gives her 40,000 dollars to buy a house for his daughter.A desperate Marion steals 40,000 dollars from the client and flees from the town. Marion, on the run takes refuge in a motel called as Bates Motel, whose business appeared to be in total shambles. Even being strongly confronted by his dominant mother, the owner of the motel Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) warmly welcomes Marion with warm dinner and cosy room to spend the night in. Things turned horribly ugly when Marion gets murdered in the room of the motel by an unknown entity as she gets stabbed multiple times. The unknown entity in the movie will somewhat be perceived by the audience as 'Psycho' and the overall objective of cold-blooded murder however remains a mystery. Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, Psycho is a mystery thriller with the suspense not being kept on hold for long and becomes quite flagrant. Alfred Hitchcock has made an audacious effort to make such a thriller in which the title of being the 'protagonist' vacillates from one person to another quite impressively. You may not be sure who the lead character actually is but you are pretty sure that the film is not a bizarre scramble of sheer ambiguity. A cinephile's experience will spring to life if he doesn't have the prescience of the suspense before. The film is capricious but still thrilling and fantastically riveting. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is worth the encomium and claps. 9 on 10 stars",9,1,2,18 February 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Smart, Adept and Uproarious
","Wall Street happens to be one of the financial districts in New York. It houses one of the largest stock exchanges called the New York Stock exchange along with other financial headquarters. You love the environment in there; it is pretty assumed that you go on a money minting spree. Martin Scorsese's 'The Wolf of the Wall Street' simply puts the emphasis on the Wall Street atmosphere, portraying the real life character of Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio); who was convicted of fraudulent crimes for exploiting the stock market.Craftily scripted by Terence Winter, based on the book called 'Jordan Belfort', Scorsese evinces the character of Jordan Belfort as an orgy youngster having an unstinted appetite for money (earned legally or illegally doesn't matter) and heavily addicted to cocaine, alcohol and sex. On losing his job owing to stock market crash in 1987, Belfort trains a group of good-for-nothing folks to sell some of the useless commodities to some rich high-profile traders. Establishing a new firm called 'Stratton Oakmont', Jordan Belfort creates a befitting milieu to flourish what it is right to be termed as a 'moneymaking business'. Going along too well with the wind of incoming wealth, Belfort divorces his wife Teresa only to marry Naomi; the only girl who can satisfy Belfort's ever growing lust. Scorsese does focus on sizzling intimate moments between the couple. A life rife with drugs, booze, magnificent bungalows, sleek sport cars and libidinous prostitutes slowly comes to a halt when the FBI steps in with their investigation. As showcased in most of the Scorsese films, the entire hurly burly in the major part of the movie is interrupted with planning & effort by the police.Unlike films like 'Taxi driver', 'Casino' & 'Goodfellas', 'The Wolf of the Wall Street' is devoid of the ultimate theme of redemption. In spite of that, the film lends us rolling-on-the floor-laughing moments coupled with sheer display of acting to the point of caricature by Leonardo DiCaprio. The formula of opulence coupled with laughter & poignancy has worked quite well on the celluloid. Matthew McConaughey has a remarkable role as Mark Hanna; the guy who titillates the spark of minting fast money which has ignited in Belfort's mind.Even though having sizeable movie length, it never seems to dull the audience and keeps them in an uplifted mood throughout. The Wolf of the Wall Street is smart, adept and uproarious. A shrewd script blended with high brilliance; Martin Scorsese makes it laudable and discernible among others.",9,1,9,4 January 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Two decades in a masterpiece !!!
","Starring : Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore Directed by : Frank Darabont 1994 American drama directed by Frank Darabont walked without an Oscar to its name but had a lion's share in attaining critical acclaims and attracting the audience to it. This movie proves all its way that films devoid of Oscars can still be counted under a masterpiece.

The film exhibits different prisoners inside Shawshank and how Andy tends to befriend them all except the Sisters (that is what they are called ) who try to kill Andy just to have some little fun. The protagonist is shown up passing his time creating artistic stone carvings and watching sexy Hollywood actresses on the walls in his cell. The film takes u on the ride inside the prison where cops take up entirely over the souls and lives of prisoners. Andy being a banker is plunged into money laundering business by one of the cops and the warden. The warden himself as a man of principles but wait ! inside he is just money- hungry beast. Even with concept of an old prisoner Brooks ( Whitemore ) who has spent 50 years of his life in the prison and gets 'institutionalized' with it and ends up hanging himself to death when being released from Shawshanks adds up to the exciting plot of the film. The film is basically Andy's 20 years of imprisonment inside Shawshanks and his friendship with the fellow inmates and how things inside prison too also gets illegal sometimes. Shawshanks Redemption is a film which has a terrific ending. Watch it once and you will have an urge to watch it again.",10,1,2,19 January 2013
The Conjuring," Creepy & Terrifying...Try Not To Scream !!!!
","Not being a lover of horror films, I never caught up with one in the theatres. The 1973 Academy-Award winner The Exorcist & the Bollywood horror flick Bhoot, directed by RGV was all I had watched from this genre. According to me, both these films had enough visual & sound effects to terrify the audience. As I was going through Bhoot for the second time, I noticed that the main source of terror was the sudden sound effect (irrespective of the screen showing a demonic creature or not) & RGV had used this trick to scare the audiences more than ghostly horrifying visuals.A very similar but an enhanced effect accompanied by some great visual effects is what The Conjuring (2013) stands on. The Saw director James Wan extracted a piece of story from the case files of Warrens and directed a supernatural thriller proving to rather more than just a mere horror film. It had the soul accompanied by a well-defined structure.The film opens up in a remarkable scene where a demonologist Ed Warren & his beautiful clairvoyant wife Lorraine who are paranormal investigators providing rational explanations to strange happenings, investigate a case of the Annabelle doll where a small doll suddenly becomes possessed by the ghost of the 7 year old girl haunting the house of two nurses. The scene remarks the introduction of the two researchers who research & provide solution to malignant ghost invasions in a person or in a accommodation. The film flies back in 1971 where Carolyn & Roger Perron, with their five daughters move into a bungalow in Harrisville, Rhode Island. Right from the day, they settle in the family experiences weird happenings in the house. Their pet dog Sadie is found dead outside the villa, the mother Carolyn gets strange bruises after she wakes up in the morning every day, an unknown entity takes to pulling the daughter's leg every night, the door creaks open mysteriously every now & then. These incidents go on culminating and aggravating as these small strange happenings magnify themselves to reveal large demonic presence in the house. The menacing situation ends up getting so severe and dreadful that out of fear & despair, the couple resort to the Warrens for help.The story is not just about the family of Perrons. The life of Warrens is also showcased parallel with the life of Perrons. The film is totally one-sided that you can predict that the lives of these two families are going to end up meeting at an unfortunate turn. The film is not recommended for people with a weak heart as the scenes are impressive but frightening. The demonic visuals are sudden, unexpected & fear- inducing personifying the directorial talent of James Wan since he succeeds effectively in generating chills down the spine.More enhancing are opening & closing credits in the movie, the weapon most under-utilized in modern cinema as the snapshots from real-life Warren Cases are shown. The film's cinematography also receives thumbs up as the cinematographer John Leonetti uses some swooping shots to capture characters as they run inside the house. The film appears to be a winning horror formula after some previously released horror flicks going deep under the ground. Above all, the director's clear fascination to horror films like Amityville horror, the Poltergeist & the Exorcist is clearly visible in the film. As the film progresses to the latter half, comparisons of The Conjuring to The Exorcist becomes totally unavoidable but the director has lived up to the expectations in The Conjuring & succeeded in giving an extra-ordinary film. For weak hearted people, my message to them is ' Try not to scream folks '.",7,7,15,4 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Perfect Thrill
","Dark Knight Rises is an another riveting and extraordinary Christopher Nolan movie in terms of screenplay and direction. Nolan yet again proves that he is well aware of how to thrill the viewers. The story begins with the entry of new terrorist Bane 8 years after the demise of Gotham's district attorney Harvey Dent. The billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne has lost all his hope to live letting solitude grip him. The viewers tend to get a little hungry for some action but yet again Nolan wont keep you waiting. Spectacular chase sequence,a hand to hand combat between the hero and villain , a terrific Bane master plan to destroy Gotham together induces excitement. Anne Hathway does fairly well job as Selina Kyle, the cat-woman. Hats off for Bale and his superior hand in acting. Overall Dark Knight rises is a must watch for Batman lovers.",8,1,6,10 November 2012
