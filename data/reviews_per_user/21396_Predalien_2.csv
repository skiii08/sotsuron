Alien 3," One of the best in the series!
","Earlier I have read a comment that this movie is a bad apple in the series. Personally, I think it is the best. Yes, Ms. Weaver played an excellent role, but that is not the point. The main point of the movie to me was the queen chestburster implanted in her. I mean, she has a one of the creatures she has been fighting for so long growing in her. Imagine knowing that you have one growing in you ready to break its way out. And the fact that it is a queen burster is ironic. The queens the one responsible for the countless deaths of humans and one is growing in her. Another irony present in the movie is when the dog alien is being born as the bible is read. Almost makes this alien a bit different, yes? The dark mood of the movie and the fact that the entire complex lacks defences gives the movie a bit of suspence. One example is the scenes where the alien is chasing the prisoners through the lead molding hallways. The fact that Ripley dies in the end is almost what makes the movie better. In real life, you don't always make it. But the fact she died with such dignity and honor is what makes the audience have a new 'respect' for her. All in all, this was one of the best!",Null,0,3,13 October 2000
Predator," The Hunters
","This is a great movie. Humans have once thought themselves the supremes of the universe. Not anymore. The hunter has become the hunted. A mysterious creature with cloaking and advanced weapons may seem like the ultimate killing machine, but Dutch (Mr. Arnold S.) pulls off a clever trap. Alien commits suicide and detonates a mini-nuke. Dutch impossibly lives. Some say this is dumb but I think dumb luck is very possible. I think this movie is great so check it out!",Null,0,0,13 October 2000
