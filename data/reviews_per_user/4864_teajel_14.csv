The Expendables 2," A good reunion of the 80's action hero,yet it is also a dull re-hash of the 80's and 90's action movie
","in this sequel of 2010 hit box office 'The Expendable' Stallone has managed to gather all of 80's and 90's famous action star in order to make his action extravagance bigger and better.the action movie is indeed bigger and way more louder than the previous movie with raining of gun blazing thousand of bullets and a large amount of explosive.with an entourage of 80's action hero,this testosterone driven action movie is kind of a detour of some of the most fun and entertaining action movie back in late 80's and early 90's. Watching both Willis and Schwarzeneger argued about their comeback in the movie is fun and also with Norris brief appearance as the Lone Wolf Booker fired up a bazooka is also exciting.unfortunately,these kind of reunion is 'The Expendable 2' all about. the movie itself is kind of a rehash from the 80's and 90's action movie.it is an action movie that tries to become something fresh by combining the old and the new formula of action movie that include the action stars.despite the effort,the movie is failed in term of bringing its promise,instead its becoming a kind of dull and mindless action movie. The story is centered on the group of mercenary lead by its charismatic leader Barney Ross and his second in command Lee Christmas.after their successful mission in liberating a country in south America from an evil dictator.the group were given another mission from Mr.Church that it seems like an ordinary simple dirty job given by Church with a decent pay.Church also introduced a new recruit to the team name Maggie,a tech specialist with military training to the team.after the introduction,they began their new mission given by Church.suddenly the unthinkable happened when they were ambushed and then being taken hostage by another group of mercenary.the ambush ended up killing their new recruit named Billy The Kid,a young kid that joined the expendables after he got out from the military.in the aftermath of this event,Barney and his expendables made a promise to take revenge on the man who had killed Billy The Kid. The classic theme of vengeance and ruthless main villain is the main plot of the movie which is pretty much sum up the 80's style of action genre.while the use of big gun and stylish fighting scene are borrowed from modern action movie.though,its combination didn't bring something new.at one point,there is a feeling of excitement as each of the action hero get back to their roots especially Sly who has managed to do all the action by himself.another surprise that this movie has is the brief appearance of Chuck Norris who eventually come out more than just an ordinary cameo when he appeared in the last battle scene.beside Norris,it is the return of Jean-Claude Van Damme as the main villain that really make the movie become intriguing to watch.his unique accent and high kicks in the final battle really brings out the memories of watching his movie such as 'Universal Soldier'(1992).This sequel could be worst without his appearance as the main villain.although the rest of the movie is basically like any other modern action movie that borrow many reference from another typical of action movie such as 'Takers'(2010) where director Simon West decide to focus on develop each character personality that eventually lead to style of action instead the dept of its character.though,The Expendable is better than Takers because it still has a drama,unlike Takers where the character action is driven only by selfish needs that eventually led up to a story where stupid and obnoxious people trapped in the struggle because of their own ego.fortunately,Sly and West are still concerned about the drama and morality of the story even though there is only several scene that truly depict that kind of morality.despite all the mind blowing and over-exaggerate special effects,the characters still have capabilities to connect to the audience with a few punchline of typical humor that simple but effective at the same time.all of the humor is naturally flow in each conversation among the mercenary,even Lundgren could be funny at some occasion.having these kind of humor is one of the reason that makes this sequel is fun to watch,especially for entertainment.but for those who expect great action movie where there was many twist and unpredictability,'The Expandable 2' is far from that region.instead,the movie is aimed toward the people who loves 80's action movie with its clique.especially for those who love an action movie that is driven by suspense and violent,look no further than this group of old action hero.",5,1,5,26 August 2012
Iron Man 2," Pure entertainment but lack of originality from the first one
","first of all there are two words to describe this movie Totally Awesome!!! there i say it despite review from many critics or gossip by people who already watched it at the screening or in other country mainly in Asia because they've got an early release date, ignored their gossip or critics review.In my opinion this movie was one of most excited,entertaining superhero movie ever made so far for those people who already watch iron man before or a big fan from it's comic book they totally going to loved this one maybe for quality yes it's not as good as the first one but it's not a really terrible movie like they say there still a lot of terrible superhero movie out there and this is not include Iron man 2 was a good sequel it's not great but it's good and really worth watching from the special,visual,sound effect was perfect but what makes this movie it is not as good as the first one or not surpass the critics expectation because a few stupid scene and lot of slapstick humor that just really ruined this movie like the humor for example instead of clever and funny comedy like the first one this sequel turned it into a stupid slapstick comedy not just that if the first one all of the joke and humor was perfectly pitch by all of the character that doesn't happen in this one some even try hard to be funny and that just really annoying for us to watch and that just really ruined this movie potential and not just that some scene just really stupid to watch like there is one time happy tony stark driver driving around the circuit of formula one with a ordinary car and that just really stupid and don't make any sense at all and because of stupid scene like that really make this movie looks bad and one of the most important one bad editing really really bad one and because two of these minor mistake favreau did really break it's quality and lack of originality that the first one had to offer maybe he's in hurry making this or maybe the budget that was being cut off effect the final picture all of this was just really sad and destroyed it potential to be as good as dark night or even better.the acting was good and a breakthrough performance from Sam Rockwell as Justin hammer really lived up this sequel as usual Robert Downey delivered it everything from it start until finish and a little disappointment from don cheadle as Lt.James Rhodes replacing Terrence Howard other than that a surprise good performance from scarlet Johanson as the sexy shield agent black widow as well as mickey Rourke for playing a vengeance full scientist Ivan vanko despite all of that minor mistake this movie is really worth watching for and just really awesome superhero movie in the end let just hope for the best for this movie to do well in the box office so iron man franchise didn't end up just like that despite all of the bad review or people talking that is not as good as the first one i am just has a big expectation about this franchise to be great and i hope all of that could change in the next iron man movie (if it's going to be made)and favreau should direct again to proof those critic that has underestimate him in this movie and make the most awesome superhero movie ever.",6,3,11,4 May 2010
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games is thrilling,exciting,and Adventurous with its subject deeper than teenage romance.
","The Hunger Games has an interesting story about the future of humanity that is seen through brave teenage girl whose played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence.beside top notch cast assemble,Ross witty direction in creating a dilemma between each character with serious tone and teenage romance which bring some comfort in term of story telling about the subject that is far deeper than teenage romance.Set in the future,the once renowned and powerful country has changed forever after the rebellion that broke out in recent years.the result of the rebellion was a nation that has been divided into 12 district and tradition in which a boy and girl between the age of 12 and 18 are selected from 12 district to participate in a dangerous game where each of them are being forced to fight to death on live television where it is broadcast across the twelve district,the game that was named 'The Hunger Games'. The selection of the participant or 'Tribute' are choose on the annual lottery known as ' The Reaping'.as the the next lottery for 74th annual Hunger Games begin in District 12,which is the poorest district among the whole district.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 16 year old girl living in the district along with her little sister Primrose(Willow Shields) whose odd of being chosen as one of the tribute is close to impossible,However the odds are suddenly change when her sister Primrose are chosen to become district 12 tribute.Knowing that her sister didn't have any change of surviving the hunger games,Katniss Everdeen bravely substitute herself with her sister as the tribute of district 12 by becoming a volunteer for her sister sake. beside Katniss as the female tribute,another tribute that is chosen to represent the district is a baker's son named Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).they are brought up into the capital with the well dressed Effie Trinket by riding Capitol fastest train,during their journey into the capitol, Effie introduce them to Haymetch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) that happened to be one of the winner of the hunger games and he is also take part as their teacher.what Lies ahead for Katniss and Peeta in the Hunger Games?and How they are going to survive the brutal and violent Hunger Games?The Hunger Games has a strong start in the beginning especially during the scene where Katniss little sister Primrose are chosen to become one of the tribute,which emotionally showed the conflict and dilemma that is going to become her motivation in the future. After dramatic separation between Katniss and her beloved sister Primrose,we are showed the Capital which visually packed with lots of CGI and glamorous set of decoration.from the realistic district 12 into the imaginative Capitol as how the future Metropolitan City looks like was one of rules that The Hunger Games has quickly set up the rules of Fantasy and Science fiction which tell the audience that the movie has something more than just drama with its adolescent female as its main character.But what makes The Hunger Games different than any others kind of similar movie is how the combination of serious drama and teen romance manage to capture the theme of the movie which is deeper than a young adult being forced into harsh reality when everything is controlled by rich people who didn't have any moral value nor sense of compassion.without over-the-top action sequence The Hunger Games flows naturally with the character development and solid acting from the cast of young actors and teen star like Josh Hutcherson and rising star Liam Hamsworth whose acting skill are far better than Pattinson and Lautner in Twilight has saved the movie from becoming another twilight rip-off.but all the credit should goes for Jennifer Lawrence whose captivating performance and method acting is what makes the movie looks more mature as a movie that primely aims for teenage audience.Lawrence acting credibility is proved when she got Oscar nomination in last year Oscar in Winter's Bone where she played similar character of an adolescent young adult who are being forced take responsibility as head of the family and surviving the cruel reality.to have played strong independent female character like Katness Everdeen is no difficult task for Lawrence since her past experience has definitely brought her own perspective when it comes to played this kind of character.her fans will be craving for more and audience may take more attention toward this promising young actress.The Hunger Games delivers all of its promise,from exciting adventure to witty and dazzling heroine that take place in a gloomy future of United States in post-modern warfare which the visual effect that was used is not over the top so the fantasy world such the Capitol still has some of its realistic aspect as future metropolitan yet it is still imaginative.",8,1,5,9 May 2012
American Hustle," 'American Hustle',O.Russel tasteful and brilliant takes on the line of morality issue.
","The Endeavour of a stylish and captivating acting make up for a very much interesting and fun around joyride with some sense of morality issue. In the line between right and wrong lies a complex sense of pleasure and justice. There is a sort of entanglement that sometimes confusing and hard to choose one 'right' thing over another. The bigger picture is the world is not black and white, yet certainly 'grayish'. A theme like this is nothing new in the world of Hollywood cinema, either in the past or present. It is almost revisited on a yearly basis and most of the time it turns out to be a let down or plays out on over pretentiousness. Fortunately enough, this is not one of it due to a clever storyline and bold direction of David O Russel.While it isn't entirely based on any factual history or rather infamous past events, Some of it is inspired by an FBI operation in early 1980 called 'Abscam', which involved a fake Arabian from a part of New York to trapped some major player who conducted big corruption that eventually led to exposure and prosecution around those circle of involvement. Whether it was a success or a bust, the story didn't focus on its truth. Instead, its revolves around an experienced con-man named Irving (Christian Bale) in verge of pulling the biggest con of his entire career of conning innocence people in the purpose of setting up a bait for FBI to trap a corrupt, yet naive Major Carmine (Jeremmy Renner) from city of Camden. As Irving prepares for the meeting with Carmine, he is washing his face along with the calm before song 'Horse with No Name' by famous early 70's folk band America. With helps from his attractive mistress named Sydney and FBI Agent named Richie who planned the idea and controlled the operation. As the meeting went down Irving, Sydney, and Richie sit down with the major to persuade him to take the money that they have planned before. In a sudden way, the mayor begin to feel uncomfortable by Richie nervousness and resulted in his rejection toward it before leaving in emotion. Afterwards, Irving immediately angered and blaming Richie about the failure. In reverse plot of show and tell, Irving then describe how he eventually walk into the situation. In a subtle way of how he began as a con before his first encounter with Sydney and his entrapment of a false marriage with his obnoxious wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), how he manage to maintain it because of his beloved son and his principal of playing it safe.It opens up in a very stylish way as of Scorsese gangster movie. one particular that closely resembled is 'Casino'. The three musketeers of con artist that consist of Christian Bale,Bradley Cooper,and Amy Adams are already a scene to be captivated. As it capture how these three gifted Actors enters the picture before they goes on to the roller coaster ride of mixed emotions. as the story progress,it becomes prominence that the star-studded cast has seamlessly integrate within each scene. The leading character arch is Christian Bale brilliant portrayal of Irving. Bale's method acting signature hasn't been tiresome or predictable, instead his control of the character has elevated the film emotion through his given perspective. Whether in his downfall of self-entrapment in relationship or when his money making trickery hit a jackpot His performance could easily conveys sympathy and sometimes a necessary laugh. Another high remark goes to Amy Adams captivating performance as Bale's partners in crime. Adams could easily switch from being witty into more dramatic approaches toward her character. another example of brilliant method acting is shown through the show-stealing performance from Jennifer Lawrence as Irving repulsive wife, yet also annoyingly funny most of the times. a credit is due for Lawrence perfect comic timing and moody portrayal. it is one of the reason why the movie is also genuinely hilarious and honestly ironic. in part of another supports,Bradley Cooper is also a solid addition for the cast excellence. despite being overlook,his witty improvisation and straight forward sarcasm is also due for a credit.",8,0,2,25 January 2014
The Village," Fail to archive it's potential
","The village it definitely a unique movie with fresh mixture of horror,thriller and drama try to create something new in horror film and it has a lot of great idea and potential to become a creative horror movie with it's own fresh thriller that he gave to his story and with great twist in it but because several flaw mostly in his cinematography that looks like an amateur shoot taken by guy whose done The Blair witch project especially some scene that will take some time later in the movie maybe because it seems that the DP wanted to create something different in his movie by combining old style and modern horror scene but turn out to be total failure for this movie some important scene are becoming blurry because of this and that makes the plot become lost and the character looks like confused with their own plot and the editing is also failed in middle of it started to looks like the Blair witch project combining with other old school horror movie the movie itself that started promising but due to lack of some of these major flaw M night has failed to capture his own well written story to the screen and eventually lead to a total disaster that destroy both of the story major twist and mystery that makes this creepy and mysterious in the first place and looks like a cheap horror movie near the addendum of the story and with some bad editing that made his own vision and the movie recipe turn to be destroy this movie potential but although of it disaster recipe at least the acting was great especially Howard who played the blind girl but with a kind and brave characteristic and to Jaqiuen phoenix as a very mysterious and very curious man that try to solve the town problem also for it support cast Adrien Brody did a pretty good job as a problematic village boy whose suffer a mental disorder and as the many other actor did a pretty good job too and in the end at least the casting and the beautifully musical score still save this movie from becoming a total recipe for disaster",6,0,1,4 June 2010
Drive," an exhilarating and stylish action movie from start to finish.
","Driver is a man who usually being hired for any kind of job that related to driving. his identities is mysterious since he is only been called driver or kid by his boss through the entire movie. In the opening scene, a discovery shot was made to show the viewer an action that focus on the driver slowly make some kind of preparation on the bed. the scene is being shot with a style of film noir, showing a mysterious man wearing a jacket. after the scene, an opening credit was played with a retro music as its soundtrack.it is clear that 'Drive' is not the typical modern Hollywood action movie, judging from the beginning of the movie and the opening credit. some viewer will find this weird because its like watching an old episode of the 60's or early 70's TV series. I find this to be unique because there were few director that open up his action movie with film noir style and retro music nowadays. In the time where action movie is dominated by fast car or a group of flamboyant entourage, 'Drive' come out with something different. while many filmmaker use many action clique or trying to imitate the other successful action film. director Nicholas Winding Refn didn't follow this pattern of typical action movie, instead of stealing or imitating, he try to experiment the action genre with his own movie that simply entitled 'Drive'.by using retro music as the film musical background and the camera technique of film noir he has made an exciting retro style and post noir action movie. as the result, he was awarded a prize for best director on the canes festival. it is an evidence that the critique appreciate his vision, but other critique such as veteran top film critique Leonard Maltin perceive his vision differently. he said that director Nicholas Winding Refn has chosen style over substance. some of his saying were partially true,at some degree the substance of the movie is kind of a letdown since the plot of the story was a little too linear and also the character driver seems pretty much empty in term of personality during the first part of the movie. despite his good criticism, I slightly disagree with him because I thought that sometimes a good action movie didn't need any high concept or an emotional aspect on its substance or essence. Sometime it is just need a cohesive unique style of filmmaking that was creative and original just like director Nicholas Winding Refn managed to poured his creative vision in this movie.Driver was well acted by Ryan Gosling,he is a men who just wanted to get the job done,but all of that change when he meet Irene played by Carrey Mulligan and her son Benicio. Irene was currently living on her own until his husband Standard Gabriel came back from jail. after falling in love with Irene, Driver has change the way he see his life because for the first time he felt the need to protect and care for Irene and her son. Driver,a lone wolf was finally found some meaning in her life. This kind of story has some similarity with some of the classic Clint Easwood film where in the end the lonely man find the love of his life or people that has some meaning for him. Everything seem turn out great when Irene and her son has shown affection toward driver and he also satisfied with his current life. Suddenly everything change when Irene husband standard Gabriel got back from the prison to stay with his wife Irene. not knowing the unexpected, it turns out that he had trouble with some criminal while he serve his prison time. as the result he has endangered not only his life but also Irene and his son Benicio life after the criminal threatened their life. the desperate Gabriel come to driver to ask for his help in cleaning up the trouble that he had made in his past by getting a job from a thug named Cook who somehow has a connection with Gabriel. Driver agree to help him,later in the movie he and Gabriel become trapped in a heist that resulted in the death of Gabriel. Knowing that he was being trapped, he traced the criminal job that was given by Cook and it turned out that the job was set up by a guy named Nino played by Ron Pearlman who happened to be his beloved boss Shannon current client and business partner along with Shannon long time friend Bernie played by Albert Brooks. The first part of the movie started rather slow until its brilliant climax where driver killed both men that was trying to assassinate him in the motel. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Segel managed to shoot the action scene perfectly with a moving discovery shoot and he finished up the scene with zooming the driver while he shot the shotgun toward the last thug on the front door. It was a great action scene in which the film changed its slow pace into fast pace action movie through the rest of the movie.all the acting was solid enough to entertain viewer , but the breakout role lies in Ryan Gosling where he played the stunt driver turn into some sort of anti-hero. While Carey Mulligan also bring solid performance despite her short time in the movie.as usual Ron Pearlman get the job done as a supporting actor even though his character Nino, a confident old mob that use a lot of swearing through its screen time. last but not least, comedian Albert Brooks also becoming a well-worth addition for the entire cast playing Shannon long time friend Bernie whose character was the only one that has a long conversation with many character in the movie. 'Driver' was an exhilarating action movie that is worth a watch and an almost pitch perfect action when it comes to the style of the movie.",9,2,5,26 September 2012

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The girl with awesome tattoo- a dark mysterious well made crime movie
","Girl with dragon tattoo comes as a good mystery film that full of suspense and thriller and with a excitement like a b-movie this ambitious mystery crime drama also delivered it with an unique and interesting central character that deeply acted by a tremendous actor The story follows  a ambitious journalist named Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who worked for the magazine Millennium, lost a libel case brought on by corrupt Swedish industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström. The magazine & he were ordered to pay for damage and Blomkvist was due to head for prison in the next few months.While waiting to serve his sentence, Blomkvist was approached by Henrik Vanger's representative. After some hesitation, he came to see Mr. Vanger, the frail & wealthy octogenarian of The Vanger group, who lived in a remote island, surrounded by other family members' houses.It turned out Mr. Vanger wanted to hire Blomkvist to unearth the truth behind his niece Harriet's apparent murder some forty years ago when she was sixteen. Although her body was never found, Mr. Vanger believed it was murder because that day there was an accident on the only bridge that linked the island with the mainland. The bridge was closed, nobody could get out & nobody could get on the island. Yet, Harriet just vanished into thin air. There's not a day gone by which Mr. Vanger didn't think about her.Before going to the island to see Mr. Vanger, Blomkvist didn't know that he was being followed & photographed by Lisbeth Salander, a punk who made a living as a computer hacker.The young woman had problems of her own. Due to crime committed in her youth ( later we learnt that when she was much younger, she had set fire to a man, presumably her abusive father, in a car ), she had to report to a guardian who controlled her money. One day, he forced her to give him a blow job or else he threatened to accuse her of causing trouble and have her put into a psychiatric hospital. When Blomkvist found out his PC had been hacked into he was able to trace back to Salander & came to her place. He persuaded her to collaborate with him in the investigation of Mr. Vanger's niece. Together they dug up more troubling and disturbing information. The story of course was perfectly written with a lot of twist in it and make it mysteriously dark disturbing at some point making this a really good crime movie with it's own charm. And also with a weird chemistry that later builds between  Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth salander that also make the movie more exciting and fun in a bizarre way make the movie character looks like a dark moody and bizarre version of starsky and hutch.    I really recommend this to anybody who like a crime drama movie with an interesting central character and with an acting that really lives up the movie this is really a must watch crime drama on it's own creativity",7,2,2,21 July 2010

The Woman in Black," the movie is haunting,yet it is also dull and overlong.
","'The Woman in Black' is a movie that built its horror based on dark and Gothic atmosphere.it can be found on its haunted mansion near the classic English village. the beginning of the movie is filled with dark nuance surrounding the house that the main character Arthur Gibbs played brilliantly by Daniel Radclife tried to sell the house as his latest job as an advocate. while he is still haunted by the unexpected death of his wife because of the miscarriage.in this case Arthur was desperate to move on with his life by getting the job done. Little did he know that his latest job of selling old house will be influenced by an eerie local superstitious and conservative villager that were still believed in evil spirit. Despite the warning from the local villager, Arthur eagerly wanted to inspect the house that he tried to sell and also because his firm demand. Most of the people in the village were hostile toward him because of his visitation to the house except for the wealthy couple who accepted him in their house. It was later found that they also have just lost their son in an awful accident. Later in the movie the husband help Arthur doing his job in inspecting the house. the premise of the story is scary and horrific, in which the superstitious surrounding the house. most of the filming was shot in location instead of the studio, the director intend to bring the horror more realistic aspect which is works for the most part. What director James Watkins managed to do in here is building up the tone and mood through the movie from setting up the haunted house and provide a hostile villager that still believed in ghost and phantoms. The plot of the story is slowly build up toward the climax which bring up more sense of terror as the tenacious Arthur Gibbs explore the alleged curse house. Most of the credit goes to Daniel Radclife in his portrayal of Arthur Gibbs, his acting in this movie is convincing that he has lost someone important to him. Judging by the constant melancholic expression on his face through the movie, he understand what his character demand in the movie. Since playing Harry Potter, Radclife has moved forward from a teen star to become an actual dramatic actor. The evidence can be found in this movie, in which he has became more mature as dramatic actor. For the most part, 'The Woman in Black' is not a terrible horror movie because it has a solid ghost stories that felt like a dark English folklore and a haunting location which provide the thick dark atmosphere through the movie. Unfortunately, it is far from great either because the film move with a slow pace that resulted in becoming dull and overlong.it takes half the time to reach the main plot of the movie which turn out slightly disappointing.

","it is the most dark and intricate in the trilogy,yet it also inspiring at some point.regardless,the plot of the story is slow in the beginning unlike its previous movie The Dark Knight which is a fast pace psychological thriller with its well structured and complicated story.nonetheless,the slow start builds up into its heart-pumping and emotional climax.it has shown how far Nolan has been transform the dark crusader from a cliché superhero into this iconic character that has more depth and maturity. 8 years after the death of Harvey Dent,Gotham has become a city that is much more safe and peaceful.the city also filled with rich and successful businessman,politician,and entrepreneur.without knowing the fact that there are still some people whom still try to wreck havoc on Gotham city.while the city of Gotham has been saved from many crime lord and murderer,Batman (Christian Bale) who is responsible for the peace time in Gotham took the blame for the death of Harvey Dent.being disappeared from the city watch,Bruce has decided to stop becoming his alter ego and still depressed with the lost of Rachel. in the other part of the world,a group of mercenary led by Bane (Tom Hardy) had been in preparation for hijacking an airplane in order to kidnapped a Russian scientist who aboard the airplane.after finishing the preparation,he quickly hijacked the airplane by ordering his man to kill the pilot and took a hostage of the Russian scientist.leaving the plane crash so government official couldn't find the evidence link to their action. back on Wayne Manor,a formal party of the Wayne enterprise is held without the appearance of Bruce.with only Alfred (Michael Caine) who greeted the guest.he then ordered a maid to bring food to Bruce in his bedroom.with curiosity,she entered the bedroom and walked across the bedroom until she found an area of archery practice.suddenly,an arrow shoot from behind.she quickly turn her back and found Bruce Wayne appeared in front of her.with an exaggerated expression,she got panic.as Bruce walking toward her,she quickly kick Bruce walking stick and left him unbalanced.revealing her true identity as Catwoman (Anne Hateway),a famous cat burglar that has been stealing from the rich people of Gotham. with an additional character of villain,it is certainly bring an intriguing plot of the story.even so,the introduction of the new character is rather slow than the previous dark knight which quickly bring out the Joker as the main villain in the early scene.except for Bane who has been introduced in the first scene with much similar action sequence as in the dark knight.still,the plot is rather really slow for Nolan previous batman movie which for some is a bit odd even annoying looking at the sudden change of the film pace.despite the slow build-up,it has an ambient of mystery surrounding the early scene where Catwoman was introduced on Wayne manor just like in his other thriller. a sense of film noir is existed in this early scene which is rather bold for superhero movie,since this kind of movie are generally express for action and suspense even in the beginning of the movie.nevertheless,it was an unique approach to the film especially with the fact that the film is going to be the last of his bat trilogy.even without the used of 3D camera,'The Dark Knight Rises' is a visual spectacle that wouldn't be forgotten in years to come. in 2005,Batman Begins was the first remake of Batman.nevertheless,it was more of a re imagine because 'Batman Begins' was vastly different from Burton take on Batman. Christopher Nolan,that had a reputation as a filmmaker and screenwriter thanks to his acclaimed first feature Memento in 2002.his films are mostly a fast pace psychological thriller with unusual mind-bending twist that made it unpredictable,also most of his film are centered around the theme of obsession and paranoia.he was definitely not the average filmmaker that had entrusted with a film about superhero. fortunately,the superhero was Batman,which has unique storytelling comparing to the other DC character.its medium contained a sense of genuine thriller which was suitable for Nolan style of film,considering his first feature film.as the result,the batman remake was not only a good remake but also a redefining of the Batman stories.the film was dark and twisted,yet it also a film about lost and redemption that was bold and inspiring.it earned many critical praise from Critics because of its new sense of realism that barely found in superhero movie.top critics like Roger Ebert was fascinated by the film that he said 'The movie works dramatically in addition to being an entertainment. There's something to it. ' and other critics like Peter Travers said 'Nolan keeps the emphasis on character, not gadgets. Gotham looks lived in, not art-directed.' praised Travers for Nolan's vision of Gotham city that looked very much alive and realistic.not only the critics,the new batman also spawned many new fans and satisfied fan boys.nonetheless, it was a triumph for Nolan as he successfully resurrected the iconic character. 3 years later,a sequel of Nolan's batman was released which entitled 'The Dark Knight'. The movie was even more dark than its previous movie thanks to Heath Ledger brilliant portrayal of the Joker.its story was also more complicated and it was very well structured.nevertheless,it was the best superhero ever made.both critics and fans have agreed on this statement.and for the second time,Nolan's batman has earn many praised from many top critics,especially Roger Ebert who said that 'Batman' isn't a comic book anymore.Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy.' other critics like Michael Philips also praised Nolan for taking the batman as a pulp to a very high level. in the end,whether 'The Dark Knight Rises' is less perfect than 'The Dark Knight' or even 'Batman Begins'. it was an epic final curtain of the best superhero trilogy ever made.a prove that even superhero movie can be made into an unforgettable cinematic spectacle with the right filmmaker.",9,2,5,23 July 2012

Although its focal point lies within the chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johanson. Though much credit goes to Phoenix subversive portrayal as Theodore Johanson subtly voice bring much necessary wits and personality into Samantha. her lending voice is one of importance toward Samantha poignant connection with Theodore. While Amy Adams manage to relish every moment of her limited screen time. being spoken some of the film memorable dialog. Adams brief moment is momentarily significance. all of the cast seems fitted with their character, even Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde short appearance still left some impression.It is hard enough to find the bad faults within the film, because of Spike Jonze flawless visual and great acting. although the resolution between Theodore and Samantha is fairly obvious, it even reeks a little pretentious. nonetheless, it revels into this poetic and poignant endearment it was a 'beautiful pretentiousness' indeed. the plot is also kept at deliberate pace, which is part of Jonze signature approach for whatever reason. though his slow pacing has given us some space to reflect the character and its parallel reality. simply put,every moment of visual brilliance is enough to be cherish in this thoughtful futuristic analogy.",9,1,2,13 February 2014
