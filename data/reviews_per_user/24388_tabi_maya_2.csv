The Ring," See the original Japanese version and see the movie the way it should be.
","First, even if u don't believe in the supernatural, the Japanese story-line was much more detailed, flawless, and just plain Good. But if u didn't believe in the supernatural or at least fear the unknown, like SO many do in one form or another, then u shouldn't have been the slightest bit un-nerved by this movie. The Japanese version, like many eastern countries and their religions, may seem to delve too deep in the supernatural side for most of modern America. Especially for those who need an explanation for everything.But even the thought of Sadako (Samara) being conceived from a 'demon seed', so to speak, is not so crazy as to make the movie less enjoyable. Even the BIBLE says that the Philistine giants (Goliath of David and Goliath) were born from women who were impregnated by angels (or maybe Demons if u consider they are 'fallen angels'). So, anyone with a spiritual side can just feel the skin crawling, un-nerving, spiritual disturb this movie gives. And while the American version obviously had better special effects, such as the distorted faces and Samara herself (her eye... eww), I personally found it scarier to see the realistic fear on the real faces. Not the physically impossible distortions the US version put in for cheap thrills. If you enjoyed the US version, I HIGHLY recommend u see the original. Just be open minded to the fact that it probably only had a fraction of the budget, which just adds to the awe in how good it is.",Null,1,3,22 July 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," VERY funny movie...HIGHLY recommended
","First the bad (though not truly bad at all): As I was watching this movie, I immediately knew the story as Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  This story is definitely not an original piece. In that aspect I was disappointed that credit wasn't given.  I would have seen it much sooner if it were the case, because that is my favorite book.  They call '10 Things I Hate About You' a modern adaptation of Taming of the Shrew, but for anyone who's read it, the movie barely resembles the story.  Bridget Jones's resemblance, however, is so plain and obvious, yet wasn't credited; except on IMDb.  Part 2 is sure to prove whether this writer has the ability to originate a plot.Now the good: The humor was definitely original and HILARIOUS.  This movie actually made me laugh out loud... Something that most comedies today can't get me to do.  And I'm not a super serious person, on the contrary, I can be a total ham sometimes.  But this movies shows how foolish you can look when you're desperate, and this through the person's own private thoughts as written in her diary. It makes for some GREAT comedy. Ren√©e Zellweger does a great job and stays in character wonderfully throughout the movie.  While another comment said Colin Firth was wooden, I happen to think differently. His character was quiet and actually somewhat oppressed by his colleague/girlfriend. But I think he did a good job of not letting this slip into cold and cruel.  I'm not particularly attracted to him, but after this movie I fell in love (not literally, silly. ^_^).  And I have actually watched other movies of his before this... so I'd say he did a great job.
Besides the total jacking of Ms. Austen's masterpiece, I'd say it's rather original comedy. 7 out of 10 for lack of story originality.",Null,0,0,24 August 2004
