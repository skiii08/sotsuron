The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Wow, what a phenomenal movie.
","The perks of being a Wallflower is without doubt one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time. Everything from the Characters to the Setting was excellent and I find it difficult to fault at all. The soundtrack in my opinion was superb, and fitted the theme of the movie excellently. (though I can see how it doesn't suit everyone's taste). It may come across as I am being biased to this film, but as a person who hasn't read the book, I can honestly say it was fantastic as a film on it's own. It has definitely made me want to read the source material. All of the actors I thought played the parts very well and at some select points on the film, I found myself empathising with Charlie on multiple occasions. This film will make you laugh, cry, and intrigue you for the time it is on and make you think about it long after the credits roll. Overall a superb film and well worthy of a watch for most audiences. Please, please, please bear my thoughts in mind and go and see this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10, Easily.
