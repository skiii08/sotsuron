The Blair Witch Project," Wow
","I saw this movie after the backlash of the hype.  Afterwards I waited for the 'Stupid!' comments to subside.  But Wow, this movie FREAKED ME OUT!!!! I knew it wasn't going to be great camera work, but it seemed to make it real.  It kinda rambled a bit, but the last 5 minutes....  Let me put it to you this way: I had to bring the nite-lite from the bathroom to my room. The sense of fear that is SO gradual; it just freaked me right out.",Null,0,1,6 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What's the big idea?
","This movie was so disappointing!  The major differences between Phantom Menace and SW 4,5 and 6 is that Phantom Menace puts you to sleep. Taxation? Why don't I just watch CNN? The only thing I liked about this film was the fight at the end.  That was something you could get interested in. But Please!  Jar Jar Binks and Miss Personality? And where, people, is the plot?  Star Wars phantom menace tries to be like it's sequels, but it's boring story and non-charismatic characters just don't cut it.",Null,0,1,1 July 1999
Blade," so bad

That Thing You Do!," Hence my name......
","This is truly my favorite movie of all time!  The story, the performances, EVERYTHING!  Sure, it may have it's cheesy moments, but they all work well in creating the -happy innocent- atmosphere.Geez, I don't know how to write about this without sounding like everybody else!!...  I'm glad that Tom Hanks decided to write about something happy in a time where so-called *good* movies are all depressing.Plus, Tom Everett Scott is HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!One little blurb is not going to sum up why I love this movie, so I'll tell you I gave it 10/10.",10,0,0,20 July 1999
Armageddon," Waste of time!
","If I weren't with friends, I would have walked out of this movie.  There's laughable amounts of explosions, BAD acting (especially Liv 'my dad's aerosmith, CAST ME' Tyler), and INCREDIBLY CHEESY moments to get us teary eyed.  And was it just me who noticed....  That even though the scenes go too quickly, the movie never ended??",1,1,3,20 July 1999
