It," another freddy krueger (?)
","I like how the scary tension were made in this film. From one scene to the another, the pace of horror really intense. It's like you couldn't get away from this hideous clown wherever you go.And along with the story lines, I find out that there are some kind of similarities between Pennywise the Dancing Clown with the Freddy Krueger. If people were pay a good attention, there's a small easter egg that might light your bulb. It is smart and good I think :)I'm totally in love with this movie",7,4,16,6 September 2017
