","{WARNING: This is a spoiler...and the sarcasm is heavy}I, like many others, was very disappointed with this film.  Now before you skip by this let me say that I was not expecting any of the glitzy 'Hollywood Horror' effects...no flashing lights, no witch, no blood, no gore.  I didn't want the shock value that 'typical' horror movies give you. What I was expecting was genuine fear.  I wanted to walk out of the movie with the biggest forest phobia ever...were talking one major foilage fear. I wanted to have nightmares, and not be able to sleep.Explain some things to me;  what is so terrorizing about the cheesy squeeling sound in the background???  You know, Casper the Ghost had almost the same sound...and I never saw the tagline 'scary as hell' for that.  And the sticks in the trees...OH NO! An evil Girl Scout troop....RUN!!!  And the piles of rock...yes, rocks strike fear in even the bravest of hearts.  And as far as the shaking tent...um...ever been camping before..it's called wind. (or one of the crew...whichever).  Another thing...that bloody marshmallow in the piece of flannel shirt...it's supposed to be a 'part' of Josh, right?  Tell me then, just where is the anatomically correct placement of a marshmallow???  And they all believed it!  Did it never occur to them (the characters) that this was the best ever practical joke of a boring small town??? One of my biggest problems with this film is the ever existent need to get every freaking minute of the 'terror' on film.  Now, I realize that these were supposed to be film students ...and Heather was supposed to be really hard-core ...but COME ON...who would film their demise rather than get the heck out of Dodge???  It just wasn't believable...not one iota.I can't say that I blame them for all the hype...you gotta do something to bring the audience(s) in...I was just VERY disappointed.  I didn't find it brilliant..or anything else.  I got really tired of Heather's attitude and screaming, Josh's apathy, and Mike's...well, jerk-ness.  It just grew old WAY too fast.  I just could not get into the movie, and it has nothing to do with lack of imagination.  I just didn't believe in the characters, or the plot, or the 'fear'.It didn't move me...unless you count my time trying to find the collector's edition of 'The Blair Witch Barf Bag'.  I think the worst part of it all was the hour I spent sitting on the floor in the hall of the theater (with 50 other people) waiting to make sure I got a seat.  My Suggestion: wait for the video..and only waste $3. Plus, this way you can stop the movie every fifteen minutes to go throw-up.",Null,1,2,8 September 1999
