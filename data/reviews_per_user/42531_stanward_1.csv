Angels & Demons," So graphic
","The violence and gore in this movie is insane. For a PG-13 rated movie I was shocked by the content and would highly recommend a R rating. There are graphic depictions of suicide, murder and torture in this movie are really bad and disturbing.The overall movie itself is ok. It builds little suspense although the plot, like the other movies in the franchise, is confusing and over complicated. It dose boast star power but this dose not result in a good film. I say it's average but I wouldn't recommend it.",4,1,4,21 March 2018
