Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Am I the only one who noticed how totally stupid this film was?
","I went to see this film with two friends, who told me that this would be the funniest movie I had ever seen. Needless to say, my expectations were quite high. What followed was what the most childish, silly, and unfunny bunch of crap that I have ever encountered. This is like 'Jerky Boys' in a middle eastern country. There was no plot, no storyline, and the fake accents became quite irritating and distracting after about 5 minutes. Talk about overrated, this one takes the cake. Had I known that you can get rich pulling stupid pranks on people and talking with a fake accent, I could've gotten rich when I was like 12 years old. If you haven't rented it or bought it yet, DON'T, save your money. But then again, the public readily buys 'Lady GaGa' CD's also, so apparently taste isn't something our society is big on anymore............",1,3,6,19 January 2010
Dawn of the Dead," Very disappointing remake of a classic
","I watched this film for the first time recently, and I have to say, I was very disappointed. This film was clearly made for the '20-something' MTV crowd who is more into films with instant gratification than anything that might require some thought. The fast zombies made it seem even more unbelievable and silly (why would dying make a 400 pound woman all of a sudden be able to run faster than Carl Lewis in his prime?), and the characters were incredibly one-dimensional and quite frankly, boring. The plot line is so silly that a 3rd grader could have done better. To have the ending shown during the final credits was completely ridiculous. The film started off with some promise, and could have had a satisfying ending, but for some reason, the producers chose to obliterate the entire cast and leave nothing at all to the imagination. A waste of time. 3 stars out of 10.",3,3,6,25 April 2006
Crash," Horrific Politically Correct Propaganda Film
","This film is as big a politically correct propaganda film as anything by that windbag Michael Moore. The stories in this movie are reminiscent of a bad 'Fantasy Island' episode that was written by a far left wing hack. This movie treats stereotypes in a way that speaks to the viewer like he is a two year old. I found this very offensive to not only my intelligence, but to my beliefs as well. I don't like having someone else's social ideas jammed down my throat, to be honest. I was disappointed not only with the quality and (lack of) plot in this film, but also in myself for paying good money to see this trash. If you want to see something along these lines, check out some of Michael Moore's slop.",1,17,29,23 February 2006
I Am Legend," A Good Film, But Could Have Been Better
","I just saw this film and I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I expected some kind of cross between 'The Last Man On Earth', and 'The Omega Man' (the 2 previous film versions of this story), but instead it was more like a cross between '28 Days Later' and 'Dawn of the Dead'. I didn't like the fact that Neville really wasn't a hunter of the infected, like in the previous films. In this one he is just trying to survive while trying to cure the virus. He only really kills the beasts when he is forced to, and they really weren't very easy to kill. I think there should have been more action in this film, and more interactions between Neville and the 'undead'. Having said all of this, Will Smith definitely turns in one of his finest acting performances, if not his finest, and there are some great moments in this film. Overall, I would say this film is definitely worth watching, but could have been much better.",7,2,4,28 December 2007
Halloween," the original, and still the best.....
","Before Freddy, before Jason, before Hollywood ran out of ideas and made poorly conceived remakes of horror classics, there was Michael. This movie, produced on a shoestring by master filmmaker John Carpenter, really was the beginning of the true 'slasher' film genre, and was the birth of the horror 'series' films (you can decide for yourself whether that part was good or bad). Take the suspense of a Hitchcock film, and merge it with the most evil character imaginable, and you've got this film. Great music (simplicity was the key), awesome camera shots and angles, and tons of great scares make this a classic that never gets old. I still watch this movie every time I see it on television, because its just that good. This is how horror films should be made. Unfortunately the sequels to this were nowhere near as good, but this film is the best of the best when it comes to horror films.........",10,0,3,27 January 2010
Click," This was a horrible film
","What was this movie? A comedy? A drama? A fantasy film gone awry? I watched it and still don't know. This movie was both clich√© and silly at the same time, and never really went anywhere. The entire concept of the film was as outlandish as the worst children's cartoon, with a sprinkling of terrible outrageous tragedy. At the end of the film the writers then attempted to bring it all to a happy end with an ending reminiscent of 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Just silly, boring, dreadful, etc, etc. I've never felt so cheated out of 2 hours of my life before watching this film. I love Adam Sandler and have enjoyed several of his films (Wedding Singer, Water Boy, Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, etc.) , but he should stick to real comedies where he belongs. He is not believable or very talented in the area of serious acting (if that's even what he was attempting to do here). Save your time and money, and 'click' this one off.......",1,2,7,15 March 2007
