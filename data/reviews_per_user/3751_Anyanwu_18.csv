The Ring," Please get ahold of the original.
","There are not many cases in anything that where a copy/remake is as good as the original. The main reason I think is that the original gives you an experience that you never had before. That is why I would be tainted haven seen the original Ring. Ebay rules! (Don't get me started on Battle Royale.) The thrill is gone, somewhat.  I will say this about this American version. I was suprised that it stayed with the slow buildup of the original movie. It did not try to get really exciting until it was necessary. I think it is hard to get an audience to stay with a film when it has such a buildup, especially post slasher quick fright films, like Halloween,Friday 13th, Nightmare.. Scream etc. The 10's are reserved for the Rosemary's Babys, Exorcist and the like. This movie is not in that category. But there are 2 aspects that are. 1. Rick Baker is a bitch. The little that you saw of his work in this movie substantiates his title as best in horror make up. 2. The music by Hans Zimmer was mesmorizing. It was in the same league as Tubular Bells of the Exorcist.  It was so good, I stayed, as I usually do anyway until the end of the credits, just to hear the music; I mean that was just f**king scary. I will be buying the soundtrack",7,0,0,8 November 2002
Minority Report," I'm sure I'm in the Minority.
","This movie was okay. The tech stuff at the start of the movie was really interesting but it fell back into the same stuff we've seen before. After the gadgets the story was the same as before. One of the main problems was that the issue was only a personal one not one that had any greater social significance. A simple example is that Anderton did not, to any great degree that I could tell, question the fact that what had happened to him could be happening and could have happened to others. The process of law that he was so gung ho to be leader of turned around and bit him in the ass. He never questions(looks inside of himself)the ramifications of this problem. Anyone involved in such a sweeping law of justice would have to question what he has been doing. Examples of movies that reach outside of just the individual are Matrix, Fight Club, Blade Runner. These films find the connection from the personal to the community. They also show characters questioning the 'idea' of their problem. Example, in Blade Runner, Harrison Ford's character ends up questioning the definition of what it is to be human. Film's like Minority Report are great when your young(audience and filmmaker) but the really great movies capture all ages with a deeper meaning; ie Matrix, Blade Runner.",6,0,0,29 June 2002
Detroit," High mark for exposure.
","SPOILER ALERT: Saw the film opening weekend. Had to, I'm from Detroit. Gave it an 8 on IMDb just for exposing the story to the general public. The actor that portrayed Officer David Senak, the main racist officer, may get an academy nomination. My understanding is that he was played close to the real man. He shot 5/6 people during the riot. My understanding is that the guard, Dismukes, played by Boyega actually brutalized some of the teens. He is portrayed as a hero but was the opposite. Those who testified specified that HE tortured THEM, so there is not mistake about that. It was he that was a consultant to the film therefore him coming out as he did, as a hero trying to help, makes sense. The main issue was there was no context of how this came to be. The revolt came as a result of...? No context of the buildup and no context of what happened after regarding the Algiers. There were people's trials, as I understand, at the Shrine of the Black Madonna, where people where packed in to address the situation. So the revolt just shows the audience people stealing etc etc. So no context of the rebellion, the security guard took part in the beatings and did not testify at all. That being said, having been around the film industry, I'm guessing this played out one of two ways. Filmmaker is a women. She wants to make this film about 1967 Detroit. Studios will not give her money to do a complete story as it was, Oscar or not. She's still a female filmmaker. So you do this movie. OR she just wanted to tie in current events with this film and only focus on how things have not changed. Showing... the audience what you see now is no different than what it always has been. DETROIT is how it has been. In cold blood. The Detroit police, was, 'the gestapo' and that's what they did. They killed. Bigelow just wanted to focus on the complete racist, and evilness of the Detroit Police specifically Officer Senak and how what he did at the Algiers, killing those teens, is not any different than the police brutality now.",8,1,7,21 August 2017
The Babadook," Well done but really not scary.
","It's been awhile since I've posted a review so I hope this helps. I did not come away from this film feeling haunted. A strong, mind that I did not say great, film leaves me with a feeling of dread even after the film. It really has to make me feel uneasy while watching and keeps my eyes glued to the screen. Lucky McGee's The Woman did that. The Babadook did not. It was well done in the sense that it sets the mood for bad things to happen but it did not push through all the way toward terror and dread. Jennifer Kent did a great job in her first film both in writing and direction. I would say Andres Muschietti's Mama had a stronger feel for horror. I'm not a fan of the stereotypical woman who is generally weak in the face of major horrific issues whether they be internal or external. And this may be My problem. One, a soft female protagonist and Two, the origin of the evil force. I went on the statement put out by William Friedkin that this was a great horror film. Friedkin's endorsement was the impetus since I rank The Exorcist as the greatest horror film of all time. Alien is next. Both have smart, strong female characters that face an evil that is external to their understanding of reality. So The Babadook scores low for me there. My criticism is probably more a result of my preference than what the film really delivers to a general audience. I cannot see why anyone would give it one or two stars. I think you have to have a bad looking film for that. But, I thought the mood that Kent sets was great it just didn't send me over into that dreaded feeling. And I surely didn't think about it once the film was over.",5,8,22,11 December 2014
The Others," Not a 10 but worth seeing
","Tesis director does a good job w/his 1st foray into an American production. He writes, directs and did the score.  Great dynamics in tension/thriller. There is not much horror involved, but this is a good ghost story.  Not as good as Tesis. Those who have seen Tesis will notice the how he, in one scene, bites his own film.  In the realm of Sixth Sense, but a few notches down.",5,0,0,10 August 2001
Cloverfield," Monsters Return, Yes!
","Let's start out with this. This is an 8 out of 10 film. And yes, I will see it again. It's really great to see the standard monster come back to horror. Outside of The Host we have missed the creation of a really good monster movie and this is it. Like The Host, somewhat, the concentration of the film is from ordinary people, who are a few in millions being attacked. It does not take the stance of 'the authorities' and follow where the monster came from and how it can be killed. See Godzilla. But the key to the film is the camera. As has been talked about much about Cloverfield, the Blair Witch perspective does much to lend a sense of claustrophobia and hence extreme tenseness to watch the film. Blair Witch & Cloverfield really concentrate your attention to the fact that you do not have peripheral vision. The camera acts as your eyes. Your normal eye sight allows you to have peripheral vision. Now the camera, in Blair Witch & Cloverfield, having replaced your eyes allows you to see like your real eyes but with the peripheral sight taken away. Your overall vision reduced, makes you very tense and uncertain of even what's right next to you. That's what you feel in Cloverfield. Get some horse blinders and walk around for a day and see how uncertain you feel. That's the visceral response that you get. The camera is greatly used also in the reveal of the monster. You never really get a good look, much like the first Alien film. That also heightens the tension. The dialogue is just enough to keep the pace going. Without the dialogue, the urgency in the voice, the pace of the film would be slower. Just the action alone would make it more difficult to maintain the frantic pace needed. Of course my only knocks on the film are the traditional. Women crying and emotional. Do all women cry and get emotional in the face of danger? Naw. See 28 Days. The sappy parts do slow down the film even if it's just a little bit. Looking into your lover's eyes can wait. Death is near and it could be a painful, ugly one. Get out! Why don't people run like hell when they can obviously see that what is coming is bigger and badder than they could ever comprehend? People run!! This is something terrible. Go See Cloverfield!",8,1,8,19 January 2008
Silent Hill," Looked pretty, but it...STINKS!
","Wow. Just like 'Resident Evil'. I wanted this movie to be good, and I was bored. The best scenes were too short and the best character (with a six foot knife...yikes!) wasn't used to his full potential. Sigh.VG fans will groan and moan about how great this was, how 'it was so much like the video game!' But we are in the movie world. We don't need convoluted back story and zombie-like little girls running back and forth doing nothing. Sigh.I'm not too happy about the comments being made about 'An American Haunting' either. I really think Americans have lost the nerve to create good visuals with a good STORY. Sigh.And I really, really needed a good scary movie this month!",1,1,6,28 April 2006
Léon: The Professional," This uncut version of what is release as the Professional is even more endearing.
","What was the Professional in the States is even better in this uncut version of that film.  What you get is the added relationship scenes that are obviously cut out in the Professional.  You can see the interaction between the two main characters and it adds a greater warmth to the film. The edited version of the Stateside release shows us our squeamish we are when it comes to such male/man female/child relationships.  The film was well done in that regard and does not overstep the boundaries I guess that the censors were worried about. When it comes to this stuff, along with film length, We Suck.",9,0,1,10 May 2000
Split," Pretty Standard stuff for the most part.
","I'm in most of the courts of the people that said this is bad. This was pretty much middle of the road when it comes to this kind of thriller or 'horror'. Cool idea regarding the disorder stuff. But, this runs with the movies like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER et al. The way the characters react to surviving and stuff like that. We are much smarter than that and the same old tropes that we see in characters are just annoying. Even down to young girls running around with no bras. So old. We can give it a couple of pts for the last seen just on principle. But as a film I am not in the court that says M. Night is back. But I don't give it a 1 cause the script although with some non plausible concepts was still there.",4,11,25,1 May 2017
The Hills Have Eyes," This movie was not good
","****Spoilers.**** Watch the original. Filmmakers sold out in this one. No one should survive. Dumb characters. Everybody runs out when dad catches fire. Mothers, are you really going to run out without your baby? Dumb. No one is aware of daughter when she doesn't come out when dad is on fire? Dumb. Son doesn't let everyone know that dog #1 has been filleted. Dumb. Practically everyone in film is lame. Ex-detective dad starts shooting without seeing who he is shooting at. Dumb. Son goes off half cocked and shoots into the dark. Son gets all McGiver after most of family is destroyed. Son goes to look for his mother, when taken, finds her and monster who has taken her and is now eating her, then starts running away. Dude, isn't that what you came looking for? Son in Law doesn't kill person who took his baby therefore she gets to come back and whack him in the head. Dumb. This was made for 9 year olds. Can we have a film where little pretty girls don't start becoming hysterical? Dumb. And these guys were great with Haute Tension. This one is bad. I gave it a 2. I rarely give films such a low rating, when I do it's because I was thoroughly disgusted. It wasn't smart, It wasn't scary and the kills weren't all that great.",7,0,1,18 March 2007
No Country for Old Men," Disappointing and over-hyped.
","I enjoyed 'Fargo' which I feel is their best work, but 'No Country' was boring. The acting was fine, but the story just didn't inspire me. Usually a really good movie makes me want to go out a write ( I am a screenwriter myself). It gives me hope that there are some good stories out there being made into film. But this one...I dunno, it was like someone put a lump of cookie dough onto a baking sheet, and the cookie didn't bake. So you're left with a lump of..cookie dough. I got up in the middle of the movie to buy popcorn and a soda, used the restroom just to entertain myself. I NEVER do that at a good movie. I stay planted and aware. But I had to get away from it for a few minutes. Thank God we didn't pay a lot to see it.I'm not going to go all out intellectual on this puppy, because frankly, I don't have th energy to nitpick every detail, so I'll skim over a few things that bugged me. I've read some of the other postings by fans of the movie. It seems that the few folks who dislike the film are accused of not 'understanding' the greatness of the Coen brothers themes on violence in America..blah,blah,blah. I love movies, seen a lot (foreign and American made) so the reality is, this movie didn't work FOR ME. It bored me, left me uninspired and I regret that I didn't wait until DVD. Potential 'spoiler area' ahead. You were warned.1. They did try something interesting, which is kill off a lead character by the third act. But Tommy Lee Jones's character was not that interesting to sustain the last section of the film. As a writer, I applaud the bait and switch technique of taking out a character that we've followed from the beginning. However, having Tommy's monologue at the beginning, and showing him later in the film does not help sustain his presence once his character takes over in the third act. Plus, his being an old gunslinger weary from the battle is old. I kept wondering if the dynamic would've shifted dramatically had this been a younger sheriff. Every time Tommy Lee came on screen, I just got tired because who looked so drained. I understand this was probably an attempt to be the 'message' of the film, (How do old folks deal with changes they can't fathom?), but I've seen that too many times.2.'Quirky' dialogue by the killer and potential victims was not enough to pull this clunker together. As stand alone vignettes at a short film festival, it would've been entertaining. But to string them throughout two hours kills me, and smacks of pretentious dribble. Perhaps if they had opened up the film with that scene in the gas station, prior to us knowing who Bardem's character is, it would've set a tone of unease, given us the rules of the killer's world.Prepared us with the sense of dread whenever he appears then cut to his short capture, and then onto the idiot Moss and his discovery. For this project, I didn't buy it. It smells like a writing technique/device to razzle dazzle us so we don't notice that nothing is really happening.3. Stupid people do stupid things and kill any chance of me rooting for them. Moss was plain stupid. Although this is set in 1980, don't make the person who we follow in the story stupid. You find money. You take it. You do NOT go back in the middle of the night to bring a man water, A man who you left in the hot desert sun all day. If your conscience bothers you that much, make a call to the police, and you leave town with your wife outside of Texas. What a bonehead. Once you've made the decision to steal the goods, you check the goods and make sure you can't be traced. (the fact that Moss said ' I know what a transmittor is' but doesn't check for one, or even dye pellets inside the money, dude you are a screw up and deserve your fate).4. It just sucked for me. I can't even put my finger on why this flick sucked for me. The cinematography was okay but not that impressive to make up for the story. The acting was okay, but no one in it made me jump up and proclaim 'Dagnabit! That boy deserves an Oscar!'. The best I could say is that this honestly could've been a made-for-TV movie. The violence was minimal. The cattle prod-gun was cool the first time you see it, but then I started thinking 'You're lugging that thing around, and no one notices? You pull a man over in a cop car, but you have no uniform and you have a cattle prod air tank with you, and the yahoos in town just look at you?' More than anything, this movie made Texans look like dumb hicks. (maybe this explains Bush's background) So those are my main reasons for disliking the film. I've heard loving reviews of the theme of the hunter and the hunted, a killer with no conscience and the sheriff with morality leaking out of his a$$. It's all lies I tell you! It is hyped 'blah', just like 'The Departed' was last year. Any talk of Oscar Buzz is undeserved in my opinion. In it's place I would recommend 'Eastern Promises'.",9,36,61,1 January 2008
Hero," Beautiful and complex.
","This film is visually beautiful and its story complex.  The visually stunning aspect is something that one can only describe in words and those who have no sight would need a great wordsmith to give true weight to the beauty of HERO.  This, no doubt, will be the focus of countless critiques of HERO.  But what enhances the visual beauty is the complex nature of the story.  The taboo of American screenwriting, flashbacks within flashbacks are used liberally.  The idea of the unreliable narrator takes you on an 'thinking' trip.  As the stories weave in and out of each other and different scenarios are presented to you, your mind is working while at the same time you are inundated with the visual 'look' of what is on screen.  I will close my critique in linking this Chinese film to the great Japanese filmmaker Kurosawa,  With that said anyone who reads this will, if they have an inkling of the greatness of Kurosawa, rush to see this epic of honor, nobility and passion. All should heed the words of another IMDB critic blakndn on a critique of this film.",10,0,0,29 August 2004
Slap Shot," Pure Comedy from start to finish
","C'mon, this is pure comedy. No breaks, no lull parts just funny all the way through with the appropriate cheesy 70's soundtrack. This movie not being in AFI's top 100 comedy films is a travesty.  If they want a period piece this was it. They sighted Fast Times, it just stands to reason that Slap Shot should fall into the listing.  The Hanson's deserve special consideration. The casting is perfect",10,58,72,13 June 2000
The Descent," Great Scary Movie
","Rented this movie from eddie brandts in L.A. back in March on VHS no less on recommendation of the clerk, 'bless her soul'. I was a big fan of Dog Soldiers so when I heard that this was the director's next effort I was all over it. This is what a scary movie is all about. Depending on what is shown in US theaters you probably will be getting the shaft. I am going to see it again to see what changes were made to satisfy US audience. This movie gives credence that the best horror/scary films come from abroad and when they do they have to be altered decreasing the value of the film. (see Haute Tension). If you are a fan of the scary movie do yourself the favor and go see the Descent. It's many times greater than the Cave.",9,2,6,22 July 2006
Joker," Joker: Masterfully portrayed by Phoenix
","The first and most important issue is that Joaquin Phoenix played the hell out of the role of Joker. His physicality is what struck me most. The way he moved, the little idiosyncrasies. He was all in to the character. The filmmakers really took the time to think through all of Joker's motivation. All of the issues that created him both internally and externally. I was really surprised that social issues were such a strong back drop for Joker's development. Joker will cause conflict with the viewer cause he is a very sympathetic character. The audience wants to support the Joker. The great conflict now comes will that support, as twisted as it is, and some justified really trump the reason, rise and support for the creation of Batman. Right now it seems that support is more for the Joker seeing all that he has gone through. He represents all the poor, abused, the uncared for, forgotten and downtrodden of our society. The invisible people we don't see everyday. Bruce Wayne comes from a place of security and support. Is his tragedy more important, more horrific than the Joker?",8,1,2,17 November 2019
Godzilla," We want Godzilla, not sappy emotional reunions
","I'm going to give this a 5 because it's Godzilla. He is the greatest monster in movies of all time. I love how he states this in the movie. It' a like he does a most muscular pose in making his point. The main problem, and there were many, was that there just wasn't enough of him. We don't want to see sappy family reunions, we want to see the baddest monster of all time. He is the god of monsters and it's him we want to see. Ken Watanabe stands around the whole movie looking stunned and amazed. He was never proactive yet he has the most info on the monsters of anyone in the film. And the whole thing about the military firing guns. It's like they have no idea what they're up against, as if guns will help. That's just a leap of logic in 2014. If you know a weapon has no use, the military in that context is impotent, so more intelligent and creative methods should have been shown to initiate military operations.The whole family sappy film stuff is just too much. When did I feel the most emotion, not when the family got reunited I'll tell you that. I teared up a little at the other moment. If you like Godzilla you'll know when. The movie was 30 minutes too long.",5,1,2,3 June 2014
The Island," Much better than what everyone was saying
","I don't know why this was so bad mouthed. Chase seen was what the chase seen in the Matrix should have been. Great music and sound design was superior. Often times action sequences are fortified by metal music. In this case the sound was great. For sci-fi it looked great. Not far out crazy but a realistic future. This is a great movie. For the most part each scene moved the story along. I am not a fan of Michael Bay fan at all, but this was solid film.This movie got shafted by the bad press. Unfortunately I did not get to see this on the big screen. If you get a chance see it their. The effects will obviously take greater hold add that with the sound the experience has to great. Go see it.",8,1,1,14 February 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Simply a great movie, story and soundtrack
","The Coen Brothers have to be considered one of the top filmmakers of our time. They've taken an age old story, crafted a creative screenplay around it and tacked on also creative soundtrack, courtesy of T. Bone Burnett, who should be nominated for a special consideration for the music. The Oscars should consider a special category for music that might have been performed prior to the making of the film but takes on a different life and meaning when used in the filmmaking process. Excellent film.",8,0,0,16 September 2001
