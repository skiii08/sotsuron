Iron Man 3," Not a fan
","The third installment in the 'Iron' Man film franchise has been hyped up for quite some time now. Though it has gained a lot of positive reviews, I have to say I was a tad bit disappointed. As per usual it stars Robert Downey Jr as billionaire Tony Stark, also known as 'Iron Man' and Gwyneth Paltrow as 'Pepper Potts'. Ben Kingsley plays a terrorist known as the 'Mandarin' who is executing various terror attacks that not only threaten the safety of U.S inhabitants, but the safety of 'Iron Man' himself. As the story progresses we find out that the Mandarin's co co conspirator is a scientist named 'Aldrich Killian' (Guy Pearce) who stark had humiliated years ago. Needless to say, one liners and explosions ensueI have never been a fan of the 'Marvel Comics' movies. I have always found them rather annoying and somewhat obnoxious. Although, I did enjoy the first 'Iron Man' film i was not a big fan of 'The Avengers', nor 'Iron Man 2'. The main problem with this film is the story. I am going to reveal some major plot points, so if you don't want spoilers do not continue reading this review. The entire plot twist involving the Mandarin being an actor hired by Aldrich Killian was completely ludicrous. It felt incredibly lazy and damaged the story to great extents. I understand that superhero films tend to be over the top, but 'Iron Man 3' goes to such extents of absurdity that it goes from being regular popcorn action to being completely unbearable. The best part of the film is probably Robert Downey Jr. He manages to still remain charismatic and likable.Though, I was expecting more out of this film, I did find it enjoyable to some extent. Robert Downey Jr, Guy Pearce, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Kingsley were fine on a performance level, but the sloppy storytelling and silly plot twists ruined the movie for me. Iron Man 3 is a fun movie, but in my opinion a disappointing one.",5,1,3,18 July 2013
This Is the End," The end is nigh!
","Seth Rogen's directorial debut 'This Is The End' is the newest hit comedy to tear up the 'Box Office'. Surprisingly, it has not only gained the acclaim of cinema audiences, but of film critics as well, earning a stable 83% on 'Rotten Tomatoes'. James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson and Seth Rogen among many other well known celebrities play themselves. Or rather over the top versions of themselves. It follows a fairly simple plot, Jay Baruchel arrives at Los Angeles to spend some time with his old, somewhat estranged friend Seth Rogen. They immediately head to Seth's house where they smoke weed and binge eat. Later on Seth tells Jay that he is invited to James Franco's housewarming party and that he would like Jay to accompany him. Despite being wary of going, Jay finally accepts Seth's offer and they head out for the night. Upon arriving at Franco's house they are greeted by James himself. In the film Franco is portrayed as an art loving pseudo-intellectual in contrast to Rogen who is presented as a stereotypical pothead, the kind he plays so often. We soon see Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson. Hill is portrayed as ultra nice and Robinson as a sex obsessed smooth talker. Among the party guests there are stars like Michael Cera, Emma Watson and even Rihanna, who luckily is killed off soon enough. Jay and Seth decide to go to a local kiosk to get cigarettes. Just as they approach the shop's counter blue lights shoot through the roof and lift several store customers up to the sky. They both panic and attempt to flee back to the party. The streets are filled with chaos, from explosions to vehicle crashes. They manage to get back to the party, but a massive earthquake will soon shatter their relief and begin none other than the apocalypse.This is quite frankly a genuinely funny film. Yes, it does sometimes buy into cheap slapstick gags, but it is entertaining at all times and even has some golden moments. Jonah Hill's performance was by far my favorite part of this film. He has proved that he can be great in dramatic and comedic roles, or even a both at the same time. He proved this with 2011′s baseball drama 'Moneyball', even with his early films like 'Superbad' and I have no doubt that he'll prove it again with Martin Scorsese's upcoming crime drama 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. I love the fact that these actors aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves and doing so provide some great, subtle humor. One of my favorite moments in the film is a certain reference, to a certain film where someone is impregnated by the devil (Rosemary's Baby). The reference was extremely obvious, but to me it was incredibly funny mostly because 'Rosemary's Baby' is one of my favorite films.It feels a bit childish at times, but ultimately 'This Is The End' is a fresh, new comedy that will most certainly make you laugh at least once. It has a fair share of loud , blaring humor, but it also has some moments of subtlety that if noticed will definitely enrich the comedic experience. I immensely enjoyed it and would love to see it again in some time.",7,2,6,16 July 2013
World War Z," Brad Pitt saves the world...
","Based on the novel by Max Brooks, the action thriller 'World War Z' is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. It is directed by Marc Forster, a director who has gained a lot of critical acclaim from such films as the 2005 'Best Picture' nominee 'Finding Neverland' as well as the thriller from 2001 'Monster's Ball' which earned Halle Berry an academy award. The story revolves around former UN investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) who has left his job in order to spend more time with his two daughters and wife Karin (Mireille Enos). His life seems peaceful, he and his family live in a cozy house in the suburbs of Philadelphia. This peace is about to be shattered as international tensions are rising due to a mysterious plague that turns those infected into feral creatures. One day, when Gerry and his family are stuck in traffic in the middle of the city the infected begin attacking the inhabitants as well as causing mass destruction. The Lane's manage to escape within the inch of their lives and hide out with a family in an apartment building. Nevertheless, the infected are not far behind and the Lanes are forced to escape again. They run up the stairs of the apartment building until they reach the roof where they miraculously are picked up by an army helicopter and taken to a safe aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean. The carrier is property of the United Nations and if Gerry wants his family to stay on the carrier he will have to follow their orders. Gerry is forced to return to his old job and is sent off with a task force to find the cure for the plague.Whilst the film's premise is undoubtedly interesting, it is not executed very well. 'World War Z' starts off with a bang and creates some great claustrophobic tension. Unfortunately the rest of the film tends to feel dull. The cast give exceptional performances and Brad Pitt once again proves that he is an excellent lead actor. Bear in mind that this is most definitely not a bad film, it's justOK. Like I said, the film looks promising in the first few scenes, but then becomes dull. It should be noted that one of the films major strong point is the impressive visuals and intense camera-work. One of the main problems that hinder the film is that there is very little character development when it comes to Brad Pitt's character. We don't know anything about his past and we don't know the reasoning behind his actions. 'World War Z' is most definitely a movie that should be seen in the cinema with a friend, it provides some intense action, but other than that it hasn't got much to offer. I had also heard that the movie was re-shot after the director decided that the story was too politically driven. This really annoyed me because there could have been some great potential for this film if it was more than just popcorn actionThis is without a doubt a fun movie, but it becomes progressively predictable and dull. What could have been a fascinating social commentary is now a piece of popcorn entertainment. If you're looking for a movie to see with your friends, sure go see it, but if you're looking for something profound or in any way deep, avoid it.",5,0,1,16 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Fulfilling..
","'Star Trek: Into Darkness' is the highly anticipated sequel J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot of the 'Star Trek' franchise. After the events of 'Star Trek' the crew of the USS 'Enterprise' have returned to their regular routine. They are sent to a distant planet to observe an alien race. Their mission goes terribly wrong as a natural disaster threatens the lives of the planet's indigenous civilization. In efforts to protect the planet, the ship's first officer Spock tries to control the situation, but his life is soon in grave danger. Captain James T. Kirk is forced to disobey the 'Prime Directive' to safe Spock's life and exposes the enterprise to the planet's civilization. Upon returning to the starfleet's headquarters, Kirk is stripped of his position as ship captain, but is appointed as the first officer to admiral Montgomery Pike, who takes Kirk's place as commanding officer of the 'Enterprise'. Parallel to this, an unknown terrorist is plotting an attack that not only threatens the safety of the starfleet, but the entire 'Galactic Federation'Despite director J.J. Abrams overly stylistic direction, I immensely enjoyed 'Star Trek: Into Darkness'. The awe-inspiring action sequences gave me chills and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance was excellent. His voice literally made his character so great. When I went out of the theater, I wasn't sure if I liked the film, but now after some consideration I have come to the conclusion that I loved it. Even though it is action packed, it still provides a great story and plenty of substance to keep the viewer engrossed all the way through the film (though it dragged on a bit close to the end). Often times big budget action films have mediocre acting, again this is not the case with this film. The entire cast provides good performances, but Benedict Cumberbatch stole the show.I don't have a whole lot to say about this film other than it had great special effects, great action, great pacing and great characters. The only downside was that towards the end the film dragged on a bit. Other than that, 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' is another win on the behalf of director, J.J. Abrams.",8,3,6,16 July 2013
Man of Steel," The question on everyone's mind is....
","Zack Snyder's long awaited reboot of the 'Superman' franchise has finally hit the big screen and already grossed over a hundred million dollars in the United States. I was lucky enough to get a ticket to an early screening of the film and thankfully did not have to wait another week to see it. The film stars Henry Cavill as the man of steel, Kal-El, also known as 'Superman'. In the case of this film we have an all star cast, the supporting cast is built up by such actors as Amy Adams, Micheal Shannon, Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner so there is plenty of talent involved here. 'Man of Steel' is basically the origin story of 'Superman'. In the first scenes of the film we see the planet of Krypton a somewhat desolate, but seemingly advanced planet that is soon to be completely destroyed due to the planet's unstable core. The Kryptonian high council is helpless and faces the threat of being overthrown by the planet's chief of military, General Zod, played by Michael Shannon. Zod has staged a coup and plans to restore the Kryptonian race on new land. Meanwhile, the wife of scientist Jor-El (Russel Crowe), Lara- El gives birth to the first natural born child of Krypton for centuries. They both realize that Krypton faces complete annihilation and decide to launch their new born son into space en- route for Earth. Before launching him, Jor-El steals the 'genetic codex' and merges it's cells with those of the Kal-El to keep the Kryptonian race intact. General Zod soon finds out and storms into their home with his followers, but it is too late as the shuttle begins to launch. Zod murders Jor-El and is arrested, then he is sent to the 'Phantom Zone' together with his followers. It is not long until Krypton meets it's imminent end and explodes. The explosion let's Zod and his followers out of the 'Phantom Zone'. Their goal now is to find Kal-El and bring him back to his homeland using brute force if necessary.This is a film that should be seen in a cinema, the stylish camera-work and outstanding special effects can only be truly experienced on the big screen. As with many modern re-imaginings of super hero stories, 'Man of Steel' seems to be going for a darker, more mature tone. We've seen this before in Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy which worked very well. In the case of 'Man of Steel' it works nearly just as well. The only issue is that the bleak tone sometimes feels overbearing and like Zack Snyder is trying too hard to make 'Superman' be as serious as can be. The performances are solid, but the standout must be Micheal Shannon who did a great job with his character. Whenever he was on screen, I got chills. The films major downside is that it tends to become generic and predictable. You can just tell that whenever someone is in danger, 'Superman' will swoop in at the last minute to save the day. Yes, it's a staple for 'Superman', but it becomes so predictable. Speaking of predictable, the action sequences are so repetitive that it hurts. It becomes a certainty that someone is going to get thrown through buildings or fly down close to the ground. I will say that the score by Hans Zimmer is astounding.All problems aside, 'Man of Steel' is a faithful adaptation to the classic 'Superman' comics as well as being it's own film. It gives the 'Superman' franchise a darker tone. Packed with great performances, beautiful special effects and a chilling score by Hans Zimmer, Zack Snyder's 'Man of Steel' is a well thought out, energetic and much needed reboot to the 'Superman' film series.",7,0,0,16 July 2013
Now You See Me," A testament to mediocrity.
","'Now You See Me' is the newest film from french director Louis Leterrier, the man behind the 'Incredible Hulk', the two 'Transporter' films as well as the ever so disappointing 'Clash of the Titans'. 'Now You See Me' tells the story of a group of magicians that call themselves 'The Four Horsemen'. The group consists of (big surprise) four people: 'Daniel Atlas' (Jesse Eisenberg), 'Henley Reeves'(Isla Fisher), 'Jack Wilder'(Dave Franco) and 'Merritt McKinney'(Woody Harrelson). They all possess very colorful and somewhat obnoxious personalities. Before banding together to form their group all of them were either street performers or rogue magicians. After each of them receive a mysterious card that leads them to a dingy apartment where they are given access to blueprints depicting amazing magic tricks they establish 'The Four Horsemen'. We then fast forward a year later, they have all become accomplished magicians and are pulling off mind bending performances together. During their show in Las Vegas they claim that for their final trick, they will rob a bank. They pick an audience member 'randomly' and supposedly teleport them to a large bank in Paris. Inexplicably, they manage to steal the money. Soon enough FBI detective 'Dylan Rodes' is teamed up with a young 'Interpol' agent named 'Alma Dray'(Melanie Laurent) and are assigned to capture 'The Four Horsemen', but they just keep slipping through his fingers.Whilst undoubtedly being fun and entertaining, the story of 'Now You See Me' is so over the top and ludicrous that at times it feels a bit insulting to someones intelligence. The magicians pull off stunts that could only be described as 'paranormal' and since this movie is supposed to be grounded in reality, it seems rather silly. The acting is..alright despite being overly comical that comes off as being pretty obnoxious and annoying. The visual effects aren't great, but they're not bad either. The problem with them is that it is extremely obvious that everything is computer generated. The best part of the film has to be Morgan Freeman. He can always make a film feel entertaining and always brings life to the screen. The greatest damage to the film has to be the utterly stupid plot twists. Although everything seems to add up and come together, the plot twists feel childish and unnecessary.The film is entertaining, but chances are that you will forget it in a few days. The characters are shallow, the plot is ludicrous and the twists are childish. The best that 'Now You See Me' provide is some good popcorn entertainment that you can watch with your friends. This film continues Louis Leterrier's streak of mediocrity.",5,4,7,16 July 2013
Behind The Candelabra," A joy to watch!
","Steven Soderbergh's biographical drama about the late, great pianist and entertainer, Walter Liberace premiered at the Cannes Film Festival about a week ago and has received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Actually, this is not a biography of Liberace at all. It is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson. It tells the story of his obsessive sexual relationship with Liberace. Matt Damon plays Thorson in the leading role of the film and Academy Award winner Micheal Douglas plays Liberace. The film opens with Scott sitting in a club, a man approaches him and begins to flirt with him. It becomes obvious that he is gay. By day, Scott works on film sets with animals used for stunts and hopes to become a veterinarian. One day he is invited to accompany a film producer to one of Liberace's shows. After the show, Scott is invited backstage to meet the man himself. They get along well and soon enough he is invited to Liberace's house. Liberace takes a liking for him and invites Scott to work for him. They soon develop a bond that becomes a serious sexual relationship.I will start off by saying if you decide to watch this movie be ready for some uncomfortable moments. That aside I have to say that I thought this film was excellent. Micheal Douglas delivered a fantastic performance and I would not be surprised if he will be nominated for an 'Oscar' next year. Damon also did a great job at portraying a naive, young and troubled man. The film itself was just fascinating. Soderbergh perfectly balanced comedy and drama as well as doing a great job at creating the overall tone and style of the film without coming off as overly stylish. It's really a shame that he has said that this is to be his last feature film.This is a daring, engrossing and incredibly well made film. Though some scenes may seem gratuitous and the style may be too flashy for some, Matt Damon and Micheal Douglas deliver stellar performances that boasted the film to even greater heights. 'Behind the Candelabra' is one of my favorite films of 2013 so far, I highly recommend it.",8,0,4,16 July 2013
Evil Dead," Fine...I guess
","The new hit horror film 'Evil Dead' is a re-imagining of Sam Raimi's horror classic of the same name. You've probably heard this kind of plot before as it has been re-done over and over again. A group of teenagers head out to an old, dreary cabin in the middle of the woods to get away from the commotion of the city and help their friend overcome drug addiction. Upon arriving in the cabin, they notice a foul smell coming from the cellar. As they investigate, they find tons of animal corpses hanging from the ceiling, as well as a mysterious book full of strange writings and illustrations of satanic creatures. One of the teenagers begins to read the book despite the warnings written on the pages. He unleashes an evil force that is capable of unimaginable cruelty.Bear in mind that this is an 'Evil Dead' film, so it is pretty obvious logical thinking is thrown out of the door. I can't really say i thought this film was awful, but I really don't think it is very good. The acting is just like the rest of the film, not really bad and not really good. The film's major strong point is the outstanding special effects and the beautifully filmed shots, the visual style is beautifully haunting. It transmits the dreary tone of the film to the viewer as well as provides eye-catching visuals. Another major strength to the films is that the director, Fede Alvarez stays very faithful to the source material of the original 'Evil Dead'. He almost always uses practical effects for the gory scenes of the film as well as for the scenery. There is little to no CGI in this film, which is astounding. This made the film feel extremely brutal and at times hard to watch. The major problem with 'Evil Dead' is that there is no character development for most of the characters, the two main characters have some character development, but the other three seem to be in the film just to be killed off later. It is also frustrating to watch the characters making completely ludicrous decisions, this is a regular problem is modern horror movies that continues to annoy the hell out of me.This is a film that can be a lot of fun, but when you look at it from a logical perspective, it becomes really annoying. It's major strengths are the special effects and how faithful it is to the original. Although it is an enjoyable movie, it is full of plot holes and annoyances. I would recommend it if you are looking to have a entertaining movie experience, other than that, I can't really recommend it.",6,6,22,18 July 2013
Elysium," It's no 'District 9', but...
","'District 9″ was one of the most ambitious and dare I say most creative films in recent memory. The film's director, Neil Blomkamp showcased his directorial talent not only with the stylistic aspects of the film, but with the overall pacing and story. With that in mind, I would be lying if I were to say that the film did not have it's fair share of problems. 'District 9″ was laced with inconsistencies and plot holes, but it's gripping story and meticulous attention to the production design forced me to ignore these nitpicks. Blomkamp's newest film 'Elysium' is yet another sci-fi thriller. It stars Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley and is set in the distant-ish future. Basically, earth has become a poverty stricken, overpopulated wasteland due to mass amounts of pollution. The upper echelon of society has built a large space station in which the wealthy population can live. The space station is known as 'Elysium', any virus disease or injury can be cured there with the help of the station's state of the art medical technology. Elysium's tight security is helmed by Secretary Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster who has a crazed thirst for power. The story mainly revolves around the character of Max, played by Matt Damon. Max is an engineer working at a large factory, building droids. After serving his time in prison for various crimes, Max has decided to turn his life around. Unfortunately, after a fatal accident at the factory, Max is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and has only got five days left to live. His only hope is to get to Elysium and cure his disease. To infiltrate the stations wide array of security, Max is forced to risk his own life.This is a pretty over the top film, especially Jodie Foster's performance. Foster plays the cliché sophisticated villain that is always bearing a snobbish grin. She speaks in a very strange accent that is sort of a mix between British and..middle eastern or south African and to top it off, she exaggerates all of her lines to the point of laughter. Not a good performance on the part of Foster. Matt Damon gives an alright performance, I would have liked for his character to have more depth and development. Otherwise, he was alright. On an entertainment level, Sharlto Copley shines bright, his character, although over the top provides for some great entertainment. He is both psychotic and likable. The production design is just wow, it is beautiful. Neil Blomkamp seems to love to indulge in the look of his films. In the case of 'Elysium' we see two different worlds, both equally impressive. We see the sleek and sterile Elysium and the ruined, dingy Earth. It is fair to say that the stylistic aspects of the film are a win on behalf of Neil Blomkamp. Like 'District 9″, 'Elysium' has a fair amount of political and social commentaries. This time regarding healthcare and immigration. I'm not going to go into great depths in regard to the film's underlying themes, because i'm just not up for it.Here is a film that is incredibly over the top and at times ludicrous, even for a science fiction film, but it still holds up as an entertaining watch. It relies on it's stunning production design and overall style as well as the well played out action sequences. Jodie Foster did not live up to the expectations set by her previous films and at times was even laughable. Matt Damon delivered an alright performance and Sharlto Copley was as entertaining as ever. 'Elysium' is no 'District 9″, but it still holds it's own in the large spectrum of science fiction cinema.",7,2,5,10 August 2013
The Conjuring," Unsettling, rather than scary. 7.5/10
","James Wan's 'The Conjuring' is one of my most anticipated films of this year. Wan, the director of the original 'Saw' film as well as 2011's 'Insidious' has a fair amount of experience in the field of horror. Although, he has had some missteps, 2007's 'Dead Silence' was a joke of a horror film and did not live up to the expectations set by his previous work. He is also directing the upcoming sequel to 'Insidious', which I am looking forward to. His newest film, 'The Conjuring' is packed with an all star cast. Starring are Vera Farmiga, Lily Taylor, Ron Livingston and Patrick Wilson. Based on the true story of famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who have participated in such paranormal investigations as the infamous 'Amityville Horror' case as well as many others. The film is centered around their supposedly 'most terrifying' case that has not been revealed until now. In the first few scenes we see the Perron family, Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor), Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) and their many daughters. They are moving into their new home, a remote farmhouse located in Rhode Island. Having settled in, the family heads to bed. In the morning, they wake up to find that every single clock in the house has stopped at exactly 3:07 AM as well as a foul stench seeping through the floor and walls. Not to mention a shocking discover made by their youngest daughter, Christine. Over the course of a few days, strange events begin to occur in the Perron house and it becomes evident that something is terribly wrong. In desperate strides to protect her family, Carolyn seeks the help of noted paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, it takes her some convincing, but the two decide to help her. After inspecting the Perron house, it is clear to the Warren's that something evil has latched itself onto it.First of all, I will say that I greatly enjoyed this film, but it did not genuinely frighten me. Normally, I would dismiss a horror film if it would fail to frighten me, but in the case of 'The Conjuring' there is so much more backing up the film that the scares don't feel as important as they should. This is a very well made film, the set design and camera-work showcase James Wan's impressive directorial presence as well as set up a chilling atmosphere. If I were to pick a work to describe my feelings whilst watching the film, it would probably be, 'unsettled'. The entire cast deliver exceptional performances, which is no surprise when working with such highly talented actors. My main problem with 'The Conjuring' is that at times it feels very predictable and uninspired story wise. Other than that, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Conjuring'. I am convinced that James Wan has the potential to be a fantastic director.It did not scare me, but the fantastic production value and the performances delivered by the actors along with James Wan's eerie direction had me invested in the film all the way through. 'The Conjuring' managed to unsettle me as well as provide a gripping story and worthwhile characters.",7,0,1,2 August 2013
The Wolverine," Over the top, but fun. 6.5/10
","After the outright terrible 'X Men Origins: Wolverine', 'Marvel' has come out with another 'Wolverine' movie in hopes of redeeming themselves after their colossal failure. When it comes to 'Marvel' character's, 'Wolverine' must be my favorite of them all. I was a big fan of the 'X-Men' movies (except for 'The Last Stand'), despite their many plot holes and missteps, I remained a fan. The character of 'Wolverine' has always to me been the most fascinating of the 'X-Men' team. With his backstory being so vast, there seemed to be an unlimited amount of potential for his character. This is a character that always had a more mature feel for him, even when placed in campy stories. In 'The Wolverine', Hugh Jackman returns to play the title role of the film for the sixth time. Following the events of 'X-Men: The Last Stand', Logan, also known as 'The Wolverine' has gone back to Canada to hide in a cave in the mountains surrounding a small, town. Once a proud member of the 'X-Men' Logan has become a reclusive nobody, growing a large beard and regressing to the state of a broken man. After getting into a bar fight, Logan is approached by a mysterious woman named Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who offers him to go to Japan to visit a friend from his past. This friend is none other than Japan's wealthiest man Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), who's life Logan saved during the second world war. Yashida is dying of an unknown disease and has invested billions of dollars to keep him alive, but his time is running out. He gives Logan a proposition, for Logan to transmit his healing powers to Yashida so that he can live a normal life and eventually die. Or as he puts it 'liberating' him from his eternal pain.The action and fight sequences are pretty impressive, but at times they feel so over the top that it is hard to take them seriously. I like the fact that this is a movie that was not scared to stray into more mature territory despite being rated PG-13. I'm not a fan of extreme violence, which granted there is none of in this movie, but it was interesting to see a fair amount of blood in this seeing as 'Marvel' movies are usually on the more campy side of the spectrum. The problem with this film is that there are a fair amount of little plot holes and incoherences that took me out of the movie at times. The visual effects and cinematography satisfy, though this is definitely not one of the main focus points in the movie. The performances are nothing special, Hugh Jackman does what he did before, the brooding and dangerous character, but in the case of this movie, he did bring a more dramatic and intimate side to the character of Wolverine that we haven't seen that much before. All the performances were fine, except for Svetlana Khodchenkova's performance which was terrible. Her character felt so fake an exaggerated that it was downright painful to watch.If you're looking for something fun and enjoyable, I would definitely recommend it, but as anything else than a fun movie, it does not really hold up. The action is over the top, despite having some well made fight sequences and the plot is lacking substance, although I am pleased to say that this movie went into mature territory and gave the character of 'Wolverine' some much needed humane aspects.",6,0,4,26 July 2013
Monsters University," Fluffy and heartwarming
","The prequel to one of my favorite animated films, 'Monsters University' brings back the classic characters from 'Monsters Inc.' and tells the story of their university days. John Goodman and Billy Crystal return as the voices of Sully and Mike and the supporting cast is full of stars like Helen Mirren and Steve Buscemi who returns as Randall Boggs. The story mainly revolves around Mike. Ever since he was a child he had dreams of becoming a 'scarer' and has waited almost his whole life to go to 'Monsters University'. Upon his arrival, he doesn't seem to fit in well at the 'Scare School' despite all his efforts, he just isn't scary. During the final exams of the semester Mike starts an argument with Sully, who then was a jock and accidentally destroys a famed relict. both of them are kicked out of the 'scare program'. They are forced to team up with a fraternity and put their differences aside to participate in the annual 'Scare Games' because it's their only chance to get back into the 'scare program'.As expected from 'Pixar', the animation is sleek, colorful and just plain beautiful. They animators have done a great job at bringing the monsters to life and making them as creative as can be. Billy Chrystal and John Goodman display their impeccable talent for voice acting and make the characters even more vivid and comical. The problem with this film is that it tends to feel really campy at times and strays from the original, which can be a good thing, but since 'Monsters Inc.' was going for a darker tone when it came to the overall style, I would have liked for this film to do the same. The one thing that struck me about 'Monsters University' is that it didn't go for the idealistic, predictable ending, but took a more realistic approach to the story even if it was about monsters.It is campy, but it is a lot of fun. The beautiful animation and superb voice acting make the monsters in the film visually impressive as well as comical. It does not buy in to family movie cliché's despite being reminiscent of a 'Revenge of the Nerds' type story. 'Monsters University' is a visual delight and will go by in a flash.",7,1,1,16 July 2013
The Purge," Glorifying stupidity?
","What looked like a somewhat promising thriller turned out to be plain awful, other than the creepy masks the purgers wear, this movie is not even remotely scary. Set in the near future, the United States government legalizes all crimes for a period of twelve hours every year for an event known as 'Purge Night'. Ethan Hawke plays a man named James Sandin, who has gained a substantial amount of wealth selling security systems to wealthy neighborhoods. The purge has reformed the United States. Crime is at an all time low and the economy is flourishing. Even Sandin's wealthy neighbors take part in the purgefor fun. At home, Sandin is awaited by his trophy wife Mary, played by Lena Heady and his two children, who do a great job at making the worst decisions imaginable and acting like total morons. As the purge begins, the Sandin's lock up as per usual. Later on, as the night falls, James' son Charlie sees an injured man walking down the street and begging for help through the house's security camera and gets an oh so sudden moral obligation to help him. He let's the man into the house. For the sake of the plot, purgers arrive at the Sandin's door.This film is just, for lack of a better word..retarded! The characters make sudden horrible choices and make the story not only feel cheap, but incredibly stupid. The child actors in this film are horrible and the characters they portray are even worse. I mean (and I know i'm ranting) their father does everything to protect them and they basically spit in his face. The initial concept of 'The Purge' seemed genuinely fascinating, but it is presented so badly and over-exaggerated to such extremes that it becomes laughable! Not to mention the horrible production. The blood/gore effects looked like something out of a student film and the cinematography felt like it was for a cheap, and I mean really cheap TV movie and the sound effects for the guns sound like their taken from 'Garry's Mod' or some other video game. Ethan Hawke is the only one who delivers a decent performance. Lena Headey is not a bad actress and she could have had an exceptional performance if the plot and her character weren't as dumb. God, I couldn't stand this movie. I know i'm being very critical, but it was just awful! It could only pass as a cheap film that you watch on TV when you have absolutely nothing to do.'The Purge' is predictable, dumb and annoying. Ethan Hawke gives the only decent performance, but still fails to save the movie in any way. Topped off by a ludicrous plot and horrible visuals, 'The Purge' is an example of a interesting idea gone terribly wrong.",3,2,3,18 July 2013
The Great Gatsby," The 20s and rap music
","Just recently, I had read F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel 'The Great Gatsby' in preparation for Baz Luhrmann's new film that bears the same name. 'The Great Gatsby' stars Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, an aspiring writer and war veteran who is struggling to make a profit after entering the bonds business. He moves into a small cottage on Long Island, where just over on the other side of the bay lives his cousin Daisy Buchanan, played by Carey Mulligan and her snobbish husband Tom, played by Joel Edgerton. Next to his humble cottage stands a massive palace owned by a wealthy businessman shrouded in mystery named Jay Gatsby. New York inhabitants flock to his home every weekend where he holds grand parties. In this case invitations are not necessary, though Nick seems to be the only one invited. Upon his arrival, Nick is bedazzled by the shear scale of the party. He bumps into a woman named Jordan Baker, a famous sportswoman who he had met earlier whilst visiting his cousin's house. They decide to search for the party's host, Mr. Gatsby. Purely by accident, Nick seems to come face to face with the man himself. As the story progresses we discover more about Gatsby and his somewhat unusual past.The film has been constantly advertised as a thrilling and energetic adaptation of the novel, but after seeing it i'm not sure that's a good thing. Where the novel was subtle and elegant, the film is outlandish and at times even a bit obnoxious. As with such films as 'Moulin Rouge' and 'Romeo + Juliet', Luhrmann seems to focus more on the style of the film and undermines the story. Though, I can't deny that the film looks beautiful, even if the style feels overbearing. People have criticized the use of modern day music, I personally thought this was a bold choice that played out very well on screen. The music helped set the scene for the parties and added a certain charm to the classic setting. Surprisingly, the 3D was unusually well done. I'm really not a fan of this so whenever I go see a 3D movie it tends to feel like a chore. In this case it really helped to immerse me in the story, as well as create beautiful visuals. On an acting level everyone delivered solid performances. Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan, Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgerton were all fine. The supporting actors were also just as good. Isla Fisher and Elisabeth Debicki did a great job at showing the contrast between different types of people in the society of the late 20′s. Whilst Fisher's character was vulgar and provocative Debicki's was sleek and classy.In hindsight, Luhrmann's adaptation of Fitzgerald's classic novel can be obnoxious due to the overbearing style of the film, but it also provides the viewer with beautiful visuals, well acted performances and a well paced story. It establishes itself as a faithful and energetic imagining of the book. It certainly is not as great as it has been advertised to be, but it still is pretty good.",7,0,3,16 July 2013
