Men in Black 3," Just not the same
","I am used to Will Smith doing its comical sarcastic tone in both the first MIB and second MIB. That is what really set it off for me to enjoy both movies. In this movie (MIB3) Time has cough up to Smith. He had some good laughs but it seems like it has been toned down quite a bit. He no longer has that energetic presence on the screen and he no longer has the over the top gestures and faces. Josh brings a fresh look at the film. Must be that Tommy is also tired and old to do a lot of the scenes that Josh does that is why Smith was the only one in thus Time Jump.The things I like about the movie is that they definitively kept the roots of the movie. Same tone, same music, and even fonts on the credits :)MIB3 was not the best of all three, but it was the most touching of all. K was training a replacement (MIB), K finds The Light of Zartha(MIB2), and now K has always been grumpy because he had to cope with Js loss of his father in 1969. Great film for the family and very good all around, just needed Smith to take it up a notch. It is was made the other two movies great.",5,2,6,10 June 2012
