The Avengers," Still one of the best...
","I just watched this again, the better part of a decade after it came out, and I absolutely still believe this movie is a 10/10. It's the best Marvel movie of them all IMHO.",10,2,3,31 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Well, they tried.
","I'm giving this a 6, which is the lowest rating I'll give a movie while still recommending to see it.Should you see it? Obviously yes, if you're a fan of SW.
Is it good? No. It isn't. But they really tried to make it good.Kilo Ren and Rey put together are not as interesting or exciting as watching paint dry. I just have to say that.And one more thing... While I'm no fan of Daisy Ridley, I do like looking at her. She is beyond words smoldering hot, especially in her lil star wars outfit.That is all.",6,2,7,9 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," WAY over hyped and overrated
","VERY overrated, wow this is so definitely NOT Tarantino's best work. Jeesh it kinda sucks to be truly honest. Decaprio is gold as always and Pitt does a fairly meh job of supporting but you can't carry a movie on just the acting. It isn't a good movie.",5,0,0,7 July 2020
