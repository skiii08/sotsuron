United 93," Skip the popcorn - you won't be able to eat watching this one.
","I was interested in seeing this film but apprehensive as to the films content. With a leap of faith, I decided to see the film on the big screen and make my own judgment. I found it to be moving, gripping, emotional and not at all the cheap docu-drama I feared. I agree the theater was silent at the film's ending. I agree there were a few touching moments where viewers will be reaching for a hankie. I'm glad I decided to see the film and I don't know of any film I would begin to compare it to. I won't say I enjoyed watching the movie. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. I will say I am glad I saw the film and especially on the big screen. No need to buy the popcorn or Pepsi - my stomach was in knots and I couldn't eat. This is not a munch on snacks and watch kind of movie. It is fast paced and you have to pay attention to get all the details. I had a thought driving home after seeing United 93 that I want to be a better person, a better friend and a better American. It is hard to watch but, I'm glad I saw United 93 in the theater.",8,0,2,7 May 2006
