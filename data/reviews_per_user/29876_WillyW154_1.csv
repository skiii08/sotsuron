The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," I am disappointed
","I am so disappointed of the movie. And that's because there happens close to nothing. At nearly every point you notice it's stretched for making out of one book two movies. At the beginning I liked it, because many parts of the book found their way into the movie. But I realised transferring the story of a book 1:1 into a movie isn't that good.(NO SPOILER) As an example they need about 5-10 minutes just to go down a staircase, back upwards because 'missing' something and down again. And nothing really happens. All the time absolutely no excitement rose in me and I just got bored. And I am pretty sure this should be a part where your heartbeat is meant to been rising.Sure there are some nice and decent scenes but most of the stuff is just lame. In the book it works but clearly not in the Movie (plus the showdown of the book is missing because of the split).But at least I enjoyed the screenplay of Josh Hutcherson and Philip Seymour Hoffman, which lifted the Movie 'up' to 3 Stars. I hope the last one gets back on the level of the first two movies.",3,316,535,19 November 2014
