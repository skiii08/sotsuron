Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," I enjoyed it
","Being a long time Johnny Depp fan some say I am a little biased towards his work but I have enjoyed all four installments of the Pirates franchise. The latest installment is not my favourite but still very entertaining.My only complaint is the toning down of Captain Jack Sparrows personality, I am unsure why that was done.Being mostly set on land bought the story back to reality while introducing some new characters who did not take over the whole movie as they seemed to do in the past two.I would probably not recommend this movie for the very young as there were a few scenes which gave me a little fright but in all I recommend seeing this movie with an open mind and no expectations of seeing anything relating to the past three.",8,1,2,19 May 2011
