The Blair Witch Project," A very original scary movie
","I loved the concept of this movie: three filmmakers who intend to film a documentary and end up getting lost and tormented by the Blair Witch.  And the fact that the entire premise was made up is very cool.  The filmmakers of this movie were very clever in coming up with an idea that no one else has.  Unfortunately, many clones will probably result because of all of the success the movie has had.  All of the hype that surrounded this movie drove me to see it.  I am a big fan of scary movies and wanted to see what made this movie so different from the rest of the pack.  I appreciate the fright factor in the film.  The fact that there is no bad guy is a very different concept and a chilling one at that.  In all of the scary movies that I've seen there is a bad guy who invades your thoughts and you end up thinking about that night in your darkened bedroom.  But in this movie there was no bad guy... which seemed to me to be ten times scarier.  While I was watching the movie, I anticipated much more than was shown to me on the screen.  I kept waiting for something to happen... yet hardly anything did.  Here I can see why people did not like the movie.  The element of the movie is suspense, but in our society we are used to thrills and chills and immediate action.  The ending had my friends and me arguing for weeks.  Ambiguous endings can be good for a film.  In that way, you can put your own spin on what just happened on the screen.  When the movie ended, I was initially disappointed.  But this is one movie that gets under your skin with its unanswered questions.  You think about it more and more and wonder what really happened out there in the woods.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie for the most part.",7,1,1,5 September 1999
The Ring," Chilling to the core *spoilers*
","Initially, after seeing the vague previews for The Ring, I had no desire to see the movie.  After all, the trailers simply showed a random bunch of clips from the movie muddled together with various noises and movie dialogue instead of directly telling me what the movie was about.After the movie opened, however, I heard all of the buzz about the film and decided that it was worth a try.  What a treat this movie was.  It seems that finally Hollywood is getting the suspenseful movie down pat for this day and age.  After years of silly teen horror flicks that managed not to chill the spine but tickle the funny bone, the filmmakers of today are turning to older, more subtle methods of finding ways to scare its audiences.  Any classic filmmaker, such as Hitchcock, one of the masters of suspense, can tell you that less is more; you don't have to show a massive amount of blood and gore to induce fear.  All you have to do is create a thoughtful movie with an engaging plot that meanders its way through the movie, building on our fears until the ultimate climax.This is what The Ring aimed to do and succeeded greatly.  I went into this movie on pins and needles and was like that all the way through until the end.  The opening sequence grabbed at my attention through its mystery and imagery.  I like the fact that the movie shows you the tape when Rachel views it, the first chronological movie time that it is viewed, instead of making you wait until closer to the end.  I really liked how all of the elements of the tape are explained somewhere throughout the film, and a brief flashback of the tape is shown in order to remind you where you saw it first.  At first I was annoyed by the presence of a young boy in the film, seeing as it might be another clone of Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense, but David Dorfman is not overused; he is in the right number of scenes, and his importance is still felt.  Naomi Watts did a terrific job as the mother who learns her lesson about listening to her child the hard way. When Rachel and Noah found Samara's body in the well, I thought that this was the end of the movie, so the demise of Noah in a later scene gave me a satisfying jolt.  There are so many people that have been posting negative comments about this movie, saying that the ending is ambiguous and that there are plot holes in the movie.  Well, honestly think about it... do the best movies lay everything out on the table, completely clear-cut, that you understand it immediately?  Perhaps for some people, but for me... I like a good thinker. I like a movie that gets in your head and makes you think about it long after you've left the theater, movies that you argue with your friends about, that you debate the meanings of.  The Ring is one of these movies. Sure, there are questions that I have about this movie that I would love to have answered.  But I prefer to make up my own theories about them for now... at least until the sequel comes out (which hopefully will be just as good).  Isn't that half the fun of watching a movie?9/10",Null,0,0,4 November 2002
Memento," Don't Believe His Lies... (spoilers & questions)
","This movie is the first truly original film that I have seen in a long time. I was intrigued from the opening credits until the very end.  This movie does, however, make you think quite a bit.  It captures your attention by the way that it puts you practically in Leonard's condition by telling the story backwards.  When I saw that someone had been killed in the beginning (or the end of the story, rather), I thought to myself that it was no fun because I already knew who the bad guy was.  But that was the exact OPPOSITE of what I came to believe after the next two hours.  Although this movie does leave quite a few unanswered questions, this feeling of wonder as the movie ends is almost comforting, because you can make up your own ending to the story and what YOU think actually happened.  I recommend that anyone who has seen this movie visit the website at otnemem.com.  You will find out even more information to pique your curiosity.
Now for the **SPOILERS**.I have been thinking about this movie and what happened in it during the past 24 hours and think I understand, but maybe could use a bit of help from anyone else willing to offer it.  In my opinion, Leonard and his wife were attacked in their home and Leonard was left with his condition.  He tattooed 'remember Sammy Jankis' as a reminder to himself to pass of his own situation as someone else's.  This is a memory that he always remembered to share with others due to this reminder.  The diabetes situation was actually his own and his wife died from an insulin overdose.  He set off to find his wife's 'murderer' so he could erase guilt of causing her death from the insulin (I'm unsure about if he would even feel guilt because of his condition).  I believe that Teddy and Jimmy were in the drug business together and Teddy set Jimmy up to be killed by Leonard.  Natalie found out and helped Leonard onto the trail of Teddy (more than he had already helped himself).  I'm still a bit fuzzy on the whole Dodd situation. 
***Questions: There was one scene in the movie where they showed Sammy in the mental institution, and, maybe it was just me, but for a BRIEF SECOND I could SWEAR that they imposed Leonard sitting in the institute just where Sammy had been sitting.  From what it says on the website, Leonard was in a mental institution.  Did anyone else see this?Another thing that I think I saw near the end of the movie... the polariod that Leonard received under the door of the hotel showed him smiling and pointing at a spot on his chest.  For a brief second as he was flashing back to thoughts of his wife, she was curled up on his chest and the tattoo 'I DID IT' could be seen in that very spot.  Did anyone else see THIS? 
Bottom line: Great movie, very original, and way intriguing. 9/10",9,0,1,28 April 2001
American Pie," Grows finer with every viewing
","I saw this movie for the third time last night and must say that it gets better every time I see it.  True, it is vulgar and disgusting, but it is great fun.  It is truly a movie about the youth of America.  It is hilarious and will not leave you disappointed.  This is one slice of pie that you do not want to leave untouched if you crave a delicious comedy.",9,0,0,26 October 1999
Cast Away," Hooray for Wilson!
","I have seen this movie twice and both times when I walked out, there were people complaining about the movie and declaring that it was boring and unlikeable.  I would have to say the opposite.  The plane crash was extremely realistic and intense and happens quickly after the movie begins. The action on the island is RIVETING.  You are constantly interested to find out what Chuck Noland does next and it is amazing how he is able to use the contents of the FedEx boxes.  Tom Hanks turns in a fabulous performance with little words and big gestures, and also by losing weight for an awesome transformation after his four years on the island.  He was ROBBED to not get the Oscar for Best Actor this year. The movie even made a mere volleyball an interesting character.  You scoff now, but you'll grow to love Wilson and his tree hair extensions.  In any other movie, there would have been typical Hollywood details thrown in... a beautiful mermaid living on the island to keep Chuck company, a shark attack while he is riding on his raft, Chuck managing to have a packet of waterproof matches on him when his ship goes down... ANYTHING unrealistic.  This movie manages to stay true to its cause and explores the dire situation of being stranded out on an island in a simple, yet effective way.  The ending of the movie was a bit overdrawn, but the 'ambiguous' ending satisfied me, so that I could come up with my own ending for Chuck.  When you first hear that the movie has Tom Hanks in nearly an hour of film time with dialogue... you wonder how it can be entertaining.  But oh boy, it surely is.  Don't miss it.9/10",9,0,0,28 April 2001
Pitch Black," Diesel's Big Breakout
","I have seen Pitch Black two times and am still not sure that I completely understand everything that happened within it.  I saw this movie thinking that it was in the same vein of classics like Alien and Aliens.  However, it is a very intense sci-fi movie that is a lot more than it seems.  Many of the main characters seem like they may have a certain agenda, but they have underlying ulterior motives for their actions, which made it very interesting to see how they progressed throughout the film on the remote planet.Radha Mitchell did a great job in the film as the crew's reluctant captain who at first wants to pitch the civilians in the spaceship in order to save herself and then learns to accept the leadership of the others that she has come to take charge of.  The other minor characters were good as innocent civilians placed in a dire situation to deal with.  But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as convict Richard B. Riddick, who manages to be menacing to the ship's passengers for the first half hour without even uttering a word. While this film does not showcase all of Diesel's talents, it proves that he is a rising star within Hollywood.While I did enjoy this movie, there were a few plot holes that I couldn't seem to overlook.  How does Riddick know so much about these aliens on the planet?  How plausible is it that the spaceship would crash land on the planet on the very same day that an eclipse that happens once every 22 years occurs?  How in the world is Riddick able to stare down one of the aliens when any other character's heads would have been snapped off immediately? Why is it that these characters that need to stick together in such a dire circumstance always seem to be losing each other, always asking 'Where's so and so'?  And did you notice how quickly the sun(s) seemed to set in the movie?Overall, entertaining, but a few minor plot holes.7/10",Null,0,1,21 March 2002
Pearl Harbor," A massive disappointment
","This year, when the summer movies rolled around in May, there was one movie that I was dying to see: Pearl Harbor.  I have enjoyed the work of Ben Affleck and thought that this movie would be the perfect balance of action and romance.  However, I left the theater massively disappointed.  I appreciate the attempt that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer made to create a cross-gender classic for the ages, but the result fell flat.  The best thing about the movie was the bombing sequence in the middle.  This section captured my attention fully with its raw power and emotional action.  It was one of the best action sequences in recent history.  The portion of the movie leading up to the bombing was a huge bore.  Could the romance between Rafe and Evelyn be more pathetic and moronic?  I found myself rolling my eyes when Rafe popped himself in the nose with a champagne cork rather than smiling in pleasure.  Because of this movie, I am not as big of a fan as Affleck.  He is good in supporting roles, but he does not have the stature to lead a blockbuster.  The position of his frown seems to be the range of his emotional acting ability.  And what was with the way that he kept wearing his hat cocked to the side?  Did he see it on a WWII documentary and thought that it looked cool?  I was hugely annoyed by the character of Evelyn, whose emotional strife was poorly played by Kate Beckinsdale.  It seemed like she was constantly lying to both of her suitors and trying to play helpless.  The only shining performance was of Josh Hartnett, and even his luscious bangs cannot save this movie.  Nearing the end of the movie, I was wishing that both Rafe and Danny would crash and burn and that Evelyn wouldn't be able to have either of them.",Null,0,0,12 August 2001
The Insider," A template for others to follow
","The Insider is an absolutely wonderful movie.  What made it especially great is that it didn't rely solely on action and explosions to boost its interest level, as most movies out there do, but instead it chose to lean on tension to keep the audience riveted.  Not only did I find the movie extremely interesting, I found myself learning a thing or two about television production and tobacco companies.  I felt extreme sympathy for Jeffrey Wigand as he struggled to reveal the truth about tobacco to the American public.  Russell Crowe may have misstepped in Mystery, Alaska, but he is back to the height of his acting in The Insider, a powerful performance rivaling the one he gave in L.A. Confidential.  Al Pacino was fabulous as well.  I know that this film was early in release, but I hope that when Oscar nominations come out that this film is not forgotten.  This movie is one that is completely rewarding, and its use of tension as the source of interest for the audience should be use in more movies that are being made.",10,0,0,4 December 1999
Toy Story," Fun for both parents and kids
","I finally got a chance to see this movie and I thought that it was absolutely wonderful.  The computer animation is phenomenal, creating an entirely new world which is extremely realistic.  The story was adorable as were all of the characters.  What I especially enjoyed about this movie was that it was aimed primarily toward children through its animation and light subject matter, but there were jokes aimed at adults so that the movie would be an experience that the entire family could enjoy.  I wish that more movies were like this nowadays.",8,0,0,4 December 1999
Toy Story 2," Act casual... not THAT casual!
","I missed both Toy Story 1 and 2 in the theaters, but recently have seen both on video.  These two movies are truly treasures of the animation age.  I have never before been so amused and entertained by a children's movie.  It is difficult to say if the sequel is better than the original because they are both so wonderful.  I love the spin on Woody and Buzz's friendship in the sequel so that Buzz has to save Woody just as his friend did for him earlier.  The characters are all so lively and brighten up a simple toy design that they were created from.  The new characters that belonged to Woody's Roundup were great and hilarious.  It takes quite a bit to get me to cry in a movie, but somehow every time I see the part where Jessie delves into her past with Emily to the tune of 'When She Loved Me,' I can't keep a dry eye!  Once again, as with the original, the little three-eyed aliens steal the show.  What a fun movie for both kids and adults... I find something wonderful about it that I didn't notice before every time I see it.  Here's hoping for a Toy Story 3!10/10",10,0,1,28 April 2001
Titanic," Overrated
","Many of my friends have bought Titanic now that it is available on videocassette, yet I have only seen it once.  I believe that this movie is horribly overrated.  I am not saying that I did not enjoy the movie, because I did.  It was a very interesting account of the lives of two central people aboard the Titanic, one of the worst disasters in history.  The real excitement hit when the boat hit the iceberg.  The movie kept my attention from then on out.  Many people say that this movie is the best movie ever created.  I beg to differ.  In my opinion, the best movie ever made is Gone With the Wind.  You just can't compare to such an epic.  Titanic doesn't even come close.  When you really boil the movie down, it merely is a dressed up romance with an action/adventure tagged onto it.  It is a very exciting movie, but I prefer to see it only once, and it does not compare to the classic old movies which have stood the test of time.",6,2,3,29 October 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Transcends its source in leaps and bounds
","I never expected to have a movie about prison be among my ten favorite movies of all time, but The Shawshank Redemption stands in that category. This, however, is no ordinary prison movie.  It is a movie that cuts to the core of the human psyche and exposes the ideas of hope, strength, and survival all within the character of Andy Dufresne.I recently finished reading the short story 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Remption' on which this movie is based.  While the story is a great one and Stephen King is an exceptionally talented writer, I believe that this film manages to take a small morsel of a story and stretch its meaning and characters out into a fully engrossing film that will reach the viewer on all levels.  Tim Robbins does an excellent job as the complex Andy Dufresne and shows the range of emotions that Andy comes to feel during his sentence within his actions and expressions.  While the character of Red is a white Irishman in the story, the movie chooses to make him black and cast Morgan Freeman.  This was a wise choice and Freeman brings his immense talent to the character on screen, displaying Red's cunning nature and raw emotion. All of the other major characters are given more life in the movie than the book, and work well together to create the prison atmosphere of Shawshank. While reading the book, I kept expecting to read about one of my favorite scenes in the movie, where Andy locks the warden's office door and plays the uplifting opera music for all of the inmates.  This is an excellent addition that made the movie even more effective.  The twist ending where Andy gives the warden his 'just desserts' in the movie is more satisfying than when it is omitted in the book.So there are people out there who call this movie overrated.  Maybe it is. It does tend to pull at your emotions in various ways throughout its runtime.  And it manages to touch many different sensitive issues that people hold dear.  But it has such a strong message and so many effective scenes that you can't help but enjoy it.  This movie made me, a naive high school student upon my first viewing, take a deeper look at life, the impact of hope, and the effects of prison.  Forrest Gump is an excellent movie, but I don't understand why the Academy chose to reward it instead of The Shawshank Redemption.Call it overrated if you like, but it's still one of my favorites.10/10",10,0,0,21 March 2002
Signs," You almost had me, M. Night...
","Having seen the intense trailers for Signs, I went into the movie with high expectations.  I had enjoyed The Sixth Sense immensely and tolerated Unbreakable, but was ready to try M. Night Shyamalan's latest offering.  I must say, the first hour and a half were absolutely spectacular.  Being a huge fan of classic movies by Hitchcock, I enjoyed the suspenseful way that the story unfolded and drew me in.  More of Hollywood needs to understand that in a truly excellent suspense movie, less is more, as demonstrated through the buildup of this movie.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.However, the last ten minutes of the movie cheapened the effect for me. While Shyamalan has become well known for his fantastic twist endings, this one felt silly and tacked on.  And once I saw what was so carefully and meticulously hidden throughout the rest of the movie, I was disappointed. 
M. Night Shyamalan is a talented director and writer, and his ideas are very original and refreshing.  However, he as of yet is no Hitchcock.  Hopefully his next offering will buoy him up again in my mind.",Null,0,1,11 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," A very spooky movie
","Recently I went to see this movie and thought that it was excellent.  I especially enjoyed the performance of Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  This boy is a gifted young actor who will hopefully be around for a long time.  Bruce Willis played kind of a second banana to the wonderful Osment, but he was still at top form.  The chemistry between the two was fabulous, and you could tell that they shared a bond.  The ending really sold it for me. Overall the movie is very spooky, but entertaining.",8,0,0,4 September 1999
Gladiator," Great movie? Yes! Best picture? Hmmmm...
","I saw Gladiator last May and really enjoyed it.  I have never seen a movie of this scope and dealing with this subject, so I thought that it was original for today's types of movies.  I am a big fan of Russell Crowe and thought that he did a great job in the title role of Maximus.  He is a very strong character who follows his own path and ideas, but shows a tender side in his desire to be with his family.  The majority of the cast was great, especially Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus.  He has a very strong talent and will be sure to make an impact in movies in the future.  However, I thought that Connie Neilsen's Lucilla was a bit weak and while she did display some independence in her actions and thoughts, she still held true to the standards of typical women's roles.  While I did think that the movie was great, it was hardly the best picture of 2000... but I'm not sure what would be instead.  It was a fairly weak year for the movies in comparison with recent years, especially 1999.  It was nice to see Russell Crowe win the Oscar for best actor, but he should have received it LAST year for his stirring portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand instead of Maximus.  His performance in Gladiator was excellent, but somehow it did not measure up to his former role.  I still believe that Tom Hanks was robbed for not getting an Oscar instead!7/10",7,0,0,28 April 2001
