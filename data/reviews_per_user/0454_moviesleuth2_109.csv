The Rock," Why don't they make movies like this anymore?
","In the past, many summer action movies were geared towards adults (at least in theory) with R-rated violence, and a lot of intelligent plot twists and good characterizations. Some examples were the 'Die Hard' movies, 'True Lies,' and 'The Rock.' Sadly, those days are gone, with today's summer action movies being dumbed down and neutered to get every kid from the target audience into the theater (the fact that movies make a ton of money if they are good no matter what the rating still hasn't occurred to the producers).'The Rock' represents a farewell to this kind of movie. It's very violent, but for the most part not very heavy. The story is compelling, and it has plenty of original ideas and characters that are actually intelligent. The actors do terrific jobs, and the action sequences are tightly done. There are some one-liners to be sure, but not enough to make the movie an action-comedy. It's one of those movies that is the definition of what a summer action movie is supposed to be.The story formula is familiar, but the creators do enough with it that it seems fresh and alive. An angered general takes Alcatraz hostage and aims missiles armed with deadly gas at San Francisco. The US government sends a team of Navy Seals in to take them down. Joining them are a 'chemical weapons specialist' and the one man who escaped from Alcatraz.With names like Steven Segal and Arnold Schwartzenegger, two of Hollywood's most notoriously wooden actors (Schwartzenegger's 'True Lies' being an exception), being some of the most famous poster-boys of the summer action movie genre, it would be sensible to guess that like most other action movies, acting is not a plus point. On the contrary, acting one of the reasons why this movie works so well. Every actor is believable in his role. Nicholas Cage, fresh off of his Oscar win for 'Leaving Las Vegas,' is perfectly understated in the fish-out-of-water role. He's a self-described 'chemical weapons super-freak,' but he's grounded enough for the audience to sympathize with him. John Mason may be a character that many talented actors could play, but after watching this movie, it's hard to imagine any other actor than Sean Connery playing it this well. I guess it makes sense for the original James Bond to still be doing this halfway into his sixties, but clearly age hasn't taken its toll on Connery at this point because he performs the role with a slick wit and the capability of firing a gun without reading glasses (haha). Probably the most important role here is that of General Hummel (Ed Harris). Though he's a villain, the way Harris portrays the character is key to the movie's success. As villainous as Hummel is for doing what he does, Harris plays Hummel with such passion that the character comes to life and he believes every word that he is saying. This is key because it makes the situation that much more serious, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. If you can't believe in what the villain is saying, than who cares? The supporting actors are great as well. John Spencer, William Forsythe, the vastly under-rated Michael Biehn, and a charming performance by Vanessa Marcil (why she doesn't get any big roles is beyond me, cause while not the best actress, she's certainly a lot better than many of the more popular beauties out there).Bruckheimer favorite Michael Bay is returning after directing 'Bad Boys,' which while not bad, it pales at the likes of 'The Rock' (then again, not much else can match up to this movie). Armed with a better script and a more compelling story, Bay makes it clear that when it comes to directing action movies, he is a force to be reckoned with. He knows exactly what he's doing. Every action sequence is expertly choreographed, and the pacing is perfect. Though the end has a distinct lack of intelligence that's not present in the rest of the film, I am more than willing to forgive because it's still tremendously exciting anyway. It's hard to imagine a movie that's more exciting or suspenseful than this.As I said before, 'The Rock' represents the last of its kind: the summer action movie for adults. Though few would disagree that the MPAA is notoriously easy-going when it comes to rating a movie based on violence, even the MPAA knew it couldn't get away with giving this one anything less than an R. There's a lot of violence here, and a lot of it is intense. Some of the scenes are hard to watch. I would definitely recommend at least previewing it first before showing it to anyone under the age of 15. Though this limits the target audience, this is a good decision because in order for suspense and excitement to take place, what happens on screen has to get our attention, and the in-your-face approach that an R rating allows accomplishes this. Additionally, the audience has to buy the premise, preferably within its own context. Sometimes this can be rather disturbing in some sense, but that makes the action believable, which is key for suspense. An action movie like this with a PG-13 rating loses that intimacy, which inevitably reduces the excitement level. This is a shame because some movies with the potential to be really exciting have been ruined by producer neutering (Jerry Bruckheimer has completely 'sold out' by doing this for EVERY movie that he does now-'Pearl Harbor' would be a great example of this).Fast-paced, relentless, and terrifically exciting, 'The Rock' is probably the best farewell to the adult-oriented summer action movie genre that one could hope for.",10,4,6,27 May 2008
The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino was MADE for these kinds of movies!
","He may not be the film's central character, but John Milton is the best part of 'The Devil's Advocate.' John Milton is a role that only Al Pacino could do. It's the kind of film that Al Pacino is born to do, and he sinks his teeth into it.Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a hot-shot lawyer who has never lost a case. This pushes his vanity to the extreme, so much so that the truth really doesn't matter, he just wants to win. This attracts the attention of John Milton (Al Pacino), who offers him a job that's too good to refuse. His lovely but increasingly unstable wife (Charlize Theron) at first supports him, but she begins to fall apart quickly.Even without its little touches and in-jokes, 'The Devil's Advocate' would be a great film. But the story is taken to the next level with its little ironies (as in the the fact that the Devil is the head of a big law firm, and he chose the name John Milton).What's really surprising is that this film lives up to repeat viewings. Most films with twist endings lose much, if not all, of their effect after the first viewing. While 'The Devil's Advocate' will probably be a better experience if the viewer knows nothing about it, it still works even if you know that Milton is the Devil. That said, it's kind of obvious even without watching much of the film. Luckily, director Taylor Hackford understands this. While the truth of Milton's real identity is sort of a mystery, it isn't the film's only mystery, nor is it the film's biggest twist. That, and it's kind of obvious early in the film.Special effects are usually only good in big budget summer action flicks. But 'The Devil's Advocate' is not an action flick, and it has some impressive visuals.The acting is great all around. Pacino undoubtedly owns this film, but his co-stars are not lacking in the acting department. Keanu Reeves is notorious for being as wooden as a fence post, but his performance here won't help that argument. Reeves is great here. He uses subtlety in his performance, but he displays a larger range of emotion than in many of his other movies. Charlize Theron also gives a great performance, showing that she's a force to be reckoned with. A lesser capable actress could have gone way over the top, but Theron uses restraint. Craig T. Nelson is probably the weakest member of the ensemble, but that's okay; his character is rather minor and he doesn't have much screen time (that said, he provides solid support).This is a movie of ideas, and it has some good ones. Not quite a horror flick, but that's not what it's trying to go for. It's more of a drama/thriller, but it's always engaging and never boring. And Al Pacino is great to watch, as always.",8,1,2,22 March 2008
The Mask," Irreverent fun!
","If anything, 'The Mask' could best be described as a cartoon for adults. Yes, it's a live-action film, but there's enough animation to sufficiently blur the lines between animation and live action, and the film's spirit is pure cartoonish.Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a mild-mannered bank accountant manager who's always treated like doormat, even by his friend Charlie (Richard Jeni). One night, Stanley finds a mysterious mask which when put on, unleashes his complete alter-ego, known simply as 'The Mask.' But the mask is not bound by laws (legal or otherwise, which gets Stanley into trouble, both with the law (represented by the cynical Kellaway (Peter Riegert)) and the mob (Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene)).This film is all about Carrey. While his first major foray into film, 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,' allowed him to perform his antics, 'The Mask' is a better vehicle. This is because it allows computer animation to supplement Carrey's abilities. Plus, 'The Mask' allows Carrey more creativity.Fortunately, Carrey is up to the task. Like Robin Williams, he's skilled at impersonation and animated personalities. Carrey has great fun lampooning everything to circus sideshows to the Oscars. But Carey spends only about half the movie (at most) as The Mask. As Ipkiss, he's more subdued and meek. But Carrey is equally adept at portraying someone like Ipkiss. It is Carrey's versatile skill that lets 'The Mask' be a caricature, while Ipkiss be very real.Carrey's co-stars are great as well. This represented Cameron Diaz's film debut, and it kicked off her career with a great start as the knockout club singer, Tina Carlyle (doesn't the name just SOUND beautiful?). There are few actresses with more screen appeal than Diaz, and 'The Mask' makes as much out of it as possible. The other female, Amy Yasbeck is frumpier, but appealing as well. Despite Diaz having a huge aptitude for comedy, she isn't given much of a chance to use it here; Yasbeck is. Yasbeck has a great sense of comic timing.Carrey's male co-stars are more varied, albeit slightly. Peter Riegert is terrific as The Mask's nemesis, Detective Kellaway. It's a familiar part in this sort of movie, the no-nonsense cop with no sense of humor. But Riegert has a few advantages: first, the law is REALLY on his side, and his banter with his dimwit partner Detective Doyle (Jim Doughan) represent some of the comic highlights. The late Richard Jeni shines as Ipkiss's friend and co-worker, Charlie. While Jeni doesn't steal any scenes (he's almost always paired with Carrey),y he has his shares of funny lines, all of which are delivered aplomb. As the villain Dorian Tyrell, Peter Greene is adequate, but not especially memorable. He's not even the best villain in the movie. That honor goes to Ricardo Matecena. He's only in two scenes, but he's noticeably more menacing than Greene, especially in his first scene.'The Mask' represents director Chuck Russell's most memorable hit. This is because while he has a knack for visuals, his direction in other respects is bland. He works best when he makes scenes as set-pieces. Two of the best examples are the musical numbers, the first being a surprise dance number of 'Hey, Pachuco!' with The Mask and Tina, and the second is a rendition of 'Cuban Pete' between The Mask and the Police Department. They're both energetic and fun.While 'The Mask' may not be the pinnacle of the genre, it's definitely worth a watch. Though I never saw it in theaters, I'm guessing it works better on video than it did in the theater.",7,0,0,26 April 2009
Angels & Demons," Same grade as 'DaVinci Code,' but different strengths and weaknesses
","It has long been known that the prequel to the literary sensation 'The DaVinci Code' would be rewritten as a sequel to the 2006 film. Other than a few token lines of dialogue referencing the first film, it really doesn't matter (not that there are many people who haven't read the book OR seen the movie). While the two films are very similar in style and plot, the films have different strengths and weaknesses.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is the renowned Harvard symbologist who prevented the destruction of the Holy Grail in the previous film. After the previous events, Langdon is obviously not high on the Vatican's list of well-liked individuals. Nevertheless, he's the only one who can help them when four cardinals who are favored for the papacy have been kidnapped, and a bomb is hidden somewhere in Vatican city that could completely destroy the city. Making matters even more desperate is the fact that because the Vatican is nominating a new pope, all the cardinals are there.This is not an actor's movie. The film moves too fast for anyone to really 'act.' Still, none of the actor's blow it. Tom Hanks essays the same character that he did in the first film, and the other major players, Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl do what is required of them. The newcomers, Ayelet Zurer, Thure Lindhart, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Klass, and David Pasquesi do the same. No one here is going to be up for any awards, but that's not the point. This is all story and nothing else.Ron Howard must be a director that reads reviews of his movies. Unlike 'The DaVinci Code,' which, upon first viewing, failed to generate the momentum that the novel had, 'Angels and Demons' does something that the first film didn't: generate legitimate tension. That's not saying that 'The DaVinci Code' film was boring, it's just that this one contains moments of actual suspense (even if you have read the novel beforehand, like me).That is actually part of the problem. The film moves so fast, it's hard to generate any feeling for the characters, and Robert Langdon isn't really the one who's in any danger (well, sort of. Up until the end, the film concentrates on solving the most immediate of crises on the way to the big one).'Angels and Demons' is also plagued by some technical problems. The lighting in the film is terrible. It's so dark that we can't appreciate all the majesty of the inside of the churches. Is there no legitimate light in all of Vatican City, or does everyone there just like to do everything in the dark? I don't think it's the latter. On second thought, why don't we just say that the film's cinematography as a whole is terrible, because when indoors, the camera does not make use of the large space. And even though the art is a huge part of the film, we never really get a good look at the artwork.I'm at a loss to explain why the critical reception of the film was so vicious. It's by no means perfect, but 'bad' is certainly not a word I'd use to describe Ron Howard's new film. Even 'mediocre' is too cruel. Do I recommend it? Sure, but the film moves so fast that I'd suggest reading the book first.",7,1,2,22 May 2009
Changeling," A thoroughly absorbing mystery
","There's no more gripping mystery than a missing child case. Just take a look at the tabloids, who reported the disappearance of little Caylee Anthony for months. If it is a gripping drama for outside viewers, imagine what it must be like for the parents of a missing child. That's what Clint Eastwood's harrowing film, 'Changeling,' gives us. This is an unforgettable film.Los Angeles, 1928. Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) leaves for work. When she gets home, her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) isn't there. She calls the police, but to no avail. But after months of searching, her son is found. However, the boy returned is not Walter. The police don't believe her, and do everything to make her go away. Help arrives with the Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb (John Malkovich), who has long been denouncing the corruption in the LAPD.'Changeling' has a brilliant story, and director Clint Eastwood wisely focuses on that. Therefore, I find it rather odd that Angelina Jolie walked off with an Oscar nod for her performance. Don't get me wrong, Jolie's performance is amazing, but I think her Oscar recognition was more due to the fact that it would have gotten a lot more viewers if Hollywood's Most Beautiful Couple (Jolie and Brad Pitt) were nominated in the same year. Then again, I guess some recognition has to go to Jolie for being able to pull off a meek disposition in front of the cameras.Jolie is helped by a number of solid supporting performances. John Malkovich is surprisingly good, playing against type as Briegleb. If someone were to tell me about the character, Malkovich, having made a career out of playing creeps and psychos, is the last person I would have picked. But Malkovich holds his own. Jeffrey Donovan is PERFECTLY cast as the corrupt police officer, Captain J. J. Jones. If there's anyone who can put on an instantaneous fake smile, it's Donovan. That, and he is so good at being so thoroughly unlikable. Jason Butler Harner is chilling as Gordon Stewart Northcutt, bearing a very strong similarity (in both his looks and his performance) to Cillian Murphy. Michael Kelly is warmly low-key as Detective Lester Ybarra, the first cop who is willing to publicly believe Christine. Colm Feore, looking more gaunt than ever, is also effective as the corrupt Chief of Police.Special mention has to go to the cinematography and the costume design. The color is desaturated, but in an artful kind of way. It looks like a magazine ad, and the effect is amazing. The costume design is spot-on. Everyone looks just like they did in the 20's. If the story weren't so engaging (which it is), 'Changeling' would be watchable just because of how it looks.I've lost confidence in Clint Eastwood's direction after the vastly over-rated 'Million Dollar Baby.' But with 'Changeling,' Eastwood proves that he's not afraid to take a chance with his films. And he has the skills to pull it off.Rent 'Changeling.' It's better than most of the so-called mysteries out there. It's tremendously involving, and unlike most 'thrillers,' it's never predictable. That's more than can be said for many films.",8,1,2,27 June 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," See it twice-first for the shock, next for the laughs
","I saw this movie once a few weeks ago. I laughed, but I felt ugly doing so. After that I disliked it. Then I was persuaded to see it again, and maybe it was that I knew what I was going into, but whatever the case was, I loved it! It's hilarious! Be warned, this is only for the open-minded and not the overly-sensitive. This will have something that offends everybody, but as long as you can take it in stride, you'll have a grand old time! After this, I am definitely eager to check out Da Ali G show! This is what an independent film is supposed to be! All gamble and nothing held back, and not quirky and depressing like 'The Royal Tenenbaums' or any other tragicomedy.",10,0,4,28 November 2006
The Hangover," Very Funny
","We've all been there. There have been nights where we've drank too much and can't remember everything. For Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galfianakis), this happens on the bachelor party for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). Unfortunately, the morning after, they realize that they lost Doug.The humor in 'The Hangover' comes from the bizarre situations that the characters find themselves in. Or more specifically, that they got themselves into the night before, and are just now remembering it. This type of humor can work, although a film that completely relies on it (like this one) runs the risk of making the material get dry and tired. Fortunately, director Todd Philips keeps things brief enough and the pace quick enough that this doesn't really become a problem.It's hard to address the acting, because the actors play very familiar types (this is the film's biggest problem). Bradley Cooper is no stranger to playing a jerk (he got his big break in 'Wedding Crashers,' although he's more sympathetic here). Ed Helms, while not being a stranger to comedy, is not a well known name. He's the worrywart who turns into a doormat whenever his over-bearing girlfriend is mentioned. Zach Galifianakis is the black sheep of the group, who's only along because he's going to be Doug's brother-in-law. Nevertheless, the comedy works because all of the principal cast members have a sizable amount of comic aptitude.Not everything works (the movie feels underdeveloped--with a little more care, it could have been a masterpiece), but most of it does, and there are some very big laughs to be found throughout the 100 minute running time (the end credits alone are worth the price of a few admission tickets).'The Hangover' is comedy pure and simple. Nothing is understated, and it's not quirky. It's just plain funny.",8,2,6,20 June 2009
Minority Report," A tense and absorbing thriller
","Movies are only effective if they involve the viewer; we can't enjoy someone's story if we don't care about what happens to them. In general, the best way to do this (at least for a mainstream movie) is to present a strong story. Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, 'Minority Report' is a tense thriller that poses a number of intriguing ethical questions.Welcome to the era of PreCrime: a world without murder. Three special people, known as the PreCogs, are about to predict murders before they happen. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) works for the PreCrime division, and is passionate that it works. But when the PreCogs predict that he is going to commit a murder, Anderton has to find out why before he is caught.If you could see into the future, does that mean that what you saw is really going to happen? Can someone change their mind at the last minute? Is it right to arrest someone for a crime that they were going to commit, but hadn't done it yet? These questions lie at the heart of 'Minority Report,' and fortunately they are not mentioned then disregarded; the whole storyline revolves around answering them.Despite his bizarre off-screen antics, Tom Cruise is a good actor. This is certainly one of his best performances. Anderton is a man who uses this opportunity to battle personal demons, although it only partly works. He is deeply troubled by his past, and that conflict makes Anderton an almost tragic figure. Cruise plays the part perfectly, and we never stop rooting for him. Colin Farrell is effective in his breakout role as Danny Witwer, the agent from the Judicial System who begins snooping around PreCrime, perhaps to take over John's job. Max von Sydow brings a deep note of class to the film as PreCrime's director, and John's mentor, Lamar Burgess. It's an effective performance, and for a man who could easily play an elderly man, von Sydow is certainly an arresting figure. Samantha Morton has the most difficult part as Agatha, one of the PreCogs. She's bizarre, acting as if she's on some sort of a drug. But Morton allows us to peek beneath to see her lucidity. Kathryn Morris, the always wonderful Lois Smith, and Mike Binder are good in bit parts, while Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare steal scenes in terrifically loopy performances.This is Steven Spielberg's best film since 'Saving Private Ryan.' He keeps the pace up, and shows us that he's still a director, and not just a name on a marquee. Spielberg has a vivid imagination and brings everything to life. This is a science fiction film, but it is grounded in reality enough that it is plausible that everything that happens in this film could be real in the near future. The film is well-paced and put together; it's a complex plot, and deals with some serious ethical questions, but it's never confusing. Special note goes to his music selection. Spielberg mixes some classical music into the film very effectively, and the soundtrack by John Williams represents some of his best work.The only problem I have with the film is that in one scene, it breaks the rules the film functions by for its own convenience. That being said, most people won't notice (or care).Note: while the action sequences are pretty standard stuff (albeit well-shot and choreographed), the flashbacks of murders are pretty graphic. This really pushes the boundaries of PG-13.",9,0,1,28 November 2009
Erin Brockovich," John Grisham with an attitude
","In general, legal films are either grand courtroom dramas or films about how the system has failed someone, or how it has been construed to bypass justice (which, I guess, is the same thing). 'Erin Brockovich' is neither. Instead, it's about a woman who uses her personality to accomplish what many people with legal degrees cannot, and in the process, dealing a record-breaking blow to a company who cut corners and left many people very sick.Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is in a deep rut. A former beauty queen, she is nearly penniless after two failed marriages that left her with three kids, and she's unemployed. After she demands a job from an attorney named Ed Masry (Albert Finney), she uncovers a huge corporate crime almost by accident, and it turns out to be a lot bigger than she or Ed ever expected.Julia Roberts is the perfect choice to play the title character. Roberts has made a career out of playing sunny and extroverted characters, and that quality suits her well. Erin doesn't know anything about the legal system, but she has amazing people skills, and ultimately that's what really makes the case work. The people of Hinckley don't trust the lawyers, but they trust Erin. For lack of a better analogy, she's the Moses guiding the people to the promised land.However, Roberts has more range than she is often allowed to show. Working on the case takes a heavy toll on Erin's family life, and we see her pain from being away from her family. Some of these scenes are heartbreaking.The supporting cast members are great as well. Albert Finney is great as Ed Masry. He's got the brains, and knows he's in over his head, but he knows that attempting to fight with Erin about taking the case is utterly pointless. They may not like each other at times, but the two make a good team. Aaron Eckhart is also good as George, Erin's boyfriend. He's the voice of reason for Erin. However, while he loves Erin, he's not going to be a doormat. There's one performance that has been overlooked, but is nonetheless effective: Scotty Leavenworth is great as Matthew, Erin's son. It is through him that we see the effect that the case has on her family, and Leavenworth perfectly illustrates that. There's no sense of artifice in his performance.'Erin Brockovich' is filled with bit performances, and all are excellent. Hinckley's inhabitants are extremely sympathetic, and we only want the best for them. PG&E, the evil corporation, is represented by some of the nastiest people ever. They wouldn't bat an eye to the plight of Hinckly's population if they hadn't sued. They thing that the plaintiffs are worthless, and that because they are poor, they don't matter. The viewer's hatred for the greedy corporation is instantaneous. However, the film is all Roberts.2000 was a great year for Steven Sodebergh. He came out with two hit movies ('Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic') that took the Oscars by storm. Both earned Best Picture and Best Director nominations (he won for the latter film). His skill as a director is clearly evident (he hasn't done work this good before or since). The cinematography is desert-like: bright and grainy. Hinckley is not a happy place, but the people are nice.Although 'Erin Brockovich' deals with some heavy material and contains some powerful moments, that should lead one to think that this is a depressing movie. On the contrary, there are many amusing moments, and two scenes that are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Sodebergh finds the right balance between drama and comedy (although calling the film a comedy is not necessarily truthful).There are a few flaws, but overall, 'Erin Brockovich' is a wonderful film.",8,0,1,21 July 2009
Mulan," Great Disney movie, but not up there with the best
","During the 1990's, it seemed that every year or so The Walt Disney Company would come out with a new animated masterpiece. After the breathtaking 'The Lion King' in 1995, the quality of the films decreased, with 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' 'Hercules,' and, their worst feature (although 'worst' is a relative term), 'Pocahantas.' With 'Mulan,' that trend was reversed (though the legacy of hand-drawn animation came to an end with the dawning of Pixar), at least temporarily (I haven't seen 'Home on the Range,' though it bombed at the box-office, ending the legacy).While 'Mulan' may have reversed the trend, it fails to match up with Disney's undisputed masterpieces. That being said, it comes close. The animation is astonishing (though the human figures are not as beautifully rendered as in 'Beauty and the Beast'). It features a number of standout songs, and a few hilarious sequences. The voice characterizations are solid, with Disney making the right decision to use voices that work the best, and not those who are the most famous. The villain is vicious, but doesn't top 'Aladdin's' Jafar. In short, 'Mulan' is very good, but not the best.During Imperial China, the villainous Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army of Huns has crossed the Great Wall of China and is moving towards the Forbidden City, destroying everything in their path. The Emperor (Pat Morita) orders that one man from every family must serve in the army against Shan-Yu. This poses a problem for the Fa family. They don't have any sons, which leaves the ailing patriarch, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) to serve. However, his daughter Mulan (Ming-Na/Lea Salonga) knows that he cannot fight, so she poses as a boy and goes in his place.'Mulan' covers a lot of issues, none of which are taken TOO seriously: cross-dressing (how neither the MPAA nor the social conservatives have a fit about this being in a family movie is beyond me), honor (not quite taken to a stereotype), feminism, conscription, the nature of identity, and so on. Nevertheless, neither the script nor the directors have any intention of pushing some sort of agenda with these ideas. The only reason why any of these issues are addressed is to tell the story, and that's why this film succeeds.Of all the Disney heroines, Mulan may be the most three-dimensional. She's not the first girl not to be lady-like (that would be Belle from 'Beauty and the Beast'), but she has the most depth. Mulan is more of a tomboy than anything, and that makes her a very interesting character. This is taken seriously (she will be executed if she is caught), and it's also taken for laughs (whenever she tries to act 'manly,' and a disastrous encounter with the Matchmaker (Miriam Margolyes), which is nothing short of hilarious).The other character that has to be mentioned is Mushu, who is voiced by Eddie Murhpy. A failed guardian, Mushu is demoted to waking up the ancestors and the guardians. After a catastrophe, Mushu finds himself in a peculiar position: if he succeeds in getting Mulan home safely, he may be able to become a guardian again. Internet film critic James Berardinelli likened Mushu to Robin Williams' Genie in 'Aladdin.' While I see the resemblance, I prefer the Genie to Mushu, if only because Williams improvised his lines to better effect. Still, Murphy does great work, and he has a number of hilarious one-liners.There are other great smaller characters as well. The wordless cricket has some great scenes with other characters. The tiny but outrageous Grandmother Fa (June Foray/Marni Nixon) has some hysterical scenes as well. And the three soldiers who become Mulan's friends, Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo), and Yao (Harvey Fierstien) serve as more comic relief.'Mulan' has some problems. Some of the dialogue could have been rewritten, and the difference between Mulan's speaking voice and her singing voice is immediately noticeable. Most noticeable of all is the rather plain look of the people. Disney has a way of drawing the human figures to fit the culture it is portraying (like in 'Hercules' and 'Pocahantas'). 'Mulan' is no different, but more work should have gone into them.As it is, though, 'Mulan' is a lot of fun for both kids and adults.",7,0,1,22 May 2009
Se7en," Dark and Provocative Thriller
","In 'Seven,' it's always raining. Some parts take place in daylight, but the world is dark, gloomy, and decrepit. And this makes for a dark and disturbing thriller.Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is trying to finish up his last week before he retires. To that end, he shows his replacement, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). But before introductions are over, they are facing a brilliant killer with a diabolical plan.David Fincher is known for his visually arresting and atmospheric films, and 'Seven' is no different. This is a film that is drenched in atmosphere and menace. From the first frame, it is clear that this will not be a happy movie, but one filled with violence and menace. But for all the effort that goes into the film's look, it's not that involving. And that is the film's biggest problem. 'Seven' is still a good film, containing many moments of genuine suspense, and it's always engaging.In murder mysteries, the protagonists are usually stock characters, leaving the only real acting to the villain. Not so here. Mills and Somerset are clearly different, and Pitt and Freeman are up to the task of making them seem different. Somerset is quiet, reflective and patient. Mills is the exact opposite: arrogant, hyper and quick to action. He only wants the answers, but not the context to understand the kind of person he's pursuing. Gwyneth Paltrow is largely wasted, but she makes full use of what she's given.Many thrillers have unexpected plot twists, and 'Seven' is no different. DO NOT, under ANY circumstances, allow anyone to reveal the last 20 minutes to you. The film's ending is one of the greatest twist endings in film history.'Seven' is a unique thriller, and a pretty good one at that. But it could have been a lot more.",8,0,0,9 August 2009
Star Trek," A solid 'reboot' of the iconic franchise
","To say that 'Star Trek' is a cult phenomenon is an understatement of galactical proportions (ha ha, this time the pun is intended!). The fans of the famous series are the butt of jokes from every fabric of our culture (not only do they have a collective name, Trekkies, but TWO documentaries about them!). Their only rival in fan fever that they have is 'Star Wars,' though I think many of them belong to both parties.For a long time now, old TV shows have been resurrected on the big screen. Not quite a remake, but a new 'version'. But ever since the massive success of Christopher Nolan's new vision of the 'Batman' franchise, the term 'reboot' is the correct lingo. So how does J. J. Abram's 'reboot' of the 'Star Trek' franchise measure up? Well, it's not Nolan's re-envisioning, although to compare any 'reboot' to those films is unfair to just about any movie. Abram's film is a solid start to an inevitable franchise.Oh, there are flaws. Most of them are little things, like music carrying over when it shouldn't, mildly awkward cuts, and the like. But there are three BIG problems, which I will get to later.This is an 'origin' story, and it feels like one. What makes this different is that it tells one story with one villain, as opposed to propelling the development of the characters through episodic chunks. This direction runs the risk of rushing the development or not adequately doing so, but 'Star Trek' avoids doing this.James Tiberius Kirk is a rebellious young man who has accepted his lot in a life of meaningless existence. However, he is challenged by a Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to join up with the space fleet. Of course, Kirk does this, but he seems more concerned with pursuing women than really working hard. This puts him at odds with Spock (Zachary Quinto), whose Vulcan side makes him a strict adherer to rules and protocol. Nevertheless, they are eventually put together on the U. S. S. Enterprise when they run into a nasty Romulan named Nero (Eric Bana), who has a nasty habit of turning planets into black holes. Now, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew have to save Pike (who was captured by Nero) and defeat Nero while not getting destroyed (or destroying each other, in the case of Kirk and Spock) in the process.This is very long winded, but it's relatively straightforward. At least until they insert time-travel into the story. Normally the sci-fi mumbo-jumbo is just frosting on the cake. Not here; it's an intergral part of the story, and I spent a frustrated 10 minutes trying to figure it out.The performances are where 'Star Trek' really shines, and that's probably the most important part of the film. In order to sustain a franchise (which 'Star Trek' will undoubtedly become, given the fact that every movie that makes even a dollar more than its cost gets at least two sequels), we have to like the characters and they have to be able to hold the audience's attention. Abram's cast does this, in a way that's actually better than expected.Everyone gives it their all. Chris Pine is great as the rebellious, somewhat cocky role as Kirk. He's a guy you can root for. The main characters in movies are typically the most grounded, and therefore the least interesting. But Pine injects Kirk with enough personality that he's never dull. Zachary Quinto steals the movie as Spock. He turns what is a one-dimensional character (a rule-abiding nerd) into a fully three-dimensional character. While Kirk may be the 'hero' of the movie, it's Spock that we really feel for. Qunito ably conveys Spock's internal conflict between his emotionless-Vulcan side, and his human side, which is anything but. Quinto, of 'Heroes' and '24' fame (neither of which I have seen), is an actor to watch. Eric Bana is completely unrecognizable as Nero; he's vicious and a more than worthy adversary to the Enterprise crew, but he's not going to go replace science-fiction's most iconic villain, Darth Vader. Other actors, including Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, and in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo, Winona Ryder, dive into their roles just as fully. Leonard Nimoy brings a wise presence in what is much more than glorified cameo.Apart from the time-travel confusion, there are other problems. 'Star Trek' gets off to a bad start. The problem is that it immediately dives into the story. While there's certainly no crime in getting to the meat of the story quickly, it is essential to have at least some development with the characters. Given the way it turns out, it's not such a big problem here, but even spending a minute or two with the characters would have made it more effective.The second is the lack of character development. Apart from Kirk, Spock, and to an extent, Nero, no one is even remotely fleshed out. But with a cast this big, it's probably unfair to expect more than the film gives. I guess we'll have to wait for future installments to get to know the secondary characters more.Is 'Star Trek' worth seeing? I liked it. Will the most die-hard fans like it? Not being one myself, I can't say. But I'd say they should give it a shot (if they haven't already). Will it turn me into a Trekkie? Doubtful; I'm not running to Best Buy to buy every season of every show, though I might watch it when it's on TV. Best of all, it's a much needed antidote to the superhero movies, which I have long since tired of.Note: I saw this at 10:15 on the second day of its release. The theater was dark, but from what I could see, there didn't appear to be anyone dressed up as one of the characters. Make of that what you will.",7,2,10,9 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Not Tarantino's best, but I'll take it
","Quentin Tarantino took the early 90's by storm with two unforgettable masterpieces of cinema: 'Resevoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction.' I haven't seen 'Jackie Brown' or 'Grindhouse' but the 'Kill Bill' movies were far below his pedestal. With 'Inglorious Basterds,' QT is back, although it's still a shade below his best.Like his other features, 'Inglorious Basterds tells many stories at once. First is that of the film's namesake, a group of American soldiers told to hunt and kill Nazi soldiers and take their scalps. The point of this is to just raise hell and spread terror throughout the Third Reich. The second story is that of Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), who escapes slaughter at the hands of Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Once in Paris, she runs a movie theater, and fate has it that she will get a chance for revenge.People have been saying that this is QT's most cinematic film, and that's true. 'Inglorious Basterds' is probably QT's most accessible movie, but it's still QT. Of his films, this is probably the most straightforward, and the most 'normal' (if it were possible to call anything by QT normal). It's still got the same flavor of his earlier films, but it's easier to digest.Like in his previous films, QT lets his actors stretch their range considerably and he allows them to play parts that they are not known for. Brad Pitt may be the tabloid king, but he's a good actor. He let everyone know that he's still got talent with his Oscar-nominated performance in 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,' and Pitt continues the trend. Aldo Raine is probably the most demented character QT has ever come up with, and Pitt relishes it. He's obviously having a grand time playing the scenery chewing (or is that scalping?) lieutenant, and he's a joy to watch. As good (and famous) as Pitt is, he's not the one getting all the attention. The one everyone is talking about is Christoph Waltz, and there's a reason for it: he's awesome. Waltz is positively delicious as the sadistically gleeful Landa. He may a kidder, but he's smart, and sly as a fox. Nothing gets past him, and this leads to some tense moments. It's hard to say who's more fun to watch, Pitt or Waltz, but the multi-lingual Landa is a more developed character. Waltz deserves all the accolades that he's getting, and a shoo-in for a Best Supporting Actor nod. However, the two women of the film, Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, are largely ignored. Both give terrific performances. Laurent is great as the revenge-driven Shosanna. She's intense, but able to keep composure. She's also able to fend off the advances of the Nazi war hero, Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) with wit and bite. Diane Kruger has been labeled a foreign sexpot, which I find unfair. Hopefully people will recognize her talent as the German actress-turned-spy. Also starring is Eli Roth, who, at least in this case, is proving to be a better actor than director.With a story like this, QT ran the risk of not doing justice to, or worse, exploiting, the Nazi persecution of the Jews. But QT treats the material with enough sensitivity that he avoids this problem. There is no shame in enjoying this film for what it is: a bizarrely twisted and funny WWII movie.The only thing that holds this film back is the script. It's not that it's bad, but QT's first two films had brilliant dialogue, and that's missing here. QT spent years developing this film, but unfortunately, the script doesn't show it.Nevertheless, this is a wildly entertaining ride. Welcome back, QT.",9,0,4,13 January 2010
Amistad," Messy, but still powerful
","Forgive me for what is now a cliché, but many people say 'Amistad' is to 'Schindler's List' as 'The Lost World' is to 'Jurassic Park.' That's an apt comparison, although 'Amistad' is closer to a misfire than 'The Lost World' is.A ship carrying slaves from Africa (via Cuba) suffers an uprising from its captives, and the slaves force the surviving crew members to return them to Africa. But they are betrayed, and sent to America, where they are captured. Two abolitionists, Ted Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and Tappin (Stellan Skarsgard), hire a property lawyer, William Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) to set them free, as (based on a technicality), they were illegally acquired 'property.' But tensions between the North and the South on the slavery issue are brewing, and President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) is pressured into intervening on behalf of the Southern states. What was once a simple case quickly becomes a fight for freedom.Ask anyone who the greatest filmmaker who ever lived was, and many will have Steven Spielberg on their lists at some point. However, while it is true that Spielberg is one of the masters, he is not flawless. He takes a few major missteps with the film, and what could have been a worthy successor to 'Schindler's List' is now just another credit on his resume.To begin with, the first hour of 'Amistad' is messy. There are a lot of things going on during this time, and Spielberg can't keep it all straight. It is navigable for the viewer, but many will be left slightly frustrated as I was. The film gets better after this, but the problems don't stop there. While many films of this ilk use manipulation (i.e. powerful music and dramatic shots) to convey the right emotion in the viewer, the best films are very subtle about it. During some spots in 'Amistad,' Spielberg's manipulation is obvious. Sometimes he even adds elements to the film that don't really have a place there. Finally, there are some technical issues (like how it is so easy for the crew members of La Amistad to understand the prisoners while it takes a long time for the Americans to become able to do so).Spielberg's films are typically known for their strong performances (there are exceptions, however), and 'Amistad' is no different. Matthew McConaughey has a very narrow range, but like many actors, he can be effective in the right type of role. As Baldwin, McConaughey is effective, but not standout. He does what is required of him, and not much more. At times, Spielberg seems to want to make Baldwin like Oskar Schindler (both men view their quarry (slaves/Jews) as a means to an end, but they gradually begin to care about them and their fate). However, McConaughey does not have the talent that Liam Neeson has, nor is the character developed enough. Freeman and Skaarsgard are important during the first half (both give solid performances), but are largely forgotten (Skaarsgard disappears from the screen before halfway without much explanation.However, 'Amistad' boasts two standout performances: Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams, and Djimon Hounsou as Cinque. Adams is a far-cry from Hopkins' most infamous performance (Hannibal Lector), but Hopkins devours the role (in fact, it's almost impossible to believe that the two characters are portrayed by the same man); his Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Adams is a frail man, but he has great energy, and is an outstanding orator. His 11-minute speech before the Supreme Court is completely arresting.Djimon Hounsou has tremendous screen presence. He can command a viewer's attention like no one else I have ever seen; his scenes where he lets loose his fury about his situation are almost frightening. Yet Hounsou is also effective at playing a subdued character, which he does from time to time. Cinque is the beating heart of the story; everything else just revolves around him. Hounsou makes his mark on the film, and his performance is unforgettable (an Oscar nod for his performance was well warranted).When 'Amistad' came out on video, I was about ten. I remember running from the room screaming and crying, and was unable to finish watching the film. Like 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Amistad' contains some very heavy and disturbing material. Although not as pervasive as Spielberg's second WWII epic, there are at least two scenes that will likely provoke a similar response.'Amistad' is an okay film, as long as you don't compare it to 'Schindler's List.' Or 'Jurassic Park,' for that matter.",7,0,1,13 July 2009
The Notebook," Hate to admit it, but I love this movie
","Let me be upfront and say that I am a guy. This is not my kind of movie. I don't do sudsy melodramas, which this most definitely is. I don't like chick flicks either, which this also is. I don't care if this is a well made movie. Doesn't matter. End of story.Okay, fine. I liked this movie. A lot. It may be one of the most manipulative good movies out there, but if it works, who cares? This is plain and simply a wonderful movie.Based on the Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, 'The Notebook' tells two stories. One is of a summer fling between mill worker Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and rich girl Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams). The other is of an elderly man named Duke (James Garner) who is reading this story to a present day Allie (Gena Rowlands, mother of director Nick Cassevetes). But how are these two stories connected.The answer is of course fairly obvious, and the movie wisely doesn't try to hide that fact. The film's real focus is the romance between Noah and Allie, and everything that comes between them.The film works because of the strong performances and the equally strong direction. To say that Ryan Gosling is an unconventional leading man in this kind of a film is an understatement. Gosling burst onto the film scene in a riveting performance as a Jewish neo-nazi in 'The Believer,' and went on to play two other creeps and killers before landing this role. Gosling stays true to form and does not approach the role in a conventional way. He's not a model and doesn't pretend to be, but his subtle free spirit energy works, and makes him quite literally impossible not to like. Rachel McAdams is equal to him. She's a rich girl that spurns off his random advances, but Noah doesn't stop, and when she finally humors him, she realizes that, gosh darn it, she actually likes the guy.Gosling and McAdams are supported by a strong cast of noted character actors. James Garner couldn't possibly be more endearing, willing to give up everything to be with Allie, who is slipping further and further into dementia. Likewise, Gena Rowlands is terrific as the elderly Allie, who is revisiting this story for the first time. Joan Allen is wonderfully wicked as Allie's conservative mother, who is trying to keep Allie from seeing Noah. It's a clichéd role, but Allen imbues it with so much life that the character becomes just as three-dimensional as everyone else. James Marsden is surprisingly good as Allie's new lover, rich boy Lon Hammond. Unlike many romantic complications, he's actually likable (in fact, one could make the argument that he's more likable than Noah at times). Marsden's range is quite limited, but this is his best performance. Sam Shepard is also on hand in a small role as Noah's father, but it's a good performance nonetheless.Nick Cassevetes has done the impossible: he's made a weeper that will appeal to those who don't prefer to watch movies with a tissue at hand. He does this by taking the melodrama as far as it can go without going overboard, and by establishing a nostalgic tone for the film. Watching the movie is like watching old home movies and revisiting fond memories of the past. The film is photographed by Robert Fraisse, who gives each beautiful shot its dreamy tone.Sometimes guys must be dragged by their girlfriends to see romance movies. Although they may put up a fight to see this one, they will probably like it as much as I did (whether they will admit it is open to question).",8,0,1,23 July 2010
Elizabeth," Stunning historical drama
","Some movies will be remembered for their legacies. 'Elizabeth' is such a film; it brought one of the finest modern day actresses to the world's attention. Inexplicably she didn't win an Oscar for her electrifying performance here, and time has shown that mistake to be one of the biggest blunders in the history of the Oscars (once again calling into question the dubious publicity campaigns of Harvey Weinstein...). Nevertheless, while the film is good enough in its own right, the lasting legacy of this film is the debut performance of Cate Blanchett.England, mid-1500s. Henry VIII is dead, his daughter Mary has no heir, and Protestants are being burned at the stake by the Catholics. However, the power of the Catholics comes to an end, however, with the crowning of Mary's Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth. Just because she is queen doesn't guarantee her safety, however.The film is a showcase of stellar acting and spectacular visuals. We are literally transported back to regal Europe and the journey is arresting. It wouldn't be possible without some stellar performances.Cate Blanchett is dynamite as the eponymous character. She is so good that even 12 years later, it is unthinkable that she lost the Oscar for her performance (to 'Shakespeare in Love?' PLEASE!). She's a lightning rod, and sets herself up as a talent to match Meryl Streep, a challenge which she has continuously met again and again. It may have been her breakout performance, but she is so comfortable on the center stage that you'd never in a million years believe that it was her first shot at the big time.Blanchett is helped by a number of other stellar performances. Geoffrey Rush is delicious as the shadowy Walsingham. He's like a spider, spinning his web from the dark corners of the room, pulling his strings so that events are silently manipulated under his control. Christopher Eccelston is excellent as the unspeakably evil Duke of Norfolk. Cinema hasn't seen a villain this vicious in a long while. Joseph Fiennes surprised everyone into thinking he could act as Robert Dudley, Elizabeth's lover (history has proved this to be a fluke, rather than the rule). Richard Attenborough is solid as Elizabeth's desperate adviser, Sir William Cecil. Terence Rigby is frightening as Bishop Gardiner, the Catholic bishop who is calling for Elizabeth's assassination. Brief appearances by Fanny Ardant, Vincent Cassel (in an purposefully over-the-top performance), John Gielgud, Emily Mortimer, an unrecognizable James Frain, and Daniel Craig (who has one of the most frightening scenes in the history of film) are all solid.Director Shekhar Kapur has an eye for period detail and directing actors. His storytelling abilities, however, leave something to be desired. The machinations of the twisty plot can be confusing, although the film is never boring, and it always retains a generous level of coherence.Be warned about venturing into this movie, however. This is a very violent film, and the way it is made makes the bloodshed (of which there is plenty) shocking, brutal, and highly disturbing. I have never seen violence in a film that is more unsettling than in 'Elizabeth.''Elizabeth' is a good film, but it will always be remembered for introducing audiences to one of cinema's brightest stars.My Rating: Rated R for Strong, Explicit Graphic Violence, Disturbing Images, and Some Brief Sexuality.",8,1,2,19 March 2010
Black Book," Terrific!
","World War II covers so much ground that it is impossible to tell every story that happened during that period. Despite being one of the bloodiest and most destructive periods in human history, it has provided the world with many captivating stories, ranging from 'Schindler's List' to 'The Pianist.' Now joining that list is Paul Verhoeven's 'Black Book.'Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) is a young Jewish singer who is the only survivor after a botched escape attempt that killed her family. Now she works for the Resistance in Holland (under the name Ellis de Vries), and becomes embroiled in a scheme that that leaves her wanted by both the Nazis AND the Resistance.There are two names that stand out in this movie: Verhoeven and van Houten. Their work is outstanding in this picture, and while everything about this film is superbly done, they are the ones to remember.Paul Verhoeven is adept at drawing the most out of his movies, whether it be the good ('Black Book') or the bad ('Starship Troopers'). I'm willing to forgive him for the latter film (not much can be done when you have Casper van Dien in the lead), especially when he makes movies like 'Black Book.' Like in probably his most famous movie, 'Basic Instinct,' he gives us another terrific female lead, Carice van Houten.Carice van Houten is a force to be reckoned with here. She's smart, tough when she has to be, but she still shows a lot of vulnerability. van Houten gives it all in her performance (in more ways than one). This is an outstanding performance, and I am anxious to see what her career holds for her.The other actors are great as well. Sebastian Koch is solid as Ellis's lover, who manages to get our sympathy despite who he is. Waldermar Kobus is despicable as Franken, who is always fearsome and loathing. Halina Reijn is great as the ditzy, oversexed Ronnie. The weakest is Thom Hoffman (looking strikingly similar to Edward Burns), who despite not being bad, can't command the attention that his fellow actors do.If there is anything to complain about, and there isn't much, it's with the ending. It's not what happens, it's how Verhoeven handles it. The final explanation is pretty confusing, even after a second viewing. Also, the actors seem to switch languages at random times, though all of it is spoken flawlessly (which is in and of itself a problem, however slight).Still, this is a great movie. Highly recommended! This is a great movie, and Verhoeven's best.",8,2,7,8 July 2008
"I Love You, Man"," Gut bustingly funny and actually endearing
","When I first heard about this movie, I became a little irritated. The premise seemed to me like a 'romantic comedy for gays' except with a few lines to make it a 'bromance.' It makes sense, as most guys in the target age group (high schoolers and college aged) are quite uncomfortable discussing sexual orientation in any context (Don't believe me? Try raising the topic with your best buddies). It seemed like it was wimping out instead of taking a chance and really making a movie that could make said guys comfortable about this sort of thing.This may be the film's intention, but it hides it well. The romance between Peter (Paul Rudd) and Zooey (Rashida Jones) is well-integrated and quite important to the story. If anything, it represents a major stepping stone.I approached this film with much trepidation; I don't especially like Judd Apatow movies. Some of the stuff is funny, but a lot of it is too understated, like Clark Duke in 'Sex Drive' or 'Kick Ass' (watch the trailers of either one of those movies and when the dorky kid with glasses talks, you'll see what I mean). Worse, Jason Segel wrote and starred in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' a movie of that ilk that I didn't like at all. Fortunately, none of those characteristics made into this movie. The jokes flow naturally and the film has energy and chemistry between the actors. This result is 90+ minutes of absolute hilarity.Peter (Paul Rudd) has always been a ladies man. Women love him, and he finds them very easy to talk to. That's one of the reasons why Zooey (Rashida Jones) falls head over heels for him, and when he proposes, she accepts. But once wedding plans get underway, he realizes that he has no best guy friends to make up his share of the wedding party. So with his friends encouragement, he sets out to find a new best guy friend. After a few disastrous 'man dates,' he runs into Sydney (Jason Segel), a fun loving guy with a lot of advice on how to break loose and have fun.The best thing about this movie is that everything unfolds naturally. True, it follows the familiar beats of the genre, but nothing that happens is contrived. The characters actions are genuine and make sense from what we know about them, and that makes it more honest (not to mention effective.The leads are great. Paul Rudd tones down the 'funny smartass' personality that made him famous and instead acts like a likable guy, albeit without male/male social skills and a penchant for creating bad nicknames and catchphrases. Peter is an easy guy to like, and he has good chemistry with both of his co-stars, Rashida Jones and Jason Segel. Segel is a revelation. He's one of the most likable characters I've seen on screen in a long time. He's easy going and earnest, the type of guy anyone would want as a best friend. However, some of his philosophies on life and social skills come off as scripted, and try as he might, Segel isn't able to make them sound otherwise. Rashida Jones is also very good (looking and sounding like Jessica Alba, only more relaxed). When Peter tells her about Sydney, she's excited for him. If us guys could all have such wives, we'd be in heaven. As the gay brother who is on hand to give advice about 'man dating,' Andy Samberg is far less irritating and obnoxious than he was in the utterly awful 'Hot Rod,' which is near the top of my list of one of the worst movies ever made.John Hamburg is making a comedy, and like the best ones, he lets everything flow naturally. The humor isn't kept on mute, or drained of energy, or kept low-key. It's totally natural, and that's what makes this such a funny, and dare I say it, touching, comedy. I was actually discussing this film with my best guy friend, and the movie reminded us quite strongly of the sort of things we would do when we were in college together. Movies that have establish that kind of a connection with a viewer don't come along very often.",9,21,31,22 June 2010
Hot Fuzz," Good, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing
","Let me start off by saying that British comedy is not my thing. On the whole, I don't care for Monty Python, and I didn't care for 'A Fish Called Wanda' (though I loved 'Death at a Funeral'). And that's what 'Hot Fuzz' is: a British comedy.Nicholas Angel takes being a policeman very seriously (meaning he's obsessed with it). But he's so good that his superiors transfer him to a little village in the middle of nowhere. Of course, he's a fish out of water there, as no one there gives a damn. But when he starts shaking things up, some startling 'accidents' arise...Even if you're not a fan of British comedy, there's plenty of material worth a couple of grins, though not enough to warrant a viewing. One of the strange things about 'Hot Fuzz' is that even though it's clearly a satire, Simon Pegg makes Nicholas Angel into a fully three-dimensional character. Satires exist for the sole purpose of poking fun at character types, which the film does, but Angel is someone who displays a full range of emotion. That makes him more interesting, and dare I say it, sympathetic.Other name actors are on hand to add to the fun. Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, and in a one scene cameo, an unrecognizable Cate Blanchett (she's hidden in a biomedical suit). Nick Frost is Angel's dimwitted sidekick, who shows him the ropes, and again, he's a character we begin to care about as well.As I'm not a fan of this type of humor, I can't really judge how well it succeeds. But director Edgar Wright knows what he's doing, except when it comes to the action sequences. The constantly moving camera isn't successful, and gets pretty annoying.Still, I guess it warrants a viewing if you're into this sort of thing.",6,1,3,17 January 2009
The Mummy," A grand and immensely fun adventure!
","Strictly speaking, this is not a remake. Although I haven't seen the original, I highly doubt that a movie made in the early 1930's could have this kind of action and adventure. Apparently it shares a similar plot-line to the Boris Karloff classic, but unlike many remakes, or 'reboots,' this one is entertaining enough in its own right.The film opens in Ancient Egypt, where a priest named Imohtep (Arnold Vosloo) is caught in a love affair with the pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez). He and his priests are executed and the priest is cursed. Cut to the 1930's, where an adventurer named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is about to be executed. He is saved by a ditsy Egyptologist named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) because he knows the location of a lost city where rumors of untold treasure await. While there, they of course end up awaking Imohtep, and with him come a few nasty side effects to the curse.The best part about this movie is that it plays manages to chill us and make us laugh. There are some genuinely freaky moments, and there are also some openly funny bits. Not many movies can make that claim. Even better is the general adventurous spirit that the movie is filled with. It's just a grand old adventure! The acting is great. Brendan Fraser is a likable rogue who can fire a gun no problem but, as he puts it, 'I bet with my life, not my money.' His unlikely companion is a klutzy librarian who loves Egypt dearly (her mother was Egyptian), and Rachel Weisz is terrific in her star-making part. Likewise, John Hannah is hilarious as her dim-witted, treasure loving brother, Jonathan. You can almost see the jewels in his eyes every time the word 'treasure' is mentioned. Oded Fehr plays the part of the native who knows all about Imhotep with a mix of 'adventure sidekick cliché' and a serious character; it works. Despite being in only two scenes, Eric Avari steals them as Evie's boss who plays a unique roles in the proceedings. The only cast member who really doesn't work is Kevin J. O'Connor. As the cowardice, traitorous Benny, his character works, but O'Connor's shrill and croaky voice is extremely annoying. Surprisingly, O'Connor has been in nearly every movie with writer/director Stephen Sommors, so I guess Sommers finds something appealing about him.Stephen Sommers knows just what to do with his material. He clearly did not take offense to critics trashing his previous movie, 'Deep Rising,' a reaction that I found unfair. Luckily, studios didn't either. Sommers brings his knack for action and goofy humor to this movie, and its more effectively used here.Other than O'Connor's annoying performance, 'The Mummy' suffers from a few problems. There are a few continuity issues here and there, and if one takes this movie too seriously, they will realize that the story makes itself up as it goes along. Nevertheless, it's goofy charm will prevent most people from realizing them.Great art, this is not. Nor is it a classic like Indiana Jones. But it's still pretty entertaining.",7,0,0,21 December 2009
Dead Poets Society," Extraordinary
","Inspirational films run the risk of being boring and preachy, but 'Dead Poet's Society,' an under-appreciated near-masterpiece, is neither. A great script, superb performances and excellent direction make 'Dead Poet's Society' a truly amazing film.The film takes place at Welton Academy, a prestigious boarding school for boys that prides itself on tradition. Enter John Keating (Robin Williams), a passionate poetry teacher who encourages his students to 'make their lives extraordinary.' With his unconventional teaching methods, Keating inspires his students to break out of the molds that their school is putting them into, and become individualsfor better or worse.The acting in this film is nothing short of incredible. Robin Williams gives his best performance as Keating. Williams was born to play this role, plain and simple. He plays the role with so much passion that it is impossible not to become inspired ourselves. If every teacher were as good as John Keating, then I would have become a Nobel Prize winner by the time I reached college. Although this is not a comedy, the role does give Williams the chance to earn a few grins and chuckles (watch for the scene where he talks about Shakespeare). The young actors who play the students are no less compelling. Robert Sean Leonard is terrific as Neil Perry, a young man with his future already planned out for him by his domineering father. But Keating gives him the chance to break out and discover who he really is, but the threat of his father's anger always clouds over him. Leonard ably portrays the sense of a young man trapped in a life that he begins to realize is not what he wants. Leonard should have received at least some recognition for his performance. Ethan Hawke is also very good as the incredibly shy new student, Todd Anderson. Everyone knows a kid like Todd, who is so insecure that he has trouble speaking up in class. Hawke is so good that we can't help but feel for the guy. Josh Charles and Gale Hansen are quite funny as Knox, the guy who is lovelorn for a girl at the local public school, and Charlie, the rich troublemaker.However, there is an actor that is often overlooked, and that's a shame. Kurtwood Smith is outstanding as Neil's father. The talented character actor is actually rather frightening as the overbearing father. Yet Smith never lets the character become a 'villain,' so to speak. He wants what's best for his son, and he gave everything to get Neil into Welton, but he can't understand that Neil may not want the life that is set out for him. Smith should have gotten an Oscar for his performance, though he was not nominated.Peter Weir has established the perfect tone for the film. It's not the witty comedy that the trailers make it out to be (although there are some funny moments, including a hilarious scene involving a telephone), nor is it a manipulative tearjerker. This is a character exploration about a few young men who are breaking out of the norm and learning what life is really about, and who they really are. However, Weir makes one blunder, and it's a big one. The film's climax is superbly constructed (the sense of foreboding is quite potent and disturbing), but when the big moment comes, he makes a huge mistake by using slow-motion. It only lasts a few seconds, but it's so over-the-top that it shatters everything that the previous few minutes have built up. The film recovers as soon as the clip is over, however, primarily because our character identification is so strong.This is a truly amazing film, and I cannot express that enough. I love this movie with all my heart.",9,1,2,22 April 2010
Brokeback Mountain," A groundbreaking and important film
","Homosexuality has been depicted in films for ages, but typically it is used as a subplot or a buried secret. This is especially true of mainstream films (before 'Brokeback Mountain,' no film in wide release dealt openly about homosexuality). Ang Lee's courageous film finally brings homosexuality out into the open. With it, it brings to light the fears and feelings that many people face, but most don't know or understand.Ennis del Mar (the late great Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet in the summer of 1963 working as sheep herders for Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid). But the more time they spend together, the more they realize that a mutual attraction is growing between them. Both recognize the love that they feel for each other, but this is 1963, and such a relationship can have consequences. They agree that this was a one time thing, but staying away from each other is harder than they think.For a film that is intended to break new ground and open a lot of doors for discussion, it has to be good. And 'Brokeback Mountain' is excellent.The performances are superb. Without a doubt, the beating heart of the film is the romance between Ennis and Jack, and Ledger and Gyllenhaal are more than up to the task. Ennis is the central character. He knows what he feels, but his fears and need to keep a level of normalcy keeps him from acting on it. Ledger is nothing short of incredible in his performance. I haven't seen 'Capote,' but quite honestly, Philip Seymour Hoffman must have been REALLY good to steal the Best Actor Oscar from Ledger (interesting note: some claimed that Ledger had more work to do, as he created a lot of Ennis's qualities from nothing, while Hoffman merely mimicked Capote). Ledger creates a truly memorable character that everyone (straight, gay, bi, in the closet) can identify with. Jake Gyllenhaal matches Ledger beat for beat. Like Ennis, Jack is a little confused by his feelings, but unlike Ennis, he is not tortured by fear and insecurity. He knows what he wants, and is content to get it; his only obstacle is to convince Ennis to join him.The female actresses are just as good, although their roles are strictly supporting. Michelle Williams is solid, although her Oscar nod was a little surprising; her part is pretty small and her development is stunted to make room for the Jack/Ennis romance. Williams plays Alma, Ennis' wife. She loves her husband, but she wonders why Ennis never comes back from his fishing trips with any fish, even though she asked him. In my opinion, Anne Hathaway should have gotten her first Oscar nod here. She instantly sheds off her Disney past as Lureen, Jack's self-absorbed wife. Lureen is so caught up in her own life that she doesn't even begin to notice anything strange going on about her husband's frequent trips up north. Linda Cardellini is excellent as Cassie, the waitress who falls for Ennis. But he's so conflicted by his own feelings that he alienates not only her, but everyone else. Anna Faris is unrecognizable as Lureen's chatterbox friend.Ang Lee is hailed as one of the greatest modern filmmakers around, and rightly so. He has created two masterpieces, and his other works are not far behind. If you look at his resume, you'll notice that none of his films are in any way related to each other. Lee has tremendous versatility, and he refuses to be confined to one type of genre, which I highly value. Although Lee got his long overdue Oscar for 'Brokeback Mountain,' this is neither his best film nor his best directing. Lee has been known for his subtlety, and while that often works in his films, it doesn't quite make the mark here. We understand the emotions that the characters are feeling, but the film is so subtle that we can barely feel them, if at all. Part of the reason is that he brings every scene out equally. The main story is the Jack/Ennis relationship. But Lee brings the other scenes out to the same level, and while they work on their own, one scene's effectiveness comes at the cost of the other.Four years after the release of the film, it is obvious that 'Brokeback Mountain's' goals have been achieved. It opened a lot of doors for discussion, and it was widely seen. But did it get to the people that really needed to see it? One of the problems in our society today in terms of LGBT rights is the stigma attached to homosexuality. The stereotype of gay men as being effeminate or 'emo' is everywhere, and I think that really hampers the acceptance of it by some men. 'Brokeback Mountain' addresses this social stigma in a way that should be enlightening. So if you think that being gay is not 'manly,' see it. It will change your perception of gay men. As for those who are turned off by it being a romance, I'd like to quote Richard Roeper (though in a different context): Get over it. Yes, it's a romance, but sappy, it is not. This is not 'The Notebook,' nor 'Titanic,' despite the associations with it. Besides, it's 2.5 hours. What have you got to lose? There is no doubt that this was the most talked about film of 2005. After viewing the film, I think this is based not so much on quality, but because of what it means to society. Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful film. But it's not perfect. Being socially liberal, I was disappointed at its loss to 'Crash.' After viewing the film twice, I have to admit that 'Crash' is an overall better film. But in all honesty, no one is really going to remember 'Crash' in a few years. However, they will remember 'Brokeback Mountain' because of its importance. And really, that's all that matters.",10,1,3,12 December 2009
Orphan," Creepy thriller
","For those of you that like thrillers like 'Single White Female,' 'Fatal Attraction,' or 'Audition,' this is another shocker in the same vein. Although 'Orphan' has some genuine thrills and scares, it made me feel a little unclean at times.When 'Orphan' begins, we meet the Colemans: Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Saargard), and their children Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Max (Arayana Engineer). After the stillborn death of their third child, Kate and John decide to adopt one. At the orphanage, they become enchanted with a little girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). At first, she appears the child from heaven: she immediately bonds with Max, and learning sign language to communicate with her (Max is deaf). But strange things start happening around Esther...This is what 'The Good Son' could have been, had it been better written and acted. Yet, even though it rectifies the main fault I had with that movie (nothing the psychotic Macauley Culkin character did was really evil enough), that comes at a price. Children (specifically Esther) act violently in this film, and at times it crosses the line between suspense-building and unsettling. While I'll agree that having a child commit this crimes gives the film an extra punch, some (though not all) of the scenes left me feeling dirty and violated.Still, all in all, this is an impressive thriller. The most important part of a thriller is a good villain, and Esther is truly frightening. At age 12, Isabelle Fuhrman has quite the capability to scare the living hell out of anyone. She's right up there with Jennifer Jason Leigh and Eihi Shiina, or more applicably, Jacob Kogan from 'Joshua,' which coincidentally also starred Vera Farmiga. The other cast members acquit themselves well too. Vera Farmiga is in top-form as Kate, though she's been here before (in fact, she plays almost the exact same character as she did in 'Joshua'). Peter Saarsgard, a talented actor from the independent film circuit, plays a type, but he does solid work. However, the script calls for him to be dumber than is realistically plausible, and Saarsgard can't make us believe that his character is really that oblivious. The child actors are great as well. Jimmy Bennett is solid in an unspectacular part of Daniel. He's not really excited to have a new sister, and his friends make fun of him for how Esther acts. But Arayana Engineer is perfect as Max. She's adorable, and although very young, Engineer draws our sympathy like a magnet. We never stop rooting for her.Apart from the amorality of some of the scenes, not everything that director Jaume Collet-Serra does works. He attempts to create scares where they have no place, and the failures of these elicited laughs from the audience. Speaking of laughs, there is a bit of humor in the film, and that works. However, one of the scenes is so over-the-top that it's unintentionally hilarious.I recommend it, if you've got a thick skin for this sort of thing.",8,2,3,5 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," A good follow-up
","When I heard that the new Terminator movie was rated PG-13 in stead of R like the rest of them, I lost faith in it (changing the rating for a sequel never works...remember the Whole Ten Yards? Or the Fantastic Four sequel?). Then I remembered how corrupt the MPAA is, especially when it comes to big budget action movies, so my hopes rose. The truth is that Terminator Salvation is really no more violent than the last two films (once again calling into question the dubious practices of the MPAA. If you're worried about the sequel being 'neutered' to allow the teenage audience to see it, fear not. You'll get what you paid for.That being said, 'Terminator Salvation' is a good film despite the lower rating. There are moments of sheer suspense and a good few jump moments. That, and the story is actually pretty engaging. And, the acting is solid across the board as well.Unlike the previous features in the 'Terminator' franchise, 'Terminator Salvation' takes place strictly in the future, after Judgement Day. The world has plunged into darkness and humanity is losing the war against the machines. John Connor (Christian Bale) is the head of the resistance, as the previous films foreshadowed. But there is another character that comes into play. That is Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), an amnesiac who carries a dark secret that could change everything.As promised, 'Terminator Salvation' is darker and grittier than any of the previous installments. However, this is no 'Saving Private Ryan.' Director McG's goal is to create excitement in the audience, and the tone exists only to give the story an extra visceral punch. The visuals are desaturated to the point where everything is almost gray, yet again, 'depressing' is not a word that anyone would use to describe the film.The acting is solid across the board. Christian Bale gives a terrific intensity to John Connor, and while unlike either Edward Furlong or Nick Stahl, his performance works (I suppose anyone would act different in a post-apocalyptic war as opposed to the early 90's or 2000's). Newcomer Sam Worthington is clearly a hopeful A-lister to producers (he's already in James Cameron's upcoming sci-fi epic 'Avatar'), and if he keeps up the work that he does here, I'll be willing to bet that the producers' gamble will pay off. He very nearly steals the movie from Bale (though his character is more central to the story than Bale's). Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard (even though her talents are wasted here), Anton Yelchin, Michael Ironside, and, in what could charitably be called a cameo, Helena Bonham Carter, are solid as well.The film's structure is similar to the previous films, but there are a few noticeable differences. Primarily, the film tells two stories at the same time: John Connor's and Marcus Wright's. Marcus's story is more compelling, and at least for the first hour, that's who the focus is on (Bale doesn't appear much during this time). These stories converge and intersect from time to time. They also shift focus between characters as the story requires. In another movie, this may seem like a flaw, but at least here, it works.Despite the perceived limitations, I enjoyed this film, and I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the franchise.",7,3,5,29 May 2009
Juno," Know what you're getting into before you see this movie
","'Juno' represents one of the tragically few instances where big-budget Hollywood is forced to realize that they are no longer king of the film industry. This is an independent film through and through, and it's major, perhaps unexpected, box office success proves that something different does not always mean death for the movie.Actually, it's success is quite surprising. 'Juno' is a good film, but I've seen better. It's being marketed as a comedy, and while it certainly has it's moments of humor, it's actually more of a drama.Juno MacGuff (a solid Ellen Page, who deservedly got an Oscar nod) is a very independent teenager who decides to 'go all the way' with her best friend Paulie Bleeker (the terrifically lovable Michael Cera), and she winds up pregnant. After a bad experience at an abortion clinic, she decides to have the baby, and give it up for adoption, and finds a willing couple (Jennifer Garner, who's a little flat, and Jason Bateman, who is great, though even with his subtle character manipulation, he still seems similar to everything else he's played) in the classifieds.Though the story focuses on Juno's pregnancy, at the same time it is also about Juno's coming of age (so to speak), and, more specifically, her romance with Paulie Bleeker. Kudos to Diablo Cody (who won an Oscar for her script), and director (who was nominated for a directing Oscar) for dealing with all of this in an intelligent and logical way. There's no superficial melodrama here, unlike some of the big-budget Hollywood productions that deal with teenage issues. Cody and Reitman know how teenage romance works, and they also know what it's like to be in love ('Casablanca' this is not), and they develop this with a lot of tenderness and care, and it makes us really care about the people involved.The film is marketed as a smart, razor-sharp comedy, but it's more of a light-hearted drama with a few laughs. The parents (the wonderful J.K. Simmons, whose performance arguably deserved an Oscar nod as well, and the slightly over-the-top and underdeveloped Allison Janney) are made to look like the greatest parents in the world since they are okay with Juno getting pregnant. Actually, it's slightly different. They're not happy about it, but they accept it and deal with the situation the best they can.Knowing what you're going into is important in some movies, because if you expect something other than what you get, a person may have worse feelings than the film probably deserves (which is why I feel that marketing should depict what the movie is really like, instead of what will get most people into the theaters-it may not seem like it will get the most money, but chances are that the viewer will be happier with it and the film will get stronger word-of-mouth). This is what happened to me, so I was a little more easy-going on the grade (though I think that the 6 out of 10 is appropriate). It's still well-worth watching, and not as much of a downer as the subject matter usually has. Then again, it's not as fun as some would have you believe.",6,1,6,29 May 2008
Match Point," Outstanding!
","'The man who said I'd rather be lucky than good saw deeply into life.'Those words, spoken in the opening narration, are the premise for Woody Allen's powerful thriller 'Match Point.' Everything that happens in the film is based on luck, whether good or bad, and how the characters respond to it.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a retired tennis pro who gets a job teaching tennis at a posh country club in London. There he meets rich kid Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), and they become fast friends. Chris falls for Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), but then he meets Tom's fiancée, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson), and an affair begins.To say more would be unfair, but let's leave it at saying that Allen knows what our expectations are, and plays them against us.'Match Point' demands patience, and for the first hour, is rather slow moving. However, this allows us to intimately know the characters. But more importantly, it allows Allen to pull us in without us really noticing. Allen sets the stage early, but he turns the wheels ever so slightly, so that by the time the film really gets going, we're completely hooked without realizing that Allen was drawing us into his web.The acting is the most crucial part of the film. Woody Allen creates complete, three-dimensional characters on paper, but it's up to the actors to bring them to life. Fortunately, Allen has gathered a first-rate cast that is more than up to the task. Scarlett Johannson continues to impress as the seductive but unstable Nola. Nola could have been a one note plot contrivance, but with Johannson's performance (helped along by Allen's brilliant script), Nola is refreshingly real. Emily Mortimer is one of the most underrated actresses living today, but thankfully her performance in 'Match Point' changed that. Chloe is an optimist who is completely in love with Chris, but she is completely oblivious to her husband's extracurricular activities. Matthew Goode shines as the immensely likable, but unintentionally snobbish Tom. It's no surprise that Chris would take a liking to him. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton offer solid supporting turns as well, though their characters are strictly supplementary.But this film belongs to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. He got his break playing the soccer coach in the international hit 'Bend It Like Beckham,' but here he is allowed to display his true range, and his performance is superb. He may not be present in every scene, but the whole film revolves around him and the decisions he makes; some of them are beyond his control, but others determine the course of events. This is a man who is held hostage by the decisions he makes, and desperately tries to find a way out from the unforeseen consequences. It is always a risky endeavor to have a single actor to carry the film, but Rhys-Meyers is more than up to the task. It is appalling that his work was unrecognized by any of the major awards.This is the first Woody Allen film I've seen. Apparently, Allen is known for his comedies, but if anything, 'Match Point' proves that when it comes to film-making, Allen has considerable versatility. His script is brilliant, and his direction is not far behind. He is a master of developing characters, but some of the scenes are cut a little too abruptly. However, these are small blemishes on an otherwise superb production.'Match Point' demands a lot from the viewer. But if you're willing to give it a chance, it will not disappoint.",10,2,4,16 May 2009
Milk," Sean Penn in the performance of a lifetime
","While there are many outstanding actors and actresses out there who give brilliant performances, we often see them as an actor portraying (however well) a character. It is the mark of a truly gifted actor to see them only as their character, and not as an actor portraying them. While this is a difficult feat for an unknown actor to accomplish, it is much more so for a well-known actor because everyone knows their face from their past roles.The reason why I bring this up is so I can truly explain how good Sean Penn is in 'Milk.' Penn completely inhabits the character's shoes, and even though Penn's face is well-known, we only see Harvey Milk on-screen, not Sean Penn portraying Harvey Milk. Penn's second Oscar was well deserved. Sean Penn is an electrifying actor, but this is his best performance. In fact, this is one of the best performances by an actor that I have ever seen.'Milk' details the life and times of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official. Save for a little background, the film concentrates solely on Milk's political career, one that was cut too short by an assassination by Dan White, who was a fellow supervisor (up until a few days before the murders).The film focuses on the character of Harvey Milk, and through this exploration, we follow him through his career. The story of Milk's campaigning and occupation as the supervisor is not shortchanged, but the film is about the man. Milk was more of an activist than a politician. He never did things by the book. He saw what needed to be done, and he did it. He knew how to attract attention to his cause, and he took advantage of that repeatedly. Strangely, though, Milk became as much of a politician as anyone else, although he still worked in the same fashion.Penn is surrounded by a number of capable actors: James Franco, Diego Luna, Emile Hirsch, Josh Brolin, Alison Pill. All give solid performances, but all of them fade into the background against Penn. Josh Brolin was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Dan White. While Brolin is always credible, he seems a little too restrained. Of the bunch, newcomer Alison Pill fares the best. It's a bit part, but Pill is very good as the lesbian Anne Kronenberg. Milk has the passion, but Anne has the smarts for getting his ideas to work.'Milk' requires that the viewer pay attention. Dustin Lance Black's Oscar-winning script is dense, and it is very possible for a person to miss something if they are not paying attention. That being said, this is no 'Michael Clayton:' you don't have to be a Rhodes Scholar to understand it.Gus Van Sant has never been a director to play it safe. Van Sant does what he wants, and even in his 'mainstream' efforts, he could care less about what is commercially accessible. If it works, he'll use it. When it works, it's brilliant. First and most noticeably is his use of archive footage in the film. This is a tremendously effective approach to the work, and the technique is very well done; often times it is difficult to tell what is archive footage and what is not.One thing I especially liked about 'Milk' is how it doesn't see its characters as stereotypes. Gays are not presented as effeminate or socially awkward. They are normal people and for once, Hollywood had the sense to not reinforce stereotypes.Unfortunately, there are too many little problems here and there that prevent me from giving this film a 10. It's the little things, like one scene is slightly confusing, a certain transition doesn't work, and so on. The ending is meant to be very powerful and dramatic, but the film needed more focus on the story of Harvey Milk's career for that to have been as effective as Van Sant surely wanted it to be.Still, 'Milk' is highly recommended. Gay, straight, bisexual, homophobic or not, 'Milk' is highly recommended.",8,1,4,19 June 2009
Cloverfield," Near brilliant
","Man, what a rush! 'Cloverfield' is, in short, a wild ride.I'm not going to go into the story at all because there isn't much more to the story than everyone knows. It's not that kind of a movie.What it is, however, is near brilliant. Not everything works (almost everything does though), but all in all, it's well worth the admission price.The decision to make it using a hand held camera was genius. It really puts you into the middle of the chaos, and makes the need for richly-developed characters not needed. Plus it intensifies everything by about 100 times. Some will complain that this makes the film have a dizzying effect, but except in a few spots, that's not really an issue.The best part of the movie is the dialogue and the acting. For the most part, particularly in the beginning, the film feels almost unscripted. The people say things and talk almost exactly like real people do, and the actors supplement that quality by acting like real people, and not like movie characters. Again, this heightens the movie's immediacy and realism, and avoids making this movie having an intelligence level of zero.In any review of this movie, there is going to be some mention of 9/11. This is as unavoidable as it is necessary to discuss. In a few spots, it brings back unsettling memories of that tragedy. I can't fault the filmmakers for this because since the event was so traumatic, it was probably unavoidable. Or maybe it was intentional. If so, it works.This is a summer action movie without a doubt. Why the producers decided to release this in January is quite obvious. This time of year is a bridge between Oscar-movies and movies that would cost less to flop than to shelve. Since this is a radically new approach (one that has never been tried with a big-budget action movie-at least for the whole film), the producers probably didn't want their whole summer resting on the shoulders of something they weren't confident would work. Releasing 'Cloverfield' at this time would cover two bases: if it was a huge, unexpected success, it could be up for some Oscars (as it looks now, that is highly unlikely except for the awards that typically go to action movies, since the Golden Globes are typically good indicators of the Oscar nominees). However, if the movie flopped, it would disappear along with the rest of the post-Oscar trash without so much as a blip on the radar screen.I really hope this movie does well. Given how stingy mainstream movie producers are with new ideas, they probably won't try this approach unless it makes big (and I mean BIG) bucks. That would be a shame, because when used appropriately, the use of a hand-held camera can be very effective. However, it is a little early for the post-Oscar garbage (that usually comes in February), so there is a definite threat that it might get lost in the Oscar racing movies. Should this happen, mainstream movie producers would probably assume that this movie was rotten as a whole, thus ending the careers of the approach as well as the actors (which would be horrible, since all are great, especially Michael Stahl-David, who is excellent). Only time will tell what the future holds for this kind of movie.",8,12,25,18 January 2008
Alien," 'In space, no one can hear you scream...' but they can in your living room!
","Superficially, 'Alien' is just like a slasher movie. A group of people are gathered some place for one reason or another, and are picked off one by one by some deadly foe. But there are a number of differences that separate this science fiction horror classic from your average slasher movie: an unbearably intense atmosphere and what is easily the most frightening creature ever to grace the silver screen.A group of workers on a space mining ship Nostromo get a strange signal from a nearby planet. When they go out to investigate, something strange happens...Of course, after over thirty years, it's probably safe to assume that anyone who is on the Internet Movie Database and reading one of the thousands of reviews of this classic has seen this movie, but because I don't feel that I have to go into any more detail, I won't. That being said, if you are reading this and actually HAVEN'T seen this movie, go and see it...primarily because you're going to get a classic freakout that few, if any movies can give you, but also because it's almost a sin for any movie lover to live with the fact that they haven't seen this movie.This is more akin to movies like 'Halloween' than 'Star Wars' (two VERY different movies that came out within a year of each other), so like the John Carpenter classic, the acting rules that govern films like 'Star Wars' or 'The Godfather' do not apply. Nevertheless, it introduces us to the most famous action heroine, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver. She's effective in the role, but there's no time or need for her to do anything else. Likewise, better known character actors Tom Skeritt, Ian Holm and John Hurt do the same. Lesser known actors Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and Yaphet Kotto stay in their league. What's especially nice is that each individual is unique (though not three dimensional), which is something of a rarity in these kinds of movies.There are two names that are responsible for most of the film's successes: H.R. Geiger and especially director Ridley Scott. Geiger, whose night terrors provided the inspiration for the Alien, deserves much credit. There is no other being that I can imagine that is more frightening than the Alien in this film. It's large, slimy, and extremely deadly.But while Geiger created the creature, it was up to director Ridley Scott to create the atmosphere in which its potential for terror could be reached. And does he ever get us there! Scott's sense of atmosphere is impeccable. His use of long shots where characters appear small is extremely effective in getting us on edge. There are moments where we believe that something can jump out at us at any time, which is not an easy feat to accomplish. Some of the early scenes also recall something out of a horror film from the silent era; Hell was coined for scenes like these.There is a reason why this film is hailed as a classic: it's dark, tense, and scary as hell!Rated R for Monster Violence/Gore, Terror and Language.",9,0,1,21 May 2010
Shutter Island," A great thriller
","Martin Scorcese's movies have always placed character above plot. Lately, however, Scorcese has been leaning towards a reversal of this. That's not to say that his talent for film-making has diminished as a result, far from it in fact (in my opinion, it says more about the decreasing taste for subtlety and serious drama in American cinema and the surge of talentless tabloid gurus, but never mind...). Scorcese is still one of the greatest filmmakers around, even when he's not making a movie that's a part of his forte. And 'Shutter Island' is about as far away from a 'typical Scorcese film' as you can get.Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been called to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner at Ashecliffe, a mental institution for the country's most dangerous criminals. But once he arrives, he realizes that there might be more to the island than he initially realized...This doesn't sound like the type of movie Martin Scorcese would make, and it isn't. 'Shutter Island' is all story, and it's exceptionally well told. The atmosphere is thick and dark, and there are some scenes that are genuinely creepy. Both in style and content, calling 'Shutter Island' a horror film wouldn't be too far off base.'Shutter Island' has something that no other Scorcese picture has: inventive visuals. I'm not talking about papers falling in a room like snow (although that scene is pretty cool). But just looking at the setting is visually arresting, recalling such films as 'Dark City' or 'The Crow.' The film is top heavy with stars, and all of them are at the top of their game. DiCaprio, Scorcese's latest muse, doesn't have the most challenging part, but he makes it work. We feel for Teddy, and most importantly, we are with him every step of the way (mentally and emotionally). Mark Ruffalo is amiable as his new partner, Chuck Aule. Ben Kinglsey is deliciously creepy as the head of the facility, although not as creepy as Max von Sydow, the mysterious head doctor. Patricia Clarkson, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, Elias Koteas and Jackie Earle Haley are in top form in brief, but very important performances.Dennis Lehane's novels always have a morality question at the heart of their stories, and while the one in 'Shutter Island' isn't groundbreaking, it's asked in a compelling way. The same thing applies to the ending; it's been done before, but Scorcese leaves the answer ambiguous (however there are some questions and continuity issues in the film that should be resolved but aren't), and all the while you're asking yourself if you're going to be right about the ending.

Fargo," A Black Comedy/Thriller from The Coen Brothers...Need I say more?
","Going into a Coen brothers movie expecting something traditional is ridiculous by any stretch of the imagination. Any movie directed by the Coens is going to be severely warped in one way or another, either by approach ('No Country for Old Men') or by their sense of humor (everything else).By all accounts, 'Fargo' is a murder mystery, though it is anything but straightforward. This is not 'Law & Order.' It's about a simple crime that spiraled way out of control for all the principal characters. That's understandable, since everyone populating this story is either hopelessly inept or hopelessly stupid.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who needs money to open a new car lot. But since he thinks that the only person who could give the money to him, his father-in-law (Harve Presnell), won't put down the money, he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife (Kristen Rudrud) and split the ransom that his father-in-law will pay. Unfortunately for Jerry, the two thugs he hired don't have any brain cells between them, and Jerry is probably the most incompetent criminal the world has ever seen. Things get out of hand very quickly and the bodies start piling up. This draws the attention of the very pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).It may seem like I've given a lot away, but really, I haven't. That's just the set-up for a series of unexpected (not to mention bizarre) twist and turns that the Coens throw at us. Many thrillers, even the best ones, have easily projected paths. 'Fargo' is anything but.Despite IMDb listing it as such, merely calling 'Fargo' a crime/thriller is an insufficient description. The film is as much a comedy as anything else. From the character's stupidity or complete ineptitude, to the funny accents and way of speaking that everyone has, the Coens never take 'Fargo' too seriously.The acting is the best part of the film. Frances McDormand is a real scene-stealer, and in many ways the best part of the movie. Marge is relentlessly chirpy and optimistic, and she's easily the smartest character in the film (although that's not exactly saying much). 'Fargo' really takes off whenever she's on screen. William H. Macy gives his best performance as Jerry. As reprehensible as his plan is, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy. He's so bad at being a criminal, it's really pathetic. But seeing him try to get out of the jams he gets himself into are nothing short of hilarious. Steve Buscemi and Harve Presnell are good as the brainless kidnappers, and even though they think they're smart, they're really, REALLY dumb.Joel Coen has a knack for twisting the story just enough so that it's funny without lampooning the genre. This isn't a satire, but the jabs it takes almost make it so. It has its share of violence, including a scene that in any other movie would be completely sick and disturbing, but as told by the Coens, it's so shocking and absurd that it's laugh-out-loud hilarious.Roger Ebert heaped tons of praise on 'Fargo,' saying that 'Movies like 'Fargo' are the reasons why I love movies.' While I greatly enjoyed 'Fargo,' I can't heap that much praise on it. Some of the cuts in the film are too long, and I half-expected a commercial break. Additionally, there's one scene where Marge reunites with a guy from high school that, while funny and irreverent, really doesn't add anything to the story. Still, it's enjoyable enough that it's hardly worth complaining about.While it may not be perfect, 'Fargo' is still a very good film, especially if you have a warped sense of humor.",10,7,10,26 April 2009
American Pie," An Outrageously Funny Comedy
","Sex by itself is not funny. Nor is anything else, for that matter. The key to comedy is appropriately setting up and executing the jokes. Fortunately, 'American Pie' has all the requisite elements.Four best friends, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have a problem: They are seniors approaching graduation, and they still haven't gotten laid. Their egos are hurting, but when the biggest geek, Sherman (Chris Owen) gets laid before they do, they decide enough is enough. The four make a pact: each of them will have sex before the Senior Prom.The key to this kind of comedy is pushing boundaries. 'How did they get away with this?' will enter anyone's mind at more than a few points in the movie (the prudish MPAA notwithstanding). All the characters are curious about sex, but they don't know how to respond to it without looking like geeks. This kind of awkwardness is good mining territory for comedy, and the creators of 'American Pie' exploit it for all it's worth. The result is a riotously funny comedy that will have even the most tightly-wound doubled over in laughter for much of the time.But what really elevates 'American Pie' from the usual raunchfests (other than its funnier than most of what Hollywood shells out), is that we actually begin to care about the characters in the film. None of them are especially well-developed (this is an ensemble comedy), but they are likable and more importantly, surprisingly real. We recognize Jim's infatuation with the Nadia, the sexpot foreign exchange student. We understand how awkward Oz feels talking to a girl completely different from him for the first time (Mena Suvari). We empathize with both Kevin's fears and uncertainties, and those of his girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid). And strange as it may seem, we can see a bit of ourselves in Finch's refined taste.The acting is actually very good. Jason Biggs has the social awkwardness down pat, and quite frankly, no one shows complete and utter embarrassment like him. Thomas Ian Nicholas is good as Kevin, although he is rather flat in his 'big moment' speeches. That shouldn't be entirely faulted on him though, the dialogue in these scenes isn't especially well written. Chris Klein is rather flat as Oz, the jock. He's not bad, it's just that Oz could have used a little more energy. Eddie Kaye Thomas is great as the tightly wound Finch.The girls are great too. Shannon Elizabeth is wonderful as the sexpot, especially because she knows the effect she has on Jim. Tara Reid is good as the girlfriend who wants everything to be perfect when she loses her virginity. Mena Suvari is especially good as the mature good-girl who, despite everything, falls for the jock. And Natasha Lyonne is terrific as Jessica, the sexual know-it-all who is on hand to give advice.There are three other actors that deserve mention. Eugene Levy is hilarious as Jim's Dad. The teenage years would be smooth sailing if every teenage guy's dad was Mr. Levenstein. When he finds out about his son's interest in sex, he's not horrified, he presents him with porn! Seann William Scott benefited most from his performance as the obnoxious and egotistic Stifler, who's so stupid that he doesn't realize that no one actually likes him. Jennifer Coolidge is hilarious as Stifler's Mom (more than that I will not say).If you want to really laugh (and laugh hard), 'American Pie' is a great way to go.",8,0,0,21 October 2009
Burn After Reading," Boring and tedious
","The Coen Brothers are the rebels of the film industry. They never use Hollywood conventions and formulas, and that's what makes them so unique. The Cormac McCarthy book, 'No Country for Old Men,' was considered unfilmable by many, yet it was lauded by critics and audiences alike (it won, though undeservedly, the Best Picture Oscar, but I thought 'Atonement' was better). However, while the Coens' are undeniably talented, they are not flawless. And this time, they've created a real stinker.There's a lot going on in this movie, very little of which is actually interesting. The main storyline revolves around a pair of nitwit gym employees (both of whom would rival Romy and Michelle for lack of brainpower) who get a hold of a disk of private information belonging to an (ex) CIA analyst, Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), and use it to get rich quick by various means.The characters here are either idiots or too smart for their own good. None of them, however, are interesting or funny. All the actors, which include Brad Pitt (as one of the brainless gym employees), Frances McDormand (as the other one), John Malkovich, George Clooney as a paranoid philanderer), and Tilda Swinton (as Cox's wife), have given terrific performances in the past, and they certainly give it their all in this film, but it's all for naught. This movie really sucks.Part of the problem is that it's bloated. Clooney and Swinton's roles are more or less inconsequential, and could have been almost completely written out. But the real reason is that for all the twists and shocks (something the Coens are famous for), is that it's just boring and unfunny.Avoid.",2,3,6,20 June 2010
Watchmen," Awesome
","Comic books had their heyday from the Great Depression through the fifties. Although they are not as popular now as they were at the time, they still have their devoted fans (the tide does appear to be changing with the rising popularity of Japanese animation, or manga). 'Watchmen' is considered the greatest graphic novel of all time (and TIME magazine listed it as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century). Having read it (but not being a comic book fan myself), I can say that Alan Moore's graphic novel is very good, but most of its accolades are unwarranted. Many of the themes present have been told before, and seem rather tired (that being said, I read it about a quarter of a century after its initial publication, so maybe time simply hasn't been good to it).That being said, Zack Snyder's film version is not only excellent, but in my opinion, it's better than the source material. The graphic novel was dense and at times highly confusing, forcing me to go back and revisit past parts of the story. The film version is more streamlined, and less padded, without losing any of the book's impact or intelligence. I don't understand why the audience reaction was so polarized. Of course there are the hard-core fans, who think any film version will be a butchery of their Holy Bible (past attempts at filming hit books have proved them right for the most part). Then there's the writer, Alan Moore, who refused to have his name listed as the author of the book, but he's done that ever since 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' came out (an over-reaction in my book. While 'LXG' was no 'The Dark Knight,' it's entertaining to watch when it's on TV).Speaking of 'The Dark Knight,' that's probably the film to compare 'Watchmen' to. This is no 'Spider-Man.' 'Watchmen' is a dark, violent and menacing world. The R-rating is warranted (for once). Not only does it contain some gory violence (though not as much as the MPAA would lead you to believe), it contains the first sex scene on film in years.'Watchmen' takes place in an alternate reality. It's 1985, and Nixon is still the President (Watergate is never addressed). In the past, men and women dressed up in costumes with the requisite gadgets and fought crime, or committed it. But legal action has made crime-fighting superheroes a thing of the past, so all the ex-heroes can do is go about their days like everyone else and reminisce about the past. However, for a group of superheroes who called themselves the 'Watchmen,' a new threat has surfaced. One of their crew was murdered, and the threat of a 'mask killer' puts them all in danger.The most apparent change is most of the material regarding the first band of 'Watchmen' has been eliminated. In my opinion, this was a good move, since that stuff made the story more convoluted than necessary, and never really added anything anyway. Most of the material remains, however, and I swear some of the dialogue has been lifted directly from the novel itself. That's good, because some of the dialogue is brilliant (and not just the catchphrases).The acting is surprisingly good. Malin Ackerman is solid as Silk Spectre II. She's an ordinary girl with an extraordinary past. Patrick Wilson is a big surprise as Nite Owl II. He's an effective lead, despite having a past of flat performances (he has some bland moments here, too, but overall his low-key portrayal works). Matthew Goode is rather flat as Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, although the script's version of the character didn't come out very well. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is good as the gruff Comedian. He's dark and vicious, but The Comedian was never a well-developed character to begin with, and that hasn't changed here. Jackie Earl Haley is excellent as Rorschach, the dangerous psychopath who took the vigilante part of being a superhero to heart. However, the biggest surprise is Billy Crudup. Save for a few feature film appearances, Crudup has laid low with his career, but his Dr. Manhattan gives him a chance to display his true talent. Of all the Watchmen, Dr. Manhattan is truly the most dynamic. He has the traditional superhero origins (a scientific experiment gone awry), but Moore opted for something far less conventional. Crudup (and Snyder) respect that. Dr. Manhattan has become superhuman, and in so doing, he becomes alienated from humanity. This, and the resulting toll it has on his relationships, is perfectly portrayed by Crudup.Zack Snyder got the public's attention with his re-envisioning of 'Dawn of the Dead,' but he REALLY burst onto the scene with his stunning and visually arresting version of '300.' Snyder clearly has a sense of visual flair. It suits him well for 'Watchmen,' but Moore's comic has a more complex story, and to bring a competent version of the novel to the screen, a director has to have a good sense of how to tell a story. Snyder has it, and that's what makes this film so good. There are times where he borders on overuse with the camera tricks, but it's not excessive. But Snyder can tell a story in a way that is clear and concise, but also involving.'Watchmen' isn't flawless, but it's one of the best superhero movies ever to come out in a while.",8,3,6,26 July 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent adventure
","Personally, I'm not a big fan of fantasy. I find it rather pretentious and for most entries into the genre, silly and/or melodramatic. But Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is an exception. It's a grand adventure filled with limitless energy and likable characters. The series is at the top of the IMDb 'Top 250' list, and rightly so. The first installment is extraordinary.I'm going to skip over the plot because by now everyone knows it. The acting is pitch-perfect across the board. Elijah Wood has clearly grown out of his kid roles, and is terrific as Frodo. His co-star Ian McKellen may have gotten the Oscar nod for his role, but Wood equals him. Likewise, McKellen finds the right note for Gandalf. Everyone else is perfectly suited for their roles as well. Special note goes to Sean Bean, who made a career out of playing creeps and villains, is successful as Boromir, and shows that he has more range than people may give him credit for.The stakes were incredibly high for this film series, and obviously it paid off. Peter Jackson deserves much of the credit. His work here is the fantasy answer to George Lucas' 'Star Wars' saga. Unlike much of today's CGI, it wasn't done cheaply, and everything looks authentic, and the result is breathtaking. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not. But Jackson's skill goes beyond the effects. Much of the acclaim of Tolkien's series is the fact that he created a whole new world. Jackson does the same thing; it doesn't feel like a bunch of effects were added to sets or everything was in front of a blue screen. Jackson has created a whole new world, just like Tolkien did.Of course, this would not be worth anything if Jackson and his co-writers hadn't written a screen adaptation that was worthy of the book (which I have not read). Everything moves smoothly and nothing feels left out or short-changed.Many films have been destroyed by too much hype. But 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is so grand that nothing could diminish its spectacle. And what a film to deserve it!",10,2,2,28 July 2008
Lilo & Stitch," Works better than it should
","Disney, the King of Film Animation. Well, it was at one point. Now Dreamworks is giving them a run for their money, but never mind. This is a Disney movie, although the film has taken its competitor's taste for the irreverent and mixed it with its own Disney heart.Stitch is a monster created by the 'mad scientist' Dr. Jumba (Disney animation regular David Ogden Stiers). But because such experimentation is illegal (and Stitch is engineered to be a complete menace), Jumba is arrested and Stitch is ordered into exile. But clever Stitch escapes to Earth, and Jumba and another alien, Pleakly (Kevin McDonald) are sent to bring him back. Meanwhile, Stitch gets adopted by a little girl named Lilo (Daveigh Chase), who after the death of her parents, is being raised by her older sister, Nani (Tia Careere). But while the inclusion of Stitch into the picture may have been made with good intentions, he may end up causing enough trouble to get Lilo taken away to an orphanage.The voice actors are good. Daveigh Chase is excellent as the shy and awkward little girl. She wants friends, but she lacks the appropriate social skills (it doesn't help that the other girls treat her like crap). Tia Careere, whose career has been in a rut despite being in one of my all-time favorite movies ('True Lies'), is great as Nani. They may drive each other nuts, but Nani really cares about her sister. David Ogden Stiers is suitably kooky as Dr. Jumba, while Kevin McDonald equals him as the neurotic PETA-clone (some may find his vocalization annoying though).The problem with the film is that we really come to care about Lilo and Nani. Any time Stitch wreaks havoc (which he frequently does), it is at the expense of Lilo and Nani's shaky stability. His hilarious chaos makes their life harder, and the movie struggles to find a balance between the two. Also, the animation is sub-par, especially when compared to the likes of the previous animated films Disney brought us.That being said, 'Lilo and Stitch' is still a lot of fun for the whole family.",7,4,5,25 October 2009
American Psycho," Provocative satire of the 80's
","I watched this movie a few years ago and although I respected it, I didn't care for it because it was so superficial. I watched it again, realizing what it was trying to do. This time I liked it a lot better.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a Wall Street wizard, living the dream life. He's young, successful, and good looking. But everything is not right with Patrick. He is incapable of any emotion 'except greed and disgust.' He sees himself as a facade ('I am simply not there'). But while living the good life by day, he is a serial killer by night.For anyone who follows the politics of movie making, 'American Psycho' is one of the more notorious. It's yet another example of the MPAA's prudishness getting in the way of film-making. The film was given an NC-17 rating until director Mary Harron was forced to cut a scene where Bateman is having a threesome with two prostitutes. Never mind that it is extremely revealing about his character, nor the fact that they left all of the bloody violence untouched. It's a sex-scene, which is a no-no for the MPAA (none of its members, apparently, have cable television, because if they did, they would notice that there are more explicit sex scenes on weekly TV shows).But that shouldn't detract from the quality of the film (the unrated DVD has been out for a few years, so there's no need to accept the MPAA's neo-conservative version). The film is well-acted, and often darkly humorous.Christian Bale burst onto the A list after his dynamite performance as Bateman. His cool, smooth voice belies his capacity for violence. Yet Bateman can change moods instantaneously, and Bale is adept at switching moods at will, even only for a few seconds. The other cast members (Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon, and so on) are great as his friends and co-workers (or fiancée, as Witherspoon is), who are so superficial and self-centered that they don't know, or care, about Bale's extracurricular activities (and it's not as if he's THAT discreet about it). Samantha Mathis is good as is drugged-out mistress, and Willem Dafoe is solid as the private detective who may or may not be onto Bale.Mary Harron knows and understands the material. It's a thriller, but also a dark comedy. The humor isn't in your face, but if you really think about it, these characters are completely ridiculous. She's not afraid to show violence, but she also knows that she's not making a slasher movie.Maybe it's because I'm not a child of the 80's, but I didn't get all the humor. I got the satire about being superficial, but the serial killer aspect eluded me. Still, it's enjoyable enough to recommend.",7,0,0,5 December 2009
U-571," Relentless action and suspense
","Lovers of 'Das Boot,' get in line and see 'U-571.' Submarine warfare has returned to the big screen, and it's a non-stop thriller! While not a true story, it's still a lot of fun. And besides, who goes to a summer action movie to actually learn something?The set-up is genius. A U.S. Navy Submarine led by Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) is given a crucial assignment. Steal a code machine from a crippled U-boat (German submarine). Everything goes according to plan, except the U.S. sub is destroyed by a nearby German vessel, and the boarding party, led by Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) is left to command the broken sub.This is an action movie, and it doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. In a movie like this, all that matters is action, action, and more action. Suspense is desired, but a movie can succeed without it. Fortunately, 'U-571' has both, and in great amounts. The story starts out slowly to help us get to know the characters, but once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Ever.'U-571' is populated by a number of good performances. In general, I don't like Matthew McConaughey. In the right role, he can be effective, but usually he just mails in performances in formulaic romantic comedies. But 'U-571' calls for him to carry the movie on his own, and he delivers. Andrew Tyler is a man who thinks he knows what to do, but it turns out he has a lot of learning to do. He can alternately be like a father figure and a tough-as-nails, do-what-I-say-or-else commander. McConaughey hits every note. He's aided by his CPO Henry Klough, ably played by Harvey Keitel. Klough is a man who does his job no matter what, and expects everyone to do the same. He's the veteran among the crew, but he knows his place, and he stays there. Jake Weber is suitably mysterious as the man who knows everything about the code machine, but doesn't talk about it unless he has to. This is a guy who spends his time behind a desk instead of out in the field, so being in an situation is not something he's used to (then again, nor is to for anyone else, but they're submarine sailors, and he isn't). Rounding out the young (though severely underdeveloped) cast are David Keith, Jon Bon Jovi, Tom Guiry, Will Estes, Jack Noseworthy, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson, Erik Palladino and Dave Power. All are likable and perform ably. Thomas Kretschmann is the German hostage, but again, he's not that developed.One of the reasons that 'U-571' works as well as it does is that director Jonathan Mostow is able to create a claustrophobic atmosphere. Any personality deficiencies are not as problematic because we feel right like we're there with the crew. But Mostow's skill doesn't end there. He keeps things moving, and the audience never has a break from the tension. Just as one situation closes, another one is right around the corner. In retrospect, this decreases credibility, but for the constraints of a two-hour movie, it doesn't matter. Besides, you won't be thinking about it while you're watching it.Comparisons to the classic WWII submarine movie 'Das Boot' are unavoidable. In terms of quality, Wolfgang Peterson's classic is better, but for those who don't have the time (or can't stand subtitles), 'U-571' does the trick. Or if you're just looking for a two-hour jolt of adrenaline, this movie will work for that too. Either way, 'U-571' doesn't disappoint.",8,0,5,10 June 2009
The Shining," Pure Psychological Horror
","Often times the scariest things are the subtle irregularities in life; the little things that seem...off. In 'The Blair Witch Project' it was the little things going wrong that built up the tension (losing the map, no cigarettes, etc.). Time and again movies have proved that they're often scarier when there's little to no violence and gore. 'Paranormal Activity,' 'Blair Witch Project,' 'Psycho,' and even 'Halloween.' 'The Shining' belongs in the same category, although it is different from any of those films because the terror comes from the characters descent into madness, not a psychopathic killer.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a wannabe writer who has taken a job looking after a hotel during the snowy season (the 20 mile cliffside road leading to the hotel rules out the possibility of a ski resort). For five months, Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and son Dann(Danny Lloyd) are going to live at the Overlook Hotel in complete isolation. But before long, the lack of human contact begins to really get to them.Human beings are social creatures. We need to interact with each other in order to survive. Take away that interaction, and the mind begins to try and cope, and the results are frequently not pretty. This premise, which was raised in Stephen King's novel upon which the film is based, but was discarded in favor of a traditional ghost story with fantasy elements. Kubrick, for the most part, has completely rejected the ghost story and instead focuses on the psychological trauma that complete isolation does to the human mind.The acting is solid, but this is Kubrick's show. As someone who was well read in psychology, it comes as no surprise that that the famous filmmaker knows just how to generate fear. His unique camera shots and use of dissonant music are masterful. We can feel the madness of the characters, and that's what makes this film so scary.It's not flawless, however. There are a few plot holes, and some parts of the plot and characters are a little too elusive (then again, that may have been Kubrick's goal). But the biggest problem is that Kubrick kept some of the fantasy from King's book. It is unnecessary in Kubrick's vision of the film, and it should have been written out completely (a more plausible explanation would be obvious to anyone).Nevertheless, this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Once the tension starts to build, it never stops and never lets up (the finale is genuinely terrifying).My rating: Rated R for some violence/gore, pervasive terror, and brief language.",8,0,1,9 June 2010
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A romantic comedy that's actually funny and romantic
","In general, romantic comedies tend to be successful because of their ability to generate laughter. This is because most movies are cast because of their star-power, not whether the actors have chemistry with each other. So when a movie comes along that actually makes us care about the characters' relationship (and I mean really care, not just for the sake of the story), people take notice. While Judd Apatow's 2005 film can boast a few funny scenes, it's the romance between the two central characters that really takes this movie to the next level.Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is an all around nice-guy. He's a little geeky, but a good soul. However, he's 40 years old, and he's never gotten laid...ever. So his co-workers make it a mission to get him some action. Meanwhile, he's attracted to a GILF (grandmother I'd like to...you know) named Trish (Catherine Keener). But will she be turned off by a guy who's never had sex (and will obviously be pretty bad at it the first time)? Steve Carell become really popular because of the success of 'The Office,' a show that I hate. 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' still has a lot of understated humor, but unlike 'The Office,' this movie is funny. Carrell is the perfect choice for Andy because he's so geeky that you can't help but like the guy. He's a nerd, but also nice and genuine. His romantic interest, Catherine Keener, is delightful. Keener is so natural in the role that it's hard to believe that this is a performance. It doesn't take long for the audience to realize that these two belong together. His co-workers, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and especially Romany Malco are pretty funny as the guys who are egging him on. However, the funniest moments have to go to Gerry Bedknob, who has some hysterical scenes.Judd Apatow redefined comedy for the 2000's. His trademarks are understated one-liners and raunchy jokes (although I am at a loss to understand why this nearly got an NC-17 rating...it's all talk, and none of it is especially graphic). In general, I'm not a fan of understated humor. Humor has to be energetic, almost manic. The Farrelly brothers got that, Chris Farley got that, but Judd Apatow doesn't. That's not to say that this is a waste; there's some funny stuff here (like the Date-a-palooza scene), but a lot of the stuff just isn't as funny as it should be. What Apatow should be congratulated for is making the romance work. Many romantic comedies spend so much time on the jokes and forget that we're supposed to want the characters to end up together. Apatow remembers this and that's the most effective part of the movie.Funny, romantic, and endearing, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is a good movie, plain and simple.",7,0,2,5 April 2010
Face_Off," Near brilliant
","Wow! This could have been such a bad movie! The story is ridiculous, and in the hands of someone less talented than John Woo, it could make no sense. More importantly, had the two leads been less talented, the premise would have been impossible to buy. Yet 'Face/Off' is done so well that it is a near masterpiece.Sean Archer (John Travolta) is an FBI agent who has spent his career tracking the terrorist Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage). When Archer finally catches Troy, he discovers that the terrorist has planted a bomb somewhere, and in order to find it, Archer has to (quite literally) switch faces with Troy to interrogate his paranoid-schizophrenic brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). Of course, complications arise when Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face for himself. So now Archer is Troy and Troy is Archer! Like I said, the story is beyond ridiculous. But the script is written intelligently enough that the characters act realistically. But that is beside the point. There are two things that make this film great: an outstanding cast, and John Woo.There was a time when movie stars were stars because of their acting ability, not because of how well they sold themselves to the tabloids and the celebrity gossip magazines. It shows here. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage have fun with their roles. They clearly studied each other's mannerisms and mimic them, so it's always clear that they are ACTING like their counterpart, not because the story says so.But Cage and Travolta are not the only ones with memorable performances. The supporting actors are played by skilled thespians as well, all of whom care about the film enough to flesh out their parts. The villains are fleshed out enough that they cease to become really villains. We gain sympathy for them because they act like real people. Nick Cassavetes and especially the always wonderful Gina Gershon are prime examples. And it's also great to see Colm Feore and the always terrific CCH Pounder.Then there is John Woo. Instead of taking the easy, safe way out and making it dumb, campy fun, he's got the guts and the skill to make it an full-out action movie. And it works. Of course, there are times when his little flourishes are too much, but that's just nit-picking.'Face/Off' comes so close to being a ten, SO CLOSE! It comes so close that I nearly gave it that rating, but after thinking it over I can't in good conscience do so. The reason? The ending. The main problem is Travolta. For 90% of the movie, he holds his own and does brilliant work. But in the film's last scenes he goes over the top and goes into 'Broken Arrow' mode (ironically also a John Woo film), and it casts a pall over the last action sequence. So close, but no cigar.Still, this is a great film, and a wild ride.",10,3,4,30 June 2008
Collateral," Effective psychological thriller
","There's something eerie about driving through Los Angeles in the middle of the night; things are moving and there are people about, but overall the large bustling city is sleeping. No one can capture this feeling like Michael Mann; he did it in his modern crime classic 'Heat,' and he does it here. This film has the earmarks of a classic thriller: a brilliant script, an expert director, and a couple of nice performances. Unfortunately, the most important role in this film is miscast.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a nice guy cab driver who would rather help a stressed out fare (Jada Pinkett Smith) get to her destination faster than go her way and get a few extra bucks because it takes longer. However, the stressed out yuppies that he usually has to deal with are going to be the least of his problems. Late one night, a man walks into his cab and tells him that he will pay 600 dollars to have Max drive him to six destinations in one night. But it isn't before long before Max realizes that the man, who calls himself Vincent (Tom Cruise) isn't closing a real estate deal; he's knocking off targets.For the most part, this is a two-man game of cat-and-mouse between the cold Vincent and the meek Max. It's almost all dialogue and no real action, which would be okay if the film had a better villain. As written, Vincent is a cold, brutal killer. As played by Tom Cruise, he's just Tom Cruise without his famous cheeky grin. Cruise is just not up to the task of playing a conscienceless villain. As the soft-spoken cabbie Max, Jamie Foxx is terrific. His strong performance keeps us interested in this unfolding drama, primarily because it's impossible not to like him.After 'Heat,' this is easily Michael Mann's best film. It's stylishly filmed, and it oozes with the after-hours atmosphere. There are moments when it drags slightly, and things can get a little confusing here and there, but Mann is a master craftsman.Without a doubt I recommend the film. The suspense builds steadily into a heart-pounding (if slightly overdone) ending, and it's almost always interesting. But I just can't help but feel that this movie could have been so much more if someone more able to play a sociopathic killer than Tom Cruise could have played Vincent.",7,0,0,30 May 2010
Aliens," Scary and Action-packed...guaranteed to leave you exhausted
","Typically, when you get a sequel to a hit movie, it is two things: a, very similar in style and content, and inferior to its predecessor. 'Aliens' is neither. I originally compared 'Alien' to 'Halloween.' If you held that same analogy, 'Aliens' would be like 'The Rock,' only instead of a bunch of renegade marines taking over Alcatraz, you'd have duplicates of Michael Meyers. The bottom line is that 'Alien' and 'Aliens' could not be more different. And if I may say so, this 1986 masterpiece is a lot scarier.Ellen Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) escape pod has been picked up, only for her to learn that she's been in a cryogenic sleep for 57 years. Ripley faces an inquiry, where she loses her license and because no one believes her story about the alien, is confined to a mental institution. To make matters worse, her daughter has recently died. However, a corporate guy named Burke (Paul Reiser) offers her a chance for redemption: assist a group of marines investigating a lost signal on the planet where she encountered the alien, and she gets her life back. Reluctantly, Ripley agrees...This movie is tense. And when I say tense, I mean TENSE! Screaming your lungs out, shaking with fear, and sweating profusely tense. I've never seen an action movie that left me this worn out after viewing it.The actors do great work. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, and this time, she's not just a stock character avoiding gruesome death at the hands of a nightmarish monster. To be sure, she does do that, but James Cameron completely revamps her character. She's scared as hell, but she's a tough cookie when it really matters. Especially when it comes to Newt (Carrie Henn), a young girl whom Ripley takes on as a surrogate daughter. Paul Reiser is a little hammy in the beginning, but he's nevertheless effective as the corporate tagalong who may not be telling everything he knows. And Michael Biehn makes for a very sympathetic Hicks, adding a little understated romantic chemistry with Ripley. Everyone else, including James Cameron regulars Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein, are very effective.Once again, James Cameron has created a superlative motion picture. But instead of creating the epics we have become used to, this is a movie in top form of the kind where he made his mark on Hollywood: the science fiction thriller. It's not perfect, and arguably his weakest film. But it contains some of the most frighteningly tense and scary moments ever to grace the silver screen.One of the greatest sequels of all time and one hell of a ride, 'Aliens' is a must see for the action and/or horror lover, or any adrenaline junkie looking for a rush.",10,3,5,23 May 2010
American History X," Wow
","When the credits started rolling after the film 'American History X,' the one word, the one feeling that I felt was: Wow. This is an amazing, powerful film.One could quickly classify this as a film that deals with racism, but that is a misconception. 'American History X' is about hate, and one man's journey from having it rule his life to realizing how pointless it is.Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) was the poster-boy for a white supremacist gang in California. Things changed after he was sent to prison for murder, and now he's trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path.'American History X' is like the ultimate persuasive speech, both in what it achieves and how it's constructed. This powerful film tackles a complex and relevant subject head-on. But its construction as a piece of skilled rhetoric is genius. There's the set-up, addressing of both sides of the issue, then finally the explanation of the point that it wants to make. Director Tony Kaye deftly handles the material so that the subject matter, rather than directorial flair, is what hammers in the point. And he uses enough subtlety to make 'American History X' seem more like a film than a piece of rhetoric.What makes this film work so well is that it seeks to UNDERSTAND both sides of the issue. It doesn't humanize people who hate, and it certainly doesn't expect the audience to sympathize with them, but it explains why they hate. This makes for a more compelling argument because it allows for a more finely-tuned rebuttal. The fact that the skinheads, at least Derek Vinyard, are allowed to sound intelligent, gives a fresh look on an argument that if done any other way would give this film a 'been there, done that' kind of feel.Additionally, it gives insight into the sources of hate and how people like the skinheads become the frontrunners of such feelings. It offers a number of origins and introduces them in a number of ways.This film wouldn't be as compelling and powerful had it not been for a cast filled with superior performances. Edward Norton received an Oscar nod for this role, and he earned it. This is easily his best performance. His character has a wide, dramatic arc and Norton never loses sight of the character. Edward Furlong is impressive as Danny. Furlong has been almost off the map since his star-making debut opposite Arnold Schwartzenegger and Linda Hamilton in 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' Here he makes it clear that he hasn't grown out of his acting ability. Beverly D'Angelo shows that she can act off of someone other than Chevy Chase (and in a hard-hitting drama, no less). Stacy Keach is suitably creepy and vile as Cameron, the man who helped Derek with his rise to 'god' status amongst the skinheads, but Keach wisely never goes over the top. Elliot Gould, Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee (in an unexpectedly fine performance) are all in good form here.The one person who gets no praise but deserves much is Avery Brooks. He's brilliant and at times equal to Norton. He fills the mentor role, but he knows this is not supposed to be a gentle performance a la Robin Williams in 'Dead Poet's Society' (no ill-will towards Williams' role in that film); he's gritty and forceful and he fits right in. It's a shame that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his performance.According to IMDb, director Tony Kaye claimed that Edward Norton altered the film so much to give himself an Oscar nod for his performance that Kaye wanted his name to be replaced by 'Humpty Dumpty.' He filed a $275 million lawsuit against the Director's Guild and New Line Cinema when he wasn't allowed to remove his name. Be that as it may, at least the result was not the disaster that usually happens to a film that suffers from too much interference from someone OTHER than the director. It's hard to imagine this film being any better. Still, it would be interesting to see the director's cut of the film (the deleted scenes aren't much help in guessing what Kaye's original vision was, as they're mostly the sort of throwaway scenes that had a reason for being left on the cutting room floor).While I respect Kaye's decision for wanting his name removed, having been left with his name on the film is not exactly a bad thing. In fact, his work is amazing. The scenes from Derek's past are shown in black and white (no hint of film noir-style from the oldie films), and the scenes from the present are shown in color. Kaye acted as his own cinematographer, and his skill in both positions is evident.Insightful, provocative, and undeniably powerful, 'American History X' is a brilliant film, and one that needs to be seen.",10,1,3,12 July 2008
Spirited Away," Pure magic
","While the Walt Disney Company may have created some masterful animated films, and Pixar appears to be the new king in animation, neither one is really king. No one, and I mean NO ONE, tops Hayao Miyazaki. With his signature sense of magic and wonder, jaw-dropping imagery, and deep and involving storytelling, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a master. And this is easily his best film.A young girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) is moving with her parents (Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis) to a new town, and she's not happy about it. Along the way to their new home, they make a wrong turn and end up in a mysterious place. To her horror, Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs, and she becomes trapped in a bathhouse for the gods! Worse, its run by Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), a ruthless caretaker who traps people into servitude by stealing their names. Now, in order to save her parents and make it back to the real world, the whiny and fearful girl has to grow up and survive in this strange new place.The first thing that one recognizes when they begin to watch a Miyazaki film is that the animation is gorgeous. The imagery in his films (particularly this one) is nothing short of a work of art. This is the Mona Lisa of film animation. I am not exaggerating. Even if you watched the film on mute, you will not be able to take your eyes off of it. Every frame is so lovingly crafted and detailed that it takes many viewings to soak it all in.The second thing one notices about his films is that they all have a strong sense of magic and wonder. Watching a Miyazaki film is like being taken back into the innocence of childhood dreams. All the fond memories one has of childhood are brought back to the forefront with this film. The mixture of the dreamy music and images is intoxicating. The sense of magic that this film exudes is indescribable, and only Miyazaki has been able to create it.Finally comes the story, which is the heart of the film. His stories are always strong and engaging, but this one takes the cake. This is a brilliant (and unpredictable) story that will charm and captivate film goers of all ages. Most family films are meant for kids, but have a few one-liners or references aimed at adults. Not here. This story and its themes apply to everyone, regardless of age.Like most top-quality anime films, 'Spirited Away' has been dubbed by English language actors. Under the direction of John Lasseter (of Pixar fame), every theme and idea has been preserved, and the dubbed lines are beautifully written and acted by a talented cast. Daveigh Chase is probably most famous for her portrayal of the evil Samara Morgan from 'The Ring,' but in that film, she didn't speak. As Chihiro, she demonstrates immense talent. In the beginning, she is whiny, nervous, and pretty obnoxious. But through Chase's vocal work, we are able to see her transformation. Chihiro is helped along by two friends, Haku (Jason Marsden) and Lin (Susan Egan), and both are brilliantly portrayed. Marsden has a unique, hypnotic voice, which he uses to good effect in the role. Haku is an authoritative young boy, but he really cares for Chihiro. Marsden is able to manipulate his signature voice to great effect to portray all facets of the character, and his voice is so seductive that it makes the low-key attraction between Haku and Chihiro come to the forefront. Likewise, Susan Egan is terrific as the sassy, but helpful Lin. Lin is a sassy girl who quickly befriends Chihiro in an older sister sort of way. Egan voices Lin in this exact way, and it works. As Zeniba, Suzanne Pleshette is a nasty piece of work. Zeniba is a vicious creature, and while she may look comical, Pleshette makes her anything but. When the characters say that Zeniba is dangerous, they aren't lying. However, she has a soft side, as she dotes incessantly on her 20 foot tall baby, Boh (Tara Strong).Yet, the real star is unquestionably Miyazaki. There's more to making a film than writing, directing, and having a great cast. The film is well-paced, and NEVER boring (either visually or story-wise). Like all of his films, 'Spirited Away' is thematically complex, dealing with such issues as identity, self-esteem, anxiety, over-coming obstacles, and environmentalism (a Miyazaki trademark). Yet, these are portrayed with such skill that no one will really miss them or misunderstand them (and they are illustrated with the correct amount of subtlety).As good as this film is (and it's VERY good), it's not perfect. There's really only one complaint that I have, and it's with the ending. Without giving anything away, I will say that it is unexplained. We know what happens, but not how it happens. Most people weren't bothered by this, however, so this may be just the film critic speaking.Nevertheless, this film is a near-masterpiece, and regardless of the ending (the question left unanswered isn't especially important anyway), it is one of my favorite films, especially on a bad day.",10,0,1,27 January 2010
Quantum of Solace," What?
","While no one will ever credit the Bond movies (save for perhaps the last Bond movie, 'Casino Royale,' but only if they're feeling especially generous) for being in the least bit credible, they at least made sense. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for our beloved agent's most recent outing, 'Quantum of Solace.' And as much as I hate to admit it, the blame has to fall on director Marc Forster.If you want information about the plot, look at the synopsis, because that will give you more information about the plot than I could (yes, it's that bad).Without a doubt 'Quantum of Solace' is inferior to the first 'reboot' of James Bond movies, 2006's 'Casino Royale.' But Bond's latest adventure has one thing going for it that the last one didn't: it actually FEELS like a Bond movie. Don't get me wrong, I liked 'Casino Royale,' but it was so different and serious that it didn't FEEL like a Bond movie. While 'Quantum of Solace' may be just as serious (if not more so), it has the same format and number of over-the-top action sequences as the predecessors (except for 'Casino Royale,' of course).The acting varies. Daniel Craig has grown more comfortable with his interpretation of Bond, and isn't afraid to develop it more. Bond in this outing is angrier, deadlier, and a lot more serious. Except for one instance, sleeping with women is not his first priority. He has only one thing on his mind: finding the people behind Vesper's death, and that means getting to the new villain, Dominic Greene (Matheiu Amalric). To say that Amalric is not one of the better villains is putting it mildly. Well, to be fair, the movie doesn't really let us get to know him very well, but he's still pretty weak. Olga Kurylenko is solid as Camille, but again, not the BEST Bond girl. Everyone else is what you'd expect them to be coming from the previous movie.I like Marc Forster, I really do. He is a terrific director, and has done splendid work with 'Finding Neverland' and 'The Kite Runner.' If you notice, neither of those films are similar to a Bond movie (or any action movie whatsoever). That, I think, is the problem. He doesn't know what to do with the material. The film moves so fast and frenetically that it loses the viewer pretty early, and it never really gains them back (he continues the trend of action movies of unsteady camera action sequences--and doesn't do it well). Scenes work by themselves, but as a whole it is a mess. I hope this film doesn't ruin Forster's career, because that would be a shame. Just no more Bond movies for him.Do I recommend it? It really doesn't matter because Bond is so popular that everyone will go see it regardless of how bad the word of mouth is. But I honestly don't know if I could tell someone to go see it if they were on the fence.",5,2,4,28 November 2008
Independence Day," The Ultimate Summer Action Movie...Period.
","This is it. The penultimate summer action movie. Car's don't explode, they fly 50 feet away. Buildings don't fall down, they get incinerated. And if that's not enough, New York doesn't just get busted up, it gets leveled...along with every other major city in the world.There's only one guy ballsy enough to make this movie, and that's Roland Emmerich. 'Big' just doesn't cut it. Nor does 'epic,' for that matter. You have to at least admire a guy that completely skips on the kitchen sink and instead throws in New York, Los Angeles, The Presidency, and a space ship that's a quarter the size of our moon. Now THAT'S what I'm talking' about!Of course, it helps tremendously that 'Independence Day' is immensely entertaining. The action, of which there is plenty, is exciting, and there are more one-liners than there are fingers and toes of you and the person sitting next to you. And, oh yeah, don't forget the creepy aliens.Anyway, the story stars on July 3, when radar picks up a signal coming from the moon. Then, after introducing us to the surprisingly vast array of characters, the alien ships show up. And they're not looking to become your next door neighbor. So after causing massive destruction, a few stragglers gather together to bring them down.Yes, that's vastly oversimplifying things. But for a movie that has so much going on, it accomplishes everything it sets out to do: provide eye-popping action, and a good few laughs along the way. Nothing seems to be left out, and there aren't any glaring mistakes.The cast is made up of a few well known faces and a surprising amount of character actors. All of them do their job extremely well. Of them, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman can be considered the 'main' characters. Will Smith is one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood, and it's not hard to see why. He has more range than is often recognized, and his screen appeal is undeniable. He also has considerable comic skill (after all, he was the star of one of the funniest sitcoms ever on TV). His performance as fighter pilot Captain Steven Hiller is among his best performances. Jeff Goldblum is once again playing a geek, but unlike 'Jurassic Park,' Goldblum's David Levinson is not an egotistical jerk. He has solid chemistry with his co-stars, specifically Smith, and his father, Julius (well-played by Judd Hirsch). Bill Pullman is the weakest of the three, although that's hardly a damning statement. He acquits himself well enough amidst the surrounding talent, and never fades into the background (which he has done in other roles). The smaller roles are made up of recognizable faces, including Randy Quaid as an alcoholic pilot (played with the off-the-wall panache that only Randy Quaid can give), Mary McDonnell as the First Lady, Robert Loggia as a general, Vivica A. Fox as Hiller's stripper girlfriend, Margaret Colin as a Presidential aide (and David's ex). Cameos by Harvey Fierstein as David's co-worker and Brent Spiner as an off-the-wall scientist are also good. But special mention has to go to Harry Connick, Jr. as Jimmy Wilder, Hiller's best friend. Connick is electrifying, and often steals scenes from Smith (something that is quite difficult).This is summer fun, and Emmerich knows this. There's never a moment where it takes itself very seriously (even though there are a few times where the opportunity arises). Critics weren't very approving of this movie, and you know what? It doesn't matter. This is not an artistic movie of any sort. It's plain and simply entertaining.",10,6,12,22 April 2010
District 9," A breath of fresh air in a time of bloated sequels and rip-offs!
","Ever since Neill Blomkamp was lined to do the film version of the 'Halo' video game, he's become a household name with the fanboys. But as we all know, that project stalled and Blomkamp is no longer on board as a director. After that happened, Peter Jackson gave Blomkamp $30 million to make whatever movie he wanted. Blomkamp made this film, and it is a stunning debut.Normally I despise remakes, but after viewing Blomkamp's short film, 'Alive in Joburg,' which served as the inspiration for this movie, I can say that calling 'District 9' a remake of the short film is about as untrue as it is unfair. Even saying that Blomkamp used the short film as a jumping off point is pushing it (a lot). 'District 9' takes the idea and runs with it, not even remembering to pass 'Go' and collect 200 dollars.South Africa, present day. A spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa, for the past 20 or so years. The aliens were brought down and nourished back to health, but people's apprehension with the new beings caused major clashes, and the visitors, known as 'prawns' were moved into a slum called District 9. Today, the shady corporation Multi-National United has decided to move the prawns to District 10, and to make sure that it's handled legally, they enlist Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) to oversee it. Suffice it to say, things don't go as planned.'District 9' is not flawless, but it's so good that I'm more than willing to look the other way at any of its 'flaws.' But the best part of it is that it takes chances. In broad strokes, the story is familiar, but the details and execution are completely new.One of the best things that I liked is how Blomkamp portrays people reacting to the aliens. Everything that the people do in response to them is completely credible. I don't want to give anything away, but the way that the people 'acted' in response to the coming of the prawns is so believable it's almost chilling. 'Interviews' with people who worked with Wikus and were involved in the story enhance this effect.Meanwhile, we have Wikus guiding us through the story. Wikus is eager, but he's not the brightest bulb in the bunch. Sharlto Copley is excellent as Wikus. Copley does a great job playing a poster boy for MNU, but Wikus is also likable, and that's important.'District 9' is a mixture of a million ideas all thrown together at once. Past movies have done this and sunk because of it, but 'District 9' succeeds because they're competently explained and portrayed. A few technical things cause this to get an 8 instead of a 10 (for example, one scene is interesting, but it's out of place, and the film's big transition doesn't go very well), but it's still a highly recommendable film. And for once, the shaking camera is used effectively.Do I think that Blomkamp should direct 'Halo?' While there's no question that he could do it, and make a great movie out of the game, I don't think he's the right man for the job. I don't think 'Halo' would look good as a grainy documentary. But that's just me.",8,22,36,14 September 2009
Saving Private Ryan," The finest war film ever made
","During the opening sequence when I saw the man's face and I was preparing myself for a long flashback, a growing sense of dread overcame me. Yet still I was not prepared for the horror that I was exposed to for the next 2 1/2 hours. Horror is the only way to describe this film. I wasn't simply watching the film. I was absorbed into it. Steven Spielberg is arguably the most famous film director out there, and for good reason too. He can make a film like no one else. Everything here works so well, the acting, the action sequences, the atmosphere and emotion. It's all here, and highly energized. This, along with Schindler's List, one of the greatest films in cinematic history. is Spielberg's masterpiece. One of the main reasons this film works is his cinematographer Janusz Kiminski. The grit of the camera sets up the atmosphere perfectly, and the lighting is superb because even when it's a sunny day, it's still covered in darkness. People have criticized this film for having a bad storyline. That's not true, not at all. While the storyline is simple and nothing new, it's because that's what it would have been like in real life. Life is not a intricately woven storyline like say The Silence of the Lambs, and the people with this film know that. The key to making this film work is making it real. And that it does.",10,4,7,9 April 2006
Revolutionary Road," The Real 'Leave it to Beaver'
","As human beings, we crave stability. The thought of sameness and certainty brings us a certain degree of comfort. But being comfortable and ordinary means sacrificing our chance to be truly extraordinary. To what degree do we give up our dreams for a sense of comfort and normalcy? Is an ordinary life worth giving up the chance to be someone special?Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) are a happily married couple. Frank is a dreamer, and wants to go back to Paris because people are 'alive' there, but after April became pregnant, they moved to the suburbs to live a normal life. But April is not happy as an ordinary housewife, and Frank is just as miserable having ended up in a job that he swore to avoid. So they decide to move to Paris so that they can live the life that they were 'meant' to. But are they willing to take that chance?In 1997, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet created one of the greatest screen romances of our time in 'Titanic.' Eleven years later, the real life best friends have returned on screen together in an entirely different kind of film. It is a credit to their skill and versatility that Frank and April Wheeler are NOTHING like Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt-Bukater. DiCaprio and Winslet are wonderful in their roles. Both are trapped in a situation that they hate, but can't escape.The other actors vary, however. Kathy Bates is miscast as Helen Givings, the only person who really seems to have fully bought into this sitcom-ish life. Bates is a good actress, but she's not right for the part. A cynic might say that this was to draw on the popularity of the 'Titanic' connection, but I doubt it. 'Revolutionary Road' will not appeal to that crowd, and the two leads are a strong enough appeal anyway (but with Hollywood, you never know...). Michael Shannon is excellent as John, Helen's son who was in the mental hospital for his opinion that this life that everyone seems to be living is a delusion. Shannon has made a career of off-the-wall performances, but this is one of his best. Unfortunately, the character sometimes comes off as a writer's construct than a real individual, and Shannon is unable to solve this problem. Of special note is David Harbour, who plays the Wheelers' next door neighbor and friend, Shep. It's a passionate and heartfelt performance, and it should grant Harbour some notice.Sam Mendes already peered behind the white picket fence in 'American Beauty,' which I have not seen. But there has been no greater criticism of the delusion portrayed by the classic 1950's sitcoms like 'Leave it to Beaver' and 'Father Knows Best' than 'Revolutionary Road.' But the true strength of the film is that it applies to every era of American life; our dreams our precious, and we cannot reach them without taking a chance.",8,0,0,27 April 2010
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Excellent sequel
","Like with all sequels, it is impossible to compare 'The Lost World' to its predecessor. Yes, it goes without saying that 'Jurassic Park' is the better of the two films. The first is a classic in its truest form, and this sequel has fallen from the tree, but not as far as many die-hard fans of the first might say.After the events of the first film, InGen is being subjected to billions of dollars in lawsuits and damages, and the survivors are left looking like idiots when the company won't back up their claims of what happened at the park. John Hammond is ousted by his nephew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), who is about to make a bigger mistake than his uncle did: bring the dinos to a zoo he built in San Diego. Hammond sent an expedition to study the dinos in their 'natural' habitat, including Nick (Vince Vaughn), Eddie (Richard Schiff), and Sara (Julianne Moore). He also gets Dr. Malcom (Jeff Goldblum), but he only goes to drag Sara, who is his girlfriend, and the others out of there before they become hors d'oeuvres for some very nasty dinosaurs.The best thing about 'The Lost World' is that it's not a clone of the first film. 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' showed us how badly a sequel can tank when it follows its predecessor too closely. Although there are many definite similarities (and not just the obvious ones, like characters and dinosaurs), 'The Lost World' is an altogether different film.The film generates plenty of tension and scares, but there are a few things that don't work. For one thing, Spielberg humanizes the dinosaurs too much. Monsters are more frightening when we see them as just that, not human beings who look like monsters. 'Jurassic Park' did that, but 'The Lost World' explains too much about the dinosaurs' (specifically the T-Rex) nature. Although this sets up the climax of the film, that one doesn't really work either.The acting is solid. Jeff Goldblum is his same sarcastic, cynical self. He's the voice of reason, but as filtered through Dr. Malcolm, it becomes original instead of a cliché. Julianne Moore wasn't widely recognized at the time of filming as the versatile actress that we now know she is, but once again, she demonstrates her versatility. Moore is just as home in an action movie as she is in a character drama. Arliss Howard is perfectly vile as the arrogant, hubristic Ludlow. Whereas Hammond was simply misguided, Ludlow is cold and sociopathic; he makes Scrooge McDuck look like Mother Theresa. Pete Poslethwaite is delicious as the Big Game hunter, bringing every cliché about the character type to the role and still seeming fresh and original. Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, and Vanessa Lee Chester also turn in solid performances.Steven Spielberg is a master filmmaker, and before he was into film just for the money, he took pleasure in making films. This isn't his best film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's also a lot better than most sequels.",8,0,1,6 March 2010
City of God," The Best Film Ever Made
","Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, 'The Godfather' reigns supreme as number one, while 'City of God,' or more appropriately, 'Cidade de Deus,' is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to 'Crash.' They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, 'City of God' is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and 'The Godfather' has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).Now, 'City of God.' What a rush! Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece is a film to behold. Many critics have described films as 'explosive' for the punch they pack, and/or the unflinching reality of the subject matter. But there has been no film I have ever seen that can match 'City of God' for energy. It has so much energy that instead of unfolding, it throws itself at you all at once, leaving everything else to be done afterwards. The actors don't act; they don't have time. They just...are. Everything is done to such an extreme, it's surprising that Meirelles manages to make none of it sensationalistic or exploitative.Some people will tell you that this film is the chronicle of two drug lords. While there is some truth in that, the plot, if one could call it that, is better described as the chronicle of the 'City of God' itself. Characters float in and out, with the 'out' part frequently involving a bang (or more likely, a series of them). The characters are given background only if and when they are needed.Like I said, there's really no time to develop subtly-nuanced performances. The film moves with such breakneck energy that to do so would only slow it down. There are only a few characters that really matter. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is our window into the hellish slums. The result isn't voyeuristic, instead Rocket is more like a guide (albeit with only the narration addressing the audience). He's a normal teen, with interests in girls (particularly Angelica (Alice Braga)), sex, and aspirations to be a photographer. But his main goal is simply to survive each day. Also of note is Li' Ze, who we see growing up with a taste for violence as a kid (kids shoot and kill people just as frequently, if not more so, than adults). His increasingly drug-addled brain and his ambition makes him more frightening by the minute. The only one who keeps him grounded and (relatively) under control is Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), the 'coolest hood in the City of God.' There's some truth in that statement, as spoken by Rocket. He's the shed of brightness in this hellish city (though he's no goody-two-shoes). Finally, there is Lil Ze's rival, Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who has the film's most notable character changes.But this is Fernando Meirelles movie. He throws in everything he can think of, and then some. References to Tarantino are abound, and there are probably more, but Meirelles takes the energy level up so high that there's no room for even a 'please' or 'thank you.' Desaturated colors. A constantly moving camera. Loud noises. An upbeat soundtrack (which is the film's saving grace from becoming too grim). It's all here.People may not agree with me that this is the best film ever made, and that's okay. I respect that. But make no mistake, it's an unforgettable 130 minutes.",10,14,24,20 June 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An achingly beautiful love story
","How can one express their thoughts of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in words? The emotions in this film are so complex and deep that words really can't do them justice. But that won't stop me from trying.In a word, this film is beautiful. This is a grand and powerfully emotive film that must be experienced to truly understand. Lovingly crafted and jaw-droppingly beautiful, this is a film where emotions take center stage.Two aging warriors, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) are looking to retire from a life of adventuring and fighting. But the theft of a legendary sword, the Green Destiny, sets in motion events that will unearth buried secrets in them and a young princess, Jiao Long (Zhang ZiYi).The film is famous for its fight scenes, which are as beautiful as they say. This isn't a particularly violent film, at least not in the way of say, Jet Li. Or even Jackie Chan. The action sequences are almost completely bloodless (a wise concession from reality), and they are performed with such grace and beauty that they are far closer to dancing than violence.While there is plenty of swordplay, calling 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' an action movie is an inept and unfair description. Above all, this is a romance; the fight scenes are just an extension of the character's feelings. In their own way, each of the central characters is trapped between their emotions and their lives, and the times where their feelings are brought to the surface, we can see the intensity reflected in their movements.For a film that depends so much on the abilities of the actors, the performances were completely ignored by the major awards. This blunder was tremendous oversight. The actors playing the three central characters deserved Oscar attention, which none of them received.Chow Yun Fat became famous as an action star in John Woo's films, but the Hong Kong star has tremendous acting ability. Li Mu Bai is a weary but wise man who is bound by his sense of duty, but the skill of this new opponent intrigues him, and instead of punishing the criminal, he wants to train her and give her direction. Michelle Yeoh also has a background in action films, but her performance equals that of Chow Yun Fat. She's his lifelong companion, tied by their past. But their duties deny them the ability to really say how they feel about each other. Zhang ZiYi is outstanding in her second screen performance. She's a young girl who has learned the ways of the Wudan martial arts (which Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien are trained in), but as Li Mu Bai puts it, she knows the moves, but not the meaning. Trapped in an impending forced marriage, she is seduced by the freedoms that, she thinks, warriors like Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien have, and runs away. But by the time she learns the hard truth, it may already be too late. Supporting roles by Chen Chang, as Jiao Long's true love, and Cheng Pei Pei, as her governess supplement the material well.Ang Lee is a masterful filmmaker. Even his films that aren't quite perfect are still well made. Lee has made a number of brilliant films, like 'Eat Drink Man Woman' and the slightly overrated but still wonderful 'Brokeback Mountain' (for which he finally won a much deserved Best Director Oscar), this is his best film. This is a film about romance and philosophy more than action, and Lee understands this. It's gorgeously filmed, and he place character and emotion above action. Character, not plot, drives the film.This film was denied the Best Picture Oscar at the 2001 Academy Awards. This was a grave injustice, and the fact that it lost to the bloated and hilariously self-important 'Gladiator' is insulting. Nevertheless, those who see the film will understand that its best defense its itself.",10,0,1,28 April 2010
Amadeus," As big and dramatic as anything Mozart ever came up with
","Music, especially that of the classical variety, is capable of both great bombast and startling subtlety. So is 'Amadeus.' The film has such a grandiose scale that it is surprising to find that director Milos Forman has time to bring out the subtle nuances in the story. It's not quite perfect, and maybe a tad long (at least the director's cut is), but 'Amadeus' is a wonderful film.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a pious composer with minimal talent, is a huge fan of the hottest thing in 18th century music: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salieri loves the music, and is eager to meet the new genius...that is, until he meets him. Meeting Mozart is the ultimate slap in the face. Mozart is like the modern day celebrity stereotype: a hard partying, hard drinking, conceited jerk who chases anything in a dress. Salieri is so enraged that a man like this was blessed with so much talent, while he, a man who is making music for God, has so little. So Salieri begins orchestrating Mozart's downfall...This is not a true story, and it wisely never claims to be. Playwright Peter Schaffer took a rumor whose credibility is, at best, tenuous, and created a whole new story with characters that indeed lived. The filmmakers have taken the mantra, 'never let the facts get in the way of a good story' to heart.The film is splendidly acted. F. Murray Abraham is nothing short of brilliant as the tortured Salieri. Here is a man who has given everything to write music in praise of God, only to have the promised talent go to a man who is so spoiled and crude. That would drive anyone mad. For his part, Tom Hulce makes a cartoonish character into a surprisingly three-dimensional individual, to the point where he becomes...dare I say it? Sympathetic. Elizabeth Berridge is also good as Constanze, Mozart's wife. She loves her husband, although she has a greater intuition about who his friends and enemies are. Jeffrey Jones is surprisingly good as Emperor Joseph II, the idiot king of Austria (he criticizes one of Mozart's operas for 'having too many notes').Director Milos Forman is a terrific director. I liked 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' and based on this, I'm going to forgive him for 'Goya's Ghosts.' Forman has an eye for period detail, and we are fully transported back into the time of Mozart. It's not just how everything looks, but how people act. Sitting in chairs in the opera house, fire swallowers on the streets, etc. The only flaw is that Mozart's madness is told, but why it happens is not adequately explained.'Amadeus' is a wonderful film, plain and simple.My rating: PG for brief nudity.",9,1,2,29 March 2010
The Game," Hitchcock would be proud.
","The best thrillers have two things: growing tension and an unpredictable plot. David Fincher's masterpiece has that, and something that few thrillers, even the best ones, have: the belief that anything can happen at any time. Quite frankly, this is one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a millionaire who's life is perfect. He's fabulously wealthy, and although he's divorced, his ex-wife still calls him on his birthday. A day late, his deadbeat brother Conrad (Sean Penn) shows up and hands him a birthday present: an invitation to participate in a game offered by Consumer Recreation Services.More than that, I cannot and will not say. Let me just say this: never let your guard down while watching this movie. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, or when you think Nick is safe (for the time being), the film pulls a fast one, and everything you thought you knew changed. It's a one-of-a-kind experience when a thriller is so skillfully put together that you can't rely on the thriller to stay on the traditional rhythm.From an acting standpoint, the only performance that really matters is Michael Douglas; everyone else is strictly supporting. Douglas is a master at playing cold, hard, ruthless businessmen, and Nicholas Van Orton is right up his alley. Connections to Gordon Gekko are eerily similar, except that Nick is sympathetic, while Gekko was deliciously villainous. Support is ably provided by Sean Penn, and character actors Deborah Kara Unger and James Rebhorn. All are perfectly cast, although Sean Penn is especially interesting; we really believe that Conrad and Nick are brothers. The film's handling of the villain, Consumer Recreation Services, is brilliant. Faceless, non-speaking villains are difficult to pull off effectively, but when they work, they are frightening. We never know what to expect from CRS, or when.The real star of 'The Game,' however, is David Fincher. With every film, the former music video director gets better every time. Although I liked 'Seven,' it doesn't hold a candle to this one. This is Hitchcock for the 90's. It is perfectly paced, and the suspense rarely lets up.Don't miss it!",10,0,2,28 December 2009
Kick-Ass," Fun superhero movie
","People have been saying that 'Kick-Ass' turns the superhero genre on its ear. While it's true that the set-up adds a certain level of verisimilitude to the film, the need to have a story turns it into just another superhero origin story, save for a few throw-away lines and gags to make it more real. That doesn't mean it isn't fun, however.Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is your normal teenager. He's a comic book lover, but that's about as far as he goes in terms of being out of the ordinary. He's so normal that he's just about invisible. One day he starts wondering why no one has donned a costume and become a superhero. If you really think about it, it really shouldn't take much. So Dave buys a wetsuit and becomes Kick-Ass. Before long, he becomes a phenomenon, inspiring a father/daughter team (Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz), and attracting the attention of a wealthy drug kingpin (Mark Strong).The best thing that the movie has is its realism. 'Kick-Ass' tries to be as realistic as possible in terms of what would happen if a normal kid tried vigilantism. It's not a pretty sight. Dave isn't invincible, and neither are any of the other superheroes; when someone gets hit, it hurts...a lot! However, I didn't think it went far enough. I mean, wouldn't the police be able to track him down with forensic science? That would lead to some interesting complications.Nevertheless, it's still a lot of fun. All the actors perform in an understated way. I often criticize movies for doing this, but it works here. Aaron Johnson makes for a good pubescent superhero. His voice frequently cracks, and so on. But Johnson is a good performer. Nicholas Cage is a little off-the-wall (as Cage is wont to do), but the understated way of acting keeps him restrained enough from doing anything too outlandish. Mark Strong makes for a surprisingly good villain. And Christopher Mintz-Plasse does what you'd expect him to: he's like Foegel in 'Superbad' (his star-making role), only a lot less geeky and oblivious.There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this film, and a lot of that has to do with Chloe Moretz, who plays Mindy, aka 'Hit Girl' (quite well, by the way). People were shocked at the profanity she utters. Nothing was said about the people she kills (a number so high that it would make Ah-nuld blush). Conservatives are always complaining about how we've lost our moral values. They should check this movie out, and then see which is more disturbing.This movie is a lot of fun (adults only...the film actually gets the rating it deserves, for once). Nothing is taken too seriously, yet it's never too cheeky, either. However, character development is a little too low for the film to work completely. Dave is in over his head from day one, and he knows it. But he needs more development for us to really feel it. And while the film doesn't completely break the mold of the superhero genre, that doesn't mean it's not a good movie anyway.",8,1,8,10 May 2010
Ghostbusters," A classic
","Granted, this isn't a film with pretentious drama or self-importance. And it's a film with belly laughs instead of subconscious amusement. But it is a classic in the same way that 'Casablanca' and 'Lawrence of Arabia' are. It is one of Hollwood's most successful comedies, and for good reason: it's a very funny and spooky movie.The plot is pretty simple: After getting fired from their university, three scientists, Drs. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) go into business for themselves catching ghosts. They soon get more than they bargained for when a demi-god tries to move in and destroy the world.Murray. Akroyd. Ramis. Two are SNL alumni and all are regarded as some of the great comic geniuses of our time. Murray has been leaning more towards drama these days (and Wes Anderson's piles of crap), Akroyd's career has come to a bit of a stand still and generally relegated to cameos, and Ramis has taken to directing films. All three are gifted comedians, and this is a representation of their best work. Murray is terrific as the sarcastic and egotistic jerk, Akroyd is hilarious as the energetic nerd, and Ramis is just as good as the anti-social nerd. Also in the cast are Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, the skeptical musician who becomes their first client, and the target of Venkman's charms, Rick Moranis, Dana's nerdy neighbor who is so nerdy that he puts Stantz and Spengler to shame, and Ernie Hudson is great as the new recruit. And of course William Atherton is on hand to be the nosy asshole (which he does with great ability).Ivan Reitman was the go-to guy of comedies throughout the 80's and mid-90s. His style is professional, but solid, and he knows how to make a movie funny. 'Ghostbusters' is easily his best film. It's funny, but also spooky. There are a few chilling moments in the film, particularly towards the end.There isn't anyone alive who won't have a great time watching 'Ghostbusters.'",10,1,2,16 January 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A Magical Epic
","It's no surprise that this movie came out during Oscar season. Everything about it just screams 'Academy Awards.' The rhythmic, but not too wordy, dialogue, the epic scale, the unfolding storyline, this one's got it all. I've criticized a few movies for being manufactured to be Oscar darlings. While I won't deny that that's probably what happened with 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,' but this is much better because it doesn't SEEM like it.'I was born under extraordinary circumstances...' Had this movie been a megahit (and perhaps it will, having been freed of the shadow cast by the indie-favorite Best Picture winner 'Slumdog Millionaire'), these words would be as iconic as 'I'm king of the world!' Still, that's the best place to start the description of the movie. It's also the best place to end it. This is one of those movies that's all about the premise, and what the filmmakers do with it. Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) was born an old man, and grows younger by the day. It's a fascinating premise, and the filmmakers do everything that can be done with it.The acting is terrific. I've never been a Brad Pitt fan, and the tabloid obsession with him and Angelina Jolie makes me like him even less. But this has got to be his best performance. He's reflective, and ably portrays such an unusual character. There's no sense of showboating, or that he's 'acting.' We don't see Brad Pitt as Benjamin, we simply see Benjamin. Cate Blanchett is a goddess among actresses. Except for perhaps Meryl Streep, I can't think of anyone who can match her versatility. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that Blanchett would be terrific as Benjamin's lover Daisy, and Blanchett delivers. Taraji P. Henson is solid as Queenie, and while I wouldn't have been one to demand that she get nominated, I'm not going to complain. Tilda Swinton is underused as Elizabeth Abbott, the woman with whom Benjamin has his first fling, but it's not a very important part. A movie like this is filled with bit parts by unknowns. But for me, one of them really struck me. That is Jared Harris, who plays Captain Mike. While he may be a drunk, Captain Mike is really the one who teaches Benjamin the most about life. He's a likable character who really resonates with the viewer (not to mention Benjamin).Acting aside, this film belongs to David Fincher. Known mainly for his visual style, Fincher has gradually become known for other aspects of directing. The tone changes throughout the film, but Fincher knows this. It goes from magical to dramatic to a conclusion with pathos. Fincher has complete control over it.However, Fincher has not lost his ability to create awe-inspiring visuals. From the dream-like cinematography to the jaw-dropping visual effects (like the aging on the young Benjamin), they are amazing.One thing of note is that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett looped their voices over those of their younger counterparts (though the actors adjust their voices accordingly). It creates a distance between the movement of the mouth and the timing of the audio. Some people may think that this is a mistake, but I liked it. It creates an otherworldly feel to it.Do yourself a favor, see 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.' You won't be disappointed.",9,3,5,21 May 2009
Transformers," Dumb first half, fun second half
","While no one will mistake Michael Bay for making something intelligent or well-acted, they were at least watchable the whole way through. But Bay, the God of summer action movies' (Jerry Bruckheimer) favorite director, has made his weakest film yet. The first half of the movie is so dumb it's nearly unwatchable (maybe its because Bruckheimer isn't producing...). The dialogue is bad, the characters do stupid things, and stuff sometimes just doesn't make sense. Fortunately, however, the movie gets better around the 45 minute mark. It's not smarter, but it's actually entertaining. This is especially crazy since Steven Spielberg is an executive producer. Then again, he 'sold out' a while ago, and is now more of a producer than a director.The story is completely absurd, but hey, it's a sci-fi movie, so of course it's going to be. Anyway, there are two warring alien races who are machines, the Autobots (the good guys) and the Decepticons (the bad guys). They bring their battle to earth because there's an all-powerful box called the Allspark there, and it could either bring peace, or destroy humanity and give the Decepticons control of the universe.The acting is okay, I guess, but no one is developed at all. Half the people are only memorable because we know their faces from other movies. Shia LeBeouf is immensely likable, so we care about seeing him through the movie. He's no different here than in any other movie he's been in, but he has an irresistible charm that does the job. Surprisingly, Megan Fox is not around just for good looks. She can act, and nearly steals every scene she's in. Jon Voight is awful, however. It's one of the worst performances he's ever given. Josh Duhamel is adequate, but not memorable. Jon Turturro is fun to watch as the of-the-wall secret agent. Tyrese Gibson is completely wasted in this movie.I really hate the Shaky Cam technique. For those of you who don't know, it's where the camera moves around a lot during an action scene so you can't get a good look at what's going on. Used effectively, it can heighten the suspense. 'The Descent' is a case in point. The technique heightened the claustrophobia because it heightened the sense of being trapped in the dark and fighting monsters the characters couldn't see. But in 'Transformers,' there's no use for it. Michael Bay used it probably because it is the trend, and, taking a note from Jerry Bruckheimer, he's never one to pass up on something that has already made money before.However, Bay is not a versatile director. He's good for filming action scenes, but not much else. He can't keep the material straight, and that's a problem because there are a lot of things going on simultaneously. With Bay's inadequate direction, characters come and go as the story demands it, and the rules that the film established are broken repeatedly and new ones are made. It's a mess.However, I'd be lying if I said 'Transformers' is a terrible movie. It's no masterpiece (it's not even especially good). But it's watchable.Will I see the sequel? I guess, if I have nothing better to do. Because the film left me with that thought, I'll be generous with its rating.",6,0,1,11 June 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Well done, but it's been done before
","Million Dollar Baby is a tired story done well. Everything here has been seen before, apart from the last 20 minutes. What makes it different is that everything is done well. The acting is spectacular all around, in fact, it's easy to forget that it's all been done before (though Morgan Freeman's role is too short for Oscar worthiness. Not that it means he didn't deserve the statue.). Clint Eastwood gets every effect and emotion that he can out of every frame. Paul Haggis's screenplay uses the simple grit of everyday life poetically. While there is a very familiar storyline, the plot elements have been used in ways that make them seem fresh. I mentioned that the last 20 minutes is different than what has been seen before. This is true, and I do not want to give anything away. But the rest of the film leaves such an impression that what originality is left has been tainted. Is this an Oscar worthy picture? Perhaps, for the acting and the directing and the writing. But not Best Picture.",6,1,3,3 July 2006
Event Horizon," Mediocre first half, creepy second half
","'Event Horizon' is still working itself out when it starts. It doesn't iron out all the kinks until the movie is half-over. The first half tries, but fails, to be creepy. However, once it finds its rhythm, 'Event Horizon' is VERY creepy.About 50 years into the future, a research vessel called the Event Horizon just disappears. No contact, no trace of what happened or where it went. Seven years later, it reappears, and a rescue crew is sent to investigate. Tagging along is the ship's creator, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill). Once they get there, strange things start happening...The biggest problem with 'Event Horizon' is that the first half just isn't creepy. Paul W. S. Anderson (not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson or the guy-who-shouldn't-be-making-films Wes Anderson) tries to create tension, but at first, the 'creepy' goings on aren't, well, creepy. There's no sense of danger, and it's surprising that the actors (specifically Kathleen Quinlan in one scene) seem as spooked as they are. Therefore, the film has to rely on atmosphere to generate tension. While I'm not saying that the 'Event Horizon' isn't a creepy place from the get-go (it is), it's just not creepy enough.This shouldn't be construed to mean that the first hour of the film is boring. While it may not get the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up, it's always interesting. The ship is just begging to be explored, and the question of what happened to the ship (and its crew) is always one everyone's mind.Acting is stronger here than it usually is for this kind of a movie. Laurence Fishburne has a commanding presence as the rescue ship's captain. This was a thinly written character, but Fishburne makes a character out of him. Sam Neill is wasted for the first half, but he becomes a lot better when he has something to do. Joely Richardson doesn't get to do much in terms of character, but she doesn't blow it. Jason Issacs, one of my favorite actors waiting for their big break, creates a dark, but amiable person as DJ. Richard T. Jones (who provides some comic relief), Jack Noseworthy and Sean Pertwee round out the cast with solid, if unmemorable, performances.Director Paul W.S. Anderson has a lot of control over his material, but he makes some blunders as well. His sense of atmosphere needs fine tuning, but even in a movie like this, he has great control of his actors. He can't always create tension, but he always has the audience's interest. This is a solid offering from the man who would later bring us the Resident Evil movies.The special effects vary as well. Granted, this movie was made over a decade ago, but even then some of them could have been better worked out. The explosions look nice, the gore doesn't look fake, and the big effects shots (like of the whole ship) are very real and meticulously detailed. However, the little things don't fare as well. For example, the objects that fly across the room in zero gravity are obviously computer generated, and the computers look as if they were made before 'Alien' (in production time, not the setting).I know I've been rather vague, and for that I apologize. But I'd still recommend 'Event Horizon.' It's not perfect, but it's not a very bad way to waste a good hour and a half.",7,0,1,17 May 2009
Grave of the Fireflies," Very Sad Movie...
","This is a very sad story. Two orphans, teenager Seita (J. Robert Spencer) and his toddler sister, Satsuke (Rhoda Chrosite) must survive on their own at the end of WWII. It doesn't get much sadder than this.Japan, 1945. The war is nearly over, and Japan is being pummeled by constant air raids by the Americans. After the death of their mother, Seita and Satsuke must find a way to survive (their father is away in the Navy).The film is strongly reminiscent of Cinderella and 'Life Is Beautiful.' The former because the two siblings go to live with a distant aunt at first, but leave because she is cruel. The latter is because of the relationship between Seita and Satsuke. Seita tries to keep his younger sister from experiencing the trauma of their situation. Therefore he tries to make everything fun and exciting for her.One of the notable qualities about the best anime is that the dubbed voices are always good. Miyazaki's films have it, but unfortunately, this one doesn't. The only voice that works is J. Robert Spencer. This is a guy we can all love; if everyone had an older brother like this, we'd all be very happy. He's very nice and pleasant towards Satsuke, to the point where it almost becomes unfair. Rhoda Chrosite is not successful though. It sounds as if a 30 had imitated a four year old, and instead of tearing at our heart, it becomes annoying. Amy Jones has stilted delivery as the aunt, but she's okay.Although this is a very sad movie, it lacks the real emotional punch that many of the best tragedies have. This is not a tearjerker, however, and calling it that would do the film a great disservice. It's a good film that should be seen, but it is not always easy going.",8,1,2,13 April 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," B-movie leaves something to be desired
","Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are Hollywood's bad boys. The two of them completely flaunt Hollywood conventions, doing what pretty much whatever they want. The two filmmakers have very similar styles, and a co-operative production between the two became inevitable. Unfortunately, their first combined effort is something of a disappointment.Two bank robbing brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gekko (QT himself) are fleeing to Mexico to live a life of luxury. Along the way, they hijack an RV driven by Jacob Fuller, an ex-priest, and his son (Ernest Liu) and daughter (Juliette Lewis). Stopping to meet up with their cohorts at a bar, they discover that the bar is actually run by a group of nasty vampires.The problem with the film is that it takes a while to get going. Clooney is fun to watch, but this isn't the likable criminal that he usually plays. He's a violent thug, and 'charm' is not something one would use to describe his character. QT however, is ineffective as Richard. He can be a genius filmmaker when he wants to be, but he can't act. Harvey Keitel is solid as the priest who lost his faith. Juliette Lewis is miscast, and the less said about Ernest Liu, the better (he's awful, if you must know).Robert Rodriguez is trying to emulate the B-grade zombie/vampire horror shlock films that he and QT love, and while it's certainly bloody, cheesy and sleazy, it's also a little boring. When the film gets going, it doesn't stop until the end. But it takes a little too long to get there.",6,0,0,11 March 2010
Clash of the Titans," Cool to look at, but that's about it
","In the old days of Hollywood, the spectacle was a grand, rousing story filled with enormous battles, a dastardly villain and a hero that everyone could get behind. Nowadays, it's grand and enormous, but it fails to really be rousing and draw us into the story because there's no one to really care about.'Clash of the Titans' takes place in a time of gods and man, of heroes and myths. Zeus (Liam Neeson) created man so their continued prayers could give the gods immortality. The problem is that the gods are screwing the humans over, and they're sick of it. When the citizens of Argos destroy a statue of Zeus, Zeus allows his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to get the humans respecting them again by any means he sees fit. Hades gives the King of Argos an ultimatum: either sacrifice his daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), or have his city destroyed by the Kraken. But while Hades has his own plans set it motion, the gods watch nervously as Perseus (Sam Worthington), the mortal son of Zeus, journeys to find a way to defeat the Kraken and save both Argos and Andromeda.The film, an update of the notoriously cheesy 1981 original, is loaded with special effects. For that part of the film, it works. Visually, the film is meticulously detailed and always cool to look at. Even better is the fact that we can actually see the action scenes. Louis Leterrier does not use the shaky cam to obscure what happens in the fight scenes, and apart from a few minor missteps in the beginning, the action scenes are clear and easy to follow.Unfortunately, the acting department is where it fails. It's not that the actors are bad, it's just they're all the same: gruff, growly and brooding. Had there been a little time for character development, this could have been a worthy successor to 'Lord of the Rings' (in fact, there are scenes where it is trying to be). Alas, it's just all glitz and flashy visuals.Maybe it's just me, but I think if a human being is ripped in half or decapitated (regardless of the amount of blood shown), I think that deserves an automatic R rating. Had the roughly 10 seconds of footage been edited out or redone, this would be a bona-fide PG-13 movie. But as it is, it should have been rated R. Likewise, the images of some of the breasted creatures were covered up, despite being uncovered in the drawings from Ancient Greece. Go figure.My rating: rated R for fantasy action/violence throughout including some intense images, and brief language.",7,0,1,3 August 2010
Paranormal Activity," What you can't see is always scarier than what you can
","In his review of 'The Blair Witch Project,' Roger Ebert said, 'The noise in the dark is almost always scarier than what makes the noise in the dark.' Indeed, that film terrified audiences 11 years ago by exploiting that fact. Now, Oren Peli has taken the same concept, and made a similar horror flick. And 'Paranormal Activity' is a hell of a lot scarier.Katie and Micah are two roommates who are witnessing some strange occurrences in their home. They decide to buy a video camera to record these occurrences, and that's when the film begins.Plot is of little matter here. Neither are special effects. The camera is hand-held, but usually it is on a stand or resting (thank God). The actors are very real, which is the point. It doesn't take long before we believe that this is actual footage.The construction of the film is genius. The occurrences are what in other contexts would be normal sounds, but without a visible source, they become frightening. But what really gets us is that many times we are unsure that anything happened at all. Oren Peli is a genius for making this all work so well. One could divide the film in three parts: slow, creepy then downright scary.It's not perfect (the beginning isn't very effective, and initially the possible explanations seem downright silly, although once the film gets going, that all changes). However I'm giving it a 10 because it actually scares the hell out of us extremely well, and the tension builds to an ultimate crescendo. And the climax (the original...the alternate ending is pretty weak) is downright terrifying.This is one film that goes beyond thrills and crosses the line into utter fear.",10,35,69,13 January 2010
Into the Wild," Insightful and gorgeously filmed
","Nearly everyone goes through a time where they are resentful towards their parents, feeling them to be over-protective, inattentive, or that they simply don't understand their kids. Christopher McCandless was no different, but he took his rebellion to an extreme.Director Sean Penn wants the viewer to identify with McCandless in this way, but his rebellion is so extreme that while he may be likable enough for the viewer to find him sympathetic, it is difficult to empathize with him. This hurts the romanticized sense of adventure that the movie wants to fill the viewer with, which is already hindered if one knows the ending (which most people probably already do).For Chris, this 'Alaskan Adventure' is an escape, an escape from the wrongs he finds with normal civilization. More importantly, it's an escape from being trapped with parents who fight all the time, and are living lies that they hide from him and his sister. This feeling of being trapped is something that most people can relate to, but his conflicts with his parents are not developed enough to make as much of an impact as Penn probably intended. Still, we are able to understand Chris's motives. His frustration (and thirst for adventure) are enough to make him leave everything behind and live a life of complete freedom. But not until it's too late does Chris realize that he's pretty naiive and doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. This is a problem (in a general way) that many teenagers face. They feel so trapped by their parents and their desire to run their kid's lives that sometimes the teenagers rebel, but their desire for escapism can blind them to some unforeseen consequences. Such is what happens to Christopher McCandless.The performances are great. Emile Hirsch, who gave a solid performance in 'Alpha Dog,' is even better here. He's beginning to show that in the near future that he's going to be a force to be reckoned with. It's a challenge to play someone who is so voluntarily 'not normal,' but every note of Chris's stubborn desire for freedom rings true. The supporting characters are great as well. Hal Holbrook may have gotten the Oscar nomination, but the performance that I thought was the best was Catherine Keener's Jan Burres. Judging by the Academy's love of conflicted, tragic individuals, it's easy to understand why Holbrook was nominated, but the reality of it is that Hirsch equals him).Sean Penn is a great director. His use of nature images enhances the setting and the tone of the film. And they're amazing to look at. Another film that came out around the same time was 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.' Both films were epic in scale and used plenty of gorgeous cinematography. While the latter was slow moving, 'Into the Wild' is not. With a running time of nearly three hours, it may be easy to assume that this is a very slow moving film, and probably overlong. Not so. The film moves along pretty quickly, yet everything is pretty developed (except the part with Sonja and Mads, but they weren't that important anyway. That and the amount of time they interacted was short anyway, at least as the movie intended).Still, even with its flaws, 'Into the Wild' is still a great movie. Definitely worth a watch.",7,2,5,23 March 2008
Blood Diamond," A Perfect Movie
","'Blood Diamond' works in the two most lucrative ways: both as a powerful film that the Oscars love, and a summer action/adventure film. It is both of these at the same time for its nearly two-and-a-half hour running length. Despite its length, it is always fully engaging and NEVER boring.The best way to classify this movie is as an epic, though not in the same sense as say, 'Braveheart' or 'Lawrence of Arabia.' It has wide epic scale, fully realized characters, a thoroughly compelling plot and thrilling action. I don't think there is a person alive who wouldn't find something to appreciate in 'Blood Diamond.'1999. Sierra Leone is in the midst of a brutal civil war. Both the government and the rebel RUF are battling for the control of the diamond trade. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) has found a giant, priceless diamond, and just before he is captured, he hides it. A smuggler named Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) finds out about it, and promises to help him find his son if Vandy shows him where he hid it. Along for the ride is journalist Maddie Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), who also wants to write the story of how one company makes money off the war.The film features two brilliant performances. Leonardo DiCaprio has long since left his 'Titanic'-era heartthrob days behind him, and continues to impress as a serious thespian. This is his best performance yet. Danny Archer is a familiar character, but DiCaprio does enough with him to make him unique. He doesn't like having to help Solomon, but he knows he doesn't have much choice. The same goes for Maddie Bowen, as he is reluctant to give her information, but he has to in order to use the resources that she has. Matching him is Djimon Hounsou, who continues to astound with his mostly unrecognized acting abilities. Solomon Vandy is a desperate man, but he will not let someone push him around, even if they are pointing a gun in his face. To him, the diamond is nothing. All that matters is getting his family back. Hounsou uses his capacity for power and strength to portray a man who is so desperate that he becomes fearless. Jennifer Connelly may have a less showy role, but she does enough with it that it avoids becoming a cliché.This is clearly a movie for Edward Zwick. He's no stranger to this kind of film, and he knows exactly what to do with it. He treats the material with respect, and gets his point across, but he knows that people go to the movies to be entertained, and he balances that perfectly. 'Blood Diamond' has a lot to say, but Zwick keeps things movie at a brisk pace. This is his best film yet, and I am eager to see what the future has in store for him.Typically, musical scores are a small part of a film, but nevertheless a film wouldn't be the same without them (or in some cases, with them). Here, the score plays a big part in the film's success. It's not that its noticeable, or anything special (you're not likely to come out humming its main theme, if it even has one). But it perfectly sets to tone. Without the viewer really noticing it, the music changes the film's tone from something serious and hard-hitting to something more alive and adventurous. James Newton Howard's score is brilliant in how it accomplishes this, because if the film had a different score, it would feel a lot different.'Blood Diamond' is the perfect movie. Sure, a lot of the stuff is familiar, but there's a lot of new stuff as well, and the filmmakers and actors do enough to make it all seem fresh. This is one of the best films of 2006, and one of my all-time favorites.",10,1,2,14 January 2009
Taken," Original and unpredictable
","Let's see...it's a big budget movie, so it has to be based on a comic of some kind. No? Well, then a book maybe. Not that either? Sequel then? Perhaps a remake. Wow, wrong again. Well then it has to repeatedly rip off something else. Wow. Am I dreaming? 'Taken' is probably the first big-budget action movie that is neither based on anything else or ripped off another movie or a TV show. Given how tired I am of comic books and other media being turned into movies I would have been more than willing to look the other way for having stolen bits from other movies, but no. Pierre Morel's 2008 film is completely original. I guess it helps that it was co-written by Luc Besson, an action-film director, but never mind. It's a pity it wasn't better.Okay, fine. 'Taken' is actually pretty good. It's unpredictable, and it doesn't follow a strict formula. More importantly, it kept my attention. But it didn't get my adrenaline pumping, which is the main reason why a person would see a movie like this.Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is an ex-CIA guy who retired to spend more time with his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Unfortunately, his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) divorced him soon after. Now retired, Bryan has nothing better to do than to protect pop superstars (Holly Valance) and drive his ex-wife and daughter nuts with his 'paranoid' views on what the world is REALLY like. But Kim and her friend are kidnapped while on a European vacation, Bryan sets out to find her, and woe betide anyone who gets in his way.'Taken' is a revenge thriller and a investigative thriller mixed into one (no, I'm not giving anything away). By nature, these movies are violent and brutal, and this one is no different. There are two words that explain why 'Taken' was given a PG-13 rating instead of the R-rating it deserves: studio clout. I guess the corruption of the MPAA helps, but I think that's the same thing.That being said, 'Taken' has some things going for it. Liam Neeson is one of the better working actors out there today, and although Neeson is known for his protagonistic roles, he has no problem tackling the role of a man who has no qualms about killing anyone who gets in his way. Unfortunately, he's the lone good performance. I think part of the problem is that we don't care about Kim's fate. Part of the reason why is that she's played by Maggie Grace, who's pretty bad. At 26, she's too old for the part, although she tries to capture the same mannerisms and energy of the someone the same age (unfortunately, this makes her look ridiculous). I'm wondering why Famke Janssen took her role. She's a respected actress, but she doesn't have anything to do. The bad guys aren't vicious enough, either, which is another knock down.Cinematographer turned director Pierre Morel has been given his first big chance at directing a major film (his first credit, District 13, was not widely seen in the United States), and he doesn't screw it up. He uses the shaky cam technique (something that I generally hate), but overall, he does it well. Usually it works, although there are times when it makes things confusing.Although 'Taken' lacks the visceral thrill that makes these kinds of movies work, it's still worth a viewing. And you might like it a lot better than I did. The person I watched it with loved it.",7,0,0,1 August 2009
The Mummy Returns," Non-stop action
","The success of 'The Mummy' in 1999 surprised everyone, and on the day that it opened, Universal Studios greenlit another sequel. The original (the 1999 one) was a lot of fun because it mixed creepy scares with awesome action and goofy humor. The sequel does more or less the same thing, except that the action sequences come pretty much one after another from beginning to end.Rick (Brendan Fraser) has married his love from the first film, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and the have a son, Alex (Freddy Boath). After finding the bracelet of the mythical Scorpion King, they're attacked by villains who are intent on raising Imhotep from the dead (again) so he can kill the Scorpion King and take over the world. Of course, it's up to Rick and Evelyn to stop them.All the characters from the first film in the franchise are back, and they slide into their parts easily. Arnold Vosloo gets to do more with his character, and Patricia Velasquez (who has about 10 times as much screen time as she did in the first film) has a lot of fun acting like Jennifer Lopez's alter-ego. There are a few new characters as well, including young Freddie Boath, who is excellent as Alex. His screen appeal rivals Macauley Culkin at his best. Shaun Parkes is a much better source of comic relief than Kevin J. O'Connor (he's consistently funny, and the dialogue between him and Rick or Jonathan is hilarious). Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is suitably creepy as a new villain and Alun Armstrong is suitably kooky as the ringleader.Stephen Sommers knows how to create an action movie. He creates real characters, not actors who are given different names, and sends them into action scene after action scene. It's a fun and exciting flick, and that's all it tries to be.",7,27,29,14 June 2010
Avatar," I'm Speechless
","I first heard about James Cameron's 'Avatar' about three years ago on IMDb, and have been waiting eagerly for it ever since. And now that it's here, I can say that it is definitely worth the wait. 'Avatar' is nothing short of a masterpiece.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is contacted by the US government to help on a mission: On a new planet called Pandora, some very valuable mineral ore has been discovered, but unfortunately, the largest supply is under a tree where an indigenous people, the Na'vi, live. The government, led by Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi, in full-on big biz asshole mode), wants them to relocate, and to that end, they have enlisted the military to help, led by Col. Quaritch (a chillingly evil Stephen Lang). A scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), is researching the planet and teaching the natives in order to find a more diplomatic solution. To do this, she has created avatars, which are Na'vi which humans, like Sully, can control through a machine. But when Sully becomes accepted by the Na'vi, he finds his loyalties tested.This isn't an actors movie, but the performances work. Sam Worthington is effective in a low-key performance, but he's capable of more volatile acting when the situation calls for it. Zoe Saldana is very good in the role of his teacher/love interest. Giovanni Ribisi is terrific as the money-loving jerk, calling to mind his villainous performance in 'Flight of the Phoenix' remake, but he's not creepy here, just a jerk. After seeing him in a few previous performances and in the trailer, I had my doubts about Stephen Lang. I was proved wrong though, Quaritch is a nasty piece of work, and a terrific villain. Sigourney Weaver is good as the somewhat bitchy scientist, but she's still sympathetic.This is James Cameron's show, however. The story may be familiar, but a story is only as good as how well it's told. And 'Avatar' is told brilliantly. Cameron has patience; he knows that the audience is going to be so enamored with visuals that it will be hard for them to concentrate on the story. Cameron allows time for the audience to get used to the visuals before the story really begins, thus two parts of our brain are not battling for control (although the visuals never cease to amaze).The best thing about 'Avatar' is the sense of excitement. Even the most involving action movies don't get the sense of excitement going, at least not to this level. This is an immensely fun and exciting movie, and a must-see.This is an incredible film; I can't stress that enough. And I can't wait to see it again.Note: I didn't really notice the 3D, but maybe it was because I was sitting kind of far back. Oh well, it's worth it either way.",10,42,72,3 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Shock...Another Shock...Another Shock...Another Shock...Get the picture?
","In the past, the concept of a PG-13 horror movie was laughable. Now, it's pretty much all we get. I went into 'Drag Me to Hell' with trepidation because aside from the spooky 'The Ring,' all horror movies with the PG-13 have been universally reviled as complete crap. Then again, this is from Sam Raimi, the creator of the cult classic 'Evil Dead' trilogy, so it should reverse the trend, right? Not really.Although I didn't actively hate it, I didn't like it either. Because the PG-13 rating eliminates most of the trademarks of the genre (extreme violence, sex, gore), the only thing Raimi can rely on is shocks and special effects. There is an overload of the former (even though they 'work', and they get boring after a while, and the special effects are sub-par.Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer at a bank. Because she wants a promotion, she decides not to give an old lady named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) an extension on her mortgage, as this will save the company money. While being a jerk in this case would have had some benefits, it was probably unwise to do it to poor old Mrs. Ganush. Boy can she hold a grudgeThe problem of this movie is that I just didn't care. The acting was okay (though Justin Long was really miscast). I was only interested (a word I use with caution) in the story because I wondered where the story was going. And the special effects looked cheap; with a big budget movie like this, I expected better.About the concept of PG-13 horror movies...as I am not a fan of the genre, I can't really give my opinion. However, I can say that I am against neutering movies to fit the PG-13 rating. In this case, I probably wouldn't have been so annoyed if this wasn't the case with every movie. Based on the past and this movie, I'm guessing that a PG-13 horror movie probably has no real merit, only marketing capabilities. And, unfortunately, the latter is the only thing that matters.",5,8,18,1 June 2009
There's Something About Mary," Gleefully rude, politically incorrect, laugh till it hurts comedy. Any questions?
","This movie is hysterical. That's the bottom line. If you want to laugh, and don't mind severe stomach pain as a result, pop this in the DVD player and enjoy. Admittedly, it's pretty lowbrow, but when so many 'comedies' fail to generate any more than a few chuckles, it's amazing to see a movie that will actually make you laugh (and laugh hard) all the way through.After their prom night was ended too soon after an unholy disaster, Ted Strohmann (Ben Stiller) and Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz) never saw each other again. Now, thirteen years later, Ted is still pining over the woman he loved, and at the advice of a friend, hires a sleazy private investigator to look her up. Once there, he falls for her too. It's a battle of wits, wills, and bodily fluids to determine who gets the girl.Comedy is difficult to pull off. There is so much that has to be perfect to get an honest laugh: timing, reactions, the appropriate build-up, and of course the delivery. The people making this movie certainly have what it takes. This is the best sort of comedy; it's not the lines that provoke laughs (although there are a few good one-liners), it's what happens and how it happens.The talent pool in this movie is terrific. Cameron Diaz is dazzling as the object of every guy's affection. Mary might as well be called Mary Sunshine. She's nice to a fault, and one of those people who can change the tone of a room just by being there. Yet Diaz never lets Mary become two-dimensional. She knows what she wants, but just attracts degenerates, creeps and losers. And it's no feat to understand why every guy would go crazy around her; Diaz is also drop-dead gorgeous.Her co-stars may be losers, but they're funny losers. Ben Stiller is a master of reaction shots, and that serves him well here. Ted is a mixture of guilt and panic, and that sets up some of the film's funniest sequences well. Matt Dillon broke into film playing teenage bad boys, but Dillon proves that he's got considerable comic talent. Lee Evans is pretty funny as Mary's friend who has a secret of his own. W. Earl Brown didn't get any accolades for his spot-on portrayal of Mary's 'retarded' brother, Warren, but he's outstanding. He's funny without being insulting or a walking plot device. Also of note is Keith David, who is hysterical in the one of the film's beginning scenes.The Farrelly Brothers are known for their low-brow, crude comedy, and that's what they give us here. This is a raunchy, occasionally dark, comedy that appeals to the lowest level of humor. And it works. There are quite a few hysterical sequences, and the inbetween parts develop a cute, if preposterous, romance. It also takes chances (a minstrel duo narrating the story? Who've thought?). A little on the long side, but it's funny all the way through. Not for kids or the tightly-wound, but it's got the one thing that every comedy needs: it's funny.",8,0,1,16 January 2010
Up," Solid Pixar movie, but not there with the greats
","Toy Story. Finding Nemo. Wall-E. Based on its pedigree, it is not unreasonable to go into a Pixar movie with high expectations. However, Pixar's newest film is a disappointment compared with its past efforts. That being said, a less-than-expected Pixar movie would not be construed to mean that UP is a bad film. It's good, but not great.Carl Fredrickson (Edward Asner) is a fan of the famed explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). His friend and future wife Ellie, is also a fan. Together, they plan to go to Paradise Falls, just like their hero. However, circumstances prevent them from doing so, and after Ellie's death (and the inevitable future of a nursing home), Carl gets his chance. However, he has an unexpected stowaway: a Wilderness Explorer (think Boy Scouts) named Russell (Jordan Nagai).The film works, I guess, but it's plagued by a number of problems. FIrst and foremost, it has some logical deficiencies. The premise of 'Up,' a senior citizen traveling to South America in his house lifted into the sky via thousands of helium balloons (the size of balloons that one would get at the zoo), requires a sizable suspension of disbelief. I had no problem with that, or with any unbelievable acts associated with it (such as a senior citizen and a boy who couldn't be more than 10 pulling the house by themselves). I did think about them, but I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt. However, I was not able to ignore the film's handling of the villain. I couldn't understand why he did anything that he did in the film (I'm treading carefully to avoid giving away anything). The villain acted in ways to service the story. This severely hurts the film because it runs with the idea that didn't work in the first place.More importantly, it fails to really connect with the viewer. Pixar films like 'Finding Nemo' and 'Toy Story' worked because they established a connection between the viewer and the characters. 'Up' tries, but ultimately fails to do so. The film is all about adventure, but except for one scene, the film failed to get that energy flowing through me.At least the voices are good. Edward Asner makes a good Carl Fredrickson. He acts exactly like a cantankerous old man, complete with the cane and arthritis. However, he does grow a heart. Newcomer Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell. Russell is an energetic young kid, but he has a tendency to talk nonstop. Carl finds him irritating, and the dialogue is hilarious. Christopher Plummer is unrecognizable as Charles Muntz, the famed adventurer, and that's all I'll say. The best vocal work goes to Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog. He's hysterical. If a dog could talk, I'm positive it would sound exactly like Dug.I won't stop you from going to see 'Up.' It's fun, but don't expect another 'Wall-E.'",6,4,11,30 May 2009
From Hell," One of the darkest films that I have ever seen
","'From Hell' takes place in our worst nightmares, a place so dark and scary that even walking around is enough to drive someone mad. This is a very, VERY dark film. It's so dark that it makes 'Seven' look like 'The Wizard of Oz.' Then again, you wouldn't expect a movie based on Jack the Ripper to be light and cheery, now would you?London, 1888. A young prostitute was murdered in the Whitechapel district. The police enlist the help of Fredrick Abberline (Johnny Depp) because of the savagery of the murder and because his opium hallucinations help him solve crimes. But more victims fall, Abberline begins to realize that these murders are connected.The film has a brilliantly dark atmosphere. You know that odd creepy feeling you get when you read about haunted mental asylums, and images of demented doctors performing horrific experiments come to mind? That's what 'From Hell' feels like. It's an unsettling feeling, and the Hughes Brothers are skillful in their employment of this unnerving feeling.The acting is solid, although the film's best hand is the atmosphere. Johnny Depp, who according to his IMDb bio is fascinated by Jack the Ripper, plays things straight (as far as Depp can go in that direction). Heather Graham is also solid as Mary Kelly, the prostitute that Abberline develops feelings for. She speaks with a credible Cockney accent, and tones down the perkiness that she's known for to a very low level. Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane provide good support as well.The problem with the film is the story. Whether it was in the scripting stage or in production, the story is confusing at times, particularly at the end. This is one of those movies where you have to pay attention, or else you will get lost (which is quite possible, considering how strong the atmosphere is).Let me make myself clear: this is a very dark and disturbing film. Most of the violence and gore are left to the imagination (which will be on overkill due to grisly descriptions of the murders), but there is no doubt that this movie deserves as hard of an R rating as can be found. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the blood-phobic.",7,3,4,5 July 2010
National Treasure," Big-Time Fun!
","Film critics are good because they let us know which movies are good (like 'Saving Private Ryan') and which are bad (like 'Norbit'). However, sometimes they take the term 'criticism' a little too much to heart. That's why many claim that critics only like weird art-house movies and trash everything Hollywood puts out. Granted, many of the former are good films that are worth seeing (and some Hollywood movies really are complete crap), but critics sometimes forget who their audience is. Most people who go to the movies just want to sit back, relax and be entertained.No one understands this better than producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Bruckheimer is one of the must successful movie producers alive and whose films have raked in billions. None of his movies have had deep drama, but they all have what the average moviegoer wants: great action and an engaging story. 'National Treasure' is no different.Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) is a man on a mission. He has been handed a clue that has been passed down through generations of his family, and is said to lead to treasure of untold value. But no one has been able to find it, and his family name has been met with ridicule because of it. Now, with the help of his friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and a pretty historian named Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), he's determined to get it. Trouble is, his former partner (and financier), Ian (Sean Bean) is on his trail, and unlike Ben, he's willing to kill to get the the treasure. Oh yeah, the FBI is after him too.Yes, this is all completely silly and ridiculous, and the plot resembles a wall after a gunfight. But the plot holes are so well-camouflaged that you won't find them unless you're actively looking for them, and since the film is so fun and engaging, you won't want to.Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor. He plays Ben in his usual off-the-wall manner, but he imbues the character with such earnestness that it's impossible not to root for him. Justin Bartha provides solid comic relief as Ben's sidekick, Riley, and Diane Kruger is not only beautiful, but also a talented actress; two welcome characteristics for the part of the historian who gets drawn into this treasure hunt. Sean Bean makes for a good villain, and Harvey Keitel is good as the FBI agent on their trail. Brief appearances by Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer are also on hand.Jon Turtletaub keeps things moving at a relentless pace, and that increases the fun and the suspense. Things never slow down for long, and certainly not long enough to really catch your breath. What's surprising is that a movie with this much excitement is entirely suitable for the whole family; few movies can make that claim.It's not great art, but it's not meant to be. This is a really fun movie to watch over and over again.",10,0,2,5 June 2010
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Having your heart and mind in the right place doesn't mean success
","It's kind of ironic that a British filmmaker would direct a film about the Irish Revolution from the point of the Irish. And believe me, director Ken Loach doesn't seem to have any mixed feelings about his countrymen. The British in his film are portrayed as violent 'thugs' who harass and kill Irish civilians as they please, and save for one of them, show no qualms about doing so. This makes it easy for the viewer to side with the Irish protagonists. Unfortunately, that's one of the very few things that the film does right.Damien O'Donnell (Cillian Murphy) is a bright young man about to leave his native Ireland to go to Britain to become a doctor. But his countrymen are struggling against the British forces who are keeping the Irish in check, often violently. So Damien abandons his plans for a future and joins the Irish Republican Army to drive the British out.Ken Loach's vision of the story, from a script by Paul Laverty, is unique. Loach uses a small Irish town as a representation of the whole of Ireland. This isn't a new way of telling a story like this; filmmakers often use characters as symbols of ideas. But Loach's approach is different. These are just ordinary people, not personifications. While that certainly opens the doors for interesting explorations of small-town viewpoints and personalities (something that Loach takes advantage of), it makes it seem like these characters were the only ones fighting the British (something that was obviously not the case). Then again, this is beside the point.'The Wind That Shakes the Barley' does more things wrong than it does right, and that's a shame, because there are some interesting aspects of the film that I haven't seen before (certainly not by any American filmmaker). One of the most interesting things that the film does is look at how nationalism and revolution conflict with small town life. All the principal characters have known each other all their lives, but they're fighting a war where they grew up. If a person betrays you and some of your comrades die because of it, naturally one would want to exact punishment. But what if the traitor is the neighbor down the street who you played sports with and ate dinner with his family? While this conflict is approached and competently explored, that's really the only thing that works (other than the cinematography, which is gorgeous). Loach keeps the characters at an arms distance. That's not necessarily a bad thing (liking the characters is not a requirement of every film, although it is here), but development is. The viewer needs a way into the story, and while Loach tries to make Damien the entry point, it doesn't work. Not because it's hard to identify with a person like Damien, but because Damien is sketchily developed. We never get a sense of who he is, and that makes it hard to identify with him. And sad to say, Damien is the most developed character in the film (the majority of the characters are recognizable only because we've seen them before in earlier scenes--I didn't know the names of anyone besides Damien, his girlfriend Sinead, his brother Teddy, and a few other unimportant characters).But the biggest problem with the film is that it's poorly focused. I think that Ken Loach got a little ahead of himself with this film. He wanted to give rise to a few ideas with the film. That's a good thing, but it doesn't work unless they are well integrated into the story. Loach doesn't accomplish that. For the most part, he tells the story, but some scenes he completely loses sight of the characters and has them play out to serve the points he wants to make. While he can get his ideas across, they lack any effect because they distance us even more from the characters. Halfway through the film I didn't care about anyone.Cillian Murphy started his career as a villain, playing roles such as Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' movies and as Jackson Rippner in Wes Craven's non-horror thriller 'Red Eye.' With the role of Damien, Murphy is venturing into uncharted territory by playing a hero. Many actors do this, but Murphy has a disadvantage: he looks creepy to begin with. Surprisingly, his creepy facial features don't betray him in this role. Damien is a smart guy, but the way his countrymen are being treated at the hands of the British infuriates him, so he decides to fight back. After viewing his performance here, I think Murphy has considerable versatility, and I hope that he gets a chance to play some protagonist roles in the future. Orla Fitzgerald is also solid as Damien's lover, Sinead. She is in the same boat as everyone else, and it's obvious that she would be right beside them fighting if she weren't a woman (this takes place in the 1920's). Nevertheless, she does what she can to help the cause. Padriac Delaney is flat as Dan, however, although he doesn't play an important role until the final 20 minutes.There are a few good things about 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley,' but ultimately its shortcomings turn a potentially powerful film into a long, often tedious, 2 hour slog.",5,2,7,15 August 2009
The Descent," Brilliant
","As any critic will tell you, the rule of thumb is that the more developed a character is, the more you care about what happens to them, which translates into how effective the movie will be. There are exceptions to this rule however (John Carpenter's masterpiece 'Halloween' being a prime example). Some films try to bypass this route and go straight for an all-out action scarefest. This is extremely difficult, and in order to work, everything else has to be pitch-perfect. Neil Marshall has the guts to attempt this ambitious trajectory, and he certainly has the skills to do it.In movies like this, plot is inconsequential; it's just a set-up for the director to go wild and provide a plethora of scares. Basically, a group of women go on a caving expedition after one of them suffered a tragedy the year before (of course). As one can probably guess, nothing goes as planned.It's really pointless to try and address the acting. Apart from two or three of the women, no one really has a well-defined character, and apart from the two I just mentioned, I challenge anyone who watches this to remember anyone else's name. They're all just a bunch of faces and voices. However, the women are normal enough that we care about them simply because we are human, and they're not irritating or dull. They act like real people.This is Neil Marshall's movie through and through, and with this movie, he makes a grand and bombastic entrance into the list of most memorable horror movies. Marshall uses everything at his disposal to maximize the scares and keep the adrenaline pumping throughout most of the 99-minute movie. His camera angles are expertly chosen to get the claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in a cave, and they give a chilling insanity and disorientation to the feel of the movie.It's no secret that this is a monster movie, but what's really interesting is that the monsters don't come until pretty late in the movie. Marshall skillfully sets the mood and gets the adrenaline and uneasiness going by throwing in some realistic situations long before the monsters ever show. I won't give any of them here, but it works.One thing I really liked is that this is a horror-movie through and through. There are no self-referential jokes, no cute pop culture references, or anything like that. In other words, this takes the dark scary route head-on and doesn't follow the trend that the 'Scream' movies started by adding jokes in it (nowadays they're usually added because few people know how to make a movie scary anymore, and the producers want SOMETHING that's definitely going to be marketable in their movie, so they cover two genres with one movie). Marshall makes this a pure heart-pounder and it's so much more refreshing because there's nothing to dilute the scares.Not everything Marshall throws at us works. Some of the non-jolt scares don't work. Additionally, the prelude where we are introduced to the characters is a little long (though that was probably me just eager for the scares to start).With every horror movie, there are always low-grade critics who label every movie with praise like 'scary as hell' and 'terrifying' and the like. Usually, those blurbs aren't worth anything, but here, those are descriptions that I would use any day to describe 'The Descent.' It's a 90+ minute adrenaline rush.",10,1,3,30 May 2008
Titanic," Timeless
","It's bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb's Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about 'Titanic.' The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film's most famous scenes came along, 'Titanic's' reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film's popularity has sunk to where the real ship is.I had fond memories of the film from when it was popular, so I decided to perform an experiment: even after the immense backlash the film suffered, could it still hold up? The answer is a resounding YES!'Titanic' opens when a treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for. Soon after releasing his findings, an elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) claims that it's her in the picture. So Lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamondAs a young woman, she was sailing to America to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage. Planning on ending it all, she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage. Thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began with.The reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted. Leonardo DiCaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world (something he apparently hated), and it's not hard to see why. DiCaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work: he's good-looking and talented (Winslet was honored with an Oscar nomination for her performance, although it's hard to understand why DiCaprio was left out, because he equals her). Jack Dawson is an immensely likable guy. He falls hard for Rose, someone who he knows is clearly out of his league. But he's so immensely likable that we want him to win Rose's heart. His new lover, Rose, is no ordinary society girl, much as she tries. She can't stand the rigidly controlled life she's going to lead, and Jack is her escape. But while she may wear a corset, she's no damsel in distress. She's independent and tough. The romance works because Jack and Rose are meant for each other.Their supporting cast is excellent. The two most important supporting characters are Rose's fiancée, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Cal Hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face. He comes from a wealthy family, and will do anything to get what he wants. He demands obedience from Rose, something she will not give (to anyone, much less Cal). Her mother, Ruth, is just as snobbish and cruel, but she's also desperate. Their family was left virtually penniless, and she's trying to save face. As cruel and despicable as they are, neither one becomes a caricature. Zane and Fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting. Bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash 'new money' Molly Brown.'Titanic' was the most expensive film of the 20th century, and it's clear that every penny was put to good use. 'Epic' doesn't begin to describe this movie. It's huge in spectacle, and the sinking of the ship, which takes up the last half hour, is jaw-dropping. But that's not the only place where the effects were used. We never get a sense that we're looking at sets or CGI; from every frame of the ship, we believe that we are on the ship with the characters. Interesting note: Cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there. But that doesn't stop there. Cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship (and in a way that's plausible.James Cameron has long been considered a god of action movies, but this is the first time his skills were honored. Not only is Cameron a wizard with special effects, he is also a master storyteller. 'Titanic' is a long film (as all epics are), but not one of the 3+ hours of footage is wasted. The film moves, and there is never a dull spot. He knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story, and uses this to his advantage. But the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance, one of the most difficult genres to dabble in, work with immense effectiveness. The romance burns up the screen, so much that we're more concerned with Jack and Rose's fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship. And the scene where Jack draws Rose's picture is potently erotic (especially for a PG-13 movie, which shows not real nudity or sex, but it is strongly implied).I realize that I am not writing this to people who haven't seen the movie (are there such people?). I am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film. I assure you: it's as good as it was the first time you saw it.",10,12,21,6 January 2010
Castle in the Sky," Not Miyazaki's best, but it still contains his trademark magic'
","Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw 'Spirited Away.' I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works is 'Castle in the Sky.' Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as 'Spirited Away' (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek fares best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for 'The Last Picture Show,' but she's annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's so bad it nearly ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.I would definitely recommend seeing 'Castle in the Sky.' I'll probably end up buying it myself. But even though it's not as good as 'Spirited Away,' it's still pretty good.",7,2,4,31 July 2009
Psycho," Truly Terrifying
","If you go on YouTube there are a number of short films that can be viewed from there. 'Psycho' feels like one of those, both in its story and its construction (though 'Psycho' is about 10 times longer than most of the shorts you'd find on the internet). That's part of its charm; it's simplicity gives Hitchcock a lot of room to work with, and really develop every last detail to create its greatest impact. The fact that the film survived almost fifty years (and a remake) proves that all the work paid off.The less said about the story, the better (in fact, the best thing to do is to go into this movie knowing as little information as possible). I will say this: A woman (Marion Crane) has just stolen $40,000 from her boss and skipped town to join her boyfriend, and on the way she stops at a motel.There are two names (of real people) that are always going to be associated with 'Psycho:' Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins (arguably Janet Leigh would also be mentioned, but she doesn't create the impact that the other two do in my opinion). Both of them work wonders here. Hitchcock has created the perfect film; everything works so brilliantly that I can't even find words to describe it. Down to the last detail, Hitchcock meticulously constructed one of the most awesome and terrifying films ever to grace the screen.People may not remember Anthony Perkins' name, but anyone who has heard of 'Psycho' will recognize the name Norman Bates (which is the point of acting, though the opposite is the case in today's world). That is how effective his performance is. I recently watched 'The River Wild,' where Kevin Bacon does a terrific job of portraying a character who is sympathetic in the beginning and a total psychopath later on. Anthony Perkins accomplishes the same thing, and his performance is a lot more effective. At the beginning, he's a young, boyish sort of man who is a motor-mouth at the beginning because he is absolutely smitten with the beautiful woman who has just stopped at his hotel. His charming personality slowly turns to being a frightening one as the movie goes on, and this is accomplished with the same effectiveness. It is especially noteworthy that he does this completely in sync with Hitchcock's direction.The other actors are understandably overshadowed by the Hitchcock and Perkins, but to their credit no one can hold a candle to what they accomplished. Actually, the other performances are very strong. The females are the most successful, especially Vera Miles. Miles is the perfect anchor for the film. She finds a balance between anxiety and determination. Even though she is not given much to work with, she creates a sympathetic sister. Wide-eyed Janet Leigh is also good (though she overacts slightly at times) as Marion Crane, and her scene when she talks to Norman is delicately handled (though even she can't help but be out-shined by Perkins). Martin Balsam brings a noirish feel to his character, but he still fits right in. Like Perkins, John Gavin has a change of character, though he goes from charming to determined instead of psychotic. Gavin makes Sam Loomis easy to sympathize with.James Berardinelli, a film critic that I greatly respect, said that 'Psycho' is not Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film is not his best because it lacks the story and character complexity of 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo,' the latter of which I have not seen. I respectfully disagree. Why? Because it doesn't need them. 'Psycho's' simplicity works to its advantage, and it's clockwork like procession adds a deeper level of fear that a film with more complexity in any area would not be able to create.I often say that 'Halloween' is the scariest movie of all time. Strangely, though, I gave that film an 8/10 and this one a 10/10. The reason is because while 'Halloween' is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen (and in some parts scarier than this one), it is not without flaws. 'Psycho' is flawless and, maybe because it's been a few years since I have seen John Carpenter's film (and a lifetime before I will see it again), more polished. I also said that 'Halloween' creates a high level of suspense with minimal violence, and that is true, but 'Psycho' does it with even less.Earlier in this review I said that it is better to go into this film knowing as little as possible. This is true, though 'Psycho' is so well-known that many people already know a lot about it, especially the ending twist. I was one of those unfortunate souls who knew about it, and while I have to admit that a lot of the impact was lost because of this, Hitchock still delivers the goods well enough to warrant a viewing.'Psycho' was remade shot for shot by Gus van Sant in 1998. It would be interesting to see what difference there is in the two versions (though I've heard the remake is terrible). Still, I'm going to see the remake and be the judge. But maybe I'm making a mistake, for the reported awfulness of the remake may taint the praise I have for the original. That said, nothing, not even 'Halloween,' can hold a candle to 'Psycho.'",10,0,1,24 July 2008
Rosemary's Baby," Polanski's genius
","His criminal record aside, it is obvious that Roman Polanski is a genius director. His ability to set up shots with a specific tone that grows evenly as the film proceeds is extraordinary. That is what makes this film work.'Rosemary's Baby' is a slow burn thriller, one that starts innocently enough, but not exaggerated to the point where it's obvious that the character's lives are about to take a turn for the worse, but ever so gradually the gears start turning and the unsettling feeling starts to build. Polanski is no fool; he doesn't try to create two hours of terror (much like Hollywood does, but can't seem to understand that it has no idea what it's doing), he knows that Levin's story isn't like that. This decision saves the film from obvious doom. Actually, he constructs this film so well, that for a good portion of the film it's hard to believe that this is going to develop into a horror film.Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and Guy (John Cassevetes) Woodhouse are a young married couple who are going to move into a new apartment. The one they pick is located next to the Castevets, a seemingly pleasant elderly couple. Guy takes an instant liking to the Castavets, but Rosemary finds them to be rather nosy, Minnie (Ruth Gordon) in particular. However, shortly after Rosemary gets pregnant, strange things start to happen.The key to the success of any movie is its credibility (I use the word 'credible' with the knowledge that some movies, such as Lord of the Rings, have no use for believability. The audience only has to buy them within its own context). Polanski understands this, and the way he chooses to develop this is not only effective, but completely original. Bad things start to happen when Rosemary takes the advice of the Castevets, if only out of politeness. For example, when Minnie asks her what doctor she is seeing, Minnie insists that she see a different one, one that she trusts. Rosemary is already comfortable with her own doctor, but being polite she takes Minnie's advice (I suppose it helps that the doctor Minnie suggests has a good reputation too, which, in the hands of Polanski and his excellent actors, enhances the credibility instead of making it overkill).The performances are excellent. Mia Farrow and John Cassevetes make a great couple with tremendous chemistry. It's easy to believe that they are a loving husband and wife. The other two principal characters, Minnie and Roman (Sidney Blackmer) are perfect equals to the Woodhouses. They don't develop the Castavets as characters, instead they act like a real elderly retired couple. Ruth Gordon is especially good at this, but perhaps that's because she has a good deal more screen time than her on screen husband. Everyone can see a lot of an elderly retired woman with a lot of time on her hands. Someone who loves to socialize, and is helpful to the point where it is a turnoff to others (though she doesn't realize it). This level of credibility can only come from a talented director and a terrific cast of actors who really care about the project they are working on.I guess for some people, adding the element of 'is she crazy or is this for real' gives a film another level of complexity, and heightens the level of fear. Maybe its because I've seen a number of films like this recently (the beginning of 'The Descent' being one of them), or maybe it's just a personal preference, but I find that being able to put a face on my fear more refreshing (provided it's done well). Nevertheless, this uncertainty is conveyed perfectly, as I can say with absolute truthfulness that until the time that Polanski intended for the truth to come out, I had no idea if Rosemary was crazy or not.Kudos to Polanski for being able to hold everything together for the whole film, at least until the final shot (warning: MAJOR SPOILER ahead). When Rosemary was pressured by Roman Castavet to be a mother to her child (being the newly spawn of Satan), I didn't buy her giving in. Her erratic fear that made up the majority of the film was too potent for that kind of an about face.Still, this is a good little chiller. Not too frightening or disturbing, and except for the aftermath of a 'suicide', there's no real violence or gore to speak of. It's the mark of a superb chiller, one that doesn't use violence and gore to make up for it's lack of ideas and skill.",8,1,1,17 February 2008
Hercules," A step down from previous Disney animated films
","The worst thing you can do when watching Disney's 'Hercules' is to compare it to its predecessors. Not because it's impossible (it's not), but because it makes 'Hercules' look a lot worse than it probably deserves.When it comes to adapting material for children's movies (especially the animated ones), Disney has always been known to change some of the darker aspects of the original story to make it more kid-friendly. Never has it been more apparent than in this film, though considering the source material, it's understandable...to a point. But Disney reworked the whole story, making only passing mentions at the original myth (similar to the fairy tale references to fairy tales in the 'Shrek' movies).Hades (James Woods) is pretty peeved at Zeus (Rip Torn) that he was assigned to govern the underworld. But according to a prophecy, he will have a chance to take over Mount Olympus and rule the world. However, the prophecy also says that there is one person who stands in his way, Zeus' newborn son, Hercules (Josh Keaton/Roger Bart as Young Hercules). So Hades sends his two monster henchmen, Pain (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Panic (Matt Frewer) to off the kid. The plan almost works, and Hercules ends up living as a mortal, though his god-like strength makes him an outcast. Then Zeus tells him that the only way to become a god again is to become a true hero. So with the help of Phil (Danny DeVito), a hero-trainer, Hercules (played by Tate Donovan as an adult), sets out to become one. Meanwhile, Hades has his own agenda in motion.The problem with Hercules isn't the story, but that it's lazy film-making. It seems as though the filmmakers just wanted to make the quickest movie they could. The drama doesn't work very well, the characters are half-developed, and the energy level is low. There are only a few songs in the film (none of which is especially memorable), unlike in previous Disney features. The animation seems to be inspired by Greek art, but it's not as crisp or beautiful as in other films (and sometimes the merging of hand-drawn and computer animation is inadequately done).Most surprising is the lack of effective humor. Much of the jokes fall flat, and what works is merely amusing. The scenery-chewing sarcasm of Woods' Hades and DeVito's Phil are worth a few grins, but they're not laugh-out-loud hilarious.The other voice talents are uninspired. Tate Donovan is flat as Hercules, and he fails to provide the emotional anchor that the film desperately needs. Susan Egan is a good voice-over actress, and her later work in Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' proves it. But her talents are not adequately used here, and it makes her less effective (though she still manages to inject some sass into Meg). Rip Torn does what he can with Zeus, but his dialogue is so weak that there isn't much he can do.'Hercules' is better than 'Pocahontas,' but it's still a far cry from the other Disney features.",8,1,3,28 October 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Are you serious?
","I've heard a lot about 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy.' After all, it made Will Ferrell famous to movie audiences. I've heard it been called everything from just hilarious to being one of the defining comedies of our time. Surprised was I to find out that 'Anchorman' is not only overrated, it's downright unwatchable.Ron Burgandy (Will Ferrell) is Ron Burgandy, San Diego's most famous news reporter with an ego to match. Everything seems to be perfect for Ron, until a new reporter, a beautiful female(!) named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) threatens his seat of power.I've seen a few of Will Ferrell's movies, and I have to admit that I am not a fan. He can be funny, like in 'Elf' or 'Old School.' But here he's so obnoxious that it's torture to watch him 'be funny.' All he does is yell and scream a lot and act like a guy with a big ego. It isn't funny.Everyone here is extremely stupid. That's not inherently a bad thing; being dumb can be funny. Take a look at 'Borat;' they don't get any dumber than that guy. But what makes 'Borat' funny and 'Anchroman' a trial is how it plays dumb. 'Borat' intelligently rips apart the dumbest parts of American culture. 'Anchorman' plays dumb by acting like middle schoolers. What I mean is that 'Anchorman' thinks its being funny by being crude. Crude does not necessarily equal funny. It has to be clever, which 'Anchorman' is definitely not.My God, this is an awful movie. I don't think I've ever had a worse time watching a movie, and that includes 'The Royal Tenenbaums.' That is a record that I hope I never break.",1,23,44,11 January 2009
American Gangster," Great, but its the same schtick
","Like 'Million Dollar Baby,' Ridley Scott's 'American Gangster' is a movie that seems to have been completely constructed to show up at Oscar time. Don't get me wrong, both movies are well done, gritty, and well-acted. The problem is...it's still more of the same.We've seen this movie before. A criminal who is a criminal, despite the fact that he's portrayed with anti-hero sympathy. There's the story of the cop who's trying to catch him, but asking himself why he's doing it at the same time, which runs parallel to the criminal story. Of course, the two main characters don't meet until the end, which is intended to be they climax of the film. Yeah, yeah, we get the picture.I'm guessing the studio is betting on the sad but true fact that the majority of America defines 'The Matrix' as a film classic, and has never had any desire to watch any movie made before 1990. The people who fit this description are going to think this is a brilliant movie and may demand it get a ton of Oscars, blah blah blah. But for people with a wider range of film tastes and experiences will recognize that they've seen this movie before. MANY times.I like Denzel Washington. He's a great actor. But here, he is the exact same person he's always been. It's a good performance, but it's uncannily similar to his other high powered performances, such as 'Training Day.' I can't say the same about Russell Crowe. He's had some good performances, but to be honest I think he's really over-hyped. 'American Gangster' certainly isn't going to change my opinion.See it if you want. Just don't expect the 'American classic' some people make it out to be.",5,1,4,3 February 2008
The Green Mile," Better than the material
","Many films that take place in the deep south have a homey, nostalgic tone to them that feels like you're revisiting faded memories. 'The Green Mile' does that, but even though it has strong performances and solid characterization, the story just doesn't quite work.Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a prison guard on Death Row in a Louisiana Prison. Prisoners come in and stay until it's their turn to die, then more prisoners are moved in to take their place. One day, a prisoner is brought in, just like any other. Only this prisoner, named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), is a towering giant of a man whose size intimidates and shocks everyone there. What's more shocking is the first thing that Coffey says: 'Do you leave the lights on after bedtime? I get kinda scared in the dark.' Slowly, Paul begins to question whether Coffey has indeed killed the two little girls that he was convicted of. But Coffey holds a secret that will change everything that Paul believes in.The acting is very good and the characters are well-developed. Tom Hanks is always good, and he's great as the uncertain Paul, but he's willing to become a believer. Michael Clarke Duncan shines as the hulking gentle giant. The shock of seeing this giant man be so childlike is overcome by his terrific performance. Doug Hutchinson is terrifically vile as the sadistic and spoiled Percy; it doesn't take long for the audience to hate him. David Morse, the late Michael Jeter, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell, Sam Rockwell, Bonnie Hunt and a brief appearance by Patricia Clarkson all provide able support.Darabont's previous film was the similarly themed but inferior (and outlandishly overrated) 'The Shawshank Redemption' (it's good, but belongs nowhere near the IMDb Top 250, much less at the top). Unfortunately, the story goes into sitcom-territory in the final hour, and try as they might, Darabont and his cast can't bridge that problem.'The Green Mile' is wholly watchable, and I don't hesitate to recommend the film. For those in a very undemanding mood and who like this kind of movie, it will probably turn out to be a real winner. Even if you're not in this group (which encompasses a large amount of people), it's still a good film.",7,0,2,21 June 2010
The Reader," Challenging and Provocative
","Ask any number of people to describe an event, and they will all do so slightly differently. This is because each of our experiences and our own personal psychologies influences how we perceive the world. This being the case, then how can justice be truly blind?Michael Berg (David Kross) becomes ill one day, but is helped by a passing woman. Later on, he tracks down the woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and they engage in a passionate affair. After falling in love, Hanna suddenly disappears, leaving Michael stunned and heartbroken. They encounter each other again years later, when Hanna is on trial for murders during the Holocaust (Michael is a law student observing the trial).The film touches on many themes, including command responsibility, the theory versus the actuality of justice, what constitutes morality and others. These are challenging topics, all the more potent when they involve the something as dark and horrible as the Holocaust. It is a credit to the filmmakers that not only are all of these themes and ideas presented intelligently and in ways that stir our minds, but they never make the film exploitative.Kate Winslet is easily one of the most exciting and versatile actresses alive today. She finally won a long overdue Oscar for her performance as Hanna, and she is wonderful. Aloof but naiive, Hanna is a fascinating individual and is brilliantly realized by Winslet (I have one minor quibble...when she is shown in old age, Winslet doesn't adjust her voice, but that's hardly worth mentioning). As Michael, David Kross matches her beat for beat. He's also stand-offish, but he's fallen helplessly in love with Hanna, which changes his life forever, and leads to an extraordinarily complex moral quagmire. Ralph Fiennes has a small role as the Older Michael, but we can see the similarities of a man whose picking up the pieces of a traumatic life.The film is superbly constructed by Stephen Daldry The film hits the correct note every time, however the film's ending is a little too oblique. Nevertheless, this is a rewarding and extremely involving film.",9,1,1,13 June 2010
Shooter," Nearer to a bullseye than most
","Snipers are frequently shown in movies that have high-stakes situations, but never before has there been a movie about a sniper. After all, how interesting is it to watch someone sneak around and wait for God-knows-how-long for the perfect shot? Fortunately, director Antoine Fuqua and the writers (adapted from a novel by Stephen Hunter) understand this, and that's what makes 'Shooter' a success.'Shooter' is more of a revenge film than a conspiracy thriller. Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) was one of the best snipers in the world until he was left to die on a mission that wasn't supposed to happen; his partner and best friend, Donnie (Lane Garrison) did die, which hit him really hard. Now living alone in a remote part of Wyoming, he has resigned to solitude. However, three years later, Colonel Issac Johnson (Danny Glover) tracks him down, and asks him to plan an assassination attempt on the President, so the U.S. can figure out a way to prevent a REAL assassination. But Swagger is betrayed and he has to stay alive long enough to prove his innocence.This is the kind of role Mark Wahlberg does whenever he's playing an action hero. In this situation, it works. Danny Glover is adequate as Johnson, but he doesn't have the range to play this type of character. Michael Pena is completely miscast as Nick Memphis, the FBI rookie who becomes Swagger's partner when he realizes that Swagger is innocent. Personally, I would have picked Lane Garrison to play Memphis, who, despite being in only one scene, creates a likable enough character to have resonance throughout the movie. Originally, I would have thought that Kate Mara would have been too young for this role, but I was surprised as she is entirely believable (complete with an adorable Southern accent). Rhona Mitra is utterly wasted in the throwaway role as Memphis' co-worker. My guess is that the producers gave her the role to inject some sex appeal, but her appearance doesn't support this; she's too plain looking. But the worst offense is that her acting abilities are thrown away. Mitra is a capable actress (see Season 3 of 'Nip/Tuck' for a really good performance by her).Antoine Fuqua knows what he's doing with this movie. It's dark, intelligent, and it never drags. The film deserves its R rating (an action movie for adults! Go figure.) and is all the better for it. 'Shooter' is a fast-paced thriller, but Fuqua doesn't maximize the 'Big Reveals' to outrageous proportions (in fact, one might argue that they should have been done with less subtlety).Unfortunately, 'Shooter suffers from some problems. The worst offender is its terrible lighting. The film is too dark, and while only a few scenes take place indoors, it's still too dark (too dark for a gritty feel too). Less important is the conspiracy is rather hard to figure out at times.Still, 'Shooter' is a great ride.",7,0,1,25 April 2009
The Lion King," A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making
","Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than 'The Lion King.' Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.'The Lion King' gets off to a fantastic start. The film's opening number, 'The Circle of Life,' is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.The story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.When viewing the film, it is obvious that 'The Lion King' is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.The voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He's mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He's older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it's almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He's unquestionably evil, but he's also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.Disney's animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in 'The Lion King.' Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn't noticeable). There is none of that here.Throughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. 'The Lion King' is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts ('Can You Feel the Love Tonight' won the Oscar, but in my opinion, 'The Circle of Life' was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba's girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that's what's important.'The Lion King' is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren't noticeable, and it is likely that the young won't ever notice them. 'Beauty and the Beast' was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to 'The Silence of the Lambs'), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it's hard to understand why 'The Lion King' was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.If you haven't already, see 'The Lion King.' You won't be disappointed.",10,18,24,9 August 2009
Scream," Well done, but it doesn't work like it's supposed to
","There is no doubt that this movie not only caused a resurgence in slasher movies, it completely changed the way they work. For a movie to do that, it has to be very good, and I applaud 'Scream' for its ability to do so (though I'm getting kind of tired of the style it created for a few reasons which I will list here).'Scream' is your standard slasher movie, albeit with a few major differences. First and foremost, it is a curious mix of scares and comedy, which I will get to later. Second, unlike most slasher movies, it's pretty smart. The characters do dumb things, but they talk smart, and the fact that they still do dumb things makes it pretty funny sometimes. Finally, it's well done. It all seems very fresh and nothing is sloppy or hammed up. Very welcoming.The plot is standard, but given the purpose of the movie, that's what it should be. It's a slasher movie that pokes fun at itself and the earlier entries into the genre, so it's only natural that it takes this route. Basically, a costumed psychopath is stalking and brutally murdering local teenagers (after they drink or have sex, and/or do stupid things...again, part of the joke). But it centers around one local teen, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is of course, not without a dark past.That's pretty much it. Sound familiar? It should. Again, that's the point. But what rises it above the level (significantly) is that it knows what it's doing, and isn't trying to hide it (therefore not assuming its target audience is dumber than the characters that inhabit the worst entries into the genre). The characters are actually pretty intelligent (thanks to the smart script and the solid acting across the board), and even know the rules of the slasher movies, and of course the people who laugh at the warnings die gruesome deaths by making the mistakes that they were warned about (again, it's being funny and scary at the same time).Now about that purpose I was talking about, the fact that it's aiming for both laughs and scares, sometimes at the same time. It's certainly ambitious, which is rare for a big studio, and unheard of for a horror movie, especially a slasher movie. However, I have to admit, it doesn't work like it's supposed to. The laughs dilute the scares for the most part (though there are a good few creepy moments). The beginning scene with Drew Barrymore, is excellent, though not very scary. Still, it's commendable for how well it's done. I admit that I didn't see the final twist coming, which is kind of surprising (and probably should be rather embarrassing) since it was probably meant to lampoon the feeble attempts of the same obligatory task that was made by its predecessors. Then again, movies like 'Scream' are typically not my kind of movie. But it's a modern classic of sorts (as close to it as a mainstream movie will come), so I had to check it out.While it doesn't work like it's supposed to, that doesn't mean it's a waste of time, not by a long shot. 'Scream' may not be the best horror movie, but it's undeniably engaging, and never boring. I was always involved in the movie, and its interesting tone helps a lot. It's a fun movie, in a way, but it still manages to be pretty dark and grim. The recognition for that goes to Wes Craven, rightly known as one of the masters of the genre. He puts a lot of effort into the movie, and it shows. His goal is clearly not to have the most brutal deaths and the most sex, booze and gore he can cram into a single movie (though there are significant amounts of all of them and then some). He loves what he's doing, and wants to make it the best he can, and for his part, he does the best that can be done with the material. The new mixture of laughs and scares not working is not his fault, it's the concept that doesn't work. That statement is proved by all the future horror flicks that try to use the same method, which has long worn out it's welcome (even though it never really came).The acting isn't that important, as it's not that kind of movie (slasher movies aren't supposed to be). That said, all the acting is believable, and serves the film's purpose solidly.Writer Kevin Williamson is clearly very talented, especially since this was his first script. He is an idea man (something that is almost extinct in mainstream Hollywood), and he has about as much know-how and as strong of a love for the slasher movie as Craven himself.Speaking of, Wes Craven deserves most of the credit for pulling this movie together. Again, this movie doesn't quite work like the filmmakers had perhaps hoped, but it could have been a complete mess. Applause goes to Craven for preventing that. Actually, he makes it work well enough that almost none of the horror movies these days aim for just scares, which is kind of a shame now, because after 11 years, I kind of miss those movies.Do I recommend it? Sure, just know what you're going into. If you're going into it expecting a pure scarefest like 'Halloween,' you're probably going to be disappointed because that's not what 'Scream' offers. It's a slasher movie that offers a commentary on itself. Now that's something you don't see every day.",7,0,0,27 November 2007
Halloween," The best there is
","Every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening, though they usually aren't. Most modern horror movies fit into this category.Then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual. They actually frighten you to a level that you've never experienced.'Halloween' is such a film. It takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. But nearly all of them work. 'Halloween' is awe-inspiring in its simplicity, and terrifying as a whole.The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some kids on Halloween night, while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, begins killing the local teenage population, and eventually he comes after Laurie.Sounds familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. Not a chance.I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of 'Halloween:' 'Because of its title, Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s. However, while Halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member...' He has a point, and for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it's downright terrifying, whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests (one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek, but most of those fail as well). Second, there is almost no violence (very little of which is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and he relies very little on it (actually, the body count is pretty low). In fact, one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie, at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie, each gorier and more sadistic than the last. He relies on ideas for scares, and also skill. Third, while some of the characters may do stupid things (that sometimes seal their fate), they don't do them because they're dumb. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots, we're frightened because they're making a mistake.One of the main reasons why 'Halloween' is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this film. There's no supernatural, there's no ridiculously creative plot elements, or 'inventive' murders, or whatnot. Instead, all the set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action. What we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us.Horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It's a hit or miss game, which is why if I were to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which I'm not), they'd seem primitive (particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years).Acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicted characters. The actors act like real people, not characters from a story. Nothing more. The exception to this is whoever plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill, but it's hard to pull off (and even harder to keep people from asking why). But the guy pulls it off, and the result is terrifying.This is Carpenter's movie through and through. He directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote the chilling score of it. This is a man of brilliance, and his later movie 'The Thing' supports this statement, though The Thing is not as scary as 'Halloween.' Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers 'recognize your potential.' As good as this film is, it's not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear 'The Shape.' Luckily, Carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there's no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it's disheartening when they die. But once the film gets to Halloween night, that's when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and it NEVER stops until you get to the end.While 'Halloween' may be flawed, it is only slightly so. It is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!",8,1,2,27 November 2007
Shrek," Wickedly funny!
","Few films are as wickedly clever as 'Shrek,' and even less are universally considered family films. Watching a movie this good makes us wonder why Hollywood puts out such crappy family movies that no one likes (for example, last fall's 'Old Dogs,' which while unseen by me, was attacked by critics with viciousness unseen by anything other than a Uwe Boll movie). Whatever the reason, 'Shrek' is a hysterical send-up of fairy tales (and just about everything else you could think of). And it's oddly touching.Shrek (Mike Meyers) is a grumpy ogre who lives alone, and that's the way he likes it. Unfortunately, one day a bunch of fairytale creatures move in...and they won't leave. After a series of hilarious plot conventions and send-ups involving a petite wanna-be king named Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), Shrek has to go and rescue a princess (Cameron Diaz) from a castle (in which, of course, a fire-breathing dragon has taken up residence) if he wants his swamp back.'Shrek' gave birth to the never ending series of movies where the sources of comedy where potshots at pop culture, famous movies, and what not (one could argue that 'Scary Movie,' which came out a year before, opened the door, but this film was more successful). As tired as the spoof genre became, there's a reason why it became so successful: this movie is flat-out funny! While 'Shrek' is infamous for its jabs at Disney movies, they're not the only things in the film's cross-hairs. Everything from reality TV to theme parks is skewered mercilessly, and nothing escapes the film's grasp. What's especially funny is that it's entirely suitable for all members of the family (though some of the very young may not get a few of the jokes).The voice talents are perfectly chosen. Mike Meyers is perfect as the title character, mixing grumpiness with vulnerability, and with more than a shadow of self-doubt. Even though Meyers makes the role his own after taking it over from Chris Farley after Farley's death, Meyers still keeps a little bit of Farley's trademark energy. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Donkey, who's mouth rarely stops moving. He may not be the brightest bulb in the bunch, but he sure is funny. Cameron Diaz is no stranger to comedy, and that suits her well here as the princes that is not what anyone thinks. She's a feisty 'loaded pistol' who's read a few too many fairy tales. John Lithgow may be the least famous member of the cast, but he's still hilarious as the arrogant (and tiny) Faarquad.Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson keep the tone light and fun, but with an air of mischief. They also take the time to create superlative visual effects. The animation is gorgeous and varied, realistic, but still cartoony. However, sometimes the lip movements noticeably don't match up to the words (like sometimes they start slightly before the words come out).Hilarious, but with a heart, 'Shrek' is a movie for the whole family to enjoy again and again.",8,1,3,21 May 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the most infamous thrillers ever to take home an Oscar
","There are many films out there with a reputation of being able to scare the living hell out of a viewer, but there is perhaps none as notorious as 'The Silence of the Lambs.' This is a demented and frightening motion picture, and that's the bottom line.FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to do a psychological profile of a notorious serial killer, the brilliant and insane former psychologist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Her boss, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) hopes that Lecter will be attracted to Starling's innocence, and help them catch a new serial killer, dubbed 'Buffalo Bill.' But Lecter won't do this for free, and the question becomes whether Starling is able to hold herself together against the evil doctor.This film works as well as it does because it is crafted so well. Had the direction and the acting been pedestrian, this would be just another movie. However, Director Jonathan Demme is interested in exploring his characters and inviting us into the minds of these characters. People call this a horror movie, and that's not true. This is a psychological thriller in its purest form, and the violence and fear that the film generates is due to this exploration. To do this, Demme uses a lot of close-ups so that we can study their facial features, which allows us to understand their emotions on a physical level. This is applying to our basic instincts, and it works; it allows us a deeper understanding of the characters.However, Demme's skill only goes so far; it's up to the actor's to take up the rest of the slack. And the performances by its two stars make a rather unique story into a legendary excursion into fear.Everyone knows his name. Hannibal Lecter, or more by his nickname, Hannibal the Cannibal. Lecter is the personification of evil, and there is no character more frightening than the chilling psychopath played by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins uses his eyes (he seldom blinks) and his voice to chill us to the very bone. When he walks, it's slow and methodical. Being inside a caged cell does not stop him from looking at the person outside (which from the camera position, is usually us) feel like we are being stalked by a predator. Surprisingly, in this film, Lector is only on screen for 16 minutes, yet the impact of his performance is permanent. Few performances have been more justly rewarded than Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.His counterpart, Clarice Starling, is portrayed by Jodie Foster, who it seems doesn't know how to give a bad performance. Foster is brilliant as the spunky trainee. She's in over her head, but her determination to solve the case and keep her psyche in one piece makes her a perfect match for Lecter, something they both realize. Although Hopkins gets all the credit, Foster's brilliant performance makes him even better than Hopkins could by himself. Both of their performances compliment each other well, which elevates the project from solid into brilliant. The other actors are effective, but Foster and Hopkins are the ones that really make the film what it is.This isn't a flawless movie; quite frankly, it's just not as frightening as its legend suggests, and the psychological explorations of the characters by critics and the actors make the film promise something that it doesn't have. This is simply a superbly executed thriller, one that relies on character to succeed instead of special effects.Nevertheless, this film will scare you (the climax is genuinely terrifying). And it introduces us (to the definitive interpretation at least...Brian Cox played the role in 'Manhunter' in the 80s) to one of cinema's most notorious characters. That alone is reason enough to see this film.",8,0,1,2 April 2010
Iron Man," Different kind of superhero movie, but in the vein of 'Spider-Man'
","When I say that 'Iron Man' is a different kind of superhero movie, I mean exactly that. But it's closer to the 'Spider-Man' movies than 'The Dark Knight.' It's intelligent, but not dense, or hopelessly grim. It has a sense of fun, which is seriously helped by a number of Robert Downey Jr.'s one-liners.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the Bruce Wayne of weapons design. He has more money than he can count, and is probably the world's biggest celebrity because of it. When captured in Afghanistan, he creates a prototype of a suit to become Iron Man. Thereafter, much to the shock of everyone who knows him, he decides to become a humanitarian. But that's not as easy as it sounds...The best part of 'Iron Man' is that it doesn't follow the usual superhero movie plot trajectory. It goes in different directions, with more intelligence than usual, yet director Jon Faverau keeps it feeling the same.However, the movie is let down by the casting. Robert Downey Jr. is so talented that he needed a way to break out into the mainstream again. Because 'Iron Man' accomplished this, it succeeded. Strangely though, the script lets Downey down. True, its a great performance (as only Downey can give), but once he gets back to the states (about 20 minutes into the film), he becomes a lot less interesting. Again, this isn't Downey's fault, it's the screenplay's.'Iron Man' suffers from too much star power. It has a cast of great actors, but there's not enough screen time to let them develop full personalities. Gwyneth Paltrow is a case in point. In films, big stars generally play two roles: main characters or cameos. Pepper Potts is neither. She's in-between, and because she has so much screen time, we expect more from her (I'm not a Paltrow fan, but this isn't her fault). The same problem she had in 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' applies here. She doesn't do well in action movies. Still, it is to her credit that she's doing something to help her fame OTHER than posing for Vogue magazine. Terrence Howard is solid as Rhodey, Starks' friend and military liaison. Jeff Bridges is sorely miscast as Obadiah. While he has moments of effectiveness, overall he doesn't belong here (even with the unrecognizable facial transformation).Still, 'Iron Man' must be judged based on its intentions. Does it entertain? The answer is a resounding YES!",7,2,5,18 January 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," I don't know what I think about this film
","Did I like 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona,' or not? One might think that it would make sense to hold off writing the review of the film until I make up my mind, but I'm not, since this conflicted feeling is at the heart of the film.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johannsen) are two best friends who are vacationing in Barcelona for the summer. While there, they are asked abruptly by an artist named Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) to spend the weekend with him. They eventually go, and the weekend sets in motion a series of events that cause Vicky and Cristina to really examine what they want in a relationship (Vicky is engaged, and Cristina 'only knows what she doesn't want.' 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' starts out strong and ends even stronger, but it lags in the middle. I think it would have been a lot better if about 20 minutes had been cut during this period. The characters talk, but nothing really happens during this time.The acting is strong. Rebecca Hall is very good as the practical Vicky. She knows what she wants and is satisfied with her future, at least until she meets Juan Antonio. Scarlett Johansson is slightly less impressive as Cristina, who is experimenting with the possibilities. Javier Bardem continues to impress as the artist/lover Juan Antonio. He's a seducer, and not ashamed of it. Yet he has a big heart. However, the best performance belongs to Penelope Cruz. She dominates the screen as Juan Antonio's volatile ex-wife, Maria Elena. She has some serious issues, and Cruz never lets us forget that Maria Elena can be set off by just about anything.The best thing about 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is that it looks great. The cinematography is gorgeous, and very atmospheric. However, the film has some big flaws. First off, the narration is on going, and it gets old. It helps, but it gets in the way of the story. Second, of course, is the flat middle. Nothing much happens, and boredom sets in. Fortunately, when Cruz appears, the film gets back going again. Finally, the ending doesn't fit. An ending like the one Woody Allen gave this one seems to belong in a different film.It's not 'Match Point,' but I guess it's recommendable.",6,1,2,10 July 2009
Beowulf," A different kind of epic
","Note: the version that I saw was the Director's Cut, not the theatrical cut, and it was not in 3D.Finally there's an epic that stays true to the roots. While told in a linear fashion like most epics, director Robert Zemekis has decided not to Hollywoodize the structure. Instead he leaves the story just as it is, and by doing so he gives his version of 'Beowulf' a slightly unique feel. Instead of an adaptation, 'Beowulf feels like it was directly lifted from the page.King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) has a problem. His kingdom is being terrorized by a hideous monster called Grendel (Crispin Glover). So he sends word out to any hero who will be willing to kill the monster. Beowulf (Ray Winstone) answers the call.I have not read the epic poem, but the movie doesn't feel like a movie adaptation, it feels like a movie come to life, which is interesting, since this movie is completely CGI. If you don't understand what I am talking about, watch Hollywood's previous endeavors of putting epic poems to film (say 'Lord of the Rings'). When done well, the Hollywoodization can work ('Lord of the Rings' again). But if you pay attention closely, the trilogy and 'Beowulf' FEEL different.The acting is solid. The actors know that this is not the place to showpiece their thespian skills, but all of them do what they are required. The most interesting performances are Angelina Jolie as Grendel's Mother, who is as creepy and mysterious as she is beautiful (she still looks strikingly similar to her human form), and Anthony Hopkins, who is helped by the animation to move much more freely than he probably can in real life.Now the big kahuna that is on everyone's mind: the animation. It's great. While it's brilliant in some places, it's less so in others. The detail is amazing, but some of the faces don't look realistic (especially Wealthow, the queen). In actuality, it looks very similar to the 'Shrek' movies, only a lot more detail is apparent, and it's less cartoonish.The success of this is hopeful. Maybe in the near future, animation won't be limited to family friendly movies, because as proved by Zemekis, animation provides a lot more freedom, and there are plenty of things for audiences over the age of 12 that only animation can provide.",7,0,1,23 June 2008
Speed," Great Action Flick
","The premise of a summer action movie doesn't get much better than this one: A bus in downtown LA is rigged with a bomb that is set to explode if it goes below 50 mph. But as film history will tell us, a good premise does not make a good movie unless the filmmakers do unique and interesting things with it. Does 'Speed' have what it takes? Absolutely.When it comes to action/adventure movies that expand on a single premise, there's no one better than Jan de Bont. Considering where his career is right now, that surprising, since the man who gave us masterpieces such as this and 'Twister' is being passed over for hacks and wannabees such as Simon West and other cheap posers that don't know what they're doing. de Bont never wastes a moment, and that keeps the pace up. 'Speed' is relentless, especially in this respect. The visuals are first-rate, and except for one minor exception, they surpass today's (if only because they are real, or the CGI isn't so cheap it's obvious).The acting is great as well. There are few actors as consistently wooden as Keanu Reeves (save for Luke Wilson). But I guess every actor has his day (Reeves has three: this, 'The Devil's Advocate' and 'The Matrix'). Granted, the role doesn't require much range, but Reeves creates a likable and sympathetic hero (California cool included). Dennis Hopper is a terrific villain, rivalling Alan Rickman in 'Die Hard,' though Hopper is more psychotic, or in his own words, 'eccentric.' Also noteworthy is the terrifically lovable Sandra Bullock who uses her comic aptitude to great effect, and she also allows herself to be vulnerable, which makes her more three-dimensional.Like in de Bont's later film, 'Twister,' composer Mark Macina creates a memorable theme that complements the film to perfection.Flaws aren't really a problem here (I dare anyone to name an action movie that hasn't given into temptation and gone over the top at least a little). Yes it recycles one of the twists that it used, but it still works, so I can't really fault it.Finally here's a movie that lives up to its premise and its title.",10,2,4,24 August 2008
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Inventive entry into the horror genre
","Sleep is an essential part of life; it allows our bodies and our minds to relax and recharge for the next day. It is also the time when we are the most vulnerable. When we are asleep, we are blissfully unaware of what is going on around us. Wes Craven's landmark horror film, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' takes advantage of this often overlooked part of life and uses it in unusual and effective ways.Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is your average sixteen year old girl. She's got good friends and a great boyfriend. But when her friend Tina (Amanda Wyss) is brutally murdered, and her boyfriend Rod (Jsu Garcia) is arrested for it, Nancy's world is turned upside down. However, Tina had a nightmare the night before she died, the same one that Nancy and Rod had. As her friends keep turning up dead, Nancy begins to realize that there is someone who is killing her friends in their dreams, and what happens in their dreams, happens in real life.This all sounds highly convoluted, which it is, but Craven explains it pretty thoroughly. The premise is golden, and Craven, never one to shy away from taking risks, exploits it for all it's worth. The crossing of this boundary opens up a lot of possibilities, not only for the staple events in a horror movie (gruesome and inventive murders), but some philosophical questions about this given boundary.Unfortunately while the film can boast a highly original premise and story, it's not that scary. Maybe it's because it's not particularly well-acted. Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia aren't particularly good thespians, even within the broad constraints of the genre. Heather Langenkamp is solid as the spunky heroine. For once, the heroine of the horror film isn't as dumb as a brick or supremely wimpy. She's brave, and more importantly, pretty smart. Johnny Depp shows us a glimmer of his talent as her boyfriend, Glen. Ronee Blakely is okay as Nancy's mom, who knows more about what's going on than she's telling. However, the real star of the show is not Robert Englund (who is very creepy as the film's sadistic villain, Fred Krueger), but John Saxon. Saxon is great as Nancy's sympathetic, but incredulous father. He acts just the way a normal father would act in the given situation.Wes Craven is known as the Master of Horror. While he's made a number of solid horror movies, I don't agree with that statement. His films are engaging and competently made, but they aren't all that frightening. The one thing that Craven has that no one else does is a penchant for taking risks. 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' doesn't follow the slasher film formula (in fact, this is just a horror film, and not a member of the slasher genre).It's recommendable because it's a spooky story with a few shocks and tense moments.",7,3,4,5 February 2010
Heat," The Pinnacle of the Cops and Robbers genre
","Pacino. DeNiro. Ask anyone who the greatest actors of all time are, and those two will be at the top of anyone's list. But here in 'Heat,' there is an opportunity that will cause any movie-lover to begin salivating profusely: Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro star in a movie together! The story is simple, because 'Heat' is about its characters. Robert DeNiro is Neil McCauley, a professional thief. Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna, the Los Angeles detective who is trying to prevent him from taking down his next big score.Despite being on opposite sides of the law, McCauley and Hanna are very much alike, yet their lives are governed by opposite circumstances. Hanna's marriage to Justine (the wonderful Diane Venora) is failing, while McCauley, a previously satisfied loner, finds romance with graphic designer Eady (Amy Brenneman). However, both of them have a similar mindset when it comes to their lot in life. Both of them simply do what they do best: McCauley takes scores while Hanna tries to stop him.The acting is what you'd expect it to be: outstanding. Pacino and DeNiro are in top form, and so is everyone else. Standouts from the main cast (apart from Pacino and DeNiro, of course) are the female love interests, Venora and Brenneman. Venora brings a torn sense of weariness to her character. She loves Hanna, but she also knows that he can't be the man she needs. Brenneman is great as the rather shy librarian, who decides to take a chance on Neil, but realizes that she doesn't know what she's getting into. Special mention has to go to Kevin Gage, who is seriously creepy as Waingro. Gage is absolutely chilling; he's the stuff of nightmares.When it comes to directors, Michael Mann will always have a special place in my heart. His tough-as-nails style is instantly recognizable, and 'Heat' is pure Mann (no pun intended). The film is highly stylized, often times resembling magazine ads (though not in the same way as, say, Tarsem. Think high-end apartment ads, not fashion magazines). 'Heat' is a long movie, clocking in at a little less than three hours, but Mann keeps things moving. The actors are so good that the time flies by.However, all that is fluff compared to the highlight of the movie: the robbery. Simply put, this is one of the greatest action sequences of all time. Not because it's full of explosions and extravagant stunts, but because it's so real. I had no problem believing that a bank robbery could have been carried out just like this. It's superbly choreographed and expertly shot. The sound of the gunfire is completely realistic, and the tactics are all in evident. It's exhilarating.There's not a person alive who wouldn't find something to like in this movie. It has great drama and spectacular action. 'Heat' definitely is one of the masterworks of the cops and robbers genre.",10,4,8,19 April 2009
300," Visceral and Awesome
","The best thing about '300' is not the jaw-dropping visuals, not the muscle-toned heroes or the gorgeous women, nor is it the story. The best part about '300' is its visceral enjoyment factor. You gotta love a movie where the characters don't just kick ass and take names, they thoroughly enjoy doing it.The film is about the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) who takes 300 of his best soldiers to hold off the Persian advance. Meanwhile, back at home, his beautiful wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Heady) is getting ready to appeal to the Council of Elders for sending more soldiers to assist Leonidas. But to that end, she has to get them to listen to her instead of Theron (Dominic West), the slimy Elder who wants the position of king for himself.The first thing one notices about '300' is its visuals. They're spectacular. It's like a painting come to life. The people look like a mix between real and computer generated, but the effect works. The film is highly enjoyable on regular DVD, but it's even better in HD. In his late-written review of the film, Roger Ebert criticized the film for having all the Spartan soldiers be perfectly toned musclemen. He's missing the point. This is a highly stylized film, and having them look like that adds to the visceral enjoyment of the film.The acting is solid, although unspectacular. Gerard Butler got his big break here as Leonidas. Butler is great as the warrior-king, and knows exactly how to play the character. The film is over-the-top in a very stylized sort of way, and Butler fits right in. It helps that he can scream some of the famous lines in the film, ones that are already going down in history. As his wife, Lena Heady is equal to him. She may be a female, but she's no meek housewife (as one Persian finds out the hard way). One immediately gets the sense that if she could, she'd be fighting right beside her husband. Dominic West is perfectly slimy as the traitorous Theron. Imagine the villainous alter-ego of Mark Wahlberg, and this is who you get. David Wenham is also good as the Dilios, who is also the narrator. He has an interesting voice, and it is used to great effect. Rodrigo Santoro is perfect as the androgynous, but no less menacing Xerxes.Zack Snyder has a clear knack for visuals. Even if the story was dull, which it's not, it would still be worth watching just to see the visuals. His trademark technique of slowing an image down then immediately speeding it up is used very effectively here, and while he keeps the film over-the-top, he never goes overboard.This is a very violent film, almost cheerfully so. A story like this needs to have blood, guts, and brutal finishing movies to have its effect. Thank God the studios realized this and allowed it to have an R rating. The film would have been ruined had it been neutered to anything less. It's a shame to think about how many films have been rendered inert from diluting the violence.Historical accuracy was not a concern to Frank Miller (the author of the comic book which the film is based on) nor the filmmakers except where it suits the story. The film portrays Spartan culture very well, probably because it suits the story. The training of boys into men is very true, and the Spartans were ruled by a council of Elders (although since the council was made up of men who became too old to fight, West is too young to play the character, but never mind). Also, Spartan women were given a lot of freedom, and the portrayal of Queen Gorgo is reasonably accurate. More importantly, the film's version of how Spartans viewed military endeavors was also very true. The quotes 'they were taught that to die in battle was the greatest glory a Spartan man could ever achieve' and 'Come back with your shield, or on it' are very true of Sparta. The Persians don't fare as well, though. The actual number of Persians who fought at the Battle of Thermopylae is debated, and there certainly weren't any of the bizarre creatures that Frank Miller dreamed up. Not that this is a bad thing...'300' has everything an action movie should have. You want action? You got it. You want visceral enjoyment? It's here. Blood, guts, naked women and hot sex? Yup.In short, '300' is a thoroughly enjoyable and unapologetically violent film that every guy will love.",8,2,3,17 December 2009
Aladdin," Timeless
","It's been nearly fifteen years since the theatrical release of 'Aladdin,' and every time I watch it I am transported back in time to when I first saw it in theaters as a child.'Aladdin' is a magical film; wondrous, exhilarating, and beautiful. While it may not be the BEST Disney film (that goes to its predecessor, 'Beauty and the Beast'), it's the most fun.The story is loosely based on the 'Aladdin and the King of Thieves' tale (or so I'm told). I'm not that familiar with the source material, but the movie begins with Aladdin, a street beggar who finds a magic lamp and becomes a prince. Complications ensue when the sultan's adviser, Jafar, tries to get it too, and Aladdin has to deal with mounting pressure and guilt from the fact that his princehood isn't real (which is a problem since the princess can only marry a prince).Anyone who talks about this film is bound to bring up Robin Williams sooner or later, and rightly so. Williams dominates this movie, and it shows. The genie is the most entertaining character to watch, as it's paired with William's boundless energy and nonstop imitations (that change in a flash). Williams elevates 'Aladdin' from great to absolutely brilliant, and nonstop entertaining.Fortunately, the rest of the movie matches up to William's performance just about evenly. The rest of the voice-overs are great. Scott Weinger is perfect as Aladdin, making it easy to sympathize with Aladdin. Brad Kane's singing voice is almost indistinguishable from Weinger's, which is in and of itself impressive. Linda Larkin/Lea Salonga are great as Jasmine, as is the rest of the cast, which includes Gilbert Gottfried as the sarcastic, wisecracking parrot Iago (who, interestingly enough, is elevated to more than just the villain's sidekick).While I'm on the subject of the voices, I have to bring to light another member of the voice cast. That is Jonathan Freeman. He is tremendously talented, and creates the most vile villain ever to grace a Disney film; so much so that the likes of Ursula, Gaston, Hades and, ugh, Radcliffe, all pale to the likes of Jafar. With his thin figure, large, twisted smile, and vicious eyes, he's absolutely chilling. In a good way, of course.Like the rest of the Disney musicals (the weak 'Pocahantas' aside), the music is vibrant and infectious, accompanied by stunning visuals. The script is more intelligent than the majority of the more 'adult' films, and it is wildly entertaining. Definitely check it out.",10,1,1,20 February 2008
Gangs of New York," Not Scorcese's best, but still good
","Martin Scorcese is rightly considered one of cinema's all-time greatest directors, having made some true classics such as 'Taxi Driver' and some great films like 'The Aviator.' 'Gangs of New York' is a good film, but not his best.William Cutting, aka Bill the Butcher (the brilliant Daniel Day-Lewis), rules over The Five Points, with everyone, including the corrupt politician Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) working for him in some way or another. But his control is wavering as Irish immigrants are flooding into the country. Bill hates this, and a rivalry forms over the control of The Five Points between Bill's Nativists, and the immigrants' Dead Rabbits, lead by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). During a bloody battle, Bill kills Priest, and Priest's son, Amsterdam, is sent to an orphanage. Years later, Amsterdam (now played by Leonardo DiCaprio) rises through the ranks of Bill's gang in order to get revenge.On the surface, this is a simple revenge story. But Scorcese takes us to another time and place, and creates a world that is both violent and whimsical. In a way, it's like Dickens as told by Scorcese.The acting is solid across the board. Daniel Day-Lewis is outstanding as Bill the Butcher, being both sadistic and human at the same time. He outshines everyone else, but that doesn't mean that everyone else is bad. Leonardo DiCaprio is solid as Amsterdam Vallon, but he's been better. Perhaps the most surprising performance comes from Cameron Diaz. Known mainly for comedy, Diaz throws herself into the role, and while not the BEST performance, she's still great, and more than holds her own against the other thespians. It proves that she has more range than previously thought, and should get more dramatic roles. There are also a lot of familiar faces sprinkled in amongst the ensemble, and all give great performances. Liam Neeson's appearance at the beginning is brief, but it's always refreshing to see him. John C. Reilly, Jim Broadbent, and Brendan Gleeson are also here. Henry Thomas, little Elliot from 'ET' is here, all grown up, and it's clear that he hasn't outgrown his acting ability.The problem is that 'Gangs of New York' is overlong, and there are long stretches where it gets kind of boring. The scene where people are trying to rig the votes for sheriff is a case in point. It's too long and feels unnecessary. The action sequences are well-done, but sometimes the cuts are too quick and have some awkward moments. The ending is especially disappointing. It's confusing and pretty messy.'Gangs of New York' is a solid film, but it's just not as good as it could have been",8,0,0,8 April 2008
Braveheart," One of the great epics of our time
","The best thing about the good epics is that you feel right there with the hero. At every step you want your hero to succeed and the villain to fail. The rousing feeling you get flowing through you is rushing through you at full speed, and everything else around you ceases to exist. 'Braveheart' is like that. Mel Gibson's medieval epic is bursting with power an intensity, and it is filmed on a grand scale that is both a joy to the eye and the spirit. The characters are larger than life, the action sequences are bloody and exciting, and William Wallace is a man that anyone can sympathize with.William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is a Scotsman (kilt included), and nothing will change that. But times are hard for the Scots. The English hold an oppressive rule over Scotland, and it's ruled by the tyrannical Longshanks (aka King Edward I, played by Patrick McGoohan). Eventually William Wallace decides he's had enough, so he arouses his fellow Scots in a fight for freedom.That's the gist of it, though in a very general sense. Yes, I left a lot out, but see the movie! The acting is terrific. Mel Gibson knows what he is doing with William Wallace. Wallace is broadly drawn in the fashion of epics, but Gibson plays him with such intensity that he's always interesting and it's impossible NOT to root for the guy. Patrick McGoohan may not be the BEST villain, but he's villainous enough to really hate. Sophie Marceau does a lot with a small role. Despite not having much screen time, Marceau is skilled enough to develop her character a lot. She's quiet and obedient on the surface, but inside she's independent and intelligent. It's a star-making performance, and it's a pity she isn't as popular as she deserves. Angus Macfayden is arguably the weakest of the main characters, but he's adequate. He ably portrays a conflicted man whose sympathies are torn. Also good are Brendan Gleeson as Wallace's right-hand man, Hamish, and Catherine McCormack as Wallace's lover, Murron. Comic relief is supplied, but thankfully not overused, by David O'Hara as the nutty Irishman, who (literally) talks to God. And it's hilarious to see James Cosmo as Hamish's father, who despite being an old geezer, is a nearly psychotic warrior.As a director, Mel Gibson clearly knows how to craft an epic. 'Braveheart' is his best film by far. It's grand, it's exciting, and it's rousing entertainment. Despite being almost three hours long, it never drags. Though his later films demonstrate this as fact, 'Braveheart' shows that Gibson is not afraid of showing graphic violence and gore (both of which are plentiful in 'Braveheart'). To be fair, Gibson shows the ugliness of violence, but wisely only uses it to enhance the film, not to make the viewer feel guilty or depressed. Part of the reason why this film works so well is that it uses real people as extras (or at least it seems to). Lately, big-budget movies use a lot of CGI to create big crowds, but it's been done so many times that it has long since become boring and overblown. It's refreshing to see huge masses of people that are REALLY PEOPLE.'Braveheart' is a very good film, but it's not perfect. The development is a little rushed at times in the first half, and sometimes things can get a trite confusing. But this is nitpicking. 'Braveheart' is a brilliant film, and a must-see for anyone.",10,4,8,20 June 2008
Moon," A tense and disturbing thriller
","Thrillers work best when they are allowed to slowly go from a simmer to a boil. It's a pity that Hollywood doesn't realize this, and panders to the ADD-afflicted masses, which is why we get a ton of garbage like 'Transformers' and less movies like 'Moon.' Duncan Jones' debut film is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. But it does generate a good amount of tension and a pervasive sense of unease.In the near future, most of the world's power is being harvested from rock on the moon. The base is occupied by one person at a time for a three year contract. This time around, it's by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), and he's only got three weeks left. But the isolation is really beginning to take its toll on him, and he senses that his mental state is quickly beginning to unravel.I don't want to give anything away, but the film can be confusing. 'Moon' is a sci-fi/mystery, so naturally the tension revolves around the answers to unknown questions. But good thrillers of this ilk leave viewers hungry for answers. I was left confused and somewhat irritated by the film for much of the running time. Much of that has to do with Jones' handling of the material.However, the film looks great. For a film with a mere 5 million dollar budget, 'Moon' looks like it was made with a budget 50 times that. I felt like I had been on the moon for three years, and that kind of claustrophobic tension is the film's greatest success.This is a one-character show (well, two, if you count GERTY, a robot who is voiced by Kevin Spacey). A bad performance could tank the project, but fortunately the film's central character is being played by up-and-coming character actor Sam Rockwell, who continues to impress with one terrific performance after another. Rockwell is terrific as a man on the edge, and his desperation is actually rather heartbreaking. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as the helpful GERTY. I haven't heard a voice this soothing since Goran Visnjic in 'Close Your Eyes.' There are many laudable qualities to this film, but the amount of time I spent confused was too much for me to give more than a weak recommendation. Still, this is a film where the trailer gives almost nothing about the plot (for once). Not that that has anything to do with the quality of the film...My rating: PG-13 for language.",6,2,11,3 May 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Exhilarating!
","Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is at the same time a blur and a rush of color, emotion, and action. It moves so fast that one would think that it would be in danger of getting the audience lost, but no. Boyle may go a little over the top in directorial style, but the audience is with the movie every step of the way.Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is on India's 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' Question by question, he gets them all correct and is racking up a huge amount of cash. So much so, that the host (Anil Kapoor) thinks he's cheating. But under interrogation, he reveals how he knows the answers through flashbacks of his life.While the story could (and for the most part, does) succeed on its own, Danny Boyle turns it into a director's show. Mostly, it works. He draws us into the story and keeps things moving. Unfortunately though, sometimes the quick cuts become a bit much, and the frantic pace allows for only limited character development and identification.Fortunately though, his actors are so good that it doesn't matter...almost. The trio of actors that portray Jamal (at various stages in his life) create a protagonist that is impossible not to root for. Likewise, the actors and actresses that play the other two central characters (Latika and Saleem) are very effective as well. The very root of the story is the romance between Jamal and Latika, and the performers deliver (particularly Patel and Frieda Pinto).'Slumdog Millionaire' is a terrific movie, and though Boyle draws us in and keeps us there, ultimately its the actors who make it special.",8,1,3,18 March 2009
Donnie Darko," Gutsy and brilliant
","It takes a lot of guts to purposefully make a movie that makes no sense, especially if it's meant to be serious. But strangely, 'Donnie Darko' works because it hints at so many things, which are explained with just enough information, that it's always captivating.Donnie Darko (a terrific Jake Gyllenhall) is an already troubled kid when the movie starts. But when a mysterious bunny rabbit draws him away from his house, thus saving him from a fatal accident, the real story starts.Apart from what Iv'e said before, there are two things that are really surprising about this movie: how professional it looks, and the star power it has. According to the IMDb trivia, 'Donnie Darko' had a 5 million dollar budget. But this film looks as professional as any other film that's released with a budget fifty times that. That's especially interesting considering the star power it has. Either Richard Kelly was very good at selling his script, or all the actors immediately got everything just by reading it (which I would have thought impossible because a lot of the stuff that happens is very visual). I guess it also helps that Drew Barrymore is an executive producer. Whatever it is, it worked, and the movie is all the better for it.This is a love it or hate it movie. If you don't like to think when you watch movies, you'd probably be better off staying away from this one. You're not 'invited' to think during this movie, thinking is pretty much a necessity. It's that complex. But for those who are willing to give this a try, the experience is well worth your time and money.",10,2,6,20 July 2008
Jurassic Park," A Classic
","In general, summer action movies are lumped together as dumb fun with over-the-top action sequences, simple stories that require limited to no brainpower and stock characters. However financially successful they may be, few of these are given any serious thought by cineastes. 'Jurassic Park,' although one of the highest grossing films of all time (it was at the top until 'Titanic'), has been lumped together with 'dumb fun' movies like 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or 'Superman.' That's unfair, because it's not giving Steven Spielberg's film it's due credit. This film is a classic of cinema in the same way that 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Casablanca' are.On a small island off the coast of Costa Rica, an entrepreneur named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has done the impossible: he has brought dinosaurs back to life. In order to put his investors at ease, he has brought three scientists to take the tour and give their stamp of approval. But things go wrong, and what was going to be a fun weekend is now a desperate fight for survival.The late great Michael Crichton had a tremendous gift for fudging science to make something impossible seem believable. Of course this story couldn't happen, but the story is told in a way that makes it seem credible. This adds a certain level of verisimilitude to the film that it desperately needs.Many have criticized the film for its characterization, or lack thereof. This is not only unfair, but it's also untrue. Many characters in classic films were not richly developed. The characters here are no better developed than Rick and Ilsa from 'Casablanca.' What makes those two characters to memorable is that they were portrayed by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Additionally, the characters here are indeed multi-faceted. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) begins the film as a man who hates kids, but once he gets to know Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello), he warms up to them. More importantly, any further attempts to develop the characters would have merely wasted time in an already perfect film.The actors in the film were not big names at the time of production (obvously for budgetary reasons). That all changed after this movie. Most of the actors have had successful careers, especially Samuel L. Jackson and arguably Wayne Knight. All give solid performances. Sam Neill is good as the aloof scientist, but circumstances cause him to warm up to others. Laura Dern is also good as his paleobotanist girlfriend, who actively tries to bring out his human characteristics. Jeff Goldblum is delightful as the cynical and sarcastic 'chaotician,' and he supplies most of the film's humor. Richard Attenborough is actually the film's most tragic figure. He had the best intentions, but he deluded himself into believing that he could control this startling new technology. Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight are on hand in small but important roles.Without a doubt the dinosaurs are the main attraction of the movie. And believe me, they go above and beyond the call of duty. Creative and technical experts at Industrial Light and Magic pushed the limits of visual effects in film-making to a point that has been unrivaled ever since. These days, CGI is done cheaply, and it's obvious what is and what isn't computer-generated. Not here. Even today, after visual-effects extravaganzas like 'Titanic' and 'Lord of the Rings,' nothing has even come close to the dinosaurs of 'Jurassic Park.'But for all the special effects and solid performances, one must not forget Steven Spielberg's stellar work on this film. 1993 was a huge year for Spielberg. In the summer, he came out with this mega-blockbuster classic. Later that fall, he released what is arguably his most celebrated work, the Holocaust-epic 'Schindler's List.' Altogether, they're two very different films than cannot and should not be compared, but if anything, they demonstrate Spielberg's skill and versatility. Spielberg is most at home with big budget epics (although he has taken forays into smaller scale films as well). But when viewing this film, one is forced to realize that Spielberg's skill when it comes to creating suspense. There are a number of sequences that are genuinely frightening. The first encounter with the T-Rex, the climax, just to name a few. But for me, the scariest part of the movie was Dennis' encounter with the Dilophosorus that sticks out in my mind when it comes to scary movie moments in 'Jurassic Park.' All in all, saying any more about 'Jurassic Park' would either give something away, or become repetitive. The bottom line is that this movie is a terrifying classic that will get anyone's blood pumping. It is also one of the best films ever made.",10,1,2,6 March 2010
Up in the Air," Terrific Adult film
","'Up in the Air' is a rarity; a film specifically aimed at adults. The content and maturity level are aimed at people in the business world. There are no unique special effects or sound ques to alert those who wouldn't otherwise get the joke or understand the dialogue to get the picture. While that may eliminate the most lucrative audience (teenage boys), for those in the film's target range, it makes it more special and fulfilling.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a man whose job is to go all around the country and 'assist companies in transitioning their clients.' In his words, he's the guy bosses hire to fire their employees. Ryan spends about 90% of the year either in a plane or in a hotel room, and that's just the way he likes it; this eliminates his need for companionship. But when a new employee, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) develops a new way to fire employees over the internet, he shows her the ropes in order to avoid having to go home to an empty apartment. However, she opens his eyes to why human companionship may actually be really worth it, and he begins a romance with a fellow full-time traveler, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga).This is a standard order romantic comedy/drama. Plotwise, there are no real surprises, so in order to fill up the void, the film must rely on smart dialogue and terrific performances. 'Up in the Air' has both. The characters are richly developed, and some scenes are laugh-aloud funny.This is easily George Clooney's best performance; another Oscar nomination is a given fact, and a second win certainly isn't out of the question. Clooney has a reputation for playing guys who do their own thing, regardless of whether it makes sense (or is legal). Ryan Bingham is no different, but Clooney works hard to add a few more dimensions to his character, and it works. Anna Kendrick is wholly believable as the Ivy League yuppie who opens his eyes to why staying single and alone maybe isn't the best thing. She also opens some of the film's funniest sequences. Vera Farmiga is also great as the woman whom Ryan begins a romance with. Clooney and Farmiga have terrific chemistry together, and co-writer/director Jason Reitman develops their relationship slowly and carefully. With romances where circumstances require the lovebirds to be away from each other for most of the picture, we only really want them to end up together in the end because the movie tells us to. This is not the case here. Once Ryan figures out that he really does want someone to spend the rest of his life with, the film focuses on the relationship between Ryan and Alex. This romance, which has already begun to burn is now allowed to catch fire and burn up the screen.The only real problem with the film is the ending. The film throws a one-two punch at the viewer, and while it's not typical, it's been done before. Sometimes this kind of ending can work, but I'm not sure it does here.Still, 'Up in the Air' is a wonderful film and highly recommended for corporate world adults.",7,4,9,20 December 2009
Atonement," A marvelous, sweeping love story
","'Atonement' is one of those movies that completely draws you in and never really lets you go, even after the credits start rolling. It is to the film's credit that it manages to be completely unforgettable, even after a year of having viewed it.The film is divided into two parts: the first half is a mystery that is slowly unveiled, and told from two different viewpoints. The second half is more straightforward, but it has a number of flashbacks. This is a densely plotted film, and, especially during the first hour, it requires absolute attention from the viewer (don't worry. The film is so good that this will happen anyway). As such, I can't give much in way of the plot (just watch the trailer).The acting is outstanding. Keira Knightly has never been one to 'sell out' to Hollywood; she clearly only takes on projects that interest her and challenge her. Her performance as Cecilia Tallis is easily her best performance, and should have earned her a second Oscar nomination. She captures every emotion perfectly, and uses restraint to emphasize the effect of her emotions. Likewise, James McAvoy equals her, giving us a perfect romantic foil for Cecilia. McAvoy wisely avoids giving us a Harlequin romance lead; instead he creates a real person that has a powerful romantic connection with his co-star.Saoirse Roman, despite being very young, holds her own against the up-and-coming A-listers. She's a natural, and perfectly captures the complexity of her character. Much of what she does and feels is presented without words, and only a truly talented actress like Roman can pull it off. Her Oscar nomination was well deserved. Her older counterpart, played by Romala Garai, is so good that it is hard to believe that these are two different actresses, and not one character that simply grew up. It's tough to pull off, but Roman and Garai are perfectly in synch.'Atonement' could have gone wrong in so many ways, but director Joe Wright manages to keep it all straight. He keeps things moving, including a 5-minute long, unbroken take across a soldier-filled beach. Additionally, the soft light he chose for the film enhances the experience, producing an almost dream-like quality to the film, and even in the war scenes, it works.The best part of 'Atonement' is that it's kept on a personal level. While all the characters are caught up in an extraordinary event, the story that connects them is purely personal. There is no 'national scandal,' or flashing photographers wanting a scoop on this drama. There are only a few characters who knew about what happened, and novelist Ian McEwan and especially Wright wisely focus on them. Wright keeps the epic scale of the war intact, but he personalizes the drama.'Atonement' is a beautiful and harrowing film. It is not to be missed, and was easily one of the best, if not THE best, films of 2007.",10,2,4,12 March 2009
V for Vendetta," Interesting and provocative
","There is no doubt that 'V for Vendetta' will arouse many questions after viewing, and that's okay, it's a film that deserves to be discussed. It tackles some difficult subjects head on, including, totalitarian regimes, censorship, revolution, terrorism, many of which are especially touchy in today's climate.Britain has suffered a lot of chaotic tragedies of late, and the government is now headed by Adam Sutler (the wonderfully psychotic John Hurt). This is a totalitarian regime at its most nightmarish (think '1984'). Now a man who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and a wig (Hugo Weaving) is bringing chaos and terror to Sutler's regime and stirring the seeds of revolution. Helping him, unbeknownst to her at first, is a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman).The acting is terrific. Natalie Portman is solid as Evey, showing vulnerability and determination. Her weakest scenes are the ones where she has to yell and scream a lot, but those are few. Also, she holds a consistent British accent all the way through. Stephen Rea underplays his role, perhaps a little too much. John Hurt has a lot of fun foaming at the mouth all the time, and his presence, mostly from a video screen, commands our attention.Portman may get top billing for the movie (which is not just because she's the biggest name-she really is the protagonist), but the best performance comes from Hugo Weaving. At times V is a menacing, deadly foe, but at other times, particularly around Evey, he is a sympathetic, human creature. It's a brilliant performance, and Weaving could have used an Oscar nod for it (though he did not get it).James McTeigue was the protégé of The Wachowski Brothers, who created 'The Matrix' movies. McTeigue knows what he is doing, and creates his own visual style that emphasizes light and shadow, among other things. It may not be 'Sin City,' but McTeigue's vision suits the material well.It's nice to find a movie that is not afraid to ask questions, especially difficult ones. It's great to find one that doesn't dumb it all down. 'V for Vendetta' will get people talking. Many will disagree with what it has to say. Either way, it's still a great film to see in it's own right.",7,1,6,15 June 2008
