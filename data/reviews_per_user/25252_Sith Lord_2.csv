Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not As Bad As You Have Heard
","It has its flaws. The most irritating one is the scientific approach to the Force.  Jar Jar himself is just a comic relief, but I will admit, a few less appearances would have done, too. The Story fits itself nicely into the grand scheme, nothing to complain here.Now, the light side: A terrific vizualisation, great FX (but you really did not expect anything less, did you?), fantastic score by John Williams, a great racing scene and furious swordfights. And, of course, Darth Maul, one of the most impressing characters not only in the series, but in movie history.Some people said this one was stupid- well, Episode IV was not that much more intelligent. But in about 5 years, when the saga is complete, each chapter will shine as an important part of it.May the Force be with you!",10,0,1,1 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This one changed filmmaking forever
","So much has been said and written about 'Star Wars' that there is not much left. Lets just say that the saga (Episodes I-VI) is on its way to become the greatest Work-of-Art in movie history. By the way, it is my opinion that commenting on single episodes is fruitless. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.",10,0,0,30 January 2000
