The Blair Witch Project," One of the greatest movies of all time.
","The Blair Witch Project should weave through everyone's senses, except for maybe those that have been desensitized by one of Hollywood's 'teen/slasher' or 'FX'd to death' films. Most teenagers will not appreciate this film, simply because they have seen too many 'Scream' flicks, which in my opinion are mockeries of true horror. The Blair Witch Project is way over most people's heads. If you say you don't like it, then you don't admire fine art. There is no way to discredit this film, simply because it was not made to look like a movie. There's not really suppose to be a pay off scene, and there's not supposed to be a formula. If there was real footage, I doubt very seriously it would look any different than this. The Blair Witch Project is a true masterpiece. If you have any imagination at all, you shouldn't have any problems getting scared out of your mind. Happy Camping!",10,1,3,5 August 1999
Requiem for a Dream," Believe the hype! This is the most disturbing movie ever made.
","I've seen Men Behind the Sun, I Stand Alone, The Untold Story, Guinea Pig: Flowers of Flesh & Blood, Seven, and practically every other disturbing movie ever made, and this makes all of those films seem like comedies. I'm not joking. This must be seen to be believed. For those of you that think this is some long, anti-drug, MTV video, you've got another thing coming. This film will tear you a new =o=.",10,0,0,16 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Is it flawed? Hell, who cares!
","I don't care if this film completely follows the book or not. I wouldn't know, because I've never read it. All I know is that this *film* is a masterpiece. Did I like Phantom Menace? No. Am I a Tolkien freak? No. But who cares, right? Do yourself a favor, go see this epic masterpiece.",10,0,0,3 January 2002
