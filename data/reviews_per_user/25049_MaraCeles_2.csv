Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Take a deep breath...
","Ok, ok, people...just calm down.So most believe that 'The Phantom Menace' wasn't that great of a movie. Even though the graphics were good, the actions scenes awesome, the fight scenes BEAUTIFUL, and the politics well thought.  For the most part, the film was excellent.  We only have one problem with it:We don't feel for the characters.Well, DUH!!!!Tell me this, when you first saw 'A New Hope,' and didn't see any of it's sequels...did you care when Obi-Wan died?  Or were you just like 'that's sorta sad, poor Luke, but the idiot-old-man shouldn't have fought Vader in the first place.'Funny.  I'm sure that's what the rest of us are thinking about Qui-Gon.And Luke himself.  He was some moron of a kid wishing for things he knew NOTHING of.  He was whiny and spoiled, and you sorta wished he would bite it, or at least grow up a bit.  Did you CARE about him AT ALL?Hmm.We complain:  Obi-Wan says next to nothing in the film.  Well, OF COURSE HE DOESN'T!!!!  He's the damned apprentice, and a well disciplined one at that. He basically talks just as much as Luke did, and follows people around just as much; but at least when he talks, he's not whining.  Forgive me, but I think that comparing him to Luke in 'A New Hope'...Obi is MUCH more of a sympathetic character.I think it's unfair to look at 'The Phantom Menace' all by itself.  When we think of the original trilogy, we think just that...the trilogy.  We love the old characters because we know EVERYTHING about them by the time the story ends...but imagine ONLY seeing 'A New Hope.'  We'd think the storyline dismal, of course.I think we should wait until the rest of the prequel comes out before making any judgements.Mara Celes",Null,1,2,17 August 2001
Velvet Goldmine," Absolutely Beautiful in All Possible Ways
","To be completely honest, I only rented this movie because Ewan MacGregor was in it.  I loved him in Star Wars, and I became so very curious about the rest of his films, so I checked this one out.  I admit to feeling a bit of skepticism when I saw it was another 'boring rock-and-roll movie,' and I was fully prepared to be bored outa my mind.  And hey, it was only $2.50 to be wasted, so what the hey...This movie is worth SO MUCH MORE!!!!!Velvet Goldmine is absolutely stunning.  Its visuals are beautiful, it's story unique and thought-consuming, it's actors brave and believable.  From the very first scene, you are sucked into this marvelous film.  Its a lovely tale.  Now, usually, I'm one of the people complaining about 'pretentious arty crap', but this film eludes that title gracefully; it is truly worth seeing.  I understand that this is fiction, and not truly the stories of Iggy Pop and David Bowie, but as a chic born way after the Glam Rock Era faded away, I am everlastingly grateful to this film for bringing that era back to the forefront.  Velvet Goldmine makes me nostalgic for an Era that passed long before I was born...The film was visually beautiful.  The glittered and all-pampered-up scenes meld nicely with the raw choatic sensuality prevalent in the film.  The montage format makes things interesting as well.  The flashiness catches your attention and holds it.The cast was brilliantly selected.  Rhys Meyers excelled at bringing the controversial Brian Slade to life; I both loved and hated Slade, as well as pitied and gloated over him.  You can't help but despise the man just a little bit at his selfish antics; his unthinking pursuit of his own goals at everyone else's expense makes you want to pummel him.  And yet, when you see him with Curt Wild (Ewan MacGregor), you start to love him all the same. Brian Slade aka Maxwell Demon aka THE BIGGEST POSER YOU'LL EVER SEE is pretentious, cold, and arrogant, and yet the glimpses of vulnerablity and love you barely see within make him suddenly human.
Christian Bale's character, Arthur, was also invaluable to the storyline. It's so moving to see his story, from uncertain and innocent boy to the jaded man he becomes.  His last scene, where he says, 'It's a freedom you can allow yourself...or not,' really got to me, and you can't help but hope that his character will be even braver in the future.  His character speaks to all the timid and learning ones out there.However...MacGregor stole the show, and I'm not just being partial.  Curt Wild was an AMAZING character; his total and unapologetic honesty with himself, his close friends, his love Brian Slade, and his audience leave him something to be respected and admired.  He accomplishes sincerity without being jaded, cruel, or defeated; even in the end, where most would be downtrodden, there is still a unquenchable glint of vitality in him.  He is wild, unpredictable, and more-often-than-not crude (WHOOO HOOO!!!  NAKED EWAN!!!  HEHEH!), but he shines like the shooting stars in the film.
The love story between Curt and Brian is sweet and touching, and it leaves you hoping that they beat the odds at the end, and are still together. Take a look at the small details---like where Curt is working when Arthur calls him up at the end---and see if you can't tell me that their romantic life, at least, came together.That's the beauty of this film...alot of it can be left up to personal interpretation.  This means the plot can be confusing if you aren't paying strict attention; if you leave the room or ignore a section, especially near the end of the film, you'll believe that it didn't make sense.  There are so many details in this film that seem irrelevant at first glance, but the more times you watch this film...the better it gets.  In reality, this film will totally blow you away, if you allow it.A must see; Velvet Goldmine is my favorite film EVER.",10,5,7,5 August 2001
