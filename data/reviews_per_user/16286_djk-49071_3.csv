Black Swan," I wasted my time trusting IMDB rating and all the hype
","I just don't know what to say about this film, I was waiting for the movie to live up to it's rating and my expectations but anyway. I just want to know 1 thing, why so much high rating and hype of this movie ?",1,4,5,22 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Painful to watch my Superhero turned into a big JOKE
","I tried my best to like and watch this movies as reviews on IMDB seems to be good but turned out they must have been by those Kids watching this movie and coming back to IMDB to write the reviews because they have been so excited to at last have found their type of superhero but sorry, real Spiderman is not supposed to be that. This Spiderman seems like 10 years old bad humour slave to the Ironman nothing without gadgets or is there something else in the movie ? I haven't watched the whole movie as it was really painful, literally very painful to watch first 10-15 minutes of the movie. I know time has changed but do kids these days really have that bad sense of humour ? and Aunt May ? I mean really ? I've had enough. Really sad.
p.s. I especially 'logged in' here the first time ever just to write this review as rating for this movie on IMDB seems to be not correct and looks like someone paying someone to write 10/10 review here or may these kids have never watched or read the comics.",1,5,8,18 July 2018
