Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Next time I want to vomit I'll just eat roaches.
","Originally I wondered how Sacha Baron Cohen could be more annoying on Letterman than Robin Williams, and the clip they showed looked ignorant, but the reviews raved about Borat and I thought that maybe it might be good socio-political satire. I should have followed my instincts. The satire was almost nonexistent and it was more ignorant than I could have imagined. There was no flow. It was as if someone pieced together scraps of a junky's family video. It showed flagrant disregard for the kindness and patience of his victims. Nobody deserves to be treated like that, but it is passed off as humor. And furthermore, If I wanted to see an ugly, morbidly obese pervert and a grotesque skinny guy wrestling around naked with their genitals in each other's faces I would have to be as twisted as they are.Many years ago I made the mistake of going to a stinker called 'The Black Hole'. It was so tedious that nearly everyone fell asleep. I never thought that another movie could be worse, but I now know that I was severely mistaken. The Black Hole was a delight compared to Borat.",1,26,52,22 December 2006
