3:10 to Yuma," Best Western since Tombstone
","This remake of the classic 50's western was truly one of the most entertaining movie-going experiences I've had this year. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe again do not disappoint. Both actors add a level of depth to characters that could've just as easily been archetypes for good and evil. And the movie itself could've easily been edited down to receive a PG or PG-13 rating, but I'm glad the filmmakers decided against that in order to show the grittiness of the Old West. The supporting actors also did a fantastic job, especially Ben Foster. Foster has been surprising me lately with how he disappears into a role. I didn't recognize him as The Stranger in '30 Days of Night', just the same as his role as Charlie Prince in this film. Some may argue that this doesn't live up to the original, but the strong performances all around and the grittiness lacking in the original should set this apart.",8,3,7,15 January 2008
Die Hard 2," Underrated Sequel
","I re-watched this movie the other night after many years, and I must say I don't know why people complain about it so much, it totally kicked as much ass as I remembered!! All the elements are there for a good Die Hard: emotional connection, bad guys you truly want to see dead, sarcastic John McLane kicking ass in new and inventive ways with little help, and of course let's not forget Al Powell. The basic story is this: it's Christmas in a Washington DC airport and John McLane is waiting for his wife Holly to arrive. He suspects something is amiss when he sees two men who are up to no good and of course he is right, the action continues to build from there. I don't want to spoil the rest for anyone but I will say this: Expoding airplanes, Det. Sipowicz, and terrorists, OH MY!! Sure, some people will say there are too many plot holes, but this is the epitome of a great action movie, I say plot holes be DAMNED!!!",7,0,3,24 May 2007
