The Ring," Just amazing!
","To say that The Ring is a fantastic movie is an understatement.  The cinematography alone could have made the movie.  Fortunately for Mr. Verbinski, he also got outstanding acting from everyone in the film.  The score fit perfectly into every scene and leaves your heart pounding again and again.  It's been a long time since a movie has kept me on the edge of my seat and this film should become a classic.  Move over Blair Witch, Sixth Sense, even The Exorcist and every other film that thought they had the throne of freakiest movie.  There's a new kid in town.",10,0,0,26 September 2002
Men in Black II," Was I watching a commercial?
","I use to think watching a movie was all about the movie.  I guess things have changed in the 21st century.  I like MIB II as a movie but I can't believe how many companies were shamelessly plugged throughout the film. Did Sonnefeld not see the final cut.  Surely Sony made plenty of money from the first one that there was no need for Sprint, Burger King, Mercedes, Ray Ban to pitch in right?  Maybe it's just me but I can't believe they would put so much good (Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Barry Sonnefeld) into a one hour and a half commercial.",7,0,0,2 July 2002
