Requiem for a Dream," Watch four hopeful, borderline desperate people suffer.
","This is not a 'feel good' movie. This is not Trainspotting.I loved Pi (same director as Requiem for a Dream) and I'm a big fan of the lovely Jennifer Connelly, and I heard that this was a good movie although Very Disturbing. Well, I thought I was ready since I've seen plenty of horror movies, a few 'drugs screw up some lives' shows, etc. Wrong. In this movie, you first become attached to the characters. Although you know their choices are the wrong ones, you want things to work out OK. Then, you get to watch as their lives are destroyed.This should definitely be mandatory viewing for rehab kids.",9,0,0,5 June 2001
Heat," WOW. Flawless. Wish I had seen this in the theater.
","Great acting, great directing, GREAT writing. A must see. I didn't notice the 3 hours zooming by; I'm glad they took the time to develop the characters and plot fully before the climax because it was worth it; I really wanted both the good guy and bad guy to win, and had no idea what was coming next.",10,0,0,22 May 2001
The Replacements," Very funny, if not terribly original.
","Boy, there are a lot of good actors in this movie. Obviously Keanu isn't one of them but he's in the movie anyway. He does a good job of being opaque (wooden?), and it's OK because his character calls for him to be a washed-up jock and to play football, so it's not important that he can't convey subtle emotions. As usual Orlando Jones is very funny, as is Rhys Ifans (previously seen in Notting Hill as basically the same character, except this time he's an athlete instead of a couch potato). The whole replacement team is full of amusing characters, and the cheerleaders are *really* funny. Lots of individual original jokes and situations but the plot follows the typical underdog sports movie storyline. A great rental.",7,0,1,25 June 2001
