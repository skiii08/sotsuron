The Monuments Men," Beautiful story of recovering art from Nazi looting in WWII.
","Frank convinces James, Richard, John, Jean Claude, and Donald to form the Monuments Men, a group dedicated to finding art looted by the Nazis and return it, if possible to owners. Most of them are middle-aged, but have to go through boot camp. They are not instantly respected by regular army.There are several detective stories to follow, and there are losses in war. They find a number of salt mines filled with art works. The Nazis also destroy a good bit of it, and the Russians 'liberate' a fair chunk of it themselves. Their support from the military grows when they discover a huge cache of gold bullion.Some of their last finds were of sculpture, which they find in a castle in Germany. Frank's interactions with Claire, a combination collaborator, resistance fighter, art historian, and cataloger, yield a manifest that helps them later on.How much of the obstruction by the Nazis and the Russians can they overcome?-----Scores-----Cinematography: 10/10 Wonderfully shot.Sound: 8/10 Good to excellent.Acting: 10/10 Quite good performances by a stellar cast.Screenplay: 10/10 Nice story telling.",10,0,0,15 June 2014
The Expendables 2," Needed a better screenplay, better lighting, more involved acting.
","The opening job is an extravaganza of bullets and explosions. It's successful.After they come back, Church (CIA contact) gives Barney an ultimatum: do a job or clear up that 5 million USD misunderstanding or go to jail. Maggie comes along as per Church's orders, and they retrieve an object from a safe, only to be hijacked by Villain. Villain kills Billy to get respect. Right. The team decides to track down Villain, who runs a mercenary for hire crew that tends to be on the opposite side of what Barney does.The lost object contains the location of a mine where the Russians store plutonium. The Bulgarian locations looked like a picture from 50 years ago. They meet up with Booker, who helps them in a fire fight.They encounter a group called the Sangs, who kidnap the men and teen boys to work in the mines. They set about to do in the Sangs, and recover the plutonium. When things look bad, Booker, Church, and Trench drop by with extra resources. There was a huge amount of shooting and dying.The movie more or less ends with the climactic fight between Van Damme and Stallone.In the end, Barney is all even with the CIA, the bad guys are defeated, and the plutonium is in safer hands. Even more, the sequel is setup.----Scores----Cinematography: 6/10 I expected better from a 92 million dollar budget.Sound: 7/10 Conversations often dip a bit low for my taste.Acting: 6/10 Big plus to Jet Li, for skill. Otherwise, some of the performances could have been phoned in.Screenplay: 6/10 There were too many incidences of 'we're in trouble, now someone will drop by to bail us out' for my taste.",6,2,4,3 October 2013
Iron Man 3," Tony's past comes back to haunt the USA.
","The Three Acts:The initial tableau: We open over a decade ago in Switzerland. Tony Stark participates wildly in end-of-the-year celebration parties. He meets Maya Hansen and Aldrich Killian, who try valiantly to convince him to be interested in technology developed by the think tank, AIM. Tony hardly listens, partly from buzz, partly from arrogance. He writes out a few equations which forward the effort considerably, gives them to Killian, and promises to meet Killian on the roof to develop the ideas further. But Tony breaks his promise.In the present, after Tony participates in The Avengers action in New York City, there are multiple attacks by 'The Mandarin.' Tony is not all that involved until his friend Happy Hogan is nearly killed by one of the attacks. Tony declares war. The Mandarin is backed by individuals who have the Extremis treatments developed by AIM. They can melt Tony's suits from the heat of their bodies, regenerate severed limbs, and many other things. Tony has his work cut out for him.Delineation of conflicts: 'The Mandarin' strikes first, destroying Tony's palatial estate on the California coast. Tony loses his armour, his labs, his base of operation, and soon enough, JARVIS and his suit. Or so it would seem. Tony has to figure out who the Mandarin really is, what AIM does, and how to counter the effects of Extremis, initially without his armour. Worst of all, the Extremis-enhanced folk capture Pepper, and start making her one of them. They kidnap War Machine (renamed Iron Patriot) and the President, whom they intend to replace using their own candidate. To make things even worse, Tony has recurrent PTSD from the action in New York.Resolution: Will the Extremis transformation applied to Pepper be reversible? Will the President be recovered alive? Will Colonel Rhodes get free to fight alongside Tony?------I never cared for the Mandarin, so I do not care about the portrayal of the Mandarin in IM3. I despised the character in the comics, and later hated the character in the animated series to the point that I gave up following Iron Man for a time. Only the Tony Stark films with RDJ in the cockpit got me interested again. What made Iron Man 1 great was the portrayal of Tony Stark coming back, against all odds, to defeat enemies of his own country, and enemies of his individual person. Iron Man 3 was a return to form after the wretched Iron Man 2. The third film was about Tony Stark, about his friends, about his fans who helped him when he was down, about the power of enduring love, which is what saved Stark in the end.",9,0,1,19 September 2016
John Wick," Excellent action/revenge film.
","The Three Acts:The initial tableau: In modern day greater New York/New Jersey, John Wick's wife Helen suddenly dies of a long lingering illness. His old acquaintance Marcus gives his condolences after the burial. He grieves for an interval. In the days after the wake, a puppy, Daisy, is delivered with a note from Helen. John and Daisy get to like each other. While out with Daisy getting gasoline, two Russian mobsters stop for gas at the same time. Iosef admires John's Mustang, and offers to buy either the car or the dog or both. John declines, and an older associate calls Iosef off. Iosef and two friends break into John's house, beat him up, ruin beautiful things, shoot Daisy, steal the Mustang, badly damage his newer car, and steal the bracelet of Helen's that John kept near him.Delineation of conflicts: Daisy was John's last living link with Helen. The necklace had similar importance. John wants vengeance on Iosef and on Viggo. Aurelio informs Viggo of Iosef's actions. Viggo understands the problem that Iosef has created. 'That f*ckin' nobody is John Wick.' he informs Iosef the idiot. He advises Iosef to get out of his sight. He asks his associate, Avi, to task all his available men to take on John. When that fails, he sets a bounty of 2 million USD on John's head, and also asks Marcus to do the job as soon as possible. Will Viggo live through this? Resolution: The many conflicts were resolved in what I thought were reasonable ways. I recommend this film to anyone who likes the genre.-------There are some great music tracks in this film, and the incidental music was well chosen. The actors were well miked, and I had no problems picking up dialog.For a revenge movie, this had a fine script. The direction and the plot lines certainly raised my hopes that John would succeed in everything that he tried. Plus, the end of Iosef is something I looked forward to from very early on. I seldom get that engaged with revenge films. I loved the humour between old pairs of friends while there were lulls in the action.",8,1,4,19 September 2016
World War Z," Smart plot about fast zombies that convert humans quickly.
","Parents Gerry and Mireille have a nice life, and the day starts normally. While taking their two daughters Constance and Abigail to school, the normal seeming traffic jam mutates into a full-blown disaster. They encounter full-fledged zombies who are very fast and very strong. The time interval between a zombie's bite and the victim turning seems to be about 12 seconds.Gerry is a former UN investigator/facilitator who got people or information out of hot spots around the world, often with help from US Special Forces of one sort or another. So the US/UN extracts him and his family after he makes his way to New Jersey. The escape from the zombies is close, and young Tomas helps them in the final steps. Tomas gets extracted with Gerry's family.Gerry is sent to North Korea with an epidemiologist. This does not go well, but Gerry does meet a CIA agent who gives him the next clue: the Israelis seem to be succeeding in repelling the zombies. So Gerry and the elite military go to Israel. On the way, they see a nuclear explosion in the far distance, and Gerry's contact with Karin is broken by the EMP.Israel's wall worked, more or less, but they did not understand that zombies are attracted by noise. Celebratory songs amplified by a PA system incite the zombies to scale the 45 foot walls, one undead body over another. Gerry does learn that zombies were detected in India well before the incidents in Korea. He heads to India, even though he has been told in no uncertain terms that India is a 'black hole' in terms of information flux. Gerry gets on the literal last plane out of Israel. He loses his UN escort, but gains Segen, an Israeli soldier whose hand he cut off...to save her from becoming a zombie.Gerry takes the Belarus flight that he is on to the last remaining airport open, which is in Cardiff, Wales, UK. Unfortunately, a zombie hid himself on the plane's lavatory, and soon starts infecting people. Gerry gets a new set of difficulties, including a plane crash and a metal spike through his gut. He and Segen trudge forward.Will Gerry make it to the WHO research facility? Will the information, which he has expressed to no one, come to light, and be put to good use? Will his family be safe? -----Scores-----Cinematography: 7/10 Mostly excellent, though some of the dark fight scenes wereSound: 8/10 No problems; though it might have been more effective for creepiness and suspense.Acting: 10/10 Excellent.Screenplay: 9/10 I liked it: action, suspense, quick thinking in difficult circumstances, and a plot that moved right along.

The Hunger Games," The film is mostly well-crafted, but highly overrated and derivative.
","In a sad dystopian future in the nation of Panem, the autocratic rulers celebrate the putting down of a past rebellion by an annual bloodletting. Two volunteers are chosen from each of 12 formerly rebellious districts. The twenty-four lucky contestants get to kill each other until only one survives.The training segment before the games was hugely improbable. The contestants are depicted as having terrible low-protein diets. How do they grow to any height, or have upright posture, or have impressive muscle tone? Absurd.Thirteen go down in the first eight hours. An alliance of five forms, and Peeta seems to be in it, rendering help in finding Katniss. She takes the strategy of going as far away as possible from the others. The game runners burn down the forest selectively to move her toward the other contestants. Her pursuers tree her, but decide to wait her out rather than take her down. Her sponsors send her a useful care package for her wounded leg via guided balloon.After the wasp incident, Katniss is in real trouble with hallucinations and indecision. On the other hand, she does get rid of some opponents.Katniss avoids, then defuses, a major trap back at the games entry point.She loses an ally (Rue) from district 11 and eliminates an enemy. Afterward, she flashes a sign to the district 11 observers. They go into rebellion mode. The motivation for this linkage was absent. Katniss' district 12 mentor Haymitch suggests to the powers that be an alternative involving two survivors.She takes a huge chance to get medical supplies for Peeta, and gets into a nasty knife fight for it. Saving Rue ended up saving Katniss, and one more competitor is eliminated.After Peeta's and Katniss' last human competitor is dead (or so they thought), they have to contend with an engineered, quite nasty pack of dogs, plus one wounded competitor re-surfaces. Peeta and Katniss prevail. Then the game runners revoke the two-survivor exception. Nice.----Scores----Cinematography: 7/10 Fine except for the sections of hellishly amateurish jerky camera movements and the ever so poor framing.Sound: 8/10 Mostly fine.Acting: 7/10 Sutherland, Tucci, Lawrence, Harrelson, and Hutcherson were fine, given the screenplay. Many of the supporting actors were not that good.Screenplay: 0/10 Yikes. The logical failures here are endless. The two-tiered society consists of many entitled high-tech parasitic consumers and few no tech impoverished producers. There is no way for the advanced materials used by the parasites to be produced, replaced, or upgraded. Where does the food and drink come from? Either there is a huge non-depicted segment of Panem society (doubtful) or the whole setup is just what it looks like: impossible, unmitigated nonsense. The opening remarks by President Snow were odious beyond belief, and would be sufficient to engender new rebellions, except for the abject poverty and lack of means of the downtrodden.",6,1,3,2 October 2013
Argo," Entertaining when considered as fiction; fine ensemble acting.
","During the storming of the US embassy in 1979, six American personnel escape to the Canadian embassy. The CIA puts together plans to get them out of Iran.The winning plan was to produce a Canadian science fiction movie shot in Iran. Tony flies to LA and gets together a director, a complete script that they own, a prosthetics genius, a walk-through of the script by a full cast of actors in full costume, and a storm of press coverage. In Iran, Tony convinces the six escapees to study up on their biographies as his crew.The relevant ministry gets the script for the fake film, Argo, and the press releases. He writes Tony that he wants to discuss locations with his crew the next day. The six learn their new identities as movie people. They meet with the minister at the appointed place. This is not without challenges along the way. Presenting the difference between American and Canadian has to be done now and then.In the night before the last day, the day to fly back, Tony grills the six on their backgrounds. After a long session of this, the movie tells us that Washington pulled the plug on the operation. So what do Tony and the group decide to do?No surprise. They go through with it. Jack in the CIA threatens Hamilton Jordan with embarrassment if it does not go through.The last piece was really delicate. The only Farsi speaker explains the story boards. The guard wants to verify with Los Angeles. Unfortunately, John and Lester are out of their office and blocked by filming. But they connect just in time, and the guard sees a story about Argo in the papers.Still, other parts of Iranian justice are after them, and the suspense continues. Will they make their flight and get into international air space? ------Scores-------Cinematography: 9/10 Good looking, even on DVD.Sound: 9/10 No problems.Acting: 10/10 Great performances by Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber, and Ben Affleck.Screenplay: 7/10 This account was strongly different than the one given to the public in 1980. At the time, the efforts of the Canadians were assigned roughly 100% of the credit for the plan and the successful execution. I remember feeling a great deal of kinship toward the Canadians at the time. Also, reactions from Canada in 2012 mirror the same view. So, accuracy was not set at a premium here. Considered as a fiction, however, this is an entertaining movie.",8,0,1,19 January 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Abrams' Star Trek; perhaps not Roddenberry's.
","In this second Star Trek film of the Abrams era, Kirk and Spock are still running the Enterprise, and are still doing it in amateurish fashion. However, there is a lot of action, excitement, and relief when difficulties are overcome.In completing the mission in the opening sequence, Kirk violates the prime directive in order to save Spock who was doing the last part of saving a new species of sentient beings. Sigh. Kirk loses command of the Enterprise.Admiral Pike finagles getting Kirk to be his First Officer just before there is an attack on a critical Star Fleet installation. The attack leads to a high level conclave of Star Fleet officers. Kirk figures this out just before the attack, and manages to blunt (but not stop) its effects. There are heavy losses. Kirk gets back the Enterprise, and is ordered to find and kill the perpetrator. His crew is given special weapons to accomplish this.Kirk's quarry is traced to a deserted part of Kronos, the Klingon homeworld. The quarry's real name is Khan who is the maximal result of a eugenics experiment done many years earlier on Earth. Admiral Marcus (Pike's superior) had hoped to use Khan against an array of future enemies, such as the Klingons. Khan and Marcus had a falling out, though, and the whole dynamics of the film is derived from that.For the Federation to be brought back to an even keel, Marcus' vision of endless war has to be put aside, and Khan has to be contained somehow. Just to make things for fun, Carol Marcus, the daughter of the Admiral, stows away on the Enterprise.So, will the Enterprise crew be up for it? -----Scores-----Cinematography: 7/10 For the most part, the blending of CGI with real photography was well done. I saw why there are so many posted complaints about lens flare, however.Sound: 6/10 The often symphonic music seemed an odd choice, and only amplified my misgivings about the film.Acting: 7/10 Good, except for the miscasting of the pivotal character Khan. I liked the performances of Karl Urban, John Cho, Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin, Bruce Greenwood, and Peter Weller quite a lot.Screenplay: 5/10 Usually, I watch action films in one sitting with no breaks whatsoever. This property took me four days to watch, since it just did not interest me that much, at any stage. The three principals all seemed emotionally childish and short of training for their chosen profession. It seemed utterly unlikely that such incompetence could produce good results in very difficult situations.",6,1,2,24 May 2014
The Babadook," This film is 93 minutes of witnessing ongoing willful self-delusion.
","This is a psychological drama where the protagonist refuses to resolve her own self-generated difficulties. There was no character to identify with in the film. As the film progressed to the ten minute mark, my empathetic response to the self- destructive protagonist had already evaporated. So, who cares?Netflix classifies this hot mess as Thriller, Independent Thriller, Psychological Thriller. At least they did not mark it as 'horror.' Also, Thriller? Really? There is nothing thrilling (or even engaging) about this descent into the outer boundaries of stupidity.The Movie Database (TMDb) calls it Drama (yes), Thriller (no), and Horror (no). The film had no body horror, no serial killers, no gore-fest. The madness aspect was all fake, so the supposed supernatural elements were each and every one fake. What aspect of horror is this misstep supposed to represent?Rotten Tomatoes marked the genres as Drama, Horror, Mystery and Suspense. There is no suspense here since there were no real threats involved. The protagonist's pathology was set clearly during the first 45 seconds. The mystery, I suppose, was whether she would decide to get well. The other mystery is why RT rated this dog so highly.There are so many dull stretches in this film. At times I thought I was watching Paranormal Activity without the jump scares. Also, watching full-screen, low resolution badly taped ancient television is just boring, whether or not the protagonist thinks she sees something in the childish images. There is nothing there, just the wandering consciousness of a sleep-deprived weakling who has given up on life.",1,22,44,13 September 2016
Oldboy," This is the best of the three Vengeance films in my view.
","The film opens with Oh holding a business man by his necktie to keep him from dropping off a building.Flashback to Oh in a police precinct for extreme public drunkenness. A friend comes to pick him up. While the friend talks to his wife, Oh walks off. Years pass while he is imprisoned.He gets to watch a newscast that claims he killed his wife. He has a bit of a breakdown at that point, seeing ants coming out of his flesh and the like.He writes lists of all his wrongdoings and the people he has offended. It's more than half a dozen notebooks.Early on, he tries to kill himself, several times. He gets over this, and starts to keep track of time and to tone his muscles.After 15 years, he is dumped in a suitcase on the top of the building he was held in. The man in the first scene was a suicide. Oh tells the suicide his story, then does not listen to the other man's story. Nice. 'Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Cry, and you cry alone.' This was on the wall in his cell; he repeats it, laughing, after the suicide kills himself.Oh's house is gone, demolished and replaced. His relatives and friends think he killed his wife, so he cannot contact them.An encounter with street thugs shows his training paid off. Some stranger gives him a mobile phone and a wallet with money. A 'scholar of Oh Dae-su' calls him, and they have an oblique talk.He and a chef at the first restaurant he visits strike it off quickly. She helps him find what he is looking for.He finds the prison from the taste of fried dumplings. He finds an audio tape of the person who commissioned his imprisonment. The prison had a lot of guards, and he did a lot of fighting to get free of them.'Revenge or the truth? That's a problem for you.' Great line. In this case, truth was the ultimate revenge.The mystery is quite intricate, and the protagonist needs much help to resolve it. One needs a strong stomach to finish the material, but the film is well worth finishing.Cinematography: 9/10Sound: 8/10 Music was a bit much for a few minutes of the film.Acting: 10/10 The adversaries were excellent, as were several of the supporting players.Screenplay: 10/10 Exceptional storytelling.",10,0,5,14 September 2013
Constantine," In the Catholic mythos sub-genre, my favourite.
","The Three Acts:The initial tableaux: The titles say, 'The Spear of Destiny' has been missing since the end of World War II. So what is this spear? Perhaps we will find out.In the present day, Manuel and friend are sifting debris. Manuel almost falls through some rotten floor boards. Beneath the boards he discovers a spearhead wrapped in a Nazi flag. He walks away from his friend with the spearhead, but is immediately hit by a car. He receives a mark, then rises and trots away, seemingly unharmed. What could this mean?In the second thread, John Constantine and his allies watch for incursions from hell, and act against them as best they can. Hennessy calls John for an exorcism, and the type of demon that John scotches tells him that something is afoot.In the third thread, Detective Angela asks her priest for guidance. Her twin Isabel commits suicide. Angela is at a loss.Delineation of conflicts: Lucifer and company have plans for broaching the barriers to invading Earth.

The Day After Tomorrow," Dealing with an outlandishly sudden Ice Age in 2004.
","Paleoclimatologist Jack witnesses some impressive breakups of polar ice. He discusses this during a conference. He gets a lot of scoffing, even when he predicts changes to the Atlantic currents that will likely bring on an ice age in 100 or 1000 years.Terry Rapson starts noticing some huge current anomalies. He convinces Jack to plug the current data into Jack's models for paleo-environments. Jack demurs at first; his model is not meant for making predictions. Jack adapts his work and fills in the data.While Jack is adapting and applying, odd weather shows up all over North America and Europe.

The Way Back," The film depicts a long, heroic trek to freedom across Siberia, Mongolia, Tibet, the Himalayas to India.
","In September 1939, Nazi Germany and Communist USSR partitioned Poland. Many who were in Soviet Poland were imprisoned in Siberia for being politically incorrect. That includes being foreign, being an actor, having advocated freedoms in the past, and other things.A group escapes from a gulag during World War II, and journey on foot 4000 miles from Siberia across Tibet to freedom in India. The Soviets have offered bounties to any of the locals who capture prisoners.A party of seven starts the journey and gets away. They face a lot of problems: blinding snow, the ever-present cold, lack of food, hallucinations, each other. They head for Lake Baikal. They soon lose a member who has night blindness, which was sad since he was 50 feet from the rest and their fire when he froze to death. Later, it becomes clear that they got lost on the way. Their best scout sets out to find the lake, and comes back in terrible shape. Fortunately, he did find it.Irena joins them near the lake. When they encounter the first lake-side town, Valka goes looking for food, and finds some, and steals some vodka. As they move south, there are more people and more mosquitoes. A lucky encounter with locals tells them how to make mosquito repellent necklaces. Irena increases communications among the group.Further south, near the Mongolian border, they start seeing Soviet military again. Valka decides to stay in Siberia. At the Mongolian border, they discover (how would they have known?) that Mongolia had fallen to the Communist imperialist expansion. So their hopes for freedom are dashed. The shots of the burned out Buddhist temple were heart-breaking. They decide to walk to Tibet, to the Himalayas, to India and British influence.The desert areas are hard on them. Irena's health fails, and they leave her corpse behind; the party is now down to five. Kazik dies a few days later. The four survivors admire his sketches which he had kept from the gulag on. When they catch sight of the mountains, Smith decides not to go on, and they leave him behind. Later he revives and catches up with them.They find plenty of water at the base of the Himalayas.

","Set in 1942, first in the eastern USA, then in the European theatre of World War II, Allies versus Nazis. The scrawny and sickly Steve Rogers tries to enlist in the military so as to go to war in Europe. He gets rejected repeatedly. Dr. Erskine notices his moxie, however, and arranges for him to be inducted anyway for purposes of human experimentation. The experiment works, and the CGI Steve Rogers gets 'changed' into the real-life Chris Evans.The opposite number to Dr. Erskine and his group is HYDRA, a Nazi group that does weapons research, among other things.

American Hustle," A tense, dramatic thriller with fine plot and character exposition.
","Irving is a semi-legitimate business man who owns a glass replacement business plus several dry cleaning stores. He sells paintings of dubious provenance, and 'arranges' loans that might otherwise be hard to get. Irving is married to Rosalyn, but is invigorated by his falling in love with the talented Sydney. Sydney wants Irving to leave Rosalyn, but recognises that Rosalyn is an even better con artist than either of them. Working with Sydney, Irving's various dealings go better, and the quality of clients improves. Their future looks bright and rich.FBI agent Richie Dimaso pulls a sting on the pair, and uses the evidence collected to leverage Irving and Sydney to help the FBI. What Richie wants is for Irving to mastermind a sting against some New Jersey politicians, including Mayor Polito. This effort moves forward. When it was about to bear fruit, Richie fouls the sting by deviating from Irving's plan, and Carmine leaves the meeting.Irving and Sydney save the day. Irving gets Carmine to trust him; this was a major effort. Sydney helps the FBI come up with just enough good faith money to convince Carmine and his people that they have a serious investor (a sheik) to re-energise the rebuilding of Atlantic City. Irving's friendship with Carmine continues to deepen, and Carmine insists that Rosalyn get to know him and Dolly socially. Rosalyn takes to this social whirl very quickly.Richie loses his composure when things work despite his foul-ups. He keeps pushing the FBI to make larger attempts to get bigger stings. He also pushes Sydney harder to leave Irving, and be with him. On the other side of the coin, news traveled fast in gambling circles, and large figures such as Victor Tellegio join the field of interest. Victor insists on 10 million in good faith money, and that the sheik become a US citizen practically overnight to ensure that everyone is satisfied about the legitimacy of the operation.To resolve the citizenship issue would require an act of Congress. To get that through in a short amount of time, some shuffling of money might expedite the process. Irving and Sydney help set this up. The FBI is definitely interested in who accepts such money and who does not. The 10 million in good faith money gets handled in another operation.In the end, who comes out as winners?

Nightcrawler," Freelance thief becomes a freelance TV cameraman.
","The Three Acts:The initial tableaux: It's night time in Los Angeles, and Louis Bloom is out acquiring copper wire, chain link fence, and manhole covers to sell to a scrap operator. That is, he steals these materials from insufficiently secure sites. He also listens to audio courses on entrepreneurship as he cruises the city looking for weakness. He's not above beating the hell out of a security guard in order to get free of him, but more to steal his pricey watch.Louis is clearly looking for something more monetarily rewarding. By chance he stops at a recent auto accident that might get worse if the car explodes before the CHP can get the driver out of the car. A freelance TV film crew (Joe Loder and his assistant) show up, as if on cue, and start filming. Louis starts the process of learning new skills. He observes the handling of the situation that involves cops, aggressive reporters, victim(s), the excitement of jeopardy, straight up corruption, electronic surveillance, and the hungry market of TV news. When he sees the incident on TV at home the next morning, he's hooked.Delineation of conflicts: There is competition among the freelance film camera crews (stringers), especially those who film crime oriented events for television. Louis enters that competition. He catches the attention of a morning news director at an LA TV station, Nina Romina. His relationship with her is stormy, but they both gain from it. As his success grows (better car, better camera, better access), Louis becomes impatient for more success. He moves incrementally from pure observer to active participant in the crime scenes. The jostling with other stringers continues, and his self-created legal jeopardy increases.Resolution: Character issues lead to consequences, but where do those consequences land?",8,0,0,3 October 2016
Bridge of Spies," Cold War bargaining.
","The Three Acts: The initial tableaux: In 1957, the FBI arrests Rudolf Abel for espionage against the United States. For propaganda reasons, not for being true to American ideals, the powers that be select James to be the council of Abel. James tries to represent Abel well, and receives stiff resistance for his efforts. He does establish that the US should treat its prisoners well at least for the hope that our imprisoned soldiers or agents will receive reasonable behavior from jailers.In 1960, the Russians shoot down the U2 reconnaissance plane flown by Francis Gary Powers over the USSR, and imprison him afterward. Powers has a great deal of classified intelligence that might be divulged. The Russians want Abel back; the Americans want Powers back.Delineation of conflicts: James is 'requested' to negotiate the swap, but is not given diplomatic recognition, and must work as a private citizen. The East Germans detain Pryor, an economics PhD student as a spy to use as a chess piece.James has to deal with a lot of murkiness, since none of the transactions are done officially. He has to deal with the Russians to get Powers, and the East Germans to get Pryor. The Russians and East Germans have their own agendas.Resolution: There's a lot of juggling, but it turns out relatively well.",9,1,3,2 December 2016
American Psycho," Great visuals undone by script and direction as well as inconsistent sound capture and editing.
","The protagonist talks directly to the viewer. This is bovine scatology. The entire film is about a delusional protagonist, so nothing is to be trusted in the plot lines, such as they are. Just because some action is depicted on the screen does not mean that it happened outside the sour operations of this afflicted mind. One might as well be suffering through Walter Mitty, except that the lead has bloody fantasies instead of Mitty's pleasant ones.So, since nothing of the exposition is to be trusted, what is the point of this vile mess?As one navigates through this maze of false threads, that is the central question. The hideous ending casts everything even deeper in doubt. The film is reminiscent of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) which was heaped with praise since Terry Gilliam directed it. That does not change the fact that after watching the film, one wonders whether Depp's character did any of the actions shown on screen. In American Psycho, the disappointment was much stronger because the production values were so much higher. Whereas FLiLV looked sleazy, AP looked exquisite; interspersed with the shock segments, that is. I expected some sort of value for having suffered through the recurring horrific images, the type one expects from a slasher film or a mild gore-fest, but done by someone like Hitchcock.If American Psycho is considered as a collage, bits of the film were good for witty conversation or for commentary on the 1980s and the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent. The collage as a whole, though, is just an incoherent collection of high quality materials badly assembled. The last two minutes were almost interesting, but the rest of the film did not support the message. The effect as a whole is doubled: who cares? It is all delusion and of no point at all.",5,0,1,12 September 2016
Van Helsing," A wonderfully constructed remix of modern fantasy themes.
","The Three Acts:The initial tableau: There is a lot going on in this film. The initial context comes from four vignettes: (1) Doctor Frankenstein has successfully brought life to his cobbled together monster. Dracula, who funded Frankenstein, figures that his investment has borne fruit, and kills the doctor. The monster is enraged by this, and manages to escape Dracula and the mob with their torches. Dracula recruits Igor.(2) Van Helsing confronts Mr. Hyde in Paris at the behest of a secret group operating out of the Vatican. In doing such work, Van Helsing has become a wanted criminal of international renown. He has no public support whatsoever, and is hated by many.(3) At the Vatican, Van Helsing is dressed down by Cardinal Jinette. He gets a new assignment: to protect the Valerian family (Anna and Velkan), and to help them kill Count Dracula in a fulfillment of a family oath. The oath was that the family would not enter Heaven until Dracula was destroyed. Van Helsing meets the friar named Carl, who is both timid and talented.(4) Velkan and Anna attempt to trap the werewolf that has been terrorising the village. Velkan kills the werewolf, but is bitten in the process.Delineation of conflicts: Velkan becomes a rather powerful werewolf. Dracula would use Velkan for his own purposes. Van Helsing and Anna have a chewy first meeting, then agree to oppose Dracula's intentions toward Velkan.Dracula and his trio of mates (Aleera, Verona, and Marishka) want their undead offspring to have life. Van Helsing, Anna, and the Vatican want them to die: Van Helsing, to follow orders; Anna, to save her family from Purgatory; the Vatican, to drive the spawn of Satan from the face of the Earth.Frankenstein's monster would like to live in peace with some degree of freedom. Dracula wants to consume him to transfer life to his offspring. The Vatican wants the monster dead since he's not precisely human, and his life was not given to him by God. Carl would like to comply with the Vatican's wishes, but cannot in good conscience.Dracula wants Van Helsing dead for strong reasons of his own. Van Helsing, Carl, Anna, and the monster are opposed.Resolution: Excellent, difficult, and harmonious.",9,1,4,20 September 2016
Divergent," Teen's coming of age in a factionalized future dystopia.
","The film is set in the remains of Chicago in a post-apocalyptic dystopian city state. Society is segmented into five factions (dauntless, abnegation, erudite, candor, amity) plus the Factionless. Those in the factions are privileged, while the Factionless are impoverished. The abnegation faction controls government. The film, in short, involves the attempted mutiny of dauntless and erudite to replace abnegation as the rulers.Young people in this society are faced with a choice in their late teens: to choose a faction. Each teen is given a test to help determine the faction, but the teen's choice is the determining factor, not the test.Tris (well, Beatrice), daughter of Natalie and Eric, sister of Caleb, gets an inconclusive test. Tori, who administered the test, advises her to just leave and say the test was flawed. Tris does this. On the day of choosing, she chooses dauntless over her family's faction, abnegation.The story follows Tris' acclimatisation into dauntless and her involvement with the unspoken motives of dauntless and erudite against abnegation. The other central theme is her flawed test. What really happened there?This is the first installment of a trilogy, and some of the first moves of dauntless plus erudite against abnegation are detailed.-----Scores------ Cinematography: 8/10 Reasonable skill was shown.Sound: 6/10 I could make out the words that the actors spoke. The background music was between insipid and irritating.Acting: 3/10 I liked the performances of Ashley Judd, Kate Winslett, and Theo James. The rest of the cast was well worth forgetting.Screenplay: 0/10 Boring, not involving, not believable.-----Conclusions----- This is another exercise set in a dystopia that is simply not possible...so who cares? There was nothing to balance that: nothing and no one to bring identification, or empathy, or involvement. This film is in the YA female demographic. One line summary: Teen's coming of age in a factionalized future dystopia. Two stars of five. Recommendation: fine if you are in the demographic.",4,0,0,12 February 2015
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A poor film despite an interesting plot idea and veteran actors.
","Hansel and Gretel are told to wait in the woods by their father. He does not come back. They investigate a candy house, are captured by a hideous witch, and manage to kill her and escape instead of being eaten.As they grow older, they save captured children, and kill offending witches. This goes on into their adulthood. They have reputations and expertise, and their services come at a price.The film moves forward to the 'present' when Hansel and Gretel are adults. In the German village of Augsburg, children are missing and Mina is accused of witchcraft by Sheriff Berringer. He starts the rituals to prove she is a witch. In this case, drowning: if Mina drowns, she's not a witch; otherwise she is one. Hansel and Gretel prevent this. They are hired by the mayor to find the kidnapped children.They find a witch who is not the kidnapper, but also find a document indicating that a holy day for witches is coming up: the rise of the Blood Moon. This is a once in a generation event, and will occur in three days. The children are likely part of the ceremonies. The sheriff gathers a posse to find the children in competition.Orchestrating events from the witch side is Muriel, a Grand Witch who can change appearances. The lesser witches have hideous skin, ugly teeth, and strange voices. All the witches have prodigious strength and speed. Muriel manages to collect a child born in each month of the calendar year, so her readiness for the Blood Moon progressed right along.Hansel and Gretel get separated, and things get even worse. When the sheriff was about to kill Gretel, a troll named Edward saves her. Min helps Hansel, who was left hanging from a tree. They re-connect, then discover their childhood home. Muriel informs them of a few details of their childhood that they had been missing, particularly facts about their mother Adrianna and their father.The dark witches need Gretel's heart to complete their Blood Moon rituals. Mina and Hansel discover a powerful book among Adrianna's possessions. They set off with Ben to stop the ritual and recover Gretel.Will Ben, Mina, and Hansel, possibly with Edward's help, be able to stop Muriel's grand plans? If so, will they free the children?------Scores-------Cinematography: 10/10 Better than I expected.Sound: 6/10 Ineffective for the most part.Acting: 5/10 Peter Stormare, Famke Janssen, and Jeremy Renner were rather good. Gemma Arterton and Pihla Viitala were between forgettable and bad. Thomas Mann's performance was horrid.Screenplay: 0/10 Referring to 'hillbillies' in late medieval Europe is a stupid and ridiculous anachronism, as was Ben's using modern fan speak. The use of a phonograph in the late Middle Ages is out of the question, as were the taser, the hypodermic injector, modern shotguns, repeating rifles, Gatling guns, and electric heart resuscitation devices.

The Grand Budapest Hotel," Funny, touching, bizarre, and well worth the watch.
","Setup and PlotWe start the film with an Author, in his later years, doing a video recording. He then promises to tell the audience how he came to know a particular story.We switch back to 1968, when the Young Writer was staying at the Grand Budapest Hotel, which was in its fading, twilight years. The Young Writer meets Mr. Moustafa, who tells him the story of how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel.We switch back to 1932; the new Lobby Boy (Zero) begins his tutelage with M. Gustave. Gustave likes older, rich, blonde women, and he romances them. In particular, Madame D. is quite fond of him. She is on a trip, and has a presentiment of death. Sure enough, she dies in the town where she traveled to. Gustave and Zero hurry to see her, and are there in time to hear the reading of the will. The surprise is that she willed the priceless painting 'Boy with Apple' to Gustave. The family is furious, and Gustave is accused of her murder, but not before Zero and he secreted the painting.Mr. Moustafa pauses to describe his relationship to Agatha, who works in the bakery of the hotel. Agatha helps in the escape of Mr. Gustave. Then Moustafa returns to the investigation of Madame D's death, and the process of bringing the probate to a legally sound close.Mr. Gustave, with the aid of Zero and four fellow prisoners, escapes prison. Gustave reaches for help from his fellow concierge friends.In the counter-theme, Dmitri and his cohort Jopling, pursue Gustave for the sake of the painting, mostly.Will anyone find Serge, supposedly the real culprit in the death of Madame D. ?

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A fast, smart, exciting ride, start to finish.
","Budapest. IMF agent Hanaway is betrayed and killed by Moreau, who takes the intelligence he had intercepted.Moscow. Jane and Benji break Ethan out of a jail to re-take the lost information. Ethan changes plans to take along a new ally from the prison. This rather complicates things for a bit. The Secretary re-tasks Ethan, Benji, and Jane to get vital information (nuclear codes) from inside the Kremlin. That starts out fairly well, but Cobalt (Hendricks) gets the codes first, and blames them for it. Ethan is captured, and narrowly escapes. He learns from the Secretary that the IMF has been disavowed. The Secretary himself gets killed, but not before telling Ethan what he wants done off the record. The team is cut off from direct support from American channels. Cobalt is out to kill him. The Russian police (Sidirov) are after them on criminal charges. Brandt joins the team.Dubai. Cobalt sends Wistrom to buy the launch codes from Moreau. The team sets up a double meet, so that Leonid and Wistrom meet Jane, and Moreau meets Ethan and William, but they both think they are meeting each other. What could possibly go wrong? There were some great stunts in this segment, including the chase in the sandstorm.Mumbai. Cobalt has the launch codes and the satellite uplink. So he needs a 'tactical satellite' as the last piece. That is, a satellite that has Russian military protocols still in it. One is available in Mumbai. Jane goes after Brij Nath, the man who has access to the satellite. Benji and William go after the man's computer security system. Cobalt again interrupts them. After Cobalt takes control of the satellite, Ethan and Jane rush to make a last minute stop. Cobalt gets a Russian missile launched. Jane, William, and Benji race to re-enable the uplink, while Ethan rushes to acquire the case with the command codes.Seattle.

Jack Reacher," Good tension and plot resolution, with lots of difficulties along the way.
","The film opens with a sniper killing five people at extreme long range. From evidence at the scene, the police pick up James Barr, a psychopath sniper just discharged from the Army under suspicious circumstances. He signs a confession, and makes a request in writing, 'Get Jack Reacher.' He's put in the general population, and is soon beaten into a coma.DA Rodin and Det Emerson decide to track Reacher down, but this proves moot. Reacher meets them in the DA's office. Barr's defense lawyer, Rodin's daughter Helen, manages to engage Reacher as her investigator.Someone sets up Reacher at a bar, and he's arrested. Helen, her father, Emerson, and Reacher discuss this with some heat. Reacher gets more interested.As Jack gets closer to the truth, the stakes get higher, and it becomes clear who the real culprits are. Jack even finds evidence to prove Barr is innocent.

She is a new analyst for the CIA in Pakistan shortly after the 2001 attacks.When Maya's friend Jessica, plus six other CIA operatives, are killed by al Qaeda, Maya becomes even more focused on finding bin Laden and seeing to it that he is killed.The film concludes with the successful raid by Seal Team Six on the compound where bin Laden had been staying in Pakistan.------Scores-------Cinematography: 8/10 The extended night-vision sequences were low on detail.

Scream 2," Gale from Scream writes a book that becomes a movie; the well of revenge is not empty yet.
","Since the happenings of the previous film, Gale wrote a book, The Woodsboro Murders, which becomes a movie called Stab.We follow a black couple into a showing of the film, which reminds me of showings of Rocky Horror Picture Show that I've experienced. The audience is largely costumed, the theatre operates some props, and the audience brings some 'required' stuff. The couple get knifed to death, separately, which establishes the context of the rest of the picture.So, we're in the self-referential environment of Scream, but with the passage of time, and an evolution in the setting.The film class discussion of original movies versus sequels went on too long. Like Scream, this is just over the top self-regarding nonsense, with too much discussion of particular movies within another movie.Gale arranges a meeting between Cotton and Sidney, without telling Sidney. Even Cotton thought that was a bit much. Sidney hits Gale again, during filming. Dewey is displeased with Gale for her characterization of him in her book as Barney Fife. Ish.Sidney might pledge at Delta Lambda Zeta, so we have another mini-universe of clichés to exploit. Cici is at the Omega Beta Zeta house, and becomes the next victim in the cycle. Back at the mixer, Portia di Rossi's eyebrows were hideous. The attention quickly shifts from the mixer to Cici's death and the swarming of cops and reporters.The costumed assailant attacks Sidney in the DLZ house after the crowd has left. Derek gets stabbed, but far from fatally. The next morning, there is a lot of assessment and not enough facts. Dewey, the Sheriff, and Gale notice a pattern in the names of the new victims versus the principals in the earlier case.Sidney gets invited by Gus Gold to play Cassandra. The costumes in the play are more than a bit reminiscent of the murderer's Halloween get up. Also, they have knives, so this was not such a great idea.Randy gets killed in Gale's van while it's on the quad; Sidney gets a death threat in the library. Goodness. Cotton has a talk with Sidney in the school library; she wants to leave, he won't have it; he starts yelling like everything while still in the library. The cops take him in for an alternate discussion.Dewey and Gale pore over footage from recent crime scenes, looking for the culprit. That worked out fairly well for the killer. Dewey has a more than rough spot; the killer rushes off to go after Sidney and Hallie.The picture wraps up hard and fast after that.----Scores-----Cinematography: 10/10 Good-looking picture.Sound: 10/10 Fine, no problems.Acting: 7/10 Not as good as the original. Liev Schreiber was an improvement over Matthew Lillard, but he did not make up for the presence of Pinkett-Smith or Jerry O'Connell. Sarah Michelle Gellar was a plus in her short performance, but Tori Spelling was the gaping black hole of non-acting one expects.Screenplay: 6/10 The endless references to clichés in other films drags this down a bit. Some of the acting is sufficient to carry the story forward.",7,1,1,11 November 2013
Scream," An otherwise excellent film spoiled by its endless spoofing.
","Casey and Steve get killed in the opening sequence, which sets much of the tone of the rest of the film.The next day, the school where Casey and Steve had attended is abuzz with the news, and the local television channels are overflowing with it.Sidney sat next to Casey in school, and her mother was assaulted and killed the year before. The culprit was not apprehended. A lot of the attention of the film flows to Sidney, her boyfriend Billy, plus their friends Stuart and Tatum. Deputy Dewey knows Sidney from the year before.We see the same MO working against Sidney the next night. The perpetrator tells Sidney that her mother did not want to die. Billy gets arrested for it. Sidney gets to thinking about the two murder incidents, and the cops have a costume that looks like the one the perpetrator used.Gail Weathers and her hapless, overweight cameraman Kenny try to get the story first. Sidney cold cocks her, but apologizes the next morning. Gale, on the other hand, insists that Sidney's mother was a slut, and that Sidney identified the wrong man at the trial.Her classmates are more than a bit crude and insensitive. Two of the boys wear a Halloween costume that resembles the one used by the killer. Some of the girls speculate whether Sidney did the murders, and whether is was a pathetic cover up. The killer finds her in the girls' room at school, and Sidney gets away via some good scrambling.As the story progresses, the principal gets killed, Sidney's friend Tatum is killed, her boyfriend Billy gets knifed twice in the gut, Kenny gets his throat slit, and a couple more people get killed.When the guilty are revealed, it makes sense from the earlier parts of the film. Loose ends are tied up.-------Scores-------Cinematography: 10/10 Exceptional.Sound: 10/10 Well done.Acting: 10/10 Fine. Neve Campbell and Skeet Ulrich gave particularly good performances.Screenplay: 6/10 Too clever. Too referential to the genre. Too many references to other movies.

The Purge," Yet another elimination derby, this time among the wealthy.
","Father James Sandin, mother Mary, daughter Zoey, and son Charlie are a nuclear family who are quite well-to-do. They live in year is 2022, after the actions of the 'New Founding Fathers,' who revamped the failed United States. One of their innovations is the 12 hour periods, once a year, when nothing is illegal. These periods are The Purge, when pent up anger results in massive loss of life, especially among the poor or the disconnected.James sells security systems that work 99% of the time. Great. The biggest threats to the family's safety are (1) Charlie, who lets in a wounded victim and (2) Zoey, whose boyfriend stows away in the home/fortress just before the Purge starts. Giving sanctuary to the victim results in the organised attack on the household by well-to-do marauders who want the victim so they can finish killing him.The film is about the outside attackers assailing the household, and the family's decisions on how to deal with it. Their target is not the family, but the family's stupidity turns the family into an additional target. Will the attackers break in? That's easy to guess. Will they leave anyone alive? Are they the only threat?There are some interesting ideas here, but the execution just sucked. The only bright spot for me (the reason I gave it a 1/5 instead of 0/5) was watching Ethan Hawke defend his home vigorously against home invaders. That gave a few moments of feeling of righteous revenge, which was rather fleeting.",2,1,1,7 September 2016
Godzilla," Godzilla saves humanity from the mutos in an 8 minute appearance.
","Setup and PlotIn the opening sequence, Joe Brody, his wife Sandra and son Ford are in Japan. Joe and Sandra work at a project that aims to contain some unexplained phenomena involving huge amounts of energy and a partially buried large object. The object turns out to be living, breaks much of the containment apparatus, and causes widespread tragedy. A heavier blanket of secrecy is applied.Jump forward to the present. Ford is grown up, is in the US armed services, and has a wife Elle and son Sam in San Francisco. Ford gets a call from Joe, then goes to Japan to get him out of jail. While Ford helps out Joe, the object (a 'muto') revives, breaks free this time, and flies away, leaving even more destruction and death than in years before.A second, larger muto awakens in Nevada. The two mutos are tracked by the US Navy, which is now actively involved. The mutos' activity awakens Godzilla from his long slumber in the Pacific.Ford and Dr. Serizawa are drawn into the military's quest to contain the mutos. Elle and Sam are at risk as the three giants converge on San Francisco.ObservationsTrue to tradition in Godzilla movies, human activity is depicted as futile. Most human efforts against giant monsters have no noticeable effect. The rest of our efforts catalyse the monsters to rain down more destruction on human cities and military personnel.In a few of the many Godzilla films I have seen, a child is rescued, or a trapped helpless person is released. But for each such action, thousands of human lives are lost, and tens of billions of dollars of real estate value are zeroed out. The contrast accentuates the helplessness of the human race against forces it cannot control and never will control.In a slight departure from what I'm used to in the Godzilla universe, a human being does something that will make the survival of the human race more likely. Watch the film; you can't miss it.Godzilla causes a huge amount of property damage and loss of life, though not nearly as much as the mutos cause. The case could be made that Godzilla in this film, as in many others, is indifferent to the fate of the human race. He does in the mutos in order to get back to his snooze beneath the Pacific.ScoresCinematography: 8/10 Some of the SFX were cheesy, but most were fabulous.Sound: 7/10 Few complaints. I could hear the dialog. The music was not too irritating.Acting: 6/10 Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn, and Sally Hawkins were fine in their limited roles. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance was both boring (beginning) and believably heroic (toward the end), so I ended up liking him.Screenplay: 6/10 The director stayed true to the franchise, but with updated SFX and a few other adjustments. The holes in the plot, though, seemed endless.",7,2,3,13 February 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Mockumentary of vampire life in New Zealand.
","The Three Acts: The initial tableaux: Four vampires live in a flat together in New Zealand. Viago (from the 18th century) was a European dandy before he turned, and is the fussy one. Deacon (183 years old) had been a vampire Nazi, and needed to leave Europe after the war. Petyr is some 8 thousand years old, and does not get out much. Vlad is a bit older than Viago, but considerably younger than Petyr. Vlad was a noble who commanded armies and could do all sorts of animal transformations.Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon prepare for a night out in Wellington. They cannot get into most clubs because they have to be invited in. However, there is a club just for vampires. Jackie is Deacon's familiar. She does all sorts of scut work for him, such as procuring victims, washing dishes, and whatever else.After Petyr turns Nick, the main part of the story begins.Delineation of conflicts: The vampires' night life activities in Wellington bring them into contact with humans. This is pretty limited until Nick joins them and is still able to get into the newer night clubs. They encounter werewolves and the changed relationships with their old friends. Nick does not feel any need for secrecy, which rather disturbs the older vampires.Jackie wants Deacon to change her to vampire, but Deacon prefers she remain his familiar. Deacon does not treat her well, either.

Inside Llewyn Davis," Another fine film from the Coen brothers; catch it if you can.
","The film opens in the Gaslight Cafe in 1961 in New York City in the deep of winter. Llewyn Davis gives a beautiful performance, then goes out to meet somebody who wants to talk to him. The somebody beats the nonsense out of LLewyn. At this point, I was a bit low on context, and was not all that interested in the rest of the film. Fortunately, I stayed.The film ends on a repeat of the same scene. The difference was that more information was given in the scene the second time, and everything made perfect sense. In the repeat, one knows where Llewyn was going and why.The large majority of the film is about exploring how Llewyn got to the final scene. We meet Mitch and Lillian's cat, which escaped, causing all sorts of problems for Llewyn as he tries to get it back to his friends.We meet Jim and Jean, who used to be in an act with Llewyn. We see in great detail why that is no longer true. Jim helps Llewyn get some studio work; Llewyn's haste denied him future income because he would not go through proper paperwork. His agent Mel does not seem to be doing anything for him.After the studio session with Jim, LLewyn goes to Chicago to talk to Bud Grossman, another figure in the music business. On the way he shares gas and driving with Roland and Johnny. He gets some alternate points of view, and something that was at least intended to be a curse. He makes it to Chicago, despite the troubles that Johnny and Roland encountered.Bud gives Llewyn a fair hearing, is not shocked that Mel did nothing for him, and even offers Llewyn a new job. When Llewyn is not willing to make a few changes to make him commercially viable, Bud offers him some reasonable advice.Llewyn hitches a ride back to New York. Along the way, he faces further choices, such as whether to meet his two year old son in Akron whom he just found out about in the last week.Llewyn decides to rejoin the Merchant Marine since he's broke and everyone hates him. Even this involves difficulties: past union dues, proper licensing, and meeting his ailing father once more.Will Llewyn get to a stable place in his life? Watch the final scene.-----Scores------Cinematography: 10/10 Just wonderful. The choices in lighting and camera work show strongly the sheer cold in New York, on the road from New York to Chicago, and in Llewyn's life.Sound: 10/10 Lush, beautiful. Kudos to Oscar Isaac and Justin Timberlake.Acting: 10/10 Kudos to Oscar Isaac. Excellent work by John Goodman, F. Murray Abraham, Garrett Hedland.Screenplay: 10/10 The character studies are brilliant, plus the exposition of the protagonist's difficult passage is carefully done.",10,1,6,3 January 2014
Spectre," Clearly the best Bond film ever.
","Why do I call this the best Bond film ever? Because it narrates a clear and conclusive path to the long overdue end to this excellent series. Take the opportunity. This film explains the entire series and shows Bond accepting a change in life path. There is no need for continuance after this wonderful film.The Three Acts:The initial tableaux: The film starts in Mexico City in a grand public Day of the Dead celebration. Bond seems to be enjoying himself, but soon is in direct pursuit of an enemy. When he returns to London, M lets him know that his actions were not appreciated, that he will be under observation, and that the double oh section is in danger of being shut down.Delineation of conflicts: C (head of the new organization Centre of National Security) wants to shut down the double oh section; M wants to keep it open. Bond wants to honor the postmortem wishes of the previous M. SPECTRE wants strong control of almost all information flow in the world, so as to have more power and to make more money. C wants that flow to be available to UK intelligence to replace older methodology, like MI6. Q, M, Tanner, Moneypenny, and Bond would like to preserve each other as well as some traditional British approaches to civilization and intelligence. C and SPECTRE are clearly opposed, and seem to have the upper hand during most of the film. Bond's foster brother wants to make Bond fully aware of how much he hates him.Resolution: Bond has an opportunity to be his better self; does he take it?",10,2,6,2 October 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Technically excellent action film saddled with a bloated script.
","Sam from the first two Transformer films has a new girl friend, Carly, whose ex-boyfriend, Dylan, helps him get a job. Little does Sam know that Dylan was the reason did not get any other jobs. He's cut off from contact with the autobots.An autobot artifact is found in Chernobyl. It is traced back to the dark side of the moon.This turns out to be a plant by the decepticons in a long gambit to get Optimus Prime to return and revive Sentinel Prime. The decepticons had already taken possession of hundreds of 'pillars' needed to construct a space-time bridge to Cybertron, which could allow for the whole transformer balance to be redone more strongly in favour of the decepticons.The decepticons show their hand when Sentinel announces he had 'made a deal with Megatron' at the end of the transformer war that destroyed Cybertron. Sentinel convinces the American government to help rebuild Cybertron, and to make the autobots exiles and outlaws. Director Mearing finally accepts Sam and plots to oppose Sentinel and the decepticons.The autobots get launched toward space; Megatron shoots them down. Sentinel plans to bring Cybertron to Earth in pieces via the space bridge, then to use six billion humans to rebuild it, as commanded, to its former glory.Sam finds where Carly is in Chicago. He re-unites with the autobots; they decide to attack the decepticon base in Chicago before the decepticons can fully enclose it and render it unassailable.There's a lot of fighting (45 minutes worth?).Will the decepticons be defeated before they pull Cybertron across the space bridge? ------Scores-------Cinematography: 10/10 Beautifully done eye candy.Sound: 10/10 Fine.Acting: 7/10 I liked John Turturro, Frances McDormand, John Malkowicz, Alan Tudyk, and Patrick Dempsey. Shia LeBoef and Josh DuHamel were OK, but Rosie Huntington-Whitely was a strong negative. Megan Fox is looking a lot better after seeing this film. The voice acting was very spotty; some fine (Leonard Nimoy comes to mind), some hard to understand, some just laughable.Screenplay: 6/10 Too long. Just under two hours would have been better, instead of just over two and a half. The story of Sentinel's betrayal was rather nice, but should have been tightened up. The story of the sky scraper broken in two was visually interesting, but the likelihood of humans surviving it seems very low.SFX: 10/10 Excellent.",8,3,4,14 December 2013
