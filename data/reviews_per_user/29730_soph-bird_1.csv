Skyfall," AMAZING! a must see!!
","I had very high expectations of this film, Skyfall, although I still had doubts about it as I didn't enjoy the last two films that much. However I must say it exceeded my still high expectations!! I really did enjoy the film and I am thinking of watching it for a second time, which I do not usually do with a Fillm, unless it is really good just like Skyfall wasSkyfall was everything you want in a bond film, therefore was a modern film but still keeping the main themes at heart in the way that it was exhilarating, had fights, funny 1 liners, cars and obviously women! I also liked all of the soundtracks in the film, they were very original which is always nice to see in a film. There were also some very good stunts during the film. Some of the stunts were so good they left my heart in my mouth! This film really is worth watching, it has a fascinating plot, and is also very gripping. If I could sum it up in one word it would be AMAZING!",10,5,19,28 October 2012
