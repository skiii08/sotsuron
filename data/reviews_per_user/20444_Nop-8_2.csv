Alien 3," Abominable - a shame to the series
","This one is really horrible. It messes up everything that made Alien and Aliens great movies. The transition from the end of Aliens to the beginning of this crap makes no sense at all. The survivors of Aliens are simply killing off, probably for no better reason than that the script simply doesn't fit into the Alien series at all. A military ship jettisoning its crew after a tiny fire (don't they build warships to stand a little damage anymore?). An 'escape pod' crashes headlong into a planet with not even an attempt at steering or breaking (wasn't there something called 'landing')?. And all of a sudden two Aliens pop up out of nowhere. The nice high-tech environments and cool hardware are exchanged for a prison that more reminds of sewers than anything else. And from there it's just a boring matter of watching the Alien doggy eat all of those feeble, uninteresting characters (good that suddenly humans can outrun the doggy). I have seen this one once and being a fan of Aliens, I regret it. If you liked Alien and Aliens, do yourself a favor and stay away!",1,685,833,24 January 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," What a heap of trash
","Looking at the previous, enthusiastic comments, I wonder whether I have actually seen the same movie. Dead mens chest doesn't even feel like a movie but rather like a sequence of unrelated short episodes crudely forced together. I'd say that the plot holes were large enough to sail the whole of the Spanish Armada through if the movie even made any attempt to explain the nonsensical hops from one part to the other. Thinking about it, nothing in the plot makes any particular sense.While the first movie had at least some of the swashbuckling adventure air you'd expect from a pirate flick, I found it lacking from the static and mostly dark settings of this one, felt more like a bad horror movie afloat on a studio pool. The special effects are professionally done, but as usual these days they are way overdone. I still wonder why the flying dutchman, originally a legendary ghost, had to look like Cuthullu with a hat. As for laughs and entertainment, I simply fell asleep about one hour into the movie.I recommend that anybody who likes classic pirate movies or has any knowledge about what a real ship sails like should not make himself suffer through this one.",1,9,15,6 October 2006
