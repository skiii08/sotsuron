Requiem for a Dream," The saddest drug-drama ever.
","Requiem For A Dream is probably the best drama I've seen. It's just so realistic and sad that you can almost feel the pain of those people in it. After you have seen this movie, you will be able to know how hard it is to live life with drugs.. And the theme, so fine & sad symphony.",10,0,0,14 March 2003
