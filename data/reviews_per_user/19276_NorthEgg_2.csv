The Ring," Watching a Tool video will give you the same amount of creeps and won't waste as much of your day.
","I really wanted to like this movie. That specific desire coupled with the nice camera work were the only things that got me through this 'nightmare' of a film. The cinematography is really impressive; evoking Kubrick (mostly from The Shining)and at times even Spielberg (specifically from Poltergeist). The director has definitely done his visual homework. The film itself evoked my previously-eaten taco to become uncomfortable in my tummy and work its way up my throat. I'll let you read about the plot holes (more like plot abysses)from other reviewers as I am not interested in wasting much more of my time with anything associated with this flop of a film. As a horror fan, this film will not be worth your time. Watching a Tool video will give you the same amount of creeps and won't waste as much of your day.",2,1,2,29 April 2003
8 Mile," My expectations weren't high so I wasn't disappointed
","The movie wasn't awful, but it wasn't great, either. I knew that going in, so I wasn't too disappointed when there were no Oscar-worthy performances. Eminem did well for what he was doing... playing Eminem. My husband liked the movie a lot more than I did but he liked Eminem to begin with so it's different. I just have a problem with Brittany Murphy's role in the movie. She had zero character development, except that she was a slut (ooh, what a surprise! I'm not talking about the actress. I love Brittany Murphy.) She was basically in the movie for one long disgusting sex scene which I fast-forwarded through and then some vague lines about 'I have a feeling about you.' She could have been left out completely and nothing would have changed except that the perverts would miss out on their bordering on porn sex scene.I'd be more impressed if Eminem played someone other than a trailer-trash white rapper from Detroit.",3,1,2,30 April 2003
