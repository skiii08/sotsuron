The Rock," Two Words: Very Bad
","Nothing but formulaic drivel.  There is only one surprise in this whole movie, and that involves a missile and a stadium.  Everything else is unbelievable and unbelievably stupid.  I fear for our nation's safety if our best soldiers (the Navy SEALs) are the idiots we see here.  I fear for the future of entertainment if so many people consider this a good movie.  Avoid it like a Michael Jackson concert.",4,7,14,8 July 2002
The Ring," This is how you make a horror movie!
","There's nothing scary about vampires. Or werewolves. (I've never seen one, so why be scared?) There's nothing scary about blood and gore. (I've seen plenty, so why be scared?) What's scary is the situation--when your TV turns itself on and you see something that makes you wet your pants. That's scary.And that's 'The Ring'. You could call 'The Ring' a ghost story, and that would be fair, but instead of starting out showing us the ghost, the movie builds up suspense by first showing us what the ghost is capable of, then why the ghost is so angry. After we understand this, then and only then do we see the ghost. This creates an understanding in our mind of what this thing is going to do. So when we see it, we scare ourselves.You see, the scariest stories involve the mundane (like televisions and video tapes). They take the things we see everyday and ask, 'What if...' This bypasses our rationality because we accept the plausibility of the scenario. And when a person can't think rationally, it doesn't take much to terrify them.Psychology 101. It'd be nice if more filmmakers would take a refresher course.",10,1,1,25 October 2004
Minority Report," Easy to Forgive the Flaws
","At the beginning of Minority Report, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) and his SWAT team converge on the house of a soon-to-be murderer.  They run into a problem when they discover that all the houses look alike.  Thanks to some clever observation, however, the day is saved, and the streets of a future Washington D.C. are safe once again.Such is the world and the cleverness of Minority Report.  The year is 2054, and the city's 'pre-crime' initiative, on the brink of becoming a nation-wide program, has successfully thwarted every murder attempt for the past six years.  The system works by having detectives analyze precognitive images that have been extracted from the minds of psychic people (called precogs).  When the precogs predict a murder committed by Anderton, the detective sets out on a journey to find the information, the minority report, that could prove his innocence.  His former teammates, led by a skeptical representative of the Attorney General, set out on a journey to capture him.Minority Report is visually dazzling, mentally engaging, and emotionally interesting without ever being manipulative.  Action scenes are suspenseful and smart, never resorting to cliche.  And in the hands of a brilliant director (Steven Spielberg) and a gifted actor (Cruise), this screenplay (based on a short story by Philip K. Dick) never lets up.Unfortunately, it does occasionally let down.  Take the opening scene, for example.  The detectives have the name of the perpetrator who is about to commit the murder in his own house.  Yes, the deduction method used to determine the house is clever, but do they not have this man's address? Could they not just look at the number on the door?Such moments of 'hey, wait a minute' distractions are few, but that makes them all the more annoying.  Minority Report is a very smart film, making the less intelligent segments that much more noticeable.Another example would be the fact that after John Anderton is pegged as a murderer-to-be and flees for his life, this highly secure government facility doesn't even bother to lock down his access, allowing him the opportunity to kidnap one of the precogs in an effort to clear his name. One would think heads would roll for this oversight, but that would require the ability to believe it in the first place.There's also the matter of technology that seems too advanced for fifty years hence, but that's a smaller matter since technology's advancements are not always linear or predictable.  And unlike most other sci-fi thrillers, the technology sets up some cool stunts but otherwise plays no part in the plot.  This is not a special effects movie; the plot would be as enjoyable with a budget of $50,000.  That's because, for all its idiosyncrasies, Minority Report never forgets about its characters.  John Anderton's tortured past is more than just a plot device; it's an integral part of the story, as are the histories of other major players.You will need to be somewhat forgiving as you watch the film, but given its cleverness and its overall fun, only the most curmudgeon moviegoer could refuse to let the minor points slide.***1/2, 9/10, A-",9,0,0,1 July 2002
Unbreakable," This movie is haunted by the ghost of Shyamalan's past.
","There is something inherently difficult in making a movie after striking gold in 'The Sixth Sense,' and 'Unbreakable' is haunted by the legacy of it's predecessor.   Part of the problem is that this movie just isn't as good as Shyamalan's first film.  (And lest you think the comparison is unfair, be aware that similarities to 'The Sixth Sense' abound in 'Unbreakable'--it's even set in the same city!)  Another problem is that Shyamalan's knack for dramatic realism is undermined by the fact that this is basically a Superman movie.   But the real problem is that, after including a whopper of an ending in 'Sixth Sense,' we, the viewers can't help but try to figure out what the surprise ending will be.  (We know there will be one, because  everyone expects it and will be disappointed if there isn't one.)  That instinct is very distracting, making it hard to feel for the characters because we're trying to decide what lies beneath the plot.   And the absolute worst part of the film is that the payoff for all our conjecture is simply not worth it.  Yes, it is surprising, but it is not a chilling, jaw-dropping revelation that completely changes the movie.  At best, you may find yourself saying, 'Wow, I didn't that coming!'  At the end of 'The Sixth Sense,' I saw many movie-goers who were absolutely speechless. The ones that could talk were trying to figure out how they'd missed it. 'Unbreakable' elicited none of these reactions when I saw it.  My suggestion for Shyamalan is to make a completely different movie (different style, feel, maybe even genre) next time to suppress the inevitable comparisons and try to regain the creative freedom he exercised so well in his first film.",6,0,0,10 January 2001
Fight Club," All the Right Ingredients, but Recipe Is Lacking
","Fight Club starts out as a cinematic lava lamp--the kind of thing that's most entertaining when you perception of reality is impaired.  The second half is more in-line with stylized Hollywood outings.  Unfortunately, the two halves aren't very compatible, and it's likely you'll end up wishing it favored one over the other.We start out following a man (Edward Norton) as he bounces between support groups for problems he doesn't have in an attempt to release his pent-up hostility and pain.  He eventually meets a woman with the same idea, and the two agree to evenly divide the support groups between them.  She turns out to be in dire need of help, just not the kind she can get from a roomful of testicular cancer survivors.  Norton, however, wants nothing to do with her.Then Norton meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a bizarre cross between a rock star and a pimp, whose line of traveling soap salesman seems oddly reminiscent of John Candy's character in 'Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.' When Norton's apartment mysteriously explodes, he borrows a page from 'Midnight Cowboy' and shacks up with Tyler.  But Tyler has powerful ideas and a powerful personality.  It isn't long before Norton's life gets intense.  When Tyler isn't sleeping with Marla, he's running an underground boxing club or devising ways to free his brethren from corporate America. His following grows thanks to his uncanny ability to convince the average man that blind devotion offers the greatest reward.  All this leads to a confrontation that's equally derivative and deceptive.The problem is, Fight Club doesn't merely lead us to believe things that aren't true; it deliberately lies to us.  Successful movies in this genre coerce us into filling in the blanks with our minds only to discover there were no blanks to fill in to begin with.  Fight Club, on the other hand, shows us one thing, then tells us something else, leaving us with more questions than answers (plot questions, not philosophical ones).  That's unfair and disappointing.  It's the sign of a movie that would have been great if the direction had been more cohesive.  Instead, we're left with 'just another wacky Brad Pitt movie.'",6,1,4,5 January 2003
12 Monkeys," Too Much Information
","'12 Monkeys' could have been great.  It has great actors giving great performances.  It has great direction of a great story.  It's dark, disturbing, and mystifying.  It's everything you could want out of science fiction.  But the whole thing falls apart because we know too much.  There's no suspense . . . unless you create some for yourself by thinking the ending will be any different than it has to be.Am I spoiling anything with that last comment?  No!  Because the movie spoils it all very early on.  We are shown flashes of events that will happen in the future--we see these several times, lest we forget.  But we are constantly reminded that the past can't be changed.  SO WHAT'S THE POINT?  We know what will happen, and we know nothing can change it.  All we're left with is watching things fall into place.  That could be entertaining if it were a secondary part of the plot, but it's not.  It's the whole story.  It's like being given a self-working, two-piece jigsaw puzzle.  There's no thought involved in it at all, no matter how much people may like to claim it is intellectually challenging.My grade: D, for 'disappointing'  Fun to watch for a feel what what good science fiction can be.  Just don't expect much in the way of suspense. There isn't any.",6,2,6,6 January 2003
The Others," One of the Scariest Movies I've Ever Seen
","Perfectly directed, well written and well acted, 'The Others' is an old-fashioned horror movie in the best sense.  Clean and simple (it could almost be rated 'G' if it weren't so scary), we don't get ambushed by special effects and excessive makeup.  No, 'The Others' plays with our heads, and it pays off beautifully.In a movie Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of, eerieness abounds, and we are left constantly wondering just what is up with this house. Photographs of dead men, women, and children tucked away in an album.  Loud noises in empty rooms.  A young girl strangely calm about all the supernatural events she claims to have witnessed.  Servants with something to hide.  And a heroine on the brink of madness.If you like scary movies, this is a must-see.  My fourteen-year-old son was giddy with fright, sometimes even tempted to look away from the screen, but always drawn back to make sure he didn't miss a moment.  Me, I never looked away--this movie is far too much fun.",9,0,0,21 August 2001
Chicken Run," Good, but more for children than adults
","I love Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit shorts, so I couldn't wait to see Chicken Run.  Unfortunately, animated movies are considered kids' fare, so Chicken Run is forced to focus on the kids more than the adults (although one has to wonder why a comment about 'over-sexed' Americans made its way into the script), as opposed to the sly silliness and unpredictability of Park's W&G stories.  That's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie, but it seems like Park betrayed his fans to make a successful 'family film.'Strangely enough, some moments--some KEY moments--seem destined to fly over kids' heads.  For example, when the revelation is made about Rocky's flying ability, what has been obvious to most viewers for some time is finally made know to the rest.  But the explanation consists of a brief glimpse at a poster and a semi-scientific quip about thrust.  So if we're going to get a vague explanation for such an obvious secret, why make it a secret at all? If this is meant to build suspense, it should not have been so predictable. (It works in that it makes kids feel smart when they can say they figured it out before they were told, but that just demonstrates how adults are ignored in this movie.)Overall though, the movie has enough humor and just plain fun to make it enjoyable.  I just hope that this does not mark the end of Nick Park's 'adult-friendly' fare.  He has too much satirical humor inside him to limit himself to the 12 and under crowd.",8,0,0,5 March 2001
MASH," I couldn't hate this movie more.
","ANYONE WHO LIKES THE TV SERIES SHOULD AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!   After falling in love with the TV show, I thought I'd see what spawned it.  I wish I hadn't.  This horrible movie (1/10 only because I could not give a 0) has forever put a shadow on my view of the TV show.  This movie is bad beyond words.  In the show, the lead characters, Hawkeye and Trapper, are nice, friendly guys who have developed a morbid sense of humor to keep from going insane.  In the movie, these two characters are just plain mean. They take an instant disliking to Frank Burns just because he's religious. Then they do everything they can to get him kicked out of the army (this happens early on, so this isn't a spoiler).  And the worst part of it is, Frank Burns is probably the nicest, most likeable character in the movie.How such a piece of trash could inspire one of the greatest TV series of all time is beyond me.  And now that question will be stuck in my mind for the rest of my life whenever I watch the show.",1,38,77,18 January 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Excellent on Every Level
","Ten years ago, an innocent young woman named Sarah Connor was targeted for assassination by a killing machine from the future.  She barely managed to escape with her life from that ordeal, but it ended up having a tremendous impact on her.  You see, a man had also been sent back from the future to protect her, and in the process he gave Sarah a warning about the terrible danger that threatened humanity--a nuclear war caused by a future computer that left humanity all but extinct.  Sarah's future son, John, was humanity's only hope in that future, but Sarah could stop the whole thing now if she tried.And try she did.  She became a killing machine herself, destroying the research that would lead to artificial intelligence.  But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't seem to find the root cause of the danger, so she began teaching her young son how to be a 'great military leader.'  Then finally, she was captured and institutionalized, leaving a rebellious John in foster care.This is where Terminator 2 begins.  And once again, the future artificial intelligence known as Skynet has sent a killing machine back in time to prevent John Connor from rising to lead the humans.  This time, though, ten-year-old John is the target.  And once again, the humans manage to send a protector back in time, as well.  It's only a matter of which one will get there first.Of course, the protector does, but just barely.  And off we go on a journey that will change the course of humanity and, more importantly, will redeem Sarah Connor.  For that is truly what the movie is about.  Sarah, tormented by the knowledge of a horrendous future, has completely lost touch with her humanity.  She is no longer capable of loving her son; her only concern is that he remain safe so he can lead the survivors in the future.  Then, when Sarah gets specific information regarding the development of Skynet, she heads off on a mission to ensure that future never happens.  Only John can stop her, but can this boy and his pet killing-machine convince her that murder will only hurt their cause?Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a story of life and hope and possibility. 'There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.'  And no matter how far down the road we've traveled, it's never too late to change direction.T2 is, in my opinion, James Cameron's masterpiece.  It works on every level, from superficial action to allegory.  The visuals are brilliantly devised, from the evil terminator driving a police car with the slogan 'to protect and to serve' to the fire extinguisher behind Sarah's supervising doctor in the interview scene.  It is one of my favorite movies, and, I would say with only the slightest hesitation, possibly one of the greatest movies of all time.",10,1,1,18 March 2003
The Patriot," This Is NOT about the American Revolution!
","This is fiction people!  And for the most part it's good fiction.  Yes, it does feel as long as it is (unlike 'Braveheart', whose pace made it feel a bit shorter).  And yes, there are some cliches, but the vast majority of 'The Patriot' is highly entertaining.All those whining about historical inaccuracies should realize that this movie is not about the American Revolution.  I mean, think about it: Do we hear the shot heard 'round the world?  Does anyone ever say, 'Don't shoot till you see the whites of their eyes'?  Where's Paul Revere?  No minutemen. 'One if by land; two if by sea'?'The Patriot' is about a man seeking revenge and redemption.  The memories of the atrocities he committed in wartime haunt him as much as the memory of his dead son.  His country happens to be at war, and that is where he directs his rage.  The story would be exactly the same if it had happened during the Civil War or the War of 1812 because the movie is about the man and his mission.  You can't say the same thing about 'Braveheart' or 'Saving Private Ryan' because those movies were about specific people and/or specific wars.  'The Patriot' is about humanity, and it happens to be set during a war.  So enjoy it, and stop worrying about what type of canon balls they should have used.",8,1,3,5 July 2001
Pearl Harbor," Every American Should Be Insulted
","Let me get the good stuff out of the way first (since it will take the least amount of time).  The second act of 'Pearl Harbor', in which the Japanese attack the Naval base, contains some of the most visually stunning and heart-breaking moments ever produced in a war film.There is nothing else good about this movie.  That's not to say it's all bad, although a lot of it is--some of it actually rises to mediocrity.  But as an American, indeed as a human, I can't stand to think that the suffering and bravery of those lost in one of the most cowardly acts of war ever committed has been reduced to filler in a COMPLETELY predictable, sub-soap-opera love story.From the opening moments of the film, we are introduced to the poor writing and bad acting that permeates the film as two young boys realize that violence strengthens friendship.  They grow up, join the military, fall in love with the same woman, fight each other, fight the Japanese, hate each other, and then move into a final third act that any ten-year-old could predict.Meanwhile, this cartoon actually seems to believe it's being patriotic, that it is somehow paying tribute to those whom it claims to be about.  But this movie is just too stupid.  Think of it as an after-school special about WWII.  It's cheesy, it's uninspired, and it's insulting.  To think that after such excellent fictional war movies as 'Platoon' and 'Saving Private Ryan' one of the most pivotal moments in American history ends up being made as a teen flick . . .Now there's a tragedy.",3,4,6,27 December 2001
Hero," Possibly the Year's Best Movie
","About halfway through the film, as Broken Sword considers the betrayal he just experienced, I was engulfed by the feeling of 'this is why you go to a movie.''Hero' is beautiful, heartbreaking, thrilling and thoughtful. The screen is constantly full of breath-taking images and perfectly balanced throughout. If you're going to watch a full-screen version of this, don't waste your time. The composition of each shot is so perfect that any hack job will only make you wonder what everyone is so hyped up about.And the story--wow! I expected a straight-forward action movie, but 'Hero' has more twists than all of M. Night Shyamalan's films combined. Is Jet Li's nameless character a hero, or does he have a secret agenda? Is the emperor a caring leader or a maniacal dictator? Just when you think you know the answer, another twist unfolds.Some may dismiss this movie with words like 'propaganda,' but don't be fooled. No character in this movie makes a choice lightly. The cost of every decision is weighed heavily, and Nameless recognizes that his ultimate decision will lead to less than perfect results. Still, the ideal is there, and it is an ideal that transcends time and culture. The ultimate moral of the story is hardly a call to arms but a reminder that war doesn't lead to peace; peace comes from a vision in which war has no part. That's not propaganda. That's a message of hope in an imperfect world.",10,4,7,18 September 2004
Back to the Future Part III," Time Travel Isn't Fun Anymore
","Trapped in 1955, Marty discovers the time machine left for him by Doc in 1885.  Doc's instructions are clear: return to 1985 immediately, and destroy the time machine.  But when Marty discovers that Doc met (will meet?) an untimely end in 1885, he decides instead to travel back in time to save him. Unfortunately, as soon as he arrives in the old west, the DeLorean is taken out of commission, leaving both of them stranded in the past.  As they devise a way to get the car up to 88 MPH, Marty end up picking a fight with Biff's ancestor, and Doc falls in love.The plot works well, and part 3 is every bit as good a movie as the original (I thought the second was wholly lacking in the plot department until the final act), but this installment is decidedly less fun.  In fact, it would be difficult to categorize this in the action-comedy style of the first two. Part of the reason is that there are fewer jokes this time around, but even the jokes we do get are overshadowed by the darkness of the plot.The first movie was a fun romp in the past as Marty discovered that his parents actually were typical teenagers in their day.  Yes, we had the death of Doc Brown, but when that happened at the beginning, we didn't have an emotional investment in him, and as the movie went on, we got the feeling that some way, somehow, things would turn out okay in the end.The second movie had a very dark middle portion, but the movie didn't remain there long enough for it to cast a shadow over the rest of the film.  The final act returned us to the giddy frivolity of the original, leaving us smiling through the last forty-five minutes.Part 3 starts with the impending death of a character we have come to love. Some characters (namely, Marty's ancestors) serve only to remind us that the future is at stake, and Doc's love interest simply makes the emotional investment that much heavier.  In fact, at the end of the movie, when Clara unknowingly places herself in grave danger, we find it impossible to cheer her strong devotion because her actions may end up costing Doc his life! And this time around we don't have idiotic Biff (Buford is mean but not stupid) to lighten up the tone.As I wrote earlier, this is not a bad film, and I don't want to give the impression that I don't like it because I do.  But I'm glad they ended the series when they did, because this final installment clearly demonstrates that the fun was gone.B-",7,0,0,21 January 2003
Blood Diamond," Blood Brothers
","What does it take to turn someone into a killer? The answer is different for each character involved in this movie. For some it is survival. For others it is the hope of escape from a life of hell. For some it is family. For others it is greed. Caught in the middle of it all are the children who have such little desire to kill for any reason that they must be brainwashed into becoming the instruments of their masters who claim to offer freedom.Every few years an action movie comes along that has amazing depth. Terminator 2 and The Matrix are such movies, and so is Blood Diamond. It is full of characterizations we've seen before, but it's the interaction that raises this film above the masses. Each character has an agenda that forces him or her to distrust everyone else. The paths that some relationships take to develop trust are believable, while others are equally believable in remaining eternally antagonistic. And through it all is the realization that while some characters may change their methodology and morals, none ever change their dreams. Each character fights for the goal to the bitter end. Such is human nature, and such is the conflict of Blood Diamond, the conflict of Africa. In the end, we are left to wonder if peace can ever be attained in such a world. And somehow we are left believing that maybe it can.",8,186,273,11 December 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," Funny and Fun! But Hilarious?
","This movie definitely has some funny moments.  I mean, how can you not laugh at elves dancing around an 18' Stonehenge during a heavy metal concert?  And David's 'What the--' reaction is priceless.  But hilarious?  Hysterical? No, I don't think so.  To say that is to take away from such laugh riots as 'The Naked Gun', 'TNG 33 1/3', and 'There's Something about Mary', all of which left my jaw aching from laughter.'This Is Spinal Tap' is thoroughly enjoyable, and the DVD has some terrific extras.  (I still can't figure out why they cut the scene with the disappointed fan at the autograph signing.)  Still, I have no plans to buy the DVD--or even watch the movie again.  It was fun once, but 'Spinal Tap' will almost certainly never rise above cult status.",8,0,1,3 July 2001
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Almost good
","I heard someone say Die Hard 'blew up the mold!'  True enough.  Die Hard 2 was so highly anticipated that the theaters actually started showing it a day or two (can't remember) early.  To me, that one lived up to its predecessor's legacy.  It maintained the claustrophobic feel while mixing up the formula.  (And that airplane crash scene gave me chills!)Die Hard with a Vengeance completely abandons the claustrophobia that made the DH films unique.  Instead of a hero with geographical limitations, we get a hero with chronological limitations.  (Most of his Herculean labors must be accomplished within a certain time frame or something bad will happen.)  So what's different about that?  At least half the thrillers of all time involve some sort of time limit.  So in abandoning its heritage, DH3 loses its identity.Despite that, DH3 almost succeeds in creating a new identity of its own.  In a rarity for action thrillers, we actually watch each heroic effort wondering if John McClane will succeed, as he doesn't succeed every time. However, the movie abruptly stops these challenges about halfway through, and the rest of the movie is just generic, stunt-filled cat-and-mouse fare.The other level on which this movie fails is in showing us bleak futures for characters we love.  The McClanes were having marital difficulty in the first movie, but they got back together, and John changed as a result of his experiences in that office building.  Now, John is virtually psychotic since his wife left him.  What happened?  For that alone I wish I hadn't seen this movie.  The last time I saw them they were happy if a bit cursed when Christmas rolled around.So, what's the score now?  Three severe blows to the head?  That's more than enough since the movie never actually recovers from the first one.  It's a shame, too.  All through this movie you can see the wasted potential.",5,0,0,22 January 2001
Back to the Future Part II," Sometimes Good, Often a Mess
","The first 'Back to the Future' was a whimsical fantasy adventure that managed to blend silliness, cleverness, action, and science-fiction into a delightful 'what-if' scenario.  'Part 2' picks up at the moment the original left off, with Marty and the Doc heading into the future to prevent a family disaster.  Once again, the movie attempts to blend silliness, cleverness, action, and science-fiction, but this time the total is less than the sum of the parts.In the future, Marty tries to keep his son from getting arrested for robbery, which he does, but in the process his now aged nemesis Biff steals the DeLorean and changes the his future, which, of course, changes Marty's as well.  Marty and the Doc are unaware of Biff's actions until they return to the past--er, present--and discover a world they no longer know.  Their only choice is to go back in time and prevent Biff from changing history.When stated in the form of a paragraph, the plot seems basic and flowing, but the movie is anything but.  The film has all the necessary ingredients to create a worthy sequel to the original, but none of the pieces fit together.  All the scenes feel like one-act plays, none really relating to the other until the third act, which does manage to tie a couple of threads together, but even then, many of the early parts fell like so much filler.Gone is the wry humor of the original ('You are my density'), and the cleverness of the plot, the fun of exploring the possibilities of a time paradox.  What we get in return is a chance to watch the original movie from a different angle (literally)--a treat, to be sure--but that doesn't come until the third act.  At that point we're reminded of the fun of the original 'Future', something this sequel can't manage to recreate.In some ways, the sketchiness of the film makes sense.  The fact that 'Part 2' doesn't end (the plot is resolved, but not everyone is where they should be) and the hints to 'Part 3' littered throughout this installment indicate that the two films were meant to be a single story.  Together, I guess they do form a complete whole, but when compared to another 'bridge' sequel, 'Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back', even that excuse fails to satisfy.  I think what we really have is filmmakers with a deadline that forced them to cut short the rewriting phase.  Pity.7/10**1/2C",7,1,2,28 July 2002
Gladiator," 'Braveheart' it isn't.
","WARNING:  The last line may contain a possible spoiler.   The massive popularity of 'Gladiator' blows my mind.  Yes, it is an entertaining movie, but it is hardly the type of movie (historic, epic, depressingly dark) that usually appeals to most movie-goers.  In some ways, this movie reminded me more of bleak, cautionary Sci-Fi flicks like 'The Running Man' ('look at the darkness the human heart is capable of' type movies) rather than the heart-breaking human dramas recent epics like 'Braveheart' and 'Rob Roy' have been.   But I think the weakest part of the movie is the villain, Commodus.  He's too weak to carry the movie, and since the driving force of the movie is Maximus' desire to avenge what was done to him and his family, that is a fatal weakness.  Commodus' only skill is making sure his enemies are incapacitated in some way (or at least outnumbered) before they can get anywhere near him.  You see, he knows how pathetic he really is, so he doesn't allow himself to get into a position in which he is likely to get the living daylights beat out of him (which just about anyone in this movie could do to him).   Maybe it's just me.  Maybe I wanted an evil villain instead of one that just frustrated me so much.  Perhaps the thought of a ruler who doesn't deserve his power will be enough conflict for other viewers.  But Commodus' weaknesses seem so obvious, I just wanted to stand up and tell everyone to open their eyes.  'This is the man you let *lead* you?!'  But no one in this movie, except Maximus, can see Commodus for what he really is.  (Well, some could, but they wouldn't do anything about it, for some reason.)  So how can I feel any satisfaction seeing such a weak man finally get his due?",6,0,0,15 January 2001
