Blade Runner 2049," Long movie but not in a bad way....
","As a regular IMDB user I ended up making an account just to write this review - I just loved this movie.I went into this as a big sci-fi fan but not so much a fan of the original movie, however this continues the story extremely well (some might say more in depth/better) from the original. The main thing is you need to understand this movie is long, but not drawn out or boring which is what I got from the original - this kept me interested and captivated from start to finish. There was even times where I thought I knew where the story was going and it caught me by surprise again.If you enjoy a good sci-fi flick, this is a great film, you don't necessarily need to watch the original if you don't want to - it fills the gaps quite well, however if it's a rainy day outside and you want to get the full backstory - it couldn't hurt :-)",9,3,8,11 August 2018
