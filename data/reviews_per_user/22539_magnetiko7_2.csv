Conquest 1453," Another insult to the art of film-making
","This film has almost 8/10 rating and 66% of users gave it 10 stars but this doesn't make it a good film for several reasons. First of all, there is no character development and you cannot relate to any of the characters. Secondly, acting is horrible, even laughable at times. In addition, there are zillions of all sorts of goofs (mostly anachronisms and factual errors). Finally, an important historical event is unrealistically told while using too much propaganda which casts a shadow all throughout the film. A far better acting, a much bigger budget with superior visual effects, a way more realistic narration and a lot less propaganda could have created a great film. Now, why does this film have a high rating? It is hard for me to answer this without offending my fellow Turkish citizens. All in all, this film is an insult to the art of film-making and a hundred years of Turkish cinema. If you want to see a good Turkish film, you can try this year's Palme d'Or winner 'Winter Sleep' by Nuri Bilge Ceylan.",2,3,6,27 May 2014
Evil Dead," Neither terrifying nor terrible
","I'm a horror fan and I had been waiting for this film for some time trying to keep my expectations low (since the film was advertising itself as 'the most terrifying film you will ever experience' which actually meant 'it might be a good idea to check it out' to me.) So I watched the film with four friends at the cinema today and after the film I was the only one who didn't regret watching it. Although one of them said 'at least we did something different' but he was most probably referring to going to the cinema. The original film was one of the first horror films I saw as a kid and it really did terrify me then but this one was just a horror-flavoured blood bath (almost literally in some scenes) and kept me on the edge of my seat for quite a short time. Nevertheless it kept me watching and I didn't get bored. I don't think this film is underrated or overrated but generally speaking, even the best horror films are underrated. No horror film gets a 10 or even 9/10. All in all, I recommend this film only to horror fans.",8,5,18,21 April 2013
