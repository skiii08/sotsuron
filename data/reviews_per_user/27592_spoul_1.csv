Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome movie
","I thought the movie was excellent and very well done. It seems like too many fans and critics are nitpicking this movie instead of just sitting back and enjoying it. The first trilogy was trashed for having bad dialogue, weak characterizations, and slim plot. When did that all change? This movie is just continuing on the proud tradition. I enjoyed the story and the characters just as I enjoyed them in the original trilogy.It also seems as if many people, especially the critics, missed the whole point of the movie. I can't spoil the plot, but anyone who is a true fan will know what I mean.(It involves Senator Palpatine). This movie is also just setting up the story for the next two, which should get better. Also interesting was Lucas' anti-gambling stance and his statements about bureaucracy which deals with some of todays important issues. It may seem that I'm making this movie out to be deeper than it actually is, but I felt I had to point out some ideas that most people seemed to miss while they were being dazzled by the awesome effects.There is absolutely no way this movie can live up to it's hype, but I know there will still be many people to see it a few hundred times. I know I will. As for everyone else, sit back and watch the movie instead of finding any petty detail and ripping it apart. You may find you'll enjoy it a lot more.",10,0,1,25 May 1999
