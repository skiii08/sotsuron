It," Almost perfect horror film
","I know a movie can't be perfect but i was this close to giving IT a 10. The imagination of the scares was great. Bill Skarsgaard plays an incredibly menacing Pennywise. The scenes with the kids bonding told the story succinctly without a lot of film. I loved the pacing, that the writers kept much of King's source material.At no point did it feel cheesy, I was fully expecting it to be but was pleasantly surprised. The effects were incredible, little Georgie mutating at the end of the movie into Pennywise was effing fantastic.I'm sure on a second watch I'll change my mind, but at first glance this film is outstanding and a top contender for scariest movies this decade.",9,0,2,7 August 2018
A Star Is Born," A Star is Born Review
","I will preface this with stating that I have not seen any of the other iterations, but read wiki enough to understand - Man falls for rising star as his fades due to alcoholism, conflict ensues, he dies either by walking in the ocean or driving drunk, and the despondent rising star finds a last token of his love that gives her the strength to carry on.Now, given that synopsis, there are two things I would expect to see in the film; either his jealousy ruins their marriage and sends him into further decline, or their love lasts through it all but he can't kick the addiction and takes his life when he realizes how much he's hurt his wife.I think that where this version went wrong is that this version tried to do both, and ended up not doing either well; the love story was sloppy, and conflict was hinted at but never essential, and the story ended up being about the man and his addiction rather than the love story.Love story was sloppy: There was a scene where the two ride out to Arizona on a bike, no words, a flash to them kissing at a gas pump, Jack's feet in sand, and then he punches his brother in the face. What could've been a scene where the couple talk about his anger, her fear that he would overreact, etc, we just see her standing in the background as Jack and his brother yell at each other. I call the budding romance via music montage the 'twilight effect' because you never actually hear these people share there souls with one another. I also felt like we only saw things from Jack's perspective; a cut-over to a new scene, and Ally was at the next phase of her career. It had no meat, they were just head over heels and we were supposed to believe it.Conflict: When Ally goes on SNL and does her 'ass in them jeans' song, Jack's anger is shown when he calls her ugly later on, but we never see the compromise from Ally's perspective- again it's hinted at with the dance class and her saying 'it was supposed to be one song'. I would have wanted to see her making the decision to 'not say anything' and the early conflict with Jack about the new direction... instead we get reaction, repair, and then it's forgotten. There were also other ways they could have shown his light fading - paparazzi not wanting a candid of him, and only wanting Ally, him acting out and punching them - a quick 5 min of film and we could've seen his frustration.A story about an addict: At the end of the day, Lady Gaga is just a set piece in this story about an addict who can't stop despite having people who care for him and his physical reason for taking the pills being gone - that was the emotional anchor of the story - no matter how many times you scream at Jack to not take a drink or pop a pill. What we got was a rich backstory of a boy who had already tried suicide but whose alcoholic father didn't even notice, a boy who became a rock star whose brother gave up his dreams to keep him alive.Sadly Cooper didn't seem to agree that's what the story was about, and instead we got a movie that tried all the things and ended up not doing any of it well.",6,1,6,12 November 2018
Aquaman," Perfect Mix of Camp, Action, Plot & Style
","This movie wasn't on my radar, I was thoroughly disappointed by Justice League and had zero desire to see this. Yet as the reviews came in, and as Jason Momoa killed it on the PR trail, I finally decided to give it a go and really enjoyed it.Some standouts:
Jason Momoa is a star. He carried this script with all of it's tongue-in-cheek groan-worthy lines... I read somewhere that he uses Metal songs to get into character and that Tool was one of his inspirations. Personally I think Tool is a Very Serious Band and so is their front-man Maynard, but he has a pretty weird sense of humor.For some reason I kept paying attention to the physics - there are a lot of people flying through walls and getting hit really hard, you really feel the kinetic force of the action.The plot is predictable but epic, the final battle is outstanding, and the world design is colorful, interesting, and fun.DCEU really steps up the game with this entry into its universe, but I don't really see Wonder Woman, Super Man, or Batman as having the ability to carry a movie with this level of humor and color. They're going to need to introduce a new team in an alternate setting that can be comical, colorful, and have a ton of action - I think the Lantern Corps are going to be the best way even though it was attempted previously.",8,0,2,24 January 2019
Milk," Christian Conservative, Deeply Moved
","Going into this movie (watching it on Blu-Ray, rather) I had mixed expectations, ie what type of homosexual acts would I see on TV, what kind of propaganda would I hear, etc. I didn't expect to be as moved as I was, however. Yes there was guy on guy action, but it was tasteful, and didn't belittle the relationships the men had with one another by displaying the intimacy in a comically graphic light. The implied scenes were just enough to let you know what was going on, but the camera never lingered, and therefore the scenes were never uncomfortable.The movie itself made me realize how shallow and judgmental my perspective on homosexuality has been. Some Christians may think that it is a disease, a sickness that needs to be purged, but it can't be. These people identify themselves as homosexuals because of who they are on the inside much like blacks and Hispanics identify themselves based on their skin. You can't change that, and you shouldn't deny people their rights because of who they are. They are not criminals, they're human beings trying to live the freedoms that were promised to them.The way this country treated gays was unacceptable, and the way the church pushed Prop 6 was disgusting, and Milk helped me see the error of our ways. I do not think there is some huge gay agenda to snatch away our children, I think there's hope for the children who are confused about their feelings, and I see now the fight to make that a possibility.I laughed, I cried, I cringed a little bit when Penn and Franco kissed, but ultimately I finished this movie with a new perspective of gays, and of myself.9/10",9,3,7,26 April 2010
Cloverfield," Very enjoyable
","I thought the entire concept of the movie was very well done: A guy is going away so his friends decide to document his surprise party, and by accident they capture extraordinary events on film.The movie was very believable, meaning the characters respond to a catastrophic event in a very believable way.Through the taped over bits we can see that Rob is very much attached to Beth, which explains his guilt to shooing her away from the 'safe-zone' that was his complex.They begin a trek to safety only to walk right into the middle of everything happening. Through tragedy we see Rob's future sister in law loses the survivor instincts she had in the beginning, and decides to help Rob, who's also overcome with grief and regret, find Beth.The cameraman is there because he has to support his best bud.The special effects were incredible, you feel like you're on the front lines of this spic battle.The script bounces from digression to situational, which is realistic for a group of friends scared, tired, and overcome with grief.Overall the movie is very much Godzilla in its nature. But where Godzilla follows scientists trying to find answers, and being scripted to know everything about the creature, Cloverfield takes the approach of the collateral damage of a supernatural event; it follows characters who have no idea what the hell is going on, and don't want to know. They just want to find their friend and get the hell out of NYC.",8,3,7,6 April 2010
Oblivion," Another Day in Paradise
","I thought this movie was fresh until people reminded me of Moon. Oh well they're both good.Overall the movie was well played out and the narration does well to make sure we don't know too much before the big reveal. Some twists can be guessed, but the movie was well acted, and it's actually a great acting effort by Cruise... not as good as Reacher (which I feel came out at the same time) but decent.The design kind of looks ripped from Mass Effect or the Star Wars Prequels, but overall it was nicely done. Great shots of the desolate landscape in the spirit of Fallout 3.I feel that Freeman was underused and the team he leads were mindlessly erased from plot progression; they're so careful for years and end up as nameless body counts. Except for a few devices that felt like they were there to drive the plot the movie was OK. 7/10",7,0,0,24 February 2014
Justice League," As bad as I thought
","I'll start with the CGI- on my UHD 4K 1080p Set the CGI looked like a cartoon. Steppenwolf looked like a video game villain. Cyborg was the worst thing I've seen since Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern.The direction- the opening credits with life shots of normal people was a waste considering people are not really a concern in the movie. The Snyder slow mo effect was expected and tired. The script- I almost had to mute it. It was like a high school play. They each had terrible lines, but AM took the cake, with WW second... the whole 'she closed off herself' speech between her and BM was just unwatchable.The plot- I had no idea what the hell was going on, a box, mother? Unity? Darkseid? What was the big plan? Also BM in the comics wouldn't show up as Bruce Wayne to get a team together, he would do something awesome to wow the recruit. And the end credits with Luther making his own team??? How is that a bigger threat than an alien trying to wipe out the planet?I had really low expectations coming into this, but this movie surpassed them all. There was so much potential with the DCU but time and time again they screwed the pooch by trying to catch up to marvel's 10 years in less than 3.",5,0,1,6 August 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Emotional Ending to Epic Saga
","After ten years, we're finally through with the Infinity War Saga/Marvel's Great Experiment.To say I was emotional is an understatement, I laughed, I cried, and I cheered.There were major issues I had with the plot and major questions I had about the future, but that doesn't spoil the fact that I loved this movie.",9,0,3,6 May 2019
It Follows," Misled by 'scary' reviews & Thoughts on establishing rules
","I was thrown off by the time period in which the movie supposedly takes place. It was intentional per the director, but it was distracting. I think the movie needs to tell the viewer when the setting is somehow to let them know the 'rules'- for example a kid can't have a cell phone in a 90s movie, but it's expected for a movie in present day.There isn't a lot of dialogue, a vast majority of the 'sound' is a very 80s dreamlike synthesizer which adds to the dreamy direction of the movie. It's very prettily filmed, but there are a lot of slowly- turning shots which seem pointless. There are also a few times that the director started a sense of dread with a scene, then messes it up with his choices. Here's what I mean: there is a scene where Jay (the protagonist) is walking through a dark house, the camera follows behind her, closely, so you know something is coming, but you don't know where. Right before the reveal happens, the director switches the shot to film from the monster's perspective in the next room, so when Jay walks into the room and is surprised, we aren't. The movie's 'rules' for the monster are pretty rigid- it walks slowly in a straight line to its intended target, so by definition, you know that Jay isn't going to be surprised from behind, because it doesn't appear out of thin air. My point is, what could've been a good climax to a build up, ends up being secondhand.The final confrontation with the monster seems to bend the rules already established in the movie, so it falls flat. There are also two scenes in which two characters appear as if they are going to pass it on to random hosts, but nothing is shown (all other sexual encounters are) so it ends up again leading the viewer to question the established rules.Overall, I was extremely disappointed because I had read multiple accounts of this being the scariest movie in a decade, and I loved the concept, but the movie just isn't scary, and there are too many questions to make it a good piece of film. I'm not going to destroy it in the ratings because there is much worse (and the acting was actually good) but I feel like I'm below the average here, so I gave it a 6.",6,1,2,24 April 2017
A Quiet Place," Extremely well done, but not a 10
","You're definitely going to feel the burn. 
You definitely will not make a sound in the theater. 
You will appreciate our freedom to be loud AF.
The movie does a great job with all, and the acting/directing by John K was top-of-the-line. However, as with any other-worldly movies, you start to wonder the rules of the world, and you see some details that the director caught, but catch the details that seemed obvious and got left out. For example: 
The creatures can hear small sounds from far away, so the family has to whisper and walk on beach sand everywhere.... but
Near a waterfall they can speak... and
The creatures can't hear them because something nearby is louder... 
With that logic... why can they hear a whisper from hundreds of yards away when there are thousands of bits of noise between them and the noisemaker, yet they can't hear a heartbeat from a terrified human? 
Inevitably in these kinds of movies we always get the 'we never tried that' mechanic to kill the creatures, which sure enough they do. I know it's hard to wrap up these kinds of movies, but why does it have to? I would have loved if Emily Blunt and the kids united together against all odds to continue living even though John K dies... that kind of ending would have made me give a 9.5. TL;DR - great acting, great concept, funky rules, predicatable ending",8,1,2,16 April 2018
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Meh
","I have not read the books, and am just basing this off of the acting and dialogue present in the story.First, let me just that I felt as if the only player acting with any conviction was Lautner. His character was believably obsessed w/ Stewart's character, and you could feel the angst in his dialogue, regardless of how poor it was.Greene was also a scene stealer, though her scenes were few and far between.I gave this a 5/10 based off of Stewart's and Pattinson's performances. We are supposed to believe that these star-crossed lovers are deeply devoted to one another and insanely in love, but there was no chemistry, and no emotion in either of them.The movie also tries to parallel Twilight to Romeo and Juliet in the first 20 minutes of the film... If you have to parallel your story to a famous romance to convey the relationship your two protagonists have with one another, you have failed as a writer.Stewart acts like she's distracted or that she's too good for the Twilight crowd. The detachment that she feels halfway through the movie seems real, but she acts like that while she's with Pattinson. If she thinks this gig is just a means to a career, she has another thing coming, and she better fine tune her acting- I'll assume based on what I saw that her Joan Jett biopic will be a disaster.Pattison is like a dolled up zombie for the entire movie, and his 'you are my everything' lines scream 'we don't know how to write love'. He speaks with no conviction or passion, yet that's everything his character is supposed to represent... he also has a funny looking left nipple (see the scene where he rips off his shirt).Actually my biggest pet peeve of both movies is the musical transition for the budding relationship. We're supposed to believe these people are falling in love, but have nothing but a music video to base anything off of.Maybe the movie fails because of the actors, maybe it's the writers' faults, maybe it's both, but unless you're the obsessed fangirl that saw this movie in week one, the only character remotely relatable is Jacob, due to a fairly mature performance by Lautner.I went in expecting mediocrity and that's what I got. My girlfriend is making me read the books before the next one, so maybe I'll have a different perspective this time next year.",5,5,8,7 December 2009
Pulp Fiction," An Elvis Man should love it
","How do you review your all-time favorite movie objectively? This movie is my Citizen Kane, and for a time in my life changed how I viewed movies (now that I'm older I'm a little easier to entertain). Not only is every scene quotable (I knew every line at one point) but the images are forever a part of our canon. The way the story unfolds is like an Aesop Fable, the characters each representing part of ourselves. Are we able to realize a miracle when we see one in the age of cynicism like Jules? Can we walk away from a bad scene, can what be seen be unseen?Or are we ignorant, living our lives matter of factly like Vincent? Will we be able to wash our hands of our mistakes or will we just get something else dirty? Will life literally catch us with our pants down?Maybe we are in a bad situation like Butch, and someone else has control over our lives. We could burn bridges from these people, or we could, with honor, save them from being screwed over (so to speak).Are we thieves trying to stick it to the man like Honey Boney and Ringo? Are we struggling with addiction and dwelling on the past like Mia? Or are we even like Marcellus, losing grasp on the things we once held firm?This movie is a masterpiece, but some people can't look past the grittiness of the story to truly appreciate it.10/10",10,0,2,6 December 2013
Wedding Crashers," Funny Every Viewing
","My wife bought me the Blu-Ray for Christmas, and I swear I laughed at every line still.There are just so many quotable lines that found their way into my lexicon as a college student, and years after. It's funny now to watch it and realize, holy crap, that's where that came from.The plot is absurd to say the least, having gone through a wedding myself, I know that at least the bride or groom should know everyone there, or at least recognize them... idk maybe there were just so many wedding guests that they didn't know them all, but it's still asking a lot from the viewer, specifically latching onto a member of the Cleary's grooms family. But plot absurdity is what makes the movie so hilarious. I'm not sure how fresh the concept was when the movie was released originally, but Vaughn and Wilson strike gold and the script is phenomenal. I won't show this to my kids immediately upon their 13th birthday, but there will be a time when I can bust this out and show them how funny movies were back in my day.9/10",9,0,1,14 January 2014
Joker," Shouldn't have been a Batman Movie
","This movie did not have to be associated with Batman, yet they forced in the Wayne family even as far as to have a clown mask-wearing henchmen be the catalyst for Batman's origin. It felt like the writer had no idea where to take the film after Arthur shoots Murray.This could have been a great story about a depressed person whom the system fails that cracks and commits a series of atrocities. But the fact that I was supposed to believe this guy is Batman's arch-nemesis the whole movie left me wanting. At no point did I believe this guy could inspire others to violence - his supposed attack on the elite on the subway was a guy shooting in self-defense after getting his ass kicked. There's no way I would believe that would be the tipping point to spark the riots in the last half of the movie.And the Zazie Beetz 'reveal' that she and Arthur weren't really a thing- if you believed that the romance was not a hallucination of a sick man when we are CLEARLY watching the movie from his perspective, then shame on you... but the fact that Todd Phillips felt the need to show the romance was a fabrication was an insult to the audience.I was extremely bored in the film, didn't think it deserved the buzz it received, and it left me just feeling sad.",5,3,16,21 October 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," Kinda Melancholy But OK
","I didn't love the movie per se, but I appreciated what it was going for. It is very melodramatic, and it took some time to understand the Australian scenes, but the movie was gut-wrenching in some parts and Colin Farell does some of the best acting of his career.Emma Thompson plays a great lead in the film and really carried the movie... if Mary Popping was about Mr. Banks, then Saving Mr. Banks was about P.L. Travers' solemn past.Tom Hanks is on point as Walt Disney and the supporting cast does a great job of lightening the mood of a pretty dreary movie.There were a lot of old folks in the theatre, so I don't know that young teen would appreciate the movie as much, my own high-school aged in-laws were visibly restless. Would recommend seeing, but only if you're wide awake.7/10",7,0,1,2 January 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Midgardian Mind Getting Overwhelmed
","With the score of Marvel movies out now in essentially the same universe, the directors ask a lot from the viewers. Before seeing this my wife and I watched Thor 1, thinking it would catch us up, but we both forgot about The Avengers, and looked at each other confused when Loki was brought to Odin in handcuffs. We also both had to think about what the characters meant when they talked about a god taking over Selvig's mind... Basically, the movie gives you zero help in remembering why things are the way they are, so I'd recommend watching Thor and Avengers first before checking this out.I loved the way the movie looked and flowed, but there were a lot of 'well it's a movie' plot turns, and the plot itself seemed strait out of Start Trek: an alien race is dormant after being conquered and their power source taken away, the power source is found and awakens them, they seek to bring the universe to their status-quo. That being said, the art design was fantastic for the Dark Elves and for Asgard, kudos, and there were some seriously LOL moments that seem to be a trademark for Marvel to keep their movies out of the realism that DC is trying for.It was fun and enjoyable and again Marvels has a winner... but I would stress to the viewer, there is required viewing of at least the Avengers to know what the hell is going on.8 out of 10",8,0,3,15 November 2013
Unbroken," Unattached
","I really wanted to like this movie, but Angelina Jolie's storytelling caused me to lose the connection to the main character, Zam, once he and his friend Phil are separated. From hearing about the book, I know that Zam goes through years of substance abuse and revenge plotting against the Japanese people for what the torturers did to him, but I never felt that in the movie.I also never really understood why Zam was singled out by The Bird, and I never felt like he or any of the characters were in mortal danger.I honestly only felt impressed by what he went through during the ocean scenes and the first imprisonment. The narration of the movie kinda felt like this: 'I competed in the Olympics, my brother taught me to never give up, I survived 45 days at sea (long anecdote about the perils of the sea and losing my friend), I came home after being in a Japanese POW camp for two years.'I'm sure that the cliché 'the book is better' applies here, and I know that Louis Zamperini has his own book that is considered better than this movie's namesake. I wanted an emotional, unbelievable story where I cared about the characters... I got that for half a movie and proceeded to become unattached as the movie dragged on.Score: 5/10",5,2,5,5 January 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Better than the original
","In the tradition of blockbuster trilo-quadrilogies Catching Fire is better than the original.Having read the books about a year before the first movie, I can't attest to how close the movie was to the book, but after what I saw on screen, I don't care. The plot flowed and intensity scaled effortlessly; nothing felt rushed, nothing felt left out.Jennifer Lawrence is a rare talent and still fully commits to the role of Katniss even though she's struck gold already with Silver Linings and probably Hustle as well. She's matured the character from the save-my- skin scrapper of the original to the nuanced survivor in Catching Fire. I do know Kat has a lot of inner-dialogue in the novel, and the script is commendable in the fact that there is zero voice-over. They lean heavily on Lawrence's ability and she delivers impeccably. The rest of the cast was better-than-average, and it was a delight seeing the characters come alive. Joanna and Finnick were played with the perfect blend of charm and ferocity, and Beetle is a character that could have easily been overdone, but wasn't. I also appreciate that the love-triangle is anti-Twilight in the sense that there is a real love between the characters, but they don't spend the trilogy pining over one-another. The characters are mature and act like there is more on the line than who's with who. I watched the first movie before heading to the theaters, and the director was a huge upgrade, Hunger Games' shaky camera was a distraction; also the costume and set design showed a high level of originality and felt like the Panem from the novel.I can't wait for Part 1 and 2 of Mockingjay to come out, I only wish they would've taken a page from Peter Jackson's book, and filmed the entire series at once. 9/10",9,1,19,3 December 2013
Get Him to the Greek," Sometimes funny, often uncomfortable.
","To start, I didn't want to see this movie, but some friends dragged me to it. It was lude, it was crude; everything you would expect from Russell Brand.The characters weren't very realistic at all- Aaron downing a flask of whiskey so that Aldus couldn't drink it (instead of dumping it out), Aaron's girlfriend not breaking up with him after hearing him have sex while butt dialing her, and then her decision in the super awkward last scene. It also bugged me that Jonah was not reprising his role from Sarah Marshall, but Russell was- not a huge distraction, but I thought it lazy.Some of the funnier lines came from P. Diddy, but it was all script and had nothing to do with his acting; he's terrible. Rose Byrne also gave a weak performance, and her character's songs didn't even toy with innuendo, they were 100% genuine filth. The songs were perhaps the grossest bits of dialogue in the film.The timing of some of the scenarios is also really, really off. More than once we're told that they have 'less than an hour to get to the airport' while stuck in traffic. In the three hours before his show we're shown Aldus visiting Jackie and having sex with her, Aldus visiting Aaron and trying to threesome with him and his girlfriend, and Aldus finding an exclusive party and getting wasted where he falls in a pool and learns his lesson.One redeeming quality of the movie is Brand, who is just an awkward accident waiting to happen, you can't stop watching him. The other is the not-so-subtle addiction and loneliness theme personified in Aldus, it gave the film some context and a little bit of heart amidst all the ludity.",5,6,15,22 June 2010
Up in the Air," Gut Wreching Realism
","I went and saw this movie after hearing all the buzz, and decided I needed to see it for myself. Besides the friend I was with, I was the youngest person there by 30 years (I'm 24). Minutes into the movie, I realized why.Many of the early firings are people that valued themselves as 'Company Men' and the air of hopelessness that surrounds the idea that a loyal employee of 15+ years isn't safe from downsizing is all too real. My own father recently lost his job at the company he's worked for 28 years.The desperation the fresh faced college grad has after realizing the gravity of her job is a rude awakening to a generation that already has huge trust issues. We're expected to be loyal to companies we work for, yet they reserve the right to fire us at the drop of a hat. It's a wonder that my generation is so fickle in who we share our lives with.The most flooring part of the movie comes when George Clooney's character and the girl walk into an office almost completely devoid of life and proceed to fire people who work at desks without walls, completely vulnerable.Vera's character made me absolutely sick, I won't completely spoil the end of the movie, but I hated her character after developing this bond with her for the first hour.In the end we assume George Clooney's character flies off into the sunset back into his hopeless life, absent of any meaningful relationships.The movie is a 'dark comedy' but some of the subject matter is so real and close to home, that I forgot about the funny parts altogether. I have never seen a movie that is so 'for it's time' and I appreciate what Reitman created.",9,1,3,15 January 2010
