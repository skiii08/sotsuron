The Sound of Music," Excellent in every way!
","Don't dismiss this film as an impetulant musical. It is a glorious film with many layers. If you have not seen this film, it is a must see for all ages. I am not a musical movie type, but found myself more empowered by this film. Go buy the 40th Anniversary DVD, to get all of the details on the making of this monumental film. Julie Andrews best work, and Christopher Plummer is so imbedded as the Captain, what else can be said. The location, Salzburg Austria, is the some of the most beautiful film to be captured in major-motion picture. You can only imagine if the film was produced now, with all of the technology of today! I don't know why this film doesn't rate higher on the list.",10,4,12,29 December 2006
