Blade Runner 2049," Masters at work
","Bladerunner 2049 is the sequel to the widely acclaimed original Sci Fi masterpiece Bladerunner, directed by Ridley Scott. The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Ryan Gosling as K, a Bladerunner who stumbles across a dark secret that leads to conflict, anguish and deep self-reflection; What is it that makes us human?As I sit here and think of how to even begin to comprehensively summarise my thoughts on this modern Sci-Fi masterpiece, I listen to the penultimate track 'Bladerunner' on Hanz Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's mesmerising score for the film and realise that it perfectly summarises how I feel.The song opens with no holds barred, a punchy introduction that thrusts you right into the tone of this world and refuses to let you go from that point onwards, just as the film does. This dystopia is saturated, and every frame drips with such colour and life that it appears cinematographer Roger Deakins is practically demanding your eye. Accompanied by a score and screenplay paralysing your body with intrigue, fear and anticipation from the very first frames, you will soon find yourself hooked.The middle section of the track then flows in. Subtle, mysterious, revelatory. It coincides magnificently with the second act of the film which takes the staple question of the original(what is it to be human?) and asks it on a new level: does the ability to recall our past and remember our childhood make us human? We explore this through the character of K, Gosling's quiet and wonderfully subtle protagonist, attempting to find his place in the world accompanied by Ana de Armas' Joi, another enrapturing performance complimenting a very intriguing character. Through them we experience all the things that make us 'human'. Fear, anxiety, joy, a sense of belonging. The film has something to say about them all. And then we reach our conclusion. Surprise after surprise. shock upon shock. The film refuses to release you right up until the instant the credits start rolling.Directed immaculately. Shot with a profound love for Ridley Scott's world and the craft of filmmaking. Scored to compliment each and every frame. Bladerunner 2049 is a true modern Sci-Fi masterpiece and a testament to how sequels should be done: nostalgic retrospect insighting new ideas, not acting as handcuffs, enabling the introduction of fresh and progressive ideas that new generations of moviegoers can ponder over for a long time to come.",10,2,8,17 October 2017
Justice League," Is it a bird!? Is it a plane!? No it's...it's Henry Cavill's moustache?
","Justice League, starring Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher finds DC's greatest heroes uniting in the face of apokolips to defeat their greatest enemy yet, one that they can only defeat as a team.This film has been a long time coming. Since the cancellation of George Miller's 2009 'Justice League: Mortal' fans have been eagerly awaiting seeing their favourite heroes unite on the big screen. Now after many years and the conception of Zack Snyder's new DC cinematic universe, the wishes of the fans have finally come true. But can this eagerly anticipated team up ever possibly satisfy the hunger of an audience with such high expectations? In short: no. Unfortunately for fans a combination of studio meddling, a lack of understanding of the characters at play, and some of the worst CGI I've ever seen has lead to a sloppy, sub-par superhero film rivalling the mediocrity of 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice'. The film isn't completely without merit and the most dedicated fans will likely find a lot to love, yet most will likely be very disappointed by this outing. Some of the characters here are handled fairly well, yet all in all the majority of the characters are plagued by poor writing, shallow characterisation and poorly timed quips: a desperate attempt to address the DCEU's tonal critics, leading to an uneven infrequent tone throughout. The high calibre of actors work with that they have, but what they have isn't much. I found the characters of Fisher's Cyborg and Affleck's Batman simply quite infuriating. Cyborg is portrayed as a hollow straight-faced version of his vibrant comic counterpart: why is one of the youngest most vibrant members of the team with the most potential for natural comedy being turned into something (no pun intended) robotic? As well as Batman being incredibly poorly written with seemingly no inner development as a character or inner turmoil of any kind: All further emphasising the idea that these filmmakers don't know what makes the characters that they are working with so endearing. Furthermore the film's villain is painfully weak, appearing as if the studio didn't even try. Steppenwolf is the absolute genre stereotype of what a supervillain is: big, dumb and ugly. Except that should be a template, a starting point, not the actual character. However it clearly is here. If a film is only as strong as its villain, Justice League is an outright failure. There are definitely some redeeming factors in the film however. Every scene in which the League sits down and converses is very entertaining to watch; The actors all have clear natural chemistry making their interactions a joy to experience on screen. Furthermore, some of the action sequences are fairly exciting and engaging, serving to keep your interest, and as previously mentioned some of the characters do shine at points throughout the film such as Cavill's Superman, who here is the best incarnation of the character as portrayed by Cavill that we've received yet. However again the film shoots itself in the foot, as every time Cavill comes on screen WB's abysmal attempt to remove his moustache is a complete failure and consequently a distraction that instantaneously removes you from the film: it's infuriating. All in all, Justice League for me is highly disappointing. It could have taken hugely beloved characters by me and many others, and made something that truly felt like a film crafted for the fans. Yet instead, corporate meddling with Zack Snyder's vision as well as the film effectively being directed by two different people (Joss Whedon) has lead to what seems like a pure mess. It has its positive qualities and for the most hardcore fans what they receive here will likely be enough. However, for the rest of us we'll have to keep on hoping that one day this property will fall in to the hands of someone with cares about the fans more than they do money, that can make something truly living up to our expectations, the worth of such rich characters, and the greats of DC comics.",5,0,1,28 November 2017
Princess Mononoke," Miyazaki's Fantasy Wonder
","Hayao Miyazaki isn't a name synonymous with fantasy epics grand and aggressive such as the Lord of The Rings, yet in a pleasant twist of fate it appears as if the renowned director has yet another genre wrapped around his finger, intertwining a vast yet personal epic with a profound message for the younger viewer in 1997's 'Princess Mononoke'.Suffering a cursed injury, Ashitaka, the last Emishi prince of the Emishi village, finds himself on a journey Westward bound to try and find a cure for his ever-worsening ailment. Along the way we meet a colourful cast of characters including the titular Princess Mononoke (San) and her band of wolves.Venturing into the wild Ashitaka discovers a town destroying the land around them, the home of the wolves, in order to develop iron, growing exponentially in power and wealth. Should this trope sound familiar to you it would be for good reason. For many years the issue of defamation of the natural world for the prosperity of humanity has been a frequently touched upon issue, yet from the get-go the beauty in this film is in its initial reluctance, and then outright refusal to take a side.The destructive mentality of the people of the ironworks is merely a community attempting to find its place in the world; they destroy to prevent themselves from being destroyed (as it is established clearly they are not the most powerful force in this world). They destroy in fear of being destroyed, in many ways a reflection of the aggressive animals they kill rather than a binary opposition. Following this train of thought, even the animals are not without fault. The forest is divided into tribes of different species, and amongst them it is clear that there is conflict. They bicker and fight all in a desperate bid to survive, much the reflection of ourselves.This conflict is centralised through our connection to Ashitaka whom from the first scenes retains a clear reverence for nature, smiling and gazing in wonder at its otherworldly beauty. He acts as us, the everyman, looking on in horror as two worlds that he adores and is familiar with crash together In fire and blood, a desperate bid for survival where no survival is guaranteed. He fits his role very well and plays off San well also, however if I did have one flaw with the film it would be that: in earlier scenes he seems to develop a connection with San that is only apparent to them and doesn't translate to the audience very well (yet one could always argue that the reason for this is as what they represent thematically usurps what they represent in emotional connection.)Speaking of fire and blood, this is by far one of the most unexpectedly violent Studio Ghibli films I have ever laid eyes on. From the first scene blood is abundant, limbs are lost and death reins over the land. However, unexpected as it threw me, out of place it was not. The violence perfectly reflects the theme previously mentioned; the disarray of the conflict at the centre of the film between the growth of industry and nature, senseless and heart-breaking.This profound melancholy surrounding the theme yet contrasts itself with joyous human moments sprinkled throughout the film in romance, friendship etc. all heightened by a mesmerising score and Ghibli's signature rich vibrant visuals, which both make the world we're exploring feel full, truly living and breathing.Princess Mononoke is a film which takes risks, hovering in-between the side of nature's right to rule and the roaring progress of industrialisation, yet never wavering in its resolve. It knows that the issue isn't black and white, with dynamic elements frequently affecting the actions of both man and beast, with violence resulting from confusion, and a sense of pensive grief hanging over the film. Through all this conflict, neither side overcomes in the end, with the beauty of life itself being the true victory, a truly profound message for both children and adults alike.",9,1,1,8 May 2019
