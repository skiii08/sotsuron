Conquest 1453," Best History Movie
","I think this movie is one of the best historical movie ever made.The crew was perfect and story telling was magnificent.The effects used in the movie was just enough and also it could cope with other Hollywood movies as well.This movie deserves every penny spend for it.With this movie,my faith in Turkish movie industry started to grow back.Mistakes will be done,but in time these mistakes will be solved and much better movies will come.I think Turkish movie industry rose from its heavy dust on it and hopefully more good films will come.I hope the next movie will be about Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and how he helped this nation to earn its freedom again.",8,21,59,19 February 2012
