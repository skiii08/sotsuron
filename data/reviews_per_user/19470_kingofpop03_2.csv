E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Epic Masterpiece that put Spielberg on the top of the world
","About 23 years ago, Steven Spielberg made a film inspired by his lonely childhood life particularly his parents' divorce and came release day, without question became the ultimate king of the box office hit film of the year 1982. It was called 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' and it was a story that forever touched the world.The Sci-Fi Drama which told the heartwarming story about friendship, loyalty, devotion and most of all love. When a spaceship lands, one of the visitors is left behind. Then he finds shelter in a young boy's tool shed of his home. They're first encounter is rather scary for the both of them. But once they meet again, they begin to get along with each other. The young boy named Elliott (potrayed by a young Henry Thomas)decides to take in the harmless loving creature into his home, but when he does he discovers that he and E.T. have far more in common than either one of them ever thought. Elliott later recruits his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) for help to find out where E.T. is from and what they can do get him back home safe and sound. But there's only one problem: the government is after him and the kids will do anything to protect the alien with their lives. At one point, E.T.'s life shatters and falls into complete illness along with Elliott's as well. E.T. dies which leaves the boy in complete sadness, but it's Gertie who's absolutely shocked to see this happen to a very special friend she loves so much, even she much like her brother would never let him die. Filled with tears the last thing we all could want is to wish for him to return. And it's fulfilled when he surprisingly resurrects to life! Now Elliott, along with Michael and co. must transport him to the forest of E.T.'s rendezvous point dodging government and local authorities. Mission Accomplished. Once the spaceship arrives, E.T.'s adventure on Earth is finally over. Although he must leave to live on, but it means saying farewell to those who nourished him and fought for him. Gertie gives the creature a pot full of flowers and a passionate kiss on his face(on of my favorite scenes in the film). He later thanks Michael for everything and gives a heartwarming hug to the one who loved him like a brother: Elliott. He later boarded the ship, it took off and left a signature of peace between man and alien: A RAINBOW!!In the end this turned out to be a film almost everyone can learn about true friendship and love. I can relate to Elliott because I was living the exact same way he was, but I can also connect with E.T. himself. Because he was the kind of friend who is so special, there's no other friend you can think of otherwise. In my mind, this is one of the greatest achievements from Master Spielberg and the most popular American classic film of all time that is to forever be treasured and loved as well as appreciated at the same time. I don't care if it's kiddie or dull BECAUSE IT'S NOT!! (for all you dumb shits who didn't like the movie), it's the classic that forever changed the face of American cinematic history and broke box office records from all over the world. everyone else can say what they want, believe what they want. But it will not change anything, nor my viewing of the film because I can watch it so many times and never get tired of it, NEVER!! The truth is that this is an epic masterpiece and deserves better as it should have more than 20 years ago, so for Spielberg, you are the man!!",10,1,2,27 March 2005
The Incredibles," From Retirment to Going back into Action by Force
","The latest masterpiece from Walt Disney and Pixar was unquestionably to say the least 'SO INCREDIBLE!!' Robert 'Bob' Parr (Craig T. Nelson)was once known as the world greatest superhero 'MR. INCREDIBLE' fighting evil as well as crime on a daily basis. His wife Helen Parr (Holly Hunter)was also one of the world's greatest superheros as well: 'ELASTIGIRL'. Then you have Lucius Best alias 'FROZONE' (Samuel L. Jackson) another great superhero considered to be cool and wild. But it's not long until a string full of lawsuits forces them to give up their costumes and enter the government's superhero relocation program where they're to live normal lives among today's citizens. Now Fifteen years later, Bob and Helen are now living in the suburban neighborhood raising a family of three children: Dash, Violet and Jack-Jack Parr. Bob wants nothing more than to relive the glory days as Mr. Incredible because whenever someone's in trouble, there's nothing he or anyone can do about it. Then one day he gets a mysterious communication from a secret agent to spring back into action which he reluctantly accepts and from there it's 'Showtime!'. But when he arrives, he is shocked to discover that the whole assignment was a trap set by a nemesis from his past: his ex-biggest fan Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) who calls himself Syndrome. After Helen discovers the truth, she has no choice but to return to her former superhero life as Elastigirl and rescue her husband. Along with the super speeding Dash and the invisible yet tricky Violet, the family must come together and save the world from Syndrome if they are to stop him from becoming a hero as he plans to fake to be one just by eliminating a high tech weapon only HE can defeat. In the end, the Parr family learn that when it comes to saving the world, they can never abandon their true selves no matter what. There are so many elements this movie represents such as family, loyalty, yearning for another chance to be who you once were. But in the end, you come to cope with being who you are and who you want to be. In short, the story was excellent, the 3-D computer animation was completely awesome and the movie itself was truly, accurately INCREDIBLE!! I highly recommend it to all those who have not yet seen it.",10,1,2,27 March 2005
