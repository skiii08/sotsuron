The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Best Twilight Yet
","For someone who has read the books, I am more critical than most people and I believe it was the best one yet. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 is almost completely based off the book. I loved it. The actors have really advanced in their acting since the very first one and a lot since the previous one, The Twilight Saga Eclipse. Especially, Kristin Stewart. She has had a lot of trouble showing emotions in the other movies, but in Breaking Dawn Part 1 she has really expanded her talents and made Bella a very round character. I couldn't have been more pleased with the movie. Only one cuss word and no nudity, but there is definitely innuendo.",10,1,8,1 February 2012
Tangled," Best Disney Movie Since Lion King
","I absolutely, totally, and completely loved this movie! This is the best movie since The Lion King! As soon as you watch it, you might as well buy the DVD because you will be wanting to watch it over and over and over again. It's the classical tale of Rapunzel with a twist that is endearing and wonderful. You will be smiling and laughing through the whole thing and maybe even crying. It's a heart warming movie that will have your whole family sucked in from beginning to end. It is for all ages and all ages should see it. It will instantly become one of your favorite Disney movies, if not one of your favorite movies period. I have yet to meet someone who didn't like it. If you are looking for a movie your whole family can watch and cheer you up, this is definitely the film to watch!",10,25,28,1 February 2012
