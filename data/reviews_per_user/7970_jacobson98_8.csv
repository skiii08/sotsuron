The King's Speech," Just OK
","I'm predisposed to like anything with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter. All give fine performances in this film. And I'm a fan of most British historical dramas. But this film just doesn't work for me. Prince/King has a stutter, works with coach to get it under control and that's the film. Nothing much happens. We walk away not knowing anything new about the King, the Monarchy, the UK, the speech coach, etc.My overwhelming reaction to this film was boredom. Nothing much happens. There's only one scene in the movie I found interesting. When the speech coach's wife returns home and finds the Queen of England sipping tea in her dining room, I actually had a chuckle or two.Watch if you're a fan of Firth or Rush -- their performances are noteworthy. Helena Bonham Carter is fine but her part is actually rather small. Alas, not much else to recommend it. Yes, I know I seem to be out of step with the IMDb voters and Academy Award nominators, but I just couldn't find a way to like this film.",6,4,9,19 February 2011
Knowing," One of the Worst!
","One of the worst films I've ever seen. Makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like genius. It starts out fine setting a nice mystery. But Nicolas Cage's first appearance brings the film to almost a complete stop. I kept hoping the film would pick up the pace -- alas, when it did towards the climax the plot totally fell apart. There is no character development, no plot development and no reason to go see this film unless you're really dying for some movie popcorn. Perhaps, if you think that the movie industry needs a bailout, you might be willing to pay for this stinker. Oh, and the supporting actors stink, too. The kids are forgettable, the supporting actors, especially Rose Byrne, are atrocious. IMDb does not allow a zero stars rating -- shame, this film deserves one.",1,5,12,28 March 2009
Dreamgirls," Terribly Disappointing
","Dreamgirls has some wonderful things in it -- a wonderful debut by Jennifer Hudson, a dynamite performance by Eddie Murphy, some wonderful musical numbers and great singing but it simply doesn't hang together as a movie. The story and narrative are constantly getting lost and the most consistent emotion I felt while viewing was boredom.The editing of this movie is strange and distracting -- a reaction shot of Jamie Foxx seems to cut off his response to other actors, a shot of swiveling hips in a musical number seems out of place, dramatic scenes are brought to a dead stop by images which don't seem to belong.While Hudson and Murphy shine, Jamie Foxx playing the Barry Gordy roll seems out of place, mugging his way through a roll that calls for subtlety. Keith Robinson is a disaster as the songwriter C.C. White, leaving no imprint on the role whatsoever.I have to put the blame for this disaster on writer/director Bill Condon. The adaptation from the stage version just isn't successful and the acting is so inconsistent one can only look to the director for its failure. Dreamgirls is worth seeing, at least on video, for some wonderful songs. But if you're looking for a satisfying movie experience, give this one a miss.",3,2,8,12 January 2007
Black Snake Moan," A Film That Will Stay With You
","I saw this film cold ... hadn't read reviews, hadn't seen any ads, didn't have any expectations. And it blew me away! The story is about people searching for their souls and you just might find your own in the process of watching it. Like the 'blues' played throughout the picture, you're high, you're low, you're happy, you're sad, you're hungry, you're thirsty, you're satiated, you're alive. And what makes you feel best in life is doing both for yourself and for others.I walked away from the film with feelings coursing through me and thoughts jumbling out of my brain. True art is supposed to move you emotionally and intellectually and this movie certainly did that for me.The leads are sensational ... they are their characters without ever a false note. And the supporting characters add a perfect punctuation to the piece.I don't suspect everyone will like this movie -- it's an odd little piece that's difficult to pigeonhole. I don't know if I could watch it again -- possibly too emotionally exhausting. But it's certainly a film I'll think about for years to come.",8,1,4,17 March 2007
Invictus," Excellent Film!
","Not only did I love this movie, but so did my wife who knows little about rugby and hates sports movies. It's not really a sports movie but rather an example of political leadership. With Clint Eastwood directing it's historically accurate and makes its points quietly and without over dramatization. Someone unaware of the history of South Africa during the 1980s and 1990s might struggle to understand what's happening but the movie will quietly answer all your questions although it might make you wait awhile and it will make you think. Morgan Freeman commands the screen while underplaying, the kind of trick that brings award nominations. Matt Damon is brings immense tension to a quiet part. The star of the movie is the simple idea of reaching across to black/white divide to bond over what had been a sport mainly for South African whites. This movie is yet another reminder that Clint Eastwood has become the most dependable and most accomplished American director.",9,2,3,24 December 2009
The Queen," Sensational Film
","This is a sensational film that deserves every accolade it has received. For the first few minutes of the film I was aware that Helen Mirren was playing a part but for the remainder I thought I was privy to the Queen of England and her personal thoughts. The goal of all acting is to make one forget they are watching a performance. Helen Mirren gives a wonderful performance that is the cornerstone of a wonderful film, at once showing the Queen as musty and magnificent. This is a film that everyone in Britain can embrace. You see all sides of the fallout following the car accident death of Princess Diana in Paris and you feel empathy for all those sides. For an American, I perhaps finally had an inkling as to what the monarchy means to Britain -- a cornerstone of their democracy, a keeper of tradition and their national integrity, immune to the random opinion and yet sensitive to its people. This is a film that lays out the monarchy to criticism and admiration at the same time -- quite a feat. Cheers for Helen Mirren and director Stephen Frears -- for me this is the film of 2006!",10,0,2,22 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Huge Disappointment
","This film is essentially a remake of the original Star Wars (episode IV) and, for me, it was a huge disappointment. The original film had many visual effects that were new and original. Working with the much enhanced palette of computer graphics, this film is visually boring and introduces nary an original image or sequence. The creativity that turned a space soap opera into the most influential film of its time is sadly lacking in this new opus. The film introduces a set of new characters for the many Star Wars sequels yet to come. And again, not one really strikes a creative note as a basis for future episodes. I loved the original three Star Wars (IV, V and VI). This film is a miss.",5,20,23,11 July 2016
The Fighter," Unsatisfying
","Why does a film with great performances by Christian Bale, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams leave one so unsatisfied? First, Mark Wahlberg is the lead and he has difficulty holding up his part against the showy performances by the already mentioned trio of Bale, Leo and Adams. Many newspaper articles questioned why Wahlberg was not nominated for an Oscar while his three costars were. My simple answer is that his performance is not very good. (Yes, its difficult for a star to hold a film together while his supporting players get to chew the scenery. But real stars can -- think Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs, holding the focus of the film against Tony Hopkins over-the-top performance.) Second, the film starts as a character study and ends up being a sports history picture. The ending feels like a different film compared to the beginning and middle. The structure and writing of the film leave something to be desired. Bottom line - you'll find several of the performances worth watching but you might find the film lacking.",6,2,6,28 February 2011
