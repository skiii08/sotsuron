The Expendables 2," A must watch movie for all action lovers - 10/10
","On the whole, there was absolutely no storyline in Expendables-2, even when compared to the previous one. But the rest is just Mind Blowing. The Director has really picked unseen exotic locations like the Bulgaria caves, the dense fog forests,.. The background score was matching all those 'bang/boom/thaw' blows of the entire crew. Disappointed to see no Tom & Jerry fight between Lundgren & Li.I think Stephen Seagal was the only one left out from this 'Hollywood veteran tough guys group'. Liam Hemsworth has done his job perfectly, despite of his tiny role. Only God knows from where Norris comes & goes between those section scenes. Unmatchable stunts. The climax fight between Statham-Adkins & Stallone-Van Damme could've lasted few more seconds. A must watch movie for all action lovers - 10/10",10,3,14,17 August 2012
Skyfall," Bond is back with the Bang
","Earlier, many of the critics rated the movie as the best Bond film, ever made. They were correct.Starting from the Roof top bike chase in Istanbul till the sentimental climax, Daniel Craig has shown his poise in each and every frame. The action and stunts scenes were fast and neat. Should definitely appreciate the costume designer for the perfect fit suits designed for stunts.Unlike other Bond movies, there is a lack of pace in the script as most of the story revolves only in London & Scotland with less importance in scenes pertaining to Shanghai, Macau & Istanbul. But the less, was equated with excellent cinematography and the best direction. Javier Bardem's role as villain was not only elegant, but proved himself with the vengeance on his eyes. The music however is totally different from glossy bond theme, but likable. All over, the movie was so elaborate and enjoyable, especially the climax. The good news is 'Bond is back with the bang.' - 8.5 / 10.",10,11,31,26 October 2012
