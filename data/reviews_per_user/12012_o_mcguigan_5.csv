Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Painfully funny
","You know that feeling that you get when you've been laughing so hard and your side hurts? Well this is one of those films. Its a total shock fest!! I'd just like to say to all the people that rate this film badly, You have no sense of humor or you are from Kazakhstan.It is hilarious to the last. Its obvious that its pitched for a general Borat fan base new and long time followers as some stuff is repeated from earlier series episodes but the fun is all there. Its more of a tout at Americans than at Kazakhstan to be honest. How they react is what the film is all about! If it wasn't for their reactions it would not be as good so its not fair to say that this is not a good film. Its a well made, hilarious movie of a character that has many many more opportunities as far as sequels go.A must for DVD Collectors and anyone with a good sense of humor.",10,8,13,5 September 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Strange show
","So there were a few things about this movie that didn't make a whole pile of sense to me; > There were chapters.....Why?.... > Modern Music during.....Hardly scene setting? > Brad Pitt & Mike Myers were not in serious roles and sometimes I got the feeling they were about to start laughing. > Samuel L. Jackson narrated for 4 - 5 minutes. > The mutilation was far over the top to the point of unbearable. > Sheer fiction > Basterds isn't a word.I sincerely get the feeling that Quentin couldn't stretch himself out of his usual format with this movie.Scenes were sometimes long winded and a little pointless. Most roles in this movie were cameo's and there wasn't really a lead actor.Like I said, I still don't get what this movie is trying to say but it reminded me an awful lot of Dr. Strangelove.",6,4,10,22 August 2009
Ghost Rider," Bad, oh SO bad...
","Picture this, A father and son in a carnival doing daredevil stunts and one day his father is diagnosed with cancer. The devil turns up on the sons doorstep and offers him help in offer for his soul. This sets the scene for the comic which to be honest isn't the best of story lines for a hero story but it seems to work on paper. In Cinema its a different story altogether. The cast for this film were poorly chosen as Nick seems to be a very powerful actor and has a great screen presence for many other genres but not this one. As the film progresses this comes more and more evident. The story line loses its way somewhere in the film and for some reason we have a hero and no real bad guy. This is kind of a fundamental to be honest and makes the whole film rather pointless.There was not one redeeming feature in this film. This has to be some of the most terrible acting and story I have ever seen. Original comic was not done any justice and Nick Cage was horrific in this. The dialog was positively comical, I mean sometimes you could almost see the actors smirking as they say their lines. This has to be the worst of the worst for 2007 films by far. I was gutted I paid money to see it in the cinema...",1,0,3,1 June 2007
Transformers," Prepare yourself for a graphical action packed masterpiece!!!
","I'll never forget going to see the original 'Transformers; The Movie' in the late eighties and loving it then. Of course back then only cartoons could create such a title. 20 years later I could not realise how a tiny little piece of my mind had been neglected for so long. As the film progressed it woke that part of me that loves the story, the characters and all the action. Lets face it, Transformers are for the kid in all of us, the person that rates this badly has turned their back on that child. I however, have not.So firstly, The cast of this film aren't amazing but Shia LaBeouf is a real character in this show. I've been a watcher of his for years and he is a naturally funny guy and a great choice for Sam. Having said that, its not about humans further than Sam. The Transformers are all without a doubt spectacular and created with such care and detail. I have never witnessed graphics of this nature on film or even on computer. Its simply a masterpiece as far as computer graphics go.If I could change one thing in this film it would be the 'Armageddon' style music and camera work. They are 2 different films and should remain so. I felt a little let down by that but given the highs of this film the lows were leagues below.If you are reading this and deliberating watching this stop reading and get it immediately. I will actually buy a HD TV and HD Video with surround sound just to play this title in HD and call it money well spent. God I cant wait for the next one.",10,2,5,13 July 2007
The Simpsons Movie," An end of what is a truly burned out show
","I was a huge Simpson's fan for years until they just clean ran out of story lines. So, they began to recycle other peoples story lines, Go completely absurd and just became not funny any more. This show is clutching at what the Simpson's once was while toying with a story line that was very boring and totally UN-inventive. To be honest, Its a product that is at the very end of a wonderful life as feint glow of what it was. A few laughs throughout but only a feint sparkle of what the show once was. I do not recommend this in the Cinema as it is of a TV standard only. You'll just be disappointed if you do. On a better note there are some closures to some story lines from the TV show and a few political stabs at the real world. Overall it gets a big thumbs down, Simpson's fans will watch it anyway and the show is geared to set the producers up with a final cash cow before the bitter end. Go spend the money on one of the earlier Seasons on DVD and you'll have spent your money much wiser.",1,10,20,5 August 2007
