Scarface," You kiss me if I have hat?
","Spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league.But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent. Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.Ah well, the script ain't too hot either. Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the while.",3,19,40,29 December 2003
Spider-Man 2," Peter-Parker 2 *SPOILERS*
","I don't understand why this movie has a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. X-Men 2, while not being a cinematic masterpiece, held my attention throughout, and even made me smile repeatedly. I loved the ending. I should say that I am a long-time Spider-Man fan (subscribed for over ten years) and enjoy comic book movies, so it's not the subject matter that is the problem for me. It's just the crappy movie making. Really.Peter-Parker 2--sorry--Spider-Man 2 has several obvious problems.1) Say it with me: Exposition!The intro credits are beautiful, and cleverly establishes the back story from the first movie. But for some reason we still get to hear the whole story told again in the movie, in one of the most annoyingly slow scenes.I don't know how many scenes there are where characters have long monologues explaining to the audience what their motivations are, how they are thinking, what will happen next, and so on. Sometimes they have another character standing in front of them, but they aren't really speaking to them, they're speaking to us. This is evidenced by the fact that sometimes they don't have anyone in front of them, or even in the same room. They are just speaking out loud, talking to themselves.There is a saying that anyone who has taken a writing class will have heard many times: show don't tell. But in Peter-Parker 2, nothing is shown. Everything important comes out of the mouths of the characters instead of being played out for us on the screen. Every motivation, every conflict, every idea.Peter Parker says loudly to himself: 'I can't tell M.J. that I'm Spider-Man. My enemies would never leave her alone!' (Or something like that.) What enemies?? Spidey has enemies? The Goblin is dead, Doc Ock isn't around yet, and we have seen no other enemies. He's imagining things. Out loud. It would have been a good idea to show us some of these enemies.One of the funniest sequences, that actually had me laughing out loud, was when Aunt May tells Peter about the young boy from next door who idolizes Spider-Man. Somewhere in the monologue the line turns from a story about the boy next door to a motivational speech for disillusioned superheroes. It's so blam in-our-faces it cracked me up. And it wasn't a nice chuckle.There isn't a plot point in the story that couldn't have benefited from more scenes where stuff happens, and less talk.2) Spider-Man should be about Spider-ManI know, I know. The Spidey comic was so great because Peter Parker is a realistic character with ordinary problems and, like, dimensions and stuff. But we didn't buy the comic because we wanted to read about Peter Parker. We bought it because it was about Spider-Man. Peter Parker is an attribute of Spider-Man. He is Spider-Man's secret identity, not the other way around. What made us nerds really like Spidey was that during the day he was this feeble nobody with few friends who Flash could pick on--but we knew that he wasn't really like that at all. He could lift a van over his head and had the wittiest lines in Comic-Verse. That was how he really was.Sam Raimi seems to think that he is honoring the comic by making it about Peter Parker's love stories firstly, and about Spider-Man's struggles against super-evil secondly, but he isn't. He just misunderstands the concept. Peter Parker's life is seasoning. Spidey's battles with villains is the real subject matter.This shines through in the casting as well. As much as I like Toby in most movies, he's not a good Spider-Man. (In the very few scenes when he and not a CGI effect is Spider-Man, I mean.) Parker/Spidey are two radically different characters, as is so often the case. (I mean Kent/Superman? Banner/Hulk?) But Maquire is Peter Parker ALL the time. In the movie, Spidey is just Peter Parker with a Spandex mask over his head, and that is simply wrong.3) Lousy crookI bet you thought Doc Ock was real cool, huh? Yeah, he looked pretty mean and was decently acted. But think about it. What is his motivation? He MUST finish the project at any cost! He MUST make a mini sun on Manhattan, whatever the consequences! Why? Who knows? Whatever, he's just a subplot in the movie about Peter Parker's somewhat predictable love story anyway, right? Compare Doc Ock with Magneto in X-Men. Magneto used to be in a Jewish concentration camp in Germany. Non-mutants are trying to force all mutants to register with the authorities. He's starting to recognize the old pattern. Add some pathological megalomania to the mix and the result is inevitable. He overreacts, and goes on the war path against humanity. Meanwhile, Doc Ock MUST make his little sun, and nothing will stop him! Jeez, Magneto is a Shakespearian character in comparison. (And that has nothing to do with that McKellen has played Richard III on the big screen.) The script writers didn't care very much about the Doctor Octopus plot because Spider-Man is a sensitive story about a young man with relationship problems, doubts about his future, and such uncertainties as young men are wont to have. Ptooey to that! Bring in the doomsday machines!What about the good stuff?There is some. J.K Simmons as J. Jona Jameson is absolutely wonderful. Every scene he is in is pure pleasure. His lines are okay but his delivery is perfect. Jameson is an important character in Spidey's life. The movie also has its moments when the drama works. Most of the time it drowns in exposition or never lifts off because of poorly established motivations, but there are exceptions. When M.J sees Peter as Spidey near the end is one such exception. The earlier train scene also works action-wise, and is more or less the only one that really does. Dunst is good, although under-utilized throughout.And the intro credits are some of the coolest I have ever seen. I wonder who the artist is?",4,5,17,8 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not quite Buffy
","Such crisp colors, unusual and creative camera angles, and modern-sounding music. And the killing and maiming and high-pressure blood showers sure pass the time (sorta). But if you're looking for depth and/or substance, I recommend The Simpsons or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The story is like a comic book hater's idea of comic booky. (The protagonist knows her former coworkers and nemeses so well she has to note their silly nicknames under their names in her 'kill list'?)A hint: In ten years, when the color schemes and the music and the quirky imagery of this movie don't feel quite so modern anymore, don't rent it. It'll age like a fine bottle of Seven-Up.",Null,0,1,13 March 2004
Carrie," Unique horror
","I watch horror movies like I watch a fantasy or science fiction flick. What I want is usually the paranormal mystery that needs resolving, and the revelation at the end. I live for the twist. Very few horror movies have actually scared me. I can think of two. Trouble Every Day, with Vincent Gallo and BÃ©atrice Dalle, made me feel genuinely sick in a way that no other movie has and like I thought none could. The other is Carrie, which made my hair stand on end several times. I mean, I was seriously creeped out.I think that for me it was a combination of DePalma's imagery--Spacek is a truly haunting figure, pure nightmare stuff--and the script. And here's what makes Carrie unique. It is actually a character-driven horror story. It just doesn't not follow the mandatory horror movie formula, but it takes its motivation and narrative momentum from the very realistically depicted inner torment of the protagonist. This had the effect of emotionally grounding the story for me, so that when all hell breaks loose, and the blood-drenched Spacek stares at us with empty eyes, it was the proverbial fist squeezing my guts.Recommended viewing, especially if you are wary of the boring standard-compliant stuff.",8,2,3,24 June 2004
Identity," Non-linear storytelling (SPOILERS!)
","** Spoilers ** Spoilers ** Spoilers ** Spoilers **(First, since some seem to have problems with this part: Ginny and the boy disappears at the moment when all the bodies are disappearing. They are assumed to have been killed and the bodies vaporized, just as all the other corpses have been.)This movie is very much in the same school as Usual Suspects, in that it has a 'waking up in the shower' (expression born with the 'twist' in the Dallas soap) twist. But just as in Usual Suspects, it works!If you expect a regular monster movie, you'll either be happily surprised or disappointed. In my own opinion, this was something far more interesting and sophisticated than I had expected. Like Usual Suspects, the story breaks the rules of conventional storytelling, but does it successfully. However, it _demands_ of you as a viewer that you go along with it.It helps to have read some 'surreal' writers, such as Philip K. Dick or William Burroughs. To have a mind that's conditioned to go with the flow and accept that a story can be relevant on a purely associative level, even if what it describes isn't consistent or 'real' even in its own story universe. Even if it's not real, it can still be relevant. The story in Usual Suspects--which is a lie--is relevant because it's Keyser Soze's way of escaping the law and demonstrating his superiority over the smart police officer. In Identity the story--which is a figment of the protagonist's imagination--is relevant because he's fighting a battle with his multiple personalities and his life is at stake.(I should add that the story is psychologically whole unbelievable, but that's not important. It's also hard to understand why we should root for the killer. If you're an opponent of the death penalty, it may be interesting to see that he's not executed.)Anyone who's tried their hand at writing fiction knows how hard it is to follow the rules. Breaking them successfully is a whole different ballgame. Identity is skillfully written and adequately (and then some) executed. Personally I'm delighted that Hollywood has the guts to give us something more advanced than the usual formulaic thrills at times. I'd even go so far as to claim that it's these types of movies that advance the medium in the mainstream, even if Usual Suspects and, for example Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys, are superior movies and have been more important in that respect.",Null,0,0,29 January 2004
Sin City," 'What a sweet kid.'
","The movie is running right now in a little window right next to this one. I knew the comic quite well and I've followed Miller's work since the 80's, and I've been reading this board, so I pretty much knew what to expect. However, one thing I didn't expect was all the goddamned, never-ending babbling. Some of it is _extremely_ expeditionary... 'And then I blah blah, and I thought blah blah blah, and therefore I will now blah blah blah, and I bet you never thought of this, blah blah blah blah frigging blah BLAH!' They make Blofeld look tongue-tied! It never ends! My eeeeaaaaaaarsssss!!!!! You know, hard men don't talk incessantly. Sort of a rule of thumb that you might pick up if you watch a Sergio Leone movie. (Bet Rodriguez has never watched a spaghetti western...) Oh well, anyway. Some of it looks cool, although I can't quite figure out if it actually looks cool, or if it's just me going, 'hey! that's looks exactly like the comic!' It's not really the same thing. I'm glad they had the '-Haven't seen you around in a while. -I had to kill some cops'-frame, although they softened up the dialog. Go figure.Mickey Rourke's talk over is the only one that works, mostly because his voice is so messed up you can't really tell if he's wincing or not. Owen's is a close second, and that's just because parts of his... part, works really good as comedy. I think it was even meant as comedy. Bruce Willis is so not pulling this off. You can tell he's got nothing but grapes on his mind when he reads the first part of the voice-over. I guess he's been in enough movies to recognize cheese when he sees it, even if he's no big thinker (and never claimed to be, hey, I like the guy).Every now and then I get an 'art movie' vibe. Then I quickly realize that it's because periodically, it's boring like an art movie. I really have liked the Owen part best so far, it had some funny bits and pieces.All in all, I don't hate the movie. I can sort of chuckle along with Miller and Rodriguez frequently enough to make it worth the watch, and that's more than I can say for most films I see. But you know something? I watched the Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes Chain of Command I and II yesterday, and in that episode of a weekly TV series for young adults, during a few scenes where Picard is tortured by the 'Cardassians,' there is better acting, more plot, more substance, and more actual characters, than this movie has produced in toto. And that, at the end of the day, gotta mean something.",Null,1,3,29 April 2005
