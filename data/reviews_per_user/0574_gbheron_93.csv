The Devil's Advocate," Not Quite Up to Standards
","Keanu Reeves plays a young lawyer lured to New York City from his small town law practice by the promise of fame and fortune.  The big-shot law firm doing the luring is run by Al Pacino, and needless to say doings at the firm are not all they seem.  A little bit Rosemary's Baby with a tad of Angel Heart thrown in, Devil's Advocate doesn't deliver the dramatic punch of either of these movies.  It doesn't scare, and it almost appears it is not really trying to.  That's not too good an approach for a supernatural thriller.Not a loss of money for a rental by any stretch, but if you really want a jolt, look elsewhere.",7,1,2,11 September 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Innovative, and Very Scary
","By the time I finally got around to watching 'The Blair Witch Project' I was well aware of all the hype surrounding this film; about the shoe-string budget, novice director and actors, and just how damn scary it was. I wanted to see it long ago, but never got around to it fearing I would be disappointed. Well I watched it the other night, alone and in the dark to heighten the effect. Before the movie was half over, I had turned on all the lights. Beyond a doubt, this is a very scary movie. And the home-movie style and amateur acting is what pulls you in to the kid's nightmare trip to the Maryland woods. Very, very innovative and very, very effective. If you like a good scare, don't miss this one.",9,1,2,29 September 2001
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Touched by an Angel: The Movie
","***Spoiler*** In 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', Robert Redford reprises his strategy of using sport as a vehicle to achieve personal redemption and deep spiritual understanding.  As in 'The Horse Whisperer' a lone mystic comes to the aid of a deeply troubled person, and through sport (golf instead of horse whispering) imparts mystic knowledge. Also, like the precedent film, 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is insufferable. The plot is unbelievable. At least the Robert Redford character in the 'The Horse Whisperer' was a flesh and blood human (although imbued with such saintly virtues that I took an immediate dislike to him). But Bagger Vance is an angel or god or something. No way I'm buying that. A black angel selects a depressed white guy (and a Southerner) to help find himself and his golf swing so he can marry his rich white girlfriend? Nah. Bagger should have been buying him cartons of Luckies and quarts of cheap gin. The guy looked like he was having a better time in the dumps.Avoid this mess.",4,2,3,25 January 2003
Antz," Animated Film That Will Entertain Adults
","From what I have read, DreamWorks got the idea of an insect animation film from Disney, rushed to market before the Disney version was released, and that they think this will enable them to compete against Disney in the animated film market?  I think some reevaluation is in order.ANTZ is not bad, far from it.  The animation is very well done (to this untrained, unschooled eye) and the voices well-acted (and maybe Woody wasn't so much acting as being Woody).  The feel-good plot was well......very Disney.  Certainly worth the price of a rental.  And I mean this for adults. I can't comment of the movie being too dark and violent for small children, well maybe very small children.  Nothing earth-shaking or leading edge, but good ol' entertainment.",8,14,21,12 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Weak Entry in the Star Wars Saga
","I gave 'Episode 1' a pass when it was first released in 1999. All the hype and hoopla surrounding the release was a real turn-off.  I couldn't understand the people that were paying full fare theater admission, not to see the feature, but solely to view the 'Episode 1' trailer. As the actual release approached people began queuing for tickets weeks in advance, and bidding up the admission cost to hundreds of dollars per seat. I found it all obscene, and I boycotted the movie. I did follow the reviews and was heartened when it was reviewed poorly, but then disheartened when it still made another fortune for Lucas.Now three years later, I've decided to see 'Episode Two' before it leaves the theaters. But I can't do that until I view 'Episode 1' to get straight with the plot elements. So, I rented 'Episode 1'. . .I couldn't believe my eyes. It's even worse than I hoped. Actually, it's not bad at all, and is rather entertaining. But when compared against the original three Star Wars movies, it doesn't hold a candle. Nothing in 'Episode 1' is original, it's all been done before in the earlier trilogy, and done much, much better. It's like a Star Wars movie, only drained of drama, suspense and originality.  What's left is a slick, high-tech, science fiction 'kids' movie. That's all.",6,2,4,5 November 2002
Catch Me If You Can," A Treat from Spielberg
","The plot is so preposterous it has to be true. A young man, a teenager actually, drops out of high school and, not satisfied with low-end jobs, variously impersonates an airline pilot, physician, and lawyer. All his impersonations work, and he uses his personas in various forgery schemes that net him millions of dollars that fuel his high-flying international life-style. The young man, Frank Abagnail, is played with breezy confidence by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is wonderfully believable and his portrayal of the young con man is one of his best roles.But it's not all entirely fun and games.  The relationship between Frank and his parents, especially his dearly beloved but down-on-his luck father (Christopher Walken) is sad and multi-layered. The third important personal dimension is between Frank and the FBI agent (Tom Hanks) who pursues him.Set in the early 60s, Spielberg nails the period perfectly from the opening credits through the clothing styles, modes of entertainment and transportation, and even personal accoutrements. It's perfection.  After a string of darker pictures it's heartening to see Spielberg take on this project. It's paid off very well for his fans and the movie going public.",9,1,2,1 June 2003
Minority Report," Excellent: A Science Fiction Murder Mystery
","What will life in the next generation be like? Or in two generations? 'Minority Report' answers that question, at least through the mind of Phillip K. Dick via Steven Spielberg. 'Minority Report' is a murder mystery set in the Washington, DC of 2054. But murder ain't what it used to be, or at least homicide detectives aren't what they used to be. In 2054, thanks to genetic engineering gone sour, three humans have precognitive powers, allowing them to predict murders before they happen with 100% accuracy. Well, not always 100%, sometimes its only 66.66%, when one of the PreCogs disagrees and files a 'minority report'. Tom Cruise plays Detective Anderton, head of the Pre-Crime Unit that oversees this operation, until that fateful day when the PreCogs finger him as a future murderer. So, he runs for it. Minority Report is at its heart a whodunit. The science fiction, outside of the PreCogs, is just a part of the scenery. Passive retinal scans constantly monitor citizen movements and are used to tailor a deluge of personal advertising. Highways have gone vertical. Police use personal jet packs. Spielberg's vision of the future is not as dark as 'Blade Runner', but it's still not very appealing.But the movie is great stuff. Spielberg has crafted the thinking man's science fiction. There's little to criticize in 'Minority Report', and it is highly recommended.",9,0,0,2 November 2002
Erin Brockovich," Good Movie but Overhyped ***Spoilers***
","'Erin Brokovich' is a slick, big budget, A-List movie starring Julia Roberts. But it's not your typical Julia Roberts vehicle, in other words, it's not a romantic comedy. 'Erin Brokovich' is a docu-drama, the material seemingly more attuned to an HBO made-for-TV movie than a weekend opener. But in the hands of Steven Soderberg, a very watchable movie is the result. Very watchable, but in my opinion, not deserving all the Oscar attention it got in 2001.My gripe is two-fold. First, there is no real drama, no tension. Everything the heroine attempts works out great. Finds a job, finds an understanding boyfriend, gets the bad guys, gets rich. Maybe that's how it went down in real life, but it's not very dramatic (or comedic).Secondly, even though this is not a romantic comedy it is still very much a Julia Roberts flick. Her smile and body (especially her breasts) are on constant display. This flick is her show through and through and everyone else is just a prop. So, does this make it a bad movie? No, it's a very good movie, just over-hyped and over rewarded.",8,0,1,21 January 2003
Meet the Parents," Not Very Funny
","'Meet the Parents' marries two actors, Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller, fresh off hysterical comic films, 'Analyze This' and 'There's Something About Mary' respectfully. Each is reprising the type of role they had in the previous film. One would think that 'Meet the Parents' should be a sidesplitting romp. Right? Wrong. Unlike their previous two films, 'Meet the Parents' seems forced and contrived. Sure there are some laughs, but there is little humanity in this outing, it's more a cold fish. I found I didn't like either Stiller's or De Niro's characters. And the chemistry between any of the characters is missing. Therefore, for me, the jokes weren't funny, and were often disturbing. Yeah, I know most critics liked 'Meet the Parents' and it made tons of money, it's just that I don't understand why.",6,1,2,7 October 2001
Unbreakable," A Disappointment
","Of the M. Night Shyamalan 'trilogy' (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) I found Shyamalan's take on the ghost story, The Sixth Sense, and his take on alien invasion, Signs, both excellent and entertaining movies. Shyamalan selects a tried-and-true topic and approaches it from a completely new angle infusing the story with a new freshness. I'd missed his film on comic book superheroes, Unbreakable, and anticipated my rental of it with relish. I shouldn't have. Shyamalan tries the same approach in Unbreakable, but with me it didn't ring true.  I'm not sure why. He had me believing in ghosts, and that there are aliens in the cornfield, but he didn't even come close to having me believe in superheroes. Bruce Willis, a grown man, living all his life and never suspecting that he has tremendous powers?  I never suspended belief and bought in to the story. I remained a skeptic throughout and by the astonishingly poor ending was ready to hit rewind.",5,1,2,4 July 2003
Fight Club," A Real Downer
","David Fincher's 'Fight Club' is a disturbing film, but being a David Fincher film, you expect it be. In a nutshell, Edward Norton plays a twenty-something white-collar guy drowning in the humdrum shallowness of yuppie life. Enter free spirit Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who is the opposite of the Edward Norton character, and knows how to turn his life around. Together they create a club of like-minded males who meet in fetid barroom basements and conduct savage bare-knuckle fights just for the fun of it.  It addicts them to violence; soon their lives revolve around the club. It's not just them, there are young men everywhere locked into low-pay dead-end jobs for whom smashing faces is just the antidote.  The club spreads like wildfire and begins to take on fascistic military overtones. And then there's a plot twist that will blow your mind. Sadly, two major flaws seriously drag down what should have been an excellent film. First, the amazing plot twist at the end of the movie (on par with that in 'The Sixth Sense') doesn't seem to have the serious adherence to it's rules that the plot twist in 'The Sixth Sense' had. (I must admit I've only watched the movie once). The other is that the fascistic, nihilistic, and misogyny of the film is actually celebrated, not ridiculed as many advocates of this movie assert. This disturbs me a lot, especially when you remember that IMDb reviewers rank it #40 on the all time favorites list. That's a bummer.",8,1,4,20 January 2001
Akira," Like a roller-coaster, thrilling but not going anywhere
",The first hour or so is very entertaining if you put your brain on hold and don't try to think much about the plot...stunning animation.But then you can't hold back...and start trying to make sense of what you are experiencing...and you can't figure it out.  The same scenes are whipping by except the carnage grows (and you care less) .... by the final half hour it's one colorful blur ... what's going on?  I'm bored...something's gotta happen...it's all going to be explained....oh never mind.If you want a good animation feature rent The Little Mermaid.,5,11,21,24 January 1999
Memento," Whoa!
","'Memento' is one of the more innovatively crafted movies I've seen. For starters, the story is told in reverse, the final scene of the story shown first, each scene following in reverse order. Therefore while the opening credits unfurl, you know the end result of the story. The remainder of the movie is the 'why' it occurred. This is intriguing in that previously viewed scenes become clearer and more understandable as earlier events are shown. The viewer's point of reference is constantly ping-ponging between the current scene and those he's viewed earlier. And the plot is also very odd. It's basically a revenge story for a savage crime in which the protagonist is injured and suffers a rare form of amnesia. He can remember everything up to the crime, and from that point on, can only remember events that have occurred in the immediate 15 minutes, i.e., he has no long term memory. This makes day-to-day activities very tough, and his solutions for dealing with his infirmary are memorable.If this isn't enough, 'Memento' is a puzzle-movie in the sprit of 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Fight Club'. After all is said and done, the final scenes (actually earliest scenes) obviate most of the assumptions you've collected. Everything is tossed on its head. I had to visit a 'Memento' web site where the movie is pieced together for the confused viewer. 'Memento' is a unique movie, a definite one-of-a-kind, and is highly recommended.",9,0,2,26 May 2003
Amistad," Wonderful Historic Drama Lacks Punch
","What a great story, and its true!  Newly captured slaves violently commandeer their slave ship and force the surviving crew to return them to Africa, but are tricked into landing in New England instead.  It's 1839 and the US is slowly sliding into Civil War.  The trial of the slave mutineers galvinizes the politicians, Abolitionists, and of course the lawyers.Spielberg collects a great cast of actors, most notably Anthony Hopkins as an aging John Quincy Adams, and Mathew McConaughy as the African's lawyer. The painstaking attention to historical detail transports the viewer back to this time, when America had one last chance to escape the nightmare of the Civil War, and was blowing it.Then why does the movie lack punch, and why was I so aware of the long length of the movie?  I can't really say actually.  The mutiny scene that opens the movie jolts and pulls you head first into the story.  But then the movie hits the breaks, and slows through recreations of the three trials to which the Africans were subjected.  The plodding pace loosens the films grip established so well in the beginning, and in only a few scenes, one of them being Hopkins summation to the Supreme Court at the end of the film, does it regain its dramatic punch.Still a very good movie, but one expects more from Mr. Spielberg.",8,1,3,11 July 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Excellent Romantic Comedy
","Romantic comedy has to be the most difficult type of film to make, at least to this middle-aged guy. So many are such groaners that when one is so well done as this one, well, you are very impressed. My only complaint are the witty contemporary in-jokes sprinkled throughout the film, tainting the broad, timeless human comedy with 'humor' that may be out-of-date (and unfunny) ten years hence. You know what I mean; Will's coffee mug, the 'analyst', the boatman wanting his script read, etc.  For shame, to me they soiled what should have been a perfect film. Nonetheless, it almost is.",9,0,1,12 March 2000
Alien: Resurrection," What a Mess
","If Alien3 didn't convince you that the franchise was finished Alien Resurrection sure will.  Set 200 years in the future after Ripley destroys herself to save humanity (in Alien3) she is brought back to life, cloned from a surviving sample of her blood.  But it's not just her genes but a mixture that includes alien genetic material.  She still looks human but is not, now she can play a killer game of basketball.  Stripped of her humanity Ripley fails to pack the dramatic punch that was so much a critical element of the earlier Alien movies.  And the aliens, well, they are now just another part of the cast, ho-hum.  The plot, and other characters are cartoonish and stereotypical.  What a waste of acting talent!  And the grand finale is so bad as to be laughable. My advice is to avoid this movie.",3,1,3,30 July 1999
Seven Years in Tibet," Passable - Good Scenery
","This biographical movie is about real-life Austrian (and Nazi) mountaineer Heinrich Harrar (Pitt) who is unfortunately scaling peaks in British India when WWII breaks out in 1939.  Interred in a British POW camp he and his climbing companion (Thewlis) eventually escape and commence a tortuous travail through India into Tibet and all the way to the forbidden city of Lhasa.  There the two men make friends, including the young Dali Lama, and find enlightenment.The best thing about Seven Years in Tibet is the breathtaking high mountain scenery.  How disappointing to learn the movie was shot in the Andes and not the Himalayas.  The story is also compelling following Harrar as he morphs from selfish pig to generally nice guy.  Unfortunately it's sometimes awkwardly told, and is over-long.  And finally the use of English language dialogue as variously English, German, and Tibetan was as off-putting as Pitt's on-again, off-again German accent.All in all a very ok film, not rip-off from the dollar bin.",7,6,9,31 January 2000
12 Monkeys," Thought-Provoking and Well-Acted
","********Spoilers********************'Twelve Monkeys' weaves a fascinating story about fate and destiny using the time-travel paradigm, 'can we change the present from the past?' Made in 1995, 'Twelve Monkeys' is set in the near future after a virus, maliciously released into the world by enviro-terrorists, has killed 99% of the human race. The remaining 1% exist underground in a police state, trying to develop a cure to the plague lurking on the surface. Interestingly, they've made a breakthrough in time travel and send 'volunteers' into the past to try and retrieve a sample of the pure, un-mutated plague virus that can be used to fashion a cure.  Cool, huh? You bet.Bruce Willis is a volunteer, and in his first time-trip the scientists miss the mark, placing him four years before the outbreak. Naked, uncivilized, and talking nonsense Bruce is quickly placed in a mental institution where he meets Jeffrey Goines played by Brad Pitt. Goines is the wealthy scion who will soon found the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, the environmental group that unleashes the plague. The story is one of those mind-twisting psychological adventures that are so popular these days. But it doesn't have the 'look-at-me' smugness that hampers many efforts. The story is told in a straightforward, albeit dark, cinematic style. This is Terry Gilliam remember. Willis and Pitt give excellent performances and they alone are worth the price of the rental. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it, especially if you're a science fiction fan.",8,1,2,23 March 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Doesn't Make It As A Feature Length Movie
","I usually don't watch the television show, but on the occasions that I do, more often than not it'll leave me in stitches. So, I had high hopes for the movie, but sadly, they weren't realized. Maybe I waited too long after its release to view it, and had heard too many of the punchlines around the water cooler. It seems that the cartoonists had the material for a 22 minute episode, maybe even two, but a feature-length movie? Nope, but they still tried to stretch it out, and it didn't work.  Additionally, the humor is getting threadbare and is aging poorly. All in all, this movie was a disappointment.",5,0,3,15 July 2002
Elizabeth," Good Historical Drama
","The opening scene is dark and horrific, and sets the tone for the remaining story.  That story is a behind-the-scenes look at the English monarchy during the final days of the Catholic and childless Queen Mary, and the ascendancy of the Protestant and unmarried Elizabeth.Dark and brooding with deep colors, smoke and shadow, Elizabeth is not a light Renaissance romp.  Bodies do pile up, and cross and double-cross abound as Elizabeth gropes her way to power. And that's about it as far as the story goes...Queen Mary's dying, the Earl of Norfolk and his friends try to kill Elizabeth and fail, Mary dies and Elizabeth becomes queen, Norfolk and friends try again and fail again, then its payback time for Elizabeth.One of my few complaints about the movie is the lack of character development outside of Elizabeth.  The motivations of the surrounding characters is only superficially addressed.  The movie's success rests on two pillars, Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting, and the beautiful cinematography and sets.  Blanchett (and Geoffrey Rush) carry the acting chores, and they are remarkable.  The remainder seem to go a little overboard, like they're doing a 1550s England bit for MTV.The movie certainly entertains and makes for a good viewing.  My only regret is that I saw it on the small screen, and wished I'd seen it in a theater.",8,0,0,19 June 1999
Billy Elliot," Effective
","'Billy Eliott', as everyone knows, is a straightforward, feel-good movie. It can be thought of as a cross between 'Breaking Away' (young working class kids overcoming adversity for their love of sport) and 'The Full Monty' (the working class is English). Personally, I like this type of film. If it works, you are inspired and leave the theater with a tear in the eye. If they fail, they're a hoot.  'Billy Eliott' is one that works. You root for young Billy: to overcome the disapproval of his family and neighbors, to rise above the poverty, and to succeed and dance his way into the hearts of a grateful England. Okay, maybe not like that. 'Billy Eliott' also has some depth; central characters are more thoroughly drawn. The father who is torn between his deep love for his son, and his visceral dislike of his young son's desire to be a dancer.  He's also involved in a lengthy and bitter labor strike that leaves the family strapped for cash. And there is the older brother following in the father's footsteps, and the elderly grandmother with dementia. It's not a great film, but a very effective film. You can't go wrong for a 'good for the whole family' rental.",8,0,1,15 May 2002
The Mummy," Indiana Jones, Jr.
","The Mummy has more in common with Indiana Jones than the old Universal mummy movies of the 30s and 40s.  This Mummy is also extremely formulaic and not that well scripted.  It doesn't have the depth of characters, the thrills and chills, and story complexity of the Indiana Jones movies.  It goes overboard with CGI.  Still, it is very likable and it worked for me.  What more can I say?.....it made a bundle?",7,0,0,5 November 1999
Chicken Run," Fun for All Ages
","'Chicken Run' represents the height of stop-motion animation. It's amazing stuff, and considering the amount of labor that goes into making stop-motion features, I stand in awe. And 'Chicken Run' is not just for kids and geeks. Adults as well as kids will enjoy the story, a suspenseful account of the repeated attempts by a barnyard of chickens to escape their coops before they are processed into chicken pies. They're led by a plucky young chicken, and aided by a rooster on the lam from the circus. Not deep, but the drama as well as the humor is skillfully maintained throughout. Disney would approve. For a family-oriented Saturday night rental 'Chicken Run' hits the mark.",8,1,2,8 December 2001
Insomnia," Excellent Performances, Especially Williams
","One doesn't expect to feel claustrophobic in Alaska, but that's exactly the effect when watching 'Insomnia'. The primary story is about the police investigation of the murder of a high-school girl in a small Alaskan town. Through the pull of old acquaintances and political necessity, two LA homicide detectives (Pacino and Martin Donovan) are dispatched to the scene to help the locals. The political necessity concerns a graft investigation in which the two LA detectives are key suspects. One is thinking of copping a plea, so they are spirited out of LA to avoid the investigative light. Then they find themselves in the 24-hour day of the Alaskan summer where the two plot lines collide; the murder investigation and the graft. And what a collision it is. The insomnia of the title is suffered by the Pacino character, who can't sleep during the movie's 7-day span. And each day his eyes are more sunken, he's groggier, less focused. This parallels his descent into guilt, remorse, and desperation. But to provide any more details would be to give away key plot elements. 'Insomnia' is gripping and it's best to see the movie cold.The acting, especially Robin Williams as the key suspect in the child slaying, is top notch. Williams is made for these roles, he should kiss the suck-up feel-good stuff goodbye for good. The photography is excellent, Alaska never looked so ominous, and the direction delivers the goods. Highly recommended.",8,104,121,19 September 2002
X-Men," Very Good Fantasy Film
","I've never been an X-Men comic book reader, but I did know that the X-Men were a large collection of mutants with a wide array of super powers. Some worked for the forces of good, some evil. So, when I heard that this stew had been made into a movie my first thought was that this would be a mess. I could imagine the moviemakers wandering all over the map without focus, making a real hash of things. What a surprise when the movie proved my fears groundless. What could have happened (an unfocused mess) didn't happen, and the chief thanks belongs with the screenplay; it made the movie.  It's tight, well crafted, and focused. It's not played for camp, but straight up. With lots of help from a talented cast, and direction, 'X-Men' makes for a very entertaining fantasy film. I recommend it highly when fx-supported escapism is needed.",8,0,0,3 February 2001
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton on His Game
","Love that Tim Burton. In 'Sleepy Hollow', he has taken the Washington Irving novella and rewritten it for the screen. Irving fans find this a sacrilege, but the story is not nearly as important as the storytelling. This is a Burton film remember, and the sets, lighting, costumes, and props all create an incredible visual, almost palpable environment. A Hudson Valley town circa 1800 via Gothic Mittel Europa. The visual atmosphere is cinematic perfection. This alone is worth the price or a ticket or rental. And the acting; Depp and Burton work very well together and this is no exception. Depp's Ichobod Crane, now a forensics detective instead of a schoolteacher, is just the right mixture of satire, false bravado, and fear. Christina Ricci is sexy and mysterious as his love interest/adversary. And an unbilled Christopher Walken, as the Headless Horseman, takes his role to the top, but not over. I won't go into the plotting, except to say that outside of the title, locale, and the Headless Horseman, little is recognizable from the original story. But who cares? 'Sleepy Hollow' is Burton at this best, and is well worth a visit.",8,0,1,22 June 2002
We Were Soldiers," Grim War Movie - This Time 'Nam
","Continuing a trend in war movies; that of using state-of-the-art special effects to recreate the carnage of battle, Hollywood has now provided us its first entry for the Vietnam War. This follows World War II (Saving Private Ryan) and the Somali conflict (Black Hawk Down). Like 'Black Hawk Down', 'We Were Soldiers' is based on fact, written by the American commander of the famous November 1965 battle that heralded the start of large-scale American combat participation in the war. Thankfully, the filmmakers spend more time developing the film's major characters than did Ridley Scott in 'Black Hawk Down' (which was my only complaint of that excellent movie). The difficult lives of the soldier's spouses are dramatically (and theatrically) portrayed to excellent effect. Over half the movie is reserved for the actual battle, and it's a grim and gory affair. We care for the soldiers, their wives, and families, and when the battle starts and the blood begins to spill, we, the viewers, are emotionally pulled apart. This is a very straightforward film, the portrayal of a single large battle, and its effect on the combatants and their families. I highly recommend it, but if you are uncomfortable with on-screen carnage, you'll want to avoid it.",8,1,2,11 December 2002
The Beach," Make Up Your Mind
","On the surface, 'The Beach' holds so much promise: a proven director and his crew, seasoned young actors, interesting story, and beautiful location. But the direction wanders among multiple themes, never settling on a single vision. This pulls the film down, and the actors are unable to save it. Nonetheless, its not a total waste, just a wasted opportunity.",6,1,3,28 July 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Not a Bad Flick
","Check out the list of movies I've reviewed and you'll see a preponderance of romances and romantic comedies. Does the initial 'g' in my name stand for Gloria or Gwen? No, it stands for 'married'. And one of those agreements one makes with one's partner, was that she should select 50% of the movies we watch together. I guess I shouldn't complain, she wanted to pick them all...but I'm a tough negotiator.  Anyway, I've seen my share of these kinds of films and am becoming something of a connoisseur. 'Bridget Jones's Diary' is one of the better offerings in the genre. The characters are more realistic, and I could relate to them: underemployed, drinking too much, horny and on the prowl, with screwed-up families. This is a British movie, and I thought 'Hey, they ARE just like us Americans'.   'Bridget Jones's Diary' is not the best movie released in 2002, the story is hardly original. But the dialogue, London setting, and the actors make this romantic comedy worth sharing with your significant other when it's their turn to pick.",7,0,0,5 March 2003
The Bourne Identity," What a Spy Movie Should Be Like These Days
","James Bond and Ethan Hunt take notice. 'The Bourne Identity' is my new standard for contemporary spy thrillers.  Gone (or almost gone) are the special effects that James and Ethan rely on all too heavily. Hell, in those franchises the special effects have virtually replaced story and characters. 'The Bourne Identity' has a very straightforward story to tell, a mystery that slowly unravels. Spycraft is not all about technical gizmos, but requires human brains and human brawn (and a fair amount of gunplay and car chases). Set in various locales in Switzerland and France during the winter much of the visuals for 'The Bourne Identity' are gray and damp. That's a plus, Monte Carlo and like locales can get boring. Mat Damon is great as Jason Bourne, fished from the Mediterranean mostly dead by gunshot wounds. A total amnesiac, he slowly realizes that he possesses the deadly skills of a well-trained assassin, and that someone is out to kill him. Franka Potente is equally good as the young woman swept up in his life and forced to run with him. Run or be killed.I can't say enough good things about this movie. Doug Limon, thanks, you did a great job.",9,228,270,11 December 2002
The Italian Job," Good Movie, Great Soundtrack
","F. Gary Gray has created a very effective high-speed caper flick. Nothing too deep, just the basic elements delivered with style and flash. These elements include the members of the gang; the sage leader, his number one, the tactician, geek, and explosives guy. Then there's the initial big heist, betrayal and death, another theft that is bigger than the first, while not forgetting the obligatory chase scenes, other cliffhangers, and romance. The characters are portrayed by a well-rounded ensemble cast who usually resist chewing the scenery. The directing is competent and abetted by a great soundtrack. No overreaching by Mr. Gray, he delivers a straight, just-for-entertainment story, and does it very well.",8,1,2,25 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Simple Question
","3,000 people have commented on this movie, almost all just gushing away about its cinematic perfection. Yes, I agree the movie is excellent and will probably garner bundles of Oscars and make the studio heads as rich as Midas. I'd look to use my little space to raise a small, but troubling question about the film. Where is the sex? I'm not talking about graphic depictions, but the standard relationship between men and women (or hobbits, elves and orcs); You know; romantic love, a simple sexual tension, perhaps even a bit of carnality. It appears to me that for a full 3 Â½  hours, love, romance, and physical desire are virtually non-existent. The movie shows us the manufacture of Orcs, but what about everyone else? The hobbit-heads I've met almost universally disparage the Harry Potter books and film as 'for children' whereas Tolkien's trilogy and Jackson's film are 'for adults'. Think again.",9,1,2,23 March 2002
Cast Away," Religious Overtones? *******Spoilers'*******
","I was surprised by the number of religious themes in 'Cast Away'. I should have suspected though, it's the story of a hard-charging yuppie go-getter who, because of a plane crash, is stranded alone on a tiny Pacific Ocean island. There he is forced to live by his wits, and keep his sanity while he waits for deliverance. Knowing these story elements I was expecting to be bored to tears. The only reason for renting it was to see Tom Hank's performance. But no, I was not bored at all. The first quarter of the movie introduces us to Tom, his fiancée, and job as a FedEx troubleshooter. He's a nice guy, but something's missing. The fateful flight over the Pacific fills us with dread, and by the time the plane gets lost, we're on the edge of our seats. The middle half of the movie covers his castaway years on a tropical island, and how he learns to cope both physically and mentally. The final quarter of the film chronicles his escape and return to civilization. Religious symbols and themes are all over 'Cast Away', from the blatant (the angel wings on the only FedEx box Tom never opens) to the more subtle, (the cave iconography, and the meaning of the hangman's rope).  'Cast Away' is more than just a storytelling movie, there's lots to think about also. I highly recommend it for a family rental.",9,0,0,8 November 2002
Armageddon," Reeaaaallllly suspend belief, then it's cool.
","While surfing IMDb for Armegeddon I poked into 'goofs' expecting to see 'total suspension of Newtonian physics'. For exaample, in the start of the movie three asteroids hit Earth. Statistically the hits should be hit one Pacific Ocean, hit two Pacific Ocean, hit three Pacific Ocean, but noooo....hit one Manhattan, hit two Shanghai, and hit three Paris.You gotta love Jerry Bruckheimer and friends. They always deliver, and Armegeddon is no exception...but you gotta suspend belief (or disbelief) first, then it's OK. Off to Jerryland to be entertained. That's why you go to the movies or rent videos, right? If you want a Physics lesson go to school.",8,1,1,10 January 1999
American Psycho," Great Acting, Graphically Violent, Near Miss Overall
","'American Psycho' is purportedly a satire of the 1980s Wall Street culture of greed, but sadly, I don't understand what is being satirized. The characters seem cartoonish, and impossibly venal and corrupted. Is this really the culture of America's big investment banks and its running dogs? After this year's corporate scandals, maybe 'American Psycho' would be an improvement.Politics and sociology aside, 'American Psycho' is an uneven film. The acting is superb and Christian Bale's portrayal of the sociopathic young banker, Patrick Bateman, drips cold menace even while ordering dinner. The first two-thirds of the movie are very effective, walking a narrow line between horror and satire. But during the final third, the film changes direction, loses focus, and doesn't finish well. I'm conflicted whether to recommend this movie. The film is graphically violent and misogynistic (and as a consequence, disturbing). If you can handle rough films, you might give it a try. But in my opinion, 'American Psycho' is a near miss.",7,0,1,3 September 2002
U-571," Standard (War)fare
","There's nothing new on offer in 'U-571', the story about Allied attempts to capture German U-boats and their prized Enigma code machines. When a U-boat is crippled in the North Atlantic, an operation is quickly mounted in which an American sub is camouflaged as German to get close enough to send aboard a rescue crew which will then overpower the Nazis. No problema. 
There is also the personal conflict where the second in command (McConnaughey) has just been denied promotion by the commander (Paxton). Most of the other characters are not very well developed (stereotyped) like the standard war movies of past decades. And the action sequences are predictable. 'U-571' was nominated for lots of sound-related awards, but this is lost on standard television systems like mine. If this is the way you intend to view 'U-571', don't. For the home theater owners, if the sound of rivets popping on sub bulkheads is your cup of tea, this is supposed to be the best.",6,0,1,9 March 2003
American Beauty," It's Tops
","What's not to like about this movie? The story explores how modern civilization can sap human joy and happiness, but avoids the violence and banality many of these cinematic journeys take. It finds emotional richness in suburban 1990s America, and with subtlety and deftness delivers it up in a fine, carefully woven story. And the skills displayed by director, actors, sound, and camera...top notch all the way down the line. It truly deserved the Academy Award for best picture, 1999. If you haven't seen this movie, do so.",10,0,0,12 November 2000
BASEketball," Zucker Comedy Schtick Getting Stale
","In making Airplane and Naked Gun the Zuckers brought a fresh, novel approach to comedy that fit the times well.  These movies skewered the status quo with a full frontal assault on the popular culture.  Their brand of potty humor hadn't been seen before and it was a great guilty pleasure to watch. BASEketball tries to plow the same old ground but turns up nothing new and original.  It's all been done before and done much better.  It's amazing the Zuckers could not see this.  There are a few laughs, but only a few.",4,3,11,1 January 2000
Apocalypse Now," One of the Greats
","Which is better? The original cut, or 'Redux'? My theatrical/literary timeline for this saga is as follows. I saw 'Apocalypse Now' when it was released theatrically in 1979, and I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen. Then some years later I read 'Heart of Darkness' on which 'Apocalypse Now' is based. It's not an easy book; short, but a tough pull. After reading the novel, I disagreed about the movie's supposed close relationship to the novel and felt the two had less in common than many reviewers claimed. I had the distinct feeling that the closest some of these columnists had come to the 'Heart of Darkness' was the Classic Comic. Then, many years later, I watched 'Redux'.  The editing and additional scenes make 'Redux' less a war movie than the original, and textually closer to the 'Heart of Darkness' with its slow trip up the dark, tropical river. The better film? The original is tighter and tells a better story. If you've seen neither, this is the one. But if you've seen the original and loved it, rent 'Redux'. You'll be pleased.",10,1,1,3 March 2003
The Patriot," Braveheart It Ain't
","If the viewer expects 'Braveheart' relocated to Colonial America, think again. This is not directed by Mel Gibson, but is brought to you by the duo of Emmerich and Devlin whose earlier work includes 'Godzilla' and 'Independence Day'. And in 'The Patriot' they show a similar disregard for American history as they did for logic and the laws of physics in their science fiction films. Surprisingly it was written by the screenwriter who wrote 'Saving Private Ryan'. But now he slathers mounds of Political Correctness on already inane dialogue. And the rest of the story is pure clichÃ©, from the utterly contemptible British villains to the perfection of the (slave owning) Americans. They should have let Gibson write and direct it. As it is, it's pretty mediocre stuff. Unfortunately, historical dramas set during the Revolutionary Period are few and far between. If you're looking for a good one, this does not increase that number.",5,0,2,29 May 2003
Being John Malkovich," Incredibly Original
","'Being John Malkovich' is the most inventive, original movie of the year, if not the decade. Through the entire movie, just as you think you have it figured out (or are feeling comfortable with the plot), the filmmaker throws you another well-placed curve. The movie's originality never lets up from start to finish. Besides the writing and directing the acting is also top notch, certainly deserving more Oscars than it got.  If you haven't seen 'Being John Malkovich', do so.",9,1,2,21 December 2000
Spider-Man," This Blockbuster Deserves It
","What can one say about 'Spider-Man', the summer of 2002's big summer blockbuster? It deserves it, sure, but what makes it special?The special effects? They're fantastic, but by 2002 any A-List, Big Opening Weekend movie better nail the cool effects, Hell, even mediocre movies are doing a damn good job at this nowadays.No, I felt three things set Spider-Man apart. First was the casting. Tobey Maguire was perfect for Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe never climbed over the top with his Norman Osborne aka Green Goblin role. Kirsten Dunst as the love interest, James Franco as the rival, and Cliff Robertson as Parker's grandfather; all excellent choices who deliver the goods.  Second was the dark edge to the story, reminiscent of the two Tim Burton Batman movies. Not everything is perfect in this comic book, good people die, and good deeds are not always rewarded. I like this. And lastly, and related to the dark edge, is the end of the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, but the movie has a very satisfying although not entirely happy ending, which leaves the door wide open for the sequel.",9,0,1,13 November 2002
American History X," Powerful Stuff
","American History X follows the first 24-hours of freedom of a reformed neo-Nazi skinhead (Norton) in Los Angeles after serving 3-years for a brutal crime.  Most of the film is flashback (in black and white) illustrating the progression of a relatively normal working class kid from average joe to a virulent hate-filled racist, and how 3 years at Chino causes a spiritual awakening and repudiation of his past.American History X is kept from being a great movie by its preachiness, and a failure to resolve and/or explain some of its  sub-plots and currents.American History X is a powerful film with large doses of physical and emotional violence, and it definately deserves its R rating.  It is a must rental for those adults not easily offended.  B+",9,0,0,30 May 1999
Legends of the Fall," Beautiful Scenery, Badly Chewed Up (***Spoilers***)
","In the years just prior to WWI Colonel Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) retires from the Army in protest to their treatment of Native Americans, and settles his family deep in the Montana Rockies. His Eastern-bred wife can't adapt and quickly departs leaving a family dynamic right out of the TV show, 'Bonanza'. The patriarch aided by his three adult sons and assorted ranch hands, living the good life in splendid isolation. The oldest son (Aidan Quinn) is stolid, modern and business-like, the middle son (Brad Pitt) lives in close spiritual kinship with elements of the disappearing frontier, and the youngest son (Henry Thomas) is, of course, the family idealist. The family idyll is routinely disrupted by trouble, first by the arrival of the youngest son's betrothed (Julia Ormond), with whom the other two sons fall in love, then by the outbreak of WWI (all three sons volunteer for combat via Canada). And this is just for starters; the bad things inflicted on the family are right out of a Thomas Hardy novel; accidents, murder, suicide, racial conflict, and political corruption. 'Legends of the Fall' is a cinematic epic; big scenery, big events, and big characters. And for the most part, it succeeds in capturing the drama and pathos of this ranching family (and the West) on the cusp of the modern age. The film follows each member of the family, documenting their many travails over a span of 15 years, from 1913 through the late 1920s. It's good, but it also allows for some real scenery chewing by the actors, especially Hopkins. But who cares? Shot against some of the most beautiful scenery in the world and given the staggering events of the story, what else can one do?",7,10,16,20 October 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Another Spielberg Masterpiece
","I saw Saving Private Ryan with some trepidation.  I saw it late, and on the small screen.  I knew about the initial half-hour, and had read the criticisms of the film from the right and left of the political spectrum. It seems all the 'political' reviewers didn't like it, and I was prepared to be disappointed.   All I can say is 'wow!'.  Saving Private Ryan is one of the most gripping films I have ever seen.  Gripping in the sense that it grabs you and doesn't let go.  You belong to it for the almost 3 hour running time; you can't think of anything else, you can't leave.  This is a film you will be thinking about for days afterwards.  It is a must rent, a classic. But, if you have lived in a cave for the last two years and haven't heard, the film is highly graphic in its depictions of battle, and is not for the faint-hearted.",10,0,0,13 October 1999
The Pianist," Polanki's Masterpiece
","I generally would never recommend that a film be required viewing for all young people, but 'The Pianist' is not your everyday movie. It's a movie about the greatest crime in history, The Holocaust, told by two individuals who lived through it. It's based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish musician living with his family in Warsaw at the time of the Nazi invasion of Poland. The Szpilmans are Jewish and suffer the Nazi's monstrous designs for European Jewry.  The story's told in almost a matter-of-fact way. First there are the required identification markings for Jews, followed by restrictions of movement, limits on the ownership of money...slowly, one step at a time, leading to mass murder. And Wladyslaw Szpilman is there through it all, extraordinarily lucky, and blessed with great friends, so that he lives through all six years of Nazi occupation. An amazing story of human survival.The filmmaker, Roman Polanski, survived the Krakow ghetto as a child. With 'The Pianist', he has made his best movie, his masterpiece, surpassing even his previous greats, 'Chinatown' and 'Repulsion'. This is a great labor of love. It's perfectly filmed, the horror and humanity of the story hitting home like few movies, no, few works of art in any medium, can. If you haven't seen it, do so.",10,0,1,5 June 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Dazzling Fairy Tale
","Ang Lee's film about a mystical, medieval China with its master swordsmen, mysterious assassins, court intrigues, desert bandits, and true love is one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences of 2000. The staging, acting, direction, choreography all unite to bring life to what is essentially a Chinese fairy tale. Played straight up and serious without a smirk or wink (that no American filmmaker could probably resist given the subject), viewers are magically transported to this make believe world, completely satisfying one of the prime directives of filmmaking: to entertain.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Now They Fight a Big Battle
","Not as complex as 'The Fellowship of the Rings', the middle film of the Rings trilogy should be known as the 'battle' film. At least that's how it seemed to me. 'The Fellowship' laid the groundwork; introduced the main characters, the different species, and how they all interact, and now in 'The Two Towers' they get down to some serious fighting. I swear the major battle at the conclusion of the movie takes up its final hour. Not that I'm complaining, but I missed the social interactions and sub-plots of 'Fellowship'. The highlight of 'The Two Towers' is the arrival of Gollum, seen only for a brief second in 'Fellowship'.  This CGI guy steals the movie. And I have to feel some sympathy for the hapless Orcs, whose only purpose seems to be to die horrible deaths at the hands of anything that can fog a mirror. All in all though, for medieval-style fighting (with dragons, elves, dwarfs and the like) this movie can't be beat.",9,0,0,2 April 2003
Coyote Ugly," Ugly Indeed
","Jerry Bruckheimer movies are not intellectual endeavors; as we all know his clichéd scripting, 'wall of sound' soundtracks, and fast-cut action are mostly applied to slam-bang, kick-ass adventure movies. On the level of pure, mindless entertainment they usually work; they certainly make him and his team buckets of money. In 'Coyote Ugly' Jerry takes his style and applies it to the romance genre. It doesn't work.Yes, the production values are super slick, and the story, although unoriginal, holds promise. To digress, Violet (Piper Parabo), pizza joint songbird from New Jersey, pulls up stakes and heads for Manhattan to hit the big time. To pay her bills while launching her music career, she bartends at Coyote Ugly, a bar where the female bartenders dance, prance, and sing (all very suggestively) for a raucous male clientele. It's all very predictable from the stage fright, the romantic misunderstandings, the trouble at the barwill her career get launched, love find its way, the bar remain open? Need you ask?   Since we've plowed this ground many times before it's the 'getting there' that should provide the entertainment. But thanks to an incredibly bad script, getting there is an unintended laugher. At this level the film works, but if you want to take it seriously, I'm sorry, it fails.",4,0,1,7 June 2003

It?s more like, 'Is this movie a complete disaster, or did I love it?' I found 'Moulin Rouge!' one of the most innovative and enjoyable movies of the year. But it gave me a headache.  If Baz had slowed down the editing a couple of notches, so moviegoers could focus, he might have won more Oscars.",9,1,2,30 March 2002
Back to the Future Part III," Pleasant Closing to the Trilogy
","Back to the Future Part III was less confusing than Part II, but it also dispensed with most of the time travel paradoxes and mysteries that made the Parts I and II so intriguing.Set almost entirely in 1885 it picks up at the cliff-hanger ending of Part II with Doc Brown inadvertently sent to 1885, and Marty stuck in 1955.  The 1955 version of Doc Brown helps Marty return to 1885 to save Doc's life, and there the movie remains until the very end.I wish Part III had moved about in time more, and the 1885 version of Hill Valley not been so hokey, but I still heartily recommend Part III and the entire trilogy.  Part I is by far the best, and the only part that can be viewed by itself.  Don't try to view Parts II and III without viewing the precedent movies....if you do you will definitely be lost.",7,2,3,6 February 1999
La Grande Illusion," An Excellent, Much Copied Film
","Parts POW escape movie, parts anti-war movie, parts buddy movie, parts social commentary, 'The Grand Illusion' is a timeless gem. Released in 1937 the war in question is World War I, and the prisoners are French, their captors German. There are four main characters; three prisoners and the commandant of their camp. One prisoner and the commandant are aristocracy from the old, nineteenth century Europe, the Europe being destroyed around them by The Great War. Theirs is the grand illusion of the title. One of the remaining two is a member of the proletariat, the other a member of the newly rich bourgeoisie.  There are numerous famous scenes, copied in many movies in the years to come. There is also great acting, directing, and cinematography. 'Grand Illusion' is a classic, so don't let the 30s filming technology and the subtitles scare you off. You won't be disappointed.",9,1,2,2 April 2003
Pi," Confused Story
","'Pi', supposedly a quintessential indie film, is remarkable in that it proves that a decent film can be made for $60K. It is a technical and managerial achievement; 'Pi', is a real movie and it tells a story. But is it a good movie with a story worth telling (or at least sitting through)? For me, the answer is a very qualified yes. I felt the movie started out strong, and then seriously floundered in its final third. It got too artsy, lost it way, and kind of wandered towards the finish line. My advice is that if you are interested in low-budget, offbeat indie film, by all means rent 'Pi'. If you are just looking for an entertaining nights rental, give it a pass.",8,3,5,14 October 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Mr Woo Misfires
","'Mission: Impossible 2' is not in the same league with John Woo's previous 'Face/Off' or even the first installment of Mission Impossible.  It has all the glitz and glitter, A-list staff, and money to be a highly entertaining film. But it isn't. The story is simplistic, unoriginal, and has plot holes and dead-ends aplenty. The acting seems even more wooden that is allowable for the genre, and the characters are two-dimensional. For an action movie, it has way too many boring, snooze zones.  Well, I was slightly entertained while I watched it, but it is immanently forgettable. And that?s a shame.",6,3,6,23 May 2002
Black Hawk Down," Astonishing Realism
","A cinematic dramatization of the intense 18-hour gun battle in central Mogadishu between Army Rangers and Somali irregulars, 'Black Hawk Down' is a 120-minute roller coaster ride with bullets and grenades. Accurately following the terrible events in October 1992, director Ridley Scott seems to chronicle every gunshot and rocket as a band of Army Rangers tries to extricate themselves from deep inside enemy territory after a failed attempt to capture high-ranking associates of a local warlord.  The gun battle and rescue attempt encompass the final three-fourths of the movie. Its stunning realism is on par with the Omaha Beach opener to 'Saving Private Ryan'. But unlike 'Saving Private Ryan' that's all there is to 'Black Hawk Down'. The first quarter of the movie is not used judiciously to introduce the characters and we don't know them very well when the action starts. And after the bullets start to fly, that's it till the end of the movie. Don't get me wrong, 'Black Hawk Down' is a very good war movie, but if the first quarter had been better written, it could have been a great movie.",8,0,0,26 October 2002
Rudy," Wait a Minute Here....[Spoiler Alert]
","I love movies that glorify the positive side of human nature, especially those that use sports as a metaphor for the 'can do' spirit.  Modern examples are Rocky, Hoosiers, and Breaking Away.  Rudy is in this mold.Supposedly true, Rudy tells the story of a young working class guy who, after toiling for four years in the steel mills after high school, decides to play varsity football for the University of Notre Dame.  So what if he's small of stature and short on smarts.  Rudy, like the energizer bunny just keeps on going.The movie dramatizes his four year struggle to achieve his goals.  It's a charming story and my eyes watered during the final scene.  But as the last scene fades a final text says that no other player has been carried off the field at Notre Dame since Rudy in 1975.  (Sorry for the spoiler).  I do some quick math and realize that Rudy graduated from high school in 1968, the same year I did.  I know from experience that young men who didn't go directly to college were very likely to join a rifle company in 'Nam whether they wanted to or not.  You didn't go to the mills as it seems Rudy and all his brothers did.Rudy wastes virtually nothing on side plots.  His high school girlfriend, whom he almost marries, disappears completely after he leaves for South Bend.  I'm appreciative that the film-makers didn't clutter up the landscape with sub-plots and an annoying rock and roll sound track.  Thank you.  But the draft and the war in Vietnam overshadowed everything in 1968 especially for 18-year-olds.  For me it's like trying to ignore the elephant in the living room.I liked the movie, and recommend it highly, but I'm still stuck with the question.  If Rudy was healthy enough to be a human tackling dummy for the Notre Dame football team how'd he stay out of the Army?",8,1,2,24 April 1999
Quiz Show," A Gem of a Movie
","Small dramas, when well made, comprise some my favorite cinematic gems. Large spectaculars, flashy adventures, and spine-tingling thrillers are a major fare of movies, that's what film making technology does best. But the small dramas, well scripted, well acted, that focus on characters and dialogue, these are rare and worthwhile finds. 'Quiz Show' is such a movie. Robert Redford deftly tells the story of the 1950s TV quiz show scandal, in a way that lifts it well above simple docu-drama. Supported by tremendous acting this is one of the best movies of 1994, and is highly recommended.",9,1,2,28 April 2002

Most everyone knows this very popular and honored film, so I won't belabor the story. Briefly, in my humble opinion, this film deserves all the accolades it's been awarded. A near perfect film, my only gripe is that Mr. Benigni's performance could have been more understated, especially the half of the film that's set in the concentration camp. But this is only a slight complaint. For a joyful, life-affirming movie, Life Is Beautiful is tops. But be forewarned, as its principal backdrop of anti-Semitism and Nazi murder, it is not a very happy movie.",9,95,144,12 November 2000

Eyes Wide Shut," Poor Showing for Kubrick (Spoiler)
","Had 'Eyes Wide Shut' been released as a companion piece to 'A Clockwork Orange', Kubrick might have been able to connect with his audience. In the early '70s, a cinematic 'pushing the envelope' was an end in itself; the story vehicle was often secondary. You just had to push. And at that point in time, 'Eyes Wide Shut' would have been doing just that, challenging the audience with a new type of film, new ideas. By 2000, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is pushing nothing and telling its story poorly.  It's a challenge to keep your eyes open.One problem is that of motivation, both on the character's part and that of the director. For example, why does the Nicole Kidman character confess of an affair she might have had, but didn't? Out of the blue to her stoned husband? The characters just don't act logically. And for Mr. Kubrick, why does he shoot what he does?  Why does he think that watching Ms. Kidman wipe herself adds to the story? Weird.And the story's high point...rich New Yorkers holding super-secret dress-up soirées to screw whores. I don't think so. As a long-term ex-pat in Europe Mr. Kubrick must have gotten confused...and should have set the story in Brussels.Bottom line: watch 'Paths of Glory' for a fifth time instead.",5,3,5,24 April 2001

That's great for kids and the studios, but what about adults? Actually, there's not very much at offer. Chris Columbus and Ms Rowling seem stretched pretty thin story-wise in this first installment of Harry Potter. Quidditch? The chess game? Learning to ride a broomstick? Big Deal. It doesn't seem new and not even on par with a Star Trek installment. It more resembles Disney's early 60s efforts like Herbie the Love Bug. Ok, so Harry's supposed to be in about the fifth grade or so. When he ages will the stories get more mature also? No, they won't. Four, five, six more Harry Potter films?

When I first saw it, it took me by complete surprise (c'mon, it's a Keanu Reeves movie), and it provided one of my more enjoyable movie-going experiences in 1999.  Like all great science fiction, it brought a new, terrifying, and wildly believable world to life.  All I could say was 'wow'. When I heard that this was only the first of a trilogy of Matrix movies, I had more than a little trepidation. How could the Wachowskis jump-start the second while improving upon the original? Well, the answer is, they couldn't. The second installment, The Matrix Reloaded, doesn't hold a candle to the original. But all of the principals from the first are present; what went wrong? Well it's the Star Wars Syndrome. But at least George Lucas gave us three great movies before stumbling, the Wachowski's mustered only one. But the mistakes committed by Lucas and the Wachowskis are very similar; infusions of moralizing, diminuation and sanitizing of the drama and tragedy, dumbing down the characters, etc, etc. The Matrix Reloaded is not a bad movie, just a disappointing one.",7,0,1,3 February 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Deserves Its Accolades
","Who could guess that an extraordinarily entertaining mainstream movie could be made about a schizophrenic mathematician? I couldn't, but I'm not Ron Howard, who has done just that. This film also proves that Russell Crowe is not just another pretty face, but a major acting talent. Ditto for Jennifer Connelly. And on and on. My bottom line is that if you have not yet seen this movie, and like myself, believed the subject matter could not be made entertaining, you are wrong. Make this your next film.",9,0,2,28 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Pretty Good Second Installment
","The second Harry Potter film follows Harry and friends through their sophomore year at Hogwarts, the mystical school for young wizards. As has been stressed, now that the ground rules have firmly been established in the first film, the second can focus on deeper character development and plotting. And so it does. Hogwarts, wizards, magic, and all the rest of the J.K. Rowling milieu are taken for granted. They play a Quidditch match without having to explain the rules. Chris Columbus does a great job with the actors, sets, and special effects. Again, we're transporting to a different universe with its own rules and characters. And it works well, its style reminding me of the adventure movies of the 30s, 40s and 50s.  It's a rich mix, but probably much more so for kids that adults. I have only one caution.As an unread Harry fan, I found the plotting unoriginal. Of course, Harry Potter books and movies are for kids, so let's keep it simple. My fear is that the series will reduce itself to Scooby-Doo style rubber stamp stories, one just like the other. Maybe I'd better read them first, to allay my fears.",7,0,0,11 March 2003
Scream 2," Don't Watch w/o Seeing 'Scream' First
","'Scream' reinvigorated the slasher movie, a narrow genre to begin with, and one that I thought exhausted.  It's sequel, 'Scream 2' is very similar to its predecessor in substance and style. Strong character development, clever dialogue, large dollops of humor, and of course lots of scares marks this as way above average. Unfortunately, 'Scream 2' has two significant difficulties for viewers. One is that it's almost a mirror image of 'Scream'. Instead of high school, it's set at a college, but the characters, and set-ups are almost identical. You don't have to see both movies, one is enough. The second problem is that if you haven't seen 'Scream', 'Scream 2' won't make a lot of sense. The plot follows the survivors of 'Scream' to college, where, of course, the carnage begins anew. There are tons of backwards references that don't stand-alone very well, and as for the who-dunnit aspects of the movie's conclusion, knowledge of the original 'Scream' is an absolute necessity.  Therefore, only rent 'Scream 2' if you've also seen 'Scream' and want more of the same. It's exactly what you'll get.",7,1,2,11 February 2001
The Mission," The Story Is Not Fully Developed
","'The Mission' is a lush movie, shot on location in the jungles of Argentina and Colombia. It is set in 18th century Amazonia as the European colonial empire relentlessly moves into the heretofore-unexploited jungle. The Spanish Jesuits are the first Europeans on the scene, and have developed a benign relationship with the aboriginal inhabitants. The imperialists on the other hand want to enslave the Indians and exploit the jungle. The Catholic Church who has sent an emissary from the Vatican will resolve the conflict. Jeremy Irons plays a good-hearted Jesuit, and Robert DeNiro plays a slave trader, who suffers an epiphany after slaying his brother in a rage.   
Sadly, the story is never fully developed, and the inherent conflicts are not exploited. The movie becomes just a pastiche of related scenes lacking a strong narrative theme and supporting characters to tie them together. The story is subsumed by propaganda.  Granted, these are extraordinarily beautiful scenes, but breathtaking scenery is not enough. It feels more like a History Channel lecture than a character-driven story. I'd only recommend it if you have interest in the subject matter, jungle beauty, or one of the actors.",7,6,12,15 September 2002
The Green Mile," A Modern Fable
","'The Green Mile' is staged in a Louisiana prison during the Depression. If this setting doesn't sound depressing enough, make it the prison's death row (aka The Green Mile so named because of the color of the floor).  But 'The Green Mile' is not a litany of prison misery a la HBO's TV series 'Oz'. This is a modern day fable, as fantastical as its medieval forebears, and as multi-layered. The movie is narrated in flashback by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), who, from his current domicile in a retirement home, describes the amazing events that occurred to him and his fellow guards decades earlier. At the outset of the story there are four guards assigned to the Green Mile; three decent men and one sadist, looking after three men condemned to die in the prison's crude electric chair.  One of the condemned men, a giant black man, has a special gift, the gift of healing. There aren't many characters in this 3-hour movie, but it doesn't matter. The screenplay, from a Stephen King novel, moves the story briskly along. The ensemble acting, headed by Hanks, is some of the best of 1999. It's not a happy story, far from it, but it's one worth investing three hours of your time.",9,0,2,15 January 2003
The Lion King," Good, Not Great
","Animated feature films...nobody does 'em better than Disney.  The Lion King is not at the top of the pack, though.  The story is a little on the dark side, and fails to get a grip on the morality it intends to impart.  Somehow the food chain does not lend itself to chirpy song-and-dance.  Especially if you're pretty far down it.Also the characterizations (with the exception of Irons' Scar) are not up to the high standards of the Disney organization.  Ditto for the songs.You won't be wasting your money on rental, it's just that Disney has done better.",8,1,7,11 April 1999
Stalag 17," A Must-See Classic
","If, the first time you 'saw' 'Stalag 17' you were only allowed to listen to the dialogue, and then were asked to place the year the film was made, you'd probably answer that it is a new release, or perhaps from the late 60s or early 70s. You'd answer that way in large measure because the tone of 'Stalag 17' is cynical and irreverent. The main character is what used to be known as an anti-hero; independent, anti-establishment, in it for himself and the rest of the world be damned.  You'd be surprised to learn that the movie was released in 1953 at the height of the Cold War and when memories of WWII were very fresh. But Billy Wilder was the type of artist that could pull this off. And he had support from an extremely talented cast and crew. 'Stalag 17' is ageless; the sharp bite of the dialogue, the great ensemble acting, the stark realism of the sets. If you haven't had the joy of watching this movie, by all means put it on your must-see list.",10,3,6,29 September 2002
Scream," Taut Thriller, with Tongue Firmly in Cheek
","'Scream' is a deliciously witty and well-madeÂ…...slasher movie. Hard to believe, but it's true. Mr. Craven and his screenwriter, Mr. Williamson, have crafted a tight, taut thriller. But one that has it's tongue firmly in it's cheek. It succeeds both as a slasher movie, and as a parody of slasher movies. It's a neat trick, and they pull it off. I highly recommend 'Scream'.",8,0,0,1 January 2001
Paths of Glory," Gripping Anti-War Film
","Paths of Glory is one of the best movies ever made, and possibly the best 'war' movie, period. Paths of Glory does not portray war as conflict between armies or individual soldiers arrayed against one another on the battlefield.  Nor does it portray the acts of great leaders and heroes of war. No this film takes a different tact. The setting is the Western Front of 1916 in the trenches with French soldiers faced off against an invisible German force across a barren No Man's Land. The German's are never seen and the dramatic 'combat' is between vain French officers as they vie for prestige and honors.  The victims are the innocent French soldiers under their command who suffer miserably because of their arrogance and ignorance.Brilliant, gripping, and definitely a 'must see'.",10,90,112,19 January 2000
Back to the Future Part II," A Bit Too Confusing and Dark
","I just loved Back to the Future (the original) when it was released in 1985, and was suddenly struck with the urge to see Part II.   This time the 1985 teen hero travels to the future of 2015, then back to 1955, then to a new alternative, Bladerunner-like present (1985), then back to 1955 before..... Although ok (we gave it a 7 on the 1 to 10 scale) it had some rather serious problems. 1. It's confusing, and would be hopelessly so if you haven't seen the original. 2. It lacks the whimsy of the first installment.  Things seem grimmer, there is even a murder (luckily only heard and read about but nonetheless incongruous to this type of film). 3. Very cutsey commercializations of products like Pepsi, and they are all over the film.  Very obnoxious. 4. An unanticipated problem is their portrayal of how hip and cool the present is (1985), is aging badly.  While in 2015 a scene is filmed in the Club 80s, a 1980s nostalgia club...and now you can't tell what is intentionally or unintentionally camp. And the movie ends with a cliffhanger 'to be continued....Part III.I hope they wrap it up better than Part II.",7,1,2,30 January 1999
The Iron Giant," A Treat for All Ages
","I feel odd, adding the one-jillionth comment to a much-reviewed movie like the Iron Giant. Therefore, I'll keep it brief. 'The Iron Giant' is one of the most intelligent, well-told children's stories I've seen in many years. It transcends age and gender and is a treat to young and old alike.  Well done, Mr. Bird, please make us some more.",8,1,2,10 December 2000
Shrek," Very Good Animated Movie
","'Shrek' is every bit as good as the classic Disney animation films (or at least many of them). Of course, animation has improved over the decades, 'Shrek' being filmed using the new 3-D CGI. But animation is not what made the Disney classics great movies. It was the stories, the characters and the music. The full sweep of drama, comedy, and adventure that was available to live action, except with animation. These movies are for adults as much as for kids. 'Shrek' is also in this class, although the story might seem a little thin and pedestrian. And the moral of the story, well it's been updated a bit to accommodate 21st century tastes. Nonetheless I recommend this movie for adults and kids alike.",8,1,2,29 March 2003
Any Given Sunday," Pretty Enjoyable Football Story
","Oliver Stone's 'Any Given Sunday' creates its story from within the inner workings of a professional football team. Mr. Stone is more restrained (for him at least), and doesn't go as over-the-top with his story a la 'JFK' or visually a la 'Natural Born Killers'.  Though, his editing still might give Grandma a headache. Plot-wise Mr. Stone tells a straightforward football story, and does it well. He gets lots of help from his actors, especially Al Pacino as the embattled coach, and Cameron Diaz, who is surprisingly good as the young, inept team owner. As rentals go, I put this on my Recommended list, but it does not aspire to, nor achieve greatness. This is sad, because regardless of the fact that 'Any Given Sunday' is a decent movie, Stone can do much better.",7,1,2,23 September 2001
Bruce Almighty," Old Time Religion, Modern Hollywood ***Spoilers***
","This is an odd movie; its values are strictly social conservative, but the story takes place against the backdrop of a large city television newsroom. Seem a little incongruous? Its even more so when you realize the primary actors are Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Anniston. And the films style is essentially a slapstick comedy accentuating Carrey's patented rubber-faced, self-effacing schtick. Strange, yes, but a winning combination scoring an $80M opening weekend. Big money maker or not, I found the movie unfunny and boring. The premise that God would select a failed TV newsman to replace Him while He took a vacation is just too absurd. Someone like the Marx Brothers could have had a field day with this premise, but you sure wouldn't have found them developing a maudlin, sappy conclusion like the one that Bruce Almighty serves up. After an hour and a half of mostly unfunny Jim Carrey pratfalls, the movie presents its 'come to Jesus' revelatory moment and Bruce is saved (in the religious sense).  After all the damage he'd done playing God, you'd have thought him more deserving of a one way ticket to Hell.",4,2,4,8 September 2003
Signs," Shyamalan Scores Again
","M. Night Shyamalan takes on alien invasion in 'Signs'. But Night's approach takes a very different tack than most invasion flicks such as 'Independence Day' by telling his story from the perspective of a rural American family who has somehow has found themselves in the middle of the alien's planning process. You've got to suspend disbelief and not be too analytical about the plot, since an apparent key to the alien's invasion scheme is crop circles. And that is what Graham Hess (Gibson) finds in his backyard cornfield one day. He shares his farmhouse with his son (R. Culkin) and his younger brother (Phoenix). Recently widowed through an auto accident, Graham, previously the town's pastor is now a bitter disbeliever. That is until the aliens show up in the neighborhood.I saw 'Signs' at the tail end of its theatrical release and so had read reviews about how the invasion story was not the central theme. Many reviewers posited that the primary story dealt with miracles, coincidence, and the existence of God.  That's too deep for me. I found 'Signs' a very unique approach to the alien invasion story and was surprised at how creepy the movie actually is. The acting and directing are very good (we expect nothing less from a Shyamalan), the plot, although implausible, carries the viewer through the sometimes terrifying ordeal of a family on the periphery of the biggest event in the history of mankind. Highly recommended.",8,0,3,8 February 2003
Sweet and Lowdown," Sean Penn in Great Character Study
","'Sweet and Lowdown' is presented as a Ken Burns-style documentary on the life of 1930s jazz guitar great, Emmet Ray, played by Sean Penn. Woody Allen only appears as an interviewee, talking about the mythical Ray, while 95% of the movie is Ray's adult life told in flashback. It's a great period piece, lovingly assembled by Mr. Allen. And Ray himself, his only redeeming quality that of playing guitar, is wonderfully portrayed by Mr. Penn. Not a story as much as a character study, we follow Ray on his self-destructive, delusional path through the juke joints and jazz clubs of 1930s America. Although this is a Woody Allen movie, it is definitely not a Woody Allen comedy. But it is very, very good, and worth a rental, if only to see Mr. Penn give one of his best performances.",8,0,0,23 February 2002
X2: X-Men United," Wonderful Escapist Fare
","Years ago, when I first heard that X-Men was being brought to the screen I cringed. How could they translate the numbers and complexity of characters within a movie's short time span? Well, Mr. Singer did a good job of it, but had to spend much valuable screen time establishing his characters and their universe. Not so in the sequel, and the previous work pays dividends, allowing him to better develop the plot  and probe deeper into the character's personalities. Also, and this may be a result of having so many subjects to work with, Mr. Singer is not afraid to kill off his main characters, from any of the three conflicting camps. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies. The result is that X2 surpasses the original across the board.",9,0,0,8 July 2003
Amélie," A Perfect Date Movie Amélie
","'Amélie' is the perfect date movie. Or at least my perception of what a date movie should be.  Date movies, especially first-date movies, should be light-hearted romances. Nothing too serious, but not fluff either. 'Amélie' strikes just the right balance between a light-hearted trifle and a film requiring some thought. Life is not a bed of roses for the title character, but there is no grimness, no depression. People your romance with people that are realistic. No one that is too dashing, too beautiful, or too rich to be believable. Amélie and her friends and co-workers are people everyone can relate to, and mostly, would want to know. They're eccentric, but accessible. And finally, have a happy ending. But I can't address this without a ***spoiler*** warning.  'Amélie' deserves all the praise that has been bestowed on it. With a date or by oneself it makes for an excellent rental.",9,1,4,22 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," An Exceptional Ghost Story
","'The Sixth Sense' is one of the best ghost stories told on film, if not the best. The very original story is a creepy delight that keeps the viewer guessing until the last scene. The heavy lifting in the acting department is essentially a two-person show between Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis. They are up to it. And the script and directing by M. Night Shyamalan is tops. If you are one of the few people in the Internet world who has not seen this movie, do so.",9,0,0,5 February 2001
The Truman Show," One Great Movie
","The Truman Show is not a comedy, although that's where I found it at my local video store.  It's a difficult film to categorize; part science fiction, part social satire, part romance.

Rent this movie; you won't be disappointed.One last question is: What the Hell happened at the Academy Awards?",10,0,0,1 May 1999
The Matrix," Buckle Up!
","Combine engrossing Sci-Fi storytelling with the non-stop action of a martial arts film, then add a large dose of special effects and you have The Matrix.
Set is the distant future, machines have taken over a devastated Earth. Humans have long-since been enslaved, spending their entire lives suspended in liquid pods providing energy to the machines.  For their part the machines have created an artificial reality in which the collective consciousnesses of Earth's inhabitants reside, The Matrix.  Guess what? It's patterned after 1999 Earth, and the humans are clueless as to what's happened to them.But not everybody's in The Matrix.  A rebel band led by Fishburn dash in and out of it, rescuing humans and searching for their promised Messiah.  One whom they target is computer programmer Reeves who begins to receive some very odd communications at his terminal...and thus begins the story.The Matrix is both a thrill-a-second roller coaster ride, and a skillfully presented science fiction story.  The story unfolds slowly, as Reeves goes from complete ignorance of his and humankind's fate, to his destiny revealed.  The journey's a trip.If you enjoy films like the Terminator, T2, RoboCop, Face/Off, and Blade Runner definitely go see this film.  If you're a My Dinner with Andre, or Sleepless in Seattle type, give it a pass.",9,0,0,4 April 1999

Will their tenuous thread of luck hold, or will they go down in a modern Gotterdammerung? What Grand Opera is to musicals, 'Heat' is to crime movies. It's well choreographed, loaded with action, fired with fever pitch emotions and tempered by deep personal drama.

The Thin Red Line," Confusing and Pretentious
","Much has been made of Mr. Malik's long retirement and, the tremendous amount of anticipation for his return effort. After I'd seen The Thin Red Line, I was left wondering if he had been cryogenically frozen all these years. It has such a 70s feel to it, and the 70s aspects he uses are one's I find annoying.  Two stand out. First, the voice-over that seems to drone on and on, not moving the story, just talking in the background. The second is the ethereal Zen-ness to the story itself to the point of losing this viewer behind. What was this a story about? I was actually rooting that Malik would show up Spielberg in the WWII movie race, but as it turned out, it was Saving Private Ryan that told a gripping story AND imparted deep moral lessons.  The Thin Red Line just confused me.",4,2,6,31 August 2000

Born on the Fourth of July," Stone and Cruise at Their Best
","Born on the Fourth of July chronicles the deep schisms that divided America during the late 60s and early 70s. The mechanism for conveying the story is the autobiography of Ron Kovic, high school athlete, combat Marine, and anti-war activist.  His story is a tortuous one, from naive All American high school kid, to gung-ho Marine in the battlefields of Vietnam where he is severely wounded and crippled.  It continues through the nightmare of filthy stateside veteran's hospitals and back into a much-changed America. An America being rent apart by the politics of Vietnam which Ron does not understand and from which he feels alienated.Cruise's portrayal of Kovic is some of his best work.  He goes from fresh-faced high school kid, to the tormented battle-weary veteran.  Cruise makes this heavy, dramatic metamorphosis believable; it's a great performance.This is a powerful movie, and one I highly recommend.",9,2,5,18 March 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Very Good Movie, Better Soundtrack
","'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', a retelling of the Odyssey but plomped in 1930s Mississippi, has its champions and detractors. I'm a champion, but understand what the detractors are saying. One criticism is that the movie doesn't hold together, that it's too disjointed. I agree it doesn't have a strong narrative flow, but that's not much of a drawback. The movie is morality play, it's written in crayon, not with a word processor. Criticism two is that it's not on par with the Coens other work like 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo'. So what? It's not supposed to be. And the soundtrack?  It's one of the best in years, and worth the price of a rental by itself.  I found OBWAT a very entertaining movie and definitely worth a rental.",9,0,0,18 January 2002
