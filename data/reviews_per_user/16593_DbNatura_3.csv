Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than the reviews would lead you to believe.
","I've talked to over a dozen people who have seen this movie and they all thoroughly enjoyed it.  Lucas needed to set up the premise for all the movies that follow this one, plus stay true to the three episodes we've already seen and entertain us when we pretty much know what's going to happen.  I feel he succeeded on all counts.  I am looking forward to the next installment when we, hopefully, will get to see more of Ewan McGregor as Obi-wan Kenobi.",8,0,1,9 August 1999

","I was blown away by this movie.  I realize that the professional critics have had a field day with this one as they have with all the previous episodes.  I'll briefly give my response to their comments.The acting was wooden--dialogue too formal. I think that at least some of that is intentional.  It's mainly the Jedi who speak without using contractions and that may be to help show that they are 'outside the norm'.  No spark between Amidala and Anakin or Why would she fall for him? Oh come on.  Those blue puppydog eyes?  The hint of danger?  The old 'he needs me to help him change'?  I think Lucas also lets us know, albeit subtly, that Padme isn't very experienced herself romantically.No surprises. Well, we do know who makes it alive to Episode IV so it's kind of hard to make us believe Obi-Wan might die.  Still, I thought the fight and chase scenes were very well done.  I also liked the view of 'normal' life on Coruscant.  The diner, the club, the advertisements on the street were nice reminders that this is a complete universe.No memorable lines. That one came from Roger Ebert.  Please.  'Good job.'  'I don't think so.' 'Why do I feel you'll be the death of me?'  That's all from me.  I have to go get ready to see it again.",10,0,0,17 May 2002

","I think that the 'El Tango de Roxanne' scene may be the finest ever filmed. Period!  Ewan McGregor shows such a breadth and depth in this movie.  His other work has showcased his range, but never has one picture shown all of it.  Nicole Kidman was a revelation.  I'd never thought of her much one way or the other before this movie, but she was wonderful.  The supporting cast were all brilliant.If there aren't at least Academy Award nominations for the 6 or 7 main characters, Baz Luhrman, set design, costumes and best song; then there is no justice in the world.",10,0,1,7 June 2001
