It," Yawn
","Not good enough, it's a shame that we have kids taking pills to be the best in their classes these days but no one is making a decent horror film. A few jump scares but this was not original and the cgi made it less scary. Decent but I was in my phone at times so it wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention.",4,1,2,2 July 2018
Annihilation," Meh
","I really don't know what to think here. It is definitely Sci-fi and has some action in it but it is such a depressing movie. It also feels very incomplete so I was disappointed to see it end with no big shock factor. It's the kind of movie you're glad you didn't waste your money to see in the theaters. When it comes down to it, it's mediocre and needed more details.",6,1,2,13 January 2019
