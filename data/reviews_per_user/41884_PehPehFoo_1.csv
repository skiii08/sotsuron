Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Origin Story Of Young Ani Skywalker
","Very underrated Star Wars movie in the Skywalker Saga. This is the origin story of how it all began. I enjoyed the Planet Naboo scenes in the movie, some of the underwater scenes are visually stunning, The theme done by John Williams was well executed.",7,0,0,30 June 2020
