Catch Me If You Can," come on people
","i have seen several comments on here about how the story was unbelievable or routine. it was a true story, morons. this actually happened. the writers and directors simply wrote mostly off of what the real-life frank a. told them happened. i hate it when people say movies based on true stories are unbelievable or far-fetched, but if a movie is made based on real life, then chances are that the real life story is unique and unbelievable, otherwise they wouldn't make a movie about it. but aside from that, this movie is excellent, one of the best films of 2002. i never did like leonardo dicaprio before this, but he gave a very good performance, as did hanks, as usual.",Null,0,1,22 June 2004
