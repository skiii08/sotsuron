Casablanca," 'Here's lookin' at you kid.'
","This is such a classic movie. So many quotes that I have heard throughout my life I now know came from this film. I believe the overall message of this film was that you should do what is best for those you love even if you don't want to. Sometimes you have to be selfless. Since it was set in December of 1941 when Pearl Harbor was happening another over all message to the film was that America needs to join the war. This movie was such a similitude- I really believed in the movie and the characters. I felt the movie was heartfelt and certain parts I really felt like I could feel the characters feelings. The sound was wonderful. The scene where the plane was taking off in the beginning was great. As the plane rose over them on the porch you could hear the engine steady, the roar the higher the plane went. The protagonist in this film was Bogart. He was also the main character, you just felt him. Felt his pain, his sorrow, his love, and throughout the whole film the view was on his side. I noticed there was a lot of layering with the camera and the back round scenes. Some were very good and detailed and others you could tell the background was just a back drop that they altered in some way or another. This was a captivating movie. I believe the beautiful lighting had a lot to do with that. There were many parts in this film where there was low key lighting. Very few high key lighting scenes, but the low key made the movie that much more believable. I noticed, and i may be wring, but the only spots where there was a lot of high key lighting was when the theme song played. The lead woman in the film had very distinct lighting throughout the film. It was background lighting to soften her face. Over all I thought this was a good movie. It was quick paced, kept the viewer involved and interested in the film and the characters.",9,0,1,14 October 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," '10 females to each male' In your dreams!
","Who really cares about one man's 'essence?' This was a comedy that I really didn't find too funny. Some films are hard to imagine watching them without wide screen, and this movie is a perfect example of that. There was low key lighting throughout the film and it wasn't that great. I think Kubrick did a good job directing it, i just personally didn't enjoy watching this movie. The camera work on some parts of the film was shaky. It worked for certain parts (like in the beginning when the men first got the message of the attack on the plane, the camera was shaking and it gave the illusion you were on the plane with them -mis-en-scene-) but other times when the camera was shaky it just made the viewer dizzy. This was a very feminist movie, with many sexual references throughout it. I mean there were sexual references put into every thought of this movie, even down to the characters names! I mean really 'Merkin Muffley' Merkin meaning a female pubic wig, and Muff is just another name for public hair. They were basically calling their president a vagina! I got a slight over all message through the movie of the corruption in our government at the time, and how Kubric wanted to make a mockery of it. Some parts of the film had great comic relief, but i didn't understand much of it. Over all- wasn't a huge fan. It was good, but not great.",3,3,10,2 December 2009
The Graduate," Here's to you Mrs. Robinson
","Some might say the soundtrack is too much,(Simon and Garfunkle) I loved every aspect of this movie. It was shot so smart and with such great effort and though. Ground breaking. 180 used all over this film. Sequenceing, timing, pace, each individual part of this movie had such a huge impact while you were watching it. I thought it was so smart and directed well. Montage throughout the whole movie. Director did a great job with the use of his camera during all the driving scenes. They seemed so real, like you were right in the car with them. Non- diagetic, but the songs conformed to the film. This sound track was such a HUGE part of this film. I loved the fast paced plot. The fluidity between the frames and the long takes. Memorable scenes. I really liked this film!",10,1,1,17 December 2009
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino.... what else needs to be said?
","Hands down, one of my favorite movies of all time. I have been a huge QT fan for a long time now, (probably since the first time I have seen Reservoir Dogs) but this movie blew me out of the water. There are so many different aspects to this movie. So many different camera shots, so many different cameos from different movies. QT has this amazing way of telling a movies plot in chapter form and leaving it up to the audience to figure it out. Its so hard to even walk away during one of his movies to go to the bathroom because you are scared you are going to miss some important part of the movie. And believe me, every since frame of his movies are so important to the over all story line. I loved this movie, ground making, must watch, awesome movie!",10,1,3,17 December 2009
Psycho," Classic Goody!
","AMAZING!!!! Hitchcock was such an artist. He had an amazing way of making a character pop out in each in their own way. The viewer could feel the actors emotions through the film. That is not only great acting, that is good directing as well. The picture and directing were wonderful in so many ways. Each frame in the film was so intense and beautifully lit up. The high-key and low key lighting throughout the whole movie was perfect. Hitchcock knew just how to light up a scene then quickly make it dark and dim for just the right element of three key lighting. He made it look easy. An example is the back lighting he would use whenever the film showed the house normal bates (Anthony Perkins) lived in with his mother. The house looked scary and evil. Hitchcock payed attention to every detail in all of his films. For a film directed in 1960 is still gave me the creeps. Going into this movie i had assumed that it was going to be similar to the movie in 1998, but it was totally different. I loved this one much more.",10,0,0,2 December 2009
The Wizard of Oz," 'Follow the Yellow Brick Road'
","This by far is my favorite movie of all time. I have never seen anything that would ever surpass it. How wonderful every aspect of this movie is. From the lighting to the costumes to the scenes. Victor Flemming out did himself on this film in so many ways. Even though he made his mark directing films all the way from 1919-1956 this by far I believe to be the best film he had ever directed. (Gone with the wind, Joan of Arc, and Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde are other classics of his- but in my opinion they are not in the same boat as this film!) From the moment the film started you were caught up with Dorthy Gale (Judy Garland) and cant take your eyes off her. So beautiful and innocent. For this film only being 101 minutes long it seems much longer because it was so detailed and vibrant. Even today if you watch the movie you still get caught up in it and end up loving it no matter who you are or what age. I also believed Margaret Hamilton (The Wicked Witch of the West) did such an amazing job. I watched this movie for probably the 100th time in my life and her character still shakes me up a little bit. I loved how the movie went from sepia tone and when the gates of oz opened up then it went into Technicolor. I thought that was such an amazing effect, especially for its time. The lighting and scenes in this movie are totally MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) quality. Each scene, costume, lighting, character, is out of this world cool and back then so expensive. Bright lighting throughout the film showed how much money time and effort Fleming put into this film. Timeless classic, must see, life isn't complete without seeing it. Lions, and tigers, and bears- OH MY! I've got you my pretty! And your little dog too! Follow the Yellow Brick Road---- And who could forget--- the munchkins!!! We represent the Lolly-pop kids the Lolly-pop kids- THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!",Null,2,3,22 October 2009
