Requiem for a Dream," brace yourself--
","like having brain surgery with rusty implements.like watching someone (okay, four someones) skin themselves.like finding out what 'catharsis' *really* means, the (very) hard way.
the editing is absolutely state of the art.the soundtrack is an achievement in its own right.the acting is some of the best each actor has ever done.and the storytelling, characterization and camerawork are a quantum leap forward from the already harrowingly impressive 'pi'.there is no way our current ratings system can quantify this movie.  I would rather-- however awful the images this movie contains-- a high school student saw this NC-17 movie unedited than an R-rated brainless actioner with a sky-high body count.to call this film 'anti-drug' is too simple.  what this movie really opposes is everything that erodes the capacity for self-determination, from television brainwashing to unethical doctors to racist ganglords.this is-- there is no question about it-- one of the most disturbing films you may ever see.  but like its characters, this movie loves even life's awful dark dreary twisted moments too intensely to look away.",9,0,1,5 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Easy on the eyes, hard on the ears.
","How can it be that the same director that got subtle, nuanced human interactions in 'american graffiti' cannot now direct a love scene to save his life (or his series)?And do the amazing (and they *are* amazing-- the final Yoda scene alone will redeem this film for star wars fans) special effects and plot innovations counterbalance the urge you'll have to laugh (or worse) during those times Anakin and Amidala are stuck on-screen together alone?These are questions which just might be worth a viewing or two to answer, but expect some unintentional snickers among the cheers.",6,0,0,17 May 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," MIA: Quentin's sense of humor, pacing, dialogue...
","Throughout this long, relentless contest of wills with his audience, Quentin still displays flashes of skill.But it feels like he's been out of the game so long he isn't even going to try to compete with the edgy movies of the last few years, and retreats headlong into the 70s ethos he knows so well instead.As a Hong-Kong splatter flick, it's too long and emotional, with a few good scenes stranded in otherwise lackluster writing and directorial choices, coming up well short of the genre's best.  As a witty Tarantino neo-noir, it's *too* gory to be chilling or effective, too straightforward to be really clever or engaging, too monotonous to impress an audience with Matrixes and Ring-quests fresh in their minds.Simply put, 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' (and even 'Jackie Brown') *resembled* classic noirish gangster movies, but were actually *much better* than the source movies that inspired them.Sadly, Quentin may now be far gone enough to want to pay such loving tribute to the 70sploitation era that he will completely hide his talent to create a *true* b-movie, one that hits every note so (im)perfectly it's just as forgettable, meaningless, and poorly assembled, as the movies to which he's paying homage.I'll reserve final judgment until Vol. 2 comes out, but until then, I'd only recommend this one to indiscriminate fans of action movies and bad, really bad, 70s fare.",7,0,1,13 October 2003
