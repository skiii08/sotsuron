Lucky Number Slevin," This is one hella ride
","Lucky Number Slevin is a surprise of a film- It takes from the best, namely Hitchcock and Tarantino in its approach to writing and directing and boy is it a ride. Keeping things unpredictable and breezy Lucky Number Slevin is a riot of a movie. The acting from everyone from Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Lui to old veterans like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley is great- you know they're all having fun. You should too- go see it.",Null,0,0,27 July 2018
Marie Antoinette," Visually fantastic but lacking in story or character
","This is a misfire by Sofia Coppola not because it is a bad film but because considering the subject it could have been so much more than what we have got. MarieAntoinette is mostly about the Dauphine's adjustments to the customs of the French court and her attempts to conceive. The more interesting material, including a possible affair and the growing unrest of the common people, is left to the film's final 40 minutes. By then, a portion of the audience will have fallen asleep. The movie looks great, with impeccable period detail and glorious visuals, but the plot is stagnant. The lack of character development results in an uninteresting story. Plus, there's no villain to provide conflict. For a while, it appears that Madame du Barry might fill the role, but she is removed about half-way through the film, leaving a void. This is a disappointing film.",Null,1,1,28 December 2018
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's last offering just might be his most enigmatic
","This was the legendary Stanley Kubrick's final film(he passed away literally a few days after the film's premiere). Now, is it a good film? That depends on what you are looking for. This is a work of high authority and one can see Kubrick's influence in each frame. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play real life couple in high society New York(completely recreated on a London soundstage). They are invited a party where sexual dealings and offerings are exchanged which leads to an altercations of sorts later at home. What follows is a ride into a rabbit hole by Cruise's character involving sex cults, orgies, identities and obsessions. The film isn't as heavy handed as it appears and the pacing is very good. Worth a watch.",Null,0,0,20 July 2018
Valkyrie," Fantastic WW2 subject interpretation for film
","Bryan Singer's Valkyrie is a great attempt at showcasing one of the most fascinating chapters of WW2- the assassination attempt on Hitler's life by a brave German named Claus von Stauffenberg, played rather impressively by Tom Cruise. The plot is historically accurate and the setting and production is so good you'd be astonished to know that the locations are all fake (apparently the German authorities refused to let the filming happen on actual locations). The pacing needs a mentioning as it is absolutely amazing- the film literally flows from one scene to the next, which is a given since it follows an event in real time. This is a great watch.",Null,0,0,30 August 2018
