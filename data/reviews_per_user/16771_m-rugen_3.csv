Lucky Number Slevin," This movie should easily be in the top 250.
","Usually a 7.8 average is good for IMDb users, but not for me. This movie is beyond amazing. The acting, the premise, the plot: everything. Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley all give 100% performances. Lucy Liu and Stanley Tucci were also very good considering I've rarely seen them in any movies like Lucky Number Slevin.While some may say you can easily figure out the plot from the beginning, I did not. But even if you can, it still keeps you glued to the screen. The ending, especially, is arguably one of the best endings in any movie I have ever seen (very close to The Mist).I have never seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or The Usual Suspects, which is odd because I am a huge movie buff, but really, this movie is absolutely outstanding. I suggest it to anybody.Even if you hated the movie, I can guarantee the ending/the last half hour will leave you speechless.",10,1,6,21 August 2008
Avatar," I see you.
","James Cameron's latest attempt, Avatar, is no longer an attempt. Avatar is the most visually beautiful film I have seen in the past ten years. It is a stroke of utter and complete genius. James Cameron brings to life an entirely new way to create a world. With only 40% of live-action material, Cameron created a world so renown and so stunning that for over 2 and 1/2 hours our eyes are glued to the screen. Cameron has a way of allowing you to be awed by the beautiful world that is Pandora while still paying close attention to what's right in front of you. The visuals do not take away from the movie in any way. Everything is superb from start to finish. Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana, Joel Moore, and everyone else are excellent in their respective roles. I've read some of these comments on here and can't fathom why people do not like this movie. Yes, the movie drags on a bit, but if the movie were only 2 hours long, people would complain that there was no character development or some parts were left unfinished. James Cameron takes you through Jake Sully's transformation in such a way that you actually believe in your own mind that you were watching a human being turn into something completely different, all while not missing a beat.You don't have to like or dislike any of Cameron's other films in order to decide whether or not you want to see this movie. This is a masterpiece from start to finish, in every aspect of the movie. The fact that this has an 8.8 is superb but only #25 on the Top 250 is beyond me. The Dark Knight was a great movie but it does not deserve to be #9 with Bale's shotty performance (as usual).Avatar may simply be one of the most artistic movies ever made, and I mean this with no exaggeration. Undoubtedly the most beautiful film I've seen since The Green Mile. Granted I've only seen The Green Mile for the first time last week, but going back to 1999, I can't think of any better movies.Avatar ranks up their with the best, and it deserves to win every award that it is nominated for. Simply put, a stunning 10 out of 10.",10,17,27,28 December 2009
Semi-Pro," People forget that Will Ferrell's movies are randomness.
","So far I am the fourth person to rate this movie; and I honestly don't agree with anybody else here. I really only rate movies I truly enjoyed, and this is one of them. I don't think anybody that has seen Will's movies and disliked them should be commenting on here.This movie, along with Anchorman and Talladega Nights, is just a whole bunch of funny, cruel, and vulgar jokes thrown into a 90-minute story line...and it's awesome.Also, the fact that it's loosely based upon a real merger between the ABA and NBA fits the movie. Sports movies with fake teams and cities is getting overly boring.As many people will tell you, the unrated versions of Anchorman and Talladega Nights blow the original PG-13 rating out of the water. And for this, is why the writers had to make this movie rated R to begin with.The movie was designed for Will Ferrell. Granted, it's another sports movie with him, but he pulls it off again. Wrestling a bear, performing dance, and singing a song called 'Love Me Sexy' has absolutely nothing to do with basketball, but it works. Like I said, all his movies are a bunch of random jokes thrown together to fit a storyline.This movie, to me, is better than Talladega Nights. If you like Will Ferrell, you will LOVE this movie. If you don't like Will Ferrell, you need to get yourself checked out.",10,39,75,29 February 2008
