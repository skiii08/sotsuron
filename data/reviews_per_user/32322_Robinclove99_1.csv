Catch Me If You Can," You Can't Outrun Reality
","Spoiler HereinThe movie 'Catch Me If You Can' was very entertaining.  This is a film based on a true story about a young man named Frank Abignale played by Leonardo Dicaprio.  Frank at a very young age began to trick and outrun the FBI for quite a while before being caught.  This film shows some of the escapades that happen while running from FBI agent Carl Handready played by Tom Hanks.
A theme I found present through out the film is that no matter how hard or fast you run reality always has a way of catching up with you.  Frank began his life of crime to escape the reality of his family.  Frank's last fond memory before he began his life of crime was of Christmas time and Frank is reminded of this memory at the end of the film, before everything comes crashing down (or so he thinks).  Another theme through out the film is that Frank was against labels.  You can see how he rejects them figuatively and personally in his own life.  One of the funniest moments in the film is full of the labels off of bottles and jars.High contrast lighting is used in the film on both characters at different times to highlight them in a scene.  This technique can be seen in a few scenes and was very effective.  This film's lighting was like that of 'Chicago', while most of the lighting was played down, at important moments such as a running scene or court scenes I found its use to be imperative to both films.The relationship between the two main characters is the one constant in the film no matter how much running goes on.  Both characters are loveable through their chase in the film and I found myself pulling for both.  The fact that everything catches up to you in the end is through out the film and ties in nicely at the end.",Null,0,1,19 March 2004
