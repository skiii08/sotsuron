Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat Will Be this Year's Sensation!!! I Will Bet my Life or Sacrifice myself to Kazakhstan!!
","Seriously I just saw the screening tonight at the Cineplex Odeon at the Marketplace in Marina Del Ray and let me just tell you the audience was going nut-so bonkers for the lovable Kazakhstani, very offensive, crude, but it reveals a lot about America's dark underbelly at the same time so it is quite shocking actually. This movie is so anti-semitic it is so bad, so terrible, so crude it is a masterpiece of offensive cinema. There is a naked fight scene between Borat and his fat-so Producer that will go down in the annals of film history as one of the most terribly hilarious and disgustingly magical moments caught on film ever. I hope very little gets cut from this very early print because it is a masterpiece of Kazakstani Cinema.",10,155,327,2 February 2006
The Mist," Not since Aliens has such a Movie Perfectly Bottled Fear in its Purest Essence
","Wow. Holy f-ing s---. I can't remember a movie that got me saying that phrase aloud so many times in a theater full of people. And there was a little girl sitting next to me too, but I guess if her dad thinks its cool for her to see a movie like The Mist, I don't think he's one to complain about my language... Anyways onto the review of The Mist. This is not a normal B movie monster flick, but with Frank Darabont directing I would think not anyways. I haven't read Stephen King's novella this film is based on but this is one hell of a roller-coaster ride. What makes it so good is that the film makes you care for the poor people that are stuck in the mess of being surrounded by mist full of monsters ready to devour them at any moment.The human reaction to their surroundings and infighting that results from their situation is what makes this film stand out above the rest of your every day horror films. Plus the protagonists groups excursions into the pharmacy next door was very reminiscent of the classic scene in Aliens when the Space Marines sweep the Alien hive in the main processing station has a scene captured that oh sh-- effect of knowing something terrible is going to happen and then WHAM! it does. Actually the scene was a little too familiar if you catch my drift(POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Cocoons, live body being exploded from organisms from within, acid webs? LOL) But if your gonna rip a scene off might as well rip it from a classic.In conclusion SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",10,4,13,24 November 2007
