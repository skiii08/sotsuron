Casablanca," Here's lookin' at you, Bogie
","Of all the great tragedies which have befallen the movie industry during its long and storied existence, would there have been any greater had Ronald Reagan been selected for the role of Rick Blaine, as was originally intended?",Null,0,0,27 May 2001
The Godfather," Take my advice
","Even if you aren't a fan of 'gangster' (I ashamedly use this overworked and extremely juvenile description for the sake of clarification- this movie deserves much better!) movies, or aren't fond of movies in general, this is a must-see!The sheer power and volatility which emanates from every scene and every dialogue will mesmerize and captivate you!  At times the graphic violence makes you want to look away, but you find yourself held fast to the film's hypnotic lure.  The masterful story-telling, superb casting, and richly authentic ambience combine to create a once-in-a-lifetime work of art- a bold and breathtaking saga of not only the Corleone Family, but of a culture and world heretofore unknown to the vast majority of mainstream Americana. It is an incredible tale both heart-stopping and gut-wrenching, at once amazingly complex and beautifully simple.  Salud!",Null,0,1,2 August 2001
