The Hangover," the best film i have ever seen
","LOVED IT! its the best film I've seen funny,not too horny, great acting,some real life situations, the most i have liked about the film is its idea = they party so hard, they do some messed up stuff and they have to take the consequences. Favorite part: When they take the baby and name it Carlos (Such a good name) but its f*cked up to have a stripteaser as a mother ( my opinion thought) So yea i think its a really good movie and i would rank the saga exactly like the numbers: Hangover 1 is the best, Hangover 2 is the second and Hangover 3 is the 3rd, so yea. I don't really know what to say since i don't have anything else to write about this film and IMDb wont let me but 10 lines or less.",10,1,2,14 September 2015
