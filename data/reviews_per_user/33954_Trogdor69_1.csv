The Ring," great, great scary flick
","I got a chance to a screener of this last night( I work at an AMC theatre) and I must say I was really impressed.  The movie starts off like a typical teen slasher flick, but you soon see it's nothing like that at all.  It's a mystery, but the truly frightening elements to the story are the unknown. As the mystery unravels it does get more intense.  And I might add that the disturbing imagery is exactly that, this movie should be rated R.  If you are looking for the type, think of it as a cross between 'the 6th sense' 'stir of echoes' and the recent 'feardotcom'.",Null,0,0,26 September 2002
