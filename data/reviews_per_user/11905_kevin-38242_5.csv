10 Cloverfield Lane," Nowhere near as bad as I feared
","This movie has 'Coverfield' in the name, and shares at least a director with that earlier movie. In fact, I bought it on blu-ray in a double pack. So, having seen the earlier movie, which was a very humdrum affair in all respects except the visual arts, I wasn't expecting much.In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. 10CL centres on the tense relationships between three people confined -- willingly or not -- in a survival bunker. Some unspecified 'attack' has taken place, and it seems that the outside world is uninhabitable. It looks OK, however, through the airlock window, so the real situation is unclear. As the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the owner of the bunker is somewhat unstable, and may even be a murderer. The three folks in the bunker are the only actors with more than a couple of lines, and all the performances are excellent.But (spoiler coming...) Having seen Cloverfield, I always assumed that space monsters or some-such would be involved somewhere. I mean, why would the filmmakers choose this name except to make that exact connection? This rather killed the suspense for me. Had the link been unclear -- had it been uncertain right up until the last moment whether the surface was safe or not -- it would have been a better movie. Sure, 'Howard' -- the bunker's owner -- is a fruitcake, and he may have a sinister motive for keeping a young woman trapped. But that in no way precludes a genuine disaster having taken place as well.There is an FAQ entry attached to this IMDb entry that says, essentially, that the film-makers did not intend any particular relationship between 10CL and Cloverfield. It's true that we don't see the same monsters, and there are continuity problems if the events in 10CL are intended to follow directly after those in Cloverfield. But I assumed right from the start that when Howard suggested the world had been invaded by 'Martians', he was referring to the events in Cloverfield. So when the monsters eventually appeared, I was not surprised. I'm only surprised that other reviewers found the ending genuinely unexpected -- I can only imagine that they never saw Cloverfield, or had forgotten its plot.In short, this is a potentially excellent movie, slightly let down by the plot give-away inherent in its title and authorship.",6,0,0,23 January 2017
It Follows," Different, but plot and acting do not live up to the cinematography
","It's good to see a movie which is clearly made by a team that still sees cinema as an art form, rather than nothing more than a cynical way to part people from their money. The presentation is spooky, weird, and atmospheric; the music -- although not something I would listen to other than as a film soundtrack -- is a good fit to the 80s-style dystopian environment in which the action takes place . The film is mostly not outright scary, but it was tense and creepy. I was willing to forgive it a great deal.In the end, though, it didn't convince me, because the plot isn't even internally consistent, the characters do not behave in a credible way, and the acting isn't compelling enough to conceal these facts. Now, I'm not a complete reactionary, and I accept that a convincing story can be told without adhering to a real-world, linear-time narrative. But the story does have to hold at least to the basic premises of the fantastical world in which it is played out; characters have to behave in a way that is at least broadly recognizable as compatible with human nature.Yet here we have a woman who is cynically induced into a sexual relationship so that her partner can pass on a 'curse' to her. You might expect that, when these characters meet again, there will at least be harsh words, if not violence. And yet the woman and her friends -- who in any real-world scenario would be spitting mad -- seem not to realize that they're dealing with an exploitative, wicked man. Later they casually discuss the possibility of female lead's passing on the curse in the same way, with no obvious interest in the ethical implications. Real folks just don't behave in the way this film portrays them -- not even teenagers. The characters are young people with homes and parents, and yet neither homes nor parents feature in the story, even in situations where we might reasonably expect them to, given the way in which they are portrayed.The monster, or demon, or whatever it is, can clearly transport itself over large distances by non-physical means, yet cannot cope with a locked door. In the vicinity of the victim, it can't seem to move faster than a shamble, and yet it can climb onto a roof. It changes form unpredictably in a surreal, nightmare-like way, yet it has a physical presence and interacts with characters other than those subject to the curse, even though they cannot see it. Movie monsters don't have to obey real-world limitations, of course, but they do have to behave in ways that are self-consistent, and compatible at least with the laws of physics as they are interpreted in the fantasy world created by the story. The Terminator, for example, can withstand a shotgun blast, but the human characters don't have to worry that it can teleport or read their minds, because that would be inconsistent with the story as it is told. The 'It,' however, has no character or properties that make sense even in the film's own world.I did not expect a happy ending to this film, but I did expect _an_ ending. However, it appears if the writer just wrote a bunch of spooky scenes and then ran out of ideas. I felt that the picture could have just faded to black at any point in the last 30 minutes, and it would have made no difference.In summary, a nicely-made, atmospheric movie, badly let down because the writer did not seem to know whether he was describing a sequence of events that took place in some world, albeit possibly a fantastical one, or a nightmare with no logic or consistency at all.",5,3,9,14 September 2015
Jurassic World," Stop the press: dinosaurs are still scary
","It's a 1960s B-movie with 2015 special effects. The basic plot premise is that a giant, genetically-engineered dinosaur goes postal and starts eating everybody. A small band of plucky folks have to save the day. Well, whoopie-doo.What salvages the film is that the dinosaurs are amazingly well-executed, and very frightening. There's a real sense of dread, even though we know that in a movie of this type the heroes ... well that would be a spoiler, I guess, although I'm sure everybody knew how the movie would end after the first ten minutes.All in all, a thoroughly one-dimensional movie -- long on dramatic effects, short on everything else. But enjoyable enough, so long as you're not expecting great art.",4,1,5,1 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What cinema is for (but why not just call it a remake, and have done with it?)
","I saw this movie in 3D IMAX, and it blew me away. You surely can't get any nearer to taking part in space battle than this. It was so captivating at the time that I didn't really think about the plot, or the back-story, or the acting. I came out of the cinema wanting to go straight back in and watch it again, and it's not very often I can say that. In fact, if it wasn't so stupidly expensive (Â£60 for a family of four? Sheesh!) I might have done just that. This is exactly the kind of thing that cinema was invented for.It's a good thing that I saw it in the format I did, however. Having had chance to think about it, I believe that if I'd watched it for the first time on DVD, I would have been shockingly disappointed. It's essentially a jumble of plot elements from the original Episode IV, held together with cardboard-cutout acting (not you Mr Ford -- you were OK). I guess claiming this to be a sequel to Episode VI allowed the film-makers to recruit all the old gang (those who are still alive, at least) from the original movies. It's certainly interesting to think about where Han Solo, Princess Leia, et al., would be thirty years after the fall of the Empire. There are plenty of back-references to the original movies ('Is there a trash compactor anywhere?') to amuse the middle-aged and nerdy.But a new story surely demands a new plot, and it's not clear to me that we get one. The plot of Episode IV was pretty strong, for a fantasy, and the movie clearly placed the action in the context of wider politics and history. But it wasn't so strong that we needed to see it used as the foundation for a new movie with the same characters.In short, this is a movie that demands to be seen on a hundred-foot 3D screen; anything less engaging will allow the viewer to see the flaws all too easily.",7,4,29,26 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Not as bad as it might have been
","Modern remakes of thirty-year-old movies are often disappointing, for many reasons. One of those reasons, I'm sure, is that our expectations are higher -- we want a movie that is not just as good as the original, but better by thirty-years' worth of improvement in the art and science of cinematography.In this respect, at least Fury Road confounds expectations: it is better in almost every way than the originals; there's no question that it's thirty years ahead, at least in the technological aspects of film-making. Problem is -- the originals weren't all that wonderful themselves. No, really, they weren't. To be fair, Mel Gibson did a decent job, given the constraints of the writing, and managed to make his character at least slightly believable -- something that can't be said for Tom Hardy, but that's probably not his fault, given what he had to work with.Aside from Mr Gibson, however, the original Max films were pretty so-so: not the worst movies I ever wasted my youth on, but not all that memorable, either. So it shouldn't be all that hard for a modern, big-budget movie to improve on them; and mostly it does.Realizing that the original Max movies didn't have much of a plot to start with, Fury Road seems to have decided not to bother with one at all. What we get instead is a riot of fast-paced, brutal violence in what seems to be a computer-enhanced version of the Australian bush. The cinematography is utterly captivating -- it's impossible to look away, as one all-too-convincing act of gratuitous violence follows another.There are some interesting, peculiar touches however, that suggest that this is a bit more than the usual big-budget, macho bullshit fandango. First, there's a measure of symbolism. The white-faced, stunted characters that operate the tyrant's machinery are strikingly similar to the subterranean workers in Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis.' Lang's workers depict the drudgery and soullessness that modern industrial society imposes on ordinary men and women; Fury Road's mutants -- or whatever they are -- could be seen as playing a similar role. Like Lang's workers, they are utterly disposable, nothing more than a sacrifice to the great machine Moloch. In the characters' search for the lost 'Green Place,' the film hints at our quest for a utopia that we know can never be achieved.Second, the female heroine (or anti-heroine) Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, has a physical disability. This is shockingly rare in a mainstream movie, even set in an environment where such things might be expected to be commonplace.Third, the attention to detail is incredible. It's so good, in fact, that you don't notice it. There are (so far as I can tell) none of the distracting continuity errors that plague most blockbuster movies that are made for audiences with a five-second attention span. If a character gets a bruise in one scene, it's still there in the next one. Props don't just appear out of nowhere. This may seem a small point, but in a cinema industry that is increasingly complacent and contemptuous of the audience, it isn't.If fact, given what it is, it's a great movie. Unfortunately, what it is, doesn't amount to all that much. Relentless fighting with no underlying human interest gets old very quickly. I wouldn't have minded if the movie had been an hour shorter -- everything it has to say, could be said in an hour.",6,2,5,26 January 2016
