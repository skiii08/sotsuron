Angels & Demons," Rehashed novel fails on many levels
","I think it would be fair to say that the impressive cast was attracted by the equally impressive pay-packets they were undoubtedly offered as well as the chance to partake in a movie that will deliver at the Box Office.I am not somebody who likes to constantly compare literature to filmic adaptations as they are stand alone art of different mediums and as such deserve to be judged on individual merit. However, it is impossible to read 'Angels and Demons' and not be frustrated by the alterations that have taken place in adapting the novel for film.After reading the novel I believed that the film would be significantly more successful the the Da Vinci adaptation for the primary reason that the novel is not as focused on theological details that were lost in the adaptation of The Da Vinci Code. The pace of the novel is also more suited to adaptation and the setting of Rome had the potential for incredible cinematography.Before I define why this film is worthy of a 4/10 rating I will say that the film was well paced (as it should have been), Tom Hanks was likable as Langdon (despite initial casting concerns) and the powers that be graciously decided to omit Langdon's farcical helicopter dive towards the end of the novel (why on god's earth did Dan Brown include this pathetic episode in an otherwise decent book). That being said, the film, as an adaptation fails on so many levels.If you have not read the book I would argue that you will not leave the cinema demanding a refund, but those who have read the book will be hugely disappointed by an opportunity missed to create a really decent Dan Brown adaptation.Tonally the film was vacant,but deep down with Hanks and Howard involved, fine craftsmen as they may be, it was never going to the dark and sinister thriller it should have been.I was however, deeply frustrated by the unwillingness of the director/producers to opt for a riskier but longer run time that would allow the novel to be more honestly adapted. The Langdon/Vetra love interest was rightly omitted - I don't think anyone would say it had any impact whatsoever in the novel, but unbelievably they chose to omit 99% of all the background information that made the characters interesting and motivated - Vetra's relationship with her adopted father paralleling the relationship between Camerlengo and the diseased pope.The conflict between science and religion was addressed in the loosest terms and sadly the CERN narrative was completely ignored, leading to a not so clever twist and bland storyline. Where was Kohler, one of the most interesting characters in the book? Why did they decide to rewrite the assassin of 'Hassassin' character. His physical presence, fanatical stance and twisted morality was an ominous presence in the book and yet the powers that be decided that he would be better written as a 'bit character' from 24 - a 'gun for hire' - SERIOUSLY WTF!!!!!!! They also decide to rewrite the character of Olivetti in a bid to relieve the film of any interesting, conflicted characters that might offer any element of tension. I actually left the theatre angry at the fact that supposedly 'professional people' allowed the film to be made in this way.Maybe worst of all is the dialogue. If I another Dan Brown adaptation hits our screens with the characters explaining their thought processes to the person standing next to them, I may be forced to punch the screenwriter. People DON'T talk like that!With background, non existent, character diluted and a pretty shady script, 'Angels and Demons' will be just another box-office hit with no substance. Sadly, it could have been so much more. This had the potential to be the best of all the Dan Brown adaptations and I am sad to say it is an opportunity missed. The 7/10 rating will probably remain, but, it will not be on merit! If the Vatican interests you watch Godfather Part 3 as Angels and Demons is certainly one you can afford to miss.",4,0,1,19 May 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Because stupidity isn't always bad...
","It is not often that I comment upon a film that has done nothing to move or upset so I thought I would break with tradition and offer my opinions.First off - as a film, LAC is not terrible. The stand out aspect of the film is that it is able to maintain its pace without breaking stride, allowing the audience no time to dwell on the utter ridiculousness that is the plot. Now I may be naive as to the way the American Legal system works but it appears that, for the sake of a tidy narrative, it would be appropriate to have a Lawyer, who also acts as lead interrogator, who also heads the investigation against our 'lead man' who incidentally used to be his client.It is also a little confusing as to who we are routing for. Clyde Shelton - a wronged man who decides he should kill everyone who got close to reading an article about the murder of his family, or, Nick Rice, who seems to route for Sheldon until the point at which Clyde decides to fool around with Nick's life.This issue of loyalty to our leads also begs us to ask the question why Clyde didn't decide to take immediate action against Nick, who was, let's face responsible for cutting a deal with the man who raped and killed his family.Herein lies the problem that the well paced plot forces the writers to completely bumble any sense of integrity in either character.Viewers may also find some points of the film a little to convenient, making a great show like 24 look positively plausible. A few people have moaned about how a nice guy, turns so very bad, but given the way his life was turned upside down, I didn't really have a problem with a brutal reaction from Clyde. The implausibility however, is dragged to red-alert, when we realise that Clyde only has a couple of people who he should really be punishing - so we are forced to endure a supposedly moral man bump off lawyers for the sake of making the movie last more than thirty minutes.There is also a big question mark as to how the rapist and murderer, managed to get off with pretty much a telling off, while his accomplice who seemed to be no more than a voyeur gets the death penalty. But, as we quickly learn, this is a film the will consistently, until the final credits role, ignore the unignorable in a bid to keep the story accelerating.The film has its violent moments, which some may object to, but given the whole ridiculous mess, they may not prove to be offensive as they otherwise could be.Criticism aside however, I did not feel like asking for the price of my ticket back and it will certainly keep you entertained. If you are prepared to sit back and not reflect too deeply on the utter stupidity of the film, give it a try. If you are the type of person who watches superman and says 'that would never happen' save your breath and go watch something else.6/10 - Because stupidity isn't always bad.",6,1,1,22 January 2010
