Marie Antoinette," Very entertaining
","I found this to be a great interpretation of the life of Marie Antoinette. Kirsten Dunst was very charming as the leading lady. The film contains just the right amount of humor and wit in the right places. There are some AWESOME cinematography shots and the period costumes were gorgeous. One of my favorite scenes was the montage of Marie Antoinette selecting fabrics and shoes. Curiously, there was a pair of light blue Converse sneakers in the closet in one of the shots. At first, I thought that this may have been a blooper. But as I thought about it, the sneakers may have been included intentionally to add dimension to this 'artful' film. The film is a slightly modern and 'young' take on this historical figure. The soundtrack includes recent pop tunes and the actors speak in 'today's' language, for the most part. This is definitely worth watching.",9,0,1,26 December 2006
