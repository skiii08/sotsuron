Casablanca," Justifiably popular, but 'great'?
","I think this film is a sentimental favorite with audiences because it's just a really good party: a beautifully photographed assemblage of fascinating people in a glamorous setting. It's fun to spend two hours in Casablanca with Rick and Sam and Ilsa and all their far-flung friends. But when you come down to it it's not much of a story; whether it doesn't make logical sense or is just too boring to follow is something I've never decided, and lines like 'Play it, Sam' and 'I stick my neck out for no one' are famous because of who said them in a gorgeous white linen jacket, not what's being said. Like 'Dracula' or 'Titanic,' it's appealing as entertainment. But to label it 'great' is to give this little fluffy war romance more weight than it was ever meant to bear.",Null,3,6,4 August 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget Jones's diarrhoea
","No WONDER Bridget Jones is lonely and at loose ends at thirty-two: she's an immature, self-centered nonentity with a drinking problem and serious impulse control. By the end of the film I loathed this character. But I will say that my sister, who dragged me to this film, was laughing and clapping and cheering her on, and so were a lot of other people in the theater. Well, they're free to identify with her...ick.",1,15,29,13 April 2001
Spider-Man," The best and worst Hollywood has to offer
","One one hand this film sets the standard for what a Hollywood superhero movie should be. Instead of camping it up or trying to take the story to another level that throws away the fundamental ingenuous appeal of the original comic (which is what happened with both the television and film incarnations of 'Batman') it is a true live action comic book, presenting its juvenile, melodramatic subject matter with sincerity and a straightforward graphic flair that without being at all obvious about it provides a genuine analog to the classic Marvel style.On the other hand, the fact that it is nothing more than another extremely costly Hollywood comic book come to life makes it infuriating viewing for anyone watching with a brain not on idle. Seldom has a contemporary film dared to present such a blatantly retro-Hollywood misogynist worldview, with its musclebound, power-obsessed male protagonists demonstrating only the most primitive interests in the only two female characters, a deferential old lady (ROSEMARY HARRIS???? isn't this a little like casting Laurence Olivier as Grandpa Walton?) who mainly exists to serve food and a young woman (Kirsten Dunst, augmented breasts jutting awkwardly from anorectic ribcage) whose purpose is to totter on high heels between encounters with males bent on raping/murdering/courting/protecting her. Watching pretty Toby Macguire ecstatically shooting through the air on threads of spermlike 'silk' and stolidly rejecting the woman he 'loves' because he has more important things to do than actually stick around and have a relationship with her--like zipping around in the night chasing other muscular fellows in tight suits with his sperm-thrower--tells you all you need to know about subtext here. Yeah, just keep telling yourself, it's only a movie.",7,0,0,2 June 2002
Man on the Moon," A dumber Andy for a dumber age?
","As I recall the appeal of Andy Kaufman was that he did a hip, sophisticated act, somewhere between state-of-the-art standup and museum-quality performance art. In this film he's portrayed as an obnoxious, antisocial jerk whose humor mostly consisted of alternately insulting and boring people. Which I suppose is credible as the 'Kaufman for Dummies' version, but hardly the whole story. Anyway, the very stale, predictable Hollywood biopic style of the film is so far beneath the intelligence of its subject that it's practically nonsensical. How can a stupid film properly celebrate a smart man?",3,1,2,27 December 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," That's girl power!
","Jodie Foster has said that she liked this story because the heroine got to be genuinely heroic--though sometimes in danger, she was never cast as a victim (a rule flagrantly broken in 'Hannibal,' one of the many reasons why it'll never count as an authentic sequel to 'Lambs.') Clarice Starling is the most imaginatively realized female character in American film history, as well as one of its few genuinely believable action heroes. It's easy to forget how important Foster's Clarice is to the precision balance of this drama. Without a worthy adversary/love object, Hannibal wouldn't be quite so impressive.",10,0,2,8 June 2001
