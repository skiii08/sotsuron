It," People Don't Seem To Get That This Was Terrible
","I hated this movie.I can't be arsed to go into too much detail. I'll just give my general impressions.This movie was marketed as having been adapted from Stephen King's modern classic 'It.' It was about seven children who come together one summer to overcome both their unique personal challenges, and a supernatural monster in their town that feeds on kids every 27 years. It's a brilliant story, a passionate giant of a book.This movie reduces it into a typical, clichÃ©-ridden, unintelligent, and very bland horror film.Taken on its own, and without any expectations, it is a fairly decent throwaway popcorn-flick to entertain teenagers. The photography is good. The writing is extremely superficial but still has a thin arc. The special effects are okay. And the jump-scares are amusing for some people.Taken as an adaptation of the novel, it's an abomination. There is so little character development that by the end of the movie, you can barely tell one character from another. You don't care about any of them because you don't get to know them. They are all contrived cardboard cutouts, and this very much includes the villain 'Pennywise' who looks ridiculous, and is reduced to a one-dimensional boogeyman whose existence and motivation is never explained.The jump scares never end. What the film calls 'horror' is an extremely cheap bunch of sound-blasts along with startling close-ups of the handful of mediocre monsters.The general feel of this movie was one that was written and directed by people who had no idea what the original story they'd adapted this from was about; they just cherry-picked a handful of superficial details (a very few of which I must admit they did right -- the Leper and Butch Bowers' murder) and then added in a bunch of their own ideas which were just weird and stupid (a pharmacist propositioning Beverly? Pennywise beat to death with metal pipes???).There is a very strange phenomenon going on where people seem to love this movie. I don't fully understand this except that these people don't understand what makes good cinema, and resent anyone who tries to make them aware of this. it's weird, isn't it? it reminds me of feminism, this pig-headed denial of reality. I hazard a guess that it's some weird manifestation of people in America's discontent with a republican presidency.(edit) never before in my life have I encountered a phenomenon like the almost rabid popular defense of terrible movies like 'It 2017' or 'Ghostbusters 2016.' Having a profound love of good art, I have had countless arguments with people who think I am wrong in hating these films. All of these arguments have ended in them hurling insults like petulant toddlers in a pram because their love for these rotting placental afterbirths are purely emotional.What is going on?Basically, this generation is not just getting more stupid, which is made apparent by their incapacity to recognize banal-assed filmmaking when they see it. they are also possessed of a certain narcissistic constellation of attitudes towards life that border on sociopathic. Their basic paradigm is that there is no right or wrong, and anyone who tries to force them to follow any rules at all is a bad person.Like closet Nazis, they cling to anything that promotes these sick values with a hysterical fervor. Some more, some less.That's why some people say they love these movies. Not because they are good movies, but because they promote a certain worldview of cynical selfishness and a disregard for truth and beauty. It's Leftist propaganda.",1,12,21,16 October 2017
Coraline," So Many Things Going On Here
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is simply a triumph. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out. Although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone younger than 16; there are some pretty messed-up undertones swirling around here.The first level is the craftsmanship. It raises the bar of stop-motion work to a level higher than it has ever been before. The voice acting is impeccable. And the music is haunting, inspired, and practically couldn't have been improved upon. This alone adds up to a superbly entertaining experience.The second level is the writing, which is where the real genius is. On the surface, it appears to be a story about a likable little girl who learns a lesson about appreciating what you have in life. This story is told by introducing a villain -- the Beldam -- who attempts to exploit Coraline's boredom with her family by trying to tempt her into trapping herself in an alternate world. Coraline, in true hero fashion, resists the Beldam's temptations, and all is well with the world.However, below this lies a third level, borne out in certain details. Who is the Beldam? Where did she come from? She's not quite like the villains in other fantasy worlds, like the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland or the Witch in Wizard of Oz. The Beldam is quite aware of Coraline's 'real' life outside of the fantasy one, and uses that knowledge to try and entrap her. She is not a despotic ruler of some cuddly fantasy world; she's an evil sociopath operating in OUR world. That is creepy.The paranormal overtones with the 'water witching' and the ghosts help to suggest that the Beldam is an evil spirit who is attached to the house. There are countless stories by people who have nothing to gain by lying about having been terrorized by discarnate entities that know things about them.Perhaps most creepy of all, though, is the omnipotence of the Beldam suggested by seeing her face in the real world's garden at the end. As if to suggest that Coraline has only done what she was expected to do. Again, what is the Beldam? Some personality so cunning that he/she is capable of completely controlling people without being held accountable for it.Now THAT'S f*cking scary.",10,5,6,16 July 2015
Silent Hill," Surprisingly Good, Imaginative Horror Movie
","Wow. I've been saying for a while that most horror movies made after around 2000 are bad. But this one was actually pretty good. I have never played the video game, so this is a review of the movie on its own.A spooky little girl sleepwalks out to a quarry in the middle of the night. Her hot mother chases her and saves her from plunging to her death into some hellish hallucination of what looks like a bunch of rusty catwalks above molten steel.The plot is pretty complicated, but basically the girl was adopted from this mysterious town called 'Silent Hill.' The mother, for some reason, wants to take her daughter there as a way to help her psychosis. When she does get there, she and this woman cop who followed her somehow slip into a parallel reality where this ghost town is always foggy and is constantly raining ashes. The place, it turns out, is infested with deadly and Lovecraftian things that attack them. And every few hours, everything turns dark and there are even more monsters around.The movie really succeeds in creating a creepy atmosphere. That's what I really appreciated about it. Unfortunately, the way they tied up the reasons behind this hell on earth were a bit lame.Like, it turns out that this literal Hell on Earth is some kind of fallout created by the town's former occupants. Okay, I totally buy that. But then, what exactly did they do to create a freaking tear in the very fabric of reality? An unholy combination of abominably black magic over hundreds of years, millions of incredibly horrific human sacrifices, and an already unclean location that God himself had forsaken? ... No... It's the vengeful rage of a little girl who had a crappy life and then was burned as a witch. Now this WAS creepy in a way, because yes, severe trauma DOES invite evil into the human heart. Totally buy that. Anyone is capable of turning into a monster after they've been tortured enough.But... ONE LITTLE GIRL'S SUFFERING and ONE DEMON just isn't enough energy to create a damned interdimensional glitch in the matrix. Not on this massive scale.Kill a few people? Sure. Drive quite a few people mad? Absolutely. Put together a small, messed-up death cult? Sure, I'd buy that. Haunt an isolated location? yeah totally. But they couldn't turn an entire town into a Cannibal Corpse music video populated with lethal demonic creatures. That's just absurd.That's my only gripe. But I can easily forgive that because it was an otherwise smart movie (yes I said smart -- the bar is pretty low right now), and the monsters and locations were genuinely scary.",8,0,1,15 October 2016
Pacific Rim," Somehow boring in spite of mind-blowing visuals
","I know enough about filmmaking to where I can look at a movie and have some idea of how much work had to go into making it. And right from the start, Pacific Rim is STAGGERINGLY well-produced, so much so that it blew my mind. Giant monsters tear up the Golden Gate Bridge in slow motion. Giant robots wrestle with them underwater. Funky Chinese neighborhoods rebuild around the rib bones of vanquished monsters. We see the sumptuously detailed, futuristic airplane hangars where the giant robots are built.And it starts off pretty good, too -- giant marauding monsters from a tear between dimensions at the bottom of the ocean? And the only way they can be fought is with giant robots? I actually bought that, the way they explained this at the beginning made it seem plausible -- sort of a surreal parable about man challenging the gods with his cunning. With the promise of there being even more dangerous monsters to come, I was excited about seeing the rest of it.Unfortunately, it slowly got more boring after the exposition. It wasn't the lame acting, which was good enough for a movie about giant robots. This isn't Officer and a Gentleman.No, the biggest problem was just that the monsters and the robots just looked BORING... And all VERY SIMILAR. I mean come on, you have all this money and all these top artists and animators at your disposal, yet the monsters are all these desperately middle-of-the-road 'Godzilla 1998' knock-offs with absolutely no personality. The monsters from 'Inhumanoids' were more creative and scary than these brain-dead lumps that just lumber through towns and throw slow-motion haymakers while roaring like walruses.",6,3,4,17 May 2015
American Beauty," One of the pioneering 'Evil Quirky Indie' flicks
","The cinematography is utterly impeccable, yet it still somehow has the limited-scale feel of an indie production, which makes me feel like I can trust it -- like this isn't an impersonal studio exec's cash-grab, it's an individual's honest self-expression. And the plot is about things I'd never seen before in a 'serious,' well- produced movie -- a guy jerking off in the shower? Giving up a career and smoking pot even though you have a family to support? Going after your teenaged daughter's hot blonde friend? Why, this is groundbreaking! Honest! 'Progressive!' What a commentary on the human condition! That's what I thought when I watched this when I was younger and very naive. Yet even then, it left me feeling unsettled, even disturbed.I found it disturbing because this movie isn't an honest story about the human condition, like it pretends to be. 'Ordinary People' is that movie. 'American Beauty' and other pseudo-indie flicks that began popping up in the late 90s are some kind of propaganda for being a smug, lazy *sshole, framing a character who drops his responsibilities (at his family's expense!) as a hero. When this Marxist turd came out, EVERYONE thought it was the absolute TITS. This is because the filmmakers found a way to pass off a movie about how cool it is to never grow up as high-brow art. Seriously, it's like the emperor's new clothes: Kevin Spacey jerking off in the shower, smoking pot, and going after some teenaged chick isn't really 'groundbreaking.' It's just some middle-aged guy dealing with the problems in his life by living like he's a teenager, the hell with his wife and daughter who depend on him. This is a bad message, which is the only 'groundbreaking' thing about it. You know f***ers, I can write that story too. How about a quirky indie flick called 'Edgar' that's about the titular character in middle America who kidnaps and skins children alive. Except he's the hero, played as a mild-mannered retail clerk with a snarky but gentle sense of humor by Colin Farrell. Throw in some puddle-deep moral relativism claptrap to justify his actions and you've got American Beauty's logical next step toward brainwashing people into moral retards. Also, the thing with the plastic bag in the wind being beautiful was just gay. I get it, it sounds deep and philosophical and people are afraid of being seen as dull if they don't agree. I also get that if a plastic bag in the wind is beautiful, then so is every other commonplace thing, like coffee pots and car exhaust. If everything on earth is beautiful, that robs you of the ambition to create beauty since it's already there. What a great excuse for not feeling bad about never doing anything.By extension, if everything is beautiful, then all behavior is equally beautiful. Therefore morality is subjective. Therefore anything is justified as long as it 'feels right.' What a great way to lubricate the phallus of immorality into the quivering psychic vaginas of naive young people looking for an excuse to indulge in every selfish whim, regardless of the consequences.this is why i don't like a lot of movies made since the late 90s. Like American Beauty, they frame immoral or harmful lifestyles as good or acceptable. 'Trainspotters,' all about beautiful young heroin addicts, was like this. Where have all the grown-ups gone? Sh*t like drug addiction and just giving up on your obligations is traditionally looked down on for a reason.",3,1,4,4 August 2014
Across the Universe," Stupid
","I was brought along to see this with some relatives. They had drank the Kool-Aid, like most people had at the time, that there was something necessarily interesting or profound about a garish vehicle for a musical based on a bunch of Beatles covers.The movie itself was, ehh, it more or less succeeded in what it set out to do. I mean, it really wasn't a terrible movie; the cover songs were decent, the acting was okay, and the choreography and photography and art direction all paints a superficially believable picture of some young guy's coming-of-age experience hitch-hiking around the late-60's UK.The key word is 'superficial,' though. It's all fake as hell beneath its cutesy candy coating. There's barely any sense that we're getting to know any of the characters. Every situation is just a contrived backdrop for another Beatles cover done by what sounds like an endless line of 90s alternative rock has-beens who impart a sedate, simplified feel to the classic songs.The ending of the movie is worse than just the sterile sum of its parts though. It's actually sad in a way I'm not sure the filmmakers intended: the poor guy who was at the forefront of this epic musical journey ends up doing what? Working in a damned factory the rest of his life! I got the strong impression that we are to understand that what we saw him experience will be by far the most interesting thing that happens to him in his entire life, while everyone else seems to continue with their little adventures.",4,1,2,16 August 2015
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Gay And Oh-So-Quirky With Not Much Substance
","This movie tries to be 'quirky' because it's a romance with two crazy people. The problem is that these people are so nuts that they don't need to date each other, they need case workers.Look, I can identify with Jim Carrey's character. I like to sketch weird drawings that don't make sense to anyone, and I'm not the smoothest operator in life. But this guy is so retarded that it's irresponsible to present him as a potential date for ANY chick. He sits cross-legged on the ground in public drawing in his sketchpad, he dresses like a damned fifteen year old girl with Aspergers syndrome, and he lives in his own world. He doesn't need a girlfriend, he needs someone to teach him that some of his behaviors are not helping him in life at all. Like a 'big brother' for adults. The script should have known that.Winslet's character is a wolf in sheep's clothing, a damaged slut who would not just quickly tire of a boring nerd like Carrey and cheat on him once, but over and over again. She'll probably keep whoring it up until she's too old and/or diseased to make that work for her, and then she'll live with a lot of cats. Many people think this is 'progressive,' but it's really just the cultural equivalent of a Thalidomide baby: a nasty mutation that doesn't do anyone any good.The script should have known this, too. I hate how this movie unironically presents me with this 'quirky' love story like it's doing me a favor, when all it's doing is trying to sell me some bullsh*t platitude about 'meeting the right person' instead of stepping back and asking why these people are such losers in the first place. That's why this movie is so popular, too, because people are idiots who agree with its pretension that 'weird' people just need to find other 'weird' people to have relationships with, and then they'll be happy. The scene where the kids run the machine on Carrey and steal his food and liquor was just disgusting. What a couple of spoiled turds! They were such insufferable children that I stopped caring about the movie at all, I just wanted to see something bad happen to them. Like getting raped by wolves.",4,4,8,1 November 2014
Elysium," Viva La Popolo
","I saw this in the theaters. it was larger-than-life, with plenty of exciting action sequences, special effects, and dramatic scenes. But I left with a frown. A movie should be an overall pleasant experience for ten bucks.I left with a frown because it just... I can't relate to any of this crap. No, I DON'T f***ing automatically identify tattooed ex-cons as the good guys, you presumptuous leftist nerds, I actually identify them as dangerous members of the underclass. So trying to prop them up as these unfairly marginalized angels misses my heart and splatters against the wall.Whatever, what really annoyed me about Elysium is that it was dreadfully serious about ramming some kind of message down my throat, but that message (as far as I can tell) was that class warfare would be a GOOD THING. I think this was tailor-made to be swallowed by most people because it's currently fashionable to demonize the rich and not ask questions about why the poor are poor. Economic inequality exists, but to just jump to the conclusion that diversity through force is a good thing without asking any questions as to why those two groups came to live in those circumstances in the first place? Retarded. Maybe the Earth deserves its squalor and overpopulation because stupid people are crapping out babies they can't or won't take care of. Or that there's no nuclear families. Most reviews are focusing on the plot holes. These are a little annoying (he sure is dying a long and vigor-filled death by radiation poisoning), but these don't bother me nearly as much as the pro-class-war message this gleaming multi-million-dollar behemoth is pushing.",3,1,5,13 August 2014
Mama," Top-Shelf Craftsmanship, But Cookie-Cutter Story
","Okay, so some guy goes nuts and shoots his wife. He takes his two daughters out to an abandoned cabin and is about to kill them, too, but is then stopped by a ghost who happens to be at the cabin. Great... Okay, so it was a ghost who was maybe unjustly murdered in a similar way. I can buy that.But then, even after paying some guys to look all over the place for his body, the guy's brother only finds this cabin (and the girls, who are still there) -- five years later. Really? It took you all that time? Okay, fine, whatever. So the girls are feral and apparently have been helped along by this mysterious, vengeful spirit which they call 'Mama.'The guy's brother, and his weird over-the-hill Goth girlfriend, agree to look after the children as they are rehabilitated with the help of a psychologist. Unfortunately, this spirit follows them.Cue faux-creepy dream sequences, jump scares, and the psychologist slowly uncovering the truth that The Supernatural Is Real. Turns out 'Mama' is the ghost of some violently crazy lady in the nineteenth century who died while drowning a baby she stole from a local church. There is a dream sequence showing this which is genuinely disturbing, although in a disgusting snuff-film kind of way.'Mama,' predictably, wreaks havoc on everyone involved, including killing several people with more ease than a trained assassin. Call me a parapsychology nerd, but human ghosts generally do not have this kind of power. 'Mama' slinks around and offs victims like a multi-dimensional Green Beret. This just makes it silly to me.The ending was just confusing. It's funny, everything about this movie was perfect except for the story. The acting, the photography, the music, and the editing was all incredibly seamless. But the story was bland and cookie-cutter, just another forgettable horror flick.",5,0,0,12 September 2016
The Witch," Autistic Family Drama with Horror Elements
","Just saw this at the theater. I think it is worth seeing because I just plain believed the drama playing out on screen. This is because the acting was very good. It looked beautiful (of course). And the writing was believable.Basically there's a family patriarch in colonial America who pulls up stakes at his village and tries to resettle out in the wilderness over some kind of moral/religious disagreement with the town elders. The strain of living off the land all on their own, then, is naturally no good for the friction in the family. To top it off, their isolation makes them vulnerable to a coven of witches in the forest nearby who kidnap, murder, and/or craftily turn them on one another.I'll get the flaws out of the way: the movie has an annoying, pretentious habit of lingering on certain shots for WAY too long. Yes the acting and writing is really good, I really do feel like I'm in the 1600s with this family to whom religion is the center of existence. But the camera freakin lingers on the boy Caleb getting a bandage around his chest for what feels like half an hour... On an agonizingly slow pan up to the treetops of the forest while loud and dissonant music brays like a wounded jackass... It distracts from the narrative and almost feels like a film student who's smitten with his own brilliance.Also Caleb's death scene was really stupid and drawn out. It clubbed me over the head with 'CRAZY POSSESSED CHILD HIJINX' so hard that I almost got a concussion. There's a strange feeling I got that the movie, like, makes you expect something cool to happen (like, I dunno, the mutation scenes in John Carpenter's 'The Thing'), but they never do... We just get actors acting crazy and fake blood and loud music. Kinda like a hamburger without the patty.One exception was a scene involving a crow and a bloody boob. That was clever and a little creepy.But still, the movie is interesting because it somehow rings true. It said it was based on true accounts of witches, and I believe it. Witches are not nice. They do not mean well. They are monsters who hate everything good, and Christianity is the only thing that really challenges them. There may have been a few good reasons behind the witch hunts.",4,0,4,12 March 2016
Rosemary's Baby," This Movie Is Scary
","I've always been a horror movie fan. I enjoy horror movies for their imaginative takes on the darker aspects of reality, the sh*t that everyone knows but never talks about like places where tragic events have happened inviting bad spirits, death, etc. I enjoy them, but they usually don't scare me.See, the creepy feeling that I could be possessed, like in Exorcist, is a fear that typically doesn't live outside of dreams and late-night contemplation. Getting killed by Freddy, ditto. Getting murdered by a stranger, like Jason Voorhees, is about as likely as getting hit by lightning, as long as I stay out of the wrong neighborhoods. But this movie... This is a different kind of fear, one that isn't fun. It's not that there's a secret coven of devil-worshipers victimizing people and doing terrible things. It's that the movie is so incredibly well-directed that it convinces me that such things really ARE abroad in the world, and could be anywhere. And why not? There's not a lot here that's implausible. That's the problem with this movie, it's brilliant but it leaves me feeling paranoid.",7,1,1,19 June 2014
War of the Worlds," Pretty Damned Good
","I had high expectations for this movie because I saw it was produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg. I also heard the superstar Tom Cruise was behind the thing, like it was a labor of love for him. Such talent, resources, and star power meant that this remake of the 1953 classic should be something more than an excuse to show off modern computer graphics.My expectations were actually exceeded. It's not just a top-notch, popcorn- munching hide-and-go-seek game with giant alien monsters. It's actually SCARY. Being a lifelong horror movie fan, this surprised me.I don't know how they did it, but the film somehow tapped into a primal dread of vast, unstoppable monsters. This is interesting because this is the only 'giant monster' movie I've ever seen that's made me feel this way. I literally walked out of the theater dreading to see one of those tripods on the horizon.They're the size of tornadoes. They're utterly invulnerable. And despite their size, they're stealthy and agile.I don't think it's a profound movie, but it made me fear its alien monsters. I think that's remarkable.",8,1,5,6 August 2014
Sausage Party," Reinforces A Crappy View Of Humanity
","this is yet another Bread & Circuses type of movie where whatever crass and lowest-common-denominator attitudes and values held by most 12-40-year-olds are put in a blender and regurgitated. This time it's in the form of a dippy-ass animated story about supermarket food. Specifically, the love story between a hot dog and a hot dog bun. Oh, brother.Why does everything in Hollywood have to be so damned gay now? And I don't mean 'gay' in a homosexual-bashing kind of way, necessarily (though I am sick of seeing homosexuality being put on a pedestal; I get it, some people are freaks, shut up!). I mean 'gay' in a 'banal, immature, and stupid' kind of way. The biggest 'joke' in this movie is how the men are represented by hot dogs, and the women are hot dog buns. Huh huh huh how clever HAHAHA the hot dogs are penises, and the buns are vaginas HAHAHA holy sh*t go kill yourself.This is a propaganda movie that just vomits a nihilistic, crappy view of humanity in our faces. I'll save you the trouble: -sophistication means watching an animated movie with cuss words in it -belief in God is unconditionally backwards -recreational drug use is acceptable -sexual immorality has no consequences -homosexuality is acceptable and not weird or inappropriate, ever -humans are little more than their reproductive organs, -profane horse-sht makes a good movie because we're, like, breaking the rules.I remember when I was young and thought that Atheism and Subjectivism was the neatest thing in the whole world. Then I grew up and realized that they are mostly very juvenile ideologies that have such mass appeal only because they provide a compelling rationalization for unconditional selfishness. Yeah boo God and absolute morality... retards.I'll say it now. I don't like most young people because they are the kinds of shallow-minded idiots who watch and enjoy crap like this. They bitch about how religion is brainwashing, but then they totally see the media as a religion. They never use their minds to question the f@ggot-assed bilge being foisted on them by 'entertainment' like this.This is propaganda. Good propaganda, but one that serves to kind of keep people in a state of suspended adolescence.It looked pretty good, though.",4,4,14,23 August 2016
Trainspotting," Fetishizes Youth, Heroin Addiction, Degeneracy
","Oh, it's well-crafted. I'll give it that. It weaves awful things like heroin addiction and its attendant horrors into a cutesy story that ultimately paints an irresponsibly rosy picture of being a young screw- up who's addicted to heroin.The movie gets its sweet taste from two things: a) sexy and talented young actors, and b) those sexy young actors hooking up with other sexy young actors. That's how it sells the crap underneath it: the idea that heroin addiction is just another (acceptable) alternative lifestyle. First of all yeah, young people are usually easy on the eyes. But talk to real-life drug-addicted youths, or just watch the VICE documentaries on young heroin or Krokodil addicts, and you'll see that their lifestyles not only typically render them even less visually appealing than that one guy in Trainspotting was just before he died. You'll see that real-life youth who have lifestyles like the kids in Trainspotting are flushing their budding little lives down the toilet, rendering them uglier than any physical trait could.See, real junkies are just sad and scary because they're on a slippery slope to death or getting locked up somewhere. They're also not all witty and intelligent. Trainspotting presents sordid aspects of the junkie lifestyle, but at the same time intoxicates me with these pretty people, and with the impression that everything will turn out all right for them in the end. I also think that it ignores the possibility of permanent brain, body, and psychological damage that such a lifestyle can cause.",3,17,37,13 August 2014
