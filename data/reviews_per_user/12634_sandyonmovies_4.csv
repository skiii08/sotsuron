Ghost," A love story with a lot of heart and Whoopi Goldberg.
","The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her.However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy.Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem.Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites.I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best.Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.",8,1,2,6 March 2013
This Is the End," A crude, self-mocking, hilarious attempt at an overused post-apocalyptic story
","Wow. I was expecting this movie to be funny but I never expected it to be as funny as it was. This Is the End is the best comedy to come out this year. It stars James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel as themselves. The group finds themselves in a sort of apocalypse while partying at Franco's house.The best part of the movie is that the actors play 'stupider' versions of themselves. Most of these actors have reached household name status, so it's fun to see them make fun of themselves for our entertainment. They know exactly what their fans want to see and they do it, whether it makes them look bad or not. The funniest bits are when they are making fun of each other or referencing one of their previous movies.The choice of music was selected perfectly for each scene (once you see it, you'll understand). The guest appearances of many well known actors like Emma Watson and Michael Cera add to the comedic effect. The role that Cera plays in this movie is probably his funniest yet.The most surprising part was the storyline, which I was expecting to be the downfall of the movie (as it is for most comedies). The storyline was well-written and went really well with the comedy. There was a good balance of comedy, action, character growth and those emotional scenes. Each of them had to come to terms with what was going on and accept it in their own terms. The plot wasn't mind blowing or amazing by any means, but it worked really well with the movie and the actor's performances made up for the flaws in the plot.Without the undeniable chemistry between these five friends, the movie would have suffered. This Is the End was ultimately about the relationship between these five guys, so it literally depended on the chemistry between the six actors. They are all clearly great friends and great comedians, which is what made the movie so great. The movie takes place mostly in Franco's house, so there's not much going on and it all relates back to the six friends.The movie was written and directed by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. They are behind some of the best 'weed-smoking' comedies that have come out like Pineapple Express and Superbad. The story comes from a short that they both did together back in 2007, along with Jay Baruchel, called 'Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse.' Apparently they've been wanting to do this movie for a long time but never really thought it would happen. This Is the End is probably going to become their biggest hit, so far.I highly recommend seeing This Is the End in theaters with a good group of friends. I've already seen the movie twice in the past week and it was still funny the second time. If you love just one of the six mains actors, then you'll probably love this movie.It's worth watching the entire movie just for the last five minutes.This Is the End is a great mixture of comedy, action and spoofs. The entertaining, self-mocking performances of the six main actors makes the movie worthwhile and one of the best comedies to come out in a very long time.",8,5,20,12 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Somewhat controversial but a worthy Oscar contender.
","I've never been a fan of Bradley Cooper. Sure, I've enjoyed Hangover or Wedding Crashers but he was never the main character driving the movie.Now I can say that I am a fan. His performance was touching, I felt sympathy towards his character and he made me go through Pat's mental illness with him. Cooper knew when to be serious or add the perfect punchline and make the entire theater laugh. It actually looked as though Cooper had the bipolar disorder himself, not just his character. If he sticks with dramatic roles and movies that challenge his acting abilities, I think Cooper can be up there with Robert De Niro. (Maybe) Jennifer Lawrence was also a nice surprise in this movie. After The Hunger Games, I didn't expect much out of her. Lawrence surprised me with her performance of a girl who blames herself for her husband's death and deals with it by having sex. The chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence felt real, I could see her heartbreak when Pat constantly talks about his ex-wife and how out of control she would get when she felt attacked or hurt. Watching the movie, I didn't see Jennifer Lawrence, instead I saw Tiffany, a girl who lost her husband and was figuring out her own ways of dealing with it.Chris Tucker. I've loved Tucker since I first saw him in The Fifth Element. Funny movies aside, he's actually a decent actor. Tucker stole every scene he was in. While he was more of a comedic relief for the movie, you could see the seriousness of the mental illness that his character was going through.Great supporting cast with De Niro, Weaver, Stiles and many more. I loved each character and they were each thrown into the movie where I didn't feel overwhelmed.One of the best movies to come out in 2012, without a doubt.Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a serious laugh, and some amazing performances. If not, just see it for the dance scene at the end of the movie. If that can't make you laugh then you're helpless.",9,0,2,6 March 2013
Evil Dead," Not to be confused with The Evil Dead
","The remake (or should I say reboot) of the horror cult classic was disappointing. The movie wasn't all terrible but it's just not anywhere near the incredibly horrific yet hilarious Sam Raimi version. The original was unintentionally funny, incredibly creepy, the possession is much more entertaining to watch and it stars Bruce Campbell.On it's own, the reboot is deliciously gory (if you're into that sort of thing), surprising well-acted, and includes an interesting twist at the end. (Interesting doesn't always mean good.) It lacked the humor and creepiness the original brought and was instead filled with excessive amounts of blood and gore.Evil Dead had more of an explanation to why the friends were at a random cabin in the middle of the woods. It's more than just five college friends going on vacation in creepy cabin in the middle of the woods (but seriously, how did they find this place?). That was a nice change in a genre that's full of clich√©s and unoriginality.I'm not a big fan of gore or blood at all. I can't watch any of the Saw films and I barely even watched Hostel. Evil Dead was no exception. I spent most of the film partially covering my eyes or trying to tune out the disgusting sound effects from the gore scenes. The main attraction was the gore and that was the main premise of the movie. There was nothing as good to balance it out. The original had a nice balance of gore and black humor where I could actually watch the movie in it's entirety with only covering my eyes once. That may have something to do with the $350,000 budget that they had.Jave Levy as Mia, the drug addicted sister and Shiloh Fernandez as Mia's brother David were good casting choices. They did a great job creating their own brother-sister team that differed from the original. Jessica Lucas and Lou Taylor Pucci were strong additions to the group of friends and were great as the supporting characters. The only weak person in the group was Elizabeth Blackmore, not because her acting was in any way terrible, the character was just boring and very forgetful.Evil Dead is a fun, guts and gore filled horror flick that is no where near it's predecessor. The movie will scare you (if you're a baby like me) and gleefully disgust you with it's gory scenes.As much as I found it disappointing, I would recommend at least seeing it once. 5 out of 10 stars.",5,9,20,11 April 2013
