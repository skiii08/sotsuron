Iron Man 3," One of the worst comic book movies out there
","There was nothing engaging in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. was obviously the best thing about the first Iron Man but here he just doesn't seem to care. I wasn't emotionally invested in any of the characters and I didn't feel the romance between Tony and Pepper in the slightest either. Jon Favreau was his usual unfunny self. A bad kid actor can really be the death of a movie by himself and in this movie we have a very annoying one. Unfortunately there's a lot more that's wrong with the movie besides that kid. Character motivations were the absolute caricatures of super hero movies. I mean, Tony Stark ignores Killian at a party and that is the reason that he became evil? Come on, are we supposed to believe this? Come up with something more interesting and unique, please. The dialogue between the characters was extremely poorly written, it wasn't funny and witty at all like in the first one. I laughed only once (the bit about one of the baddies throwing away his gun). Otherwise the jokes were simply cheap. The Mandarin plot twist was so bad. The film went way overboard with it, I just couldn't buy Ben Kingsley's acting in it. Also, why would you essentially sacrifice a villain of Mandarin's caliber for laughs? I was really annoyed about that, they could've made a great character out of him. Then the burning people? Luckily their clothes don't burn off though. The end fight was just so overdone, they went full Transformers on it. Usually there's only one or two Ironman suits in the fights so there's at least some tension. In the end fight there's dozens and dozens of them. Completely unexciting. All in all, the plot was clichéd and dull and the writing horrible. Something just felt to be terribly off with this film. The movie relies on its CGI battles to deliver thrills to the audience in hopes that the audience forgets about the horrid plot and dialogue. But how could we be emotionally invested in these battles if we don't care about the characters? Don't waste your time on this.",1,10,23,12 August 2013
World War Z," More entertaining and thrilling than I expected!
","World War Z famously suffered from a lot of production problems and delays but what kind of a film did we eventually get? I'm happy to say that I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good the film was. The pacing of the movie is very good, I certainly wasn't bored at any time during the movie. The movie never lets up as director Marc Forster keeps things moving on quickly. The movie basically consists of three different acts. The start of the movie in Philadelphia was really chaotic and you could really feel it. The film did a great job of portraying the panic of a sudden zombie outbreak and it was a very strong start to the movie. Then Brad Pitt travels around the world searching for a cure to the zombie outbreak and finally ends up in a medical research facility in Wales. The middle portion of the movie was perhaps the weakest (still good though!) as I especially enjoyed the ending where they have to sneak around the medical facility. The movie manages to build a lot of suspense there. Brad Pitt does a good job in this film as a retired UN investigator and newly focused family man. It's not a too memorable role but he does a good job with what he was given. Daniella Kertesz is quite memorable as the Israeli soldier. Other performances were okay, nothing too special or bad. The zombies were quite well done when there were real actors there with makeup. The CGI use was of course quite understandable in the larger scenes where there's hundreds of zombies on the screen simultaneously. There's not that much gore here which actually made the movie feel more serious. Maybe it's just that I've seen enough zombies beheaded and smashed in the Walking Dead that made me appreciate World War Z's approach. There were many places where people were acting stupidly when you really start thinking about it but that didn't really mess with my suspension of disbelief because I was really enjoying the movie. If you don't get engrossed in the movie, you could easily nitpick a lot of scenes of course. There was also some political satire in the movie with the bit about North Korea and the wall in Jerusalem. I just wish there would've been more of that.All in all, the movie could have been a bit better though. I bet there was a bit edgier film under there that was lost with all the re-shoots and production problems. Still, a very enjoyable and entertaining movie nonetheless.",8,3,6,4 August 2013
Pacific Rim," The most entertaining and fun popcorn flick this summer, the inner kid in me had a great time!
","Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim was one of my most anticipated movies this summer. And boy did the movie deliver. I was grinning like an idiot for most of the movie. The movie is just so much damn fun and it had some of the most terrific fight sequences that I've ever seen. It also had great pacing, I wasn't bored at any point in the movie. The set up in the beginning is pretty much perfect as del Toro presents the Kaijus and how the world reacted to them. After that it's just almost non-stop action. Guillermo del Toro has really crafted a believable and expansive world that is full of detail. The visual look of the film was beautiful and full of color. You can just feel the joy and passion that del Toro had for the film through the screen. The art direction and the CGI effects in this movie are really impeccable. Guillermo Navarro also did a great job with the cinematography. The camera was always right where it should've been.The practical sets inside the robots were absolutely fantastic. If they'd done those in CGI, the movie would've definitely lost something substantial. I loved how it looked and how you got a great perspective into what it would be like to be inside of that robot. The practical sets that were used throughout the movie with the CGI really grounded the experience. The CGI Jaegers and Kaijus were done terrifically and they had a tremendous sense of weight to them. There was also enough differences between the Kaijus to keep the action interesting and the battles different. Every Jaeger also had a distinct theme to it and they were really well conceived. The sound design in this movie was also great and it really added to the intensity of the film. The great epic score by Ramin Djawadi really pumped me up during the fights. Despite the movie being a big spectacle it actually had good enough characters that I actually cared and rooted for them. I didn't like the scientists though, they were a bit too eccentric and over the top for my taste. Ron Perlman was funny though because he's just awesome as a person. I thought Charlie Hunnam made for a likable hero and Rinko Kikuchi does a great job as Mako. Idris Elba really nails his role as the tough commander with a heart. The drifting sequences were visually interesting and they were used well in conveying the backgrounds of the characters. The plot is what it is but it fits a spectacle movie like this pretty much perfectly. Approach this film with the right expectations and you'll have an enjoyable time. You have to see this in the cinema while it's still there, it really adds to the experience. It's an extremely enjoyable and fun pop corn flick, my favorite of the summer blockbusters so far.",9,15,24,2 August 2013
Hot Rod," A comedy which fails to deliver on the laughs
","I hadn't seen Andy Samberg in any film before this but decided to watch Hot Rod because it was regularly popping up in some forum threads where people were recommending comedies. Man, what a massive disappointment. Andy Samberg just doesn't have the charisma or the talent to carry a movie. He's just annoying, boring and unlikable. The lines weren't delivered well and often the scenes were really drawn out (cool beans anyone?). The over the top laughing wasn't that great either. Most of the time it relies on physical comedy (Samberg failing a stunt) which is too obvious and unfunny. Then there's a lot of stuff which is just way out there, maybe they were some inside jokes between the production crew? I don't know. The film just tries too hard to be absurd and moronic to be funny. Also, what's up with that Asian guy humping the air? There were too many scenes where he was doing just that. I'm not sure who finds that funny.I also don't think there was any chemistry between the actors. I could really see that they were acting and therefore the characters didn't seem real. It is extremely rare for me to start thinking 'Yeah, that guy's clearly trying to act there'. Not the case with Hot Rod as I was constantly taken away from the movie with the horrible acting. A completely amateurish attempt at movie making.I didn't laugh once during the movie. And it's supposed to be a comedy! I have no idea why this movie has so many raving reviews on this site.",1,12,38,12 August 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," An epic of epic epicness - Scott Pilgrim absolutely delivers on its tagline!
","I hadn't seen the Scott Pilgrim comics before and completely missed the marketing and launch of this movie and therefore had no idea what to expect before seeing this film. All I can say is that I was blown away when I finally got around to watching this masterpiece. I absolutely adore this movie, Edgar Wright is a definitely a director whose films I seem to love wholeheartedly. It's a heavily stylized film so it's definitely not going to be to everyone's taste but here the style definitely helps with the substance. If you're older or don't have any history with video games, you'll more likely hate this film. It has a very distinctive style and you're either going to love it or hate it, it definitely hasn't been toned down for mass audiences. I thought it was fantastic, funny, charming and full of energy. It has a freshly inventive and boldly unique approach to film, there definitely isn't anything like this out there. From the very first shot of the SNES Universal logo and midi music playing, you know you're going to see something special. The editing and the effects were superb and appeared very seamless. The movie is endlessly creative and delightful with an impeccable focus on detail, I was grinning like an idiot the whole way. The fight scenes are brilliantly over-the-top and hilarious. The movie's pace was relentless, Edgar Wright sure knows how to use transitions properly and keep the movie going. For pretty much any other movie he pacing would likely feel way too ADD but here it fits perfectly. The visuals aren't of course everything and this movie combines it with a really clever script. The jokes are very funny, there's a lot of them and they come at you fast. The dialogue is hilarious and witty. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were very good in this and they had some good chemistry together. Cera's character was very awkward but you could really tell he means well. The love story is also very nice and sweet in a way and you could really see growth in Michael Cera's character by the end of the movie. Ellen Wong was also adorable as Knives Chang, a girl who is obsessed with Scott Pilgrim. The supporting cast is also uniformly excellent, the evil exes were especially memorable. This movie gets a definite recommendation from me and gets a full 10/10.",10,4,7,1 September 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Desolation of CGI - the Hobbit trilogy continues to disappoint
","I saw the movie in 2D because I hated the 3D HFR in the first Hobbit movie. I thought the HFR just made the movie sets look like sets instead of being part of the movie universe. I much preferred the 2D experience here and it was easier for me to try to immerse myself in the movie. Regrettably there were too many things that were wrong with the movie for me to achieve that. This movie had a budget of something like 200 million dollars, over double that of any of the individual movies of the original trilogy. Where did all that money go? To that mostly horrid CGI? There was just bloody too much of it like in the first movie. Everything looks so damn fake with the CGI slammed front and center with no artistic attempt to hide its shortcomings. For example, when Legolas starts chasing Bolg out of Laketown, even his horse is made with CGI. Why? Couldn't you afford to rent one horse? The orcs were mostly made with CGI and they weren't menacing in the slightest. The few scenes with actual actors with makeup playing the orcs were far superior. Erebor looked quite good in general with its mountains of coins and treasures but the melted gold looked unbelievably bad. Many of the actual sets in the movie were very well done and I'm really puzzled why they didn't use them more. The CGI in LOTR looked far more convincing and epic, the large establishing shots looked like grand paintings come alive. What happened here? I don't get it. It felt like I was watching a video game and I don't want to feel that way when I'm watching a movie. Granted, the original trilogy did have a bit of silly looking CGI here and there but at least it was constantly grounded by real sets. There was also some really weird editing here too. The movie is already way too long and they still include absolutely pointless scenes. For example, when Gandalf is climbing the stairs by the mountain and the ledge gives up, the movie suddenly cuts to a sweeping shot of the mountain side. Why not just stay with Gandalf, it would provide more intensity. There's many examples like this. In Mirkwood when Bilbo is snapping at the spider web they shouldn't zoom deep into the web with the camera. Stuff like this tells nothing and adds nothing to the film. This also takes time away from the character development. When one of the dwarfs oversleeps and misses the boat to Erebor, I couldn't even remember who he was and why I should care that he was stranded in Laketown. Also, the most puzzling and distracting choice in the movie was using that weird POV camera footage in the barrel scenes, it looked so utterly different that it took me out of the movie completely. The action could've been cut down significantly too. There was no real context or meaning for most of it anyway. Also, after Legolas has killed his umpteenth orc in yet another physics-breaking and miraculous way, you simply lose interest. He can apparently do anything. My feeling is that in the original trilogy the 'laws of physics' so to say were merely bent somewhat, here they're completely shattered. All of this may sound nitpicky but I'm essentially doing this because the movie didn't get me emotionally invested in it in a positive way at all.The movie wasn't particularly funny either despite its lighthearted source material, I laughed much more heartily in many parts of the original trilogy. The Gimli joke was quite funny though. There was also absolutely no memorable music in this movie and none of it moved me like much of the music did in the original trilogy. I didn't get shivers at any point of the movie.It wasn't all bad or mediocre though. Smaug was magnificent and Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job voice acting the dragon, definitely something to witness in a theater. Smaug's discussions with Bilbo were also great. Gandalf's venture into Dol Guldur was also interesting though that is mainly because Ian McKellen is such a fine actor that he can catch your attention with ease. The cameos by Peter Jackson in the beginning eating the carrot and by Stephen Colbert as the Laketown spy were fun even though I think they might've been too distracting had I loved the movie. The pacing in the movie is a bit of a mixed bag. The first movie had bad pacing because it was overly long without anything really happening. Desolation of Smaug swings the pendulum to the other end with endless action sequences pasted after another. Sure it's more exciting to watch but it was dearly missing some slower sequences to digest everything. I'm a massive fan of the original trilogy but the first two Hobbit movies simply haven't captured the epicness and magic of those movies at all. And if the Hobbit wasn't intended to feel epic, then why make it into three movies? There's also something else I don't get. The original movie trilogy adaptation established what the LOTR universe looked and felt like. Is the Hobbit trilogy still supposed to happen in that same universe? I didn't ever feel like anyone was in any serious danger because they survive crazier and crazier encounters after the next and because of that there's no tension. This wasn't the case with the originals. Huge spiders were very dangerous in LOTR, here Bilbo is just killing them off left and right. I just wish they'd taken much more liberties with the material and really placed this story into the grittier universe that was established by the original trilogy. Or maybe they should've done something completely different instead of trying to imitate the originals and coming short of them. Anything but this.",4,506,741,11 December 2013
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Bloody and Bloody Hilarious!
","This is seriously one of the funniest comedies ever. I've shown this movie to many friends and everyone's always laughing like hell with tears running from their eyes. This should've been marketed more though, I don't see why this wouldn't have been a huge financial success if more people had known about it. Oh and if (or when!) you decide to watch it, do not watch the trailer under any circumstances! It spoils the movie way too much. Now about the characters. Tucker and Dale are just so damn likable as these two clueless hillbillies. Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine act their roles so well and without these two the movie would be a whole less engaging a watch. The script and the writing in this movie is fantastic but Tudyk and Labine take the movie to a whole another level with their fantastic chemistry and impeccable comedic timing. Katrina Bowden is also great playing the more understanding college girl who's trying to defuse the situation. She was also great in Sex Drive (2008), one of my other favorite comedy movies. The other actors are also good and suit their roles well. In its core the movie is based around such a simple idea you have to wonder why this hadn't been done before. The writers clearly love horror movies so it's not so much a parody but a lovingly crafted tribute making fun of the genre's tropes. The movie works its way through the horror movie tropes so well while incorporating them to the larger story. The deaths in this movie are inventive and absolutely hilarious. I don't know if I've ever laughed that hard, I had tears running from my eyes for most of the movie. Amidst all the fun and death there are also some good albeit obvious points about first impressions and stereotypes. Despite all the gore and dying, it's still a surprisingly warmhearted movie. Besides Death at a Funeral (the 2007 British version of course) this is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen and it's a must see for comedy fans. You won't be disappointed.",10,17,19,6 August 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Great reboot of the Bourne trilogy
","I don't get the hate this movie is getting, I mean a 6.7? This movie was excellent. It had great pacing, not quite like Bourne Ultimatum but then again that film was going almost non-stop. For me the little over two hour running time went by in an instant. In Legacy there's more time for reflection and developing the characters. Director Tony Gilroy was also responsible for the screenplays of the original Bourne movies so he's been with the film series from the beginning. And it shows. The plot is very plausible, interesting and complicated in a good way. This is a more cerebral action movie than usual so you really have to pay attention as some of the dialogue is very technical. I loved it though. The movie takes place in parallel with Bourne Ultimatum which was a smart idea. I enjoyed the background story and conspiracy angle this movie had, it was very intriguing. It was also nice to see that there were some real limitations on the capabilities of the CIA search team, it made the movie feel very real and grounded.Jeremy Renner is charming and menacing as the new Bourne lead Aaron Cross, I really bought him as a professional spy and assassin. Rachel Weisz's character Dr. Marta Shearing was very well done. She acted in a realistic and very human way, being scared and bold when it was necessary. Edward Norton does a solid job as colonel Eric Byer who is tasked with cleaning up the mess Bourne left behind him. Matt Damon is only seen in a photograph but the casting is very strong even without him.There's fewer action scenes (which are very good yet again) and longer stretches of exposition and talking than in the original trilogy. I appreciated that there wasn't too much shaky cam which is common in these sort of fast paced action films. The visual style felt very clean and effective. I loved how ton of stuff was implied by little actions and mannerisms. For example, when Aaron Cross starts to count down from 100 he does it in Russian which implies that he was meant to be a spy in Russia (he speaks other languages too but that's what he went to as his first choice). There's really a huge amount of tension during the entire film. I especially loved the cabin scene in the beginning and the intense lab scene. The music or lack thereof was also instrumental in building the tension, great job there by James Newton Howard. The ending fitted well with the tone of the movie and hopefully they'll continue making this series.All in all, this is an excellent espionage thriller with a great plot, smart action and strong performances. You should really give this movie a chance, especially if you're on a Bourne marathon like I was.",9,5,8,14 August 2013
Evil Dead," Amazing thrill from start to finish
","Damn, I wish I had seen this flick in a movie theater. Fede Alvarez's re-imagining of the Evil Dead is definitely a great ride. The movie starts off with a very creepy prologue which opens up the movie seamlessly. We're then transported to the infamous cabin where we meet the main characters. They also give us a convincing and different reason for why these five twenty-somethings have to be at the cabin. One of them is trying to kick her heroin habit and she's going cold turkey. His brother is also there to help her. It's really smart because it forces them to make her stay at the cabin and also makes it difficult for the others to believe what she's saying. This setup also makes the characters more relatable because of the family dynamic. Soon after arriving at the cabin they find the familiar demonic book and all hell breaks loose. The story isn't of course anything mind-blowing but it fits this kind of a movie perfectly.The cast does their job capably conveying fear and emotion on the screen. They do nothing too memorable but they serve the movie well. The only exception perhaps being Jane Levy who plays Mia, the drug addict who is trying to go cold turkey. She's terrific in this movie, especially when she's possessed by the demon. Also a huge plus for the writers for not making the characters do anything idiotic, my suspension of disbelief wasn't really challenged at any point. I thought everything made logical sense within the context of the movie. Some might point to the scenes where the teacher is reading the demonic book out loud as dumb but I didn't feel like that at all. The teacher was obviously from a world where none of this stuff happens normally so when you see a book that tells you not to read it out loud, you might just do it out of spite. The pacing of the movie was fantastic as I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. There's no useless filler in the movie. The editing was also really good. The slow focuses on some really cringing scenes and then the quick and crisp cuts in the action sequences were really nicely done. Sound design was also fantastic and it really added to the atmosphere. The movie's stunning and fitting visuals do a great job of creating a gripping atmosphere. I was actually grasping my knuckles during the movie. A special nod to the lighting in this movie, it was fantastic and instrumental in creating the mood of the movie. The production design and look was also great. I really liked the set pieces, the demonic book and its drawings were exceptionally well done. The gore is done really well here and there's a lot of it. It's brutal and very raw. The decision to not use CGI in the film was one of the best parts of the film. It makes all the difference. The masking and make-up of the demon-possessed characters is done terrifically. It gives it a really timeless quality which couldn't be achieved with CGI. The tone of the movie was very powerful. Every scene was seemingly filled with tension and dread. I wouldn't say the movie was scary per se as much as it was gruesome, brutal and tense. It's definitely not a funny movie but it doesn't take itself too seriously.I really don't understand the people who are complaining that this movie doesn't have Ash in it (except for the short cameo after the credits) or that it's not like the original. Why would you want that? Like a good cover song, a good remake has to be its own movie. If you want the original, then go watch the original. This is a polished and very smart remake, it's just bloody good and entertaining fun. As Fede Alvarez' first full length movie, it earns high marks from me and I'm eagerly waiting for his next movie.",10,36,70,23 July 2013
Elysium," Elysium is visually gorgeous but its story and characters left me cold and disappointed
","After director Neill Blomkamp's fantastic debut film District 9 I was understandably eager to see his new sci-fi film Elysium. Unfortunately his second feature doesn't quite match up with the greatness that was District 9.Visually the film is quite stunning and it has some great cinematography when it comes to the larger shots. The CGI effects are excellent and blend in well with the environment. The Earth of the film looks very gritty, believable and lived-in and the space station Elysium has this very sterile and futuristic look to it. You could really buy it that Earth could look like this with many decades of neglect and poverty. Everything's in disrepair and in decline. The rich on the other hand have every resource available to them in their own little paradise in space. The set and production designers truly did a great job with the locations. Matt Damon is decent as the film's protagonist Max who is an ex-con now working on assembling the droids which keep order on the now overpopulated Earth. His role and the writing of his character isn't anything too special or memorable but he does what he can with it. He's just a no nonsense guy who is thrown into a difficult situation. He was also quite sarcastic and funny when he was dealing with the droids in the earlier part of the film but we didn't see this side of him at all after that. Alice Braga plays Max's childhood friend Frey with whom Max meets up again when he's an adult. I didn't feel much of an emotional connection or chemistry between them though and that hampered the film a bit. Their back story is told almost completely in sentimental flashback sequences which I didn't care for. The antagonists in this film were very one-dimensional and over the top. Jodie Foster plays Elysium's defense minister Delacourt and Sharlto Copley (who was also in District 9) plays an undercover agent named Kruger who is positioned on Earth. They're both very cliché and uninteresting. The writing of all the characters wasn't very good at all in this film and I didn't get emotionally invested in any of them. The story isn't that great either and this then also takes away from the film's many action sequences because we don't have that big a stake in them. The film starts quite strongly as it juxtaposes the situation on Earth and on Elysium to highlight the problems of social and economic inequality. Then suddenly when the action starts, these issues fade far in to the background in favor of more and more action. From the trailers and the hype I really got this impression that the film would deal with these issues in a thoughtful manner. Regrettably this is not the case with this film. A big problem with the film is also that none of the characters seems to learn anything new or change their beliefs or anything like that. A huge part of the success of District 9 was in seeing how the main character evolved after spending some time with the aliens. In Elysium the good guys are the good guys and bad guys are the bad guys. There's no complexity, nuance or subtlety in any of them. We also don't get to meet any other citizens of Elysium beside the higher up leaders like defense minister Delacourt and president Patel. It would've been interesting to see the common people of Elysium and how they react to the situation, what their beliefs are and what drives them. The writing is also a little too pointed out and heavy-handed. Some of it just made me think 'Wow, really?'. For example, at one point the CEO of the droid production company literally tells some mid-level manager not to breathe at his direction. Things also seem to happen way too conveniently to push the plot along. Then again you could say this about many films but you really start to pay attention to these things when you're not completely engrossed in the film. This film surely would've benefited from a more subtle approach. The ending was also way too simplistic for my taste.The action in this film is quite intense and it looks very impressive at times. The exoskeletons were fun and looked convincing. Then comes the shaky cam. Oh boy. It's really quite annoying and very often it's hard to see what's going on. They should've really taken a page from the Bourne movies on how to shoot action scenes. Luckily the shaky cam isn't there all the time but the action could've definitely been improved with a clearer shooting style.All in all, the film has decent action with absolutely gorgeous visuals and it moves along at a good pace. Sadly the writing, the plot and the characters aren't that interesting and it's hard to get emotionally invested in this film. It's watchable and probably quite entertaining if you're in the proper mood for it. For me, the film ultimately left me a bit cold and disappointed.",5,769,1005,9 August 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Witty and thrilling summer blockbuster with Tom Cruise in top form
","You could describe this movie as a dizzying combination of Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Source Code and The Butterfly Effect. Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. You have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. Edge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. The tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun.",10,560,688,28 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," An expected disappointment
","I didn't go into this movie expecting much so I was only mildly disappointed. The Desolation of Smaug ended in a pretty awkward cliffhanger and The Battle of Five Armies tries to pick it up from that very spot. All of the buildup with Smaug was in the Desolation of Smaug and quickly disposing of him in the beginning of this movie doesn't work from a story-telling standpoint, simple as that. Clearly there was material here for one, maybe two, great movies as many others have pointed out and chopping up the movie into three pieces and bloating it up really screws up its pacing.Legolas again defied all laws of physics and essentially became Neo and Super Mario wrapped in one in this film. If a character can do anything with no consequences and doesn't have to follow any kind of internal rules of a movie, there's no tension or drama. Shouldn't Jackson & Co understand this? Legolas wasn't the only on either, pretty much anyone could apparently kill dozens and dozens of these orcs so where's the danger? The decision to implement the antagonists of the trilogy, Azog and Bolg, as CGI characters also really flattened the whole experience because they simply don't have the kind of screen presence a real actor in makeup has. There's really no awe and weight in much of what we see. Bilbo should've been the absolute focus of this trilogy, not the sideshow he ended up as. When he's on the screen, you're actually interested. No one cares about Bard's family or about Laketown politics. The tacked on romance between Tauriel and Kili never felt organic nor fit the universe. All of it failed to generate pretty much any emotional resonance in me. The stuff works only insofar that it keeps your attention if watched in a cinema but that's as far as it goes. The serious ponderings about greed and so on don't hold much weight because we aren't really invested in the characters. The visuals were a bit better than in the previous two, it didn't felt as saturated or dipped so wholly in CGI paint, maybe they had more time now that they didn't have to invest as much effort on Smaug? In spite of the improvement, the movie still looked too much like a video game and the way Peter Jackson swirls and twirls the camera around really highlighted the fakeness of it all at times. At times the whole thing completely breaks down in scenes like when Thranduil gets four orcs trapped on his elk's antlers and then does a quad-beheading or when Legolas is running up a set of boulders that are dropping through the air. This is not light-hearted but over the top silly slapstick and well, it just doesn't work for me. The tone wanders too much from serious to utter schlock. The trilogy should've had more more funny and lighthearted moments like the ones in the original trilogy. Moments like Merri and Pippin comparing their heights after drinking the water of Fangorn and Legolas and Gimli's drinking competition and general banter. That stuff worked. Here we have the cowardly Alfrid in a woman's dress stuffing his chest with money and making it look like he has huge boobs. That's just way too much and not funny at all, he's almost like the Jar Jar Binks of this trilogy. Also, what's up with the alternate Galadriel look in this film (the same that was in the Fellowship)? I thought that was like an evil version of her that would come about if she would get the one ring and succumb under its corruption instead of what she looks like when she does magic things. I'll just keep to that original idea, I think it works better. Galadriel carrying Gandalf really weirded me out also. Does she work out a lot or something? For me the elves are all about skill and graceful finesse and stuff like that. These kind of oddities and inconsistencies are so numerous with these films that I could probably go on for hours about these. The thing is, pretty much everyone who went to watch these Hobbit movies saw the original trilogy which established what Middle Earth looked and felt like. If you're going to use a similar visual style you pretty much have to adhere to the tone and rules of the original or otherwise everyone's going to be constantly having this jarring feeling that everything's not right. The ring wraiths for example reminded me more of Final Fantasy or something like that and not the original. In the original the magic was more subtle and subdued, not banging around like in this one. It felt like my imagination was completely shut off by this film. The eagles were also really used as a deus ex machina in this, I didn't think they would risk such a dangerous frontal attack? I get it that they took part in the battle in the book but the way they portrayed it in this? I don't know. In the Return of the King I thought they were done really well as they fought the Fellbeasts in their element high up in the air but here they're bashing through army formations like it's no big deal.Time will not treat these Hobbit movies kindly, no one is going to sit down and watch the extended editions of these at one sitting unlike with the original trilogy. What a shame. It's entertaining at parts in a pop-corn-movie sort of way but again there's too much stuff that continuously keeps chipping at your enjoyment. Not really sure the pop-corn-flick style really fits in well with Middle Earth either. Oh, it would've also been nice to know what actually happened to that gold, I thought it was sort of central in the movie? I guess that's reserved for the director's cut. Anti-greed indeed.",4,10,19,26 December 2014
Prometheus," A beautiful mess
","Well, I'm disappointed. The movie started very nicely but began to fall apart after they landed on the planet. Yes, the movie is beautifully shot and it had some of the best 3D work I've ever watched in a theater. This is to be expected from Ridley Scott. But the script is just bad. Well, Damon Lindelof of Lost wrote it so maybe I shouldn't be surprised. The film raises many questions but provides very few answers. The actions of the scientists were also so baffling, reckless and irrational that I just couldn't help but shake my head for most of the movie. These guys are supposed to be smart scientists but then the mapping orb geologist gets conveniently lost, the biologist tries to pet a clearly hostile alien organism, everyone just disregards quarantine procedures and so on. Did these guys get their degrees from some online university? I don't know, maybe this is just a very crude way by Scott to imply that all humans are no better than monkeys intellectually. Particularly silly was the surgery scene where a female scientist has abdominal surgery and then just proceeds to run around for the rest of the movie. I know people do impossible things in movies but that was just preposterous. It would be impossible to walk let alone run after an operation like that. Character actions were only taken to advance to the next plot point and not to flesh out the characters. This made it so much harder to achieve the 'suspension of disbelief' that is required in these kinds of movies. In Alien the crew's actions were understandable because they were just regular towing ship pilots and mechanics, not scientists of such caliber that they're being invited to a trillion dollar space expedition. These issues make it almost impossible to feel any sympathy towards any of the crew members and therefore it diminishes the tension in the film. When everyone's acting like an irrational idiot, you don't care if they die or not. The movie was also 30 minutes too short because the characters basically never stop to discuss anything and they don't react to what happens to the other crew members. For example, no one seems to react to the female scientist running around the ship after the surgery. You'd think someone would notice the massive staples on her stomach and make a comment about it. Similar thing happened for Scott with Kingdom of Heaven but I'm not sure if this mess can even be fixed with a director's cut because of the idiotic behavior of the scientists.",3,3,6,9 July 2013
The Wolverine," It's an improvement on X-Men Origins: Wolverine but it could still be better
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine was such a horrible movie that I was a bit suspicious going into this. Now, luckily it's a lot better than that in that it's actually watchable and I enjoyed it at times. I watched it in 2D (I hate 3D) so I can't say whether the 3D effects were done well or not. Hugh Jackman is most definitely the Wolverine. He nails the role and he's really never at fault with these movies. The problems are in other areas of the movie. Rila Fukushima does a pretty good job as Yukio for a first performance. Other performances weren't anything special but not bad either. There were some quite funny bits in the movie. Loved the hotel part especially and the bar scene in the beginning. Wolverine's grumpiness worked really well in these scenes. Japan was a cool setting for the movie and offered some good possibilities for misunderstandings and so on. The bullet train action scene was also quite intense. It was maybe the highlight of the movie which was surprising as it looked a bit goofy in the trailer.The pacing of the movie was a bit off as I was wondering a couple of times about how much there was still to go in the movie. Cinematography was so-so. There was some really annoying shaky cam in the action sequences that almost made me ill. Look to the Bourne movies if you want a model on how to use shaky cam in your movie. The use of shaky cam was especially puzzling because Wolverine was fighting ninjas a lot of the time. Why wouldn't you want us to have a clearer look of that? Shouldn't it be nicely choreographed and so on? The theme of the movie was immortality and how you can have meaning despite of that. I think it's an interesting theme and I hoped they would've explored that a bit more. Then again this movie was PG-13 so maybe they couldn't do that because they didn't want to alienate the younger viewers. You could really see that they tried to keep the age rating as low as possible in the amount of blood that's in the movie. Never have so many died with so little blood being spilled. A bit of an exaggeration maybe but you get the point.The plot was only serviceable but the movie really focused more on the characters anyway. The whole world isn't at stake here and the movie takes a more intimate approach. Wolverine's arc during the movie was quite interesting as he tried to deal with his past and find new meaning for his life. The ending was a bit too cartoonish and predictable for my taste. It also deviated too much from the tone of the rest of the movie. The Wolverine is definitely in the right direction but there's still much that could be improved. The movie needs more focus and it needs to do a better job at creating an emotional connection with the characters. A higher than PG-13 rating would also be nice to see to really allow for a more interesting movie. Still, I wouldn't say I wasted two hours watching this movie.",6,2,5,1 August 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Annoyingly quirky and pretentious
","I just can't fathom why this movie is getting such good reviews. Most likely the first and last Wes Anderson movie I'm seeing. There's nothing genuine or charming in this film. There's just this forced intentional quirkiness to this film that I can't stand. It just tries too hard to be quirky and cute and ends up feeling pretentious. The line between quirky and annoying can be very thin indeed and for me this movie crossed it by a mile.The film is partly categorized as a comedy but I didn't even get a slight chuckle during the entire film. Was I supposed to? Everything's delivered deadpan and I didn't buy the dialogue between Sam and Suzy at all. Deadpan humor is good and all but you can't have everyone doing it for the whole movie. Also, I didn't like this whole idea of kids delivering adult dialogue and ended up disliking the protagonists a lot. They didn't feel like kids in the slightest so how is this whole first love between kids angle going to work here then? They're just flat and emotionally detached. All of the characters are essentially missing a human core.I also didn't buy the love story between Sam and Suzy and that makes everything else pointless. I'm supposed to think they're in love but it didn't even seem like they liked each other. Didn't care for the rest of the characters either despite there being some serious talent behind them. If there had been at least one or two there who I liked somewhat I wouldn't give this one star. Visually it was kind of interesting but without a good story and characters, what does it matter?",1,36,70,29 August 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla definitely roars
","The neat opening credits set the tone for the movie really well combining old military footage and redacted documents for great effect. This movie's approach is more serious than Pacific Rim's for example but not too much so. Visually the movie is absolutely tremendous. The beautiful cinematography conjures up some jaw dropping scenes and the CGI monsters and the destruction they cause are quite awe-inspiring. The way they dealt with the fighting between the monsters and the soldiers also made sense and really highlighted the enormity of these creatures. I'm glad they set a good part of the monster action at night so the monsters aren't always blasted front and center on the screen so we can use our imaginations to fill in the gaps. When the monsters are truly revealed, it's hard not to get chills at that point. I thought there was just the right amount of Godzilla in the film but for those who expect this to be another Pacific Rim there might be too little of the big guy.I perhaps wanted more heart from Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford Brody who was a bit generic as the movie's protagonist (though I think that's due to the script because Johnson put in a great performance in Kick-Ass). Bryan Cranston delivered the best performance in this film with great emotion as the nuclear engineer and Ford's dad Joe Brody. They also play well off each other. Elizabeth Olsen plays Ford's wife who is also a nurse but we don't really see much of her in that role despite all of the destruction around them. I have no doubt some of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor but I guess something has to give when you try to get this many characters in and keep the movie at two hours. I also wanted to see more Ken Watanabe, I thought his character was a tad under used. Then again this movie is more about how humanity overall would deal with a situation like this so it's understandable that all of the characters don't quite have the depth we might hope. Despite some of the underdeveloped characters, I did get really immersed in the movie and had chills in many places. The great sound design and rousing score together with the truly awesome visuals definitely helped there. I was gripped by the movie throughout and the buildup to the showdown in the end was expertly crafted by director Gareth Edwards. If you're looking to have a good time at the movies, Godzilla definitely fits the bill.",8,11,22,14 May 2014
