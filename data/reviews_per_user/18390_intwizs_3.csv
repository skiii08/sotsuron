The Avengers," Entertainer of the Year
","The Avengers had me lost for words. The crowd in the cinema hall was cheering on cue.There were a couple of standing ovations. Even the laughter to the on screen repartee turned synchronous. Avid readers of the Marvel series would deem that justice had been done to the characters. The scenes where Tony Stark didn't get along with the rest of the superheroes were filled with comic relief. I for one wasn't exactly a fan of Captain America before watching this movie, though I had seen him in action in the Spiderman and his amazing friends show, he wasn't as impressive as the people would deem the first ever superhero would be, but the Avengers movie gave me a whole new perspective to the character. The final scenes had people gasping in shock and awe as to whether Tony Stark would survive And the phone call Jarvis made to Pepper Potts had everyone on the edge of their seats.. Avengers- A must Watch!!",10,4,10,29 April 2012
August Rush," spirited..
",Didn't know what I was in for when I was channel surfing and ended up watching this movie.. Been a long time since I've watched something this sincere.. The wizard is a character that most people will grow to hate.. weird role for robin williams .. that too while sporting a look like billy ray cyrus ..A treat for classical music lovers.. as well as people who prefer country or alternative for that matter.. Overall must watch movie seeing as how the plot will keep you wanting more though somewhere deep down you know its destined for a happy ending.. August rush.. was truly an awesome rush..,10,1,2,23 November 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," The dark knight rises.. a necessary High!
","I wasn't expecting to be impressed. I was quite skeptical and without any expectations whatsoever when I watched this movie, because having watched the Avengers not quite long back I didn't think another superhero movie would surpass, much less meet the expectations from followers of the genre right from the golden age of comic books. But the Dark Knight went a step further and roped in a whole other generation also. This movie wasn't as dark and depressing like how the Batman character is usually portrayed. It gave moments wherein people could actually relate to the human side of the Batman. Alfred's lines were well thought out and helped audiences fathom the actual depth of all the characters. Having been an avid reader and follower of the genre.. I was let down by how much the history of Bane had been warped and distorted.. there's no mention of experiments that were done on Bane.. Then again these may be considered as minor details.. Because the plot was neatly laid out and no character was under-represented. Bane's introduction scene was lively in a twisted sort of way mostly because of the dry humor that was incorporated to his character that left the audience curious. Batman's introduction was epic as always. Portrayal of Bruce as being frail and old in the beginning of the movie made it all the more dramatic. Towards the end some were left feeling sorry for Bane, in spite of the unforgiving punches Bane threw at Batman during their first encounter in the movie- which had left people feeling sorry for the Bat and angry at the villain. So.. by the end of the movie.. me and my friend had realized that we didn't see the actors in the movie because we were so immersed in it that we couldn't even relate Cat Woman to the actress that played her much less remember her name (though we had seen her in several other movies before) nor could we see Bruce Wayne as being Christian bale.. So.. has Christopher Nolan really done a good job of immortalizing the Batman character in an other movie?.. or .. was the character already immortal leaving Nolan not having to try very hard?.. Only a follow-up movie will tell :P This much I am sure of though.. The Dark knight Rises was.. and will continue to be ..an immersive experience.. Deshi Basara!",8,1,3,24 July 2012
