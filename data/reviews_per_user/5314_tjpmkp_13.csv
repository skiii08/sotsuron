Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This movie stinks
","I went in to see Borat with high expectations and everything I read about it sounded hilarious. Wow, what a disappointment! Yes, there were parts that were funny -- some very funny -- but sitting through this movie was like watching a stretched out Saturday Night Live skit that should have been only 4 minutes long.My problem with the film was NOT that the material was often offensive. To me, the more un-PC the better -- but this was just a one-joke film.The theater I saw it in was packed and everyone was laughing, but I couldn't help but think I was witnessing the Robin Williams Syndrome where everyone laughs because they feel like they have to. Well Robin Williams is a tedious bore on talk shows, no matter how much Jay Leno guffaws like a stuck pig, and Borat just isn't funny, either, no matter the number of magazine covers or critics saying he is a comedic genius.",3,6,17,6 November 2006
Spider-Man 3," Horrible
","Most urban dwellers are familiar with, well...droppings of all manner and variety. We've seen dog, pigeons, mouse, even horse droppings littering city streets. With the opening of Spiderman 3, we now have a very good idea of what spider crap looks like. It isn't pretty.It is a tedious re-hash of the previous Spiderman movies, which were both fun, energetic outings. Yet where the first two had a great sense of joy, '3' is labored. Where the others had one evil-doer, we've got three (for most of the film). In '3', we have more fight scenes. More Mary Jane in peril. More Aunt May moping about Unclue Ben! (He's been dead for years now...get over it already!!) More! More! More! Unfortunately, it has more tedium. I can't imagine ever wanting to see this film again. Once is more than enough for '3'!",2,1,2,7 May 2007
Match Point," I liked it better when it was called 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'
","I really, really wanted to like this movie. Finally -- a Woody Allen movie that would live up to all the hype. Critics have called it 'outstanding' and his best in decades. Well, what a disappointment. The dialog, especially in the beginning, is so studied and forced as to not be believable.It's beautifully filmed and it kept my attention throughout the entire movie. What ruined the entire movie for me was the ending, which was just so completely cynical. It was such a drag to leave the theater feeling that way. And aside from everything else, it is completely derivative of Crimes and Misdemeanors, a much, much better Woody Allen film.",1,16,30,12 January 2006
Elf," Completely Forgettable
","Totally mindless movie which kids will enjoy.  From an adult point of view, it is extremely average.  If this is destined to be a holiday classic like 'It's A Wonderful Life' than we have forgotten what great films are. I can't imagine wanting to see this movie more than once.",Null,0,1,10 November 2003
Lost in Translation," Major Bore-fest
","This is a profoundly overrated film.  Good acting does not make a film great.  It is stupifyingly dull. It is to be avoided at all costs.  I have no doubt that it will win many Oscar nominations.  While I wouldn't object to it winning in the acting categories, it would be outrageous if it won for best director or best film.",1,2,5,12 January 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Exceeds Expectations
","Little Miss Sunshine (LMS) is simply an outstanding film. So often, I watch a movie with high hopes after reading great reviews from critics, only to be underwhelmed. LMS exceeded all of the great expectations I had. It's funny, touching, dramatic -- everything you want in a movie. All the actors did a phenomenal job and the script is wonderful. At the end of the movie, the sold-out audience applauded. Do yourself a favor and have a fun time at the theater. RUN, RUN, RUN to see LMS!!! It is the best movie of the year so far. It will be very hard to beat! While it is unusual for comedies to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, LMS should be nominated and should win. It's that good.",10,3,8,31 July 2006
American Beauty," What A Piece of Garbage!
","I know I am in the minority on this one, but, boy, what a rotten film! Pretentious doesn't begin to describe it.  I am supposed to be moved by some guy filming a plastic bag being blown around?  I guess anything passes for art now.Not only were most of the characters totally unlikeable, they were such heavy-handed sterotypes.  There was no growth, no depth.  Kevin Spacey is a jerk in the beginning and is a jerk in the end.  The wife is the Martha Stewart type.  The marine is the no nonsense tough guy with a secret (You could see that one coming a mile away) and the marine's wife is in a stupor cause she's being bullied by her husband.  These people were cartoon characters.It was beautifully filmed and well acted, but that doesn't make it a good film.  I had such high expectations for this film going in, and I was really annoyed at how bad it was.",1,18,41,6 October 2000
Million Dollar Baby," I Don't Get The Hype
","Very good film, but hardly 'the masterpiece' described by Roger Ebert. It is basically a very well done Hallmark Hall of Fame TV Movie. It has Clint Eastwood as a lovable curmudgeon with a heart of gold. Hillary Swank, who is terrific, plays a strong-willed survivor with a heart of gold. Morgan Freeman is cast in his usual role of a wise, quiet observer with a heart of gold. All this becomes ultimately too cloying. Perhaps I expected more because so much was written about it. A good movie, but still doesn't surpass 'Sideways' as best picture of the year. Hillary Swank should get the Oscar for her acting, however. See it, but not with your expectations too high.",3,3,8,18 January 2005
The Piano," Hideous
","This film is a hideous piece of pretentious garbage.  Nothing about this film is entertaining, and I am baffled how no one seems to notice that this films celebrates sexual harrassment.  The Holly Hunter character is forced to 'service' Harvey Kietel's character and then she begins to like it.  Is that 'art'?  I find this film totally offensive.  It's even worse than The English Patient, if that's possible.",1,27,55,5 October 2000
Shrek 2," Shrek 2 Blew
","This movie would have gone straight to video except for the fact that the producers knew that people would spend millions in the theater to make it a huge hit.  Viewers beware. You're wasting your money.This sequel has none of the original's charm, wit or warmth.  Puss N Boots was the only funny part of the film. The rest of it was just plain boring. I'm also sick of the pop culture references at every turn.  It's lame. Changing the name 'Burger King' to 'Burger Prince'?  What a stroke of genius!  Those writers at Dreamworks must have spent weeks coming up with that bit of comic gold.",2,6,15,24 May 2004
The Producers," The Funniest Movie Ever Made. Period.
","Nothing can compare to the comic genius of this film.  Mostel and Wilder are incredible together.  Their chemistry is so good, and the film is so brilliant, that I will never see the stage version of the film that is opening on Broadway.  It's impossible for Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane to duplicate on stage what Wilder and Mostel did on screen.  Impossible!",10,1,2,16 April 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Outstanding
","Forget these 'gentle, little films' like Lost in Translation or Station Agent -- this is what I call a REAL movie.  It is outstanding in every way. While I felt the first two LOTR films dragged and I couldn't get into them, this final chapter kept my interest from the opening scene.  Truly spectacular!",10,0,1,12 January 2004
Happy Feet," It Should Just Be Called: Penguins Good. People Bad
","Sorry, but any 'childrens' movie that has my daughter watching in awed delight in the first half and crying in the second half is not my kind of 'childrens' movie.Yes, like many others, I found the animation beautiful and enjoyed watching the penguins dance (although that got a little tiring after a while), but I also found the eco-message to be way too preachy. Talk about bait and switch! You would have no idea from looking at the ads that the second half was nothing more than an Al Gore screed denouncing people and their polluting ways. Ugh! It was 'An Inconvenient Truth Lite'.If you are looking for a fun film for your child to enjoy, rent Shrek, or Toy Story 2, or The Incredibles. If you want them to be depressed, feel guilty for no reason and never want to visit an aquarium again, then run to see 'Happy Feet'.",2,5,10,11 December 2006
