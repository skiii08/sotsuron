Ford v Ferrari," Historical movie about the Le Mans race of 1966
","I am old enough to remember back in 1966 when a Ford car won the 24 Hours of Le Mans car race. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) had gotten into car racing as part of the company's marketing effort for the Mustang, and Le Mans was considered the ultimate race because the cars were going as fast as 200 miles per hour over a 24 hour period. It took place not on a racetrack but on regular country roads. Ford engages sports car designer and former Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who once drove for Aston-Martin, to build them a car capable of winning the race. Shelby had retired from racing because of a heart condition, so he recruits English car racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to be the principal driver of the car, called the GT40. The film is very entertaining, the period details seemed right, and the car race scenes are excellent. It was the Oscar winner in the film editing and sound editing categories and nominated for sound mixing.
The dominant racing car up to that time was Ferrari, and the rivalry between Ford and Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) became personal after the latter rudely rejected Ford's merger proposal. Other conflicts are between Shelby and Miles, who are old frenemies, and between the two of them and the top management at Ford, especially Josh Lucas as senior VP Leo Beebe. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), then vice-president of marketing, does his best to mediate. Damon and Bale are good, but Caitrioni Balfe as Miles's wife Molly is large wasted. Letts turns in the best performance in the film as Ford trying to live up to his grandfather's legacy.",9,0,0,9 May 2020
Rocketman," musical biography of superstar
","Way back in 1998, my wife and I saw Elton John with about 18,000 other fans. We had the 'cheap' $50 seats on the side of the stage. He stayed at his baby grand piano during the entire two hour concert, so his back was turned to us, but we were only about 30 meters away from. To see his face, we had to watch the giant TV monitors. He wore a pink suit, which was quite restrained for him as opposed the costumes shown in the new movie, but the pants split and he had to change clothes. He was sober by this time and drank at least three Diet Cokes during his performance.
This film is a musical biography showing his life as a child up to the time when he went into rehab and gave up all his addictions (drugs, alcohol, sex, etc.) except for shopping. The group therapy sessions in rehab provide a framing story. Taron Edgerton is excellent as the star, and he even did his own singing. John's real name was Reginald Dwight (played as a boy by Matthew Illesley and as an adolescent by Kit Conner), but neither of his two parents (Bryce Dallas Howard, Steve Mackintosh) shows him or each other any love or affection, although he may have inherited his love of music from his father. Fortunately, he had Ivy, a nurturing grandmother played by Gemma Jones. John was a piano prodigy who attended the Royal Academy of Music. His career took off when he was still a teenager after his record label paired him with Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) to write lyrics which John put to music. Their friendship forms the emotional core of the movie, although Bernie tells John early on that he is straight. After they become successful, John Reid (Richard Madden, who played Robb Stark in Game of Thrones coincidentally) becomes John's personal manager and lover. Unfortunately, this relationship and John's addictions led John and Taupin to becoming estranged for a time. The music is excellent, of course, although some of the numbers have different arrangements than what we are used to hearing and are presented in a different chronological order that they really occurred. Although John, now 72 years old and sober for the past 28, and his husband are executive producers, this is a 'warts and all' story. I don't know how accurate the details are, although some reviewers have pointed out discrepancies with the historical record. The scenes in which characters burst into song and dance were obviously fantasies but entertaining ones.",8,1,1,7 August 2019
Knives Out," Brilliant whodunnit
","If you are a fan of the Agatha Christie-style whodunit set in a country manor or the old board game Clue, you should see this movie, which is a tribute to them. The murder victim is a best-selling crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who seems to have committed suicide the night after his 85th birthday party at his Massachusetts estate. The suspects are his dysfunctional family (Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Jaeden Martell, Katharine Langford, Michael Shannon), Fran, his housekeeper (Edi Patterson), and Marta, his nurse (Ana de Armas). Marta has a very peculiar personality trait that causes her to puke whenever she lies. A consulting detective named Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig speaking in a Southern accent based on historian Shelby Foote) is brought in to assist the police detectives (LeKeith Stanfield, Noah Segan). There are several Sherlock Holmes references. Craig and Evans are quite good, breaking out of their James Bond and Captain America roles, respectively, and the movie itself is very entertaining with some social satire thrown in. It is nominated for the Oscar in the Original Screenplay category.",10,2,10,3 February 2020
BlacKkKlansman," A Case of Identity
","Back in the 1970s, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) was the first African-American police officer and later detective in the Colorado Springs police department. Working with a Jewish-American associate Philip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), they infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan which had been trying to become respectable. Stallworth initiated the contact by purchasing a membership by mail and calling national director David Duke (Topher Grace) on the telephone. (Stallworth still carries his membership card in his wallet.) Zimmerman became involved when the situation called for personal contact and especially when Duke himself visited the local chapter. The plot emphasizes a scheme for the likable wife (Ashlie Atkinson) of a local Klan member (Jasper Paakkonen) to plant a bomb at a student rally, but comes at the expense of a romance between Stallworth and Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), a student at Colorado College in Colorado Springs and president of the Black Students Union. Harry Belafonte appears in a cameo in which his character describes a 1916 lynching that he personally witnessed, and Alec Baldwin in one in which he appears in a Public Service Announcement decrying integration, racial intermarriage, and the influence of Jews on the Supreme Court. Spike Lee directed and co-wrote the screenplay based on Stallworth's 2014 memoir Black Klansman, and he was nominated for Academy Awards in both categories and won the latter. His long-time collaborator Terence Blanchard was also nominated for Best Score.",10,3,10,9 May 2019
The Favourite," Entertaining story with historical inaccuracies
","Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) was the last Stuart monarch, but not for want of trying to produce an heir. She had 17 pregnancies, twelve of which ended in either miscarriages or still births. None of her children survived her, and only one lived as long as his 11th birthday. According to the film, she keeps 17 rabbits as pets for some solace, but this was not historically accurate. Another historical inaccuracy is that the film has her husband, Prince George of Denmark, as deceased, although he did not die until a few years after the year the film begins.
The title actually refers to two women: Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), aka the Duchess of Marlboro and Abigail Hill (Emma Stone), later Baroness Masham. The plot is driven by their struggle to be the favourite of the queen and borrows from All About Eve, and it is loosely based on historical events from 1704 to 1711, although it gives the impression that less time passes than it did historically. The movie is quite entertaining, funny, and beautiful to watch, and it was no surprise that it was nominated for Academy Awards in the director, original screenplay, production design, cinematography, and costume design categories. On the other hand, the dialogue is full of anachronisms, and the costumes are not historically accurate.
At the beginning of the film, Great Britain is in the War of the Spanish Succession with France, and their army is led by Sarah's husband, the Duke of Marlborough (Mark Gatiss). Sarah is effectively acting as regent, making policy decisions while attending to the queen's health, both physical and emotional and becoming her lover. She is allied with the Whigs led by Sidney Godolphin (James Smith), who were in favor of the war with France. Abigail, Sarah's cousin and the daughter of an impoverished nobleman, comes to the palace as a servant, but Sarah takes her under her wing. Abigail endears herself to the queen and eventually displaces Sarah as both the queen's favorite and her lover. She becomes allied with the Tories led by Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), who were opposed to the war because, not because of the cost in human lives, but because it required higher taxes.",5,2,3,9 May 2019
1917," Two soldiers on a mission
","This film is dedicated to the grandfather of the film's director and co-author, Sam Mendes (nominated for Oscars in both the director and original screenplay categories). The grandfather was a messenger for the British army in World War I and told Mendes many stories about the war. The two main characters, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), are ordinary infantrymen, both lance corporals, who are given a mission by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to deliver a message to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) cancelling an attack that is doomed to failure. (The telephone lines are not operating.) They have to walk/run nine miles through contested terrain, and some of the individual scenes are quite horrific. The film set is over the days of April 6-7, 1917. The Germans have withdrawn to pre-prepared positions later known as the Hindenberg Line, and the British are pursuing them, not knowing that the Germans have prepared traps. One of the personal touches is that Blake's older brother (Richard Madden) is under Mackenzie's command.
The film's gimmick is that it was photographed in such a way that it appears to be just two continuous takes. The break occurs when one of the main characters is hit on the head during daylight, and it is dark when he wakes up. All the other cuts were cleverly disguised. Nonetheless, this puts the film in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope in which all the takes were exactly 12 minutes, a limitation caused by using traditional film, but the cuts were disguised to give the illusion that the action was continuous. This film was the well-deserved Oscar winner in the cinematography, visual effects, and sound mixing categories.",10,1,2,9 May 2020
Parasite," Story of two Korean families
","This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film.",9,9,12,3 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Young boy in Nazi Germany has an imaginary friend
","While the main character of this film is ten years old, it is not a movie for children, being more in the tradition of Robert Benigni's 1997 film Life is Beautiful. The title character, Johannes 'Jojo' Betzler (Roman Griffith Davis) is a member of the Hitler Youth in a small town in 1944 Germany, but he is a miserable little Nazi. He earned his nickname when he refused to kill a rabbit during a training exercise and really screws up during grenade practice, being too close when the device goes off. He survives, but his face is scarred. He doesn't have friends, except for fat little Yorki (Archie Yates), so he conjures up an imaginary friend in the form of Adolt Hitler (Waiki Waititi, who also directed and wrote the screenplay). Then he finds that his mother (Scarlett Johansson, nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) is hiding a 15 year old Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house. The local members of the Hitler Youth are commanded by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who lost an eye during combat earlier in the war, and he is assisted by Alfie Allen and Rebel Wilson, but they are essentially caricatures rather than characters. (Wilson's character even claims to have given birth to 18 blonde Aryans like herself.) The local head of the Gestapo, played by Stephen Merchant, reminded me of one of the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Based on the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens, the script by Waititi won the Oscar in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. Despite the subject matter, the film's purpose is satirical and it is actually quite funny at times. While it offers no new insights into the Nazis and is not all that original (Charlie Chaplin made The Great Dictator in 1940 and Mel Brooks The Producers in 1967), it is timely because of the recent rise of Anti-Semitism.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Midway," Story of the Battle of Midway
","Although there already exists a film about this battle, released in 1976 starring Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda, the new one is actually better. All the major characters in the new film are historical, whereas the character played by Heston is fictional, and the earlier film has a totally unnecessary inter-racial romantic sub-plot. The old film began by showing the Doolittle raid, but the new one starts in Japan in 1937 at a dinner party hosted by Admiral Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) and attended by Assistant Naval Attache Lieutenant-Commander Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) in which they discuss the possibility of a war between their two countries. It then fast forwards to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid. (Doolittle himself is played by Aaron Eckhart.) The film actually focuses on Navy pilot Lieutenant Dick Best (Ed Skrein), who was one of the dive bombers who took out the Japanese aircraft carriers during the battle, and his wife Ann (Mandy Moore). Admirals Halsey and Nimitz are played by Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson, respectively, but Admiral Spruance (Jake Weber), who actually commanded the U.S. Navy forces during the battle, is given a rather short shrift. Of course, in the original film they actually had to fly real planes and use models to represent ships, but now they can use CGI, which is excellent. On the other hand, the characterizations seemed clichéd, and the film makers felt obligated to insert frequent info dumps.",7,1,1,25 November 2019
Green Book," Feel good movie about race relations
","The title refers to a travel guide used by African-Americans during the time of segregation to find safe, friendly hotels and restaurants from 1937 to 1966. In 1962, African-American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) employed Frank Vallelonga, aka 'Tony Lip' (Viggo Mortensen) to be his driver and bodyguard when his trio, which included George (Mike Hatton) on the upright bass and Oleg (Dimiter D. Marinov) on the cello, toured the American Midwest and South. Shirley suffers many indignities, and, to a certain extent, Tony can shield him. For example, the trio is employed at a country club in Alabama, but Shirley cannot eat in its restaurant so he and Tony find a BBQ restaurant down the road. Other complications are that Shirley is gay and an alcoholic. The two men bond, of course. One of the funnier scenes takes place when Tony serves Shirley friend chicken without utensils, which Shirley initially refuses because he is a fastidious eater. Overall, this is the feel-good movie of the year, although predictable and rather old-fashioned, and the two leads are excellent with able support by Linda Cardellini as Dolores, Tony's wife. One reviewer described the movie as 'The Odd Couple' meets 'Driving Miss Daisy'. It was based on a true story, and Tony's son Nick co-wrote the screenplay, which won the Oscar in the Original Screenplay category. Unfortunately, it has been a controversial winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, because many people felt that it oversimplified race relations in the United States and members of Shirley's family have objected to his portrayal.",8,0,2,9 May 2019
