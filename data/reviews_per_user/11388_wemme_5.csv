Hereditary," Gorgeous, horrific and tragic
","I've become obsessed with this film. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks after having seen it. I find it hard to talk about or pinpoint, as there are so many levels to explore in its narrative and theme.The core of this movie is the passed down trauma, pain and illness that we receive from our parents. Hereditary seems to suggest that we can't control anything in our own lives; as if something or someone else is in control of our fate, whether that be a genetic code, our social environment or... something else. Hereditary takes this idea and does what the horror genre does best; it incarnates it into a tangible monster that aims to destroy us and everyone we hold dear.As I watched this movie I was having one of the most intense cinema experiences of my life. I was clinging to my chair, shaking in my seat, gasping for air. Hereditary is not a slow, cold, silent horror movie. It's loud, it's banging, it's punching your gut repeatedly. It's graphic and raw and it doesn't flinch from the grittiest of emotions in the human spectrum. This makes the scares all the more effective, because you're overwhelmed with empathy for the characters. And as the movie was nearing its climax and I was holding on for dear life, I seem to hear the audience in the room chuckling. I could hear their exasperation as the credits rolled. That may be your reaction too, but I'd like to think that has to do with expectations going into it. more than the actual quality of the film. I don't think you should be expecting the scariest horror movie ever made.
So let's talk about the infamous ending, which seems to split audiences down the middle. Without giving anything away, I belive it to be one of the most tragically beautiful depicitions of fate and hereditary ailment ever put to screen. I especially encourage you to look at the framing of the last shot of the movie, compare it to the very first opening image, and from there I hope you can understand the choices Aster made. The following weeks after having seen Hereditary I was unbelievably frustrated. Everywhere on the internet I tried to read reviews and analyses of the film and its ending, but everyone seemed to take it so literally. If you're going into the movie completely unknowing, I'd advise you to feel the ending, experience the ending, instead of understanding it as some kind of realistic depiction. For what is film but a tool to concretize and manifest abstract concepts into gorgeous, tragic spectacles.",10,2,6,29 December 2018
Akira," You have to see it, even though you might not like it
","From start to finish, Akira was an extremely heavy and intense movie, in every imaginable way. The fast pace, the cynical story set in a cynical universe, and all the brutal violence makes Akira a very difficult film to sit through. What keeps the viewer mesmerized however, is the extraordinary animation. Every shot is breathtaking and in all the gore and cynicism, it's absolutely beautiful. Akira is a work of art and a stunning masterpiece that needs to be acknowledged and remembered (believe me, it's hard to forget the experience), but I cannot really say I liked the film, at least I didn't enjoy it, as much as I appreciated it. Even though the universe that the movie takes place in is very complex and a lot of the movie experience is trying to understand it, the underlying plot is rather simple; ultimate power is unfortunately given to someone who can't handle it and wreaks havoc. But what really stands out about Akira and makes it very likable, is that it takes so many chances, it shies away from nothing and just when you think the story can't become any more insane, it manages to surprise you again and again. The 7/10 rating is a personal compromise; Akira is absolutely amazing, but it left me feeling hollow and heavy. It's an experience no avid film-lover should miss, but I don't have the stomach to give it a higher rating. I personally find the story very lacking, but much of the imagery is incredible and will stay with me for a very long time.",7,1,3,2 June 2016
The Thing," A terrific surprise
","When my boyfriend and I decided to watch this movie, we dove into it thinking it was going to be a rather amusing, easygoing piece of classic 80's horror movie with clichés and bad effects. And that is was similar to Alien. That's all we knew and we didn't expect much. So the movie started and we giggled at the cheesy characters and bad haircuts (Kurt Russell, as always, is a gem), as you do. Then along came the scene where the dog mutated and we both fell silent in awe. Occasionally, one of us burst out saying 'WOW'. I could not have been more surprised or terrified.If you are a fan of over-the-top 80's gore effects, seen in e.g. Cronenberg movies or the Evil Dead trilogy, you are going to love The Thing. This movie went to such an extreme level of gory mutation and body horror that I can only really compare to the ending of The Fly. Yet, even if the extent to which the body horror is taken is some of the most extreme and in turn ridiculous I've seen in any movie of this kind so far, The Thing never loses its finesse. As horrific and disgusting as they are, you still always look forward to the next mutation scene, just to see what new thing they can think of next. The Thing is one of the absolutely most creative horror films I have ever seen.But The Thing was much more than just the gore. In this movie, John Carpenter once again proves he is the master of build-up. The tension, partially thanks to the skillful camera-work, never stop creeping under your skin throughout the story and never lets you stop keeping guessing. The characters themselves are unable to trust each other, and for the viewer, it never gets less obvious who you can trust or not. It manages to always keep you on the edge of your seat.The Thing only really falls short in the boring soundtrack and the flat characters with little to no personality, except for Kurt Russell, whose character is unnecessarily crass and hard to relate to as the hero of the story. But with that said, it's hard to believe the hatred the movie first got upon release (Roger Ebert, I'm looking at you!). The Thing is surprisingly enjoyable, especially for its genre, it really stands out.",8,1,3,14 June 2015
District 9," Refreshing take on sci-fi, with a disappointing third act.
","District 9 has today been out for 6 years, yet when I finally saw it, it was nothing like what I had thought it was all these years. I am so pleased to see that the alien sub-genre within science fiction has not completely stagnated (I'm guessing the Transformers-movies give this genre a bad name).The first thing I noticed about District 9 was its style of narrative. It starts in a mockumentary-like narrative, which Blomkamp slowly abandons through the movie's progression, for better or worse. I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't for the fact that he stands by the hand-held camera-work, which is a personal pet peeve of mine. Either way, I can't remember the last time I saw science fiction try something new when it comes to form. This is very refreshing, it's neatly done and it draws you in closer to the story.The first half of the movie was MINDBLOWING! I especially loved the not-too-subtle critique on racism and the treatment of refugees. What Blomkamp does here is what sci-fi is ought to always do; reflect our problems in society by mirroring it in different creatures or worlds. Also, everything that Wikus went through kept me in complete awe, despite the clichés. Copley's acting was on point and his scenes were gut-wrenching like nothing other, to the point where I had to hold someone's hand to continue watching.Sadly, however, the second half of the movie, especially the third act, results in rather epic, grand, macho-pumping action. It's not necessarily dull or badly orchestrated, but I felt like it was too simple for such a grand opening.District 9 is definitely worth a view, and I wouldn't mind it becoming a sci-fi classic. In its genre, it truly stands out. If I could give it 7,5 stars, that would be my vote.",7,0,1,5 October 2015
Mother!," Exciting chaos, slightly stale
","Mother! is a purely allegorical film. In its foundation it mixes biblical allegories into a story about mother nature. The intent of director Darren Aronofsky is completely lucid. He wants the audience to reflect on the history of humanity and its impact on our planet, as well as of how our relation to God is ultimately what makes us destroy each other and our home. There are many layers in this film however I can't say that I experience the layers to be particularly deep. Mother! is so concerned about its metaphors that it neglects in creating fully fleshed characters and doesn't contribute any poignant ideas to the conversation about climate change. Yes, we have destroyed our planet. Yes, we have an unheatlhy relation to religion. Then what? This wouldn't be an issue had it been that it didn't take itself so incredibly seriously. It comes dangerously close to being goofy at its climax.What saves Mother! is actually the ways in which Aronofsky choses to portray and visualise the metaphors. Watching the house deteriorate symbiotically with The Mother and all the visitors that arrogantly and violently storm their home was thrilling. The allegories were excellently portrayed by the actors, I think especially Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem were fantastic. Mother! is anything but boring and manages to entertain all the way through in quite a ride. It marvels technically and I celebrate any filmmaker that tries to do something new. But Mother! doesn't fail by technical marvel, it just leaves me seeking a refreshing statement in a battle it clearly wants to participate in.",6,1,1,12 January 2020
