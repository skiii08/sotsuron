Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Muppet Movie VII
","Too much like Jedi The first two movies had a darker sinister quality that was left out of the third movie.  Jedi still worked because the stand off with Vader.Moll is no Vader and Sidios isn't showing much yet.  The pod race was too predictable, there was no sexy female and not swashbuckling good guy.I know who I was supposed to root for but after that underwater scene I didn't think I needed to.  It looked like they had it all under control.",4,0,1,18 June 1999
