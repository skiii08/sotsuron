The Benchwarmers," Awful, stupid, lame, worthless, waste of time, and I'll need a thesaurus to find more synonyms for it.
","This movie was a waste of time and money. I saw it last night as an in flight movie, so was part of a captive audience and couldn't really leave the auditorium. I tried turning on my reading light once, but got comments and nasty looks from the people on the same row.Funny? If you saw the previews, you saw all of the mildly amusing moments.The guy from Napoleon Dynamite is proving that he is a one hit wonder. The other three mail actors should have stayed on things like Saturday Night Live, as they can't carry a movie either (or even a TV commercial, if you've seen Jon Lovitz trying to sell Subway lately). At least in 'The Hot Chick,' Rob had some hot chicks to surround him to take attention away from his 'acting(?)'.I know that this is a sophomoric comedy that appeals to a target audience. If your high school graduation was more than five years ago or your IQ is over 75, you are out of that group and should run away from this film. Fast.Don't waste your time renting the DVD, buying the DVD, watching it on pay per view, seeing it on HBO, or eventually seeing it on regular television. It is ninety minutes that would be much better spent picking your toenails or watching the grass grow, events that include much more talent and several more laughs.",2,0,0,29 October 2006
Enchanted," Wow. This is the most enjoyable film I've seen in years
","Excellent. This simple, sweet, family film is the best motion picture that I have seen in a long time. I am a natural born cynic, and yet I loved this movie! Amy Adams is wonderful as Giselle and deserves an Oscar nomination for the role. Her acting is fantastic, from the voice over cartoons in the beginning, through the fish out of water scenes, through the production numbers, through the emotions displayed and the dancing at the ball, to the kick butt action in the climactic fight on the outside of the skyscraper. She was wonderful! The second star, and big scene stealer, was the chipmunk. The scene where he plays both the princess and the overweight side kick to pantomime what is going to happen is hilarious.The other characters are magnificent in their parts. The prince has the required charm along with the inflated ego (Think Gaston from Beauty and the Beast). He stays in character the entire movie. The lawyer puts just the right amount of confusion and frustration into his role. Susan Sarandon shows that she could also be Cruella DeVille brought to life.This is the best family movie since the original Shrek, without all of the adult jokes from that film. It may also be the best overall movie of the last three or four years.It was strange, but the vast majority of the audience that I saw this movie with were adults. Most did not have children with them! It was an audience of adults enjoying and laughing at a pure, sweet, children's film.SHOULDN'T THAT, BY ITSELF, SEND 'HOLLYWOOD' A MESSAGE THAT WE WANT MORE FILMS LIKE THIS!!!!! I can't wait until the movie comes out on DVD.",10,7,9,23 November 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I gave it a 1 because there was no negative numbers allowed.
","This movie only got a '1' because I was unable to give it a '0.' It is the worst piece of garbage that I have had the mis-pleasure of viewing. I only went because my son loved the book and the original and whined about seeing the new version. Though it has been said before, Depp gave 'the performance of his life' playing Michael Jackson. This sick, psychotic piece of drivel should never be released on DVD or video and should be banned from this country. Though they say it is not a remake of the original film be a different interpretation of the book, it is neither. It is Tim Burton once again attempting to entertain us with his sick and demented views of life. He ruined Batman and now had taken to destroying another classic. How much blather will he be allowed to make? How soon will the worst filmmaker of his time make a movie with the worst actor and actress (Madonna and Keanu Reeves), scripted by the worst film writer (Stephen King)? Don't waste your time.",1,5,13,11 August 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The weakest of all of the Harry Potter films
","Let's be honest here: the French actress who played Fleur could not act and walked through her part, the guy who played Krum snarled through his, Ron didn't due much more than just mope and whine, and Harry just had the same dumb smile.The friendly feeling of school chums in the first few movies was gone. The intimate school set of the third film changed to a huge, forbidding and foreboding place for this one.The direction was terrible. Even Chris Columbus did a better job (and that is saying a lot).The only spark to this film was the acting of Emma Watson, who seems to have matured in the craft while her co-stars have stood still. If this were not a big budget blockbuster, she might get a supporting actress nomination just for her scene of telling off Ron on the steps after the dance.The CGI was also pretty good here.So, two good things in a film with dozens of bad ones. That does not make for a good movie. Hopefully, this director is not brought back for the next one.",2,2,4,27 November 2005
Casino Royale," Not as bad as Die Another Day or View to a Kill, but still Awful!
","Okay, as an action movie, it isn't too bad. As an espionage movie, it isn't too bad. As a Bond movie, however, it's (to use the vernacular) bloody awful.Daniel Craig is not James Bond. He cannot bring off the suave playboy. The film's apologists try to say that this is because they are showing us the development of the character. No, they are just giving us excuses because of the shortcomings of their actor. Daniel Craig belongs in the class of Stallone and Van Damme, two other men who can beat people up but could never be James Bond.This movie is not as bad as Die Another Day or View to a Kill, the two worst Bond movies ever made. It is, however, less than the Lazenby film.From the beginning action scene, which has always given us a thrill ride, I knew we were in for a yawner. This action scene is Bond shooting a man in an office and attempting to drown a man in a bathroom. Nothing spectacular or exciting.The credits, which have always featured silhouettes of often naked women with guns, was instead lousy cut-outs of fighting men and playing card images. It got no better after this.I will admit that I was not disturbed by the fact that there was little or no of the famous Bond gadgetry (at least John Cleese was not here this time as comic relief!). This did, however, bother my 13 year old son and his buddies.The general grumble and chatter of the people walking out of the theatre was not positive. There were a lot of 'okays' but no 'greats' were overheard. The dominant word would have been 'fair' or just 'ehhh.' Proper sentiment for a mediocre film.Sean Connery has nothing to worry about, the role is still his. Craig, in fact, may be the second of the one movie Bonds.",1,14,26,19 November 2006
