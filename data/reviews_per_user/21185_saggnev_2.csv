Requiem for a Dream," A masterpiece
","This is one of the best movies I have even seen. It is not an easy movie to watch - none of Darren Aronofky's movies is - but it is a brilliant, compassionate and throughout-provoking one. The story of how different people are dealing with addiction - all forms of addiction - is extremely engaging and deeply humanistic.Aronofsky's ability to empathize and make the audience empathize with the broken and flawed characters is what give this movie its beauty.Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans give memorable performances.The soundtrack, by the Kronos Quartet, is riveting and wonderfully complements the movie.",10,0,1,5 November 2013
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Not recommended for kids
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is not a bad movie. It is a bit like Ocean's Eleven only animated, which means it is okay but nothing to get too excited about. While the movie has several shortcoming, its main problem is that it is not for kids. While many animated movies contain content for adults to keep them from getting completely bored while catering mostly for the target audience - that is, kids - this movie is for adults only and kids (and by that I mean anyone under 14) will likely get bored. The story is too complex for kids to follow and there is no real action to speak of that will get kids excited. I sum, it is an okay grown-up movie for the DVD but nothing more.",7,0,11,28 November 2009
