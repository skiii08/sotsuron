E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A honest and clean critique from an avid film goer
",This is the best film every made in this genre.  Steven Spielberg has created an extremely warm and adventurous film with the view from a child's perspective. The camera angles flow with the story perfectly which in turn draws you in and allows you to be captivated throughout the entire film.  This film can be watched over and over again and every time it will make you want to be a kid again.,10,1,3,25 August 2000
