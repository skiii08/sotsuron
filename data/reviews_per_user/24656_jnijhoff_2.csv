United 93," This whole movie is based on non-truths....
","I sympathize with all families who lost people in this tragedy, but the whole event was organized, and not the work of terrorists...Do some background reading and you know why. I rated the movie a 1, not because of the movie or acting itself, but simply because the story is incorrect.Hell, how many people died there? 3-4K? Remember the Tsunami that year? What was it? 100-200-300-400K ppl that died?So IMO this movie should never have been released. Make a movie about real human tragedy, about the tsunami.This movie is based on nothing, no real facts, except the fact that planes crashed into buildings, and people died.You get no explanations about it.If you have seen the CNN coverage about this, do not watch this movie, it adds nothing,That is the real tragedy...",1,24,66,23 August 2006
The Thin Red Line," Biggest waste of acting talent in history of Hollywood
","Biggest waste of acting talent in history. With a star-cast, you would expect a lot from this movie. It disappoints in all ways possible; the only positive thing is the nice scenery.Anybody voting this above a 5 or 6 must have a dull life.There is nothing interesting at all about the movie, and besides that, there is nothing realistic about it either.A 'good' war movie, could have been with bad acting and scenery, with a slim storyline, but this movie has none of that, not even the good 'war' part.Lets hope people get some sense and start rating this movie for what it's worth - not for what they think it needs.",5,0,4,15 December 2008
