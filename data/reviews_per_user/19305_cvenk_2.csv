Skyfall," I just don't know
","I don't know what they were thinking. Maybe I had a bad copy of the movie and there was missing a lot of clips. It's just not James Bond movie. Sure it is good, but what about other facts. Wrong stuff:-Just 2 girls,-He says his BOND JAMES BOND routine just once,-film, does not begin with the barrel shot,-maybe just two good jokes in 2:20h of the whole movie,-no gadgets (what the******),-no cool cars or some sort of new entertaining stuff,-no standard line : vodka Martini shaken not.... The movie has a good beginning and the middle is fine, but the end is not for me. The end is to long and not so much BOND. Sorry but it is NOT a James Bond movie.",7,6,15,31 October 2012
