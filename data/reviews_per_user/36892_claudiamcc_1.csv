Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," To me,it was hilarious.I don't know why everyone hated it.
","I've read loads of comments on IMDb that hated the movie for its strong crude humour,discrimination of Jews and Gypsies,and grossness. I don't care if lots of Americans didn't like it,I actually thought Borat,who was played by Sasha Baron Cohen,was a hilarious scream who was trying to prove to America that we all need to have a good laugh at something every now and then and learn to not take everything so seriously ALL THE TIME.Don't get me wrong,even I thought Borat was a freak at first when the movie came out in theaters.But when I got the film on DVD,I laughed so hard because everything in the movie throughout was brilliant though not intelligent.Borat was better than Jackass.The stunt guys in Jackass were,well,jackasses.Sasha Baren Cohen has incredible comedic talent, he's the funniest actor I've seen in years,though I liked Jim Carrey as well,I think the actor who played Borat was pure genius in comedy. The American characters in the movie weren't that amusingly funny,but so far Borat made the movie funnier.One thing that surprised me was Sasha Baren Cohen got hundreds of lawsuits from people in the movie for being filmed unexpectedly and humiliation of Kazacstan,and there's also been a controversy about Borats comment in the movie about the war in Iraq.But Borat is a character who in the story is politically incorrect in a hilarious way.So I say it's okay to laugh at an un-PC movie.",10,4,6,27 March 2008
