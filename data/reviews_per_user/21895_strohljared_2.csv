The New World," pretty movie, but not worth watching more than once
","the movie is gorgeous. all i can really say. the acting wasn't that great. certain parts seemed superfluous. i wouldn't buy this movie, nor would i pay to see it. but if someone happens to have it, no point in NOT watching it if you haven't already. it's the story of Pocahontas, yes, but nothing like the Disney movie, so don't get excited. i didn't see it in theaters, but i feel kind of sorry for the people that did. 2 and a half hours sitting in an uncomfortable theater seat after paying a ridiculous ticket price to watch this movie is...i can't finish my sentence. don't get my tone wrong though. this movie is worth watching only once. i would never watch this movie again, though i am glad i have seen it.",5,1,1,27 December 2012
Just Go with It," It's not Old Sandler, but it's good enough
","This movie was much better than I thought it would be. I agree with all the negative things people say about it, but that doesn't change my opinion that this movie is genius. The only downside to the movie is that throughout the first time watching it I was constantly thinking 'this blonde chick can't be this stupid...', but all the hilarity that happens made up for it. I never cared for Jennifer Aniston, but i see her in a different light now after watching this. never found her sexy either. now I do. The Blonde chick (don't know her name) wasn't really a character. just the person all the hilarity revolves around. Sandler, of course, is always on his game. He's selfish and at times cruel, but under all of it he shows his big ole' heart. His interaction with the children who play in the movie is perfect. The children by the way are great. The little girl was too funny. i don't want to spoil anything, but the girl is into acting and improv in the movie, which I think makes this movie genius because YOU KNOW there is some improv going on, and not just with Sandler, but with a lot of the actors playing alongside him, including Jennifer Aniston. Nick Swardson is quirky and adds some strange humor to the table, but all in all works out. Don't want to spoil anything else, but there are two guest appearances toward third part of the film that turn things up a notch. Just think of a coconut clenched between your butt cheeks.... 8/10 for this charming movie that me and my cousin can't stop watching. It's going right on my shelf alongside with Little Nicky, Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, and many others. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go make a 'devlin'.",8,2,3,28 June 2013
