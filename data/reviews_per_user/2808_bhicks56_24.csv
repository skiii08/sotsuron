The Blair Witch Project," Hype Kills....
","Both GODZILLA and THE PHANTOM MENACE,I believe, were destroyed by hype. The former had a kicky trailer which the movie couldn't amount to and the latter was in need of script revisions and lots of them.But what separates these two examples from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is that they were big budget 'event' movies, STAR WARS especially. PROJECT, was a sleeper horror cheapie with a cool, innovative gimmick. It's supposedly the missing pieces of documentary footage left by a missing trio of filmmakers researching the legendary Blair Witch. The movie is pretty much segments of color video or black and white 8mm film. This is an interesting concept and a cool idea, but it doesn't make the movie especially scary.What attracted me to the movie in the first place was first the cool idea that attracted most film purists, and later on, the rumors I overheard. People running out of theaters and getting sick (due to, I later found out, the shaky camera movements).But watching PROJECT, especially near the end, I kept thinking of the 'directors', who didn't seem to do much but edit the movie, since the talent had to shoot the film. I imagined them laughing and rolling in a big pile of money as we were getting jipped from a promising horror movie. All this movie turns out to be is a gimmicky pseudo-documentary with noises in the woods and missing campers.I realize that it's as hard to scare the bejesus out of an audience as much as it is to make them laugh out loud and hopefully break down to the floor. And due to that consideration, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is an average horror flick, which will probably be looked back as a classic like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, due to its clever style of using video and film and its dirt-cheap budget. The actors are good with their improvisations and the ending is a true chiller.If you are curious about the film, I guess it would be worth seeing. It's better than your generic Hollywood slasher flick. But don't be prepared to be scared out of your wits. Don't expect this movie to be the scariest ever made. The scariest movie ever made is yet to BE made!",5,0,1,28 November 1999
Alien 3," The Good, The Bad, The Ugly
","I'm as much of a fan of the Alien Legacy as the next ummm fan of the Alien Legacy, but this movie is a mess! Yet, a very stylish and sometimes entertaining mess.David Fincher is one of my favortie up-and-coming directors. I shouldn't categorize him just as an 'up-and-coming' director, but after four features he doesn't seem to have the recognition he deserves. This was his first feature film, and his trademark ink-black vision is printed all over this film.Ripley finds herself on a planet full of male convicts with shaved heads. It seems like after all her battles with the infamous alien creatures, she can only get as good as this dank god-for-saken hellhole. Very few of these men (who, bizzarely enough, mostly consist of Brits) have any tolerance for her. They are 'born-again', have changed their evil ways, and have no need for women. They either shun her away or attempt to rape her. This makes the movie so bleak, it's hard to watch.But Fincher's uncanny style is so interesting you keep watching. The alien finally appears via a pet dog's stomach (cool!) and now the men are looking at Ripley to help them out. This goes to the usual shenanigans, but there are some differences. There is one cool attempt at burning the alien, which shows off that the alien can move at a rapid speed not only on the ground but also on walls and cielings. But I must go back to Fincher's style again. It's so dreadful, its absolutely hypnotic and breathtaking. The little girl from ALIENS is dead, her body naked and white in the autopsy scene. The only human lover Ripley has ever had in the series (which seems to have lasted for more than 100 years due to hyper-sleep!) is killed off by the alien. Ripley recovers from the landing ship in the beginning of the movie with one nasty, bloodshot eye (once you see it you'll know what I mean) and she has to shave her head(!) to fit in with the guys. Also the alien itself seems blacker in this film, probably due to Fincher's signature use of print on film.In conclusion, this movie doesn't amount to the first two. But that doesn't mean it's bad. It's very different, but that doesn't mean it isn't faithful to the Alien saga. It's very disturbing, but deserves a look at, especially for Fincher fans.",8,0,3,19 November 1999
Se7en," Fincher's first descend into greatness
","David Fincher's last three movies have been so individually great and unique, they all speak for their own in different categories. What he does here is take a smart, clever, and grisly script by Andrew Kevin Walker, pull down the shades and throw Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in a cinematic game that will stand with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as the greatest thriller of the 90s.  Set in a city that is almost always gray and wet with rain, this movie does have a depressing feel, but watching this film over and over again, I always feel a bit giddy, as I know that Freeman's Det. Somerset isn't going to retire so easily and that Pitt's rookie Det. Mills is going to get one heck of a first case. They are great together from the start. Neither one has much of a sense of humor, but it's funny how odd of a couple they are. Somerset is patient, intelligent, and raises his voice as much as he reveals a smile. Mills look like a young lion as he jumps into enthusiasm when he works, caring more about action than about research. The thing (and flaw) about Fincher movies is that there is hardly any women characters in them. Gwyneth Paltrow is very weak in her role as Mills' wife. She is only used for the climax in which the film is going. But the movie is such a distraction from that minor detail, it almost doesn't matter. The best sequence, hands down, is when Mills chases John Doe in his apartment, out of the window, into another building, onto a ledge, and into the murky streets of the nameless city.One very smart move the movie has is not only revealing the character a good half hour before the movie is over, but giving him a speaking part which portrays him miles high over the usual cliched killers in cliched thrillers. You'll find very new things to watch in this movie, like other Fincher masterpieces THE GAME and FIGHT CLUB.If the kids in SCREAM wanted more creative psycho killers, they got one, with murders like methodical and detailed puzzle pieces all coming to a wicked conclusion that puts everything in a bad game of jeopardy.",10,0,0,7 December 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Clearly the way to go for overkill
","After a successful tv run, t-shirts, and mocking albums, the next step is clearly a movie. I rarely watch the show, but when I do, I find myself laughing out loud as much as being annoyed.This movie is an improvement from the show, to a degree. The first 1,000 times the F-word is uttered ( and mentioned in several songs) I wanted to congratulate Trey Parker and Matt Stone for bending the rules of the MPAA and bringing the freedom of speech in movies to the edge of the cliff.But I only felt like this during the first half hour. In fact, I got tired as the F-words went from shocking to boring to annoying. It was like having your 5-year-old nephew with tourettes syndrome on your leg and yelling at you.The movie has its share of good ideas: Saddam Hussein and Satan in bed (even though you have to wonder why Hussein is used as a joke six years after the HOT SHOTS sequel), the use of Conan O'Brien and George Clooney. Also, the Winona Ryder bit featuring the voice of Minnie Driver.Though I liked the La Resistance thing, the whole war on Canada was dumb and excrutiating. Probably because it was a main plot point and hey you have an hour and a half, you might as well have some kind of story. Also the joke with Chef involved in the army is offensive (for the wrong reason) and there's a little to much going on between Satan and Sudaam. And the much-hyped scene featuring the face of Kenny wasn't so special, in fact, I was kind of disappointed.But at least Trey Parker and Matt Stone are smart enough to use the freedom of making a feature film. It could have been worst, but it could have been better.",7,1,2,24 November 1999
Batman Returns," First rule in Superhero movies: 2nd is Best!!
","While the first one was vague and virtually plotless, this second entry in the Batman franchise is lavish and darkly beautiful, putting more of Tim Burton's imagination into it.This seems like a rule in superhero movies, to make the second one the better (check out SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II and compare the two).I think all the flaws of the first one is recovered here. We don't have just one, but two intriguing supervillains. Michelle Pfeiffer, seductive and sly, as Catwoman ('hear me roar') in a slinky, leather catsuit, and Danny DeVito as a short, ugly Penguin. The details into how they become who they are is obviously implausible, but that doesn't matter.Tim Burton has alot to say of his so-called evil and gruesome characters.If you look close enough, you will see that Christopher Walken's Max Shreck is the true villain. While Catwoman and the Penguin are wronged victims out for impossible revenge. Pfieffer and Keaton are steamily sexy together, paired up with both of their alter egos. But nothing beats the kinkiness of Catwoman on top of Batman, her feline kiss, and the conversation between the deadliness of kisses and mistle toes.The adult situations and scariness of this sequel might disturb young children, so it is probably smarter to let them view the immature and pointless violence of THE POWER RANGERS.But for the grown-ups who aren't afraid of admitting the love of absurdity like this, and the sophisticated kids, this is artsy action/adventure with a soul and a brain.",9,1,2,2 December 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Decapitation has never been more fun
","One thing I liked about Tim Burton's update of the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow, is that it's not stingy with the blood. Blood is poured all over the place, but not in a revolting sort of way, but in a way that you expect. The town is so dark and spooky, you welcome to grisly beheadings of the headless horseman.Johnny Depp, in his third Burton film, is a nice Ichabod Crane. He's such a wuss, yet he walks away with his skull intact. There's alot of Burton regulars like Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken. His girlfriend, Lisa Marie, plays a very bewitching spirit in the movie. But this is Christina Ricci's first outing in a Burton film, which is surprising since their personas are at the same dark level (she is like the new Winona Ryder in the new Tim Burton movies). Equally surprising is that she plays a sweet, innocent Katrina Van Tassel.But enough with the actors. The only time actors really mattered in a Burton film was ED WOOD.The headless horseman looks great in this movie, with or without his head. He goes right in with Burton's usual gorgeously dark background. But, also, he adds a little fairy tale flavor, which you get really into. Almost entrancing.The ending is the weak point of the film. Everything comes together too quickly, yet there's a chase scene climax that involves the horseman, and that's about when you look at your watch and realize you have to go to the bathroom.This is not Tim Burton's best movie, though the setting is marvelous, there's too many characters to keep up with and his usual cartoonish scares (like the one involving the witch) doesn't make you feel anything anymore.Maybe it's Andrew Kevin Walker's script, or at least the several revisions of it, which left the story muddled and uneven. It doesn't work for this movie, yet the decapitation scenes are loads of fun (who knew there were so many ways you could chop off a head!)",7,0,0,30 November 1999
Alien," Classic Screamer
","Ridley Scott's gem from outer space, probably orbiting Earth from that origin, scared the skin out of viewers in 1979 who thought they have seen every horrible creature science fiction had to offer.They were wrong.H.R. Geiger's biomechanical demon had so many details into its habitat and reproduction process, it seemed like the acid-bleeding monster was actually alive and breathing. The story has space truckers Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, and others investigating an unidentified spacecraft (big mistake!). Hurt is attacked by something parasitic and unearthly from one of thousands of eggs incubating on the ship. The thing, which attaches itself to his face is finally peeled off and terminated. But Hurt is in a coma. Will he live? Sure! He comes out of it later and seems fine to everyone, until of course his stomach explodes unexpectedly and some alien fetus flies out and runs away. Pretty soon the crew is playing a deadly game of hide and seek with the later full-grown beast and guess which one survives! (hint: look at the star of the handfull of sequels) Critics like this original, but prefer the testosteronal, explosive ALIENS, directed by (who else?) James Cameron as the best. But I put the original one notch above because it's creepier and more haunting than the sequels. The mood is opaque and the pacing is full of tension. Alien3 captured similar essence, but lost itself in continuous religious symbolism.But not just the mood makes this flick great. The monster has influenced so much more horror into science fiction. A razor-toothed yang to the ying of past aliens like little green men with giant heads or Spielberg's crop of lovable, cuddly extraterrestrials. The set design paved way to gloomier visions of space travel, alien encounters, and the future itself. Even the claustrophobia experienced inside the spaceship (the setting of the whole movie) is echoed in DIE HARD.But even if you strip all that away you still have the honest, full-throttle scares that have made horror movie history (ie the stomach bursting, alien in the vent, and the extended second set of jaws of the alien)",10,0,1,19 November 1999
The Shining," Got horror?
","This is considered one of the scariest movies in film history. I'm not completely sure why. Sure it is very cold and leaves the audience disoriented in many great shots, but what Kubrick film doesn't? Spartacus?Every time I have seen this film, I find more things I like and more things I hate. By the way, if you have read the Stephen King book, do not see this movie! If you have seen this movie, read the book! If you have done both already, you know what I'm talking about.I am an avid fan of Jack Nicholson and he does spit out some classic lines in this movie. ' Heeeeere's Johnny! ' (where on earth did that come from?) and ' All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. '  I'm sure that was the mantra he chanted while working with the irritatingly perfectionist Stanley Kubrick.There's one thing of Jack's performance I didn't understand. Where did he go mad? One day he's joking with his wife and the next he's staring off into oblivion with cold, soulless eyes. Insanity needs some sort of explanation. It's funny how Kubrick can edit out scenes from Nicholson's growing cabin fever and leave in so many scenes of the dreadfully miscast Shelley Duvall and the unfortunately wasted Scatman Crothers doing virtually nothing.One member of the cast that does a wonderful job is Danny Lloyd as the moptop kid with a special gift. 'Reeeedruuum!' He is used in the movie's scariest scenes, especially the one with the two little girls and room 237. Brrrr... What keeps this movie from evolving into a horror masterpiece is that it tries too hard to be epic with so many holes to fall into along the way. There are so many moments where the viewer needs an explanation, but Kubrick is too busy trying to make you feel cold and uneasy. I still don't know what he intended for the final shot. Maybe he wants you to read the Stephen King novel yourself.",6,1,3,29 November 1999
American Beauty," Beautiful, American, and Overpraised
","There's something about AMERICAN BEAUTY that just doesn't do it for me. The cinematography is hands-down glorious and the acting is superb. Yet, there's too much dysfunction going on, it's a little cartoon-y. Or maybe that's what was intended.After all dysfunctional families in film is certainly nothing new. Maybe that was what was so tiring to watch. The film does have some great scenes of vengeance with Kevin Spacey screwing over his boss and coming out as some kind of hero or something. But the resolution is so pat and preconcieved.Poor Chris Cooper comes out as a cartoon and Allison Janney's talent is wrongfully wasted as his wife. The confrontation between Cooper and Spacey was also a little eyebrow-raising. But I loved Wes Bentley in this movie, I hope this helps his career in the future (he was great competition with Spacey).AMERICAN BEAUTY I think is too clean, too well cut for it's material. From the beginning you know the fate of Spacey's character, so there wasn't really anything to surprise you with (unless the identity of the murderer counts), so AMERICAN BEAUTY was sorta, dare I say, predictable. I guess I could say worst things. After all, it was very entertaining, very lovely, and very beautifully photographed. If only it was inspiring or gave us something new to watch, with such a grand production.",7,0,0,2 December 1999
Being John Malkovich," could this be the best film of 1999?
","Arguably, I think it is. Though everyone is probably going to sniff at the absurdity and cynicism of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, you have to agree that you have never seen anything like it. Not even close.This story is mostly about manipulation and identity crisis and it has so much symbolism of that. John Cusack is a puppeteer, a VERY skilled one at that, who likes the creations that dangle from strings under his fingers. He is the starving and depressed artist of his craft, and has his puppets, which represent real people in his life, carry out his emotions and fantasies.Even the use of John Malkovich, an excellent character actor, seems to be a perfect choice in this movie of being someone else, if even for 15 minutes (of fame perhaps?). I truly believe John Malkovich deserves an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, not only for his magnificent performance, but for having the guts of playing himself and revealing a twisted, if fictional, subconscience. One of the funniest jokes in the film is that no one knows what movie he's been in! ('I loved you in that jewel thief movie!')Charlie Kaufman deserves some kind of award for his ingenious script. Spike Jonze puts Kaufman's vision on film with such visual pizazz. Umm, I'm coming short of intelligent words to define this film. Just see it, because everyone shines, every sight gag is hysterical, the wacky AND witty dialogue is sweet music to the ears, this movie is phenomonal.It's been getting as much raves and hype(?) as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, but unlike that cinematic ripoff, this movie certainly deserves it. All of it! And as a fan of Spike Jonze's music videos, I cannot wait to see what feature film he comes up with next. The same with Kaufman's creative genious.",10,0,1,27 November 1999
Aliens," More Aliens Mean More Good, Wholesome Mayhem Stomach Churning
","The joy in watching this sequel from director James Cameron is that not only is there more aliens, but there are also more humans. This airbrushes the staple gloomy, isolated feeling of the original and gives more leadway for lively fun dialogue (see Bill Paxton) and a kind of united human togetherness.Until, that is, the aliens wipe them out.But Cameron also gives us an improvement in the series. Sigourney Weaver's Ripley wasn't more than a survivor in the first film, just like Jamie Lee Curtis was in the first HALLOWEEN. Here, though, her character has more depth and growth. She is shattered by the horiffic tragedy taken place in the first film. She still has nightmares of the slimy, carnivorous alien. She is disoriented because she has been in a hyper-sleep for 57 years. Later on in the movie though, she ultimately recovers and becomes one bad mutha to be be reckoned with! The very first strong female character in film history who isn't contradicted with sex appeal. A true-blue butch heroine.Unfortunately she is in rather comic-bookish company with a rag-tag troop of high-tech marines joing her to fight the beasts that are still in existence on a planet that has been inhabited by human colonists. The marines are all one-dimensional except for Paxton's character who goes from annoying comic relief to panicky weenie throughout the film. There is also Paul Reiser as a backstabbing employee of the evil company which wants to exploit the alien beings and Lance Henriksen, the naturally mechanical actor as Bishop, the well-meaning android, ooh I mean, 'artificial person'. But the rest of the cast is merely decoration for the intergalactic feast the hordes of aliens have later on in the movie.The action sequences vary from stimulating to boring, especially in these sad Michael Bay overkill times, but Cameron handles this masterpiece with skill and intelligence as well as explosions and gore.
' Let go of her, you... !!'  Ummm...heehee... maybe I shouldn't write that.",10,2,7,19 November 1999
Pi," Guerrilla filmmaking of mathematic nightmare
","There are many scenes that I can't get out of my head from this very smart debut of Darren Aronofsky's. Most notably is when Maximillian (played by co-writer Sean Gullette) rips open his brain. Why? Don't let me get into it, you will have to see it for yourself. I don't know how PI was thought up, but it's a dark, disturbing, and interesting creepy-crawly sort of brain stimulator. You don't have to be a math whiz to enjoy it (I am certainly not one) but at some moments it helps. This is almost a science fiction sort of thriller, in a socialistic way. You have to be a big thinker, like the main character, Max.Max is a genius, he constantly computes equations given to him by a neighbor kid in the building he shuts himself in at. He is also a mentally tortured genius, obsessed with a number he tries to calculate with his homegrown computer. He is also a weirdo, who shaves his head after too many violent headaches, which may be caused by his abnormal gift (which may had come from staring at the sun when he was a child). Odd premise, eh?But back to the number, which ultimately sets up the stage for the cyberkinetic noir/video-droned Hitchcockian thriller. The number is mythically the key to either the stock market or God. Either way, he is hunted down both by shady Wall Street henchmen and a gang of Rabbis (?) who desperately need him to compute the number for their great fortune. But Max believes he is the chosen one and searches for the numerical answer himself, even as it pulls him into an abysmal downward spiral of madness.This movie is as weird as it gets. But screw traditionalism. This is one of the most thoroughly creative and oddly developed pieces of work in modern film.",9,1,3,3 December 1999
The Evil Dead," Cabin Fever
","This is what a cult classic is all about. This movie may be shocking for its relentless gore and wicked use of a chainsaw, but you can see a great director at work.Sam Raimi, who gave us DARKMAN, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, and A SMIPLE PLAN broke out into the scene with the real cheapie and helped bring the great Bruce Campbell in schlock genre territory (where he belongs, no matter where he dwells).Ultimately, Raimi and Campbell do their best work in the faux sequel (actually it's more of a remake of this) EVIL DEAD II, but that doesn't mean this movie isn't bad. It's much more serious than the second one, with some very trendy horror elements and wicked camrea effects.
The part I hate about this movie is the end, which is a long, gory sequence that is very patience-trying and seems to go on forever. The best part is the last shot. But there are some great moments that don't appear in the second one. Like the infamous scene where the trees start attacking, almost raping, Ellen Sanweiss in the woods. Like TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (which inspired some moments in this film), this is a groundbreaking horror cheapie from a young director onto better things.If you look closely in a scene from the first NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, you will see Nancy watching EVIL DEAD on television!!",8,0,0,3 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," That's how the censors eyes were, I gather
","I happened to enjoy this film, probably because I saw it before many critics put it down. I'm a Stanley Kubrick fan, but I know when he doesn't hit his mark. He hits it here, but not dead on like, say, FULL METAL JACKET or A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.At first you wonder where this film is going. It doesn't get moving until Tom Cruise takes a walk out of the house. I felt like I was right with Cruise in the New York City set in London (what was all that about?) and though critics snuffed his performance, I thought it was more than 'decent', though Nicole Kidman had more to work with, since she had more emotions.
The thing I didn't like were the crowds around the 'exhibitions' going on in an underground society Cruise falls into. They were digitally added because Warner Bros. didn't have the guts to go with an NC-17 the MPAA had the nerve of giving this film with the uncensored 'watchers'. This completely ruins Kubrick's art. It also makes the so-called 'inappropriate' imagery more distasteful and disturbing than it actually is.There are parts in this movie that come out of leftfield (though most of them, I think, describe certain sexual opportunities and erotic fantasies) and that just adds onto the length of this long film. It does make the movie more interesting and unpredictable, but at the same time they seem unnecessary. This film has been helmed as a disappointment. Maybe it is, in Kubrick standards. Maybe this isn't the cut he intended before his untimely death. But I can actually watch and enjoy this one again and again compared to, say, THE SHINING.",7,0,0,6 December 1999
Pulp Fiction," I'm not gonna sing the same ol' praises
","I'm sure everyone has covered the obvious genius of this movie, so I'm just going to write about the little things I enjoy.I'm sure many people love to see this movie over and over again, but since I have so many things memorized (as all of you, I'm sure, Don't Lie!!) I like to space it out and look at it in a fresh way each time. Too bad it can never be as fresh as the first time, but the exhiliration and thrill is still there.It's so cool how Tarantino can put everything he loves about cult movies and throw in some very spicy international women into the brew. Not to mention surf guitar and cartoon homages and present ethnic slurs in such an inoffensive way that it shows the whole inanity and ridiculousness of it all.I also like how Quentin puts little things that you can catch brand new after 20 or so viewings. You might not have noticed (or even have cared for that matter), but in almost every scene there's a little thing going, sometimes on the edge of the screen that makes this more than a hip, ultraviolent cult fave. I like how the scene involving Christopher Walken and the young Butch. Walken almost changes every word in explaining Butch's father's death for the sake of Butch and his mother. Also at the end, if you pay attention to the extras in the resteraunt, they look like real bystanders in a hold-up.I also sometimes find myself asking questions about the characters and imagine them outside the movie. Like Rosanna Arquette and Eric Stoltz. I always imagine them getting high and cheating on each other. Not to mention Tarantino putting questions out there for us. What is in that suitcase after all?",10,0,0,15 December 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Now here's a movie that's enjoyable over and over again
","THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has recently been one of the many movies to be overplayed on a network owned by Ted Turner. This is ironic because this was a box office disappointment. How come no one saw this in theaters? Probably because there's virtually no women. And an R-rated movie with no women means no naked breasts to the guys in America.But after useless Oscar nominations and a strong audience on video, SHAWSHANK is now considered an agreeably entertaining and moving prison classic. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are perfectly cast together, probably because they are similar kinds of actors. They shine very well when the are side-by-side with another respectable actor. Look at Freeman co-star with Jessica Tandy, Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington, or Kevin Costner. Seem him hold his own in LEAN ON ME or DEEP IMPACT. Look at Robbins co-star with Susan Sarandon, Jeff Bridges, Robin Williams, or Martin Lawerence. See him hold his own in JACOB'S LADDER or THE PLAYER (among other great Altman movies). But what really makes the two relate is the fact that they are fine actors that have proved themselves in fine movies, yet we overlook them when we name living actors who we admire.If you haven't seen this film yet, you will admire the crafty ending as well as the story or ultimately, the whole movie. The characters are strongly structured and are never overshadowed by Robbins or Freeman, though those are the two to look at.The only flaw that I find irritating in this film is the mysterious disappearance of William Sadler's stutter. Did it escape prison?I have yet to see if THE GREEN MILE surpasses this beaut of cinematic storytelling, but even if it does, this is a movie to be remembered.",9,0,0,28 November 1999

The Iron Giant," What a joy
","It's such a relief to see an animated film that goes against the annoying elements of Disney: the Broadway music and songs, the irritating comic sidekicks, the heavy-handed morals. It's become such a cliche that kids aren't being entertained like they used to (don't fear TARZAN, though, a wonderful movie).I knew I was going to enjoy this movie's retro 50s-like animation immensely, but I was surprised how much more I enjoyed. The movie isn't concerned how life-like the characters are, because ultimately it's the actions that make them more realistic than how they appear.Eli Marienthal's voice is incredibly convincing as the young boy Hogarth and the title robot is the most enjoyable and friendly creature to watch since E.T. almost twenty years ago. The Iron Giant is voiced with mechanical authenticity by Vin Diesel who marvelously makes the audience not only believe but love and sympathize for this colossal metal man. There are also good (voice)performances by Harry Connick Jr. (who sounds like a cajun Bruce Willis here) and Christopher McDonald (who I was convinced was Tim Allen). One of the great moments are when Hogarth teaches his new mechanical buddy about Superman, and the Iron Giant decides he wants to be a hero.It is almost inevitable for a movie like this not to have a message, but the great thing is that not only is it a good and heartwarming message, but it isn't handed to us in a heavy and literal way. Guns are bad and they are only used for killing. Near the end I almost felt ashamed that I was starting to get a bit misty. But that doesn't matter, it only shows how great this so-called children's movie actually is!",10,0,1,14 December 1999
Trainspotting," Choose this movie
","I'm not sure if Danny Boyle, John Hodge, and Andrew MacDonald can make a movie again that has the perfect balance of sick humor, surreal imagery, grunge, drama and truth like TRAINSPOTTING again. From the likes of A LIFE LESS ORDINARY, it's a tough call.It doesn't matter if you can't get through the thick Scottish accents, you get the main idea as the film, based on the Irvine Welsh novel, goes up and down the downward spiral (like a toilet bowl?).I don't consider this a pro- or anti- drug movie. It just shows the reasons behind and consequences of heroin abuse, and that is that. Ewan McGregor is such a charming presence here, even as he goes through danky Scotland, stealing money for drugs or drugs from the hospital to trade in for money to get more drugs. Heroin is, it seems, a delictable favorite. But only because the high is so extraordinary, you don't want to come down, so you go back and forth. Addicted to it.McGregor's Renton is the flawed hero of the movie who can't get off the smack habit no matter how PAINFULLY hard he tries. He's in great company of lowlifes. The equally charismatic Johnny Lee Miller plays Sick Boy, a suave James Bond fan who puts money over his friends any time. Robert Carlyle as Begbie, a beer-swilling hothead who gets high on violence rather than heroin (he's an echo of Alex from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). Ewen Bremner as Spud, the nerdy follower who is the most luckless of the clan. Kevin McKidd as Tommy, the clean jock-type who strange enough hangs with this group of misfits even though he doesn't do drugs. Kelly MacDonald (in her first movie role) as a temptress schoolgirl who falls for Renton and is as smart as she is unusually mature.Danny Boyle gives us some very funny and psychedelic moments in this cult fave, all under thumping beats of techno and new wave British pop music. But at the same time he raises some poignant thoughts. Renton tells us to choose life, a job, a big television, washing machines, a big couch to sit on and watch mindnumbing, spirit-crushing game shows. That might not be as satisfying of a life as you wished you had, but it's much better than being forced into slavery with a needle in your arm.",10,0,0,28 November 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The Nightmare Begins
","True, I am a Freddy fan. I think you would have to be to praise A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET so highly. But this movie is so fun to watch. As a kid I got so scared of this movie, I would run out of the room while the tape was still playing (!)Now it's just a great movie to watch with some friends. The effects are kind of crummy compared to the ones in the sequel, but the scares are homemade pure. ('This is just a dream, it's all just a dream!')The acting is deliciously campy, just like the writing. I think this represents the surrealism and forgery of good dreams, but maybe I'm just saying that to cover up the flaws. But I love those lines! 'Screw your pass!' or 'This..... is God!' This classic flick also features the great Johnny Depp in his feature film debut, 'Me? Why would anyone wanna kill me?'But despite the not-so-hot acting of the young cast, Wes Craven somehow has the superior power to creep you out with just a ring of the phone or little girls jumping rope and singing. Not to mention a slimy, bass-voiced, burnt-faced Krueger who is not afraid to take your (or his own) face off with his infamous glove. The music by Charles Bernstein plays throughout the movie and literally gives you chills down your spine.I don't care how old you are or how many times you've seen this movie. You always feel a bit more comfortable watching it when the lights are on.",10,0,1,29 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," best of the trilogy
","STAR WARS, obviously the most inspired, barrier-breaking science fiction/adventure movie ever made (thus far), showed us that you could fit your three acts in three separate movies. I think the first one was spectacular, an invitation to a fantasy world unlike any you have witnessed before or since. A very good first act, a very good introduction.But EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, in my opinion, is the best in the trilogy. Why? Let me break it down:1) Yoda. What more can I say? An ancient alien midget. A wisecracking Jedi Master. Where Han Solo gives us the irony of the series, Yoda gives us the muppet-ized hilarity of it. 2) Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. The only brotha in the future it looks like, but the dude is bad. He also gets more acting skills and character conflict here than he does in RETURN OF THE JEDI.3) Han Solo and Princess Leia. It's so funny when you look at STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE, and you think that she loves Luke. Han and Leia are so cute here. Bickering, fighting, kissing, and in the end, admitting of their true feelings. And Han always knew. What a lovely intergalactic romance.4) We first learn of Darth Vader's true identity and his relation to Skywalker.5) Awesome light sabre showdown between Vader and Luke that served up what we couldn't get from Vader and Obi-Wan's confrontation in HOPE. Unfortunately, it was rehashed into an overlong, boring one in JEDI, inserted between an even more boring starship battle.6) Oh, and speaking of starship battles. There are none! I think these are the main flaw of all the film containing them. They are cool to witness for the first few minutes, but they go on and on without doing anything different or interesting within the long time.7) Luke loses his hand. Throughout EMPIRE, you feel this dark dread, but this is the icing on the cake. A lost battle of Luke's. But the war is not over.8) The set pieces are out of this world. The icy snow in the beginning. The misty, marshy swamp of Yoda's home. The heavenly blissful City in the Clouds. Even the Death Star looks better than the last one! Not to mention Darth's suit looks MUCH better, as do R2D2 and C3P0, most likely to do with the gross earned from the first one.9) There are so many cool creatures and machines here. Like the elephant-like tanks in the beginning or the llama-like creatures used for horses around the snowy desert.There is a flaw however. A very annoying one, in fact. Chewbacca moans too much! You get so tired as he goes on and on about the desperate situation. I guess it was meant to go with the ongoing dread and unease you feel throughout the film. After all, this is the ACT II, the conflict of the trilogy. Still, I believe Episode V to be the best of this trilogy. Now to see which will be the best of the first three episodes....",10,0,0,3 December 1999
Braveheart," Masterpiece with a few cracks
","It's a magnificent epic with sad trials of love and the most graphic and realistic battle scenes ever witnessed on film.But there's one thing that kept getting on my nerves.I think it was Mel Gibson. You get a different kind of feeling watching Mel in LETHAL WEAPON, probably because he was younger. You get a different feeling watching MAD MAX, probably because it was made before he was a Hollywood leading man.Here he is the older Hollywood star we are most familiar with. But he has a great talent under those charming looks, and even a great eye for directing, as witnessed here.But his blue eyes and scraggly wig kept me from believing he was the savage he was portraying. No matter how hard he tried to hide that.
The best parts of the movie are the battle scenes and the medieval Scotland authenticity. The movie sucks you in a time period that is both brutal and romantic. The supporting acting is superb, especially the breathtaking Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabelle, the ruthless Patrick McGoohan (what a great voice for a baddie!) as Longshanks and Angus MacFading, who I kept finding more interesting than Gibson, as Robert the Bruce. Catherine McCormack had a haunting beauty in the film, especially in her presence as a ghost.And, yes, Mel Gibson gives all he's got as the lead. But did he really have to bag the Princess?Oh and one more thing Mel, how about doing a movie where your wife DOESN'T DIE?!! I think you hold the record in that category already.",9,3,5,24 November 1999
Evil Dead II," Ash vs. His Hand
","Is there some bizarre symbolism going on here? or is this just an excuse to go wild with slapstick improv? In any case, I think Jim Carrey should witness this amazing sequence of physical exuberance and the showdown between a man and his own hand (perhaps Bruce and Jim can do a movie together in the near future). Just another reason that makes this movie one of the best in its genre!",9,1,1,3 December 1999
Evil Dead II," Another Case of Cabin Fever
","Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell reunite for this 'follow-up' to the goriffic hit EVIL DEAD. This is actually an improving remake of the first (pay attention to the familiarized story) that not only lets Ash 'win', but also shows what happens with a slightly larger budget (thanks in large to producer Dino DeLaurentiis's investment). We get more sophisticated special effects, including a hand with a mind of its own (one of the BEST scenes in any horror movie). If one word could describe this movie it would be GONZO. The violence can be repulsive at first, but suddenly turns a bit cartoonish and you end up looking at some twisted cross between a George A. Romero flick and a comic book.Sam Raimi is a wunderkind when it comes to his camera, and he proves it best with his tricks here, along with its predecessor. Although ARMY OF DARKNESS is too slapsticky and considered the worst of the Evil Dead Trilogy, it is still, in my opinion, a worthy look. If you see all three of the movies in order, you will see the complete idea Raimi had for this movie.
But if you don't have the patience for that, you should still give his Hollywood invasions DARKMAN and THE QUICK AND THE DEAD a look at!",9,1,1,3 December 1999
