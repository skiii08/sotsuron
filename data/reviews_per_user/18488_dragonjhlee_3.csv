Catch Me If You Can," It is incredible!!
","After I had watched this movie I was really surprised because it is a nonfiction. The real person who is the main character had lived long times ago. This movies talks about the story between a detective(Tom Hanks) and a smart criminal(Leonardo Dicafrio). This criminal is genius. He just passed the bar examination and the medical one even though he had not studied for it. Before he took these tests, he just had saw the movie which is based on the lawyer's life. And also he became the pilot of airplane company which was very famous at that time. As he was a genius, he knew how to make the fake money so, he did it in German. In his life there have been always a detective. In spite of that a detective tries to catch him, he was used to flee out except for once but, anyway, a criminal was released from prison. At the final, detective finally caught him, from that time, a criminal got a new job which to classify the fake money in the police. Yes, it is unbelievable. How could he become the one of police even though he had been a criminal? That is why i was surprised after I had watched it. While I was watching this movie I just said 'wow' and I ,indeed, wanted to be like this criminal. He is really smart so I was jealous of him. No matter what other people says, just watch this movie!!",Null,1,2,13 September 2006
Fight Club," When I watched Fight Club...
","When I just began to watch this movie, I asked what the hack are these guys doing? Because 2 main characters were laughing even though they were fighting.This movie talks about a man who finds who he is at the end of movie by finding his ego. The story is this.One day when a man came back to his home, he found his house was burning. From now on he lost everything; his home, his money and so on. But he was lucky, because at that time he met with a guy who makes the soap for living. They became the friends so he( whose home was burned) could live with a new guy. One day, they went to the club and suddenly fought. They just felt some good things in fight. So, they had decided to make the FIGHT CLUB where some guys come and fight with other guys to share their feelings. But the purpose of making this club was to make the terrorists. As the groups were made, they did terrorism; set the bomb in building, murder other people. The point of this was to kill the bad social people who has done the corruptions. However, at this time, a man( whose house was burned) did not like it because he thought it is just terrible. At the end of movie he finally found who has been his friend (who makes the soap).Yeah, his friend was himself. It was his ego. As he did not like the world, he had made and planned it everything. However he did not want to believe that his ego has done these things.What if there is my ego at somewhere? What if even i know there is my ego, I don't wanna know that I have an ego in the world? This movie asks me about it.",Null,0,2,11 September 2006
Click," this movie is so awesome!!
","Today i saw this movie with my friends... It is really funny and awesome. Before i watched it i thought its story is similar to Bruce Almighty, because this movie talks about a man(Adam Sandler) who got the universal remote control which can control whatever he wants. For example, if somebody makes noisy or annoys him, he can stop that moment by clicking the 'stop'. I like one of scenes in this movie that when his boss annoyed him, he stopped that moment and did fart on his boss' face. And then he clicked 'stop' again so his boss felt very bad even this boss complained about the food because this boss was eating something. It was so funny even though some scenes make me sad. This movie gives us something that you don't have to waste your time and take care everybody who relates with you before they disappear.",Null,0,1,10 September 2006
