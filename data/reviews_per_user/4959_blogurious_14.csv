The Avengers," Teamed up against Evil
","I still remember a while ago when I used to dream about seeing a group of super heroes teamed up against some evil engulfing the earth. Well, I guess it didn't take that long, just because I usually refuse to stop living until my dreams come true. So when that day comes, I will have the feeling I didn't have to wait my whole life for it.'The Avengers' are here and, I must say, it's a wild ride into the fantastic world. Maybe the team is not made out of my favorite super heroes, but they do come along just fine, supported by amazing special effects that, like so many, turn the impossible into reality, at least on the big screen. This movie is quite a lot of fun, especially if you like action. It's a roller coaster from beginning till the end and the story is not too shabby, either. But I do believe Tony Stark delves more and more into that self absorbing personality of his, driving me a bit nuts. As for the others, they care for the action as much and, not to be too demanding, I must admit I did enjoy the journey. Check it out.",6,4,10,1 June 2012
Men in Black 3," Maybe We're Done Now!
","It may have taken fifteen years, but we finally came to a possible closing, although any other sequel would depend on how successful this installment can be.'Men in Black III' is just what it's been since the beginning: a lot of aliens walking around in different shapes and sizes, plotting a pending attack on earth. Other than that, you get a bunch of special effects that can pretty much represent anything your imagination can fathom. It's fun, funny at times and, surprisingly, has an emotional ending. It is nice to connect the dots on some unexplained events and behaviors, but it all comes down to having a good time and enjoying your popcorn. It will hardly become a classic for me, but the franchise seems to have worked somehow.",6,2,5,31 May 2012
The Expendables 2," ...and they're back.
","Expendable is the operative word so long it relates to anyone facing the famous gang of rescuers.There's no match strong enough to circumvent their death sentence. 'The Expendables 2' is a synonym for violence and fast track revenge, containing all the ingredients necessary to keep you awake, where action is at the heart of it. The great and funny cast is back to offer one and half hour of simple entertainment to anyone who appreciates the genre and not looking for a tedious or corny message. Get in, fasten your seat-belt and enjoy the ride. There's no thinking involved here and any reason is reason enough for great stunts and mindless explosions. Not as good as the first one, but not too shabby either.",6,5,19,16 August 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Slashing the way out
","The vampire rage seems to be a long way from finished. Apparently audiences are still thirsty for blood and anything that brings back the night creature is a welcomed idea, even if that involves one of the most famous American Presidents. 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' is fist of all a nice and entertaining movie. The stunning production will leave nothing to be desired and the enveloping music makes sure that everything is wrapped up together to present a spectacle of choreographed fights and bloody action. The story is simple, trying to match whatever we know about the President and his endless fight for equality and freedom with his cooked up talent for killing a monster that is willing to take over the whole country. Fun for anyone who appreciates the genre and is still looking for more.",6,4,8,2 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Weaving the way out
","The webs of justice are sticking everywhere and the one weaving them is back more powerful than ever. The story of Peter Parker and his inner struggle to understand the past, while bearing an infinite strength to face the future has taken a different turn. It surprises and amazes. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is beautifully done and, in spite of the fact that I also love Raimi's lighter take on the bug boy's life, this next chapter has managed to get my attention with its fresher look. It doesn't really match the adult approach that Nolan was able to give Batman, but it still brings a 'je-ne-sais-quois' to the big screen. It has a lot of action, incredible swinging scenes and Garfield, as the super hero, turns out to be a great cast. He is talented enough to depict the difficult young man's life and effort to keep up with things he doesn't understand. Great fun for anyone who's willing to let go of stress to embark in a big adventure.",8,8,22,27 June 2012
To Rome With Love," Italian ride
","The genius is back for another spin around life's simple things. Woody Allen is, as I have mentioned before, one of my favorite directors for his smart way of tackling any subject and making it a pleasure to watch. 'To Rome With Love' offers not only a stroll through the wonderful city and it's amazingly beautiful spots, but also a very funny comedy of customs and delightful insights. Life itself is a spring of inspirational cues and Allen knows exactly where to step in and make the experience an intelligent ride. Fame and fortune, social concerns and the nonsensical effect of silly preoccupation about things that do not deserve the least of consideration are packed in this Italian adventure that entertains without any serious impact or damage. It's simply a lot of fun.",8,1,5,23 August 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Why oh why!
","Anything for a piece of action and a box office return. Studios seem to fret much more over what is not selling than the quality they are trying to offer. 'The Bourne Legacy' might have never have existed and viewers would have less garbage to dispose of. The story is extremely repetitive about how government controls everything while trying to never leave a trace of the mess they get themselves into. There is plenty of action on this installment but honestly nothing we haven't seen before. The movie is too long - over two hours of back and forth, parallel happenings that try to impress to deliver an open ending that certainly may inspire yet another sequel. Bourne may spend the whole movie trying to save himself, but it's the viewers who should be running away from the theater to save their pockets.",2,3,12,9 September 2012
Brave," Lame and boring.
","Judging an animation is usually as difficult as judging a child in a competition: they are always so charming and touching that anything but wonderful doesn't apply. However, when it comes to children, it's sometimes better to keep out thoughts to ourselves to avoid discouragement. As for animation, we must remember there are great and experienced artists behind it and aiming for excellence should be their one and only drive. 'The Brave' is not one of those movies that will put a beautiful smile on your face. If anything, it works more as a sedative than energy drink: the characters are quite boring and the story is even worse. There are no eye-catching performances or unforgettable lines, except for the beautiful visual and harmonious music. Other than that, it is just as bad as the idea itself. Very disappointing.",2,25,47,20 July 2012
Ice Age: Continental Drift," The ice is no longer cold
","Three years ago I believed the Ice Age trilogy had taken its final step and the results were not so compelling as the first two installments. Nevertheless, it was fun to see the characters back together for a possible closure. 'Ice Age: Continental Drift' seems to be forcing the story a bit too far, taking different directions that do not add much to what we were used to. This time we get stuck in the middle of the ocean while a crazy old monkey incarnates a mean pirate with lots of issues to resolve. The adventure, however, is a bit dull and in spite of the 3D effects, I couldn't feel the connection that I had with the two first installments. I was almost sure it should have stopped after the third part, but after seeing this one, I am now completely sure.",4,2,5,6 July 2012
Dark Shadows," Depp can't do miracles.
","That Tim Burton is a source of dumbfounded creativity is no big surprise. His touch and sensibility when dealing with amazing characters translate well to the screen, taking the viewer gently to a world of fantasy and good entertainment. However, 'Dark Shadows' - although relying on a talented and capable cast - leaves a lot to be desired. The beginning is quite enthralling, as one of those children's stories that capture our undivided attention, building up the expectations, making me believe I was in for a special treat. Boy, was I mislead. In fact, once you're through the explanation part, everything seems to die every passing minute. The story lingers on, with some passages that are pretentiously too serious for this type of comedy, while others are very silly. The combination, as a result, doesn't work well and the last minutes are noisy and messy. I was very disappointed and, at some moments, quite anxious for the final credits. I love Depp, but not even his presence could stop this boat from sinking deep.",4,0,1,31 May 2012
Prometheus," Revisiting the horror
","As a big fan of the very first 'Alien' movie, the third and fourth installment brought me nothing but disappointment, regardless of Sigourney Weaver's efforts to revive the one and only Ripley. 'Prometheus', as it should be, is a prequel to everything I always wish I could further understand: the birth of the acid bleeding monster we so much love. It's a big production that leaves nothing to be desired, from the hands of our beloved Ridley Scott. If too soon to become a classic, it should not take long to belong in that category, making me believe that, if 'Alien' was ever destined to be a trilogy, this is it. It doesn't really start with the first movie, but actually with this one. It's sleek, subtle and most of all, has the special touch of a great director who understands his craft and the passion for the story. It's great not only for the fans, but for everyone who fell in love with the franchise a long time ago. Now it's time to experience it all over again.",8,9,19,31 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The end is near!
","From the very beginning, Christopher Nolan's take on the super hero life has been an incredible journey. The adult approach to something we were used to as being a childish play turned everything upside down to reach the utmost positive effect. 'The Dark Knight Rises' puts an end to a wonderful trilogy that never ceases to impress as well as entertain. The mastery conduction by Nolan leads the audience to a climax that brings more sadness than joy. The music by Hans Zimmer couldn't be more powerful and enveloping, glueing everything together to wrap one big show that is hard not to appreciate. This is a wonderful movie, not only for the fans, but also for those who enjoy the type of action and the complicated web of power and politics, brought by sickening characters that are difficult to ignore. I can't say much more, than to recommend it as a special treat for blockbuster lovers. Fantastic.",10,1,7,20 July 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Great cast gone bad.
","I still don't know exactly what to think of this movie. It is quite exceptional in the sense that the story telling won't suffer any kind of repression, where anything is possible within their own reality. It feels like watching a play that suddenly expands physically, crossing the stage border to elope into the wild and taking the audience with it. However, the whole experience may take its toll and the anxiety for an immediate break becomes a little hard to bear. 'Moonrise Kingdom' is weird and the wonderful cast looks like a reward for having your time and attention. It is technically not long, but it feels like forever. The start is very fresh, but once you dive into the film, every minute lingers on through long dialogues that, if not adequate, make the characters sound like they're all stoned. The story line, however, can be uplifting where the main two characters prove that happiness is something to conquer and not delivered by mail. It's like a taste that you can't quite describe, but don't let my apparent cynicism stop you from experiencing it yourself",4,11,20,6 June 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Never cease to entertain
","There are very few animations that manage to keep the vivacity and power to entertain after a couple of sequels. But it's not impossible to conquer that level when the characters seem to have a life of their own, pushing every obstacle aside to guarantee a place in your heart. 'Madagascar 3' is simply an excellent journey there and back, where every new adventure brings a big smile to your face and sometimes tears to your eyes. I have never seen such an amazing accomplishment last so long. It's like falling in love all over again, with the advantage of already knowing each and every character, but confident that they will not disappoint you. And they don't. They are funny and more alive than ever. I just loved it!",10,9,19,13 July 2012
