First Man," Another Chazelle's masterpiece.

It," An excellent film!
","The new IT movie is very entertaining movie and some scenes were brutal. The 'bleeding in the sink' scene was the best scene from it, it was hell bloody. It has really beautiful cinematography! The kids were really good. Great performances all round. Sophia Lillis's character Beverly, the only girl in a group, is by far more interesting and better than the original Beverly. She gave really amazing performance, and was probably the best thing about the movie. The worst thing about this movie is Pennywise's teeth. His smile is annoying and horrible (also when his eyes moves is really annoying), but I liked when he tried to scare children. But again, he's just like 'annoyingly scary' clown. His costume is also bad. The original Pennywise is much, much better and always will be. But overall, it's not very scary, but I enjoyed it very much because it's well done, but it could have been a little better if Pennywise was good in it.",9,3,11,8 September 2017
Interstellar," After re-watching, it's still a masterpiece.
","I was so nervous of re-watching this one because it was one of my favorite films from years ago, since it's a pretty long movie, so I worried that this might ruin some things on the revatch. But when I was done, it's still epic in every way and for me it's still one of the best sci-fi films I've seen. Not a huge Nolan fan, but Interstellar was just incredible, emotional and beautiful. The original plot, the visuals, the score, the acting, the writting, were all amazing. The performances were excellent, especially Jessica Chastain, though nothing Oscar worthy. This is an excellent film and an absolute masterpiece of sci-fi films.10/10.",10,0,1,27 October 2018
Justice League," Just an okay superhero film.
","I'm really not a fan of superhero movies, but I'd give some thoughts of this movie. 'Man of Steel' and 'BvS' were crap (except the cinematography in Man of Steel), I liked 'Suicide Squad' a lot, but 'Justice League' was an okay film with some fun scenes. Let's talk about the characters; the only characters I liked are Wonder Woman and the fastest man alive. I haven't seen 'Wonder Woman' yet, but she's really that hot af, and her character makes me want to see her own movie. Aquaman is okay character, nothing special. Batman is just boring af.. Cyborg is also forgettable.Effects and fighting scenes didn't even impressed me anyway. It was too much, and it looks like they really tried so hard to make us 'Wow!', but it didn't even make me. It's just a film with lots of fighting scenes that didn't impressed me which will be forgettable movie someday. I'd give it a 6.5/10 for some good scenes and the characters as I mentioned (without those characters I liked, it would be 4/10).",6,21,39,15 November 2017
The Machinist," Brilliant movie! A masterpiece!
","The Machinist (2004) is a psychological thriller/drama film about an industrial worker who hasn't slept in a year begins to doubt his own sanity.A very dark and depressing film, but also excellent. This movie looks amazing when the colors faded to the point where it almost feels like a black-and-white film and it makes more dark/depressing film. When Bale showed his body, it made creepy how he looked very thin and he ate only one apple or one can of tuna a day for months. The story/plot twist are also awesome, but the ending is kinda sad. I'd give it a strong 10/10. Highly recommend!Christian Bale did really hard job for his role, he lost too much weight. I'm still shocked that he wasn't even nominated an Oscar for Best Actor.",10,0,1,10 March 2017
Jackie," Jackie is an excellent film!
","That's one very, very well done film! Natalie Portman's performance is just amazing, the best movie performance of the year. The crying scene where she cleans a blood on her face (after her husband had been shot).. that's one of the best crying scenes I've ever seen.I gave it a 9.5/10.",9,1,2,22 March 2017
Evil Dead," It's awesome.
","So, I just re-watched the reboot yesterday. I think it's great, but forgotten horror movie. But anyway, I like how it is too serious horror, dark and it's bloody awesome! The special effects/makeup were freaking awesome, and has absolutely no CGI (if I am right). I think it's the best job they ever did for horror movies since 2000. Very well-done! I thought the actors were all good, and the movie had better cast than Army of Darkness. I think they did very good jobs when they played possessed characters. Of course, it can't be better than the original or Evil Dead II, but I liked it better than Army of Darkness. I originally rated it a 10/10 on the first viewing, but after re-watching I gave it a 9/10. It's still brutal movie, but it's not the movie that I would watch over and over.",9,1,5,23 December 2016
Don't Breathe," One of the most exciting horror films of the year!
",I hell loved it! I like the way how they made first deaf movie (Hush) and then this blind movie in the same year. Imagine if you were in closed house with one very dangerous and strong blind man. The director Fede Alvarez did an amazing job for this movie and I'm looking forward to his next projects. I enjoyed every second of it and it had me like what's going to happen next lol.10/10.,10,0,4,22 March 2017
Mother!," A new psychological horror masterpiece!
","Since Black Swan (2010) is my all-time favorite film, I can't describe how 'mother!' much is strange and unusual movie. It is one hell of a film, but absolutely brilliant. I absolutely loved it! Excellent atmosphere! Stunning cinematography like from Black Swan. You will feel very awkward during watching because of weird situations. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely good in it and gave a powerful performance. In my opinion, she did her best performance so far and I am truly hoping she will be nominated an Oscar. Javier Bardem and Michelle Pfeiffer were also good actors. I wish I could see this movie again for the first time because it was hard to watch how much disturbing it is. I'd give it easily a 10/10 and this movie is in my top 40 of all time now. A new psychological horror masterpiece! Darren Aronofsky is one filmmaker that deeply disturbs me, he is just a genius director.",10,1,11,4 October 2017
Life," Really good horror/scifi film with brilliant ending!
","I'm was excited to see because I love horror films and I'm a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal. I'll write a short review about this movie here; I think it's so good, but my main problem is that characters didn't show their real feelings (just a bit), they were so cold when someone dies. Not afraid or nervous.I didn't find any characters really memorable except Jake Gyllenhaal's character, I thought he was good as always.The idea for horror story is cool, and the ending.. my God, it's unexpectedly shocking and sad, but brilliant. It's easily the best part of the movie! I'm glad they didn't make a happy ending.I don't get why Ryan Reynolds is on poster while he played the first character to die. It's simply because he is Deadpool lol.8/10, I really liked it!",8,2,8,26 March 2017
Evil Dead II," Brutal movie!
","One moment I got DVD of Evil Dead (2013), thanks to big brother. I was so surprised. It was great movie, I enjoyed a lot! And then a few days later or one month, I heard that original Evil Dead 2 will be on TV ! I'm was so excited and It was like to me 'Eh, it's two chapter, but okay and I'm so excited to watch it'.When I watched it, I thought that is funny and kinda strange movie because I never watched horror films from '80s. But anyway, I loved it seriously. I'm really glad they made a such great movie.I'm so more excited for new series 'Ash. vs. Evil Dead'. Now has ratings from 98,160 users, I can't wait to they get 100k! :D I'm just obsessed with Evil Dead movies. 11/10",10,3,4,29 April 2015
