Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good beginning.
","Phantom Menace was... different. The special effects were, of course, amazing, as were the light saber battles and costuming, etc. I prefer a mix of puppetry and CGI (A la Jurrasic Park) for realism, but this was very well done. The acting was, for the most part, very good. The characters were memorable, though they didn't seem to have the chemistry of Luke, Leia, and Han. Jake Lloyd was great, especially considering his age, and Natalie Portman portrayed a dedicated leader very well. What stands out about this movie, in comparison to the original three, is the deepening and intricacy of the plot. The three original movies each had a very simple story: Blow up the Death star, save captured friends, etc. The plotting on the part of Darth Sidious and the political games in the senate made this  more of a thinking movie, especially given several other plot threads involving Anakin  and the Sith. That, though, may be one of the problems with the film. It gave a more adult plot, with themes that would be lost on most children (Anakin's virgin birth, the symbiotic relationship with the midichlorians), but reduced itself to more childish humor. An attempt to draw all audiences, I suppose, but I did find Jar Jar extremely annoying... Over all, this is a good movie, and a great beginning. Anakin, Amidala and Qui-Gonn were focused on in this movie, and hopefully we'll learn more of Obi-Wann in the second. This is an excellent first chapter, and I have a feeling it will only get better.",7,0,0,25 May 1999
Spider-Man," Great movie, and a note to a previous review...
","The movie was good. very, very, good.But my point here is this: To whoever said below that the CGI was laughable, and he looked like a rubber doll....That was real. With a very few exceptions, the Spider-Man you saw there was actually Tobey Maguire in a harness, it was all blue screens and CGI backgrounds, the actual moving figure was real. If it looked like a rubber doll, it was because of the rubbery costume.Laughable, huh?",9,0,0,10 May 2002
Hellboy," Entertainment at its most complete
","The guy who said this was the worst comic book adaptation ever was A: an idiot, B: completely lacking in taste, and C: an idiot. Maybe I'm being harsh, but calling this a worse movie than Superman 4, Batman and Robin, Catwoman, and The Crow: Salvation is just inexcusable.This movie has Ron Perlman as maybe the single most entertaining, charismatic action hero since Bruce Campbell gave us Ash. Funny, seemingly invincible, terribly vulnerable, and remarkably human, Hellboy carries you through a movie with every element of entertainment. Spectacular visuals, humor, a completely badass gas-mask-clad villain, and convincing relationships that aren't sidelined to overdone action. And possibly the most romantic line ever given to a hero who's just saved the girl.The themes are treated with, dare I say it, a bit of a heavy hand, but they're important and appropriate for an audience that will include teens and pre-teens. And as far as flat-out, wall-to-wall, grinning to yourself entertainment, this movie is second to none in 2004.",9,0,1,20 August 2004
The Matrix," A well balanced Sci-Fi
","Yes, the Matrix wasn't completely original. There were plot elements that were similar to Dark City, Terminator, Total Recall, The Truman Show, and Greek Philosophy. However: It blended aspects form all of these movies into a single story that grabs the viewer both intellectually and visually. First, the plot was neither 'non-existent' as some claim, or 'overly-complex' as others do. It was fairly straight forward, but posed many questions. They were, for the most part, answered in the film, but *only* in the context of the film. It is not a film that tells you, it's a film that asks you. Second, It has become far too 'cool' to be uncool. Pretentious twits who harp on movies for using special high-tech special effects, having action sequences, or giving the main characters sunglasses don't seem to realize that these things all serve the same purpose as the half-baked love story inserted into 'Titanic.' They are there to give the audience an emotional response as well as an intellectual one. They inspire excitement and awe... Which is at *least* as valuable as any masochistic desire to cry at a sad film. Emotional response, in whatever form, is valuable, and the Matrix pulls off these things exceedingly well. In short, The Matrix is an excellent balance of intellect, action, style, and awe. If you give the plot half the attention you give the effects, you won't be disappointed.",10,0,0,1 June 1999
