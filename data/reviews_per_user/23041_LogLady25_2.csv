The Blair Witch Project," The Brilliant 'found footage' Film
","The found footage stereotype doesn't apply here. A lot of people don't like this movie because the witch isn't shown. That's exactly why it's brilliant. If they had used special effects and shown the witch, this movie would be outdated and silly. Without the witch, there is just the idea of the witch. We know that they've gone in circles and we see them go crazy. The only confirmation of the witch that was needed was the ending. It's the story that they tell about the boys in the cabin. It's more of a psychological movie than it is a gory horror movie. The whole thing is about the idea of paranormal activity. It's the most terrifying movie I've ever seen.",9,2,5,11 September 2015
Jurassic World," Pretty much the same as the previous movies.
","This movie has better special effects than the previous three, but they're still basically all the same. There are two people who get together in the end, there are the kids who get lost in the park, and then there's a bad guy. When the kids are in the bubble, it's the same situation and the same shot as when the kids are in the car with the dinosaur in the first movie. Not to mention how cheesy the ending was. They were all safe and Dallas Bryce Howard and Chris Pratt literally walked off into a light. It was the perfect Hollywood ending. It's a modernized version of the first three. The improved dinosaurs are the only reason to watch this movie. Also, the 3D was pretty scary in some scenes.",5,54,110,13 August 2015
