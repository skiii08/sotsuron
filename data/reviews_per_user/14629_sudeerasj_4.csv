Ford v Ferrari," If this isn't worth the ticket price, Then I don't know what is.
","Cool cars, great acting, artistic direction, excellent cinematography and thrilling car races. All packed into a well-written character drama about the man's never ending quest for perfection, friendship, team-effort and corporate greed.",10,1,2,24 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," A 2 hour 45 minute video tutorial on 'How to make the perfect sequel'
","The original Blade Runner was one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made. The sequel, 'Blade Runner: 2049' takes its best elements and actually builds upon them. The result is a beautifully shot, visually stunning movie with an incredible story polished to perfection with amazing performances.Logan, Baby Driver, War for the Planet of the Apes, Dunkirk and now this. Damn, 2017 is on fire.",10,2,11,18 October 2017
Suicide Squad," The only villain in here is the movie itself
","It's only the 3rd movie in the cinematic universe and DC has found a new low. Instead of trying to remove the heat created by the controversial responses to their previous movie with a proper live- action adaptation of Green Lantern or any other iconic superhero, They chose to do this. A movie about assembling a team of super villains to stop another super villain from destroying the humanity. This does sound interesting until you actually watch the movie and realise that if the US government really wanted to save the humanity, all they had to do was to NOT assemble this team.In a world where batman, wonder woman and flash already exists, the only way to protect the country is the Suicide Squad. An all villain/anti-hero team consisting of a marksman, a girl with a baseball bat, a guy with a boomerang, a guy who can shoot fire from his bare hands and transform into a giant fire monster, a Japanese lady with a sword,a guy who can climb anything(Seriously ? this guy ?), a half man-half crocodile person and a witch awakened by probably the world worst archaeologist ever. Yup. They totally doesn't match with each other or to stop any actual threat. but the director tries really hard to convince us otherwise by having them fight faceless CGI creatures that poses no threat to even Harley Quinn or capt. Boomerang of all people. The fights are poorly executed and doesn't have any real stakes. there is absolutely nothing to make us feel that we should care about these characters either. They just get together, go to some place, take down all the CGI creatures, move to another place, take down all the CGI creatures and keep doing that until they find the big bad guy and defeat him in on of the most dullest final battles in film history. That's it. there's nothing good to be taken from this movie except the great performances by Will smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis that aren't enough to save this movie.",5,0,0,2 June 2017
Justice League," You know there's something wrong when the best part about the movie is the post-credit scene.
","I watched JL and I managed to enjoy it even though it failed to live up to my expectations. Sure, it's not the best comic-book movie ever. Sure, it has its own set of flaws most of which affects to the viewers who aren't familiar with the comics. Sure, the re-writes, the last minute edits and the re-shoots has obviously ruined what seems like it could have been a great movie. But still I think it is a good(just good) movie and worth checking out despite all of that. Perhaps even more than once if you're a fan of these characters.I gave this movie a Solid 7 out of 10 :++ The opening sequence. ++ True to the source portrayals of the beloved DC characters for the most part. ++ The chemistry between the JL members. ++ The cast and their performances. ++ Great action scenes and set-pieces. ++ Likable, inspiring heroes worth caring for. Especially the Flash and Wonder Woman. ++ That killer post-credits scene.What I didn't like :<ul><li>Steppenwolf AKA the latest entry in the long list of 'Bad-ass looking CGI punching bags whose sole reason to be in the movie is so the good guys can get it together and move the plot along'. This is is the 4th one of these kind to be in a DCEU movie and it has only been 5 movies. And this one is the worst of it after Enchantress. He is a great fighter for sure but that's pretty much everything about this guy.</li></ul><ul><li>The plot. Or the lack thereof. After Mr. Snyder temporarily stepped away from the project, WB decided to remove a huge chunk of the movie. And to make things worse, they reshot and heavily changed the rest of it. In the end, this movie has such a simple plot it's barely enough to fill an episode in a TV show. The mother boxes are the definitive version of McGuffins. Every scene and dialogue is full of heavy exposition and takes the fast lane to the third act. this can be very annoying to the viewers who aren't familiar with the comics or the characters.</li></ul><ul><li>WB and Whedon. Seriously WB, at what point did you start to think a 'story problem' in a movie can be fixed by hiring the same director who did Age of Ultron, let him completely rewrite the ending along with some of the most crucial stuff in the movie while adding an unhealthy amount of unnecessary CGI, quips and digitally removed moustaches. Way to f*** things up at the last minute WB. this is the least Zack Snyderesque Zack Snyder movie ever and not in any good way. You should have released his original cut as is instead of you know, trying to pander the movie into literally everyone in the world.</li></ul>So I think you get my opinion of the movie. It's far from perfect but still it's progress. If you aren't familiar with the comics or the DC characters, It's possible you won't enjoy this movie since it doesn't bother to explain much as it goes along. But if you're a fan of DC and JL even by a little bit. There's a lot for you in this. Because finally, finally, the Justice League is on the big screen and you can actually cheer for them and be inspired by them.P.S - You better not mess what you teased at the end of credits WB. I'm a huge fan. But the the day you mess that up is the day I'm done with these movies.",4,1,4,18 November 2017
