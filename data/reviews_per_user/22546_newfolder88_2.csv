Mission: Impossible III," A copy?
","When I first time watched it at cinema I thought - yea it's cool -> action, effects etc. But then after a few days I had an opportunity to watch Mission Impossible 2... and I see that it's almost the same! The only difference is girlfriend=/=wife, just listen...In the second one there was virus (it was named chimera?) which could kill many people. But meanwhile girl injected virus herself so the bad guys couldn't use it. Then Tom Cruise has little amount of time to rescue her - which he does in the end. So the the whole plot was - Cruise rescuing the girl; they don't care about terrorists, whole earth which can be killed, no. They just want to help girl.In the III part it's almost the same. We have Rabbit Foot (we don't know what's this but everyone wants to have it), bad guy, Tom cruise and girlfriend (which now is his wife). After all nice action scenes his wife is kidnapped and then starts the motive which is repeated after 2nd part of the movie - he wants to rescue her... Fighting with terrorism is on the second plan.For me M:I2=M:I3, that's why Mission Impossible (first part) is the best - there is betrayer, list of agents and two 'teams' trying to get it. They don't want to rescue poor girl :D bye",7,1,1,26 February 2009
Forrest Gump," .....Impressed
","For me it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. But I wanted to say something else. I've just read book (Forrest Gump of course) and I'm very impressed. This book is not as good as movie and I admire someone (Zemeckis? or somebody) who read it, removed sub-plots almost like from cartoon (spaceship, living in the jungle etc.), changed few things (meeting with Bubba, Dan), added (cross-country running, hint about Apple etc.) and made such a cool script. Finding book which is decent and changing it to Oscar-winning movie is something what I like. In opposite to few movies (i.e godfather?) when book is genius and it's just remade to movie (2 chapters removed is not much of work).",10,3,5,26 February 2009
