Hereditary," 2 hours of my life... gone
","After watching the trailers I was excited to see this film. Once the credits came, I couldn't help but feel I will never get this time back. There are not many endings that can beat this for being so awful. The only good thing about this film was at times there was some terrific acting. It's a shame the storyline did not live up to it",3,3,6,27 June 2018
