The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Civil War- behind the scenes
","(No major plot spoilers, but if cautious, skip it)For Katniss Everdeen Dog days are over. The Games seem like a distant past, an easy aspect, now the hard part- leading a revolution and winning it. The uprisings in Ukraine, Ferguson and other Eastern countries- it seems quite coincidental such movie came out when many countries are in similar state of insurgency. There's death, there's blood, there's chaos, there's hope. New scriptwriter changes formula of previous two completely, it's not YA dystopia Romance, it is a political thriller. Districts cluster together to overthrow the ruling power, and previously-believed-dead 13 is head of it all. Battle of propaganda begins- when Capitol threatens death when ceasefire is disturbed, Katniss overtakes the screen adding fire to the conflict. Like a tennis game, each side tries to overthrow other one using means of media and persuasion. There was yo-yo effect when I was wondering whenever to go this one, or not. All points balanced negatively: Catching Fire was a tedious watch, the book was awful, it is a stretched continuity (due to it being split in half); but, after seeing it on big screen- I have to say money was not wasted, as presumably, this is the best installment yet. The movie is like the book, but it managed to repair all faults the novel had. In meaning- clumsy dialog was replaced with much stronger, consistent. It was hard to imagine characters talk in the novel, their voices barely differed and sounded odd to be said out loud. The actors and new scriptwriter manages to change given material into powerful, at times humors pieces of text. J. Law. was at her greatest (is it just me or the new A-listers get better with age- like wine!). Whilst the book couldn't balance thoughts of Katniss (which ran for good half of the book, mourning on how poor she is, how stupid everyone is, and her pointless dilemma of Peeta and Gale), here the given time is spend on speeches, behind-the-scenes working of the ruling powers and action sequences from other districts (which in books were casual remarks). I even jumped back to my original review of Mockingjay, to see what I found wrong with the source two years ago (and upon re-reading still seeing them)'(Katniss)starts to act like Bella, oh no!' She's strong and independent, because we leave her head her inner romantic struggle is just a low key note in the movie. 'District 13 is boring, vicious and Grey, like everything in world of Panem, but reading about Seam or Capitol seemed interesting, while 13, not.' The improved graphics add sleek touch to the grim surrounding, although I have to agree- there's four similar scenes, which become less effective with usage, Katniss climbs the rubble to find destruction. Also, we barley leave few locations, which may annoy some. ( I am mildly insulted for not including the hummingbird room, it would splash a color for a contrast) ' Katniss is mortal, we know it, but why does Collin make her suffer so much? She had survived fire, water, knives and guns; in Mockingjay she gets injured and faints a lot, I really mean it, good 70% of book is about Katniss sitting in hospital and recovering from attack. So, book is: 2 pages of mare action, 10 pages of pointless talking, page for character development and 20 pages for sitting in hospital (divide it by five to get entire book).' There are 3 brief hospital scenes, and Katniss is more readily jumping into action without anyone shielding her. Also, many scenes which were just referenced or skimmed over without explanation are developed here- we see action, how it influences the politics and human nature aspect of it. Making it a deep, meaningful series of scenes.'Collins ends them, concludes new stuff, but what about old stuff, Districts and Capitol, Gale and Peeta, the answers for events we were waiting for since first book! Well, Collins seemed to forgot about them, and started to conclude (the new) boring stuff.' Unlike original books movies from start to end have a running continuity, such as Snow drinking from cup and spilling blood, this is mainly gained by leaving single POV, and returning to old characters (Effie was a highlight, I am glad she didn't disappear like she did in the book!). The film producers have better insight of reality and know what will happen from start to finish, something Collins didn't do.'Did she have forgotten that this book is about Hunger Games, and we want to see how actual games end? But here we have, nothing about districts, about life after games. Also Finnick, Collins treats him as a background character, while new character like Boggs gets more attention.' No, all characters have fair proportion of time, there's no casual mention, there's screen time and carefully balanced. (Possible spoiler alert)Only negativity is the aftertaste, as closing 20 minutes are a drag (while rest of the movie is not). There's a series of speeches repeating the same notion and over-the-top reunion with Peeta is the thing that makes you leave cinema with snoopy face. They could've cut it quicker. (Fin)While I gave the book 35/100, the movie gets 80/100 For strong acing, visuals, direction, depth, emotional drama, realism and message. I cannot believe I say it- the movie is better than the book! Fun notes:<ul><li>the hanging tree song and scene is a highlight -Haymitch/Effie are still my favorites, I did like Cressida too. -Soundtrack from first movies makes a wonderful comeback -P.S.Hoffmans swan song</li></ul>",8,12,40,23 November 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Every frame is a painting
","Wes Andersons dark artistic comedy; now, any individual would notice that the genre on left hand side is contradictory to each other. How a comedy can be artistic? Whilst I did not laugh, nor smile, at this eccentric, yet intriguing tale: of the owner of a damned establishment of European Grand Budapest Hotel and his immigrant lobby boy, as they embark on a tale featuring a stolen painting and a desired will; I throughly enjoyed this amusedly odd spectacle. Filled with vibrating colors, great architecture and the set that surely was amusedly atrocious to set out- kudos to the winners of award, you deserve it here- the lead co-act was top notch, a cheery on the cupcake. Every frame is a painting. While other directors do movies, Anderson does motion pictures.",8,1,4,12 March 2015
The Theory of Everything," Just peanuts for space
","It would be lovely to have A Theory of Everything, a lovely tuning in equation that can explain and predict the movement of celestial and atomic bodies in a vacuum (if there is such) of space. Anyone even vaguely interested in science would discard such thought- science and a theory that explains everything- all the factors that seem to contradict each other and are impossible to replicate- in a field that over a span of month new theory can resurface and rewrite our current knowledge. That what makes most of scientists bonkers, it is impossible to ever be right, and this statement is underlining (because at some aspects right can be right no matter what). And now it became abstractly confusing and I am not sure what I am- review- yes- I was supposed to review, not, em, confuse with random ideological thesis. I can securely state that over a good percentage of the globe is capable of recognizing name Stephen Hawking, or image of the crippled, old man with computer on a wheelchair. No wonder, this is now the name we use to describe genius. Even when many quoting Einstein or Hawking cannot place finger on the exact thing those figures have discovered. It has, after all, little to do with us- in other words- causing Apple to fall on the ground is not a form of demonstration. It requires abstract thinking, something that our mind does not need. Hawking a publisher of worldwide bestseller A Brief History of Time: From Big Bang to Black Holes, like title suggests is a quite brief historical account that explains notion of space/time, and it begins with explosion of arguably nothing that caused creation of everything and is possibly going to end in a bing crunch. Don't worry, you have millennium of time- you may think that going down to the groceries is a lot, but that's just peanuts to space. Oh- Ah- I should be reviewing a movie. Yes, this high scorer in categories varying from acting to music, is a second critically acclaimed biopic of a revolutionary Cambridge graduate. Now, I preferred the previous one, here meaning The Imitation Game. Even when from a personal point of view I prefer Hawking over Turing, that arrogant sense of humor, I am to judge movie not person. Recorded in an unorthodox way, with extreme close ups and vintage coloring board. Playing with light and not bothering to polish the inequalities- the camera work was unique- and kept me distracted from the narrative. Which is not a thing camera work should do. Yet I loved the time lapses and reverse edit at the end, and one shot that made me feel Hawkings frustration over the table. Score, much like in most of biopics was this idyllic combination of calm piano notes. The acting, although the supporting cast was passable and widely ranged, all the focus goes to young Eddie Redmeye- who throughout the movie feels like authentic Stephen Hawking- and shows a wide palette of talent, when tacking the scientist during different stages of the illness. I did have no problems with pacing, but at times the story seemed to drag. I did not really feel sympathetic to the characters, not surely why, I cannot place my finger on it (much like on a single electron). I disliked Jane, maybe she was supposed to be like this, but the movie did not keep me interested to see how her fate would unfold. I didn't feel like being part of the event, not sure if I am the observer, or if i am to step into shoes (or wheels) of the man. Cinematographically, a waste of potential- so much more could be done to show the anger and confusion and struggle, also, there was a chance of graphically explaining the abstract theories, which I was waiting for, quite blankly. There was no 'wow' moment in which the plot, camera and music come into a wonderful crescendo and unison and your mind goes 'this is it'. Concluding, it is a good, insightful watch. With great, ambitious lead and interesting presentation, which unfortunately also brings movie to a 'uncomfortable' style of narrative, that instead adding to fluidity slows it down. A good watch, but not a must see- recommendation.

The Imitation Game," The Human Differences set aside
","Rather recently I have read a periodical in a technical text, albeit outdated, it pointed out an interesting point. We do all believe that nature is surely most efficient and flawless system to be ever created- what a common misconception- even function such as photosynthesis wastes more than it produces. Similar thing happens with natural selection- inequalities forming mutations during the DNA synthesis are the only thing that drives the evolution- if not a copy mistake we would've barely moved further than a small microbe. On the other hand, such mutations, are not widely acceptable by the nature- nature eliminates everything that is different- be it a frog without a leg, or leopard with white socks- and here comes the inefficiency. If nature wants to improve by making mistakes, why does it want to erase them short while later?The Imitation Game doesn't address this process, but on borderline, you can see it. That is if you pay attention, which we are strongly advised in the opening minutes, same as information that in the end, after hearing the story, we're to make a decision- is our unlikely hero Alan Turing a human or a machie, a mistake in the system or its key note? To arrive to the conclusion (with clever use of non-chronological time lapses), we are to burrow into mind of Alan Turing, most acclaimed mathematician of recent century (albeit awarded for his doing in 2013), a professor at Cambridge, and an unique personality. This story is a biopic, it depicts on his life and his doings, most notable being a huge part of Enigma cracking. Of course disarming of the German Device goes to many names and countries- Poland for starting it, being the pioneers and inventors of the first machine; the governments keeping it a secret; soviets having a go- but, this being movie about Turing, his actions make for a highlight. I, being an introverted person, struggling to form a simple sentence or participate in any social activity- could understand the frustration of Alan. I know I speak different, I know that sometimes it looks like I don't feel things, it's not my fault, you take it for granted as you can do it, while I struggle keeping end with end and your giggling is not helping. Not all people are going to accept you, it is natural selection, some will praise you and cheer at your successes, some will just wait till you trip- it's life, it's natural some people are more primitive than other. Turing is a person hard to like- arrogant, autistic genius- that would surely sneer at your idiocies and confusingly gape at any remark. With a squeaky accent and intervals in speech he makes for a poor companion, if not Joan, a revolutionary only-woman on the team, played by Kiera Knightley, the entire film would've surely end up being an one-man show. And I know, either way, that the lead actor (Ben. C.) would've managed to hold it up, his performance is strong (maybe not worthy a win, but surely a nomination) but it trips at times, the accent sometimes feels inconsistent, and his role differs just slightly from pieces that made his milestones. The strongest thing about Ben, is that he can play clever (god bless, in real life he's all but smart), it has to be clear and fast voice going well with the Victorian triangular face. Greatest talent of this freshly-emerged A-list actor is that he can take arrogant and unlikable into a passable, charismatic pals. We don't get offended when he insults the public, we laugh and respect him. That's a rare thing. (Although, I really don't want him to get an Oscar, Sherlock production is slow as it is). There's no member of cast that doesn't do a good job. The movie is accompanied by a great score, fine script and cinematography. It's two hour run might drag, although this is due to compact location of story rather than the plot (which has no dull point and is tense from start to finish). The lack of context on Enigma can anger some, and I've heard that there are some historical inconsistencies (but I don't know the first thing about history, so cannot comment). Other notes:-I did not read the biography or watched too much source material to comment on their accuracy. I cannot say how accurate thing is without reading at least 3 different accounts; how can you judge without having strong points of evidence?-Felt little like A Beautiful Mind-The copper coil wire was funny, especially when you know what happened recently-It takes place in Manchester, at Manchester University with alumni of Lead Actor. Manchester should be chuffed. It is not really. -Cumberbatch has low chances of beating other Oscar candidates- he's not only genius this year- but then again, I cannot say without watching -People laughed, frequently. -Some people cried, I personally felt sad too. Watchability 8/10 (I would eagerly put it back on) Overall 76/90* 85%*(originality to the source is not being counted)",9,5,10,15 November 2014
Jurassic World," John Hammonds Flea Circus
","Sorry that it is unprofessional and hammy, but - rant is what I need, rant is what I do- mutiny, anarchy- lets go.Ah. Where do I begin? That I have lost faith in humanity? Michael Crichton is spinning in his grave, grieving. Critics praise this Reboot... To be 'suitable for new generation' I feel sorry for that new generation. 1993 Jurassic Park is an all time classic. This is a very poor B-class movie. Like Ouija or Age of Extinction - or any other CGI heavy summer flick that will trend for a week, then is sold in Pound Shops. But I waited for it. Since 2001. 1993 is an all time classic, it had great characters, it was based and explored science- genetic engineering in time when it was just a myth- the effects were groundbreaking, moral suitable, humour dry and dark but indirect- it was classic. This is a poor parody that tries to be funny (it isn't). CGI is apparent to such extent, if JP1 was out now, it would've beaten it by mile. I laughed a lot- because of the bleakness of the story (If this was on TV, when Pratt and dinosaurs 'talk', in first 10 minutes, I would've considered switching it off). My little paleontological heart broke in million pieces, but, at least they have subtly mentioned bird evolution, but rest- caricatures- flying reptiles rampaging, eating people (fish eaters, sorry), dinosaurs talking to em that hybrid thing (bleak design)(ignore), by the end two dinosaurs and a marine reptile 'team up' to defeat the 'baddie' dinosaur, yeah, that's the plot. I would've said it is for three year old audience, but then, there was a five year old sitting close to me and she fell asleep. Gah, these dinosaurs really didn't have anything to eat. This movie underlines world dinosaur and associates them with blood thirsty, giant scaly monsters. While in fact, majority of dinosaurs were size of a pony, many of carnivores possibly scavengers, and chunk of sauropods covered in feathers. This creates wrong image for entire field, 1992 movie inspired generation of palaeontologists; while this may trend as an app buy-in-game trend for five year old, and be forgotten as soon as identical new thing emerges. John William tune was underused, and anyway, something of such superiority should not be used in this thing. There was no 'ahh! Lovely' Scene which is so trademark to the trilogy. (and The William theme should play in that scene.) I would've given it points if it was there. Because the theme on its own made my eyes wet. My favorite aspects were the call backs to the first movie, such as John Hammond sculpture, visit of the old visitor area, the blurred copy of Ian Malcolm book, Dr Henry Wo, that talkative DNA double helix. But it was in form of Easter eggs, not enough. There was a lot of repetitive dull humour, which was both corny and in all ways funny-not (actually it was funny, because of its badness?). The actors are terrible, but that may be fault of the poor paced, Cartoon script- (Lego Movie had more realistic characters.) Chris Pratt was better as Emmet, than this Owen guy (you named him after a palaeontologist? You sly things) who was an oh ah Raptor whisperer. Gah, this hurts. Other interesting points -Cuttlefishes make a re-appearance as nightmare inducing monsters (first one being in the Avengers movie), I actually think they are cute, always look happy -Remember PS1 game JP: Warpath? I want to play it again -Jimmy Fallon cameo... That made me happy. -If there is going to be a cinema-sin counter, this movie would require two twenty minute videos to count all the ridicules -But imagine this billionaire guy being played by Robert D. Jr. Imagine. 'World is shredding to pieces. But don't look at me like it is my fault.' 'People are dying, but, hey, look DINOSAURS' -Product Placements -Beats make a reappearance -Much of this movie felt like Mercedes Benz expo -I would've preferred to be on that expo -Steven Spielberg, I am loosing faith in you buddy, stop 'producing' stuff like this -Amblin logo had a nice make over This one- they, they put JP banner on fire, that's a great metaphor for entire movie. Recently I have broken my star system because Birdman was 'too great to fit into the category'. This movie broke my system again because I want to give it a negative numbers. It is a 20/100 movie, but, personal damage slices it to -10/100. Congratulations Hollywood.And don't riposte with: 'You don't know what fun means', 'Treat it as a stand alone movie', 'It is just a summer flick'. Because this movie is an original follow up to the original much more thought provoking movie, and it should at least try and live up to its intellectual standard. There's a difference between a good movie, and a good movie with excuses.",1,176,349,12 June 2015
