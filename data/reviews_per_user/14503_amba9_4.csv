Hereditary," Worth seeing if only for a couple of strong performances
","Yes, moody, suspensful and at times feeling of terror, and Toni Collette just owns this movie, but
the ending is utterly over the top.",6,0,1,18 June 2018
Cloverfield," Too short
","After the 15 minutes of party at the beginning it leaves about 60 minutes of movie time. I felt a little 'robbed' because it ended suddenly. In fact you hear 'Rob' said too many times by Hud.The hand-held camera effect(like it was used in '28 Weeks later') was great, it maximized the suspense. The main characters could probably could have escaped the monster and the city but Rob had a conscience. He had to find his ex-girlfriend and so headed back to her apartment. We need more of these types of movies where **SPOILER ** the good guys/pretty girls don't survive. Overall though, it didn't achieve the heights it promised at the beginning.",6,0,1,25 October 2008
A Quiet Place," Unconvincing horror
","Another movie you'll forget soon after seeing it.
Somehow women and babies/children often survive anything and everything thrown at them, which
then makes it predictable, nothwithstanding you ride the wave of action along the way.
The premise is good, delivery is fair.",6,1,1,17 April 2018
The Descent," Not to miss
","This was a pleasant surprise, as I too thought that with only a cast of young women would lend it self to sexiness, women would win the day etc etc. Write/Director Marshall does a supreme job from the first minute with a graphic fatal car crash for all except the lead actress, which would haunt her a year on when this trip takes place. It is certainly claustrophobic as most of the time it's filmed in the dark cave but I thought it only added to the tenseness. It comes with some very good unsuspecting frights and the 'creatures' that live in the caves are convincingly portrayed as a thoroughly ravenous species. **Spoiler *** One of the final scenes where Juno, the Asian woman that mislead the other women but not in a bad mischievous sense, is left with only a flare and a badly severed leg amongst a hoard of these creatures leaves an imprint in your mind for a while. A superb horror movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.",8,1,3,11 April 2009
