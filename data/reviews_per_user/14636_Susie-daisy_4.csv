The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Beautiful
","The Twilight Saga is essentially a love story. When I go see a Twilight film at the cinema I'm going because I want to see the story of Bella & Edwards love, any extra action in the movies is just a bonus. If you don't like watching films that focus on two people in love then just don't go see Twilight, but don't take the time to review it either because your judgement of the film won't be valid if it was just never going to be your type of film to begin with. Anyway, as a 25 year old female I thought this film was beautiful. I've read the books but I try not to read them too much before seeing a film because then I'd just be going over everything that was missed out or not done exactly right. I just go see the film for what it is, their best effort to make a film 'based' on a very thick book. I was so happy with Breaking Dawn. Wedding scenes are of course scenes that countless films and TV shows have done again and again but no wedding has ever been filmed as beautifully as this one. I felt like I was there and I was getting a bit emotional watching it. One of the great things about this movie is that a lot of time is spent on getting the romance and real love between Bella & Edward right. These guys are good together, and it was nice to see them so happily in love. Kristen and Rob have worked hard to get these scenes exactly right and as I fan I really appreciate that. While I was looking forward to the wedding and sex scene, the other scenes I was a bit unsure of as I wasn't really sure how they could film it on a way that would work but it certainly exceeded my expectations and the imprinting and birth scene were both done amazingly. I won't go on about every scene I loved, I'll just say I was thrilled with this movie as were the people I was with and anyone else I've spoken to about it. Also the final scene, couldn't have done it any better, it was visually amazing to watch.Definitely the most emotional and beautiful Twilight film so far. Well done to everyone who worked on this film : )",10,13,31,18 November 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," There is nothing wrong with this movie
","I was both excited and worried when first going to see New Moon. Excited because I love Twilight the film and all the books. Worried because this was the second film I'd be seeing where I'd read and loved the book first and was anxious to whether or not they'd get it right. I'd read and loved the Half blood Prince before seeing the film and the film became a huge disappointment. Although I'll never be fully happy because its impossible to fit a whole book into just over 2 hours and so there are things I'm gonna miss, i can't say I was upset. Most people who complain about the acting and the film as a whole are just non fans who can't stand that its become so big, and I'm getting bored of listening to these people online. I've read the books a lot, and so has my boyfriend. Neither of us are silly little teens, we're both mature 23 year olds and although he's more of a J.R.R. Tolkien fan and not obsessed with Twilight like I am, he thought New Moon had been done very well and stayed very true to the book. Some of his other male friends who'd been dragged to the cinema with there girlfriends also hated to admit that they enjoyed it. The acting of every main character was done exactly as I'd imagined from the books if not better. Although I love them both, I wasn't sure if Kristen and Rob could make the break up scene as heartbreaking as it should be but I actually found myself caught up in every second of it and was blown away. I feel like after Twilight they realised how special these books are to people and they put everything into knowing these characters. Anyone who wasn't impressed with there acting doesn't get the characters in the book. If they weren't doing it right, Stephanie M would have let them know. Jacobs character was also a lot like I imagined and the chemistry between Jacob and Bella was played out perfectly, as was Bella and Edward. I loved the way the film captured that even though Bella is growing closer to Jacob, he can still never be Edward, this is something I was worried about before seeing the film. And can I just say, Bella is a teenage girl who is so clumsy, always worrying and so insecure and helpless. Yet she always puts everyone else first and will risk her life in an instant to protect the people she loves. Okay she really needs the vampire she loves in an unhealthy type of way. But he needs her that way as well and thats what love is, thats why its such a strong story. Love that powerful makes you weak and tells a great story. And thats what the Twilight sage is about, its about Bella and Edwards love and how nothing can overcome it. Its a great love story and she's a great role model. Anyway, everyone did a great job, New Moon is beautiful and hasn't done fantastically for no reason, I'm just worried about Eclipse now but although I'm not sure about the director, I fully trust the cast. I've not been this excited about a bunch of movies and books in my life but I've given 9 instead of 10 because I really didn't like the vampire contact lenses this time around and being New Moon, like Bella I really missed Edward Cullen and no amount of muscles can help with that.",10,13,28,25 November 2009
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," A not so exciting book becomes a heart stopping movie
","My vote of 10 is not me saying this is the best movie and storyline ever told and it couldn't get any better. It's me saying as a book fan that this film does not disappoint and does all that it can and more with the time and story it has to work with.After many years of waiting Bella Swan the human has become Bella Cullen the vampire and it just comes so naturally to her and I must praise Kristen here as all throughout the film I noticed how different she was with her movement, speech, everything. The girl has nailed it and I respect her so much for the dedication she has put into these films for the fans. I'm not going to get into the storyline as most people have an idea of the plot by now. What I want to say is that for the people who love these characters this film brings with it the twilight humour we love, touching family affection, some interesting and likable new characters and if you can manage to avoid spoilers of the big twist this film will get your heart racing.If you hate Twilight and everything about it then don't go see it...but also don't go on message boards complaining about it either. These movies weren't made for you so just go live your life and forget about them. For the millions of people out there who love these characters go see the movie and give the characters an emotional last goodbye.Thank you Twilight cast for being such a big part of my life for the last 5 years. It wouldn't have been the same without you x",10,9,23,17 November 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Beautiful and very true to the book
","I read all these reviews before seeing this film. After reading a few I realised there was no point in reading more. I think because these movies are so intensely loved by fans and are so hugely talked about and promoted everywhere, people who don't get the craze can't stand it because whether you love them on not, the characters are everywhere you look and it can drive people crazy and cause them to have severe hate towards the whole thing if they don't understand the fuss. A lot of movie critics will write terrible reviews about this film, whether the films good or bad, its just what movie critics do, so I wouldn't take anything they say seriously. Anyway, Eclipse. I've read all books, I'm team Edward, Eclipse is my favourite book. I was nervous about this film, the trailers I watched had me worried. But it was actually very true to the book(as much as a 2 hour movie can be to a 628 page book)I had previously thought the Bella/Edward scenes in New Moon were okay, but after seeing Eclipse I realised they weren't. The Bella/Edward scenes in Eclipse are beautiful, you can tell the actors have really grown into there characters and also feel so comfortable working together. The camera angles, the music, it all really works in Eclipse. David Slade has surprised me. I just wish they'd get rid of the Vampire contact lenses. The ones from Twilight were fine. If your a Twilight fan, I don't understand if you find yourself not enjoying this film. If your not a Twilight fan, I still don't get how you could find yourself hating it, your just being stubborn and possibly even immature. But if you do find yourself disliking it, fair enough, forget about it and move on with your life, instead of all the others who seem to hate it so much they can't stop talking about it. Overall I'm gonna say Eclipse is the best out of 3. The acting is amazing. I'm so impressed by how well these actors have understood the characters, especially Edward as he's a touch character to portray properly and I don't think many people would be able to get it right, but Robert Pattinson manages to play the beautiful vampire just the way it should be and for that I love him.",10,3,10,5 July 2010
