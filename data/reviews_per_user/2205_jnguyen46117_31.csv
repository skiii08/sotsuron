The King's Speech," The King's Speech: 10/10
","The King's Speech is visual stunning with it's fantastic cinematography, dramatic performances from the cast, and it's perfect pacing. The story set back in the early 1930s when World War II was beginning. King George V was serious ill and when he died, he gave the throne to his oldest son. Unfortunately, George's oldest son was dethroned by the Parliment and gave the spot to the next oldest son, (Berty, Colin Firth). Berty became King George VI and carrying on his shoulder the weight of going to war. Giving a wartime speech is clearly very important at the time but it was proved very difficult since Berty had a stammering problem ever since he was little. His wife, Elizabeth, seeked help from a 'speech therapist', Lionel (Geoffrey Rush). Although he was helping the king of England, Lionel treats Berty as if he was a normal guy. Earning trust throughout the months from the king, Geoffrey was able to help the king give a decent speech. Predictable, but there wasn't supposed to be any surprises. Colin Firth is perhaps the only actor in Hollywood who can stammer his lines as good as he was in this film. But stammering and pausing in between words isn't going to cut it. Giving an emotional yet humorous performance, Colin Firth has guaranteed himself a spot in this year's Academy Awards. Firth isn't the only one who stood out. His companions Helena Bohem Carter and Geoffrey Rush is probably the best choice for the roles they played. Playing the king's wife and had very little lines, Helena Bohen Carter is still eligible for her second Oscar nomination which she will earn. Geoffrey Rush as a teacher isn't the best idea, but seeing him on screen is gripping in every which way.David Seidler delivered a very top-class script that points towards the Oscars in every direction. Making Colin Firth pausing in between everything he says and Geoffrey Rush's smooth language, Seidler is about to earn himself a first Oscar nomination.Tom Hooper directed this without holding back proving himself to be one of the better directors in Hollywood. Making an R-rated film only because of a few F-words shows that he was willing to make the film for what it is, not to get a larger audience. With great knowledge on the era and fantastic style, Tom Hooper is the guy to watch out for. Solidly written, beautifully cinematographed, elegantly directed, and perfectly acted, The King's Speech might be the Best Picture contender to look out for (The Social Network).OscarBuzz: A lot but here are the major, Best Picture (might win), Best Director (good chance), Best Actor (Colin Firth, might win), Best Supporting Actress (good chance), Best Supporting Actor (Geoffrey Rush, might win), Best Screenplay (good chance) I thought The Social Network was going to definitely win the Best Picture, but after seeing this, I don't know who's going to win anymore. But it is definitely going down to The King's Speech and The Social Network.",10,0,1,28 December 2010
Black Swan," Black Swan: 9/10
","It is one film of the year where I walk out of the theater and went, Hmm, nice! Well, that doesn't mean it's better than some other films I saw this year, but this is an impressive. Black Swan offers plenty of drama, plenty of thrilling moments, and plenty of sexiness. With a thrilling and perplexed performance by Natalie Portman, and stylish directing from Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan can go far. The story is more complicated than you think it is. It is not just about a ballet dancer, it is about a ballet dancer with deep mental issues. Nina is professional ballet dancer who got promoted to play the key role in a ballet performance, the Swan Queen. With a lot of pressure on her, the story proposes that she is obviously hallucinating about her body being deform. At first, I thought all of this was real because Natalie Portman is so believable. But as the story developed, I know for a fact that this girl has some serious mental issues. A summary about the film really doesn't do it justice, go watch it and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Black Swan demonstrates how ballet is as exciting and thrilling as an action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. Natalie Portman might even win the Best Actress Oscar, that is if she beat Annette Bening (but she already locked herself an Oscar nod). Darren Aronofsky will probably snatch the Best Director nod, but Black Swan will definitely have a chance at the Best Picture run.",9,10,21,12 December 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil 5: 3/10
","After 4 years of the so called evil corporation 'Umbrella', we still haven't gotten tired of this particular franchise. As entertaining as it may seems, we might be getting a little tired of Mila Jovovich being undefeatable (even though she doesn't have any powers in this film) by the undead zombies. The plot is simple and straight forward. Alice (Jovovich) continues her journey on trying to destroy the whole Umbrella Corporation. Joining her this time is Ali Larter (Heroes), Wentworth Miller (Prison Break), and Boris Kodjoe (Undercovers). Not that this cast is any better than its previous instalment. Though it may be in 3D, but few scenes actually worked in 3D. Paul W.S. Anderson's (directed the first Resident Evil) directing is as bad as it can be. The camera angles weren't right and he just doesn't know what to do with the material on his hands. Resident Evil: Afterlife may serve as a treat for fans, but critics find this bad for your teeth.",3,5,11,5 December 2010
Coraline," Maximum Score: B-
","Coraline never liked where she lived, especially her house. She thought everything was boring and there was no adventure or fun. But when she found a little door on her wall, everything changes. I really like the guy directed this film because he's got a great vision and very brave to make a movie this frisky. I would never thought that a producer would take a movie with a plot that is about a little girl who goes into this imaginary world through a door in her wall. This movie gave me chills because of the creepy other mother. I thought this movie should not be rated PG, I mean there were a lot of inappropriate stuff in it. If they were to add some cuss words and some sex scenes in this movie, I like it even better! Visit www.moviereviewsof2009.blogspot.com for more.",7,0,2,24 January 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun of the Dead: 9/10
","Nick Frost and Simon Pegg were delightful in this parody-like British zombie flick. Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a TV store senior staff (or oldest) who had gone nowhere with his life. His 3-year relationship with his girlfriend just ended and he had no idea what his next move is. In the beginning of the film, you see the director trying to foreshadow upcoming events like flashing the news and the radio. After all of that, Shaun and his friends still got no idea that zombies were coming to town. Finding out that they were possibly going to die, Shaun decided to go to a safe place, The Winchester, the bar that he and Ed (Frost) always goes to for comfort. Also deciding to pick up his mom and his ex-girlfriend, Shaun battled through a pile of bloody zombies in a brilliant way. Walking through the streets as though they were zombies, hitting a zombie in a musical rhythm, and missing as he shoots the zombies are great work of director Edgard Wright. It's got a feeling of sensation from Dawn of the Dead, but it also has witty humor from its characters unlike most other zombie flick. Shaun is an uptight store manager that wants to get his life together. Ed is a fat loser who lives with Shaun and play video games all day. When they're together, funny. Even though I stress on how funny it is, Shaun of the Dead is still a horror film with much appreciation for the bloody gore and scares that a typical zombie flick has.",9,1,3,21 March 2011
127 Hours," 127 Hours: 9/10
","Ask yourself before going into this film, am I prepare to watch a guy cutting off his arm (slowly), am I prepare to see James Franco face throughout the entire film? Well, if you're not, see it anyways. Directed by Danny Boyle and starring James Franco, 127 Hours is really another masterpiece after Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. With flashy images and colors, Danny Boyle's style is showing up more in his films. 127 Hours is about a guy cutting off his arm. That is the plot, basic and simple. Aron Ralston is a hardcore biker who loves to climb and one day, just as you predicts, he got trapped. Being stuck in between a rock for 5 days with limited food, little water, no heat, and no restroom can really change a person's point of view. Seeing how he survives the five days feels like I'm watching a camping film. But 127 Hours is more than that, it has this hidden feeling that you feel bad for this guy. With his charming personality, James Franco was able to portray Aron Ralston accurately. This guy was really funny throughout the film even though he had to cut off his own hand. But whenever the movie focuses on how Aron survives, it becomes a movie about survival. This film is strictly about the art of cutting one's hand. 127 Hours gathers all the style of Danny Boyle and put it all together. And with James Franco playing the lead, it couldn't have been better.",9,0,2,5 December 2010
"I Love You, Man"," Maximum Score: C+
","When I first saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it was about a straight guy who got turned. But when I looked closer to it, I was wrong. Paul Rudd played a girlfriend guy in this movie who doesn't have any guy friends, he is getting married so he has to find a best man. He went out and found this guy (Jason Segel) and the problems went on. If I tell you the problems now, it'll spoil the movie. This movie is a fine movie, nothing special. The only thing that stands out is Andy Samberg playing a gay man (; no homo. Visit www.moviereviewsof2009.blogspot.com for more. Jesus Christ, I am suppose to write more than 10 lines so I'm writing bullshit.",7,0,3,24 January 2010
Megamind," Megamind: 6/10
","With an easy blend of comedy and action, Megamind doesn't stand out as one of the animation of the year. But it does however, convince its audience that they will like it coming out of the theater. It is not as slick as The Incredibles and the 3D scenes aren't amazing as How to Train Your Dragon, but you'll enjoy it. Megamind is about a supervillain and a superhero battling since they were born. Megamind, a blue guy with a big head, spends his whole life trying to kill Metroman (Brad Pitt). While the city hates him, he's convince that when he kills Metroman, the citizens will obey him. But when he finally 'killed' Metroman, he found out that his life no longer has a purpose. He has nothing else to do rather than stealing stuff from the city. At this point, I think the movie is trying to get out the message that you have to live life with a purpose, or something like that. But in the end, we know Metroman is alive and Megamind gets locked up again. (There is a whole other subplot that's I'm not going to get in.) Will Ferrell's voice as Megamind is irreplaceable but Tina Fey and Brad Pitt were just unnecessary. Jonah Hill was way better than the two combined but that was because he was one of the big character. They tried to do a lot of stuff in 3D that weren't suppose to work in 3D. But at least they tried. 3-dimensional effects isn't that hard, but I felt like it took them forever in this film and get those effects going. Megamind isn't bad, it is great to say the least. But it lies between the it's-so-bad-that-it's-good type of movie.",6,1,4,5 December 2010
The Town," The Town: 9/10
","Ben Affleck's previous work, Gone Baby Gone, is center around Boston. And in The Town, Ben Affleck revisits his hometown to do nothing more than talk trash on it. He must've really hated this town because both of his movies portrayed nothing but evil of Boston. Nevertheless, The Town is beautifully directed, written with great wit, and acted with much style.The story centers around a bunch of bank robbers who have been successful at what they are doing. But the success comes to an end when Doug (Ben Affleck) decided to have a relationship with hostage Clairre (Rebecca Hall). As the relationship develops, Clairre finds out that Doug is a bank robber and it gets complicated. Meanwhile, Doug was having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's sister Krista (Blake Lively). Being jealous of Clairre, Krista decided to rat Doug and her brother's bank heist to the FBI resulting in a lot of stylized gun fires and great driving scenes. The end is obvious but it has a sad element that Ben Affleck wants the viewers to feel.Writing, acting, and directing the whole film, Affleck's got a lot on his table but still manages to pull off every single role. As a writer, along with two others, Affleck was able to collaborate his knowledge of the Boston language and the wit of actual screen writing. As a director, he was able to direct a great gun fire sequence and a stylish car driving scene. As an actor, Affleck's performance would place second behind Jeremy Renner's. The Oscar winner continues to boost up his already impressive career with The Town.Jeremy Renner isn't new to playing a cocky yet violent guy, but he especially stood out here with his badass attitude. Blake Lively's role was small but she gave it her all. You couldn't see her cuss in a Boston accent and have sex with Ben Affleck in Gossip Girl, could you? Well, there's the other reason to check it out.While filled with much thrillers, the film also showed emotions. Helped by one of this year's best ensembled cast and stylish directing by Ben Affleck, The Town is an award-winning film.OscarBuzz: Best Picture (good chance for a nod, not win), Best Screenplay (guarantee a nod, good chance for win), Best Supporting Actor (Jeremy Renner, good chance for a nod and win)",9,1,2,27 December 2010
Lost in Translation," Lost In Translation: 9/10
","Sofia Cappola is one of Hollywood's directors that can make silent pauses and no dialogue in between movies so irresistibly watchable. Her takes in writing and directing movies within movies isn't new, but there's something new in this, maybe it is in a foreign setting. Movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is going through a mid-life crisis. He went to Tokyo, Japan to promote a liquor drink that was going nowhere. Staying at a hotel and drinking at the bar downstairs everyday, he started seeing a newlywed who's also having a complication in her relationship, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Perhaps the movie's main element isn't the top-notch award-winning script that shaped the movie in every way, or the stylish directing from Sofia Cappola, perhaps it's the unbelievable chemistry between Johansson and Murray (nominated for an Oscar). Lost In Translation really changed Hollywood's perspectives in some ways and Bill Murray/Scarlet Johansson is the best on-screen couple I've seen in years.",9,1,2,8 January 2011
Watchmen," Maximum Score: A-
","This movie is based on the action comic book back in the '80s. Directed by Zack Snyder, I have to say he did a great job on it. I mean except for showing the blue guy's dick, that was very unnecessary. But I thought the movie was very hard to understand if you haven't read the comic series. When you have read the series, however, the movie will seem like awesome to you! I personally didn't read the series, but I will give this movie a good score 'cause I think that if I did read the comic; this would be a great movie.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter: 9/10
","It is a shame that Warner Bros decided to split the franchise into 2 parts, but that was however a very smart move. Even though the movies were made to satisfy the fans, but its main reason was to make more money with Harry, Ron, and Hermoine. We'd watched all three of them grow for a decade, now to think that they're all adults and the franchise is going to be over soon, it is an odd feeling to say the least. The wizard world is corrupting because Lord Voldemort is back with his powers. Even the Ministry of Magic has to hide. The movie takes us on a journey with the three friends rather than giving us a battle between Harry and Voldemort. This is the number one reason fans are complaining about: there wasn't enough action and adventure. But in my opinion, the movie is just building tension for the next one. Even though the film doesn't give much on action, the acting is perfectly where we want it. The three friends give it their all but standing out is Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) and his evil companion Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter). The make-up part in the franchise is always mesmerizing to see. These artists must've worked really hard to have Voldemort's face looked like that! Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 does not disappoints at all, not with its fine acting and brilliant make-up.",9,0,0,5 December 2010
Knowing," Maximum Score: B-
","I've always thought Nicolas Cage was a great actor, and he still is. He especially shines in this movie, played a Earth professor (idk what that's call). He has a son that found a paper and started putting some numbers on that paper together. SH*T! OUR WORLD's GONNA END! Wow. The plot was tight, but the dialogue was just awful.

Salt," Salt: 3/10
","Salt's basic and predictable plot really undermines the film's potential to do more with its lead role, Angelina Jolie. Though the star gave it all she got playing a Russian spy, she wasn't enough to save the film from its wrong pacing style and ridiculously bad plot. Being trained as a Russian spy since she was a little girl, Evenlyn Salt lived a secret second life all this time. She's married and has a dog. But she worked in the CIA, so I guess that's something. Given that Angelina Jolie played the role, we have high expectations that she'd pull it off with lots of dramatic scenes. And that's exactly what we got. From the moment that she was being tortured in North Korea to the moment when she killed her spy partner, she was great. But given the fact that every spy movies starts with an undercover life and being captured at the end, Salt adds nothing new to the genre.",3,2,5,5 December 2010
District 9," District 9: 9/10
","Nominated for Best Picture and some audiences thought it should even win, District 9 is an instant science fiction classic that looks beautiful and entertaining.In 1982, a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population, nicknamed 'The Prawns,' appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty-eight years later, the human are starting to get annoyed by the aliens and want them gone. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley, newcomer) in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends. Although this is his first official acting role, Copley is the best at it. Playing the role like he was an experienced actor, Sharlto Copley was unfortunately snubbed from the Oscar race.The visual effect amazingly vivid and the make up is stunning, but perhaps what is more important is the writing. Writing alien/human interaction is obviously not new, but there is something incredibly refreshing about District 9's script that made the movie all the better. Nominated for an Oscar, Neill Blomkamp's first major writing job is quiet impressive and he's definitely got a career in writing ahead of him.District 9 was absolutely deserving of the Best Picture nomination and perhaps the best science fiction film of 2009.",Null,1,6,30 December 2010
Kick-Ass," Kick-Ass: 7/10
","Dave is a loser with a nerdy comicy brain. No one knew him at his school and his friends are just a bunch of losers. One day he saw a guy being beat up by a bunch of thugs and decided to jump in a help with his superhero costume. The video was captured and became an internet phenomenon. Everyone tried to figure out who was this guy and named his Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass became a pop icon just in days. After hearing about Kick-Ass, hit men Big Daddy & Hit Girl decided to go after him to join him with their group. Going through lots of violence and profanity, Kick-Ass finally got that these two don't kid around. They kill mercilessly, they enjoy taking lives, and they cuss like a bunch of New Yorkers. Kick-Ass is a refreshingly new film that adds to the comic-action-films genre. Kudos to strong performances from crazyass Nicolas Cage and the fouled-mouth Chloe Moretz.

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Cloudy: 8/10
","A delight and delicious to watch, Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs is beautifully crafted, nicely executed, and looked stunning.Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) thinks he's a genius. But none of the things he invented are things that make sense or are useful which is why he shouldn't be inventing things if you ask me. However, he has the support of his mother but when she dies, he's left alone with his father (James Cann) who thinks he should give it up (agree). When the community that he lives in, is in an economic crisis because their primary source of income a sardine cannery was shut down, Flint decides to try his latest invention, a machine that can turn water into food. But something goes wrong and the machine ends up in the atmosphere. Later it starts raining food like hamburgers, pizza, hot dogs, etc... And so the shifty mayor tries to use this as a way to help their community. But when Flint sense something's wrong with the machine, the mayor convinces him to ignore it. But as Flint predict chaos ensues. So not to ruin the story, something bad happened.It is funny and gut-wrenching, but at the same time it is hopeful with Flint's dreams almost coming true. This is Sony Picture's better animations and probably their best of the year.",8,1,1,30 December 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," How To Train Your Dragon: 9/10
","Based on a novel with the same name, writer William Davies was able to turn this kids story into a touching and deep first-class screenplay that is really rare for Dream Works. Hiccup, voiced by the devastating and believable Jay Baruchel, is a weak and low self-esteem little boy who lives in a world of Vikings. His dad and his friends, all around him, their life mission is to kill dragons and Hiccup is expected to do the same. Going through training and a lot of trying, Hiccup was not successful. Instead of killing dragons, Hiccup decided to read books on the dragons and found out they are not that bad. The belief was brought on after Hiccup met a dragon, who was considered the most dangerous dragon and did not try to eat him. This created a interesting but predictable twist for the audience to eat up on. Hiccup named his 'friend' Toothless. Months go by as Hiccup trains his dragon friend Toothless to fly since he was injured when Hiccup found him. Throughout the training, their relationship begins to build and we see that Hiccup is falling in love. The writer really wanted us to cry at this point because Hiccup's friend Toothless was discovered by the town people and he's being killed by them. At the end, we know that dragons aren't as bad and Vikings shouldn't be killing them. This really looks like Disney's work because the message and the tone of the film is based on being friends and nice and all. At first, I thought this was not Dream Work's work, but after checking up on it, I was surprised. This looked more like Disney's cheesy work than Dream Work's. How To Train Your Dragon is classy, funny, kid-friendly, and intelligently scripted. It is one of the best films of the year. OscarBuzz: Best Animated Feature, this will go head to head against Toy Story 3. Even though Toy Story 3 definitely has a lead, if it didn't win, How To Train Your Dragon would snatch the Oscar.",9,4,6,21 December 2010
The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code: 4/10
","The Da Vinci Code (the book) may not be as accurate as it would like to be, but the compelling evidence and convincing writing of Dan Brown's may leave some audience wondering. The book was a ride, the movie, however, can be a little bit mocking. For those who haven't read the book, The Da Vinci Code is about a murder linking path of finding the Holy Grail. Jacques Sauniere was murdered inside the Louvre museum in France, but minutes before his death, Sauniere decided to leave some clues for his granddaughter to solve (just like the old days). The clues weren't leading to his murderer but apparently Sauniere's granddaughter (Sophie) and his colleague (Professor Langdon) were on the path of finding The Holy Grail. The path proved difficulty considering Langdon was wanted for 4 murders (which he didn't commit) and the person who Langdon thought he could trust (Sir Leigh Teabing) betrayed him. It's a great story on paper, but apparently failed to deliver on screen. The source materials is first-class, and considering Ron Howard and Tom Hanks are in this, it would be better than the book.Ron Howard was fantastic at getting the angles of the camera right and making sure there was a good amount of French in the film, but his story telling and directing of the actors were a bit lazy. The sets were mesmerizing and the art direction of the place is award-winning. The Da Vinci Code is such a good looking film but it lacked so much depth and wit from its source materials that we can't help but bag on it. You may be entertain with Tom Hanks himself or the fantastic storyline that revealed some secrets about Jesus, but that is about all.",4,0,0,17 April 2011
The Wrestler," The Wrestler: 8/10
","This is a drama about an aging professional wrestler (Mickey Rourke), decades past his prime, who now barely gets by working small wrestling shows in VFW halls and as a part-time grocery store employee. As he faces health problems that may end his wrestling career for good he attempts to come to terms with his life outside the ring: by working full time at the grocery store, trying to reconcile with the daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) he abandoned in childhood and forming a closer bond with a stripper (Marisa Tomei) he has romantic feelings for. He struggles with his new life and an offer of a high-profile rematch with his 1980s arch-nemesis, The Ayatollah, which may be his ticket back to stardom.Mickey Rourke is always tough, always violent so you can't really expect him to deliver good emotional dialogue. But Rourke said his lines with great emotions and also a sense of toughness underneath. His award-winning performance will be a mark in his long career.Marisa Tomei isn't to be left out either. Playing mom stripper who is attached to this washed-up wresler is probably one of the best thing she done. Looking good yet emotionally strong, Tomei is absolutely perfect for the role.Darren Aronofsky was snubbed from the director race. But the wrestling matches looked stylish and so believable that I think he should've gotten a nod.The Wrestler is a uplifting drama that has a thin premise, but it was built by a great cast and amazing cinematography",8,0,0,30 December 2010
Inception," Inception: 9/10
","With Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, making Inception is another big step towards the Oscars. Although Nolan did not get nominated in 2008 for The Dark Knight, directing Inception will definitely give him a boost in the category. A story taken in a place where we can go into people's dreams and control them completely. Just like Nolan's previous work, Memento, Inception's script is complex yet very entertaining and easy for the audience to understand. Intellectually, Inception is a very high-class film, but the film also demonstrates its dramatic side in which Leonardo DiCaprio comes in. The cast delivered with a sense that they knew exactly what was going on and Joseph Gordon-Levitt added the fun element to the film. Inception is mind-blowing, visceral, and smart, at the same time delivering the biggest Hollywood blockbuster of the year.

","Though its materials are mostly cliché and have been used in Hollywood for a long time, Despicable Me delivers its high-class materials with charms, cute, and heartfelt style. Steve Carrell's voice performance is probably the better ones of voice performances I've seen in years. His cute minions also helped add to the film's quirkiness. Gru, a criminal mastermind voiced by Steve Carrell, was on his way to conquering the world when he ran into three orphan girls and adopted them. Margo, Edith, and Agnes was in a home since they can remember and being adopted by anyone at this point is a joy for them. But after staying with Gru for a day, the kids were horrified. After months of teaching and nurturing, the kids were able to get Gru to be nicer. The story progress with Gru choosing between his evil plan and his kids.

Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3: This Year's Best Animation
","With both of its predecessors receiving a 100% positive feedbacks on RottenTomatoes.com, Toy Story 3 is expected to reach the high standards. And it absolutely does. Toy Story 3 follows the 11 year absent of the two previous films and off the Andy going to college. The toys including Woody and Buzz Lightyear are being donated to a daycare center. The toys were ecstatic about it until they found out that the kids there are disgusting and there is a huge evil bear with a one-eyed baby doll guarding them. Adding adventure to the already interesting plot, Woody and the gang decided to humorously escape the center with great style. Director Lee Unkrich, who is not new at all to the Pixar directing department, he's been responsible for Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and co-director of Toy Story 2. So picking him for the job is not a bad idea. He brought something completely new to the table and turned the story around with twists and thrills. Lee Unkrich had done a decent job of directing this beloved film which had both adults and kids crying their hearts out. From the beginning where Andy's home videos are being played to the end where Andy was saying his final good-byes to the toys, Toy Story 3 is a must-see for all ages and it touched all of our hearts one way or the other.

The director has this crazy attitude to direct a movie that's fun and enjoyable for both the audience and its cast. Considering that people in the cast is elite actors, this is kind of a fun project for them, something enjoyable instead of intense acting. That's what made the movie fun, the cast knew that this isn't that serious and they tried to have fun with it. We felt the charm of Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker.

","I know there are a lot of people who have seen this film and even the sequels. But this is the first time I've paid attention to this franchise. Though it is popular, The Matrix failed to deliver good performances and great fighting scenes. The story is new in its genre and year. The Matrix was created in 1999, which is similar to 2010's Inception, where the world is not the world itself anymore. There are two worlds, The Matrix and the actual world. The Matrix is where most people live in and the actual world is only for the ones that rebelled. As refreshingly new the plot is, the writers just had to put in some clichés in the film: the protagonist did not die at the end, the bad guys died, some romance, and badass action scenes. Well, I guess that's what all movies have nowadays. But the film have so many flaws in it like the acting, it is the worse ensembled cast I've seen in years. The actual writing isn't bad but the way the actors delivered the lines are just unpleasant. Another flaw is the fighting scenes. I first thought it was because they were moving too fast and that was the point. But as it progresses, the fighting scenes are just cheap! The Matrix offers a new element to its genre and has really great visual effects but failed to deliver on its performances which made the film dropped.",5,1,3,17 December 2010
Get Him to the Greek," Get Him: 7/10
","Russell Brand, Jonah Hill, and Diddy. You put all three of them into a movie and you get this hilarious and raunchy comedy. This is probably one of the good comedies of the year 2010. Talk about a bad year in movies, there is practically no good comedies these days. Comedies like Killers, Sex and the City 2, Cop Out, and Furry Vengeance all bombed in the box office and critics hated them. Although Get Him to the Greek is raunchy and full of sex jokes, it still got me laughing my ass off. I enjoyed this very much and writing a long review for a comedy like this isn't my style. But the IMDb guidelines don't allow less than 10 lines of review so forgive the stupid rule and this junk.",7,3,7,5 December 2010
Easy A," Easy A: 8/10
","While Easy A has a cliché plot, it still benefits from its smart script and charming performance from Emma Stone. The film has a plot that is so cliché that whenever Hollywood makes a movie about it, people just tend to overlook it. Unfortunately, people also overlooked this particular film. Easy is not just another Hollywood cliché, it has a script that is fresh and it has a lead that is charming. Rhiannon is a typical school girl who is not that popular. So she's going around spreading rumours about herself: that she slept with a college guy and almost the whole school. While all this is fake, guys are going up to her asking her to spread rumours that she slept with them (in exchange for a gift card to Target.) Although Easy A isn't as funny as it should be, it still manages to entertain me with its amazing (and hot!) Emma Stone.",8,0,0,5 December 2010
Apollo 13," Apollo 13 (classic): 9/10
","Based on a very dramatic event that got the globe coming together at the time praying that the astronauts would be okay, Apollo 13's realistic story and strong performances made it not-better-but-as-good-as the real event. Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third shuttle to land on the moon but an oxygen tank exploded and the astronauts found themselves in a real situation. Going through hell to get back to Earth, the guys finally made it and the world was happy. An interesting story but very simple. Thanks to writers William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert, the story became a complex challenge of life or death situation. Also helped by strong performances particularly from Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan, Apollo 13 became an instant classic when it came out in 1994.",9,1,3,21 December 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Elipse: 5/10
","The Twilight series are just simply not worth ranting about over the net. Sure Taylor Lautner is attractive and sure there is chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson, but the franchise is crap and we all know it. Predictably when they made a successful novel, they will probably turn it into a movie, so there born the Twilight series. Written elegantly by Stephanie Meyers and ruined by Hollywood. Even though in this particular film I admired the CGI effects and the director, it still doesn't make up for the bumpy plot and high school acting. Especially Lautner, all he is good for is pleasing the audience (girls) with his abs and that is not acting (to say the least). Twilight Saga: Eclipse has its goods but there weren't enough to cover its faults.",5,4,8,5 December 2010
The Social Network," The Social Network: 10/10
","Interestingly enough, Hollywood had decided to make a movie about a boring subject, the making of Facebook. The story was supposed to be just a mess with lawsuits and betrayal of friends. But writer Aaron Sorkin turned the story into a must-see of the decade. He turned it into a witty, fast-paced, thrilling, and an Oscar-winning script. Luckily, The Social Network got David Fincher (Curious Case of Benjamin Button) as a director, which makes it even better. David Fincher's achievement in this film is going to score him another Oscar nod. (Fincher is directing The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, English version, my favourite book). The actual Facebook story is about Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard undergraduate (computer genius), who wrote the code for the Facebook website. Teaming up with him was him roommate Eduardo Saverin, whom later sued him for... well lots of **** Mark ran into playboy Sean Parker who convinced Mark to 'betray' his partner (Eduardo), that's what lead to the law suit. Though people say Aaron Sorkin's script is an inaccurate portray of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who in real life is down to Earth and not an **** like in the story, I say he was just trying to make the story A LITTLE more interesting than it already is (sarcasm). Aaron Sorkin not only made the story more interesting, he made it smarter and more thrilling. Performance wise? I will have to admit that I think The Social Network will dominate the Oscars in the acting categories. Jesse Eisenberg gave one hell of a performance! Since he had been playing a loser-with-no-girlfriend kind of guy, this is really typical for him. His fast talking and annoying ass attitude really stole every scene that the camera sets on him. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also gave fine, dramatic performances which MIGHT earn them an Oscar nod. But in terms of Jesse Eisenberg, he is guaranteed an Oscar nomination (he might even win considering there is no other good movies this time of year). Directing, writing, and acting all great in one movie is rare (to say the least). The Social Network succeeds in every assets that the film was trying to achieve.",10,0,2,5 December 2010
The Fighter," The Fighter: 8/10
","Based on a true story of professional boxer Micky Ward, The Fighter is about how Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) fights his way of family and friends to the championship title. Dicky (Christian Bale), Micky's half-brother and trainer, is a drug addict that always fail to show up for training. Their relationship is complicated because Micky wanted more than just a crackhead brother who doesn't know what he's doing. Supporting along that line come Alice (Mellisa Leo), the brothers' mother and manager, who also wants Micky to stay with her and Dicky instead of going to someone better. After meeting the love of his life Charlene (Amy Adams), who convinced Micky that his family's no good, he decided to go on and try something else. Success with the new manager and trainer, Micky got the shot of the title match.Mark Walhberg who plays the boxer is to many critics the lowpoint of the film. Every time the camera focuses on him, it seems like he doesn't have anything to say. Perhaps the writing for Walhberg isn't as concentrated and too vague compare to his co-stars. Walhberg was suppose to carry the film with his role but instead it felt like his co-star Christian Bale did all the heavy lifting. Playing a drug addict who went to jail for resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, Bale (Dicky) was at his best. Emotionally understanding and physically confused by years of sitting on his ass, Dicky's only job was to train his brother into the championship. Bale gave up this amazing vibe that he knows what he's doing but at the same time too confused to do it right. The film, rather than focusing on Mark Walhberg, did a completely different character study on Christian Bale. Carrying along the heavy loads are Mellisa Leo and Amy Adams who played the mother and girlfriend of Walhberg. Leo and Adams had a chemistry in which both hated each other and both share the same goal of helping Dicky. Delivering explicit lines, Amy Adams is the best I've seen her in years. With two Oscar nominations already, she might even earn her third.Though the cast is above average, the writing in some parts were off. It seems like the writers wanted the actors themselves to carry the film without dialogue. They thought they can depend on the actors, but it is impossible for the actors to do any good without a solid script.David O. Russell finely crafted the film, but at times, it looked as if only the fighting scenes count. Focusing too much on the fights instead aiming to offer drama, he made the movie looked like an ESPN fight show. But set aside all of that, David O. Russell's got a talent in him and the fight scenes do look amazing. Perhaps his biggest contribution to the film is his directing of the cast.The Fighter has a predictable plot yet it pulls out so much depth offered by the cast that we can say The Fighter is finely entertaining.OscarBuzz: Best Picture (with 10 nod this year, it will be nominated), Best Supporting Actor (Christian Bale, win), Best Supporting Actress (Mellisa Leo, Amy Adams, both have a good chance), Best Score, Best Cinematography",8,3,4,31 December 2010
