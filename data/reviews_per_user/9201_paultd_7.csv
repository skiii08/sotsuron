United 93," The story of our generation
","We may never know the truth of the events which transpired on that Day, but that is not important here. The official explanation leaves me wanting, but neither do the array of conspiracies seem plausible. But do not let this film become propaganda.See it for what it is, a poignant observation of character intertwined with crumbs of fact, as all the classic cinematic stories before it were. Let us put aside such bickering, and be in awe of humanity never before put on display so vividly.The utter confusion and disbelief that reigned on that Day is so clearly reenacted, the raw emotions so prevalently on display, that one has trouble separating this inspiring story (and it is no more than a story) from reality. We feel we could be seated on United Flight 93. It requires no stretch of the imagination.There are two types of acting. The first emphasizes stirring, larger than life performances often seen from the likes of Pacino. The second kind is so subtle that you forget it's all an act. Neither is the superior form, but for a poignant flashback to that Day, there is no doubt which form is most appropriate.Leave the details to the history books, the news, and the documentaries. Facts are scarce in United 93. Facts are trivial.",10,1,2,6 June 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," One of the very best
","LAWRENCE OF ARABIA contains the most epic cinematography I have ever witnessed, coming from a generation free of CGI. The visuals are breathtaking, and the musical score is no less rousing.Similarly triumphant are the performances of Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, and most of all Peter O'Toole. O'Toole utterly captures the audience with his portrayal of TE Lawrence. He becomes Lawrence, complete with pomp and quirk in one of the defining performances of cinematic history. To ignore the supporting cast is neglectful however. They were all flawless.Billed as an action movie, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA far transcends such classification. The astounding depths of the many layers of this film delve into serious consideration of war, politics, history, and humanity. Each action and each spoken word hold true meaning. Each scene is laid out with an air of importance. Despite this, the movie never feels heavy, and never drags on. There is the finest balance between the gravity of the subject matter and the free spirit in which it is delineated. Expect to be captivated.This is David Lean's masterpiece - a monument of cinema equaled by few, and surpassed by none.",10,1,5,26 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," New guys on the block have totally lost the plot
","My my, what a change of director and screenplay writer can do for a franchise.After the brilliant X1 and the solid X2, we now have main characters solely for comic value (read: The Beast), a plethora of bad and good guys that we can barely keep track of before they're all vaporized anyway, so I ask the makers of the film this: would you rather have Juggernaught Bitch or Gambit, really. We don't need this many heroes, and certainly not this many meaningless ones.Nowhere to be seen is the awe-inspiring Nightcrawler (for reasons explained only in the even more crappy video game), replaced somewhat by the totally ineffective guy with angel wings. Yea, that's right, I don't even know his name. Nor do I care to find out, either. Performing a Deus-Ex Machina requires that you build up some credit beforehand.Let's talk a little about Phoenix. Why does she love standing around so much doing absolutely nothing? And does her execution mean that it is true that some of us are beyond redemption? And why exactly does she mindlessly follow Magneto onto the Golden Gate Bridge fiasco? She doesn't even like him, and is probably aware of what's going on, judging by her remark 'you're just like him (Xavier)'.You know, despite all the overdone explosions occurring every five seconds, Stewart, McKellen, and a select few others manage to turn in some jolly damn good performances. Better even than their contributions to the first two films, I would say. Unfortunately any of the talent being displayed is so completely buried beneath a massive pile of improbabilities and inanities.It's a cardinal rule of film - you can't be killing off your main characters so frequently. The audience will feel disconnected. Another cardinal rule is not to cheapen those deaths by miraculous resurrections (even if they do happen after the credits) or the regaining of powers. I know, I know, this last part was adhering to the comic, but if you don't adhere to the comic in other important areas, why should you here, when it only serves to lessen the emotional impact? There are only hints to some of these, but the hints are essentially foreshadowing, else it would be stupid to give such hints.I am seriously disappointed, and I sincerely hope this is the end of the X-Men films. I don't see how they could possibly produce another coherent offering.",3,2,2,3 June 2006
Schindler's List," A lesson in history
","Standard classroom issue for high school students across the world, SCHINDLER'S LIST is a poignant reminder of the Holocaust. Masterminded by Steven Spielberg and enriched with lamenting tones from Itzhak Perlman, the hearts of these sons of Zion went into the making of this film of films.The viewer is spared none of the harrowing realities of the Holocaust. Jews with proper education were hated the most, and were killed viciously. Some were spared and mocked rather than killed, as long as they provided entertainment for Nazi soldiers. Not all German officers were iron-hearted. Some were driven mad by the slaughtering. As Schindler said best, 'war always brings out the worst in people.' In only a few hours, the film exposed more truths than months spent reading history textbooks.Meticulous attention is paid to the development of characters. At the start, Schindler is shown to be a self-serving, wily businessman who takes advantage of Jewish labour to the benefit of his factory. By the end, the horror he witnesses has transformed him into a saviour. He forgets every dream of wealth he ever held, and agonizes over being unable to save more Jews. Amon Goeth, the commander at the concentration camp in Krakow, is a mirror-image of Hitler. Goeth possesses a blind and irrational hatred of Jews. He kills them for pleasure and considers them to be worthless, yet he is attracted to one named Helen Hirsch. Hitler's similar hypocrisies need not be explained. We are given such polar personalities to consider in this portrayal of the human condition. We are witness to inexplicable kindness and ruthless savagery. Through it all, Neeson and Fiennes give such dynamic performances that we forget we are looking at actors, not men.This is a thoroughly disturbing film. Children who barely know the definition of hate participate in the verbal and physical bombardment of Jews. In countless scenes, families are ruthlessly separated. When Jews are mercilessly shot, the action is quick and brutal. There are no 'Hollywood' deaths. The sequences are all realistically frightening. Another sickening scene shows Amon Goeth sniping Jews from his balcony simply for enjoyment and target practice. It is hard to imagine such twisted men could exist. Elsewhere, Jews rub their own blood on their faces to look livelier and stand a better chance of being selected for work. Why? Unselected individuals are gassed. After a shake of our heads, we realize that these horrifying details are a testament to the film's true quality.There is good reason for the lack of colour. It helps emphasize key moments of the story featured in colour, such as the vibrant candles that are lit for a Jewish couple's marriage. Colour signifies hope, and is used sparingly as hope is not something that existed in any great quantity during those days.In many ways, this is a unique film for Spielberg. He has departed from providing glowing, satisfying, heart-warming cinema. Yet there are bold elements of action and adventure passed on from his earlier works. Look how Schindler's suspenseful dealings with suspicious German officials are played out. See how he dramatically saves the Jews on numerous occasions. We are kept to the edge of our seats by methods only Spielberg could conjure.Steven Zaillian provides an immaculate script. Nothing feels out of time or place. A few have complained that the spoken language is unauthentically English. Does it matter what language the Holocaust is portrayed in? Can the impact be reduced in any way? Nothing is changed, for the message is universal.When one thinks back to the Holocaust, one thinks of despair. Within the hopelessness rose an unlikely hero. This movie is a tribute to the Jews, to their struggle, and to the gentile who lent a righteous hand.",10,9,13,16 June 2006
The Untouchables," Unspectacular
","There's nothing tragically wrong with Brian De Palma's THE UNTOUCHABLES. Yet as the credits roll, I'm left with the undeniable feeling that this wasn't so great.When you see a great movie, it hits you fast and sure. There's no doubt. Kevin Costner's performance on the other hand left me with a lot of doubt. I'm left wondering if the real Eliot Ness could have possibly been as one-dimensional in his pursuit of honourable justice. Even more disappointing is Robert De Niro as Al Capone. We are given no insight into the brilliant criminal mind of Capone. What we see is an articulate gangster who throws an abundance of hissy fits. Still, the sheer energy that De Niro brings is refreshing to watch.Arriving to rescue the film are Sean Connery and Andy Garcia. Connery is decidedly not an Irishman, but who's paying attention? In Malone we see a man beyond the basic notions of justice, and we are genuinely touched by his death. I could hardly say the same if Ness had bit the bullet. Garcia's character is convincingly mysterious. He wants to be a cop, and I'm eager to know the reason.There's no shortage of cringe-worthy scenes, reminding us of the supersaturated and clichéd state of the gangster movie genre. One example can be found in Costner's refusal of a bribe from the mob early on in the film. Another can be found in the stupidly heroic shotguns-blazing liquor convoy raid at a bridge in Canada. To compensate, there are some great moments like the train station arrest of Capone's bookkeeper.It should be mentioned that the whole movie strikes with a less than serious surreal attitude, which was pivotal to SCARFACE, but incompatible with the very real story of Al Capone.In the end, the movie works. I enjoyed it, and that's more important than anything else.",5,2,5,11 June 2006
The Godfather: Part III," Disappointing addition to the Godfather legacy
","Just saw it again without seeing the first two in years, and it's even worse than I remember. I don't feel any connection to the characters, some scenes are nonsensical, and I leave with a taste of 'what was the point of that.' Compare Al Pacino here with Al Pacino in DONNIE BRASCO, and you can see he wasn't crappy here because he got old. It's not his fault. The whole project is simply a massive failure.All the dialogue that seemed so slick and smart in the first two films has disappeared, replaced with monotonous 3-liners. Don't even get me started about assassination by glasses. You don't have to compare this movie with its namesakes either. Just see how it matches up with GOODFELLAS, a movie released around the same time.So in essence, what makes this movie good? Is it the worn out tried and tested formula being (mis)used? Is it the complete lack of wit? Is it the amateur quality flashback methods? Is it the fact that none of the actors really seem interested? Is it Sofia Coppola? None of those are part of my good movie criteria.The film does work better than it should, and it's all because of the help it gets from the previous two. If this were considered as a stand-alone product, it would appear much, much, much worse.",3,10,16,22 May 2006
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Great battle scenes, underwhelming otherwise
","What we have here is a thoroughly captivating movie with noticeable flaws. Despite the great battle scenes, there were just too many battle scenes. We only need to see a bayonet go through someone so many times. Also, there are preposterous Superman worthy combat heroics that detracts from an otherwise gruesome and very realistic wartime setting that surpasses even that of Saving Private Ryan.Besides the action sequences, the other parts seem overly melodramatic, playing loosely like a Bollywood movie (without the crappy dance interludes, for which I'll give it credit). This movie tries, really hard, to make you cry, really hard. Manipulative music that wrestles you to submit to your emotions is played not once or twice, but all the way through. An alternative would be soft notes or even total silence in the crucial scenes. That would have really hit the message home harder.Lastly, the character shifts occur too whimsically. There is no reason for the two brothers to take on such a fast array of different behavioral costumes. One moment they feud, and the next moment they forget all about it. The older brother's reckless insanity was way over the top.That might seem to indicate that I hated this movie, but I don't. It was done very well within the scope it provides itself. It is rewarding, touching, and insightful for anyone, more so those unfamiliar with the Korean War. Just don't expect a real accurate history lesson, but the general gist is provided along with heavy feel-good (or is it feel-bad?) factor. The film-makers understood this film's formulaic purpose and really weren't too interested in pushing the envelope.",5,4,17,22 May 2006
