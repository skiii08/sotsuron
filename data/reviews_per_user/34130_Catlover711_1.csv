Walk the Line," Utterly Fantastic Movie!!!!!
","First, I've loved Johnny & June for as long as I can remember, so I am biased in favor of this movie. Joaquin Phoenix has got Johnnies moves and facial expressions down to a 'T'! He somewhat resembles Johnny anyway, and in some scenes, you can almost believe that you are seeing the actual Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon makes an excellent June Carter and sings a little like June. This movie is a real life love story with a happy ending and that made it my kind of movie. One part of this movie in particular I really liked was when the Carter's were keeping everyone away from Johnny in order to dry him out. His pill peddler shows up and Ezra and Mother Maybelle chase him off with shotguns. Seeing Mother Maybelle with a shotgun is hilarious!! All the actors were excellent, the directing superb, the script riveting. It was everything I hoped for and more!! I believe Johnny and June would be happy with this movie.",10,2,7,18 November 2005
