The Avengers," watch and learn Michael Bay
","have to say this was probably one of the best super hero movie I've seen in a long time. actors are inserted are of very high status. special effect are of the highest caliber. story is surprisingly good. crooks works really well. the small elements with comical output is some but gruesomely good. I also think the characters work well together. I've never been a fan of the Hulk, but this is probably the best film he's in. The iron man is in his best form and all the other works really well with them.   I can recommend this film to anyone who likes action movies full speed, you will not regret it. have to say this was probably one of the best super hero movie I've seen in a long time. actors are inserted are of very high status. special effect are of the highest caliber. story is surprisingly good. crooks works really well. the small elements with comical output is some but gruesomely good.

Paranormal Activity," Paranormal Activity is like a Big Brother episode..
","Awful!!! i watched this movie today like 1 hour ago.. and i must say that it was the most awful movie ever! Just thinking of it makes me angry. i waste my time and money too this junk?! And why is it like a big brother episode? It is more awful then a big brother episode! do you see??!! don't watch this movie! the story is junk the actors sucks. the scary jump scenes.. ? i didn't see any. the movie just bored the hell of me. at least in a big brother episode you can see naked chicks, and believe me for my rating 1 star for this movie is for the big jugs on the girl in the movie. they was the only thing keep me in this piece of ass movie",1,3,4,5 January 2010
