Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not What I Expected Or Hoped For
","Simply not in the same universe as the first three films. Characters either poorly developed or under-untilized. Far too much reliance on special effects. Muddled storyline. JAR-JAR BINKS. His character alone is enough to keep me from watching the film again. Not knocking his imagination, let's hope that Lucas draws upon talent other than his own to make the next film work as well as the first three.",6,0,1,26 October 1999
The Hunger Games," Enjoyable but very flawed
","Overall it is great to see the novel brought to life on the big-screen. First of all, kudos to the actors - each does a marvelous job with their roles. Harrelson, Lawrence, Hutchinson, Tucci, Banks and the rest of the cast - they all nail their characters and do them honor.The heart of the story is intact, unfortunately there are many significant elements from the novel entirely missing, or changed to the point they lose the depth of meaning they were intended to have. Unlike some of the sub-plot and story elements left out of the Potter and LOTR series, these missing and adulterated items matter greatly, and lessen the quality of the movie. I will give the producers credit for building Seneca Crane's role in an effective way that answers many questions for those that have not read the books.Finally - production values. You will suffer significant eyestrain after 2.5 hours of glaring close-ups. All of the action is shot so close and is so muddled it is almost impossible to determine what is happening. The chariot display is shown either to close or too far away, and in both cases so fast that the impact of the glorious entrance and introduction of the tributes is lost. The CG shots (thankfully there are few of them) look like leftovers from a Syfy channel production. This may be the worst big-budget production to hit the big screen in years. Although Ross worked well with the actors, he did not handle the action epic elements well at all. The cinematography is atrocious and the whole production looks cheap.You will enjoy the movie, but you will also wish for the grand and respectful care-taking that was given the Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises.",7,19,41,23 March 2012
The Thin Red Line," Even Nick Nolte Couldn't Save This One....
","Other than an exceptional performance by Nick Nolte this is one of the worst big production movies I have ever suffered through. The film is tedious, the plot nonexistant, the action unfocused, the flashbacks utterly boring. Nolte is at his absolute best, but even his performance can't save this one. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can find anything at all better to with three hours of their life.",2,0,0,23 November 1999
