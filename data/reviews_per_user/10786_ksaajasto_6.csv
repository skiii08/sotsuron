The Blair Witch Project," One of the worst movies i've seen since 'Epic Movie'
","This movie is way overrated. the entire movie consists of three people walking through the forest. And the camera is just looking at forest, and stacks of rocks and such. Anyone with a movie camera can make a movie like this. there is literally NOTHING exciting in the entire movie. all of the information is in the conversations which take up the whole movie. when i finished watching this garbage i thought - i'll never get back those 87 minutes i wasted. final view - don't watch this movie, its boring, and not scary, an all around failure.",2,1,4,27 July 2007
Scarface," breathtaking...
","This movie is my all time favorite! the story is about a communist hating Cuban named Tony Montana. Tony is involved in a series of drug deals, and murders, he is neglected by his mother, but his sister Gina still has faith in him. This movie starts as a immigration thing, but it keeps getting more and more complex until it finally twists and crashes in the end, causing a superb, fabulous, breathtaking ending that i guarantee you will not forget. if you are a die hard fan of the second greatest movie ever made (Godfather) you will love this action packed dramatic film. Not only do I recommend you to see it, buy it, and buy posters and everything, there are millions of them. best movie in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,2,15 June 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disgusting, Disturbing, And absolutely Hilarious
","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to this film with my older brother. I had heard about all kinds of controversy over it... and no wonder. If you are extremely sensitive when people talk about Jews, Gypsies, or Retards... this movie is NOT for you.One other thing that no one else warned me about... There is a GRUESOME AMOUNT OF CLOSEUP SICK NUDITY. I only saw the label on the 'R' but i wasn't expecting that... so you were warned.I loved this movie, but if you aren't sure if you want to see it or not, check out the clips and trailers at Yahoo.com and if you like them... you will like the rest of the movie.My mother wanted to see this movie, and i promised her that she would NEVER want to see this movie. But, this is a perfect film for college students. You cannot stop laughing.Thanks For Reading KS",8,1,7,11 November 2006
Saw II," Not as good as the first
","I'm not a big fan of hardcore Horror like this, but I like the first Saw a whole lot. So obviously I wanted to see the second one. but I made the mistake of buying it. In the first Saw movie, there were only two people trapped in the room. But now they added an extra 6 or seven people. which in my opinion made the movie a lot less gripping. But this movie the parts that really turned me off had to do with NO PLOT WHATSOEVER, and dirty, used needles. This movie is worth seeing, if your interested in this stuff. it is most certainly the same style as the first one. Except the first one had a plot, and overall a good story. I don't recommend that you buy this movie until you have seen it before, and liked it immensely. I don't know how you could though. I will most likely choose not to watch the third Saw. because that looks pretty crappy too.",6,0,0,29 May 2006
Identity," Superb!!!
","I absolutely love this movie!!!, the story is a very interesting one. And it is great how all the things clear up in the end. I think that Ray Liotta is the best actor in this movie. he does a superb job in it. The movie is about a group of people who are trapped in horrible weather, and are forced to stay at a Motel. The movie is 'gripping!' with a mix of Horror, and mystery I give this movie 10 stars. I just bought this movie yesterday, and I've watched it three times already. This movie has several (three) , abrupt, unexpected twists right in the end. I won't spoil it though, buy this movie!!! find out yourself! You absolutely MUST watch this movie! It is awesome!",10,0,1,28 May 2006
Donnie Darko," Awesome!!!! (summary from a 14 year old)
","This movie is superb. I enjoyed it very much. The movie itself would have ten stars, but it is the kind of movie that you would only want to watch once or twice. Therefore I lowered it to a 9. The actors in this movie are all very good. And the plot line is amazing. I highly recommend that you buy this movie. I currently own the VHS version, this version, and the regular DVD version. If you like movies that make you think, or have twists in the end, this movie is the one for you. A+ If you enjoyed this movie I would also strongly recommend the movie 'Identity'. It is very much the same. It has Holmes (Donnies father) in it. I have talked to my friends at school, and they have all agreed with me that this movie is awesome. Thanks for taking the time to read my comment.",9,1,3,28 May 2006
