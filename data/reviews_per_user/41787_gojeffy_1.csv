Walk the Line," Definitely has Oscar written all over it.
","Great performance, wonderful. One of the best movies of the year. Phoenix did a swell performance on Johnny Cash. Better than is role in the movie Ladder 49. This movie is definitely recommended. The movie I last say him in before Ladder 49 was Signs. Is it just me or has he become a better actor since then? I don't think this movie is getting the attention it deserves. I suppose that's what you get releasing around the time Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire comes out. All, well I was still very impressed. I did see him in 8mm starring Nicholas Cage. That was quite the ****ed up movie but the director was the one from Seven. Compared to being a country star he played an employee of an Adult store. I must say 8mm was quite more disturbing than Walk the Line.",9,0,1,11 December 2005
