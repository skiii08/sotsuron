Skyfall," Skyfall, A Worthy Addition To The Bond Legacy
","Finally got to see Skyfall today at the Dine-In AMC Theater in Marina Del Rey, California. Wanted to go to the Landmark in Westwood, but time did not permit. The AMC was nice though at least at first sit with electric recliners and food and bar service right in the theater similar to the Alamo Brew House in Austin. When the film started a few things bugged me though. People tend to feel a bit more like they're in their living room in this environment which means a bit more talking. Its not a stadium seating room, but the main bone to pick is the night lights in between each seat which seemed overly bright during the screening. As far as Skyfall itself, I really liked the film. Adele's title track wasn't strong enough, but all in all a good Bond film which helps erase the mental trauma of that most terrible of films, Quantum of Solace. Skyfall feels like a Bond film. The opening sequence is very good and the shots are wide enough so we know where we are as it unfolds. The film itself has enough tense scenes and calm scenes to have great pace and engage the audience. Unlike Quantum of Solace you actually care about the characters, good and villainous, and it has a story, an honest to goodness story. Mendes did a good job of direction and Deakins Arri Alexa photography was gorgeous. I did not see the Imax version which I thought would be useless since the film wasn't shot in Imax, but the version I saw looked great with no noticeable digital artifacts. I still think the first five Sean Connery Bonds are the best of course, but Skyfall is a worthy addition to the Bond legacy. Now if only I could erase Quantum of Solace from my memory. Unfortunately nothing short of a lobotomy will do that and I'm not ready to go that far at this juncture. Skyfall is good. Casino Royale is the better Daniel Craig Bond, but Skyfall is a close second. If you haven't seen it go. You'll get quite the ride.",10,1,10,6 December 2012
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Solace?
","I really wanted to like Quantum of Solace, but try as I might it just wasn't possible. This film did not work on any level and since I love Bond films and count the days until their release I was very disappointed to find that Quantum of Solace wasn't worth the wait. I would say it's the worst Bond film ever, but I can't because it wasn't really a Bond film at all. It did have James Bond in it, but that's where the similarity ends. The opening sequence was unwatchable with bad cuts coming at me so quickly no information was to be had until the title sequence began. Then there was the awful theme song. I mean, I like the White Stripes and all, but really where's Shirley Bassey when you need her? The rest of the soundtrack isn't any better. Music just seems to be arbitrarily placed to fill up space with no relationship to the scenes at hand. Photographically most of the action sequences are largely out of focus and shot so closely no tension what so ever builds during the entire length of this film. This results in a lack of danger being felt and a separation of the audience from the film itself. You never care about the characters and that is the death of any film. The story is thin and full of holes. Actually there is not much story at all. Seems like the filmmakers got spooked by the Bourne films and tried to make something comparable but just ended up with a washed out watered down version of a bad Bourne film. Sad really. There is one good part. Near the end, for a split second, a small snippet of the original Bond theme is played. That's the only thing about this film worth anything. It is such a bad day for Bond to have this drivel put out to represent what Bond has meant for the last 45 years. As I said earlier, usually I can't wait for the release of next Bond film. During the screening of this disaster I couldn't wait for it to end and release me from the theater. What a painfully sad and irresponsible destruction of the Bond legacy.",1,34,49,18 November 2008
Mulholland Drive," Brilliant! A Masterpiece!
","Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is the Master of cinematic expression. At the screening last night I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are astounding, the score entrancing, and the photography mesmerizing. David's ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is unequalled. As I watched Mullholland Drive I couldn't help but realize that with David Lynch in this world we are truly blessed. The cinema is blessed as well for, in the films of David Lynch, we are shown that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only path. We realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed.",10,4,5,5 June 2001
