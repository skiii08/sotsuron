Sucker Punch," 'Sucker' was right for at least part of the title
","I could have walked out of this movie after the first 5 minutes and not missed a thing. You know when you go to a movie and you can tell within the first few seconds whether or not it's going to be a good movie? Well, I got that feeling that it wasn't going to be any good and to my suspected notion, it wasn't. I was hopeful to see some hot chicks kicking butt, but that just did not happen. There is nothing worse than seeing hot chicks that cannot fight to save their a$$, moving in slow motion to disguise that fact, and then see them whip everyone in sight just because that is supposed to be what happens in the script and that is EXACTLY what happened. Over and over again. They could have taken a good lesson from Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass. Now that girl could fight and I could watch her fight all night long, because it was cool, interesting, and she could act. The acting in this movie was horrible. With the exception of Scott Glenn's scene in the end I felt nothing for any of the characters and it was like watching bad auditions.The scenes/characters were very reminiscent of other films like Lord of the Rings, Hellboy, Batman, etc. For the most part I was just waiting for it to be over so that I could leave.I really thought that they could have done so much more than they did.",1,97,201,25 March 2011
The Hunger Games," What a big let down
","I could have easily walked out of this movie in the first 10 to 15 minutes and not thought twice about it. You know how you can kind of tell whether or not the movie is going to be any good in the first few minutes, and you are usually right. Well, that was this movie, and it didn't look promising and it wasn't.First, the movie was way too long. They took a lot of time to do nothing.Second, I could not stand all of the camera shaking. It started to give me a head ache. Luckily, it seemed like it was only during the first third of the movie (maybe they switched cinematographers after the beginning?). It was a lot like when your kids take the camera and forget that it's on while they are walking around.The fight scenes were mostly lame and the camera angles were clearly uncreative (not there there had to be great fight scenes, but you would have thought with all of the time they used on screen they would have done something with the time!).Character development was nill. Only the main character was developed and I didn't really care for any of the others since they were completely unknown to me.I would not even watch this movie again if it came out on DVD. To me it was a completed waste of the afternoon and my $8.I thought that the actor's performances were great, but there was just nothing there to pull the viewer in to get them involved in the story. I also really didn't get why they were having to compete in this game (I guess that you had to read the book and already be familiar with the subject) and it seemed like I had already been through this type of scenario before.",2,31,55,16 April 2012
The Love Guru," Just Austin Powers rehashed
","Just could not get into this from the beginning. I had heard it all before and it was just more of the same. There were a couple of funny moments and I would expect no less from Mike Myers. I mean the whole thing could not be bad.Justin Timberlake gave a good performance but it was uneventful and boring. There was one great scene with a radio that everyone will love (and did). Jessica Alba was eh. Verne Troyer was right on and gave one of the better performances in the film, although none of the performances were memorable. If you're a big Mike Myers fan, wait for the DVD, unfortunately, as hopefully there were be better footage on the behind the scenes takes.It just missed the mark and did not offer anything that had not already been done before.",3,6,16,23 June 2008
District 9," Just Horrible
","I could not get into this movie at all and in fact I slept through at least half of it. This was the same review that everyone in my party gave with the exception of my 18-year-old daughter. I really could have spent my time more wisely.The cinematography was just horrid and the film was so jerky that you could never really enjoy what might have been happening.I thought that none of the characters were likable until the very end of the movie and how did they ever learn to understand the aliens (must have slept through that part). You didn't really care about any of the characters until the end of the movie.I did not like that the movie was narrated to me (in parts). If you have to tell me what's going on then it must be to complicated to enjoy.Seemed like the same old alien stuff that I have seen over and over where they take aliens and dissect them to learn more about them and harness their weaponry. Wait for the DVD if you must see it. If there's a sequel (which they have set up in the movie, in 3 years), I'll wait for that DVD for sure.If you like fictional documentaries you might like this film, but then again, maybe not.",1,23,50,17 August 2009
Drive," Worst (or one of) Movie of the Year
","This has to be one of the worst this year. After reading some of the other reviews I had to wonder just what movie did the other reviewers see OR do they just not get out that much OR have they never really seen a movie before. I went to this movie thinking that it was a remake of the 1978 The Driver with Ryan O'Neal, which was just a great movie (which I'm going to have to purchase after seeing this lame want-to-be imitation, that didn't even come close). To start:The music was horrible and for the most part just drove me and my son to want to leave within the first 20 minutes. You know how you can sometimes tell how good (or how bad) a movie will be just by listening to the music in the opening (and throughout). Well this was clearly one of those movies. I stayed because of all of the great reviews on IMDb thinking that the move would redeem itself in the near future, but it never happened. The cast was okay and their performances were, eh... But Gosling's character was for the most part a sociopath and was in NO WAY like the Steve McQueen characters of old. Very disappointed in the other reviews making this comparison as I am a huge McQueen fan. It just wasn't there.The action:There was none really. And there definitely was not any driving and what 'was' there was very poor. I kept waiting on some cool chase scene or trick move that would happen and of the three driving scenes that I remember, but I think there were only two, they just fizzled. Nothing to watch there. Even the opening driving scene was just lame. Nothing cool. Nothing clever.Do your self a favor and don't go and see this movie. Wait until it's out on DVD and rent it or wait for the TV version. You won't be missing anything.",1,31,65,18 September 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Worst movie I've seen in 10 years.
","Out of 2 and 1/2 hours there is only about 15 to 20 minutes of real acting. The rest is just non-stop chaos and the robot scenes seem rushed and unrefined. It was almost like there was a lot of left over footage from the first Transformers that was used here to meet a quick turn around time.Although there were a number of gorgeous and handsome actresses and actors, you hardly got to really see them for very long. What a waste that was. What were they thinking? I don't know.And when did the Transformers enlist the help of a terminator? You'll see what I mean when you see the college hottie. I never knew that Transformers could have skin.Just a bad movie. I would have walked out had it not been for one of my children. The other one was asleep through most of the movie.",1,11,25,29 June 2009
