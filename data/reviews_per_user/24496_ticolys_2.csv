Iron Man 3," Great Movie
","There are only 2 things I found disappointing in this movie.. The first is the fact that the suits brake extremely easy... I mean, in the first 2 movies we see Iron Man as an incredible and powerful suit of armor and now it gets destroyed every time it hits a metal pole or something.. Indeed it does give some WTF effect and it's little bit funny but it kinda became overused..Another thing that I found a slight bit disappointing was the film's main 'antagonist', the Mandarin, which on the end turned out to be just some simple actor...Now I didn't read the Iron Man comics but I did grow up watching the animated series and the Mandarin was an immensely powerful villain and Iron Man's nemesis, making the way he is pictured in the movie the complete opposite of what he really was..Apart from these two things, the movie was great; the effects were amazing, the music was awesome and we had a beautiful performance from all the actors, making the movie the best way to start a summer...",8,1,9,30 April 2013
The Hangover Part III," Could have been a lot worse...
","The movie isn't a total failure after all... Although they have changed the formula from the first 2 films, the movie would have been somewhat better in my opinion if it was more like the first 2, making the scene at the end the only thing that stayed true to this franchise. The plot was pretty stupid and the whole film is pretty much only based on only 2 characters, Alan,played by Zach Galifianakis and Mr Chow, played by Ken Jeong, making the others rather forgettable.Overall.. This movie could've been a lot better if they thought of a better plot. Rating: 4(+1 for ending scene) = 5",5,1,2,7 June 2013
