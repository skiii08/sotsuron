Casablanca," A classic that ALMOST stands the test of time
","Casablanca is one of the gems of the 1940s that is so far ahead of its time in terms of cinematography that one can scarcely believe it is not a mock black-and-white classic made up to 50 years later. Joining the realms of Citizen Kane and It's a Wonderful Life, this is one of the early pieces that evolved into what we know cinema to be today.
A cliched and simplistic plot aside, Casablanca features some of the most well-known dialogue in the world of film up to 70 years after its release. It is a marvel of screenwriting and cinematography that has stood the test of time.
What makes it all the more fascinating to watch is the depiction of World War II themes in a film that predates the Nazi surrender, granting us the perspective of Western artists in the midst of wartime who were unsure whether victory or defeat awaited them, and when. The idea of war gains a more sinister and hopeless tone in this context.
Casablanca, however, does fall victim to some elements of the story that struggle to stand up to today's standards in an industry that produces wonderful films by the dozen. Cliché is the primary word that comes to mind, and while Casablanca outdates many films that follow the same tropes, it certainly did not invent the romance genre, and it does little to stray from the often cringeworthy tricks of the romance-writing trade.
It also struggles in terms of pacing, often feeling like the story is meandering towards a conclusion with little causality or flow.
Nonetheless, the cinematography is an absolute marvel, and the performances of 1940s megastars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are typically magnificent. Casablanca is worth a watch to enjoy the roots of the film industry we see today and some of the pioneering storytelling that defines the way artists continue to produce wonderful cinema.",7,4,6,2 May 2019
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Has the guts to say it, and says it
","This movie lived up to the expectations that come with bearing Monty Python's title and even exceeded them. While perhaps playing second base to 'The Holy Grail', 'Life of Brian' was a hysterical look at the time of Jesus' crucifixion, and is driven by a clever, yet simple, driving plot. The ridiculousness of the comedy is what truly makes Monty Python films, and the plot of this masterpiece was utterly ludicrous. This is not to mention the absurd understatement of moments, childish laughter at profanity, and hyperbolic stupidity of characters. Like most comedies of the era, though, 'Life of Brian' is marred by cliché and cringe-worthy, corny jokes. While this suits Monty Python perfectly, and cannot be considered cliché due to Monty Python's role in bringing such comedy to the mainstream, it is a little bit painful to watch at times from the modern age. Nevertheless, 'Life of Brian' is hilarious British comedy at its finest, mocking a part of history that films today seem to lack the courage to even touch. Few films make a mockery of religion and the Jewish people of the first century like this one does.",7,0,2,6 January 2017
Se7en," Neatly woven, dark and Fincher at his best
","Se7en epitomises the work of David Fincher - graphic, introspective works with clever colour palettes, wonderful cinematography, word-perfect writing and equally intelligent use of music. And this one ranks amongst Fight Club and Gone Girl as his all-time best.However, this is also a film characterised by its iconic performances. In a similar vein to The Silence of the Lambs, it is the antagonistic performance that lasts barely an act that steals the show from top-class performances from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. Kevin Spacey's performance as John Doe is chilling to the bone, masterful and truly iconic as one of the greatest cinematic murderers in history.The work on screen of Freeman, Pitt and Spacey, as well as Gwyneth Paltrow, is highlighted by Fincher's mastery behind the camera. This is a murder mystery that is not afraid to be chilling, disturbing and disgusting. It delves into the depths of human nature and emerges bloody and deranged.Finding its basis in the Seven Deadly Sins, Se7en weaves an intricate mystery that grips the audience from the beginning and is a true revelation when it comes full-circle. The infamous ending of the film is emotional, raw and mind-boggling in every sense of all three words. The chemistry of the performances are best seen in those final minutes, from the grieving Pitt to the psychopathic Spacey.Se7en ticks every box that I look for in a film. A masterful story, appealing visuals and cinematography, gripping performances and a roller coaster ride of emotions. If you haven't seen it yet, treat yourself. This is one of the must-watch pieces of cinema for every film fan.",10,1,1,24 April 2019
Citizen Kane," An absolute masterpiece that surpassed its generation
","Citizen Kane, the genius masterpiece of Orson Welles, is a piece of film that, despite the limited technology, technique or industry available to filmmakers in the early 1940s, still stands today as some of the best cinematography and writing in the history of film. With a thoroughly engaging plot, fantastic technique and ridiculously advanced cinematography for the time, this is one of the rare black and white films of the 1930s and 40s that still engages and captivates audiences today. It is a truly stunning mystery film, with an interesting structure and a unique, original story-line that remains as relevant as ever, 76 years after the film's release. Indeed, in my opinion, there will never quite be another film like Citizen Kane. Orson Welles is, and deserves to be, one of the most renowned pioneers of the film industry - and this is his greatest masterpiece. What a film.",Null,1,3,23 February 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Utterly amazing
","As a Star Wars fan, I can honestly say that for the first ninety minutes of this film, I was utterly unimpressed. After the excitement and pleasure that was 'The Force Awakens', the first two acts of 'Rogue One' were a dull disappointment with only brief moments of nostalgic excitement - but they were more than justified and redeemed by the thrilling third act that truly glued the film together. The brief moments of Darth Vader's cameo and the reintroduction of Grand Moff Tarkin were impressive, and the visual effects stunned, while the performance of Mads Mikkelsen was utterly spell-binding. But it wasn't until the Tobruk-esque third act that I truly appreciated the beauty of this film. Its dramatic climax, including a showing of the true power of Darth Vader, a reveal of Princess Leia, and an emotional and incredible battle scene to rival the best of Star Wars, was far beyond my expectations and justified the re-shoots of the third act tenfold. While the characters seemed cliché at times, Felicity Jones and Diego Luna performed fantastically and were contrasted beautifully by the performance of Ben Mendelsohn as the film's primary antagonist. I can only commend the writers and directors on the risks they were willing to take with this darkened, gritty approach to the Star Wars universe, and say that every single one of the risks paid off in the end. Utterly amazing.",Null,2,5,6 January 2017
12 Angry Men," An example of what Hollywood today has lost
","12 Angry Men stands as one of the greatest films ever made, and a testament to the brilliant storytelling of Sidney Lumet, and performances of Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb in particular.
This film stands to show that action sequences, special effects and intricate mysteries are not necessary to tell the perfect story. Taking place within a room and leaning entirely on its beautifully-written dialogue and wonderfully-portrayed characters, 12 Angry Men still manages to capture attention and imagination from start to finish.
Lumet utilises long, perfectly-choreographed shots that sustain the tension and aggravation that builds between the twelve jurors over the course of the film. Every movement has significance, and every drop of sweat is symbolic. This film was planned to the finest detail.
The dialogue is pure brilliance, and the unravelling of the plot is perfectly paced. Lumet manages to open the film on a seemingly certain guilty verdict, even from the audience's perspective, and build a case through logic and reason that completely sways not only the twelve jurors, but the audience within the space of the film.
The performances of Fonda and Cobb in particular are excellent. Every one of the twelve leads had perfected their characterisations, to the point that we immediately liked the likable characters and disliked the antagonists. Fonda is typically brilliant, standing as the one defiant juror, while Cobb's energy is fantastic in a difficult role.
It is no wonder that this film has been parodied and referenced through the last fifty years of Hollywood's history. In fact, it has remained such a part of popular culture that almost any film fan would recognise the film immediately without having ever heard of it before. Its impact on film over the past half-century has been undeniable.
12 Angry Men is the epitome of minimalist storytelling and certainly a peak of filmmaking. This is an example of the plot- and character-based film working to perfection in a Hollywood industry that so frequently gets these films exactly wrong.",10,2,2,27 April 2019
Moana," Only beaten by Zootopia
","Two words: beautiful, spellbinding. This is perhaps among Disney's best since their venture into 3D animation, with the most spectacular animation I've seen in any film. The beauty of the visual effects was complemented by the well-written plot and songs, the gorgeous voice of Auli'i Cravalho, and the typical Disney comic relief through Heihei and Pua. My only criticism could be two things: there were a few moments that seemed slightly mis-paced, such as Maui's defeat by Te Ka, learning to use his hook again and the appearance of Gramma's ghost, which all seem to have been rushed elements of the plot. Further, some of the characters and plot points seem slightly cliché - however, the clichéd plot elements can be forgiven thanks to the exploration of a largely unnoticed culture on Earth, the spellbinding music, and the fantastic animation. Dwayne Johnson was a pleasant surprise in the role of Maui. Originally, I was concerned that he did not suit the style of the character, nor the typical voice actor that Disney animation movies needed. But, he lived up to the role and then some. Maui was funny, lovable and bad-ass, and he added so much to the film through his joking arrogance and humour. This is, in my opinion, Disney's second-greatest modern animation. While it doesn't appeal in the same manner as 'Frozen', I feel that it was better-executed and more entertaining than the major blockbuster. For me, only 'Zootopia' rivals 'Moana' in Disney's new era of incredible 3D computer animations.",Null,2,8,6 January 2017
Life of Pi," Visually stunning, but not by any means perfect
","Life of Pi is perhaps the most visually stunning film of all time. The incredible cinematography and CGI makes it a joy to watch, and it includes some of the most beautiful shots and frames that will ever grace your television screen. However, I think that while many were lost in the stunning physical beauty of this film, they refused to acknowledge a few minor flaws with other elements of the film. Pi faces challenges which only become challenges when the plot deems it necessary and interesting - such as thirst, which is a major issue in the film when he has can upon can of fresh water, and yet is barely considered when those cans are lost to a storm. Don't get me wrong - this film is spectacular in every sense of the word. But while the CGI effects and cinematography are the greatest that the film industry has ever seen, some elements of script and plot integrity have been slightly sacrificed. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful film with a fabulous exploration of human faith, and is suitable for the whole family. What more could we possibly ask for?",Null,0,0,22 February 2017
Lion," Very emotional and powerfully executed
","Lion was made exceptionally powerful by the fact that it is based on a true story - its masterful use of angles and sound were easy to see, and Nicole Kidman was wonderful in her role. The first act was rather disjointed and lacked the necessary emotion despite the dramatic events - but this was made up for by the epic second act and the heart-wrenching climax. I certainly wasn't as blown away by Lion as I thought I would be. But the movie was highly emotional, well-directed and brought something new to its genre. I left the cinema impressed, but not quite swept off my feet by it. Fantastic acting, fantastic directing - just a slightly disjointed and unevenly-paced plot which let the film down by a few marks.",Null,1,2,14 February 2017
Forrest Gump," Beautiful, and executed to a tee
","Forrest Gump is the defining motion picture of the latter half of the 20th century, in so many ways. It is a heart-warming, heartbreaking and beautifully constructed film that takes its audience on an emotional journey that will change hearts, minds and perspectives. The performance of Tom Hanks is utterly astounding. Hanks truly is what made this film a class above, and this is a sterling performance that stands out even in such an accomplished career. He brings heart, sincerity and empathy to a role that immediately captures the love and respect of the audience and leaves them in tears at the beauty and tragedy of Forrest's experiences.
The story itself is a genius concept executed to perfection. It is an exploration of the last fifty years of the 20th century through the eyes of a literal everyman. The innocent, unassuming perspective of Forrest Gump allows the audience to reflect on some of the highest and lowest points in America's history through a fresh set of eyes, seeing history from the point of view of someone without the prejudices and biases that come with educated thought and opinion. Forrest's mental handicap was necessary to create such a powerful everyman character, and yet Hanks manages to execute this without resorting to comical stupidity and dampening the credibility of the film's sincerity.
To emphasise the perfection of this film's writing even further, it is an exemplification of circular narrative, with incredible use of music and a variety of film types, camera angles and colour palettes to cover the roughly fifty-year period within its narrative reaches. Robert Zemeckis and his production team simply do everything right. This is a beautiful tale of love and hate, war and peace, comedy and tragedy that will be talked about for decades, and rightfully so. It is a testament to the writing of Winston Groom, and of course the directing of Zemeckis.
Hanks' performance is backed up by a supporting cast that executes their respective jobs perfectly, with special mention for Mykelti Williamson and Gary Sinise. Bubba and Lieutenant Dan are iconic characters that reflect tumultuous periods of American history, and their interactions with Forrest are beautifully executed to a tee.
Forrest Gump is unique in so many aspects. It is a wonderful exploration of the world through a fresh set of eyes, which is a concept so frequently attempted and so rarely achieved to such an impact as this. The world often needs to reflect on itself without its own prejudices, and there is no better film than Forrest Gump to show us all the state of affairs that we live in. This film should rightfully go down in history as one of the greats, and Hanks' performance should be hailed as perhaps the greatest leading performance in cinema. He captured our hearts from the moment that feather settled on his shoe and kept them neatly tucked in his suitcase until that feather drifted away yet again. Beautiful filmmaking at its finest.",9,1,1,26 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A theatrical miracle, nothing less
","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is the daunting first chapter in an action epic undertaking so daunting that it is almost a miracle that Peter Jackson managed to turn it into one of the greatest films of all time. Adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's extensive fantasy universe to the screen was a task that few could have succeeded at, let alone quite so thoroughly.
The Fellowship of the Ring in particular was left with the incredible challenge of orientating the audience to Tolkien's vast folklore - a task which Tolkien himself dedicated several chapters of the novels to. There were many characters, languages, places, myths and legends to be explained without losing the audience to pure exposition, and Jackson managed to do so with such elegance that, even in its significant runtime, the film is action-packed and engaging from end to end.
The casting of this trilogy should also go down in history as some of the best. Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Sean Bean and John Rhys-Davies are all perfectly cast and backed up by a supporting cast of such proven names as Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving.
The film itself is two and a half hours of eye-popping special effects, intense and perfectly-choreographed fight scenes and the wonder and tension of Jackson at his finest. As a reader of the novels myself, almost every character was exactly as I would have imagined, and the film became simply an exact visualisation of the first novel. One could almost forget that it was an adaptation and not the work of Tolkien himself.
While I have never been a fan of hard fantasy, and find world-building in films often time-consuming and tiresome, The Lord of the Rings found the perfect balance to build such an extensive world full of depth and folklore while still maintaining an action-packed pace and establishing itself as one of the greatest action-adventure trilogies in history.
All credit goes to Jackson for managing to transform Tolkien's often dense material into a film, and eventually a trilogy, that flows so beautifully from moment to moment. And credit in this instance to the wonderful performances of McKellen, Bean, Mortensen and Wood. Even for someone who strays from fantasy, The Lord of the Rings is a must-see and a personal favourite to return to from time to time.",8,0,0,25 April 2019
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Fantastic but really annoying
","As a massive fan of the X-Men films, I love this movie and hate it at the same time. While the special effects, character development and fantastic attachment to the other films that explains so much about characters such as Magneto and Professor Xavier, were all fantastic... I found myself pulling my hair out at the fact that this entire movie simply undoes what the other SIX films set out. So, essentially, you only need to watch this ONE film to know what has happened so far - none of the rest of it counts. Quicksilver was a highlight for me, but I wish that reviewers would stop attempting to compare the Days of Future Past version to the Age of Ultron version. It is safe to say that these two are COMPLETELY different interpretations of the character, both wonderful in their own vastly different ways.",Null,1,1,25 April 2015
City of God," It just does everything right
","City of God is almost a blend of content and medium - it is a literal snapshot of the story of a young wannabe photographer in the dangerous slums of Rio de Janeiro. It is a visually-striking roller coaster ride of a non-linear narrative that blends the best points of Pulp Fiction with the grit and visual style of Fight Club, the wonderful characterisation of Goodfellas and the overarching appeal of being based on a true story.
The circular nature of the narrative, whilst also being told in a non-linear fashion by its narrator, is quite satisfying and feels very neat and well-paced. Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund have managed to balance the unique plot structure in such an intricate way that every scene still makes sense, we still understand the intricacies of the relationships and scenarios, and we are still hanging on the narrator's every word until the satisfying conclusion.
The characterisation is this film's true masterpiece. There are deep complexities in every character that provide a layered picture of life in a favela surrounded by gang warfare. The good characters are deeply flawed, the bad characters have redeeming qualities, and quite often it's difficult to know exactly why we like or dislike a character. This is a film that endeavoured to portray just how complicated real life is, and created a bunch of wonderful, complex and fascinating characters in doing so.
Visually, there are lots of shots and moments of editing and cinematography that will quite simply make any film maestro nod their head in pure satisfaction. It's a neat blend of the world and the medium, with running themes of cameras flashing and guns firing. This is a rapid-fire film that comes at you with no hesitation, and it is satisfying and entertaining every step of the way.
If you're just becoming a bit of a film lover, City of God is a great induction to what it's all about. Quite simply, this is a film that seems to do everything exactly right, and it's a satisfying, emotional thing to watch unfold.",10,0,1,7 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A deeper, more human MCU film
","Avengers: Infinity War transforms the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A franchise renowned for its success on the superhero formula for so long finally comes to a beautiful fruition in this first of two Russo masterpieces.
In this epic installation, not only are the action sequences and the threat of the antagonist magnified, but the emotional stakes and exploration of the humanity of the much-loved characters increases tenfold. The Russos do a spectacular job of unravelling the human element of their heroes, pitting them against their greatest fears and revealing the drastic internal conflicts and their consequences.
Particularly for Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, this threat takes on a personal note that gives this particular blockbuster a very human, very emotional undercurrent.
Remarkably, with over sixty characters to work with, the story is not incredibly mispaced. There are certainly plot sequences and details that could have been dwelled on a little more, but the Russos achieve the unachievable - doing justice to all of our favourite characters within the space of just two and a half hours.
Josh Brolin's Thanos is perhaps the strongest element of this film. He has been, quite accurately, labelled 'the 21st century's Darth Vader'. This is a villain with true conviction to his cause, who breaks the stereotype of the simple one-dimensional 'universe dominator'. Thanos holds no prejudices. He believes that he is right and he refuses to stop at anything to achieve his goal. His motives are incredibly arguable, which makes both the physical and internal battles of the Avengers more intense and three-dimensional.
Brolin himself is threatening and full of the conviction of his character. His performance shines through the CGI to be one of the most fantastic in the history of the MCU.
Infinity War transformed the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe through its depth beyond the realms of the superhero franchise. It is a gritty, human chapter in the saga that brings to the fictional universe an unprecedented threat and truly meaningful emotional subplots.",8,0,0,28 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The weakest of the films, but that's not saying much
","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the weakest chapter of the trilogy - but that's not saying much. Peter Jackson's iconic adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's incredible fantasy universe is a milestone in cinematic history and indisputably one of the greatest film trilogies in history, and this opening statement is more of a testament to the quality of the other two films rather than a criticism of The Two Towers.
The Fellowship of the Ring can be praised for its introduction to a hefty folklore, narrowing the source material down to two and a half entertaining hours. The Return of the King, meanwhile, is a true epic, nearly three and a half hours of pure adrenaline, iconic battle sequences and incredible special effects.
The Two Towers attempts to be a middle ground between the two but finds itself stumbling upon the pitfalls of stretching a film's plot quite so thin. Still, it remains one of the most beautifully-crafted epics ever to grace Hollywood.
Along with the fantastic performances of Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and others, the cast is joined by the brilliant Andy Serkis, whose portrayal of Gollum is perfect to a tee. As a fan of the novels, I cannot imagine a better interpretation of the character for film than Serkis' brilliant portrayal.
The battle sequences are large-scale and awe-inspiring and the plot itself is engaging over the course of an abnormally lengthy runtime.
However, The Two Towers stumbles slightly whilst trying to jostle with the overarching plot requirements of the trilogy. Whilst trying to wedge itself between The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King, it sacrifices pacing and plot detail for a gratuitous induction to the battle scenes we should come to expect, and favours fan service and CGI over the natural flow of the narrative.
While some transitions felt clunky or rushed, however, there is no denying the quality of the finished product, and when considered as a chapter in the trilogy, The Two Towers more than satisfies. This was the film that originally captured my attention and made me a fan of The Lord of the Rings and while I consider it by far the weakest of the films, I by no means will ever discredit it in any way.
Peter Jackson, you sir have done something special with these adaptations, and if The Two Towers was the worst thing that came from your work on The Lord of the Rings, then you should be very proud of all you achieved.",8,0,0,26 April 2019
Schindler's List," Spielberg proves he has more than one trick up his sleeve
","Schindler's List is a unique work in the catalogue of Steven Spielberg that shows his flair and eye for the visual and artistic, while he may have been more renowned for his large-scale blockbuster story-telling. It is a profound and impactful true story that is captured with raw emotion and striking visual appeal.
Spielberg masterfully utilises the tools of his medium, and even the medium itself as a symbol, creating a graphic and atmospheric piece that is harrowing in the calm moments and horrifying to watch when it escalates. The gravity of the source material is certainly not lost on Spielberg, and the sincerity with which it is handled only adds to its power, as the power of the tragically true events are felt through this film.
Liam Neeson does a superb job, but credit should also be given to the supporting cast. Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley had particularly difficult roles to handle and did so with the mastery that we would expect of them. Further down the list, Embeth Davidtz was another particular standout.
Spielberg's use of black and white film is as impactful as it is famous, particularly when it comes to the rare use of colour as motif. While the colours in the candle flames and the young Jewish girl's coat are particularly muted, they are a stark contrast to the world around them, and powerful moments in film.
However, to go against the grain of history and provide one tiny grain of criticism, I felt that Spielberg was far too committed to visually depicting the crimes of Nazi Germany in a powerful and harrowing manner, and there are times during this film's lengthy runtime that the story itself is lost to the 'documentary depiction' of World War II. It felt at times that certain scenes were added purely for dramatic effect on the audience, and not for any real practical use to the story.
That being said, Schindler's List is amongst the most harrowing and powerful war films of all time, and its emotional impact is certainly lasting. It is a testament to Spielberg's mastery and love of his artform and his metacinematic style, which contrasts his earlier works of the likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws.",8,0,4,26 April 2019
Hidden Figures," Feel-good, empowering and thought-provoking
","Hidden Figures was, for a change, a bright, uplifting film that also managed to provoke thought and realisation of the need for change. Set in an inspiring 1960s scientific era, the film tackles serious issues of racial and sexual prejudice in an inspiring and uplifting manner. It was beautifully written, filled with motif and symbolism, and the performances of the three lead actresses were all astounding. The appearances of Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst were particularly surprising, and both played both the negative and positive facets of their characters to perfection. Both managed to be racist and unlikeable at their worst, and heart-warmingly kind at their best. The humour scattered throughout the film was appropriate, well-timed and didn't ruin the feel of the movie. My only criticism is that the women were perhaps a little too empowered right from the beginning. While I acknowledge that this is a true story, and should be told with accuracy to detail, the moments of empowerment later in the film lost their effect slightly due to the fact that I never saw the African-American women as 'weak' or 'oppressed' characters. Nonetheless, the film was empowering and dealt with the issue of prejudice very effectively.",Null,1,6,21 February 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A fantastic sequel to a fantastic film
","What a great way to continue the Marvel story. This is a humorous, chilling, emotional, action-packed film that deepens the plot of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultron is certainly a worthy and formidable foe, and Whedon does a fantastic job of crafting the theatrical version of the renowned comic-book villain. We are introduced to Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) in a dramatic manner, and all three are played remarkably by three very talented actors. It is almost with pleasure that Whedon creates tension within the Avengers team, strengthening our connection to both the existing Avengers and the ones we've just met. The audience are kept captivated throughout the whole film. Once again, Marvel has delivered a fantastic superhero movie to enjoy.",7,2,8,25 April 2015
The Dark Knight," A superhero great that benefits from cinematic genius
","The Dark Knight can be effectively labelled as indisputably the greatest superhero film of all time, with no exceptions. It is an incredible blend of the blockbuster appeal of the superhero subgenre, the grit and reality of the gangster genre and Christopher Nolan's own intricate and powerful storytelling style.But more on Nolan in a moment - it is important that we first address the performance of the film's primary villain, Heath Ledger as the Joker. There is a reason that Ledger's performance is idolised as the greatest comic book villain performance of all time, and it comes down to both Nolan's brilliance in adapting the Batman legend to a realistic modern setting, and Ledger's incredible knack for transformative acting.There is much throughout the Dark Knight trilogy that Nolan adapted thoroughly effectively to create a new kind of Batman story that will last throughout the ages. Comic book cartoonishness and campiness was replaced by a real, gritty exploration of what it is to be human, especially in this second instalment. And part of this symbolic exploration was the character of the Joker.Ledger's Joker actively rejects the 'rules' of comic book supervillains. His motivation is not power, money or influence, but rather a simple desire for chaos in order to reveal the true, human nature those who claim to hold righteousness in Gotham. It is through the lens of the Joker that Nolan explores a fascinating observation on humanity best described by Ledger's monologue to Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent - human society falls apart when things don't go according to plan - even when that plan is tragically flawed and corrupt.Thus, the Joker becomes not just another obstacle for Batman to overcome, but a true agent of chaos who reveals the worst in humanity, which is revealed in Eckhart's transformation to Two-Face. The supervillain, under Nolan's watch, takes on a more symbolic and important meaning than just another freak who opposes our hero.Ledger himself dives, tragically, headfirst into the role to explore depths of insanity and evil never quite experienced on film before. His last performance is one that truly reveals his talent and skill in the craft, and every appearance of the Joker brings a sinister energy to the film that results in him completely stealing the show.What makes Nolan's The Dark Knight an exception to the formulaic mediocrity of superhero films is its deeper meaning. Whatever Nolan touches turns to visual, meaningful and emotional gold, and this use of the superhero genre to explore the darkest aspects of humanity is truly the greatest that we have or ever will see.",10,0,0,24 April 2019
La La Land," Spellbinding, and totally unique
","Film buffs and critics always talk about a film 'bringing something new to its genre'. This is why we look down upon cliché and repetitive plots - we want something NEW and INTERESTING. And this movie, ladies and gentlemen, was EXACTLY what we are always on about. La La Land is utterly incredible. At times it seems almost experimental - the unique and unusual angles, plot devices and shots that the director had the audacity to take had me leaning forward in my seat, in complete disbelief at what I was seeing. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's chemistry was just INCREDIBLE, and the ending was truly heartbreaking. It was moments such as the tap dance number in the middle of the street, the shared flashback at the film's conclusion and the amazing floating dance scene that made this film what it was - different, something never seen before, and something utterly incredible. In my mind, it deserves every single one of the 14 nominations it has received. My only minuscule criticism is that perhaps the songs were not quite memorable enough. A few of them have already slipped my mind - but the better songs were, on the contrary, fantastic and beautiful. This film is just incredible. A story told from a unique and imaginative perspective, and one told with such passion and creativity that it stands out in my mind as perhaps one of the most filmically creative pieces of all time.",Null,1,7,6 February 2017
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino is dark comedy's king
","Pulp Fiction is all the evidence that any film buff needs to label Quentin Tarantino the king of dark comedy. While Tarantino's graphic style shines through in any project he undertakes, it is in this absurdist piece that blurs the boundaries of reality that his genius is truly most evident.Robert Kolker describes the 'absurd banality' of the dialogue in Pulp Fiction, which is an apt description given the almost Pinter-esque scenes that remain a prominent part of meme culture almost 30 years after the film's release. Tarantino's own performance in the 'dead nigger storage' scene, as well as iconic interchanges between Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) have remained some of the most recognisable dark comedy sketches in recent history.But it is not just in the absurdity of the dialogue and scenarios that Tarantino distorts reality in Pulp Fiction. The very film itself is told in a non-linear format, and the colourful aesthetic of the film itself generates a cartoon-like surrealism to the very existence of such a film.Exchanges are purposefully trivialised. From the accidental murder plotline, which lasts no less than an entire act, to Jules' obsession with biblical verses, the film takes on a silly, clownlike aura in the vein of many slapstick cartoons, while adhering to Tarantino's typically hyper-violent, extremely adult content.Pulp Fiction also finds a lot of its whimsical colour in its cavalcade of homages, from the dolly shot in the style of Stanley Kubrick to the 1950s restaurant with throwbacks to everyone from Marilyn Monroe to Buddy Holly. This film seems to exist purely as a shrine to the greatest filmmakers and influences on Hollywood cinema of all time, including obvious salutes to Martin Scorsese and Sergio Leone amongst others.The all-star cast really make the characters memorable, but it is important to remember what this film did for the careers of so many of the stars we consider permanent A-listers today. Jackson's career was cemented by his relationship with Tarantino, and Travolta's was revitalised by his Oscar nomination for his performance. Likewise, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis received a much-needed boost after fading from stardom in the 1990s, and the careers of Tim Roth and Eric Stoltz were catapulted to the stars.Jackson, however, is the standout. The iconic Samuel L. Jackson role that we have come to live is idealised in Jules, and this should be credited as the film that made Jackson the megastar that he has become.Overall, Pulp Fiction exists as indisputably the best dark comedy film ever made, and one of cinema's sparkling achievements. Its very existence is a shrine to Hollywood itself, and it stands as a unique, thoughtful piece of work in an industry that quite often lacks thus. Not even Tarantino will ever quite live up to the creativity, originality and genius behind Pulp Fiction ever again.",9,0,0,24 April 2019
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Only the finest
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the rare brilliant adaptation of a novel to film that truly captures the spirit of the original text. Milos Forman's version of Ken Kesey's novel catapulted its status to that of legend, becoming one of the most renowned films of all time.
The credit for the quality of this film rests entirely upon the brutal, open, honest and raw performances of the cast. Jack Nicholson shines as per usual, but the stunning supporting cast of Will Sampson, Sydney Lassick, Brad Dourif and Christopher Lloyd, amongst others, give us a beautiful emotional story arch and a real exploration of what sanity is.
The film explores what it means to be sane, and the effects of institutionalism, through these characters, who immediately defy the natural order and become the protagonists against the normal hierarchy of the doctors and nurses. We find ourselves rooting for the rebelling patients, leading us to question our treatment and stigma towards mental disability, and the dehumanisation of mental patients in institutions.
Put simply, this is an example of a Hollywood ensemble cast of some of the greatest of all time in some of the performances of their careers. Nicholson, Lloyd, Louise Fletcher and Danny DeVito are all at their stellar best, and this is a pleasure to watch at the worst of times, a truly magical experience at the best.
This is a film that will challenge anyone's perspective on what it means to be human, and what it means to be mentally sound. It's emotionally raw, it holds nothing back, and it is nothing but the best that Hollywood has to offer telling one of the most famous stories of the 20th century.
This is on the list that everyone must see before they die. Truly a once-in-a-generation quality of film.",10,1,1,29 April 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Maybe not 'The Greatest', but it's a triumph nonetheless
","The Shawshank Redemption is often referred to as the greatest film of all time. Frank Darabont's first of two Stephen King adaptations, it holds a unique place in pop culture and history.However, it is perhaps King's original story that should be regarded so highly, and not Darabont's adaptation. The film itself is magnificent, but certainly not as well-crafted as many would have you believe. There are some particular qualities that are to be admired and hailed as Hollywood greats, but The Shawshank Redemption is certainly not the greatest film ever made.Among these fantastic qualities is the performance of Morgan Freeman as Red, which will go down in history as among his finest.The strengths of the film are in its dialogue and storytelling, as well as the performances of Freeman and Tim Robbins, most of which should be credited to King and not Darabont's filmmaking.The structure of the film is nothing unique, and the shots are not experimental or special in any particular way. Darabont merely adapts the brilliance to the screen - he doesn't add any of his own artistry to the mix.When it comes to the strength of the filmmaking, The Shawshank Redemption is certainly a triumph, but nothing spectacular. Some crane shots and transitions, as well as the cinematography are excellent. However, when compared to the other 1994 classics in Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, it is clear that this film is very much plot- and character-driven.However, it is an overwhelmingly strong plot with wonderful characters. Robbins and Freeman have fantastic chemistry that provides some of the most famed and fantastic dialogue in cinematic history.The story itself is neatly-woven and tightly-knitted, to King's credit. While he is more renowned for his horror novels, The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps King's greatest work, and this adaptation benefits from the strength of the source material.The film itself is nothing particularly special, but the performances of Robbins and Freeman and King's brilliant novel make this one of the best adaptation films of all time.",9,0,0,24 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The chapter that sealed the trilogy's legendary status
","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King truly captures the best of what this trilogy is famous for. Without such an epic conclusion to the series, I honestly believe that The Lord of the Rings may not have been considered a successful adaptation at all. This is a true epic in every sense of the word.
This is a film with heart, emotion and incredible visual appeal. It combines the epic battle sequences of The Two Towers with the human element and character arcs of The Fellowship of the Ring. Our love for the friendship of Elijah Wood's Frodo and Sean Astin's Sam comes to fruition in this instalment, as does the camaraderie between Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli.
Not only that, but this is the film that truly cements The Lord of the Rings as one of the greatest accomplishments in cinema. This was the culmination of nine hours of the most epic and much-loved trilogy to date, and it lived up to the expectations in a big way.
There is not much more to say. The Return of the King takes what the previous two films did well and amplifies it several times over. It's bigger, it's more brutal, it's more emotional, it's more gripping and it's more inspiring. There's no question to me that if I only got to see one more film from this trilogy in my lifetime, it would be the third chapter without a second thought.
Praise goes to Peter Jackson, of course. The action epic is a style of film so rarely accomplished to such a degree as this. To captivate and thrill audiences over the course of three or more hours is a challenge, and Jackson achieved not just that, but made it one of the most widely beloved films in all of history.
The Return of the King is an absolute must-see, whether you're a fan of the Middle Earth folklore or not.",9,0,0,28 April 2019
The Matrix," The best of both cinematic worlds
","The Matrix is an achievement in visual cinematic history and also an accomplishment in terms of the layers and meaning of its script. While it is a fan-favourite action film on the surface, much like its titular plot element, this film is most beautiful when looked at carefully and examined on multiple levels.
The Wachowskis produced one of the most visually spectacular films of all time in The Matrix, combining mind-boggling special effects with gorgeous fight choreography, perfect colour palettes, magnificent cityscapes and eye-catching shots. There is no wonder that fans of action films immediately were enraptured by this film and its sequels.
However, most fascinating is its plot and cinematic stylings: simultaneously an analogy for human society, a philosophical exploration of the meaning of life, and an homage to Hollywood cinema. On the surface, the ramblings of characters on the idea of the Matrix may appear to be just that. But the existentialism of this storyline is thoroughly thought-out and brilliantly executed.
There are a variety of shots that testify the Wachowski's love for their medium. The one that caught my eye in particular was the Western-style introduction to Neo's final battle with Agent Smith. The Wachowski's love affair with cinema shines through in their greatest creation.
Somehow, the Wachowskis have cracked an uncrackable formula. They have simultaneously created a film that visually appeals to the audience seeking the thrills and explosions of action blockbusters, whilst also taking a philosophical dive into the meaning of human life and our existence in this universe.
The Matrix is riveting, fascinating and entertaining for every film fan from the light viewer to those looking for a more introspective and meaningful form of entertainment.",9,0,0,30 April 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Love, love, love it!
","It may sound 'out there', but I think this is in contention for the best spy movie of all time. While the original James Bond films certainly take that title, the modern ones have become a disappointment to the sub-genre, and this humorous film took me back to seeing the originals. It had everything that made them classics, and more. Along with hilarious side-splitting comedy, it added a neat plot twist, some fantastic action sequences and remarkable special effects. Samuel L. Jackson was the perfect villain, and I would commend the younger actors for a performance that will hopefully put them into the limelight for some larger appearances. Perhaps my only criticism is the lack of development in the romantic interests that were clearly evident in the film. The movie teases and taunts, hinting at a relationship which never comes to fruition. But I take no shame in saying that I left the cinema with tears in my eyes, giggling at the perfection of this film.",Null,3,10,25 April 2015
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Classic British comedy
","This is the pinnacle of Monty Python's creations. Essentially a montage of the best that British comedy has to offer, this film is hysterical, satirical and masterful. From the hilarious Knights of Ni to the crazy antics of the Black Knight, this film contains so many of the fabulous Monty Python moments that we all love and treasure, and is one of the greatest comedy movies ever made. There is little that can be criticised. Every seeming flaw only works to service the satire and comedy of the film, and every supposed hiccup almost seems deliberate, adding to the fantastic nature of this hilarious film. Of all the movies I've seen, this is the one that I will always probably quote the most - from African and European swallows to the three questions to cross the Bridge of Death, it provides such moments of both verbal and physical comedy that have, and will continue to go down in history as comedy at its very finest.",Null,1,4,22 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A landmark in the history of Hollywood cinema
","Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back marks the beginning of a new age of cinema. It is the sequel and instalment in the Star Wars franchise that revolutionised the way Hollywood perceived the stories it envisioned and changed the movie industry in ways both positive and negative. The film itself is a magnificent second chapter in the greatest blockbuster trilogy of all time, arguably overshadowing its predecessor and effectively wrapping its audiences up in the characters, folklore and plot that the Star Wars trilogy had created.In producing the greatest blockbuster sequel of all time, however, Irvin Kershner unintentionally changed the face of Hollywood production forever, giving birth to both brand-new ways of telling more layered stories through cinema, such as today's Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the trend of money-grabbing through endless remakes and sequels. Film properties became profitable assets, rather than a one-off form of art.Today, every franchise worth its salt, and even some of the ones which aren't, spawns at least one sequel. But in 1980, Kershner's follow-up to 1977's A New Hope was a shiny new concept that drew record box office crowds through the sheer innovation of the idea of a second chapter in the Star Wars story. But, while the crowds it drew are perhaps credited to the novelty of the idea, Kershner should be credited as well. The Empire Strikes Back is an exemplified exception to the rule of sequels always losing the artistic integrity of the original concept.The dialogue is as classic as ever, the performances from Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams and James Earl Jones among others are superb, and Kershner's space opera is masterfully constructed with beautiful practical effects and a tightly-knit concept. In all of the above aspects, The Empire Strikes Back even arguably outshines its predecessor.Furthermore, The Empire Strikes Back utilised its existence as the middle chapter in a larger story to perfection, allowing itself to present a twist on the expected narrative in which the antagonists triumph. We are left with our heroes scattered, the Rebellion all but crushed, and the Empire with the upper hand. While A New Hope and Return of the Jedi remain classics, The Empire Strikes Back was a defiance of the cliched narrative trend and a revolutionary piece of cinema in more ways than one.Whether you are a Star Wars fan or not, it is beyond debate that The Empire Strikes Back changed the face of Hollywood cinema forever and is indisputably one of the greatest film sequels and blockbusters of all time. A film cannot spawn as many iconic quotes as this one and still not be considered a true work of cinematic genius and a piece of art in itself.",9,0,0,24 April 2019
Braveheart," I have certain feelings towards Mel Gibson, but all credit to him
","Braveheart is a work of passion and an inspiring historical picture that encapsulates the spirit of the legend of William Wallace, if not quite as much the accurate legend itself. This is Mel Gibson's finest work and his dedication and love of the project shine through in his raw and emotional directing style and leading performance.
There are times that Braveheart feels a little bit self-indulgent from Gibson's perspective. The film gives birth to rousing monologues and inspirational battle sequences that revolve entirely around Gibson's impassioned performance as Wallace, and while it is undeniably a masterpiece of a film, there is certainly a reflection of the Australian's high opinion of himself in this project.
Nonetheless, his performance certainly does make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck, and the gritty, bloody style of this film makes it a historical epic worth watching. It is confronting, heart-breaking, heart-warming and uplifting in many ways throughout its three-hour runtime.
The score by James Horner is superb, and Gibson's use of the orchestral soundtrack to further amplify the emotional impact of this story is legendary. The addition of bagpipes to the typical action-adventure score is a neat touch that is as effective as it is symbolic.
But as many times as I watch this film and love it to bits, I cannot help but feel that the combination of certain historical inaccuracies and Gibson's hogging of the spotlight slightly undermine the authenticity and genuineness of the film. This is only a tiny seed of doubt that is quenched by my love of the dialogue, action sequences and music, but it is there, and I do wish that another performance had risen to the fore to make it feel slightly less self-promoting.
However, a self-promotion or not, it is a wonderful film, and we can only give credit to Gibson for one of the greatest performances and one of the greatest historical films of the 20th century.",8,1,4,30 April 2019
Back to the Future," A great film for light viewing, a blockbuster classic
","Back to the Future is an example of some of the most thoroughly-planned filmmaking in history. It is an often-expressed sentiment that in film and theatre, everything that happens should have significance, and this trilogy, and particularly the first chapter, are an example of exactly how thoroughly a good director can achieve this.
Robert Zemeckis works extremely hard to craft a film with such symmetry, motif in both visuals and dialogue, and general tight-knit cleverness, that it rightfully goes down in history as a favourite of film fans the world over.
The zany characters, particularly the performances of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, are superb. Along with the parallels of dialogue and props, the characterisations of each of the recurrent leads are vital to the time travel plot, and they are achieved to perfection.
As is always the case with such philosophically complex issues as time travel, there are some gaping plot issues, however anyone willing to enjoy a film for what it is can overlook these with ease and disregard them as simple oversights in an issue that even the brightest theoretical scientists struggle to grasp properly.
The soundtrack to this film is another stand-out, with catchy music both in the orchestral score and the contributions of Huey Lewis and the News and John Berry that really adds to the overall feel of the film. The entire trilogy, but particularly the first chapter is fun, bright, engaging and enjoyable for all ages, and generally a wonderfully-crafted action-adventure created with the enjoyment of the audience at heart.
Back to the Future goes down in history as one of the blockbuster greats, and for good reason. This is a fantastic film for light viewing that can be enjoyed at any time and in any place. It's a definite favourite to view on a rainy day when I'm not in the mood to do an awful lot of thinking in my film viewing.",8,0,0,29 April 2019
