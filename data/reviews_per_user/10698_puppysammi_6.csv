Your Name.," Captivating storyline
","One of the best Japanese animation I've watched. I love it when the story unfolds in a way that I didn't expect. I was captivated all the way through. There might be some details here and there that might not make the most sense, but hey, it's a fantasy so let's just roll with it.",10,1,1,10 April 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," The 2nd one is better
","A bit on the purposefully cheesy side. Lays the groundwork for the next movie, which I like much more than this.",6,2,4,11 April 2020
The Butterfly Effect," Trippy
","I enjoy movies that explore the concept of time travel and the consequences that comes with changing the past/future. I personally think the main character exercised too little control over his behavior when he goes back in time - his over the top behavior is often unnecessary. But the movie itself is still entertaining. If you enjoy this movie, you might also enjoy The Time Traveler's Wife and Interstellar.",7,0,0,3 April 2020
Limitless," Entertaining
",The main character presents as a nice little escape of reality into a world of limitless opportunities. Entertaining.,8,1,1,3 April 2020
Joker," Great storyline
","The movie did a great job portraying the creation of the Joker in a relatable, and realistic way. It also helps highlight the importance of mental health and awareness.",9,2,2,3 April 2020
Incredibles 2," Some expected, some unexpected
",This one was an easy watch - some parts of the storyline was pretty predictable but then something a bit more unconventional would come into play. Nice pass time.,7,2,2,3 April 2020
