The King's Speech," I was alive at the time celebrated in this movie, so I take up the challenge to speak of that far-off time.
","I was eleven when WWII was declared, and I remember vividly the King's speeches both on that occasion and at the earlier Wimbledon event. My husband, whom I was to meet ten years later, has exactly the same memories of gathering with our respective families to listen to the old radio, of holding our breaths and urging him on. 'You can do it, Bertie!'. I wept with my mother as we shared the king's struggle, and marvelled at his determination to overcome his difficulties. Of all the kings of Britain, this one was for me the only one whose crown proved to be deserved--for his courage, his integrity, and his caring for both his own family and the people in the street. This movie has surpassed any I have ever seen, and I delight in the love of the three men--bonded brothers--who made it.",10,0,1,2 March 2011
