Scarface," Yuck!!!
","Al has made two great movies in GF 1&2 and two of the worst in Dog Day Afternoon and Scarface. The lines are written like it was for a high school play, the acting is like a soap opera. The worst is Al, his accent is one of the worst ever in movies. The movie is stupid, makes no sense and should be used as a plan for a bad B movie. 1 out of 5 stars I have seen worse but not often.",6,2,5,29 September 2003
Alien 3," yucky
","After how good the first and second movies were I was looking for a great ending to the Ripley saga, BUT NOOOOOOOOO Whoever made Alien 3 must not have ever seen the first two, Alien 3 made no sense it had very little story and some of the worst acting ever. I cant bring myself to see Alien 4 because of how bad 3 was.",4,391,409,18 June 2000
Ghost," Wonderful story of fantasy and love mixed with comedy
","Ghost was a movie that nobody wanted, the studio wanted two big names for the lead but no stars like the script, they picked two slightly unknown actors (Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze), the script was rewritten, the studio did not like the finished movie and put it on the shelf to collect dust, the studio brought in a different head of production and he discovered Ghost, as did we all. Ghost is lighting in a bottle, perfect acting jobs by three people in Hollywood that get no respect, (Moore, Swayze, and Whoopi Goldberg. A wonderful story of fantasy and love mixed with comedy. The music was wonderful and fit the movie perfect. Ghost would not have been as good without the ending, it will make you cry and think about the afterlife. 8 out of 10",8,4,5,7 July 2003
Casablanca," one of the ten best movies of all time
","A true great movie that works on all levels, it is a war story with lots of drama, a love story with suspense, a spy story with lots of intrigue, The casting and the writing are perfect. Casablanca let you wonder will Ilsa leave her husband or not, it lets you wonder if Rick have the letters and what he will do with them. No matter how many times you what Casablanca if it always a wonder.'You played it for her, you can play it for me. Play it!'. Ilsa says 'Play it, Sam. Play `As Time Goes By''.",10,1,1,2 October 2001
12 Monkeys," Bruce makes another bad choice
","Bruce Willis has proved when he wants to he can really act, but between those times he picks crap like this, Twelve Monkeys along with Fifth Element is Bruce at his worst, the question I have is it Bruce or does he just pick bad material? Twelve Monkeys has a rehashed script that was taken from other movies including Andromeda Strain (which is a far superior movie) Logans run, one flew over the cuckoo's nest and a little know movie called Millennium from 1989, twelve monkeys take all of those movies and many more and mashes them together to make one dark long confusing boring mess that makes you shake your head at the end. The one bright spot is Brad Pitt who plays a crazy genius the rest of the cast is wasted. 4 out of 10 it's not the worst movie I have ever seen but it is far from the best",Null,2,4,18 May 2002
L.A. Confidential," Long Dull and confusing
","L.A. Confidential is one long dull confusing movie with small sparks that quickly fade and burn out, even a stellar cast including Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe cant get past the convoluted script that makes so many twists and turns you will get a headache, the acting is good except for one person and that one person is Kim Basinger who for some unknown reason was given an oscar, I say given because her performance in this movie was not only terrible but it was one of the worst I have ever seen. If you like good movies try something else, if you like watching a movie for three hours that bores you to tears and makes you say thanks god that is over try this. 3 out of 10 stars",3,10,28,10 May 2002
Elf," As Magic as Christmas
","Elf is a magic movie for the whole family, no cursing, no sex, no nudity, but a lot of fun. Will Ferrell is an Elf named Buddy that is human but has the spirit of Christmas all year long. The cast is great except for James Cann who is miscast as Buddies father. Elf takes it's place alongside other magic Christmas movies like Big, White Christmas and it's a wonderful life. 9 out of 10 stars.",Null,0,1,22 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I guess George Lucas dosent need a good script anymore
","Attack of the clones is 2 hours of special effects which are fantastic and nothing more, the story is nothing more than fill to lead to the next effect, the acting is wooden the dialog is terrible. The first two movies from Lucas in this current trio makes us realize how all around great movies star wars, the empire strikes back and revenge of the jedi were. I guess George knows he can make money with just special effects and this is what we are gonna get. 7 out of 10",Null,0,0,1 June 2002
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump is a winner
","Forrest Gump is a kind honest sweet movie with edges of real life sadness. Forrest takes us back to old days of movies when every other word did not have to be cursing,Forrest is a simple man making his way through an unsimple life,the entire cast was brilliant. A wonderful movie and well deserved an oscar. We will never see the likes of this kind of movie again. 9 out of 10",8,1,2,31 July 2001
The Godfather: Part II," The best of the two movies
",One of  the three best movie ever made along with Godfather 1 and apocalypse now. Gf two returns to the family and tells the history of how the godfather came to power. The best scene of the movie is when a young Vito returns to Italy and takes revenge on the man that killed his family. A 10 out of ten just like the first movie.,10,1,1,6 September 2000
The Matrix Revolutions," The second best of the trio
","Revolutions is the second best of the three movie for a few reasons, the makers went back to what made the first movie great great, human feelings, they second thing is they kept Reeves (who is terrible) off the screen most of the movie till the end. Revolutions is light years ahead of the second movie and all three kick the dog out of the current star wars movies. 9 out of 10",9,3,6,6 November 2003
Cast Away," 2 movies 2 movies 2 movies in 1
","Cast away is two movies in one,the first half is all about time,the second half is about time has no meaning and Tom Hanks plays both half great. This movie is not for the average movie fan,if you like bombs sex and violence this is not the movie for you,if you love movies for the story and the games his mind plays on him while on the island you will love Cast away,this is also the only movie you will ever see that makes you care about a volleyball and cry when he floats away. all in all a wonderful Hanks movie but not nearly his best. 8 out of 10",9,0,0,7 August 2001
The Alamo," Boring, Tedious and full of Bull
","I am a fourth generation Texan, I am proud of my state and my heritage, that been said, I am ashamed of the movie the Alamo, I am ashamed of the director, John Lee Hancock a Texan, turning David Crockett into a coward, I am ashamed of the director for turning the back injury Jim Bowie had at the Alamo into him being a sick drunk. I am ashamed of the movie studio for forcing this crap on Ron Howard and Russell Crowe until they quit the movie. The worst tripe of the movie was the idea that David Crockett was not killed at the Alamo, there he stood at the end of the movie on the wall, what a crock of crap, the director is telling you that after fighting the Indians, the French and the English, Crockett was now a coward, who begged for his life. The Alamo along with it's many historical inaccuracies is a slow moving, tedious, boring piece of bull that should never been made. Ron Howard did research for two years to make the real story of the Alamo, when the studio wanted to add a bunch of lies in to the movie; Howard quit, as he should have. The entire cast was boring and lifeless. 2 out of 10",Null,1,5,12 November 2004
Apocalypse Now," The best movie ever
","I was thinking about which was my favorite movie of all time and it was between the Godfather 1&2 and Apocalypse now, All three movies are great from start to finish but I think Apocalypse now is my favorite because the darkness of the movie matches the darkness of  Willards mind. The absurdity and the horror of war in one of the best movies ever made. Never get out of the boat real goddam right.",10,0,0,9 June 2000
Independence Day," A great movie
","A wonderful wonderful movie, Not long like 2001 but filled with action and real people. The casting was perfect,making will Smith the lead instead of a white was great.There are small moments in this movie that are special,like when they discover area 51 is real and there is a real alien spacecraft. As far as the jerks putting down Americans and this American movie 75% of all movies are made with Americans in mind because thats where the money is,also when was the last time Ireland or Spain had a movie make 200 million dollars (answer NEVER), I am not putting down other countries but the American bashing of the jerks posting from Ireland and Spain make me sick.",8,0,2,15 June 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A step behind the first
","Jurassic Park had more people and less dinosaurs and was great, lost world had less people and more dinosaurs and was also great, the terror level in lost world was just as great as the first movie. Someone made a comment that it was impossible for a T-rex to push the trailor over the cliff, I think two 8 ton T-rex's could push that trailor anywhere they wanted. Lost world is an 8 out of 10",8,1,2,15 July 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," story thin as a razor's edge
","As an action movie this is one of the best ever,the fight scenes were set up wonderfuly. As a story it falls flat,the story makes no sense,changes direction with no explanation and only is there to set up the fights. I see now why it did not win best picture. 10 for the fight scenes 2 for the story makes an 8",Null,0,0,7 August 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Great but not as the first
","MI2 is great but not as great as the first, no chemistry between Tom and the girl, pacing problems also. The John Woo action was great as always but we needed more of that. 7 out of 10",8,1,2,8 January 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," Great but long and dated
","Arthur C. Clarke said 'If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.' And 2001 did just that, a wonderful special movie that was way a head of its time in story, music and special effects. Stanley Kubrick had a bad habit of making long movies that meandered and needed to be cut some and 2001 was one of those movies, as a child when I saw this movie the great scenes were great but the boring scenes were very very boring and now as an adult I have not changed that thought. This movie was great for it's time but now coming up on 2001 it is badly dated",7,1,5,20 October 2000
Men in Black," Average very average
","A lot of my friends kept telling me how great MIB was so my wife and I took our daughter and some of her friends to see it, when the movie was over as we were walking to our car our daughter said it was ok wasn't it ? we all nodded in agreement, it's not that MIB was bad it was just very very average, the story was long and drawn out with boring parts, on the other hand the few good parts were very good, Will Smith's dialog was snappy but Tommy Lee Jones was very dull. 6 out of 10 and lets hope the second one is better.",6,1,2,12 January 2002
Mission: Impossible," A smart underrated movie
","Mission impossible is a smart yet vastly underrated movie, a good story with lots of action and the fact of no less than 7 great actors in the cast makes it even better. M I had a lot to live up to because of the greatness of the t.v. show  and it does not let us down. To bad the sequel was not as good as the first. 7 out of 10",8,0,2,8 April 2002
The Last Samurai," WOW! WHAT A MOVIE
","Tom Cruise movies are 50-50 with me, he has made some good ones and some stinkers, I waited to see Last Samurai and now I wished I had seen it in the theater. Last Samurai is a great movie in the vein of Braveheart and Dances with Wolves. Cruise may have his best performance ever and deserved at least a nomination for an Oscar. The real star of Last Samurai is Ken Watanabe, the noble Samurai Lord, his performance is one of greatness, and he is fierce and brave, gruff and kind, fighting to save his way of life. Last Samurai is one of the best 20 movies ever made. 9 out of 10",Null,1,2,18 June 2004
Titanic," One of the best 20 movies of all time
","I kept putting off seeing this movie with my wife because I labeled it a chick movie,I was so very wrong, Titanic has well written characters and a story even though we knew the ending keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire three hours. There really was a Rose on the Titanic. The critics of this movie only have to look at the fact that is made almost 2 billion dollars world wide when no movie have ever made more than 900 million,this Titanic amount of cannot be just from teenage girls. Titanic is as close to a perfect movie as has ever been made. I give it a 10 and put it in my top 20 with the likes of the Godfather and jaws.",10,3,6,20 June 2001
The Godfather: Part III," Stop while he was ahead
","Francis Ford Coppola turned Godfather 1&2 into two of the best movies ever to bad he dident put as much effort into 3. I did not believe for one single second that after all those years of being a ruthless killer Mike has turned into a kitty cat, I did not believe for one second that after being abused by Mike that his wife would forgive him so fast. The worst part was the acting of Francis Ford Coppola's daughter , I guess her father never relized she coudent act till the movie bombed at the box office. Now we know why Robert De Niro and Robert Robert Duvall refused to be in 3. 5 out of 10",Null,4,6,24 July 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," Slam Bam Action but stupid acting
","I love the way the Matrix had a buddist sense of it's self, Reloaded is just a car crash action movie, but what action, some of the stunts take your breath away. Now the bad news, the brothers took away some of the magic of the first movie by giving KR 90% of the screen time, you will be bored when Neo has his fourth fight scene before the movie is half over. You will wonder why they gave such a talented cast the brush off over a less talented KR. The magic of the Matrix is the entire cast, reloaded lost that. This Movie runs 2 1/2 hours but 1 hour of it could have been cut. 10 out of 10 for stunts 1 out of 10 for story Overall I give it an 8 out of 10",9,0,0,15 May 2003
The Green Mile," The good And The horror
","I watched this movie as a person that is totally pro death penalty, I believe if a person takes a life they should forfeit their own life in the same way they took life. The green Mile made me think of how many innocent people have been put to death, now I believe all persons on death row should have DNA tests to prove their guilt. Green Mile is a thought provoking powerful film with pieces of humor mixed in with horror and injustice, Michael Clarke Duncan was wonderful and should have won the Oscar as best supporting actor, his child like innocence was my favorite part of the movie. Tom Hanks continues to cement his place as this centuries best actor with Green Mile. The green Mile is a must see for people with a strong stomach because of some of the electric chair scenes. I read somewhere that the ending of the movie was changed from the book and the book is better so I will check it out. 9 out of 10 because I haven't read the book",9,0,1,8 October 2000
Jaws," The first and still the best
","Jaws was and is still the most terrifying movie of all time, Leaving the shark hidden for most of the movie was a piece of genius, Jaws scares people because we are more afraid of what we cant see, the mostly lack of blood is replaced by a leg falling leg hitting the bottom of a lagoon, a head falling through a hole in the boat. The funny thing is that when Jaws came out and people were leaving the beach by the millions scientist's told us that a large shark like that would never come close to a public beach a 28 foot great white was caught 150 miles off the coast of long island. Is it safe to go back into the water after 25 years? NO WAY MAN",10,2,4,15 July 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," Quiet evil
","Silence of the lambs is one of the scariest movies of all time because of the way Anthony Hopkins portrays Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter, people think killers look like say Charles Manson but in silence Dr Lecter is an intelligent cunning physiatrist bent on playing games like a spider plays with a fly, Mr Hopkins quiet chilling portrayal of the mad doctor is perfect, Jodie Foster as the fresh faced FBI Agent Clarice Starling is the perfect plaything for the doctor, Ted Levine playing Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb is an actor I have never heard of before this movie but I can never see him in anything with out thinking of his role in silence. The writing was perfect, the acting was first rate, the directing of this movie keeps you wondering what will happen next and when it comes you want more. there are very few perfect movies and this is one of them. 10 out of 10",10,1,1,24 August 2001
Any Given Sunday," The best football movie ever made
","Any given sunday is by far the best football movie ever made,the action was up close terrific,the acting was great showing what football is really like. The only thing wrong with the movie is the names and uniforms of the teams (yuck)the Dallas uniforms were horrible. A great movie 8 out of 10",8,0,0,18 March 2001
Blade Runner," Great movie
","I saw this movie when it can out and loved it,the movie has this dark noir feel. Harrison Ford's understated performance was perfect. A great Sci-Fi movie. I have waited for the 19 years for a sequal. Also a kick ass video game",7,2,4,14 June 2001
Bull Durham," The best Baseball Movie Ever made
","My father being an ex minor league player and I went to see Bull Durham as soon as it came out, for the next week we talked about the movie and the people in the movie, baseball groupies are called baseball Annie's hence the name Annie Savoy for Susan Sarandon's character, the long rides on an old bus, the low pay, the teams filled with hot shots on the way up and career minor leaguers on the way down. Two ladies that my father went to church with complained to him how crude and vulgar the movie was, dad told them they toned it down for the movie if they had put the really raunchy baseball stories in the movie it would have gotten and x rating. Bull Durham captures the essence of minor league baseball with all the lows and few highs, the baseball scenes are great, the only flaw was Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh  going from A ball which is rookie league jumping right to the major leagues it just does not happen that way, players even great players take a year or more to get a call up.",8,0,3,9 October 2000
The Sixth Sense," Best Horror movie
","Most horror movies try to scare you with heads and hands being chopped off, after that has been done 60 or 70 times it becomes stale and boring, the Sixth Sense brings a new and fresh twist, this is by far one of the two or three scariest movies ever made. As a person who has had dreams about death that came true and has had my grandmother come and visit me after her death I related to this movie 100%. The Sixth Sense gives you clues about Bruce Willis during the movie but you are to busy centering on the boy to pay attention. To all the people that did not like Sixth Sense why do you even go to the movie if you cant be happy, I am so tired of people bashing good movies, our world today is so based on being negative.",10,0,0,4 October 2000
The Matrix," The best action movie ever made
","I was doubtful of another science fiction movie staring Keanu Reeves, his efforts have ranged from bad to yuck!!! So I did not see this movie in the theatre but later a friend of mine with a theatre system put it is and I was blown away, the Matrix is the best action movie ever, not only is the action kick ass but the Matrix makes you think about the world around you. The Matrix also have two things in it that very few Hollywood movies ever have a strong black lead and a strong female lead that is not weak and helpless. This movie is a classic and for those of you that don't like it you are going to have to put up with a matrix 2 and 3 so get ready for more action. Lets hope the brothers make them as good as the first.",9,0,0,29 July 2000
The Matrix," The best Scifi of all time
","Lets's understand some things about the Matrix, it has ground breaking special affects, it has a buddist sense of itself and a great story. This makes it the best scifi movie movie of all time. It belongs in the same breath with Star Wars.Now to those people that dont like Matrix. What do you hate about a movie that has a great story, an understated Keanu Reeves and great special affects? to those people that hate the Matrix, keeping watching movies like Legally Blond and leave the great scifi movie to us.",9,0,1,18 April 2003
Gladiator," Fight scenes ok talking scenes horrible
","Gladiator was two movies in one,the wonderful action movie that had the best fights scenes in movie history,the second part was the boring boring slow slow slow talking part,1 hour of this three hour movie could had been cut out. A great movie but not worth a oscar for best picture. 8 out of 10",8,0,0,25 March 2001
Jurassic Park," The first and still the best
","Jurassic park was not just first movie of the series but the best,the best action,the best story.Jurassic park has a sense of wonderment and excitement a lot of special effects movies dont have. Jurassic park takes the viewer on a roller coster ride and hardly ever lets you rest,the moments of humor add to the story. Welcome to Jurassic park.",9,4,5,30 December 2001
The Godfather," One of the three best movies ever made
","The Godfather is one of the two or three best movies ever made, A skillfully crafted movie that looks into the heart of a mob family. Micheal is a war hero wanting to stay out of the family business untill his father is shot, After that all bets are off, Al Pacino gives a calm yet chilling preformance as Mike. Well written the movie zips along with no dull parts. 10 out of 10",10,0,1,8 July 2000
