Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Soft plot, but still good.
","I would suggest this movie to anyone. It's a good movie even a non sci-fi fan would enjoy. It had excellent graphics; and the racing scene was spectacular. I don't want to give anything away, but I must say the plot was a little soft. The young actor who played Skywalker showed little emotion in his lines, and had lines that were cheesy. For example, 'This is tense!'",7,0,0,21 May 1999
The Notebook," What love is really all about
","Well, I just saw the sneak preview and I must say that this was/is one excellent film. Back to the roots of movie making, without all the hype and special effects, we see real characters, thus real people. I was deeply moved by this picture because the film makers showed the viewer real life in all its form regarding love, how it can never be conquered or forgotten - it truly stands the test of time. I gave this movie an eight because I thought the sex/romance scenes didn't really fit the overall picture (too long; you'll see what I mean if you see this film). James Garner is the key character in this film. If you can't relate to him, you can't relate to the movie... means you've never loved someone... On the technical side of things, the cinematography was absolutely beautiful, directing was average, and editing was flawless.",8,0,0,12 June 2004
