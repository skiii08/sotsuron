Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Doesn't anybody get it?
","I've read close to a hundred comments on this movie, about the bad acting, disappointments due to high expectations, etc. etc. etc. It's clear that 99% of you who have seen the Star Wars series don't get it at all.First and foremost, the acting in The Phantom Menace is not wooden! Try to remember: most of the characters are politicians. Even Queen Abudala is a politician, even though she's not very good at it. The chief exceptions are Jin and Kenobi, and Skywalker, each of whom turn in credible performances. The two Jedi act the way they do because they've been taught practically from birth to be passive, that the Force governs their destiny. This they show quite effectively. As for Skywalker, his character clearly is that of a little boy, overcompensating for his status as a slave by being boastful.Second, and equally important, Star Wars is basically a Saturday afternoon serial; no more, no less. If you expect more out of these films, you will be disappointed; don't even bother to watch. But for those of us who can completely suspend disbelief (or perhaps just smirk slightly at the more obvious violations of physics) and watch these classics with the eye of a child, Lucas has framed in excess of eight hours of pure fun, and counting. Bless him for that.",8,0,0,8 June 1999
Independence Day," On what level does this movie not offend?
","Some parts can be glossed over. For instance, the parts that look like a sketch based on Henny Youngman bits (a Jew and a gay go into a bar...), are Vader and Solo any less cliché? The parts that strain believable? Metachlorians anyone? Fantasy-based sci-fi, which has the feel of being directed by a German (haven't confirmed this) who pulls his cliché cards the way Capra pulls happy endings out of the tears.But -- from now on the whole world will celebrate July 4th as Independence Day? It's about bloody time the Americans took the lead while the Earth gets blown to bits? Yay the Americans saved the day? Insulting to the world, and embarrassing to any American with a brain. Needless to say, the flag-waving survivalist Winnebago across the desert crowd wouldn't be embarrassed by this movie.I often wonder if more Americans have been a broad (transgender) than have been abroad, but regardless I live in a huge multicultural city where you never hear American without bloody in front of it. The world respects you about as much as you deserve it. You don't have to get over yourselves, that's your right, but this movie is a glaring example of why you're on the road to irrelevance.",3,5,8,25 May 2008
The Pianist," Belongs in the horror genre
","People laugh at horror flicks, and look for the happy ending in dramas. The Pianist is the latest in the modern onslaughts on the senses, ala Blackhawk Down and Saving Private Ryan.In the context of Schindler's list, Shoah, and The Sorrow and the Pity, this film was left with nothing original to say. Therefore it is Polanskis self-indulgance alone that causes this film to be made. Labor of love notwithstanding, the audience is not enriched in having seen it, but is rather shell-shocked -- AGAIN. Enough is enough. Stop the narratives on the horrors of war. People DO get it, and no, it's not going to stop the next great atrocity or war, no matter how much you bludgeon people with your ideology. 200,000 Iraqis killed by Hussein, 300,000 more killed by the USA in the two wars. Hundreds of thousands murdered in Yugoslavia breakup. Polanski, how about some art in your next project?",7,0,1,18 April 2003
Rudy," Second best is first loser
","This is a movie about the good ol' college try, taking one for the team, and about 74 more cliches about how people with limited talent and resources ought to be given the chance to grab for the brass ring.Because this was an American film, Rudy must suit up for a game, and in the game he must actually play, and actually playing he must do something spectacular. Sorry folks, that was charity time, and he should have been at the game in the stands with his parents. It's no victory when 70,000 people feel sorry for you and throw you a crumb.",Null,4,11,25 May 1999
Titanic," Great movie, despite minor flaws
","Everyone's seen this movie, so I'll omit any introduction and head straight to specific comments. I thought the plot twist of hand-cuffing Jack below deck of the sinking ship and managing to free him and still yet managing to make it back up despite the freezing water was way too much. Also, the Gallagher character and his stooge were too predictable in their badness. Nevertheless, Titanic delivers a visual and conceptual whallop that lingers on in the memory and imagination.",9,1,2,1 December 1998
