Requiem for a Dream," Honest, Brutal, Confronting, Heartbreaking
","A warning to all who have not yet seen this film - this is not a feel good movie. If you like walking away from films feeling good about yourself and that all is right with the world, I'd advise you to give this movie a miss. But for everyone who appreciates a more honest and real approach in film making, I can't emphasise enough how much you should see this film!!!!!Darren Aronofsky's four lead characters are played brilliantly by Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans. Aronofsky and the actors have captured their individual spiral into self destruction perfectly. As the movie progresses, we gain insight into their hopes and dreams, their weaknesses and flaws, and their insecurities. It is an astonishing moment when you realise that you understand Burstyn's Sarah. Her mentality is so familiar that you can understand her reasoning for increasing the amount of pills she takes. The harsh reality of unattainable dreams is also displayed in her hallucinations of the television show she so desires to be on.The lives of each of these characters were depicted as so empty that they each had a dream that would, in their mind, make them a better person and offer them fulfillment. But it was their journey to these unattainable dreams that caused their inevitable downfalls. Aronofsky's brutal and at times unforgiving imagery was used not as a shock tactic, but more as an honest depiction of the reality of drugs and human frailty. Each of the confronting images featured in the film (those who have seen it will know which ones I mean) are used as a vehicle to reveal the vulnerability and weaknesses of each character, resulting in us being able to see our own vulnerabilities and insecurities in one or all of the characters.On face value, this is a movie about drugs and addiction, and yes, Aronofsky does a great job of portraying the horror and brutality of drug use. But this is a deeper film, one that illustrates the depths that humans are willing to sink to in order to live out their dreams. Unfortunately, the honest reality of the situation is that the distant hope that you are holding onto usually will not result in making you a better person or your life more meaningful.An excellent movie with brilliant performances from the leads and unique and insightful direction and cinematography. It will not make you smile, but the sheer forcefulness of the film and the confronting sense of reality it depicts will definitely evoke some sort of emotional response. Definetely a 9 out of 10 movie.",10,0,1,5 December 2001
