The Blair Witch Project," An experience in fear
","By far one of the most original concept for a movie, The Blair Witch Project is what any 'scary' film should aspire to be.While it is quite different from slasher movies like Scream or earlier productions such as the 'Friday the 13th' or 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series, I don't think this film is meant to be anything serious.For what it is, though, it is incredibly well done. While the actors are far from experienced, each performance is believable. After all, it was meant to be an amateur video. Unless you are not very fond of anything described as suspense, horror or thriller, you are sure to be haunted by this movie. It's not incredibly scary, but it gives you a rather unpleasant feeling. Some images will probably stay in your mind for a while. This is the first film of the genre where you really can't guess the ending. It is not something you can cut into scenes to look at good vs. bad parts. Either you love it or you hate it.It really was a project, an experience in cinematography...and I think it deserves all the praise.",Null,1,2,14 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," not so surprised...
","This movie isn't entirely without originality, but I was kind of disappointed. I was told that 'you can't guess the ending !'. Unless you've never read a Stephen King novel or any similar piece of literature, you'd best ignore this tagline if you want to enjoy the movie...It is a dark, haunting thriller. Bruce Willis and his young co-star are both fantastic ! Although I am sure that I've read an incredibly similar short story once, I must say that it is captivating...and scary.",Null,0,0,19 August 1999
