National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Excellent Movie
","I went to see this movie with my sister and we both went into it with an open mind knowing that it was no Oscar worthy movie and that it wasn't going to break any Hollywood conventions or clichés. With that being said, we both really enjoyed the movie! It plays out much like the first with the revealing of secret messages that they have to unscramble and different clues of that sort. The story line is fun and it reminded us both of a 'Goonies' for adults. So if you were a fan of the first or a 'Goonies' or summer action movie fan, go see this, you won't be disappointed it is a pure popcorn movie from beginning until end!",9,0,2,21 January 2008
The Village," Where'd he go?
","What happened to the director of the Sixth Sense? M. Night just dropped a notch on my list. The twist that Night is know for is weak in this movie. The direction is nothing to brag about and Night doesn't give the cast a good enough chance to show their talent. Why have such a top notch cast if you aren't going to use them properly? Sure some of them had their moments but they were held to a jog instead of a full out run. The movie did not meet the hype and the direction did not meet the standards for a freshman film project. Now wonder why the sci-fi channel had that mockumentary, they used it in order to beef up the interest so that they could get a big opening weekend and collect as much money as they can before everyone finds out what a stinker this is. I hope M. Night is able to bounce back from this one... Good luck Night. Sorry but I give it a 5.5 out of 10",Null,0,1,29 July 2004
30 Days of Night," Town in Alaska, 30 days of night, blood thirsty vampires... almost priceless
","30 DAYS OF NIGHT30 Days of Night abandons the cliché of the Romantic vampire and instead dives right into their primal nature. A town in Alaska, last sunset before being plunged into 30 days of darkness, a pack of bloodthirsty vampires... almost priceless. Being that I am an avid vampire film fan and love the allure of vampires in general, I was very pleased with this film. It puts a welcome twist on the vampire and we see them here as more a pack of wolves crying out their morbid call once they attack and feed on their prey. They attack their victims by slashing their sharp nails into their victims like a meat cleaver. They would also use a single victim as bait letting them walk the town crying out for help as they stalked along the roof tops. They even have their own primal language with noises and clicks. The look of a few the vampires was eerie, they had narrow and elongated faces with closely placed and angled eyes. I feel that all of the vampires should have had this look. The setting is a great one if you are a vampire, no sun for 30 days gives you a constant feeding frenzy not having to worry about the rise of the sun. This is what gives the film it's edge. You are right there on the edge of your seat watching and wondering how these poor townsfolk who are cut off from the rest of the world for 30 days will survive when they don't even have the hope to survive until morning when the sun comes up. This was almost a great film. Lots of blood and killing, a new approach to the vampire, a great setting and tense scenes throughout. The only thing this movie lacked was a little bit in the set up but I'm not sure it is really needed. However, we never find out where these vampires come from and how they got to Alaska. But the thing that really kills this films greatness is the ending. It just ends! Where did the vampires go and why, they just disappeared. It seems like the writer took the easy way out. Even though the ending was lame I still rank this as a must see and a must buy once the DVD comes out, my overall rating 8 of 10.",8,2,5,22 October 2007
Atonement," Oscar?
","Okay now I went to see this film because people were comparing it to Titanic, a film in which I liked very much. I also went to see it b/c I heard it will most likely be up for an Oscar. The film for me, however, was an overall let down. Sure the film was artistic and had symbolism in it but the story told did not engross me on the screen. There is no real build up of the love or connection between Cecilia and Robbie. Also there is no build up of the longing that Robbie and Cecilia feel for each other as I'm sure there is in the book. So basically there is no real love story although there is supposed to be. This left me with a rather flat view of the circumstances that were to be driving this film. In Titanic, you get the feeling that Rose and Jack have loved each other all of their lives when in fact they have not know each other for more than a week. In Atonement you only get the feeling that they have just met and that Robbie would like to get back to Cecilia; when what you should be getting is the sense that these two lovers are meant for each other and there is nothing that either of them won't do in order to be in each others arms again. I guess what this film is lacking is more obstacles and a lot more character and story development. No way should this film be up for an Oscar. Sure it's artistic but aren't films made to be entertaining, engrossing, and artistic? If so, there are more choices that I would put up for an Oscar before Atonement.",7,1,3,8 January 2008
