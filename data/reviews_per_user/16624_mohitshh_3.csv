Million Dollar Arm," More than just a Sports Biography
","IMDb says this a biography sports drama but i would call it more of a biography than a sports film. The story is about a sports agent in the US trying to save his career by thinking out of the box. He recruits two Indian youths (Rinku and Dinesh) belonging from poor Indian families and brings them to the US to get them trained by professional baseball coach.The film is based on a true story and I do not know whether the retelling is a bit dramatized for the sake of the screen or not. But, the movie clearly shows a transition in the character of JB. His little adventure of foraying into uncharted waters leads him to self realization. He comes to value the things which matter in life and I think this was one of the points the director was intending to make.The story of Rinku and Dinesh is also much tumultuous. They find themselves in the foreign land and struggling to adjust to their new lives. They have to dig deep to get their heart and soul into the game and find their fire so that they are able to shine at the right time. I cannot say more without inviting a spoiler tag.The music is wonderful and A R Rahman has done a good job as usual. The movie was able to reinvigorate even the clich√©d scenes like that of 'bypassing the system' :). By the way, not all Indians are like that.Being an Indo-US drama there are some scenes where the non desi population might call it to be over dramatic but they blend with the overall story perfectly. Also there is some dance and music sometimes at completely unexpected points in the film. This was included maybe to put some local touch. The film is an amalgamation of both cultures and it is more than just a sports biography. It is good enough to keep you cheerful for the major part.Do watch till the end as there are real life photos and videos of Rinku and Dinesh who have underwent a truly rags to riches transformation.",8,0,0,19 September 2014
Lucy," Pass on the knowledge
","A wonderful film posing interesting questions and also providing answers to some of those.Scarlett Johannson was awesome as always and Morgan Freeman did great in explaining everything like he always does. The movie is perfect blend of Science fiction and philosophy. It touches on various topics like the meaning of life, Existence of God, Potential of Human mind, Origin of the universe, The nature of man and his role in the universe, overcoming the limitations and hurdles in life.It kind of draws a parallel with the film 'limitless' in a way. But there is a difference in the message that both films give. In lucy, the main character dwells on the question of purpose of life and tries to think objectively and not subjectively. The science fiction stuff might have been a little overboard but its a science fiction in the end and has every right to venture in the unknown in order to have us flabbergasted. In my opinion it was not too eccentric. I liked the way the character of Scarlett evolves over time and is able to unlock the full potential of the human mind. I am unable to understand why this movie has been rated in the 6s. I think it deserves more than that.",9,3,9,5 October 2014
Princess Mononoke," Great movie with a great message
",I have heard a lot about this movie but never got the chance to watch it. Over the years it slipped right through my to-watch list and then one day I stumbled upon this title on IMDb and finally decided to see it.The movie is an excellent piece of art and has a lot of underlying meanings to it. It is about a village prince Ashitaka who gets cursed while saving his village from a demon. On his journey to find the dear god who will be able to heal the curse he comes across a village named iron-town led by Lady Eboshi. Eboshi is set out to destroy the deer god so that she can take over the forest for iron mining. The animal tribes of the forest are trying protect the forest. Princess Mononoke aka San has been brought up by the wolf tribe and is fighting the humans to save the forest.Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of this war and tries to see everything with unclouded eyes. He is able to see the suffering as well as good in both sides. His heart is wedded to San the first time he sees her and wants to have a life with her in peace. He tries to make everyone see that they can live together in harmony and tries to help both sides every time he gets an opportunity. He is the true definition of what a hero should be like.This movie is the story of human civilization itself and how we have recklessly destroyed nature for our needs and more often than not for our greed. This movie is an appeal to everyone to see with unclouded eyes and reason for themselves why we cannot live at peace with nature.There is one line in the film that 'to want everything between heaven and hell is the human nature'. Well Ashitaka is the person who proves this is not the case and there is still some good left in humanity.I have truly enjoyed watching this film and would surely recommend it for anyone who wants to experience something different and innovative.,9,0,1,20 July 2014
