Raiders of the Lost Ark," A+ action, no matter how you see it
","Now let me tell you something; Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) had put out some great action! Action which led to two other movies, and a fourth one in the works! I've watched this movie on DVD and it's great. Everything about this movie is so wonderful; so exciting; so great that whenever y'all see a man being chased by a big boulder, or switching out an idol with a bag of sand at an identical weight, y'all will think 'Indiana Jones!' The picture quality and sound quality of the DVD version is superior thanks to THX technology.'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is, by far, the best of all the Indiana Jones movies.",10,3,7,20 February 2006
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Great film...
","Yes, the dog movies continue in 1961 with 'One Hundred and One Dalmatians,' an animated movie about a person in England who had a whole lot of dalmatians!!!!! Suddenly, the evil Cruella De Vil wants those puppies; she wants to make a coat out of them! Can the puppies stop her? Can these 101 puppies be saved just in time????? Find out when you watch this excellent movie!What I like about this movie: That it's excellent! I've seen this on video as a little kid, had the tape and book story, and watched this on ABC a few years back. It is a good story with great action and it has puppies and dogs!!!!!Give '101 Dalamatians' 10 stars...no, no - 101 stars! That shows you that it's excellent in many ways!!!!!10/10",10,5,6,31 July 2006
Mulan," Amazing work!!!!!
","I must say, I am quite impressed with Disney's 1998 animated classic feature 'Mulan,' about a Chinese girl who had troubles attempting to bring honor to her family, until one night, her father, a soldier, wasn't feeling well to fight, so she disguised herself as a man so that she could fight in her father's place. She had a dragon, Mushu, who helped her out along the way. In this movie, this movie has nothing but hardcore action!!!!! This isn't your ordinary, everyday, run of the mill girl movie; no, no, no, this is a great one!!!!!This is a boy movie, too; I'm just saying that because there are a whole lot of Disney Princess movies out there!!!!!'Mulan' is an amazing feat to come to the cinema, and to Disney, too. I've seen this plenty of times and it never grows old on me.10/10",10,1,2,5 September 2006
The Rookie," So this is the last great thing made by Disney, huh?????
","An end of an era was released here in the States in Spring 2002 with 'The Rookie,' a Disney live action film that seemed to be the 'best for last!!!!!' It took place right here in Texas! Actually, the story began in West Texas, as evidenced by an area code found on a sign over there. It was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional!!!!!What I liked about this movie: It was sooo nice!!!!! It was a very good sports movie, ala 'The Mighty Ducks' trilogy. It had also taken moviegoers across Texas, from somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso all the way to the Metroplex (where I live). I can tell because I recognize that ballpark (was 'The Ballpark in Arlington;' now it's 'Ameriquest Field')! It was nice to see Disney's 'Golden Age' end here in my area!!!!!R.I.P.Golden Age of Disney1920s-Spring 2002'It all started with a mouse...and it ended with baseball.'

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," An un-needed sequel for such a 'bad' film!!!!!
","Well, the first movie was really bad because it's not family friendly, and the next movie is - guess what - also bad and lame!!!!! I'm sure it's exciting, but c'mon!!!!! The 'Bad Period' is enough for me as well as a bunch of other old school Disney fans, and like the last film, kids cannot watch this either!!!!! I'm shocked that there are PG-13 happy meals at Mickey D's; even late night talk show host David Letterman (who is such a huge fan of 'Zorro') hates this too!!!!! Here's proof:Top Ten Signs There's Something Terribly Wrong At McDonald's 10. Your order Filet-o-Fish and the cashier makes the sign of the cross 9.

Every year, hundreds of food and drug items come across his desk that seek approval from the FDA. Some make the grade; most do not. Larry sends Dave some of the items that do not meet the FDA's approval.1. If you've ever been an exhausted new parent wishing your baby would sleep more, you'll understand why the FDA put the kibosh on this one: It's Gerber's Red Bull.2. Everyone agrees that recycling is a good idea, but the FDA had to draw the line at: Swanson's Frozen Leftovers.'3. It's a fact: America has a child obesity problem. There is good news, though, thanks to the government, kids won't be drinking: Heinz Gravy Juice BoxesDave takes a moment to revisit the topic that's been bothering him all day. When he read the article, he admits to being stunned. Everyone else thought . . . . 'so?'4. The FDA admitted there was no actual health or safety issue with this one --- they were simply creeped out by: Lamb-flavored Colgate.5. The Agency's testers felt this product dangerously blurred the line between food and health and beauty aids: A-1 Steak Sauce and ConditionerDave throws out the Chunky-style Pepto-Bismol without ever reading the card.6. You have to give the tobacco companies this much: They try hard. But the FDA gave an emphatic thumbs-down to: Skoal Macaroni and Chaw.7. It seemed like a can't-fail idea: proved pain relief in a tasty new form. But the FDA quickly red-flagged this snack food: Honey-Roasted Tylenol.8. Convenience foods are more popular than ever. But the FDA wisely decided that the trend had gone a step too far with this product: Pre-cooked spaghetti.9. And finally, with so many bottled waters on the market, Poland Spring wanted a gimmick that would help them stand out from the crowd. But the FDA said, 'Absolutely not' to: Poland Spring Water with Goldfish. Dave holds up a bottle of Poland Spring. An actual goldfish swims inside.And that was our Rejected FDA Items.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Good...and bad.....
","Well, I have to say, this movie was such an exciting experience!!!!! I rented this one stormy night on DVD and boy, this movie was so exciting!!!!! This movie, of course, is based on the theme park ride at Disneyland and Disney World. I liked all the action and stuff in there; it was awesome!!!!! I especially liked the bonus features, too: there were the bloopers ('Is that a plane?????' - Johnny Depp heard a small jet rocket by the ship), and of course, the excerpt from 'Walt Disney Presents,' which I actually remembered seeing on the old Disney Channel one night in 1998.Buuuuuut, there is a problem. (OH NO!!!!! is right!!!!!)This is a 'BAD PERIOD' movie!!!!! That's right, for one, this movie totally changed the way we go to the parks now!!!!! The ride was changed to make it look like the movie now, and even worse, there are rumors that the Tom Sawyer ride at Disneyland will go away with - get this - a new ride based on this film!!!!! Plus, the worst part????? IT'S RATED PG-13!!!!! Yes, you heard right!!!!! A 'Disney' movie, given such a controversial rating so that families can't see this or any other movie in this series because it's too scary!!!!! So basically, Disney now robs of its usual audience in the 'Bad Period.''PIRATE DVDS OF THE EAST: THE CURSE OF THE MPAA'S FOCUS' is a film that, while it appeals to us adults, JUST DOES NOT APPEAL TO CHILDREN!!!!! Bad idea! -1000000/10 for making a grown company cry!!!!!",1,8,22,26 December 2006
Beauty and the Beast," This is Disney's best, and nothing can beat this one!
","This was the very first film I have ever seen in my whole life. I remember my Mom taking me to the theaters in 1991 (I was four at the time) to see this movie. This is no ordinary family movie; in fact, I think that this is the best family movie ever made. I am always excited whenever I see this movie. Heck, in March 2003, I bought the DVD of this movie so that I can finally own my favorite old-school Disney movie! That's how much I love 'Beauty and the Beast.' I miss all the great stuff that Disney used to put out at the time; I spent pretty much all of my childhood growing up with this kind of Disney entertainment! Now, we have mostly dull stuff from 2002 onwards, but some of it (like 'National Treasure,' for instance) is still good! Please, make this movie your favorite Disney movie now!",10,7,8,21 February 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Now this is exciting...
","I've seen this movie a few weeks ago on my college campus because I've always wanted to see this Disney version of 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.' I've seen previews for this movie and I thought it looked good because it reminded me of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but toned down for family viewing. (Oh yeah, it is good!) When I was there, it was so exciting! I loved pretty much every minute of this movie! I won't give any of it away because I want you to find out for yourself! This was a good movie, but I thought the 'Lord of the Rings' movies were more exciting. But still, this movie is very worthy of a '10' rating and I hope this will be one of the 250 best films ever made!",10,0,0,21 February 2006
Spider-Man 2," Better as time goes on...
","On my second-in-a-row trip to the United Kingdom in summer 2004, I was hoping that seeing this film would be an option for a night activity. And it was! Because of that, I signed up for it right away! Yeah, watching a movie in another country sure is a thrilling experience! And so is this movie! I have heard of certain movies where in later parts, it just gets on better! And this movie is such an excellent example! Like the first film, this film has more exciting action sequences, including one near the end of the movie! I gotta tell you something, if you have never seen any of the 'Spider-Man' movies, then you are missing out on something big and exciting!",10,0,1,21 February 2006
Spice World," People! People! Please!
","Movies with pop stars taking the silver screen are the best in the world! No joke, people! No joke! And this movie is such a notable example! Yeah, I remember the late 90s very well; in addition to all the young girls screaming for bands like 'N*Sync,' 'The Backstreet Boys,' '98 Degrees' and others, as well as voting for such music videos on TRL on un-MTV (LOL), there was a girl band all the way across the pond from the greatest country in the universe, the United Kingdom! And they were known as...the Spice Girls! So people, if you like Europe, or England, or if you're a guy who needs a good movie with lots and lots of pretty English girls in it, then this is the one! 10 stars out of 10 stars! Yes!",10,3,6,17 February 2006
Finding Nemo," One of the Disney and Pixar Team's Worst...
","When my family rented this movie, it's an excellent thing I was working on a school project while this movie was made - they didn't like this movie! The first time I've actually seen this movie for myself was in Spanish sound with English subtitles in my Spanish II class back in early 2004. While I was awake to fully comprehend the Spanish and the English words very well, the movie itself seemed mostly boring and not-up-to-it to me. I've finished watching this in English when my family was in a limo in Florida. I was glad when the movie was finally over! But the real saving grace of this movie, however, is the aquarium screen saver on the DVDs; I put the tiki one up on the limo screens! But still, pass.",1,5,25,21 February 2006
Home Alone," A Holiday Tradition Since 1990!
","This is my favorite holiday movie! Yes, that MUST mean that I am a caring person (because it's sweet and funny)! I didn't see this because I was 3 at the time (and I didn't watch movies in a theater until 1991), but I have seen this on TV every year and I used to watch the DVD and VHS versions of this! And yes, they are all great! And so are things like using a fake movie to scare pizza delivery guys and burglars away, using train sets with sticks and cardboard people and loud music to fool people into think that there's a party going on, and more! 'Home Alone' is, in fact, one of the greatest holiday movies ever made. What else is there to say?",10,1,2,21 February 2006
The Jungle Book," I like the animals; I like Baloo and Shere Khan the best!!!!!
","1967 had brought us a wonderful animated feature from Disney called 'The Jungle Book.' It had taken place in the jungle; there was a boy in the jungle, and he hung out with some wild, musical animals! The two I know the most are Baloo and Shere Khan; they would end up being characters in 'TaleSpin' in the early 90s. (Oh, and don't forget Louie, too!!!!!) The most memorable part is the song 'Bare Necessities,' which gets us into a 'jungle boogie' while basking in the greatness this film has to offer!!!!!'The Jungle Book' is marvelous. It's a great family film, and a sad thing to say: this was released around the same time the man of this company, Walt Disney, had died. May he rest in peace.(1901-1967)10/10",10,0,2,31 July 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Wonderful!
","Last summer, I watched a lot of DVD movies. I decided to look at this website for some good movies to watch, and I had come upon this movie, 'Hotel Rwanda.' I heard that this movie is excellent, so I decided to give this one a shot.I thought everything about the film was excellent. This movie was based on a true story, and everything in this movie was all exciting and dramatic. Being a huge fan of movies and watching DVDs, I say that 'Hotel Rwanda' is a highly recommended movie for those who have such an interest.Oh, and by the way, look for the odd thing out during the vault scene, too!",10,1,1,20 February 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," (yawns) Boring!!!
","Now, I apologize if I am giving negativity towards 'Dr. Strangelove,' but while most people find this funny and excellent (and near the top of the list of the greatest comedies ever made), I feel different about this film.First off, people claim this to be a comedy. Yeah, right; what is there to laugh about in this film? I'm sure many things; but for a person like me, I guess I don't understand that type of humor that much to really appreciate this film.And also, when people claim this to be such a great film, are y'all talking 'Citizen Kane'-type excellence? I nearly died watching this film; that's how bored I was! When I heard the 'Mein Fuhrer! I can walk!' line, that had given me a jolt out of my seat! But still, I give this three stars because you gotta love those flight sequences!",3,8,23,20 February 2006
Glory," This is a good civil war film!
","I've seen this movie twice now - once as a sophomore in high school in U.S. History class, and on the two-disc special edition DVD. This is a good movie to watch for historical and educational values, but of the two times I've watched this movie, I prefer the 2-disc DVD over the VHS. Why? For two reasons: 1. You have a choice of two aspect ratios (one for each DVD disc): the original 2.35:1 widescreen aspect on the blue disc, disc 1, or the cropped 1.33:1 fullscreen aspect on the red disc, disc 2. I've watched the widescreen version first and the fullscreen version twice (reason later).2. You have lots of languages to choose from. The widescreen version has English and French audio, but the fullscreen ratio has not only those two languages, but Spanish and now Portuguese as well! And both discs have English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai subtitles (and some websites mention Indonesian as well even though that is really not an option)! I've watched this in Spanish (like I do with many DVDs) and Portuguese (just for fun) and it was great! This is one DVD that should be viewed immediately!",10,6,8,21 February 2006
The Bourne Identity," Ka-boom!
","This sure is a great action thriller. It's especially better in the DVD format, mainly because of the sound used in this film. Most DVDs with Dolby 5.1 sound are, well, one step up from stereo, but the 5.1 on this movie - boy, is it powerful or what? It seems as if the studio checked, double-checked, and triple-checked the 5.1 tracks just to give the viewer the ultimate surround sound experience! So even if you don't own a large home theater system and you only watch your DVDs through your television speakers (let it be stereo or mono [!]) or headphones, and even if action movies aren't your forte, then watch this DVD anyway. It'll knock your socks off!",10,0,1,16 January 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The first of a wonderful trilogy of the 2000s...
","The 1970s have brought us 'Star Wars' and this continued on throughout today. In the 1980s, it was 'Indiana Jones.' From the dusk of an old millennium to the start of a new one, many movies have garnered sequels which formed trilogies - 'The Matrix,' 'Spider-Man,' and this one - 'The Lord of the Rings.' From 2001 until 2003, three movies were released - one for each year (during the holiday season, of course): this one, 'The Two Towers,' and 'The Return of the King.' This movie starts off slow, but then the tension and the excitement builds as we move on! This is one great aspect about the 'Lord of the Rings' series.I've seen all three movies on DVD (the original versions), and I enjoyed them very much. Hopefully, you will too! Enjoy 'The Lord of the Rings!'",10,0,0,20 February 2006
Duck Soup," The Marx Bros. make me laugh!
","My family rented an ancient VHS of this Marx Bros. movie a few years ago. (I've seen bits and pieces of this movie before.) And yes, this was so funny! For a movie that old, with no special effects, everything moving fast, black and white film, and a part where no sound is transmitted at all whatsoever, what else is there to it about 'Duck Soup?' I also think many parts of this film is funny, but I don't want to give away anything at all because some of y'all may have never seen 'Duck Soup' before! The only wish, however, is that this movie is yet to be re-released on DVD sometime soon. That way, everyone can have a great laugh!",10,1,2,21 February 2006
Spider-Man," This is an excellent film! Wow!
","'Wow' is right. From when I first heard about this movie to when I actually rented the DVD (thus being the first time I've seen this movie), I thought that 'Spider-Man' looked like an extreme thrill ride! Exciting from the very first minute on! And in summer of 2004, I rented the DVD, and guess what? I was right! This IS an exciting film! In fact, I've made this my favorite action film! I guess I made such an excellent decision about renting this film back in the June of 2004. Why? Because that summer, I was going to go see 'Spider-Man 2' in the theater! And that was a very short time from then! I could give this 11 stars if I could (or how about 100?), but I can't, so this is a 10-star film!",10,1,2,21 February 2006
The Little Mermaid," 'Under the sea!!!!!'
","In 1989, Disney has made a terrific masterpiece that ended up winning two Oscars (ah, yes; winning awards was what Disney has done the best!): 'The Little Mermaid,' an animated motion picture based on the story by Hans Christen Andersen (spelling?) that was loved by many children and it still is today!!!!!Ariel, the mermaid, had a dream: she wanted to live life out of the ocean and wanted to be human because she was interested in a man on a ship. It is not only a wonderful family film; it's also a very nice love story with lots of music (Hearing that lobster character (sorry, I forgot the name) sing songs like 'Under the Sea' and 'Kiss the Girl' are very great; Ariel also sang 'Part Of Your World' as well)!!!!!Some of you (even your Blockbuster) might have the 1999 fullscreen Limited Issue version, but wait about a month for the 2-DVD version with widescreen, bonus features, and more!!!!!'The Little Mermaid' is a delight for all.10 stars.",10,2,2,29 August 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not the best of the trilogy, but still pretty good!
","I've seen all the original parts of 'The Lord of the Rings' on DVD. I thought 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Return of the King' were the best of the trilogy, but what about this one ('The Two Towers')? Obviously, I didn't think this was as good as the first and the third parts of the trilogy, but it was still good. The battle sequence near the end was pretty much the high point of the second movie, but everything before that didn't have a whole lot of action attached to it.Of course, I would never, ever, ever give any of the 'Lord of the Rings' movies anything below a seven or so, so I am giving this an eight. At least more exciting action was found in the movie that came after!",8,1,2,20 February 2006
The Incredibles," Not the best movie, but still some good stuff all around!
","Being such a huge fan of the DVD medium, I heard about how great a DVD this was (in fact, the best DVD of 2005, actually!) so I decided to watch 'The Incredibles' and check it out! I like Disney movies; I just don't like the Pixar ones that much, except for 'Toy Story 2.' I didn't think this movie was really that good, although the action sequences, the Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound in English and Spanish, and the clarity of the picture made for such an 'Incredible' DVD! The bonus features were great, too; I especially liked the 'Jack Jack Attack' short! I was laughing! Please, DVD fans. Don't let a great DVD like this one pass you by!",6,0,2,20 February 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not your average Joe movie...
","One night, I was in a dorm room of my friend's. I was there to do something quick, but since he wasn't in the room, I decided to try out his entertainment system. Deciding on which DVD to put in, I chose this one. And when the movie starts...Bam! You are off in a totally alternate world with one of Taratino's finest! Everything about this movie is a lot different from all the other movies - everything about this film just seems so postmodern! I can tell not only from when this movie was made, but when I was a junior in high school, my final project of the year in my English class of the time was to make a postmodern novel using various objects (like a scrapbook, you see). This is what this movie is like.I think if you are a huge fan of action movies and DVDs, and if you understand the whole postmodern thing very well, then the 'Kill Bill' movies are right for you. (I have yet to watch Volume 2.)",10,0,3,21 February 2006
Toy Story 2," The Only Good Movie From Pixar.
","Out of all the movies made by Disney and Pixar, 'Toy Story 2' is the best. In fact, this makes the first part long-forgotten! (Not to mention that this is better as well.) This movie is also happier and funnier as well. I liked Al from Al's Toy Barn; he reminded me of Newman from 'Seinfeld!' (He's Wayne Knight) I always laugh at him the same way I do whenever I watch that show! Plus, the whole concept of 'Toy Story 2' is much better than the first also. I have yet to watch this on DVD; I heard that the DVDs of the two 'Toy Story' movies are excellent! And as a closing, this was the very last movie I ever saw in the theater in 1999! (Excellent!)",10,0,2,21 February 2006
National Treasure," It had everything I wanted out of an action film!
","Thank you very, very much, Disney, for making your 2004 holiday season much better than your 2003 holiday season! Anyways, here's the reason. Two words: National Treasure. This is one of my favorite films (in fact, it's my favorite New Disney film and one of my favorite action films)! Why? Well, first off, this is an action film that just about anybody can watch! Well, it's Disney and it's PG, right? Second, the whole path of this film flows extremely well - not only do we go up the East Coast after twenty minutes into the film or so, but the idea of finding a huge treasure - which had taken pretty much all of time just to get here - sounds exciting! In fact, this movie is so good that not only was I excited about waiting for the DVD, but I always tell my family to rent this every time we upgrade our living room entertainment center: They get a new DVD/VCR combo, I ask them if they could rent this movie; they get a new widescreen TV, I ask them if they could rent this movie! Maybe when they get a 5.1 system (I highly doubt that will happen), I'll ask them for it again! Yes, it's that great!",10,2,6,21 February 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," A favorite for 60 years (beginning this Christmas)!
","'It's a Wonderful Life' is my mom's favorite Christmas movie ever. In fact, this movie is a well-loved holiday movie by many people around the world, whether or not they love movies so much or that they even like such a type of movie (old movies)! I've seen this for many years also, and I didn't actually fully understand the whole premise, the whole meaning of this movie until last holiday. Oh sure, I had always known what this movie was about, but due to it being so old and in black and white and not color, I'm sure people would understand.Actually, this is not my favorite holiday movie, but at least this is a very decent family movie!",10,1,5,20 February 2006
Hercules," 'Hercules...Hercules...Jerk-ules...'
","BTW, that was from the trailer (Hades called him Jerk-ules, LOL)Disney's 1997 animated feature 'Hercules' puts the excitement in Greek mythology. Yes, I am very familiar with Greek myths, and although we don't care much about this film anymore because it doesn't really follow the original myths of Hercules, I still really like this movie!!!!! Yes, there are characters other than Hercules, Zeus, Athena, Hades, etc. that have been added on for enjoyment, but it's still very exciting, indeed.Some of the characters that I have liked the most included Hades; here, because it's a Disney film, he is bad, but not really bad like in the myths. He is a funny little demon; he is an extremely fast talker: 'You kiss, you snooze, etc.' (Try saying that 5 times fast!!!!!)'Hercules' is the movie to watch for big time fun!!!!!10 stars",10,1,5,5 September 2006
Jaws," An exciting disaster film; also one of Spielberg's first!
","I have seen 'Jaws' oh-so-many times. I first seen this movie on TNT back in 1998; then I've seen the 25th Anniversary version on ABC in 2000; and finally, I've seen the 25th Anniversary version again on DVD last summer before starting classes. (The 30th Anniversary DVD is now out, but at the time, my library only had the 25th year version.) From the swimming scene at the beginning and all throughout the film, during various scenes, everything is exciting! Intense! Fun! This is also one of Steven Spielberg's very first films he has directed, and I think all of his films are terrific! Even this one! While the other 'Jaws' movies may not be up to par (funny thing; this one's in the Top 250 while the last one is in the Bottom 100), this is and always will be the best of the 'Jaws' series.",10,1,3,21 February 2006
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to enjoy we go.....
","Ah, yes. I have always loved the good old days of Walt Disney and his excellent, extraordinary family entertainment. This movie is a notable mention.'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is Walt Disney's first major animated motion picture. Made way, way, way back in time (1937), this movie had everything: Snow White, the seven dwarfs (Bashful, Grumpy, Sneezy, Doc...anybody else?), and, of course, an evil witch with an evil mirror! Bwahahahahahaha!!!!!It may have been, like, forever since I've seen this movie, but I'd have to say it's great! This movie spawned three video releases, including the DVD in 2001, which put Disney DVD right on the map, making DVDs the most enjoyable thing we have today!What else could I say about this stroke of genius? Oh yeah, that I give it 10 out of 10 and all of you new school Disney fans should do the same, too! Good-bye!",10,2,3,30 July 2006
The Lion King," Very good movie; Very good story; SIMBA OWNS
","Disney made another solid A in cinemas everywhere around the world in 1994 with 'The Lion King,' a very nice animated film.It is about Simba, a young lion whose father was Mufasa, the original king of the Pride Lands. That opening scene where Rafiki broke open the gourd, made a mark on Simba's head with the juice and dust and lifted him towards the sun from Pride Rock is the most recognizable scene of the movie, because that's how it all began. As Simba had grown up, he had to learn about his issues in life, try to stay away from trouble (that scene where Mufasa and Simba had a long talk 'SIMBA, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, etc.' TOTALLY taught Simba a lesson; after that was the whole 'Look at the stars' thing), and later, as a wildebeest stampede, started by Scar, killed Simba's father, now Simba had to grow up all alone and try to figure this whole thing out all by himself.Later, Simba was lost in the desert with vultures and stuff, and here, enter Timon and Pumbaa. This recognizable phrase, Hakuna Matata, started to change Simba's life, as well as moviegoers', forever! Then we see Simba, Pumbaa, and Timon (with his funny walk) walk across the log in the night, with Simba becoming an adult! Simba then had fallen in love with Nala, and later on, when Simba was worried, Rafiki had come to him, told Simba to look in the water, and Simba decided to return to Pride Rock to become king.Pride Rock was a bad wasteland; how sad was that. Suddenly, Simba realized that Scar killed Mufasa, and so, they battled on Pride Rock with a fire below!!!!! Simba won, and all was restored, and that beginning scene? This time, with Simba and Nala, we see it again, and thus ends the movie.'The Lion King' is a terrific film. It had memorable scenes, good lessons, and nothing but Disney Magic. I've seen this in the movies in '94 and the re-release in '95, we had the video for some time, and this played on the Old Disney Channel in the late 90s. Go watch it; I think your life will change forever.10 out of 10",10,1,1,3 September 2006
The Emperor's New Groove," I feel a grooove comin' on here.....
","In the holiday season, 2000, Disney released a very different animated feature called 'The Emperor's New Groove.'What's so different about it? The many 'new' things that we now remember about movies and stuff:<ul><li>'Pull the lever, Kronk!!!!! WRONG LEVER !!!!!'</li></ul><ul><li>The fun of riding a roller coaster down underground!!!!!</li></ul><ul><li>What you say when you do something cool: 'Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!!!!!'</li></ul>Plus many more!!!!!I like this film; it's a very good story with very good animation; it is very family safe; never a dull moment here!!!!!'The Emperor's New Groove' is the film to watch if you are in a bad mood. If you're not in a bad mood, then go ahead and see it!!!!! It'll be good for the mind, the body, the soul, and, oh yeah, the groove!!!!!10/10",10,1,3,7 September 2006
Cinderella," A great masterpiece - don't miss it!!!!!
","First off, I want to say, 'Thanks, Disney, for finally releasing the 'Cinderella' movie on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated films on DVD (including the 1999 Limited Editions)! What are you going to do next? You're going to Disney World!!!!!' Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle!!!!!)Anyways, Disney remains magical in his 1950 animated classic film 'Cinderella,' the movie that put fairy tale movies on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying 'Bippity- boppity-boo!,' and of course, trying to head home by midnight!What I like about this film: It's a grand old fairy tale that children like, now in a movie form (as well as on DVD as well)!!!!!'Cinderella' - thank you, Disney!!!!! 10 stars.",10,0,1,30 July 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Yes! The last of the 'LotR' series, and this one's the best!
","Before I started college, I watched a bunch of DVDs, including all the original versions of Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. I liked part 1: 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' and part 2: 'The Two Towers' was not the best of the trilogy, but at least everything was set up for this movie - the final chapter in the trilogy! Back when I saw this for the first time on DVD, this was the third best movie ever made (now this is the 4th best movie ever made with 'The Godfather: Part II' taking that spot, another movie I plan on watching in the future) and this is the best action movie ever made according to this website. I definitely agree - all the action sequences are breathless! However, the very last 20 minutes of this film were too slow for me - but at least that meant that all good things must come to an end, huh? It also shows that the three parts had a connection which flowed very nicely: starting at the bottom, then going up to the climax, and then going back down again.Before you watch this movie, I must warn you that this movie is 3 hours and 20 minutes long! Here's my plan: watch a part a day; this will make watching 'Lord of the Rings' more exciting! And be sure that you're watching the original movies first. If you like DVDs and watching action films, then these movies are right for you.",10,3,6,20 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Excellent! The beginning of a dream...
","All I can say is that 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope' is the best, in my opinion, of all six 'Star Wars' films.I've seen this movie in just about every viewing method possible (both versions), and no matter how I view it, this movie is always the same. Combining the retroness of the 1970s with that of the future, 'Star Wars' is in a different breed of sci-fi entertainment - nothing cheesy like the old 1950s monster or space drive-in movies, and nothing too arty and ordinary like the space movies of recent fare. Lucas and his team have done an excellent job with 'Star Wars.' Oh sure, the recent movies may not be up to par like the original ones do, but still, this is a movie series that will forever be stuck in every human's life.'Star Wars' is one movie that should never be missed. If you've never seen 'Star Wars' in your life, then you need a reality check!",10,5,7,20 February 2006
Tarzan," Another awesome jungle adventure!!!!!
","Well, Disney does it again!!!!! (In a good way, of course.)Disney tried once again at their 'jungle of creativity' with Summer 1999's awesome action- packed animated feature, 'Tarzan.'This is not your father's Tarzan!!!!! No, this is a better, updated version of it based on Edgar Rice's series of books. I loved this movie because it was full of action; plus, it was very cool: I loved those scenes where Tarzan was flying through the jungle!!!!! And no, it wasn't just swinging and going 'Ahhhh-ah-ah-ah-ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!' It was vine surfing; kind of like what Tony Hawk would do with his skateboard!!!!!Some parts were funny, too: the apes trashing the camp, and don't forget when Tarzan thought 'Gorilla' was a piece of chalk and 'Clayton' was the sound of a gun!!!!! LOL'Tarzan' is a fun movie to watch at any age in life. I've seen it a few times, and I liked it!!!!!10/10",10,1,1,6 September 2006
Aladdin," Let's make some magic!!!!!
","BTW, if you want to read my review for 'Beauty and the Beast,' look way, way back into my reviews. Thank you.Now, 'Aladdin' is the 1992 animated flick from Walt Disney that is based on an old tale about, well, Aladdin!!!!! Here, Aladdin is confronted in the windy desert by a giant tiger's head. He and Abu could enter the 'Cave of Wonders' just to get the lamp, but nothing else. As Aladdin picks up the lamp, suddenly:Abu picked up the ruby!!!!! Now the cave turned into a volcano-like place and they were trapped!!!!! Suddenly, they discover a genie and all is good from then on.I won't tell anymore, but I suggest that you watch 'Aladdin!!!!!' It's good Disney fun!!!!!10 stars",10,1,1,29 August 2006
Pocahontas," Good history!!!!!
","Disney made this film in 1995. It's called 'Pocahontas,' and it's an animated film!!!!! This movie took place back in the days of early Colonial America. Some of the characters of this film have included John Smith, and, well, the lady Indian Pocahontas!!!!! You may have learned about this from the history books!!!!!What I liked about this film: It was a very serious film; not as good as the other films, but still good and memorable. This movie had taught us lessons, whether they were morals or just interesting educational facts from American History. I remember seeing this film twice back in 1995, and I thought that it was impressive.'Pocahontas' is a very good film that peers us back in time to the days of pre-American times. Watch it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!10 stars",10,3,9,4 September 2006
Back to the Future," Look no further...this is the greatest non-ordinary movie ever!
","I love the 'Back to the Future' movies so much! These movies are a part of my life. In fact, I know about 99.9% of just about everything to memory! Plus, every time I watch these movies, I always find something new, interesting, or something that never really caught on to me before! That is how much I love 'Back to the Future.' I like part one because this is where it all begins. The beginning part with the dog feeder (the robotic arm, electric can opener, and a very funny whirring noise) and quite possibly the biggest amp in the history of the universe with that weird, rising ethereal hum got me on the floor, not only laughing, but imitating that part of the film, too! What about everything in Marty's house, from the TV playing 'The Honeymooners' rerun to that ugly Panasonic clock radio? Priceless! Ooh, don't forget the JCPenney lot of the mall (which will remain unnamed because I'm not turning on the spoiler alert for this review) with the van and the DeLorean time machine coming out! Just watch this movie for more stuff! Oh, and to let y'all know: I've seen the three movies on DVD and I love them very, very much!",10,4,5,21 February 2006
The Godfather," Great movies...great times...
","Before I started college, I watched a bunch of DVDs. A couple notable titles were 'The Lord of the Rings' (actually a series) and 'The Godfather.' Both are excellent movies that are deserving of the top spots in 'best movies ever made.' However, I was extremely excited when I was waiting for this film.Everything about 'The Godfather' is not like any other film period - the story is strong, the film-making is excellent, the directing is spectacular - and at first, I thought the film was going to be three hours long! (The last 'Lord of the Rings' movie clocks in, for the original version, at 3 hours 20 minutes!) This movie is, in fact, about 20 minutes shorter, which was a relief after finishing the 'Lord of the Rings' series.And yes, I can easily see why this movie got the top spot in IMDb's '250 Best Movies Ever Made' list. After seeing this, I started looking at bad movies like crazy just so that I could say 'Been there, done that!' Hey, I love my movies! 'The Godfather' is a highly recommended movie. No one should enjoy their movies without this title!",10,1,4,20 February 2006
