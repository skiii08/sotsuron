Skyfall," This is why revenge films don't work.
","Making a James Bond film is a challenge and being part of the club is something unique in of itself. It seems to me the more recent James Bond films are made by directors who really want to do something different, but the classic formula is still lingering in the wings. The directors are trying to buck the trend in any way they can, but the net result is still a Bond film... just without the charm and whit of the classics. Skyfall falls into the same trap as the last few films, it tries so desperately to buck the trend with more realism, phenomenal cinematography, simple stunts which aren't too over the top and a fantastic cast that not only works, but is well directed. With these elements, you'd expect this film to be a winner, but unfortunately this time around, it isn't a Bond film anymore. What most filmmakers don't understand about James Bond films is quite simple; the cheesiness is what makes them great. The charm and whit of the classics, the bad guys who want to rule the world, the imprisonment of Bond with a countdown clock before some laser cuts him in half. These elements are what is lacking in the last three films. Daniel Craig's presentation of Bond is more modern and the filmmakers feel they need to 'update' Bond, where the truth of the matter is, we go to Bond films to see the cheesiness, to see the gadgets, the one-liners, etc. This new Bond film falls into the same trap as the last few have, its just another action film with characters from the Bond franchise, NOT a James Bond movie. There is nothing wrong with that, its still an entertaining and well made movie, but its lacking the soul which makes REAL Bond films. Skyfall has one other small issue, which is the simple fact its a revenge film with almost no character development. So the audience is left scratching their head, wanting more, but not understanding WHY they want more. Its quite the conundrum and I'm anxious to see the deleted scenes on video. In summary, its a very entertaining action film. The production value is through the roof, the acting is top notch, the directing is good, but it just isn't quite a Bond film. The identity doesn't exist and unless the next film is super cheesy and over the top, I'm afraid the Bond franchise has lost its charm.One side-note, I love Thomas Newman, but he is the wrong guy to score a Bond film. It was the most distracting and non-Bond score I've ever heard. It feels like the entire post production was rushed and detracts from the over-all 'bondness' of the film.",7,6,12,9 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One; The Uninspired generic 'family Friendly' blockbuster
",":cough: Let me begin by stating the obvious... Disney is the wrong studio to be involved with the Star Wars franchise. They are a bunch of pencil pushers who are only interested in churning out one 'safe' movie after the other. What they fail to realize is the 'Star Wars' franchise is bigger then anything else they've had and it's FAN driven, so millions will go no matter how dark or dialog driven the movie is.With that out of the way, 'Rogue One' is a poorly conceived, single plot action film that if it weren't for some good acting, decent sets/costumes and the 'Star Wars' name attached, would have bombed at the box office. Why? Because frankly, it's uninteresting. All of the great and interesting dialog scenes that would have helped generate sub stories to keep the audience interested, simply didn't exist. It's as if this movie was a sequel and the previous movie had all the information we needed, yet this isn't a sequel. 'Rogue One' is a unique movie that fits between Episode III and Episode IV, featuring only TWO of the characters from the entire 'Star Wars' Franchise. Yes, there are brief cameo's with other characters, but that doesn't count. Worst off, TWO of those characters are 100% CG and they just look like crap. It's as if the filmmakers never watched a single 'Star Wars' movie and/or never understood what made them decent, even the not-so-hot prequels had their moments. Even 'The Force Awakens' was 'entertaining' with far more complexity and overlapping plot lines. Still, 'Rogue One' feels more like a dumbed down 'The Force Awakens' then anything else in the franchise. Heck the filmmakers couldn't even be bothered to put the standard 'Star Wars' introductory story brief before the start of the movie. They threw that out the door, even though it COULD have told the audience what they SHOWED over the course of the first 20 minutes, which were a train wreck of back story and filler story to bring the audience up to speed. Three paragraphs could have answered all of those questions, but then they wouldn't have been able to show off the special effects wizardry.Unlike 'The Force Awakens' which is saved by it's 'classic' cast and more similarities to the world of 'Star Wars', 'Rogue One' makes some very well thought out attempts, but doesn't cash in on them. Yes, the cast is good and strong, but they're all worthless underdeveloped characters, thrown in because they're 'cool'. Yes, the sets are spot-on, but they spoil them by using heavy CG which makes set extensions, ships and space battles, look like every other stupid Hollywood movie. Even technical things like the score, were boring and uninteresting. I was shocked because John Williams had already written so much music for the franchise, all they needed to do was tweak it slightly and they would have had a pretty decent score. The surround mix was very flat, with only a few dynamic hits, but no crispness at all. It's like spent all their time trying to make it even, without even contemplating dynamic range. This is probably thanks to Disney not wanting general audiences complaining about how 'loud' it seemed. Even the mix had to be super 'safe', which is a load of ballix. I could go on all night about the flat and uninteresting cinematography and over-use of CG as well, but those two things are to be expected in a world of tent pole blockbusters like these. Fifteen minutes into 'Rogue One' I was already done with the movie. I was done because the plot was so tripe, it was so been there, done that, I knew exactly how it was going to end. There was no reason for me to waste two hours, but I continued to watch. Then we were introduced to the stupid robot character who was there only for comedy relief. Then everything that came out of his mouth was written for 8 year olds. That was about the moment I was going to walk out. I grabbed my things and was over it, but they threw some eye candy at the screen and I stuck around. I felt bad for the set's and actors honestly because they were playing around in this cool world, that we the audience weren't allowed to explore. In the end, 'Rogue One' is one rotten tomato, thanks to Disney exec's to scared to release the ACTUAL movie, prior to re-shoots. I could see rough outlines of the original movie as I watched and was dismayed to have not seen the original cut. It's hard as a filmmaker to have your movie taken away, but it's even harder as the masses to watch something that COULD have been great. This movie COULD have been awesome, they sure had so many great elements, but it failed miserably and if audiences see the same movie I did, we won't see the same box office numbers as 'The Force Awakens'. Maybe then Disney will recognize their failure, but I have a feeling they'll make plenty of money and push it under the rug.6/10 2 and 1/2 stars.",6,7,14,16 December 2016
The Hateful Eight," One step forward for film two steps back for Quentin Tarantino
","This year has been pretty uneventful film wise. With a few decent indy's and very few decent studio films, the expectations were high for the 'end of year' academy nod films like 'The Revenant', 'Carol' and 'Hateful Eight'. I personally have been excited about 'Hateful Eight' since I learned about it being shot on 70mm using Ultra Panavision anamorphic lenses, photochemical finish and distribution on 70mm. Being a cinephile, my excitement for 'Hateful Eight' was pretty high and after watching some test footage in June at cinegear expo, I was aesthetic with the results and was looking forward to the final piece. I was able to see 'Hateful Eight' about three weeks before it's release during a special private screening for industry members. I was extremely excited and I wasn't shocked when I left the theater dismayed with what I saw. I knew from the very first trailer, I wouldn't like the film. The score, cinematography, acting and beautiful locations, couldn't help the weak, unrealistic and completely plagiarized story. Yet, I was excited to see it as many times as I could, to get the 70mm experience and see how different theaters presented it. After my third screening, I've come to terms with 'Hateful Eight', it's pro's and con's. It's very easy to come down on this film harshly. It's a bloody massacre with some audience cringing moments that are really unnecessary. Its also a pretty weak story, a re-hash of Duel at Ichijoji Temple mixed with some classic television western's. However, Quentin clearly wanted to make an almost silly western, something over the top and very circumstantial, that was his goal. After meeting him in person and talking about the film a bit, I understood what he was trying to do and ya know what, it actually does work. Now, I'm not personally in love with 'Hateful Eight', I think it could have been a lot better. However, it's fantastic cinematography, wonderful score, beautiful locations, excellent production design, fantastic costumes and phenomenal cast, really make it worth watching. Those who can get past the rip off nonsensical story, who can laugh at the silly moments and enjoy a fun piece of entertainment, will really get a lot out of this movie. It's nowhere near the caliber of 'Inglorious Bastards' or 'Django', both of which were masterpieces of cinema, but it's not that far away. I have a hard time giving it a bad score because I did see it three times in the theater! I also can't give it an excellent score because it's not excellent. So I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10, which is pretty realistic in my world.",7,3,21,26 December 2015
Interstellar," Such a brilliant concept, very few people understand it
","Interstellar brings back the way science fiction and adventure films use to be made. The story is about Cooper, a frustrated former NASA pilot/engineer who is forced to be a farmer in not-to- distant future. Technology has let the human race down, as society focuses on growing crops for the ever expanding population, rather then exploration. Even in school, children are taught the future is here on earth, not in the stars. It's that exploration in all of us, which is squelched and leads to Coopers internal frustration. A seemingly random anomaly leads Cooper to discover a hidden NASA base, where the plot thickens and a rescue mission is being launched with a bunch of rookies/scientists in order to figure out what happened to a lost mission sent into a mysterious black hole, only a few years earlier. They were in search of an inhabitable world to 'move' the population of earth onto or build a new colony from scratch using embryo's. They were in need of a mission commander and Cooper wanting to explore in order to save earth, decides to leave his boring farmer life to his son and head into space with the rookies. What starts out as a few year rescue mission to determine what happened to the lost crew, turns into a multi-decade train-wreck. Explorers hoping to find 'new worlds' which can sustain life and in reality finding nothing but uninhabitable planets. Further frustration ensues when the project developer and lead scientist admits his data was faulty and the whole journey was for nothing. Having wasted so much time on a futile mission, turning back towards home seemed almost irrelevant. From that point to the end is Nolan's big secret, which can be summed up in a quick paragraph. There had been an on-going conflict on earth between scientists at NASA about gravity and how to control it. The data they needed to make the experiments a success, couldn't be gathered without going to the center of the black hole and taking readings. However, how does one get those readings back to earth? This is the most interesting and exciting premise of the entire film, one of which I will absolutely not spoil. Suffice to say, it's very self explanatory and quite an interesting concept. The frustrating part about Interstellar has nothing to do with the film itself, it has to do with the public perception of the film. Christopher Nolan has admitted several times, the concept for Interstellar will go over the heads of an average audience member. The studio wasn't concerned and they clearly funded his new adventure, knowing without a doubt, it would be a success. So far it's revenues are over half a billion dollars world wide, so he has done something right. Interstellar is a film you have to see more then once. Extremely important details are given in a glance, or a single line of dialog. The absolutely fantastic score and brilliant cinematography are so engrossing and overpowering, it's very difficult to hear the dialog. Nolan very cleverly uses music/effects, editing and shot composition to heighten excitement within a given scene. Some may find it over-powering and thus difficult to comprehend.My first screening at the Cinerama Dome in 70mm, I was blown away. Just the concept was awe inspiring, what he tried to tackle in one film was an immense subject matter. Part of me wished he had split it into two haves like an old roadshow film. On second viewing, same theater, same print with a different group of people, it was even better. I absolutely love how the film physically hits you in the gut with it's pipe organ soundtrack, the deep bass of the sound effects, the beauty of the shots, it's just a stunning film to witness. On third viewing in IMAX 70mm, there was even more discovery. I watched the film from a more objective position, nitpicking it apart, trying to find the holes/flaws people complained about, but I simply couldn't. People complain about this film because they're not interested in making an investment. They're only interested in stuffing their mouths with popcorn and shutting off their brains. With 2001: A Space Odyssey, there is a clear antagonist, it's a computer, something we've seen dozens of times. In interstellar, the antagonist is time itself, which is a hard concept to get through general audiences. We think three dimensionally and adding the fifth dimension of time, is something a lot of people are unwilling to think about. It's too bad for them because Interstellar is a brilliant film and worthy of further praise if only people understood it better.Christopher Nolan has never really been one of my favorite directors. His films have always been lacking in one way or another, little things that could have been better. For me Interstellar is not only his best movie so far, but it's a very 'adult' film. It's not about super hero's, it's not an action film with gun swinging or violence this film is thinking-man's adventure, for those who are willing to make the mental investment.",9,0,6,2 January 2015
American Sniper," Poor film about a serious subject
","American Sniper is suppose to be based on the Autobiography of former Navy Seal Chris Kyle and his life inside/outside the military. However, in reality the story is grossly inflated, making Chris Kyle out to be some amazing hero, where in reality he was just another cog in the wheel. Many key-pivotal aspects of the film were not part of his autobiography AND were based on his wife's memory, not actual facts written by the man himself. The screen writer Jason Hall, who has zero experience writing features, had only ONE phone call with Kyle before he sadly passed away. Many exciting and interesting aspects of Kyle's life weren't included in the screenplay. Crucially, the audience is incapable of connecting to any of the characters or feeling sympathy for the actions that take place. As a consequence, the emotional component has been left out entirely. Even the combat missions are boring at best, never leaving the audiences in any suspense. Worst part is, the film includes a fictitious and horribly conceived antagonist, as device to keep the audience in the story. Without it, there would be no story, the film would simply be too disjointed, more like a documentary miniseries, rather then a narrative feature film. The fictitious character adds the 'glue' necessary to keep us watching.Outside of the poor screenplay, technically the film was a train wreck. Much of the film is suppose to take place in Iraq yet it was shot in Southern California. For wide shot's, they had a second unit in Morocco doing some 2nd unit work, but every single Iraq scene was the same buildings used over and over again. The military vehicles, weapons, clothing and combat actions were all wrong as well, silly mistakes for such a big movie. In the finale, fake vehicles, helicopters and an absolutely atrocious sand storm, destroy whatever realism remained. There were other huge mistakes like using a fake baby in one scene and mannequins for wide shots! Yes you heard me correct, mannequin's were used in the backgrounds of wide shots and YOU COULD TELL thanks to the digital cinematography and projection. The film was actually boring to watch because it was visually uninspiring and flat. If the audience can't connect in any way to the characters, if the story is downright predictable and there isn't really any driving force, what keeps the audiences attention? Generally, stunning visuals and music can help a poor screenplay, but this film has neither a sore OR anything remotely redeeming about the cinematography. It was a truly 'flat' film with no dynamics in the audio mix, cinematography, screenplay or acting.Even though Bradley Cooper is an amazing guy and a great actor, his character wasn't strong enough to overcome the films glaring issues. It's just sad such a great 'American Hero' had his story butchered by one of the best filmmakers we have.",6,24,68,1 January 2015
Dunkirk," Why hasn't anyone else made a movie like this?
","There has never been anything like this made in the history of cinema. War movies can't really depict war because they always feel obligated to tell stories. Nolan threw the whole story thing out the window. It's literally one big action scene that lasts 1 hour and 40 some odd minutes. It's a brilliant idea because it really gives you the essence of war; it's relentless and it simply doesn't stop. Even the great war films like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Patton', have quiet moments in between the battles, but not Dunkirk. Quiet is a brief dialog scene where the actors try to figure out how the F to survive the next 10 seconds. Then the filmmakers tear down all the walls and watch as the characters try to survive the next few moments. To say it's intense is an understatement, your eyes are pegged to the screen, your senses are on high alert. You are in the spitfire as it attacks the German plane. You're in the ship as it's torpedoed and floods in real time. You're on the beach as it's bombed and peoples bodies fly into the sky. It's the best 3rd act to a war movie that I've ever seen, only... there aren't a 1st and 2nd act.So this is where I was SLIGHTLY disappointed. The movie focuses on the 'action' and doesn't let the audience soak it in. It also doesn't give you any emotional attachment to the characters or even the situation, you never 'feel' for anyone. Thus, it left me not really caring what I saw on screen. Like a video game, it just fed me constant stimulus until it was over, but I felt there could have been some moments to draw the audience into the people, rather then JUST the event as a whole. Even though some people didn't like Interstellar, (Nolan's last movie) I loved it because I could relate to the characters and there was an emotional thread I could cling onto. Even ten minutes of character development spread throughout the movie, would have been really good, but as I sit here writing this, having just seen it, I feel a lack of emotion that was very much present after watching Interstellar.With that said, what I saw was pretty damn awesome and technically it was so well made, I feel like the bar has been risen 3 levels. This maybe the last 'great' war film ever made. We may never see anything like this again because NOBODY will spend the time and effort it takes to get it all in camera, the right way. It worked so well in 70mm, it looked fantastic, it sounded awesome. The music was spot on and honestly slightly unmemorable because the movie moved so fast, it was hard to focus on any single thing. I was very much impressed with everything I saw and frankly, I think everyone should stop what they're doing and see Dunkirk in 70mm IMAX if they can find a theater near them. It's an experience that may never come around again and once it's gone from the theaters, your chance is over. Like so many great movies, this is one to be seen in the theater, the small screen will never do it justice.Score grade: A Score percentage 95%",9,5,13,20 July 2017
Jackie," 'Jackie' is far better then a normal bio pic.
","'Jackie' is far better then a normal bio pic. The story of Jackie Kennedy during the days after the presidents assassination, isn't exactly the kind of movie I'd normally be interested in. However, Natalie Portman playing Jackie Kennedy, french filmmaker Pablo Larraín and the stunning use of Super 16 to bring the audience back to 1963, were enough to peak my interest. 'Jackie' in of itself is a very simple story and from what I can tell, is completely true and told mostly in her own words. The filmmakers used many devices to tell the story, all of them pretty unique and interesting like the re-creation of old live broadcasts and the use of original 16mm footage from events around the capitol post assassination. The filmmakers did a brilliant job showing the confusion and depression that followed the assassination, making it realistic and heartfelt. Natalie Portman was outstanding in her (hopefully) Oscar-winning performance portraying Jackie. It's been years since I've seen someone play a person in history so well. Not only did she talk just like her, but she even looked like her. I was convinced from the first frame to the last frame, which is very impressive. Technically, the film was just brilliant. The use of S16 (retaining the formats 1.67:1 aspect ratio) was fantastic. The film wasn't very grainy/noisy, but it did look as if the film was underexposed slightly because it looked very flat, without a lot of dynamics. The filmmakers were obsessed with the 'single' shot during any dialog scenes. This technique helped them get right into the emotion of whoever was talking. I felt the lens choices were also spot-on, using a lot of the same focal length except for some well-placed zooms that worked so well. At one point, with the very unique score whaling in the background with a long zoom shot, 'Jackie' felt almost like a Kubrick film. The sparse score felt like something out of 'There Will be Blood' rather then a normal bio pic. This was to intensify the confusion and it worked very well, I just loved the score. As my analytical mind chewed on the film I noticed, there wasn't a single scene that felt out of place or unwanted, every frame was necessary to tell the story and the use of 'floating' time, helped keep it interesting. I was impressed the filmmakers re-created much of the White House on a soundstage somewhere in Europe, rather then use the sets here in the states. Most of the film was shot in France, which seems like an exorbitant expense, but I gather it was necessary for some reason, maybe due to financing. Filmmaking wise, 'Jackie' was a lesson in how to tell a very simple story without letting it bore the audience. It's a character study and unfortunately, it's about someone don't even know about. The film itself is about Jackie trying to make the American people remember John Kennedy and in a lot of ways, the film exists to remind people who Jackie was. I loved 'Jackie' and not because I'm some film snob, it's because the filmmaking within the movie was so well done. It's rare to see such GOOD filmmaking in main stream theatrical movies. Portman has two hands on the Golden Globe and Oscar for her role, nobody can touch her heartfelt and perfect performance. It's sad because there are so many great performances this year, but I think she's got it in the bag. 8.5/10 4 stars out of 5.",8,1,5,22 December 2016
Lincoln," Third grade history and a glamorous 1800's destroy Lincoln
","The 1860's were a dark time in American history, there wasn't anything light or happy about. Spielberg decided to make this movie light and happy, in both cinematography/set design, but also in the story. What is presented on screen is non-controversial story, yes it's the truth, but its omitting all of the gritty stuff which could make a movie like this actually interesting, instead of just a costume drama. Films like The Patriot, True Grit and Glory, do a far better job representing the time period then Spielberg's lavish, over the top production. By far the weakest element of Lincoln is the lack of darkness, the lack of realism in how the film was made. To Spielbergs credit, he is a fast worker, there is nobody in the industry today making big blockbusters anywhere near the speed he is doing it. However, on this film I wish he had slowed down a bit, I wish he had just taken more time to make sure the end product was more realistic. Its great to have a nice set, but if its over-lit, like we're watching a film shot in the 50's, it detracts heavily from the realism. Everything looks to modern in the film like it was made yesterday, even though SOME locations are actually real. They're too polished, everything is to good looking from the actors and costumes to the exterior locations and sets. Someone needed to dirty-up every single set, forcing Spielberg to realize that candles were the only light of the time. Again, because Spielberg works with the same crew day in and day out, all his movies look the same, no matter what time period they're shot in. To me, that is a huge detractor because dealing with the Civil War in Lincoln and World War 1 in War Horse, you'd think the world would be a bit darker and all that happy lighting and set design wouldn't exist. What's humorous to me is, Spielberg has made some dark movies, Saving Private Ryan and Schindler List being two of them. So what was stopping him from making Lincoln in the same way? Lincoln does have some saving graces; an awesome cast, a very well written script, its edited to perfection and of course Williams score is top notch. You get the impression by watching this film, there are going to be a lot of academy award nods in the acting department and of course a best picture nod because hey, its Spielberg right? Putting the lack of interesting history and glamorous 1800's aside, Lincoln is an entertaining movie and one has to admit, its well made. Leaving the theater I was disappointed because of what could have been. But it wasn't my movie and Spielberg's vision was clear, his 1800's are bright and glamorous, his Lincoln could do no wrong and the audience is sucked into that world for almost three hours, enjoying every moment of it.",7,13,35,10 November 2012
La La Land," 'La La Land' is the new 'standard' for fun in cinema.
","'La La Land' is the new 'standard' for fun in cinema. From the very opening number, 'La La Land' delivers a perfect mix of fantastic characters and excellent acting, mixed with vibrant musical numbers that hearken back to an era of filmmaking many people forgot about. 'La La Land' is aptly named because the filmmakers are clearly in love with Hollywood, not just in location, but also in the story itself, which revolves around 'making it' in the industry. So much of the story hit home, everyone in this industry has the struggles these characters go through and to me, that association made the story ever more entertaining. I must admit, I've never been a huge fan of musicals. However, the way 'La La Land' dealt with their music, worked very well. They didn't tell the story through singing, they told the story through music. If you think about it, that's the RIGHT way to make a musical because most people don't want to be sung to, but they will gladly hear a nice song that helps fill in a normal dialog scene. This film dives deep into music of various kinds and how people in the music industry are forced to do work they normally wouldn't do in order to fulfill their dreams. In a lot of ways, it's the sad reality of being in a more creative field these days and this film hit's a home run when it comes to telling the truth. Technically 'La La Land' is extremely proficient with a brilliant concept of dimming lights around actors to 'pause' certain moments and sing a song for instance. It's a great device that I haven't seen used in this fashion in a long time. The dance numbers were also shot with one flowing camera move, that made them much more exciting then the more classical fast cutting method. The amount of steadicam work is absolutely insane, it seems like every scene with someone moving was shot with steadicam. You could see the cuts between takes, where they did a digital splice between two takes in order to break long takes up, but it worked well. The film was shot on 35mm with anamorphic lenses (2.40:1 aspect ratio) and it looked pretty good. Very little noticeable grain, though it was for sure a 2k finish. I was a bit dismayed with some over- exposed scenes in harsh daylight, something that could have easily been fixed on set, but it was clearly unfixable in post or they would have fixed it. There were also some issues with focus pulling, but with film cameras and anamorphic lenses, it's really hard to judge focus on complex camera moves. Lighting wise, the film was proficient, but nothing crazy. Lots of big sources at night with a key of some kind. Lots of controlled 'set' lighting, which worked SOO well! I felt the set's were fantastic and so professionally done, those moments really stole the show lighting wise. The music/songs were catchy and some of the jazz numbers within the movie, were even better then the score. Of course, the actors sung and performed all of the songs on their own, including Ryan Gosling having to learn the piano from scratch in a few months of tutoring. Even John Legend has a role in the movie and does a great job, not only acting, but with writing a really nice track for the film. I loved how the film was edited (most likely written this way), which wasn't as chronological as most movies. There is even an epilogue, kind of a 4th act so to speak, that was absolutely brilliant and unexpected. That mixed with the editing style that held onto longer takes and single's vs the more standard 2 shot, it was just brilliantly made. There were moments where the filmmakers just stayed on a single, non-moving actor talking facing the camera, just looking to the right or left of the lens, for a good solid two minutes. The takes were EPIC and it worked so well thanks to the fantastic cast and I would assume, a lot of ad-lib. Over-all, I absolutely loved 'La La Land' in every way. Even though there were some technical snafus', and the big tap dance number could have been way better, I felt the movie over-all was extremely strong and VERY fun. You could tell the filmmakers were having fun making it and honestly, I was having a blast watching it. To me, more intelligent 'fun' movies like this, are what is lacking in Hollywood. It seems more and more, the studio films would rather be stupid and fun, rather then intelligent and fun. This is where 'La La Land' really changes the paradigm and is just one excellent ride! I don't say this much but I do believe this is the best 'general audience' movie I've seen in decades and for sure the best one this year by leaps and bounds.9/10 4.5 stars out of 5.",9,4,7,22 December 2016
Joker," One of the best essays on schizophrenia I've seen
","I can't help but thinking bout 'Joker'. This being the fourth day since watching, I can't seem to shake it from my memory. I wanted to write a review right away, but I also wanted to read feedback from others, to insure I wasn't missing anything. Turns out, I wasn't.Mental health is a subject I know quite a bit about but schizophrenia is something I haven't really experienced myself. There have been many films about the subject, however Todd Phillips masterpiece 'Joker', is probably the best mainstream take. I don't use that word 'masterpiece' lightly, it requires so many elements and in a cinematic quagmire 2019 has become, seeing a film like 'Joker' is a breath of fresh air. Yes, people haven't forgotten how to make a good movie.Now, I'm sure there is someone on here who was offended by 'Joker' and it's inhumanity, but that's kind of the point. Reality is, our protagonist is lacking the ability to reason properly and likewise, go a bit crazy from time to time in retaliation towards things which any rational human would also be upset by. It's just 'Joker', he just doesn't care anymore and armed with a snub nosed .45, he causes a bit of ruckus throughout New York, I mean Gotham. It's not because he was treated well, it's because he was lied to, manipulated and pushed around to the point of breaking.'Joker' for better or worse, has a paper thin story, but it doesn't matter. Our journey is with Joaquin Phoenix, one of the industries most talented actors and nearly every frame has part of him in it. This very intense relationship between himself and the audience, is quite astounding. Every frame is rich in detail, bringing a level of realism to the character that makes his reactions almost feel good. 'Joker' is a symptom of society and you almost HAVE to empathize with him, even though you know what he does is wrong. It's this internal struggle, which is the core of what makes this movie such a masterpiece.Phillips took a basic and important story about a struggle happening to so many people these days and push it into the DC universe, so that everyone would want to see it. The film and character stands alone without the makeup, without the name. However, including the name 'Joker' pushes it into another realm, with bigger financing and greater audience potential. It's those things that are the most clever aspects of this film. Otherwise, it would be another arthouse film like Joaquin Phoenix's phenomenal role in 'The Master', one of my all-time favorite movies. This movie plays perfectly as a stand alone without the 2 minute scene that locks it into the DC universe. To me, that's good storytelling and even though reviewers everywhere are panning the film because they feel it's too shallow and panders to the DC universe too much, I disagree. One of the reviewers sticking points is the filmmakers ability to negate the entire story by the end. It's as if the audience has schizophrenia and is seeing/believing things that never happened. By the end, you're wondering how much of what you saw actually happened and what was up to interpretation.The film was beautifully shot by a master cinematographer who initially was going to shoot on 35mm, but because Joaquin wanted to adlib much of the film in darkly lit locations, it was decided to shoot digitally for cost and time reasons. Warner agreed to make film prints however, as the Alexa 65's full-frame feel, translated really well to film. I was shocked how good the cinematography was, it looked and felt like an art piece. The editing, music and sound design were all spot on. There were so many technical challenges on the movie from huge scenes with thousands of extras in what appears to be downtown Manhattan, to a complete sub-story classic night time TV set that was used quite a lot. There were intense subway scenes that appear to be shot on the trains themselves. Heck, I only caught a few green screen effects in the movie, most of it was really shot on location. They had a great supporting cast from his mom to the TV show host played by Robert De Niro, both of whom did a great job. The 70mm print was excellent, not a single scratch or fleck of dirt and it always adds some depth to the film that the digital projection doesn't have.I guess the only gripe I have about the film, is the laziness surrounding some of the ancillary characters and the lack of humility. However, it's overlooked because that's how Joker views them anyway, so in the long run, it doesn't matter. The lack of humility is part of the character and sure it would have been nice for the violence to be toned down a bit, I don't think it detracted from the film at all. Many people are concerned the story will instigate copycat's, but I don't think so. Yes the violence and subplots are concerning for younger audiences, I just don't think anyone wants to be Joker. I don't think anyone will idolize him to the point of being a copycat.Honestly, I hope Phillips makes a Joker part 2, where he meets his nemesis Batman. Tell the Joker story from his point of view rather than Batmans. :)",8,1,2,9 October 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Murder on the Orient didn't need a remake.
","Kenneth Branagh is at it again, with a dialog-driven, murder mystery that in a lot of cases, didn't need to be re-made.As a railfan and 70mm buff, this was a movie I've been anxious to watch for quite sometime. Murder on the Orient Express is the very simple 'who done it' with the twist of a seemingly random journey that puts one of the best detectives in the world, in the heart of a crime only he can solve. The Agatha Christie story has been modified heavily for this new venture, the writers taking some of the best elements of her writing and adding some new twists and turns in hopes to revitalize the story. It's clear from the first scene, Branagh's intentions were to make an 'actor's' piece, rather than one of sheer entertainment. Where this film falls short is with it's characters, less it's casting choices. Unfortunately, whether due to time or financial constraints, even the most talkative characters feel very flat and missing important dynamics. Every time you want more from them, the filmmakers cut away. Every time the filmmakers show you more, it feels poorly written and doesn't make sense. I would make the assumption it was pretty long and it was substantially cut down. Furthermore, the lead character Hercule Poirot, has a heavy French accent and talks very fast. So much of the critical clever dialog can be missed with the blink of an eye. This is unfortunate because within the script, there are some good moments, it's just the translation from actor to audience, was weak. In terms of the production, this was a massive undertaking because they couldn't afford to shoot on location, so the entire movie was made on the back lot. This includes the grand station at the beginning, nearly all of the train scenes and of course, the mountain causeway which is where most the film takes place. There is 'some' real train footage in the movie, but only a few seconds here and there. Unfortunately as a consequence, there are a lot of visual effects shots. Mostly set extensions, but almost all of the wide shots of the train, is done in CG, which is unfortunate. Branagh only works on film and he felt this movie deserved the 'royal' treatment and would be entirely shot on 5 perf 65mm. He had worked with 65mm making 'Hamlet' and was excited to do it again. The cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, has worked with Branagh a few other times and was excited about working on large format. They shot most scenes with 2 cameras, and some of the bigger scenes that didn't have dialog, they used upwards of three cameras. This allowed them to shoot very fast and with a very experienced cast, it was easy to bang out scenes without much fuss or re- shooting. Since the film was being shot in the UK, they used Cinelab UK's 65mm processing machines and had overnight dailies, which was a perfectly acceptable workflow. The camera seems to be always in motion, either on a dolly, Steadicam or jib/crane. This created a really nice look, along with some excellent lighting choices from Zambarloukos. Instead of using green screen outside the windows of the moving train, VER provided the world's largest LED display solution for a movie. Zambarloukos shot plates in New Zealand on a rail line up in the mountains. They shot with both 65mm and digital cameras and wound up only using the digital media for those plates. With that said, the 65mm format was so crisp, you could tell the background was projected, which was a real shame. Had it been shot on anamorphic 35mm, you may not have been able to tell. I felt over-all cinematography wise, the film was made like a typical Hollywood venture. Outside of a few cool shots, like the Steadicam shot which goes through the entire train and shooting through some of the beautiful glasswork inside the coaches, there wasn't anything really outstanding to see. The production simply felt rushed and they weren't taking many risks, especially in the cinematography department. In summary, the production felt rushed, post felt rushed and even the printmaking and projection felt rushed. This left me semi-unsatisfied and at one point, I nearly dozed off because frankly, it just wasn't that interesting of a movie. There were a lot of great elements, but no glue to hold them together. Technically it wasn't anything to write home about either, which was disappointing. Even the score was very 2nd rate and lackluster, which was a real shame. There really wasn't any 'redeeming' value to the movie and that's the biggest problem. Worth the watch on home video, but now that the prints are about to be retracted, I wouldn't bother seeing on the big screen. Hopefully Fox makes some money off the prints and see's the value in perhaps striking more for future releases.",6,3,8,21 November 2017
