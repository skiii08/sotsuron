The Blair Witch Project," If you don't have Imagination and Patience..dont bother...
","To appreciate this film you have to let yourself be drawn in, you have to use your imagination.  If you can't do that and allow the film to worm its way into your mind, which it does masterfully--You wont get it.This is not a film where you will jump and be cat-scared, nobody is in a mask with a knife, this film is about REAL Fear, human terror.True horror builds up, it works its spell on you slowly...and it makes a lasting impression, which this film did...There are points in this film that do drag a bit, but the END is worth every damn minute...I was truly afraid for those three people, and I thought of them as people not actors who I was waiting to see have die.What a film!",Null,1,2,25 August 1999
