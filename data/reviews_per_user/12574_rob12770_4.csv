The Rock," This is a Bad, Bad,film...Avoid
","I could not believe that Nicholas cage would have participated in such a lame movie, let alone my fellow countryman Sean Connery, oh shame on you Sean..What troubles me most is the amount of good reviews this film has..Why? I could not bring myself to watch the last half hour of this film as I was feeling nauseous, Full of bravado and American heroism this film should be avoided at ALL costs..I love action movies, this has action, but that is all, every time you see a navy seal, this music starts to play throughout the entire film, grinding on your nerves, If you have seen this movie ,and liked it, please do not white any reviews on this site , as you could cost someone money, they might actually listen to you,then go out and buy the DVD, now THAT would be a waste of money.....",Null,0,6,30 November 2002
Minority Report," dont even THINK about doing the crime, you,ll get the time
","Ok so I,m a bit Biased as I realy like Tom Cruise, but this movie really gripped me, now I know who Philip .K. Dick is, what a great idea for a story, Im sure your familiar with it.definetly get this movie, it is shot via a blue filter of some kind and is slightly soft focus so projector users beware as its not as sharp as It could have been, but that dosent really detract from the story, GREAT FILM 10 OUT OF 10 !!",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," too clever for its own good
","OK, I'm a smart guy, BA Hons,.pc tech, but what the hell was this film about ?? OK, so it kind of comes together at the end..just..i love jim carry especially the truman show and the majestic.but blah bl;a of a mind thing was just too confusing, i sat through 90% of this with a confused look on my face , i was gonna turn it off a couple of times but i saw it through to the end..I'm sad that i don't like this movie enough to recommend it , but i cant, its just too bad. it does have the redeeming quality that its different from most movies, its kinda like ..vanilla sky or something mad like that,..oh and its not a comedy in case u where wondering. 3 out of 10 (for being different and good acting)",Null,0,2,5 November 2004
The Truman Show," finaly fantastic !
","I must admit , when i first saw this movie I was dissapointed, probably as i was expecting a jim carrey movie, funny and quirky, but the the subsiquent times i have watched this, has made it a firm favoroute of mine , definately in my top 10 movies of all time... and thats a BIG list belive me..why you might ask? well im not going to describe this movie or give away the plot, if you have never seen this, watch it and dont think of it as a jim carrey film, just think of it as a movie, have no expectations and you should be entertained, if not, wait a month or 2 then watch it again.. chances are you will watch it again and agin..well thats the way it happened for me, this movie (and The Majestic) proves that Jim carrey's repatios extands to more than just a funny madman, not thats theres anything wrong with that.",Null,0,0,18 July 2003
