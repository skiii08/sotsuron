The Blair Witch Project," what a piece of garbage!!
","I do not know what all the fuss is about. I seen this movie and its garbage.Critics have the gaulfull audacity to compare this to The Excorcist. Do these critics have their heads up their butts.I seen it at the Angelika Film Center on Houston/Mercer). The thing was sold out for 5 days straight, I had to sneak into the theatre.This was garbage. Have we as Americans become tolerant of garbage all of a sudden, This ain't  no Excorcist, This aint no Shining...this ain't sugar. Sixth Sense is the stuff though.As a fan of horror-since I'm 5 with The Shining, I was utterly disappointed with this heaping lump of dog-sugar.",Null,0,1,15 August 1999
"I Love You, Man"," I Love You Man! makes you laugh like a.....
","I am a huge fan of Paul Rudd, he is a fantastic comedic actor.I am also a fan of movies that make me laugh like a retard. I have a very loud laugh and some cats hate to go to the movies with me.I should be seeing this movie tonight at some point on Long Island. I have already begun using the phrase 'Mandate', like for example I was at the bank the other day and 2 tellers were planning on seeing 'Watchmen' again, I said to the 'so you guys are going to be going on a mandate?'. They seemed to get a kick out of it, because everything I do amuses them. Coincidentally Mandate was a gay magazine in the film 'My Own Private Idaho', In fact Keanu Reeves was on the cover-this is the sequence, where all the magazine covers are having a conversation in the adult bookstore.So check this out- River Phoenix's last film and definitely check out Paul Rudd in I love you man.",10,5,20,20 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," I was scared out of my damn mind!
","'28 Days Later' really freaked me out-the camera work and fast- edits was so profound.I thought it couldn't get any better-then I seen '28 Weeks Later' and was stunned at how scary that world had become.I was glued to the edge of my seat, from the beginning of the movie-the heart-palpitating horror didn't cease until the closing credits.The zombies have clearly taken over...from what I seen in this hellish world there was plenty of fertile ground left for '28 Months Later' and '28 Years Later'. I was blown away with the make-up and special visual effects-there were so many people involved with getting this film so right and so scary- I counted almost a thousand people in the credits on effects alone.",10,2,5,12 May 2007
The Shining," A classic of bloodshed
","When I was 5 years old Stanley Kubrick gave me the gift of cinema , This masterpiece of Stephen King-esque gore The Shining.I can still vividly recall the day my mother took me to a  Times Square movie theatre for a revival showing of Mary Poppins.On the walk home I saw the title The Shining on a marquis and had to have my mother take me in to see this film,my first horror movie.It was with this movie that I became hooked on the gore and bloodshed being projected onto mammoth screens in my local theatre.Since that time I have seen several other horror films and none of them compare to this classic. Stanley Kubrick has masterfully rewritten this King novel of terror at a desolate hotel into a classic film which can be a hellish version of ,Capra's 'Its A wonderful Life'",Null,0,0,26 November 1998
Iron Man," Does Nick Fury look like a ------!
",OMG...This movie had it all. The Effects. The Plot. The Action. The predictable cameo from Stan Lee (look for it).Note to self:cameos are cool and I should be in all of my films.What else can I say about a film that has raked in 200 Million over the last 5 days (according to the radio station that I showered to this morning) and thats darn impressive! I remember getting a text message saying stay till after the credits and I am happy I did and for those who are probably reading this-you know why. Robert Downey Jr.-No relation to Morton Downey Jr. has really delivered as opposed to Mr. Pacino (in 88 Minutes). His Stark is believable-Jeff Bridge's character is also believable.,10,1,4,6 May 2008
The Sixth Sense," An interesting plot twist
",This movie rocks check out the plot twist. It will have you examining your religious beliefs. You will also find this film interrupting your sleep pattern. Bruce Willis has come a long way from Die Hard.,Null,0,0,15 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," This ain't no Blair Witch..this is good stuff
",This movie has disturbed my sleeping pattern. I am scared to walk around my house alone. If I was 5 I'd have nightmares from this quality piece of cinema.I don't remember in recent times being so scared then seeing this film with my mom at the Sunnyside Center. This movie made me scream a couple of times. That rose-bathrobe lady 'No dinner isn't ready Stanley...Youre a bad husband Stanley' was the first to make me jump. Then that vomiting little girl almost sent me over the seat into the next row. 'I'm feeling much better'.The kid with the hole in the back of his head was chilling as well.'Comeon I'll show you where my dad keeps his gun'.The Sixth Sense is a worthy comparison to The Excorsist and The Shining. This is the first Bruce Willis vehicle to give me nightmares. In fact this is the first movie to give me nightmares since I was 10...15 years ago.,Null,0,0,15 August 1999
