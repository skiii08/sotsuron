Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not bad... but...
","Everyone speaks of it... everyone loves it...I had huge expectations for the movie, but I was a little bit disappointed after it. The movie was a documentary, but then there was added a very bad storyline considering about the P.... An.... Some of the jokes also went too far, and I have to admit that I felt from time to time to be forced to laugh.I've heard that many parts of the film were 'real life situations' and I wanted to believe that for the most of the time. But finally the Naked 69 thing and running thru the congress room crushed my borat-world. It was a very good idea to make a Such documentary movie, but with an extra pee poo humor I sometimes felt like an elementary school kid when laughing to that. A funny film, but maybe a little irritating too.",5,3,7,26 November 2006
