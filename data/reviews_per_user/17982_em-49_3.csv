Raiders of the Lost Ark," one of the best
","This was one of the best movies. I absolutely loved it. Who could forget the scene where Indiana Jones is facing the samurai warrior, a seemingly unbeatable opponent with all his fancy sword tricks, and Indy casually pulls out his gun and shoots him. And if you don't think that's funny, when he attempts the same thing a second time later in the movie only to find out he has no gun, you should at least crack a smile. If you don't...you're hopeless. This movie was hilarious and if you haven't seen it you should.",8,2,4,9 August 2000
Seven Years in Tibet," A + film...
","This was an absolutely amazing movie. It was well-directed and beautifully filmed. This movie invokes all the viewers emotions with scenes of sadness, passion, humour and compassion. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and so did everyone i know.....the film is 3 hrs in length but it passes quickly. I hope you'll take the time to see this epic tale.",9,3,5,4 August 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," breath-taking
",The Shawshank Redemption was a beautifully directed movie. The actors portrayed their characters to the greatest extent and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The best scene in the movie was the huge tree...each of its branches catching the suns rays as Morgan Freeman finds what Tim Robbins left for him...anyone who doesn't remember that better watch the movie again.,10,0,0,5 August 2000
