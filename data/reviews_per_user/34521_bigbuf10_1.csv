Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lose Jar-Jar
","I thought that this movie was an overall success, but also somewhat of a disappointment. I think it could have been better had Jar-Jar been less of a childish character. Also, the whole 'Anakin in Space' sequence was a bit far-fetched and stupid. Although these parts were a bit sub-par, I thought the special effects were great and the fight scenes were awesome. Two thumbs up for George Lucas, and hopefully Episode Two will be even better.",9,0,0,21 June 1999
