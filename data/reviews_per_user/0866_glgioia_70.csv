The Blair Witch Project," 2 Words - Cell Phone!!
","Just kidding, its hard to believe this movie is only 3 years old...seems like I've been watching it for much longer. Regardless, the film takes place back in the dark ages of 1994, when cell phones weren't as yet handed out to all citizens at birth. I've seen this movie many many times, and it still chills me. Its become the 'Its a Wonderful Life' of the Halloween season. It expertly exploits the lingering childhood fears of the woods after dark, and the haunted abandoned house. Once again if you keep the supernatural question unanswered, (pay attention Hollywood), it is still possible to scare the fertilizer out of audiences. Film makers are usually just not willing to work that hard. This film has no sex or violence, and only the smallest tiniest dollop of gore. Yet it smokes any movie for fright thats been made in the last 20 years. The performances and writing are brilliantly natural and completely believable, and pose an interesting sociological study on group behavior in crisis. The 'I would have done this', and 'they are stupid, why didn't they just'...thoughts and debates are what makes the film a masterpiece. Horror films about the woods have been made before, but sadly rarely make use of the woods per se, as the cuplrit of fear. Pity, that fear is deep in our psyche, stamped in our makeup, and if you cleverly storytell, a nut with a hockey mask and chainsaw are hardly required to bring it to the surface.",9,1,2,29 October 2002
Scarface," Jimmy Carter's Favorite Film
","Vintage, vintage, quintessential all that other jazz to describe the 1980s is captured in this one motion picture that chronicles the life of a Cuban refugee and his rise to power as a drug lord. Do you realize this film was nearly rated X because of the violence? My how times have changed. This is nothing now. Decency, of course was outlawed sometimes in the early 90s, as any child will tell you. So Scarface today when viewed leaves only the mildest impression in terms of its violence. You are more apt to be disturbed by the already outdated musical score, and sadly pretentious clothing that characterized the era. But you gotta love it. For all its many faults, I think it's really a landmark. You can sort movies pre and post Scarface rather neatly, as the doors sort of came off in Hollywood around the same time. As for the micro evaluation? It's good there too. Stone and DePalma working extremely well together, and Pacino and the supporters giving over the top yet still believable performances. It's an interesting thing to watch this 20-year-old film and see how so very much; the country and times we live in have been changed, or perhaps mutilated is a better word, by our wonderful elected officials",Null,0,1,11 December 2003
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Archie Bunker meets Latka Gravis
","I sit and watch this film laughing my ash off because it is so damn funny. It really is that. There are parts that are completely hilarious and qualify as some of the funniest moments I've ever had in a movie theater. But then as I head home, I stop and try and figure out why even that rarest of breeds, the entertaining new Hollywood film, leaves me wishing I hadn't enjoyed it so much. Borat, the absurd but hilarious tale of a bigoted chauvinist Kazakh immigrant's quest to marry Pamela Anderson while filming a discover-America documentary for his homeland, triumphs at the box office, and earns the raves of critics across the board. This in a society which has recently added diversity to the noble virtues of truth, justice, freedom, equality etc. But...this is now also a society where double standards of acceptability have become the norm when observing race relations. One group can at the expense of another make merry, where another group most certainly cannot. Herein lies Borat'a winning secret. For Borat perfectly demonstrates and even perfects this weird phenomenon of inequity and does it so well that at first glance, it's hypocrisy is virtually transparent. Borat's Archie Bunker like prejudices seem to be aimed at all creeds equally, and in fact, for Borat the character, it holds true. Yet, look closer and you see that this is not so for Borat the movie. The film is by no means innocent of prejudice any more than its main character is, as we see the same tired modern stereotypes lurking not particularly far beneath an 'everyone is fair game' veneer. The same groups we have become accustomed and even inured to see lampooned and actually insulted get their usual treatment in this film. While with equal predictability, other groups are elevated from misunderstood victims of prejudice straight up to goodness personified, which by this movie's standards is tantamount to beatification. Borat makes it quite clear that for whatever the reasons, racial and ethnic jokes can still be surefire laugh-getters even in todays politically airtight environment provided that said jokes are delivered by an ignoramus and also and more importantly provided that in the end, the 'right' people get the last laugh. Disagree? Why not ask Seinfeld instant has-been Mike 'Kramer' Richards, who's very own Borat impersonation and subsequent circus/apology/coup de grace public execution, was Hollywood's politically insane and all too expectedly difficult to digest contribution to the American Thanksgiving table this year. Yet the million dollar question remains; Just who exactly has the right of decision in this magnificent quandary we've built for ourselves? My guess is Kazakhstan for starters isn't afforded much chance for input.... Is Borat as funny as you are hearing? Yes and maybe more so. And that's what bothers me so much I suppose.",7,0,3,19 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode I - Affirmative Action
","Took me 5 years to eventually get around to see this. Only serendipitously too, as I sauntered down Lexington Ave, trying to kill time before a rendezvous, I happened upon a seedy antique/junk store. There covered with dust, hidden amongst forgotten B classics, and gay porn, I found this movie. My time had finally come. I shelled out the 5 bux, and threw it in my bag. Verdict: I liked it. One thing I had never been able to get out of people was just how good is it compared to its predecessors. My opinion, its in the same ballpark, somewhere between the first two and the weaker Return of the Jedi. The storyline is very simple, and the dialogue none too clever, but all in all it works and seems a fitting introduction to the saga the entire world knows so well. The obligatory 'chariot race' action sequence, as well as the obligatory 'duel to the death', both are imaginative, new and expertly delivered. One thing negative; where the first two movies raised interesting questions and puzzles, and left you hungry for answers, this movie is all answers. Almost as if Lucas feels he is running out of time, and that the remaining installments won't be sufficient to reveal all he has to tell. In that, it's sort of hokey. I don't think we, as viewers really needed this. Example: C3PO was assembled as a sort of toy in Darth Vader's youth? All I can say is we better see what happened to his memory banks that erased all recollection of that, and his time on the planet he returns to in the original Star Wars. As for my one line summary? What are we to think? That since there are virtually no African Americans in Star Wars, which takes place AFTER this, that only Billy Dee Williams survived into future generations? It's kind of silly. JaJa Binx got bad press. He's actually got some funny moments. One thing, I know this was made in the mid 90s, but the scene at the Republican senate was eerily similar to what is taking place in the UN today. The democratically elected Queen's planet has obviously been invaded, but the terrorist invading force is able to manipulate an impotent bureacracy, and filibuster condemnation and action, by ordering a frivoulus full-scale investigation. Yup, Lucas is still a genius.",Null,2,7,7 March 2003
The Ring," Effective
","Journalist stumbles upon a creepy video tape that she believes is killing all who watch it.There are clearly two types of people in the world. Those who find stuff like this scary, and those who do not. Its quite reminiscent of Stir of Echoes, and follows the same basic storyline with a few twists. I havent read the Japanese novel upon this was based. What I have read, however, is tons of stuff by the Victorian horror master MR James. He has a tale called the Mezzotint, about a man who buys an engraving and watches in horror as a diabolical event is slowly reenacted on the engraving. The images shown on the video in this film, and the overall mood I found to be quite evocotive of that particular tale, and nearly as effective. The film does a wonderful job of producing the kind of images that are only otherwise found in nightmares. Whether the resolution and explanation of the how and why will satisfy you is another story. I thought it could have been better. But that is not to say I wasnt totally creeped by it, and that I'm not still. It will most certainly have you hearing each and every creak in your abode as you sit late at night in the dark while this plays. Naomi Watts, my fav!",Null,0,0,18 December 2003
Casablanca," What a waste of time...
","Just kidding. As far as pure Hollywood production goes, (top stars, director, screenwriting, subject matter) it is probably the best film I've ever seen. Lines from the movie are quoted as often as Shakespeare, and I would lay odds that literally each and every successful subsequent film maker has made a careful study of this work. I envy anyone who hasn't seen it for the first time. You'll only have that pleasure once in your life.",10,0,0,6 January 2003
Minority Report," Sabbatical Time
","Spielberg doesn't write these things, but if your going to give him credit for the winners you got to hammer him for the duds. Another disappointing effort that literally drowns itself in cliché. There is nothing original in the plot, and worse, in the special effects which actually seemed to be done on the cheap. Didn't I see the same gravity cars in Star Wars? The concept is provocative, but nothing is done with it. It very quickly turns into Witness meets The Fugitive meets Blade Runner. You know who the bad guys are; we've seen it all done so many times before. One gets the feeling that Spielberg sees himself as the successor to Kubrick, as he attempts to play with the lighting in a vain attempt to dazzle you with image. He can't pull it off, and really shouldn't try to. A.I. redeemed itself with the final half hour of footage. This film had no such redemption in fact the resolution is the most overdone clichéd part of it all. Cruise, on the other hand, continues to solidify himself as the industry's top leading man with another great action performance, but it aint enough to rescue this.",Null,0,0,28 January 2004
Training Day," Colors II
","A seasoned narcotics officer takes a rookie out for one day of on the job training to determine if he's worthy of joining the elite undercover department. Is LA really this big of a mess? This movie makes Capone's Chicago look like Bedford Falls. But don't believe it. Thanks to your friendly neighborhood Liberal Thought Police media correspondent, a big city cop can't so much as clean his gun without being brought up on misconduct or excessive force charges. So the idea of Los Angeles being a modern day Dodge City with the cops shooting and beating up the street scum is about as far from reality as a Bill Clinton testimony. This is one of those films that is at times so over the top brilliant, and at others so patheticaly stupid, that you wonder if it wasnt a splicing of efforts by 2 different directors. But its all one guys work, and sadly the stupidity leaves a stronger aftertaste than the quality. Whats good is the entire first hour and Denzel's and Hawke's work throughout. Whats bad is the typical, utterly unoriginal and predictable ending. How can one movie go from so fresh to so moldy stale within the short span of two movie hours? Figure that one out and the world is your oyster.",4,2,14,28 October 2002
Memento," Better and Better
","A man who has lost forever his ability to make new memories, seeks the killers of his wife.Brilliant, it just doesn't get old. I don't usually go in for gimmicks, because they are usually retreads of a previous gimmick. But I don't think anyone ever tried making a film like this before. How do you let the audience share in the main dude's memory afflition? Well its simple, do what Nolan did. I think to spell it out takes away if you have never seen it. But on a dry run, you will be knocked over. Movies just so rarely can be seen as a singular experience anymore. I think this film more than deserves the unending praise it receives. Pearce was born to play Leonard, and Pantoliano does what he was born to do, play the rat you kind of like, but mostly hate. See, this is why the Oscars to me are such a bad joke. This was by far the best picture of 2000, and probably the best picture since. But they never see fit to reward a film for any of the right reasons. And they don't seem to be heading in that direction.",8,0,2,5 October 2003
Two for the Money," Underwritten and Overacted
","The rise, fall and ultimate salvation of a former college athlete extraordinaire, turned odds picking genius and his megalomaniac mentor. Your basic C+.Stylish but vapid effort that leaves you for the most part, unsatisfied and somewhat confused. The clichés are in abundance, and the plot alternates between good and dumb like a little kid playing with a light switch. Predictably, in the end it all falls back to earth with a resounding Holloywood ending thud. Pacino and McCon handle some cartoonish material admirably well, but their characters, like the overall story, are just completely unreal and thoroughly unlikeable. To this mix we toss in Exec. Producer Renee Russo, who gives a credible yet superfluous performance playing the faithful former junkie wife. Sigh. Its difficult not to compare this film to Devils Advocate, as Pacino is basically handed and relives the exact same role complete with generous helpings of blasphemy-rich, meant to make you squirm F dialog. An idiotic sequence where Pacino coaches goody 2 shoes McCon on incorporating the F word into his vocabulary, ends up with the latter using it in a telephone conversation later with his mother...she was calling him about some major family crisis that believe it or not, is never fully revealed to us and is in no way resolved. Shall I talk of the Gamblers Anonymous meeting where Pacino hands out business cards looking for new customers for his 1 900 operation? The situations, arcs and overall template are near carbon copy of Devils Adv., but as you can see nowhere near as plausible, which is a laugh considering Devils Advocate deals with the supernatural. (alas no naked Charlize this time either.) To be fair, major shortcomings and annoyances thrust aside, I grudgingly admit this movie somehow manages to entertain. I credit that more, however, to the subject matter. If you have any sort of interest in gambling, and who doesn't, there is a decided thrill in watching someone ride the roller coaster vicariously. Silly and banal though it may be, 2 For The Money still manages to scratch that gambler euphoria itch.",4,0,1,11 May 2006
12 Monkeys," Spot On
","I need to get a good copy of this, because I taped it off of bloody digital cable and the movie looks like a dark impressionist painting half the time. But this film is a definite keeper. We've been peppered with these altered reality movies of late, and most of them stink, and all for the same reason. They set out to confuse the hell out of us, which is ok by itself. I think most people still love a good mystery, and are usually up for a mental challenge when giving a movie a try. The problem usually is in the revelation. Which if it makes sense, i.e. Vanilla Sky, is usually a major letdown because of its triteness. Or in the cases of Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive, the moviemaker never intended to answer your questions fully in the first place. 12 Monkeys kinda puts it all together in that its mentally stimulating in its buildup, and then goes on to reward us with a well thought out resolution of the events, that loses none of the imagination and I guess sheer horror. Time travel to the past we know is impossible, so that even a yeoman's effort like this still has its annoyances in the loopholes of logic that simply have to be accepted. But you can get past them here, and the story keeps you totally tuned in. Gilliam almost seemed to learn from the mistakes of Brazil, and just tweak it a bit to bring it more down to earth. That's all he needed apparently.",8,0,0,19 March 2003
Spice World," Worth a Watch to Judge for Yourself
","What were you expecting? Pride and Prejudice it aint.Its not the Spice Girls people hate, it's the idea of the Spice Girls. Most people who say they hate them or try to commit you to an institution if you say you like them, probably have never given the music a serious listen, and certainly never watched this movie. I'm a huge fan of the Beatles, so I found it quite easy to get sucked into the Spice phenomenon, and must say that everyone I've turned onto their music begrudgingly though it may be, admits they cant help liking it. As far as the film, again think of A Hard Days Night. Completely plot less, just a vehicle to hear the music and see the larger than life performers on the big screen. Ahh, but it was a slick well made film wasn't it and the charisma of the stars did in fact carry it over the goal line. So it can also be said, constant reader, of Spice World. Take my advice and rent it, if you feel you must you can always do so under a phony name.",Null,1,2,23 August 2003
The Others," M.R. James, Finally Done Justice in Film
","Excellent ghost story set at the close of the Second World War about a widowed mother, and her 2 children living on a huge, classically creepy estate. Things begin to go astray when a mysterious trio of servants moves in. Wow, pleasantly surprised at the reaction on the board to this, I expected people to hate it. Thought I was one of the few who still appreciated gothic horror. Of the spawn of The Sixth Sense, you have the abysmal Dragonfly on the one end, this, The Others, at the opposite. Might even be better than The Sixth Sense for sheer creepiness. It lacks the gore, and obsequious visual shock of TSS, but more so than TSS, sticks to the original game plan; to frighten us. I have found, the fright element in TSS by the end of the film is all but beaten out of it, as it becomes more of a human drama piece. Not so here. The Others is a more narrow ranged, and I mean that positively, exercise in good old-fashioned atmospheric horror. It builds slowly and brings you closer and closer to a very effective, and frightening climax. It relies heavily upon scenery, weather, lighting, costume...all of the old forgotten tools. Most if not all of the fear is implied, and left for your imagination to fill in the blanks. I like that. This honestly could have been rated G, and the only reason, I'm sure it wasn't simply an attempt to spare it doom at the box office, is that film is just too frightening for kids. Highly recommended.",Null,1,2,13 March 2003
Ed Wood," Pull The String!!!!
","Offbeat biography about the eccentric director Ed Wood, notable for giving us what is considered to be the worst film ever made, Plan 9 From Outer Space. If Johnny Depp doesn't win this Oscar, its time for someone else to start up an awards show. Brilliant performance by the kid. Burton too, just completely outdoes himself. So does Landau for that matter, he at least was recognized with an Oscar. But the film should have been showered with them. It's a masterpiece. Shot in black and white, its atmosphere nails postwar Hollywood, in the final days when movies still had no need for ratings. The irony is Ed Wood in his lifetime, never amounted to anything. His films were beyond horrible to the point of just being unwatchable. Subject matter that's just hard to even comprehend.  I can't begin to describe the awfulness of them; it's worth renting one just for the history aspect.  That said, in his own way he was a pioneer. Directors especially the likes of Tim Burton owe a little something to this guy and his work if only for expanding the boundaries of conventionality. And this film is tenderly handled to give some respect to a guy who never saw any in his lifetime. One of recent Hollywood's better achievements.",Null,0,0,18 January 2003
A Bridge Too Far," A Film Too Long
","Too muddled and confusing as well. One of Montgomery's foolhardy grabs at glory that cost a lot of lives. After Normandy, the Allies attempt to catch the Germans by surprise by dropping behind enemy lines roughly 40,000 troops. But violating one of the first rules of warfare, they implemented the operation much too quickly and with insufficient forethought to the possible complications. Had DDay been so poorly planned, we'd all be wearing lederhosen und humming Wagner. Good ole Monty! Regarding the movie, it ironically imitates most of the miscues of the military operation that it depicts. The ideas are good, but the scope of the project was just way too large to coherently squeeze into a near 3 hour film and the disjointed multiple story lines end up zapping most of your interest in the outcome. But...I don't know if you will ever see a cast like this assembled again. Check out the names, wheeeeew! Yes, they are all outstanding and no, none of them are simply cheesy cameos like cheesy Ted Danson in Private Ryan. Special mention should be given to Hopkins performance.",Null,1,2,10 August 2003
Sleepy Hollow," Swung on and Missed!
","Aren't there movie doctors out there? Is that what an editor is supposed to do. But maybe guys like Burton are so revered that the studios can't do even the slightest fine tuning on their projects. This film just needed another set of eyes and it might have been great. But what starts out as a marvelous premise gets quickly lost in a not so scary storyline that has to resort to heavy duty gore to keep you from becoming Rip Van Winkle. Depp is great as always, as the meek but courageous police inspector Ichabod Crane who is sent upstate to investigate a series of bizarre murders. I really don't have a problem with mutating the classic tale in this case, as I said, it really looked promising. Burton serves up a wonderful feast for the eyes as far as set recreation, and mood photography. He goes for the dark look, if you can believe it. Almost every exterior shot is done in shadowy steel blues, grays and snow. So much for the Halloween angle. It doesnt snow aroud here until Thanksgiving. But again its not the typical Burton Hades cinematography, but the really dopey story which if it must be original, has to be better. I think a guy with Burtons vision would have been best off just making a Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and putting his signature stamp on it visually. His signature stamp storyline is more often than not, pretty forgetable and hardly an improvement on a literary legends work. Keep it simple Tim and people might stop laughing at you. Look for Christopher Walken as the maniacal Headless Horseman.",Null,0,1,6 November 2003
Gettysburg," Gets Better Each Time
","Utterly superb dramatization of the turning point battle of the Civil War. A clash so enormous in scale that whoever won, was destined to win the war. Brilliantly directed and screenwritten with top notch moving performances by all. Almost makes you understand why so many people are into those reenactment things. I think to fully appreciate the more intelligent war films, you almost have to know the battle in detail going in. The movie uses dialogue to try and explain whats happening, but its extremely hard to conceptualize without the aid of graphics. I'm not saying you won't enjoy this film without a firm grasp of the battle details, only that you will enjoy it much more if you are able to do a little reading beforehand. Either way, see it. I am truly amazed by the depth of feeling all these guys were able to put into this project. Daniels and Berenger, in particular, give Oscar caliber performances. A total home run.",10,80,88,2 November 2003
Closer," He who laughs last
","The chronicle of an overlapping pair of relationships done up in raw 21st century life-is-pointlessism.Loved it until the final scenes, when it all stopped being in any sense of the word believable, and even resorted to done before cheap gimmickry? The rest however is rather good, and the acting by all four principle characters is to a person, first rate. Another problem I have is, I don't associate Natalie Portman with the 'rare uncultivated beauty' we're supposed to believe she is, quite the opposite actually. While I realize that is purely a matter of taste, I am sure I am not alone in believing her part was terribly miscast. The dialog is provocative, and definitely cuts to the quick on a lot of issues, but more importantly keeps you watching. But I wouldn't go overboard with the praise heaping on this film, because in the end its main tool is shock through brutality, crassness and vulgar lower the bar even more pillow talk. It is startlingly intelligent and even fresh, yet I don't care how its dressed up, or who the director is, the film is not dark as everybody labels it, but base. I don't know of any enduring literature or art that is patently vulgar, think about it.",6,4,5,6 July 2005

A fascinating study in alienation and solitude induced madness, the irony of the countless lonely walking silently amidst the multitudes. The heavy subject matter delivered in the shape of an innovatively shot film, with extreme real dialogue, common place now, but out of the everywhere in 1976.

Forrest Gump," 'Why don't you love me, Jenny?'
","What will make this film endure is its apolitical skew when commenting on major political events. Everyone is parodied, everyone's hypocrisy revealed through Forest's simplicity, including the peaceniks - which is a welcome change to say the least. I truly believe this is one of the better films of the last quarter century. The reliance on special effects unfortunately will weaken this film over time, that's just inevitable. When you watch it now, the insertion of Forest into a number of historical events, which is a huge part of the film, already show an antiquated technology. While this was a new thing and sold the movie when it was released, it's more of a distraction now. There are roughly ten major scenarios or chapters in Forest's life that the film chronicles. Each completely as unrelated as can be imagined, but they are all done so well and woven together so finely, that never once is continuity threatened. The fifteen minutes or so of Viet Nam is as good as that gets. The photography goes heavy on the earth's natural beauty, and seeks to subliminally remind us how meaningless are all of the seemingly crucial events that pop off while we live our lives. Forest's inferior intellect allows him, although sadly unrealistically, to seek and win simple love, gain serendipitous fame and fortune, and ultimately attain nirvana because he is not burdened by intellectual fear or cerebral reasoning. Really makes you stop and think about what is important in this life we are blessed with.",Null,1,3,15 January 2003

","One of those films that really don't improve too much on the trailer that advertised it. But its a better than average spy pic taken from the Ludlum novel, which I never read but something tells me wasn't much like this film. Damon is convincing as the beleaguered amnesiac Bourne, and Franka as always loveable, playing here a Euro trash drifter/love interest. High tech, gizmos galore, and lots of those impressive movie CIA can't miss assassins. True to life? hmmmm, aren't there 2 notorious targets running around in Iraq and Afghanistan that we supposedly have marked for dead? Maybe Hollywood should send some men out there.

Cast Away," Wilson!!!!!!!
","Magnificent Robinson Crusoe adventure vehicle that is unfortunately sandwiched between a vapid love story. I realize that the movie would probably not work without the home elements, but they are just way too long and way too ordinary. The setup wastes over 30 minutes of film, that I really would rather have been spent on further exploring the difficulties of survival on the island. That part, the best part flies by way too quickly. But what can you do? It's still very watchable, and the good part is it's the perfect pay channel movie. Why? Odds are you'll be flipping through the channels and happen upon this en medias res, which means you'll have skipped at least part of the boring beginning and if your lucky jump right in during the incredible plane crash sequence.

The Village," Slooooooooooooow
","But not bad all in all. The story of an Amish style society, told with the directors usual assortment of sight frights and skin crawlers. These mostly concern the creatures that terrorize the village by night. They are definitely scary, modeled almost exactly like the devil's henchmen in Time Bandits, those tall cloaked creatures with the cows skull heads and hook hands if you have any idea at all what I'm talking about. Gilliam was definitely onto something, because as goofy as they sound, for some reason they scare the crap out of you. Shamalyan has a gift for getting the absolute scary most in a situation, and in this film he exercises the talent generously. Here's the trouble, if you find the fright ineffective, I can almost guarantee you will hate this film, because not a whole lot else happens in it. There isn't a plot as such, its more of an examination on the way of life and the attendant troubles of a closed off society. The trouble of the creatures becomes the overriding drama, and the Twilight Zone style resolution isn't bad. Its not great however, and there's unquestionably too much ineffective dead time. Fans of this director will no doubt overlook the shortcomings and repeated themes, and enjoy one of his scarier efforts. For the average guy on the street, it might not satisfy.",6,1,3,12 January 2005
Doctor Zhivago," Doesnt Cut The Mustard
","One of the few 'huge' films of my parents generation that just doesnt do it for me. There's a cog missing in the machine, which i cant quite isolate. The performances are incredible, and the scenery costumes and cinematography, forget about it. Maybe its just the story is too whacky, and it just doesnt compute. Could be a culture mishap? Could be a poor adaptation of what might have been a great book? Cant say. But you just dont really give a darn about any of it. Julie Christie is gorgeous, and you should want to feel the need to save and protect her like Zhivago seeks to, but you dont. Almost like you dont get the chance, because the film takes another crazy turn just as you start getting into the setup. Its overload too with the entire mess of the Soviet Revolution and the havoc it rained down on all of those poor people. But even that is skimmed, and is more of a distraction, a competitor to the storyline. Again, its not a disaster, but you will be hard pressed to have considered the 4 hours or whatever it is, as time well spent. Too bad. Bolt and Lean, even they were human.",Null,2,5,25 September 2002

Every time I go to Europe I invariably find myself in one of the many Holocaust museums scattered throughout the continent. And every time I do, my holiday mood is always instantly erased. I become filled with an overwhelming urge to smack the next local who dares look at me askance. This uncontrollable reflex certainty that all the people around me had a part in atrocities of Naziism just completely takes over. It's ridiculous, but I can't help it. If you can't get to Europe, see this film. It does an absolutely masterful job of exploring the question of universal culpability, not only by Europeans, but by people everywhere. Techincially the film is flawless, the acting must be seen, no justice can be given to it here.

","Superior to the 60s Sinatra original with a great cast and fantastic direction.Clooney as usual is an ass, but the film is really really good. Julia Roberts is stunningly pretty, in the face. Shots of her walking however have got to be edited out. These are just petty annoyances, and the idea that a time synchronized chain of events could ever be pulled off is laughable, but its so much fun to watch. Why does Cheadle use that horrible English accent and why isnt he credited? Why is Brad Pitt eating or drinking something in every scene? Matt Damon steals every scene he is in. Film does a nice job of giving you a feel for the modern Vegas.",8,0,1,28 October 2003
Seabiscuit," Down the stretch they come!!!
","Wonderful dramatization of the legendary horse, and the people who surrounded it. Intersting in its study of the owner, trainer and jockey and how the collection of unfortunate mavericks were almost mystically drawn to a troubled horse, like pieces in a puzzle. Sporadic naration by author David McCullough which deals mainly with US handling of the Great Depression adds a nice historical element to the film. Its a nice marriage of film and documentary, and unique in its compostion as such. The director paced the film much like a good horse race, with the stretch run of the film's final twenty minutes, the most surprising and satsifying of the entire effort. I have to admit, I never saw it coming. A must see!!!",Null,0,0,28 January 2004
JFK," Warning contains *Common Sense*
","'Kevin Costner, in the role he was born to play...and play and play'Lesson One people, if Ed Asner is in a movie, and a political one at that, Hollywood is giving you are rare glimpse behind its usual smoke and mirrors psyche job.Lesson Two; you can accurately date any film within 3 years, if you note Laurie Metcalf in a role of prominence.Lesson Three; Kevin Costner shops at a specialty big man's hat boutique.
Lesson Four; Oliver Stone's straightjacket size is a 44 Short.This movie reminds me of one of my Dad's favorite lines about how you can dress a monkey in a tuxedo, and he'll still crap himself. Film is a slick high budget tuxedo clothing an insipid childish and groundless conspiracy theory. Good cast, great acting, little else. Why aren't there any good conservative filmmakers, or how about an entire industry to balance the Lefty interpretations of history. As Ed Harris's imaginary character says in `A Beautiful Mind', one thing we should all remember is that while McCarthy may have lost his marbles in exposing Communists in the entertainment business, but that doesn't make the people he rooted out any less guilty.

Kidman was way too long in the tooth for a role like this, and the closeups had me cringing and counting the toes of her crows feet. But like i cant even begin to itemize the problems with this experimental failure.  Leguizamo you want to flog, nothing new there I guess.

","A twenty something actor with the anti-depressant induced emotional range of the family retriever, returns home for his mothers funeral. Once back, he is made to confront his buried traumas through old and new friends, and the strange power that a hometown somehow works upon the soul. 'Scrubs' main man Braff pens a nice little script that turns out to be more than just a nice little movie. Plenty of angst, despair, and re fangled Woody Allensim to go around in this film, and for the most part it works extremely well. The casting is a complete home-run, yes even Portman is, well shes not a complete distraction lets say. The effective scenes rank up there with Indy's best, while some of the ineffective scenes do just a little too much damage. This ain't great, but its damn close.

Donnie Brasco," Brass, Brassiest, Brasco
","A more gritty look at New York mafia life than we are used to meets an idiotic domestic storyline we've seen all too often. During the mid 1970s FBI Agent Joe Pistone(Depp) successfully infiltrated Sonny Black's Brooklyn arm of the Bonnano family by winning the trust of aging hit-man Lefty Ruggierio(Pacino). While the film starts out very promising with the bonding of Pacino and Depp and some good nuts and bolts gangster action, the whole thing soon becomes trivialized and ultimately destroyed by a pointless domestic storyline that keeps eating away at the main narrative like termites, before consuming it utterly in the final reels. An unromantic take on Mob life is a refreshing departure from what we are usually fed. Very matter of fact and business-like killings, and penny ante heists more accurately reflect the day to day life of a wise guy if this is movie is accurate. Depp and Pacino might be said to red line the NY accent, but they don't. Born bred NYers talk like this and worse. But its Anne Heche or her character which makes an otherwise interesting enjoyable movie sorta unwatchable. The whole notion of Depp battling a rocky marriage while performing an undercover sting operation should be left for the soap operas and bad TV crime shows.",Null,1,3,29 June 2004
Mulholland Drive," The Opus of a Genius
","I think this is Lynch's best film yet. He finally makes the Eraserhead he wanted to so many years ago. There's a little bit of all his best visions and ideas throughout, so its almost a retrospective. But mostly I see Eraserhead done with an unlimited budget and a maturity of thought. The movie is long, 2 1/2 hours, but the pace builds, keeps you involved and progressively interested. Something his recent films have just failed to do. I have to laugh at the people who wrote negative comments, and would bet they are the same Martians who loved an infantile headache like Moulin Rouge. I've often wondered how Hitchcock or David Lean would have shot material considered unsuitable in their day. Lets just say Lynch does the girl on girl thing pretty damn well.",9,1,2,22 October 2002
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Sensually Stimulating, Cerebally Deadening
","Like most of Burton's work, 99.98% of the energy here and Id imagine budget went straight to set design and costume, and the perfect camera-work to get it juuust right. I admit that Tim Burton has made a couple of films that I count among my favorites. When it works, its pretty damn amazing. But as we are reminded in Charlie, more often then not, it doesn't work. To be fair, I cant really knock the visual impact this film delivers. And if that alone sates your movie-going appetite, you will love Charlie. If you are like me however, and expect more for your 11 quid than 5 music videos linked by an insipid narrative with hollow characterizations, Charlie is quite likely to make you once again involuntarily utter, 'man there's a lot of bad movies out there these days.' Tim Burton presents Charlie and the Chocolates Factory and ostensibly seeks to pull off not just a remake, but a re-telling more in line with the actual Roald Dahl's children's classic. What was wrong with the Gene Wilder film? Good question. Again visually its the bomb-digger, you cant argue with it. Plotwise, for the most part, ain't bad. So whats the problem you ask? The film doesn't play, at all!! The characters especially the main characters other than Wonka and perhaps Charlie, have about as much flesh on them as the Corpse Bride and muster zero sympathy. The film wows your senses and even delights you with the song and dance numbers, the only real achievement of the film in my estimation, but does a very poor job in storytelling. Very poor. The emotional impact that touched all of my generation, is nowhere to be found in the remake. We get this quandary a lot now with these remakes that are so technically superior to their predecessor, that you feel stupid not calling them an improvement on the original. As far as the Charlie comparison is concerned, the remake's only attribute is that it helps make the original shine even more brilliantly. Which sadly brings me to my final observation. This film has the distinction of showcasing Johhny Depp in what might be his worst characterization of his great career. Depps Wonka looks for all the world like a Technicolor incarnation of the fiend in the lost silent classic, London After Midnight. He 'acts' like the alleged fiend known as pop star Michael Jackson, and sounds exactly like Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie!!!! Put a hatchet in his hand, and you'd have the makings of a good Hammer film.

For Love of the Game," For The Love of Peace!
","No more Costner Baseball movies please! This one is well made i guess, and even Costner kicks the wooden acting up a few notches. But what's the point really, who banks these movies? They cant possibly make any money. Is there a legion of Costner or baseball fans who wait for these things to be released? Now for the kicker, I love baseball. I am absolutely devoted to the game. If I was a filthy rich actor, I might just do the same thing. Dress up in a Yankee uniform and live out a childhood fantasy. But I wouldn't film it, and then palm it off as a motion picture. Im being extremely hard on a film that is technically ok. The storyline is a sappy overworked one but not too badly written, the acting so so, and the attempt at realism above average. Licensing fees were shelled out to use actual major league clubs and stadiums and even announcers, and the camera work almost convinces you that Costner is out there pitching. So what am i complaining about? It comes down to the self indulgence of Mr. Costner whom Ive never met but have to suppose owns the largest ego ever to be captured on film. I don't see a baseball movie, I see a horrible actor getting off on watching himself pitch against the Yankees. By the way, that's another unforgivable part of this move. the anti Yankee, and anti New York sentiment that runs throughout as subtle as a tornado weather alert crawl on the bottom of the screen. Bogus and offensive. This movie sucks, Costner is crappy and New Yorkers deserve and apology.",3,1,3,23 February 2002
Quiz Show," Wake Up Folks - Movies Are Not Real
","An extremely well made and enjoyable film, its a hat tipper to director Robert Redford. The cast is a wonderful ensemble, a dream troupe really of veterans and current stars, who all seem so perfectly natural, that again you have to marvel at Redford's expertise. But, my endorsement for this picture comes with a footnote. I have a real problem with historical movies trying to pass off their stories, well told and entertaining as they may be, as the gospel truth. Any person viewing this movie will no doubt believe that this scandal went down exactly as it is portrayed here. But look more carefully, and you can separate the facts, from the Hollywood fiction. The facts are what we know can be proven, the Senate testimonies of Van Doren, and the admissions of Stempfel that prompted the investigation. But what of the rest? What of the oh so incriminating and slanderous conversations between the network executives, the allegations of cover up, is this all really true? Perhaps, but more than likely, the movie uses its share of license with reality. And it has to, movies usually go all the way and present a complete one sided view, that is so throughly convincing because of the medium, you are left with the misbegotten feeling of having received an education. Each and every word that was scripted for all i know may have actually been said, and each person painted as a villain may have truly deserved the treatment received in this film. Somehow though, I doubt it. The fact that it is presented as a tell all expose, about a notorious cover up, but in itself is a fabrication of the facts, just strikes me as completely ironic. But thats Hollywood.",Null,1,3,20 August 2002

Since the film predates the moon landing, I still don't know how the hell he did it. Its plot, while interesting in a whacky sublime sorta way, is really not all that important to the experience. The acting too is true to all of his other films; well done but just a little on the warped side. It all comes down to the photography. Kubrick is one of only a handful of moviemeakers who have ever been able to produce what can be considered art via the motion picture. The screen becomes a living canvas.

Singin' in the Rain," The Apex of the MGM Musical
","Classic musical that features superb song and dance numbers woven about an uncharacteristically engaging story. Fluffy as you would expect, but downright heartwarming and as entertaining as any film ever made. Shot in that magnificent color typical of the era.I know there's a Woody Allen movie where his character tells Mia this is the only film he actually owns, and he watches it whenever he gets depressed. Thats a spot on description describing this film's relevance. I personally find Singing in the Rain to be one of a handful of perfect efforts. Set in the 1920s its a loving sendoff of the industry's early years and its transition from silent to talkie. I am by no means an MGM buff, some if not most of them I cant bear to watch, some of Gene Kellys especially since while the acrobatic dancing stuff is always cool, the movies are often just dumb if not annoying. Not so here. Singin in the Rain has a clever innocence which is sadly a memory now in film-making, that evokes laughs and tears and leaves you feeling just a little better about life than before you watched it.

Film starts out well, interesting, and clever, but somewhere after the first half hour unravels utterly. The plausibility goes directly from Hollywood cool downhill straight into Superman comic book land. It's way too much to itemize. I guess James Bond has been doing that sort of thing for years, but only recently have they too crossed the insult your intelligence line. MI has some very exciting and suspenseful moments, and a cast and a half to enact them for us. I just wish it had been toned down action technology wise, and beefed up with story believability or replaced a few of the tedious double crosses with um...a plot? Would have been quite good.

From Hell," Those Bums, They Made Hagrid Cry!!
","Hey guess what, this crime is officially still UNSOLVED. You did not just watch a documentary, but a fairy tale. Got it? I sure hope so. Let me back up and start with the good elements. It's a triumph of atmosphere that really put the polish on the Michael Caine TV movie, which is quite similar to a point, especially in naming the same culprit as this bomb does. The suspense and the murders are done without going overboard on the red red krovvy. And for a movie I hate, I did love the scene in Mary Kelly's room, showing the Ripper composing himself just before he strikes his final and most brutally butchered victim. If you haven't yet had a chance, go to your local library and take a look at the actual police photograph of the crime scene. It will haunt your slumbers! Slick and thought provoking visually, but oh how terribly Stupid story and otherwise. Once again, the British Empire plays whipping boy to the Hollywood loonies, who know full well the Brits will just sit and take it. The only thing factual is that there really was a Jack the Ripper, and a Queen of England named Victoria. The rest, straight out of a heroin daze. The topper, the scene with Victoria showing she had full knowledge of the crimes. Right out of Python, sans the humor. Eventually we'll see a version where Victoria herself actually does the killing. Think this movie gets popped into the Palace VCR on Sunday afternoons? 'Hey, throw that flicker in where great great great great grandmamma orders that Ripper chap to kill all those tarts.'

Reservoir Dogs," One of the Great Ones
","Bunch of crooks plan and then botch a jewelry heist and learn that one of their own is a rat. How realistic is this, I obviously cannot say. It does provide for moments of incredulity, particularly in the lack of due diligence taken by the crime boss in scouting out a nubie who eventually turns rat. I could see not being sure about a guy, but I don't think a big time boss would ever take the risk of incriminating himself by talking minutia with the hired goons. Thats counter to the entire principle of organized crime, least what I've always been led to believe. But thats nitpicky stuff, because the movie otherwise is a knockout in almost every sense of the word. Tarantino delivers on style and script in a way which he has never been able to replicate. If you like gangster films, this must be seen, and you will probably want to own it. OK one last criticism, Tim Roth. AAGH!!! Q must be the only filmmaker who likes him or believes in his work.

Total Recall," Get Your Ahss to Moz
","Imaginative but utterly dreadful Schwarzeneger vehicle, with quite possibly the worst script ever written. Perhaps there was simply no money left after the special effects budget to employ a writer, so everyone improvised, or maybe just wrote their own lines? As for the special effects, excellent in their imagination, but like Arnold's one time mysterious box office appeal, Time has rudely passed it by. Much of the set design too seems victim of an expired budget, so that by the last half hour, it watches like a Star Trek episode. From the Kirk era. In fact, it all looks pretty damn silly now. Tron, Logan's Run, etc.  And the violence, good gracious! Like most of Verhoeven's action 'work' this movie is obscenely violent, and the inane dialogue strives to set a new record in gratuitous usage of the F word for the F word's sake. I wonder when watching a movie like this, and spotting all of the product placement i.e. Pepsi, Jack In the Box, Lite Beer, what future generations will make of all this? Probably wonder why none of the sex pornography of our generation wasn't likewise sponsored by the consumer product giants.

It is our own disappointment in this realiziation that the movie somehow brings home, and that has bred the general chagrin amongst most viewers. Most adult viewers that is.

The Godfather: Part III," Vendetta!!!!
","-Hollywood editor is mysteriously whacked thereby allowing delusional self important director to run amok and release a completely bloated un-edited nightmare, that is nothing short of epic badness.FF Coppola immortalized himself by making arguably 2 of the greatest films ever, Godfather and Godfather II. But like many of us, he then got old, fat and a lot less brilliant. The result was the release of this unsought and completely superfluous 3rd film, which is remarkable only as a testament to bad film-making, bad judgment and the fleeting quality of genius. Godfather 3 has indeed become nearly as famous for its badness as its 2 predecessors were for their excellence. What i will say on its behalf, is that it probably could have been salvaged and but for a horrible non-existent editing job, might have been OK. Much could be repaired by merely chopping the more idiotic dialog exchanges that infect nearly every scene. Only in some instances i think are the scenes themselves wholly idiotic enough to just be omitted completely. It would be challenging but interesting to re-edit, because the movie for all of its deserved bad press, has a lot of good stuff within and the story I have found after repeated viewings that the story is interesting. Its just weighed down utterly by too many scenes containing horrendous acting with actual laugh inducing moronic dialog, that never should have left the cutting room, if a cutting room actually existed. I think I finally see exactly what Coppola was trying to do, and the idea was a good one. Yet I also see how fine the line is between a good film maybe even a better than average film, and a joke like this one. We all know how many 'takes' go into each and every scene before one is selected for the final print. Now imagine taking all the Worst takes, and this is what you would get.

They and this film are then showered with Oscars by a Hollywood establishment that has truly lost its balance, in a poignant nose thumbing gesture of a ceremony. For my own part I watched it with a clean conscience on HBO, so I didn't really pay for it, at least it didn't feel like I paid for it. Throw all of that rubbish aside and I must admit Mystic River is a damn good movie, although it falls rather short of classic or even memorable. But its good, and definitely superior to most of your other cinematic options. Nothing exactly bold and new in terms of story here. Film has a little State of Grace, Good Will Hunting, and a lot of Sleepers in it. Little too much Sleepers if you ask me, almost plays like a remake at certain points.

Enemy at the Gates," Mr. Brehznev, you are reading the Olympic Rings.
","Movie all in all is good, but too claustrophobic. They must have blown the entire budget on the opening scenes which are quite amazing, but then the remainder is all backlot, soundstage monotony. It got real old for me. The story, interesting though it was, didn't need to be this long in the telling. Performances are good; Hoskins is great as Khrushchev, and Jude Law excellent as the silent hero. Rachel Weisz, Hey Now!  Ed Harris, he's not so good. Gives an uncharacteristically doped performance. He was probably paid by the word. The one thing I do commend is the treatment of the Soviets as protagonist. Just who was a bigger maniac Stalin or Hitler, isn't a question worth contemplating. The film was more than fair in its treatment of the average Red Army soldier. Showing the brutality of the Stalin regime towards its own citizens, especially its military personnel, as the average Vlad lived the Orwellian nightmare firsthand. Stalin sent 2 million of his men to their deaths, yes 2 million, to ensure the city that bore his name did not fall to the Nazis.

","Incredibly realistic depiction of WW1 taken form the German point of view, that faithfully adheres to book and puts most other War pictures to shame. In fact, it manages to evoke effortlessly the emotions you can see other War films desperately trying to arouse. Devoid of any political infusion, silly pro or anti war propaganda, its a strikingly realistic account of war as drudgery, commonplace and non glorious mechanized waste. Its message is simultanelously ambivalent and sanctimonious.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," 'She Likes a Rigged Game, Doc'
","There aren't many films that can hold their pop after the passing years go to work on them. This film does. Its just as powerful and fresh as when it was released. In terms of achievement, the movies of the 70s were kind of a garbage dump compared to other decades, so this one really sticks out. As for the performances, its become hard to separate Nicholson from this role, almost as if the character played him. Just like Rhett Butler and Stanley Kowalksi did for Gable and Brando. Magically happens sometimes. Kesey's story too is one of the few great novels of the last century. Director Forman gives a clinic on how to successfully make the transition, what to change and what to include. Material changes are made in execution. For example, the book is told completely through the eyes of the Chief, and the movie does an excellent job of going about it differently, but effectively. The irony of the book is of course, that the narrator (Chief) is the one bona fide lunatic in the ward. This is isnt so apparent in the film, but its not important. The performances by Lloyd, DeVito, Billy Bibbitt are just incredible. One odd bit is giving the Best Actress Oscar to Nurse Wratched. She doesn't do much, just stares straight ahead like a blind person most of the time, so she must have just rode the crest of the film's success. In fact, if you see any of her subsequent work, I think you will agree with me. This film deserves a place in everyone's top 10 list.",10,1,2,10 November 2002
Paths of Glory," Good Anti-War Fare
","A suicide assault that fails miserably in the trench combat of World War I, leads to the unjust court martial of 3 soldiers, who if found guilty are to be made examples and executed for cowardice. The brilliance of this film clearly is in the camerawork. It can't be beat. I can't decide however, whether I love the story, or hate it. The clash of the old and modern world is really what the Great War was fought over, or better put what prompted its outbreak. You have the old guard in the film, the 2 elderly generals, representing the 19th century remnants of the Napoleonic age, clashing with ideals of 20th century modern man, Kirk Douglas. And I do believe to a certain extent struggles like this were commonplace during this tumultuous period of history. But in the film, they were both ends overly caricatured if not satirized. Douglas's character seems, anachronistically speaking, out of place, more so than the old guard. Almost as if he's a lost time traveler trying to reason concepts that those inhabiting the time he is visiting have no possible way of yet comprehending. Representation of fact, probably not, but it is well written and extremely well acted. Even Douglas is outstanding. For the overwhelmingly positive hype it receives, I was somewhat surprised and decidedly letdown by its transformation from a combat action film into a courtroom drama. Not that it's slow, but I was totally eating up the action and was left wanting more. I still have to put All Quiet ahead of this, since it sticks to the facts and reports the action rather than passes judgment over war, by injecting a fictitious criminal justice proceeding, and making the good guys so to speak, the bad. We don't exactly need this to know that War is preventable calamity. The action, if done well enough, which it was here, will invariably slam that message home with authority. I'm afraid that in the end, this film leaves an after taste of rather naive and rather outdated idealism. But its quality, and worth a watch.",Null,1,1,2 August 2003
Carrie," Old before its time?
","Stephen King's modern classic about high school bullying with a little dark supernatural sprinkled in of course. It is over 30 years old, but it watches much older mainly because DePalma is as usual trying way too hard to homage/imitate someone else's direction style while at the same time putting way too indelible of a 70s dorkism stamp on the texture. Much about the pop culture of the 70s is rather non-nostalgic and cringing camp, and a film like this one so completely bathed in the decade's cheap cologne, very justifiably suffers. Carrie has some effective horror scenes, maybe even a couple iconic ones, but these are too often followed by wandering Film School exercises that leave you scratching your head as to the whereabouts of an editor. The background score is soap opera grade and distracting. The performances are very good and the casting of the hate-ables is spot on. PJ Soles and the chubby obnoxious guy from Miami Vice shine as the hard to look at, too cool for school loathsome antagonists. Yet as with virtually all King works, the book is more satisfying than the film for lots of reasons. You lump all of these many negatives together, and the result is a film that really can no longer be watched in its entirety and survives only for about 15 minutes of its effective and disturbing horror imagery, which Im sure you could just you-tube and spare yourself a wasted evening.",6,1,4,19 July 2009

1408," Rod Serling with a bludgeon
","John Cusack plays noted travel author Mike Enslin who earns his bread and cheese by visiting haunted places and then writing them up as the ubiquitous Top Ten Haunted .... We quickly observe however, that Enslin is somewhat of a fraud. He harbors cynicism and even though he sells these books to the public, he's more interested in feeding his own personal demon; to debunk the whole notion of a haunted anything. He's driven or haunted if you will by a quest to prove if only to himself that haunted houses and spirituality, and even religion, is all a lot of nonsense. When he receives an anonymous post card inviting him to spend a night in a haunted NYC hotel room, room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel to be exact, Enslin of course meets his match. From the opening frames, '1408' constructs an effective anticipatory pace- roller coaster style, and thats obviously vital in a scary film. I especially enjoyed the conversation between Cusack and the forever and needlessly angry Samuel L. Jackson. He's still that of course, but good direction here has him properly harnessed and enjoyable for a change as he does an excellent job as the obligatory 'don't go in there' hotel manager. Of note to Jackson fans, in spite of the movie poster, Jackson is a supporting character at best and on film for all of 7 minutes, maybe 8.From the effective buildup we enter at last, the haunted hotel room and the fun begins, and there the fun soon ends. Indeed the remainder of the film has us locked in the evil room with Cusack. We start slowly with some truly creepy and memorable images before eventually and all too inevitably, the full Hollywood special effects ghost treatment, floods, fire, ice, make their dreaded appearances. Some frights are really effective and for me the 15-20 minutes where the scary stuff happens sorta makes the entire film OK. But that all happens and the horror peaks and passes way too quickly. Before it ever gets really terrifying, our roller-coaster is making the slow boring return to the platform via the maudlin sub story line. I say again however, this is a good movie - using the grading scale sadly needed in the year 2009. Its good. But in keeping pace with all modern films '1408' has way too much cowbell and the special effects orgy eventually becomes boring, no matter how much you like this sorta stuff. I liken film viewing these days to hanging onto a greased pole. I'd say it took a good hour into this before I lost interest and slid off into the kitchen for some Oreos. Yet my biggest criticism, really my only substantive criticism is that '1408' apart from actually being watchable to the finish, fails to distinguish itself as a horror film. It breaks no new ground whatsoever, whether in terms of fright excitement, plot twist or even human drama. There's tons of unanswered questions, but not the provocative kind, more the kind that lead you to believe a lot of this wasn't well thought out. But I'll leave that up to you.",6,1,1,12 January 2009
Vanilla Sky," Quite agree, quite agree. Silly, silly, silly.
","Maybe I watch too many movies, but I could see the twist in this one coming a mile away. I even pinpointed the 'splice'. It just seems like I've seen this all before. Jacob's Ladder? So the sci-fi Rod Serling bit is a flop. However, the movie building towards the dopey ending was actually quite interesting. The most intriguing was the brutal reality of seeing just how crudely vital is our physical appearance. A time proven fact that moviemakers and all artists compel us to suspend when appreciating their art, but we all know has nothing to do with reality.  Example, Woody Allen getting with every hot broad in New York City. Puleeze. Cruise is a good-looking bloke, like him or not. What's more, he's great at playing the good looking bloke that gets the chicks in spite of or even as a result of his uncouth, devil may care attitude, that make the rest of us want to smack him one. This movie explores how all his successes, socially, inevitably hinged on his appearance. After he is horribly disfigured in an automobile accident, his obnoxious rake routine, carried out from behind a Quasimodo styled visage, is embarrassing to say the least. In fact, picture it in your mind right now. You know how Tom Cruise behaves when he's winning over a chick. Now imagine the Hunchback of Notre Dame acting like Tom Cruise. Doubley gruesome isn't it. There is even a scene where he and Cruz reenact the dialogue of their first meeting. It seemed witty charming and inventive when this great looking guy was performing it, but utterly awkward and dreadful coming out of the mouth of a twisted wretch. The girl now wants nothing to do with him, in spite of his wealth and everything else. He's just too freaky to look at. At this point in the film, I started thinking maybe they were onto something. But then you get the rest, and well, it's just very unsatisfying. For fans of Cruz, I will say you'll get your nudity money's worth.",Null,0,0,18 March 2003
Bull Durham," Kill me please
","Goings on during a 'typical' baseball season in the Southern League.This is like when all the things in the movie universe come together for the sole purpose of torturing me. 4 actors whom I just cant stomach, Costner, Robbins, Sarandon, and Wuhl inserted into a half witted reprehensible story and sullying one of my favorite things in life, baseball, in the process. I think Magic Johnsons travails which surfaced not too long after the release of this loserfest, officially destroyed the reputation of this movie. Until then, salivating critics wanted to annoint it film of the century. But its awful, awful and you want to take a shower after you see it.",1,12,30,29 September 2003
Signs," 'Its Just Like War of The Worlds'
","Gee, you think? How about it's just like War of the Worlds with a bad script, unhinged direction, and terrible acting. I was actually laughing out loud during a few scenes. Who knows, maybe I've totally lost it and this was meant to be a spoof of a science fiction thriller. You know like a Scary Movie type thingamajig. Lol, Shyamalan wishes! Some of the suspense segments when isolated are very effective, but the movie as a whole, is a total stinko. How could Mel Gibson even let this happen? He's usually so on the money. But every scene, including his, that's played for drama, bombs like Hezbollah. Cool premise, we all like these alien invader doomsday pieces, but this film needed an awful lot of work. I told myself midway through that if Joaquin started whacking the aliens with a baseball bat, that this would go down as an all time turkey. Well, he did and it is!!!!",1,15,32,19 July 2003
Amélie," I Thought The French Had Forgotten How To Do This
","I remember hearing a review of this film on the radio, the review was about as long as this movie. The critic liked the movie, I think, its hard to tell sometimes with them, but what I definitely felt was that he held back and couldn't throw in for it completely. His main complaint was the cinematic tricks which he said were overdone. I disagree. He also felt that the director blasts your psyche with images that are so poignantly memorable, you forget them. Or that is probably my interpretation of what he said after I just viewed this film, either way I agree with him. While watching it I was truly amazed by the beauty and thought of what I was witnessing. But its like an afternoon at the art museum, its all so much your brain simply wont register it and you wind up forgetting most of what you see. The story is a simple French love tale. Truly, that's all there is when you peel away the modernism and breathtaking cinematography. Its also the camera filming an ongoing battle of what's more enthralling, the Parisian backdrop or the heroine's beauty. Its a battle worth viewing. As someone who at times throws up his hands at the ever changing world and sees a Western Europe trying so hard to be American, this movie is all France. Its long, and halfway through you may find yourself checking your watch and groan just a wee bit. But when it ends, you'll forget it and want to do it all over again. How many times have I walked through the Impressionists wing?",10,0,1,28 February 2002
The Sixth Sense," I see Red people.
","There aren't too many movies that can give me the willies just by thinking about them too hard. But I live in a really old building, and after seeing this film, its now just too easy to imagine the specters of all the previous residents walking around me unseen. Movie totally  got under my skin, and hit that one nerve capable of stirring the sleeping primal fear. It's all woven around a very interesting and convincing drama, the scariness complimenting the drama and vice versa, just extremely well done. Bruce Willis is one of those guys that you know is a total cheese ball, yet most of his work is pretty damn good. He's great, the kid is great, the two female leads both excellent. All around top notch, no criticisms whatsoever. Oh yeah, the famous ending is probably the best twist since Dr. Calgari. Rod Serling would be proud. Now I'm good and spooked from just thinking about it again...",10,2,3,19 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Bye Bye Lucas
","This movie, all three actually are just great. Jackson tinkers slightly with the chronological presentation, and adds some collateral  stories so that Liv Tyler can earn her money. But I dont think even a purist can find any sort of fault in these films. Would have been nice to make this last one a 2 parter, so that a few items that were left off could have been added.

Thirteen Days," 13 Reasons Not To See Any Movie With Kevin Costner
","Only Kevin Costner would have hubris enough to insert his mug alongside modern day legends JFK and RFK on a DVD case. Open up the case, and Costner is a one man wrecking crew that completely weakens an otherwise powerful film. I don't know if his Kenny ODonnell character is real or fiction, but he manages to make that point irrelevant. From his Forrest Gump type omnipresence to his truly not to be believed Mayor Quimby/JFK accent, Costner does more damage to the Kennedy brothers legacy than an unexpurgated Marilyn Monroe documentary. Is any reasonable person expected to believe that ODonnell's wisdom was the final word in the drama of the Cuban Missle crisis? No, but Costner in his advanced stage of megalomania overlooks this slight detail, in order to make a film in which HE appears to save the world. Again, its a darn shame. Great subject matter naturally, and it scores big on historic drama. If only he had had the courage and humility to simply produce this movie, and left himself as a minor character, or better still, out of shot altogether, this would probably go down as one of the better movies of its time. But his idiotic totally inappropriate appearances rob this film of any sense of realism, and consequently relevance. The tragedy of the failing Hollywood system is well represented in this film and its defining use of error in motion at all levels.",5,7,17,25 January 2002
Apollo 13," Superstition Conquers Science.
","They thumbed their noses at old unlucky number 13, and it cost them. Great movie, I like it better each time I watch it. The 'goose bump' chills that come with over sappy dialogue are mitigated with repeated viewings I find. And this film is loaded with sappiness. But once you get desensitized to the Richie Cunningham lines, like `Let's go to the moon, gentlemen,' you'll really enjoy the ride this film takes you on.  Cast is great, Hanks flanked by 3 of the most prominent second fiddles in the business, Sinise, Bacon and Paxton. And the shots of mission control are just as I remembered them as a kid. Either the actress wasn't too swift, or the role was poorly written, or maybe its such a guy movie that she didn't stand a chance of holding her own, but...Lovell's wife is really a detractor, and kind of unlikable. I think the movie does a fantastic job of restirring those same emotions of utter awe at what we were accomplishing by walking on the moon. Something we haven't done since, oddly enough.  These early missions were carried forth, more on grit than on technology. I'm sure each of you reading this has more processing firepower in your PC than the entire space program had at the time. Mind boggling. Slide rules to do critical calculations while the ship is spinning out of control. Slide Rules!!!!",Null,0,1,18 January 2003
The Great Escape," Today, on the 4:30 movie...
","Ever notice how these movies hold up except for the humor? McQueen as usual is just too hammy, every time he opens his mouth or mugs for the camera he kind of shoots the movie down, and it has to start building up all over again. This and various plot holes aside, the film is good and hard to 'put down'. The scenery shots flying around Germany and Switzerland are wonderful. But its far from perfect, I just found the stupidity of the Nazis in their ability to guard the prison camp too Col Klinkish. Amazing how once the prisoners escape, the Nazis then become this efficient crack bloodhound machine able to track them down through 3 countries. Coburn's Australian accent was nowhere to be found. Funny the Americans always play their WW2 roles for laughs and the indominatable spirit, against the usually sober more serious English characters who just want to get the job done already. Enjoyable as it is, I watched this expecting a war drama, and it didn't really deliver.",Null,2,5,13 September 2003
Gangs of New York," Movies Like This Have Only One Goal; Profit
","For anyone who has not read the book of the same title written in the 1920s I believe, permit me to disclose the following: Very little in this movie has any basis in fact. Some of the people, most notably Bill the Butcher, did exist Boss Tweed of course, but none of these events as portrayed in the film actually happened. So with that in mind, can you accept or even enjoy this movie? Depends on you I suppose. My knowledge and love of history compels me to give it very low marks. The performances are sound, most notably Lewis, and Scorsese works his patented visual magic, but the film I gotta say overall is a total bomb. Long movies are good only when long movies are entertaining. To me this was more of the same industrial opium with good set and costume. The film's message of immigrant paranoia however is a valid redeeming one, and should be heeded. But I wonder how many people will find themselves able to glean any sort of theme whatsoever once this bloodbath finally draws to a close. The history of New York is fascinating, no ciy's is moreso. One can only hope that this film inspired a few well meaning people to pick up a book and learn how it really was. Truth as always trumps fiction. Especially cheap crappy fiction.",Null,0,1,12 January 2004
Braveheart," A Mad Look at British History
","Kevin Costner must go nuts watching Braveheart, thinking, 'Hey I make a stinking' historical movie like this and people kill it.' Right you are Sir. In fact, it's really only the amazing screen power of Mel Gibson that makes this movie so damn good. Hollywood has shown us that sparing no expense in making a historical epic is by no means any guarantee of a quality effort. A Costner, or equally fishlike lead could probably have sunk this film as well. But Mel does a super job of keeping stuffy old history light, quite enjoyable and even inspirational. You have to know this is an outrageous mutation of the facts. To suggest that a Scottish outlaw sired the entire line of British monarchy is the sort of insult with which all former dominions seek to slap the broken empire. But please don't for a minute think it possible. People in such high places didn't fool around in those days, and take such chances. I don't care how googie in love they may have been. Isabella would have been roasted on the palace spit, once folks got a gander at the child's appearance. The truth is that, the fruit of this supposed union, Edward III bore a striking resemblance to Edward I. Historians think it probable that the child was therefore the issue of his own grandfather. Why these things bother me so much, I can't tell you. I'm not even British. I don't have a problem with an undersized Australian portraying a 7-foot Scot. Wallace's sword they say weighs more than Mel Gibson after a big meal. They still have it if you don't believe me. And I guess the events, transpired so long ago that it's excusable to cloud them and finagle history if the end result is a torrid love scene that de-tops a French hottie. Not. It bugs me that in films of this genre, Britain and America to a lesser extent, must suffer these slings and arrows as a sort of penance for world domination. There are simply far too many cretins who will only ever know their history by either going to the cinema or by squeezing butt pimples in front of their own television. Filmmakers I'm afraid bear a responsibility to educate these poor souls by not so smearing fact with conjecture. Or at least, informing them that in spite of the wicked cool accents and smart costumes, what they are viewing didn't really happen. I Do like this movie but at the same time, I'm afraid I will never be able to take it any more seriously than another historical send up by a different man named Mel. Mel Brooks, you must have heard of him.",Null,0,1,12 December 2002
True Romance," Fresh Love Story from Q's 15 Minutes of Fame
","Tarrentino's films all give the impression of being segments or episodes in an all encompassing interelated saga. That's probably more of a shot than a compliment however. The Q to me has always meant Quirk, not much else. True Romance has a couple of truly fabulous scenes, but overall, the movie only rates as good. Too much is variations on themes he explores in previous or subsequent stuff, and the repetiveness to me is boring. Slater in lieu of his usual Jack Nicholson impression, instead here, gives us Harvey Keitel (I think). The accent he employs wanders in and out of his performance, and invokes cringes at points. The rest of the cast is terrific, and the film warrants a viewing just to see all of these huge performers working together in one project. Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Tony Soprano, Gary Oldman, Samel Jackson, Dennis Hopper...very cool.",Null,1,2,23 January 2004
Donnie Darko," Triumph of Direction
","I am not going to even attempt a synopsis here, for two reasons. I couldn't do it justice, and its really very worthwhile to view this movie dead cold. Besides, I'm pretty sure I don't exactly understand the movie. I watched it a bunch of times, listened to the director's commentary...and I still don't get it!! I mean you end up sort of understanding everything, but a part of your brain just doesn't click with total comprehension. Having said that, I love it! The director threw a major bulls-eye on virtually all counts. The performances are bizarre, but so well done and the style, which really defines this movie, is your basic blast of fresh air. When you listen to the director and how incredibly budget strapped he was, you gain total respect for what he was able to do here. There are so so many films that have unlimited cashola, that are utter crap. Not to say, this chap might not do the same on a bigger film, but here he gives us one that if not for the brilliant way it was shot, well it could easily have been pretty awful. The cast again, some really big names who were obviously just totally on the wavelength of the idea and did an art for arts sake good deed, giving just absolutely first rate performances. Just nice to see and nicer still to enjoy. Good job too with the soundtrack if I may say so. Bully!!!",9,0,1,11 September 2003
Born on the Fourth of July," 'The Worst Years of Our Lives'
","A biography of Viet Nam Vet turned anti-war activist, Ron Kovic, this remains one of the more powerful, and graphically disturbing 'coming home' pictures to come out of Hollywood. I think the footage depicting Mr. Kovic's recovery in a rat infested, ill-equipped VA Hospital are by far the most lasting. Tom Cruise's performance as Ron Kovic is nothing short of amazing. You will find yourself forgetting the actor behind the roll, a feat Tom Cruise rarely accomplishes. The film has lost some of its punch over time, mainly because Oliver Stone's magic has all but faded to the point that you now uncover flaws in his earlier films, that might have gone unnoticed had he not exposed himself in his later works. The zealously religous yet unfeeling mother figure rears her head in this film as well as in Nixon, as an example. Watch this if only for Cruise's performance, but be warned it may take you to a place emotionally you might have wished to avoid.",Null,3,4,6 July 2001
Rock Star," Mixed Messages and a Whole Lot of Wigs...
","Gotta love a movie that cant decide whether its glorifying something or villifiyng it. Odds are this was intended originally as a kick in the pants to the music business, but as production moved along, the whole concept of movies being a business took over. So in order to make this rotter marketable, the producers chickened out and end up advertising for the very things they are seeking to expose. Marky Mark is cool, but he and his agents had better learn how to read a script. There is so much wrong with this film, it would take too long fo me to write it, and for you to read it. If Jennifer Aniston wasn't basically topless, calm down, she isnt, but what she wears might actually may be more tantalizing than if she did strut around the entire movie like tarzan. Take them out of this movie, and you wouldnt last 5 minutes.",Null,0,3,24 February 2003
