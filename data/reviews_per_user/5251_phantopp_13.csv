Angels & Demons," A good mystery movie
","'Robert Langdon' (Tom Hanks) is back, and he has only a few hours to solve a mystery to save thousands of Catholic faithful, and top candidates for role of pope, before an incident which will kill them all as they await the announcement of who the new leader of the church will be.Now, 'Langdon', along with a woman who helped create antimatter in a lab, must figure out the clues and save the faithful of the world's largest church.Let me say first that this is much better than the original movie, which I barely remember seeing. You really don't need to read the novel that the movie is based upon to enjoy it.There are some really good performances in this film, especially from Hanks, who proved himself as a solid leading man many times. Here, he really shines as a leading man.There is some serious problems with character development with supporting characters, especially 'Dr. Vittoria Vetra' (Ayelet Zurer), whose antimatter is being used as a weapon, and 'Camerlengo Patrick McKenna' (Ewan McGregor), who turns an interesting plot twist that I never expected at the end, but isn't seen as much as I would like.Another problem with this movie is that it is obvious that they opted for green screen for many scenes depicting Roman Catholic churches within Rome's city limits (the church refused to allow the movie to be filmed at the locations since the church declared the book offensive to the church). A barely trained eye (which I have since I learned TV production back in high school) could see the actors were in front of a green screen. These effects will become noticeable to the untrained eye as the film ages, and special effects advance.One thing this movie does pretty well is that it gives very little time for the audience to breathe between action and plot advancing scenes. You get excited as 'Langdon' and 'Vetra' get closer to the murderer(s) as they discover new clues.Despite not being able to shoot on location, and the threat of a strike at the time, Ron Howard did a great job in the director's chair as usual. He was able to use interesting camera angles to help tell the story nicely.I can't really say I noticed the soundtrack of the movie, since I barely pay attention to instrumentals since that's not my style I listen to. I do notice that it helped the scenes, and in this movie it did.If you see this on any of the movie channels like HBO, or on Netflix, check this one out.",8,0,0,18 May 2011
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Not a lot to keep an adult's interest
","Three unlikely friends, 'Sid the Land Sloth' (voiced by John Leguizamo), 'Manford 'Manny' the Wolly Mamoth' (voiced by Ray Ramono) and 'Diego the Saber-tooth Tiger' (voiced by Dennis Leary) have discovered that the ice damn keeping the area they and other species live dry is melting. There claims are confirmed by a vulture.The residents of this area go on a journey to a natural boat made out of a large tree for safety. Along the way, they meet 'Ellie' (voiced by Queen Latifah), a female Wolly Mamoth who believes she is a possum, and her two 'brothers', and actual possums, 'Eddie' (voiced by Josh Peck) and 'Crash' (voiced by Seann William Scott).The group then go on an adventure to the boat, while trying to dodge predators that are following them.Let me say first that this movie is very much a kids movie. There are a lot of things that kids will like, but the adults will find pretty boring.A lot of times, this movie seems to drag and drag. I found myself looking more at my computer than paying attention as to what was going on on my television.When it comes to humor, I can't say that it's a great comedy movie. In fact, the jokes either produced nothing or a mild chuckle. There was a pretty good laugh near the end of the movie, and some pretty good laughs with 'Scrat the Saber-tooth Squirrel' (voiced by Chris Wedge). I just wasn't real amused with the movie's humor.Another thing I was not impressed with was the music. I can barely remember two tunes, but none of the lyrics, except a little bit that was sung by one of the characters after the scene, because he found it catchy.One thing I was pretty impressed with was the animation. Although the creatures were cartoonish looking, which was by design, they were well done. The detailing is not that great though, you only see any sense of movement of muscles with the mammoths. But, because this movie is target to kids, the didn't bring out the details that other movies have had.I also think that the story itself was only fair -- maximum. There are numerous times where the movie begins to move at a slow snail's pace. During these scenes, like I said earlier, I found myself paying attention more to my computer. Kids really don't care about a story except for one that can keep their attention. I honestly can't give you an age limit on an audience for this movie. But, if you are in your tweens or above, I would say skip this movie.",3,0,1,18 August 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pretty good, but somewhat lags at times
","'Lord Cutler Beckett' (Tom Hollander), who has declared war on piracy to the point that he will order the hanging of a child who is remotely associated with pirates, is in the possession of 'Davy Jones'' (Bill Nighy) heart. Since he has the heart, 'Jones' has no choice but to do his bidding, and goes after every pirate ship to destroy it.However, the great pirate, 'Captain Jack Sparrow' (Johnny Depp) is trapped in Davy Jones' Locker, and has to be released by the crew of his ship, which are being led by 'Will Turner' (Orlando Bloom) and his love, 'Elizabeth Swann' (Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley).Let me say first that some of the scenes are hard to see on television. This is due to the shadowing and dark colors used in these scenes. I noticed that I was paying more attention to my computer than the movie during these scenes.The performances, on the other hand, are as good as the last movie in the series I've seen (I have not seen the entire series, and do not recall which one was the last one I watched). Knightley is wonderful as the leading lady who seems to get in some trouble at times, but can fight back when needed. Bloom is nearly perfect as the charmer. Nighy is real good, but the animation effects on the tentacles off the character's face may be a little distracting to pay attention. And Depp is absolutely fun in what may be the role he will be remembered for when his time has come.Another thing you can't help but notice is the wardrobes and special effects. The pirates outfits appear to have not been washed in about eight months, while the military uniforms appear to be authentic. As for the special effects, they are absolutely fabulous -- especially make-up effects. You can actually believe the actors faces are real and not prosthetics.As for action, I wasn't too impressed. Because of when the movie is set, you get cannon fire and a lot of sword play. If you ask me, there is just a little too much going on with sword-fights involving most of the cast. In one scene, a ceremony takes place during one of these sword-fights. The fighting around the ceremony, which briefly stopped when one of the others came in to fight those involved, was pretty distracting. However, this scene got some funny moments, as intended.I didn't think that the actors chemistry was not that great in this film. When Knightley, Bloom reconnect on-screen with Depp, it just didn't work that well if you ask me. I also found that there was little chemistry with the new cast members and the ones already established in the franchise.Another thing I was not really impressed with was the soundtrack. Although the music enhanced many scenes, I just can't remember any of the music except the excerpt of 'A Pirate's Life' sung by 'Sparrow' to himself at the end of the movie just prior to the closing credits. Most of the tunes are instrumentals, and are done well. However, none are really memorable.The script itself was kind of weak as well. I think the writers slacked off after the success of the first movie. The story is pretty good, though far-fetched with the story with the heart.If you are a fan of the franchise, check this movie out. However, if you have not seen this movie, I strongly suggest that you watch the entire series due to the majority of the characters are well established in this film. I think only one or two characters had some character development in this film, and we learned some background on them. While other characters had little to no new development of any kind.I would rent this one, and only add it if you have the other movies in the series in your video library.",Null,0,3,24 February 2009
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Disappointed in this classic
","'Gorge Cassidy' (Paul Newman), a.k.a. 'Butch Cassidy', and 'Lonny Longbaugh' (Robert Redoford), a.k.a. 'The Sundance Kid, are two of the greatest robbers in the history of the Old West. They pulled jobs on banks and trains with an expertise that made them famous from coast to coast.Now, years after being out of the business for about two decades, they decide to pull one last bank heist in Bolivia, with the help of a school teacher (Katharine Ross) with romantic ties to both men.I have to say that I am pretty disappointed in this film. I found it to be slow, with not enough action considering the topic of the movie. It dragged so much that I noticed spending more attention to my computer than watching the movie itself on cable television.One thing that stood out was the on-screen relationship between Newman and Redford. This is what carries the movie I believe, and most likely why this movie is called a classic now. You feel as if the two are not just partners in crime, but friends with the ribbing that they give one another.Another problem with this movie is the soundtrack. The only piece of music that is memorable is Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head by BJ Thomas, and that was a weird tune for a Western set in the Old West. If you ask me, the song was just an odd choice.I also barely enjoyed Ross as 'Etta Place'. Her character was barely developed if you asked me. It appeared that she was there as a romantic interest, and to help teach 'Butch' and 'Sundance' Spanish for their attempt at robbing the Bolivian bank.If you expect a lot of gunfights, you are mistaken on this one. Of what there is in the movie, they are short and well placed.The cinematography is hard for me to judge since Encore Westerns used a pan-and-scan format. I had to deal with only half of a scene when two people were talking to one another. But, from wide shots, I could see some spectacular scenery, including the famous scene when the title characters jump from a cliff into the water.Because it was declared a classic, I've been wanting to see this movie. I am highly disappointed in it.",5,3,5,18 May 2011
The Dark Knight," Almost dark enough
","A madman has brought his wrath to 'Gotham City' (Chicago, Illinois) which is finally cleaning out the criminal element. That man is known to authorities as 'The Joker' (Heath Ledger). And there is only one man who can stop him -- a masked vigilante known as 'The Batman' (Christian Bale).However, another man is trying to do, legally, what the 'Caped Crusader' has been doing. That man is the District Attorney 'Harvey Dent' (Aaron Eckhart), who eventually becomes what 'Bruce Wayne' (Bale) fights to become in his dark alter-ego.The two men who are trying to get 'The Clown Prince of Crime' each have the same partner -- 'Lt. James Gordon' (Gary Oldman), who is one of the only uncorrupt cops on the force. But, 'Batman' has two more partners in his battle against evil -- 'Alfred' (Sir Michael Caine), the 'Wayne' family butler and 'Bruce's' life-long confidant. 'Batman's' other partner is the CEO of 'Wayne Enterprises', 'Lucius Fox' (Morgan Freeman), who is the man behind all of 'Batman's' weaponry.First of all, let me say that this movie is, in my opinion, as close to perfect as you can come. Especially compared to movies I've seen recently. There are way more pros than cons if you ask me.First of all, most of the movie is just a little too bright for the world of 'Batman.' The scenes set during sunlight were just not dark enough to set the right mood for this world originally created in DC Comics. Personally, I would have liked to have seen dimmer lighting in many day scenes where the lighting could be controlled.Like in the last film, I really had a problem with the 'Batmobile.' It looked more like a military vehicle, and not something 'Batman' should be behind the wheel of. Yes, it's painted black, but every version of the famed vehicle always reminded you of a bat in some way.I also had a problem with how some of the characters were used. First of all, this movie, like all in the genre, expects the audience to know the background of the main characters for the most part. I still have a problem with Caine, an Academy Award winner, as 'Alfred.' I just can't picture him as a butler, and he was barely used in this film. Personally, I wish he and Morgan were in the film a little bit more -- especially Caine since Morgan was in the film a bit more often.Despite the weak writing of the characters, I found the performances pretty strong. Heath Ledger, who died shortly after filming this movie, is almost perfect as 'Joker'. He captures the insane tone of the character very well, and completely brings you into the performance. Bale is really good as 'Batman,' although I thought his voice for the character was a bit much. He really did a good job as 'Wayne' though.Caine and Morgan, though under used in my opinion, did a great job with what they were given. You really felt that 'Fox' knew why 'Wayne' wanted the equipment, but knew not to ask. I also thought Caine made 'Alfred' more a father-figure than a butler. In fact, I can't even remember one time when he acted more like a butler.I was almost impressed with Eckhart until he became his evil alter-ego, 'Two-Face.' It wasn't until his change that he really picked up his performance.If you ask me, Maggie Gyllenhaal had no chance at making 'Rachel Dawes' her own. She had to fill the role created by Katie Holmes in 'Batman Begins', and really didn't do anything that made you forget Holmes in the first movie. In fact, she just didn't make me feel for her when she met her fate in the film that was used as part of 'Dent's' dive into madness. They tried to make her look like Holmes, but only made her look like a younger sister to her.Of course, there is a lot of action in this film. These scenes are fast-paced, and done perfectly. These scenes are edited very well, and get the job done. Another special effect which stands out is the 'Two-Face' make-up, which is actually CGI edited over Eckhart's face in post-production. It wasn't until I saw some production stills online that I thought it was some very elaborate makeup.The music was done really well in this movie. Although I couldn't tell you any pieces of music used if I heard it again, the music really enhanced scenes. Like the soundtrack should, the music was used perfectly.I wouldn't put this in the top five of your 'Must See' list, but I would suggest that you check this one out the next time you find it on HBO, or even the next time you visit your local rental store or Netflix.",9,2,8,30 August 2009
Rocky III," Almost loses 'The Eye of the Tiger' half-way through
","'Rocky Balboa' (Sylvester Stallone, who also wrote and directed the movie), the Professional Boxing World Heavyweight Champion, is living the life he sought. He lives in a huge house with his family, has been on the cover of various magazines and has numerous endorsement deals. However, unknown to him, he has gotten soft inside the ring to the point where his manager, 'Mickey' (Burgess Meredith) booked him in bouts with inferior fighters. Even getting in the ring with the cocky professional wrestling star, 'Thunderlips' (Hulk Hogan in his acting debut).He lost his edge, and 'Mickey' knew it. However, the champ wouldn't believe it. He even went against 'Mickey's' orders, and accepted the challenge of 'Clubber Lang' (Mr. T in one of his most famous roles), a tough, bad attitude boxer who rapidly reached the Number One Contendership by himself with no trainer helping him out.'Mickey' warned 'Balboa' not to accept 'Lang's challenge, but the mohawked fighter verbally went after the champ's wife (Talia Shire) at a public appearance. He immediately accepted the challenge. However, 'Mickey' was proved right, and 'Balboa' lost the title to 'Lang.' And, to make things worse, 'Mickey' suffers a heart attack backstage during a confrontation between 'Balboa' and 'Lang', and dies in the dressing room as 'Lang' easily defeats the champion for the title.Now, 'Balboa' has to regain what he once had. And he gets help from an old rival (Carl Weathers). A rival who once saw the 'Eye of the Tiger' when he fought 'The Italian Stallion' himself for the title.This is one slow moving movie, especially about half-way through the film. I saw myself looking at websites around that time more than watching the film on On Demand. It does pick up leading up to the rematch between the two boxing rivals around the time 'Apollo Creed' shows up.The acting is near perfect all around. You knew almost immediately when 'Balboa' admits that he lost his edge, by Stallone's performance in the scene, that the death of 'Mickey' affected him deeply. Certain cast members were performing characters who were more important in the previous two movies. I felt that they were there because they somewhat advanced the storyline, or were just there because they have been part of the series since the first movie in the franchise.I liked the chemistry between Stallone and Weathers in this film. In previous films, they were rivals, and now they are on the same side. They acted like two professionals in one of the toughest sports on the planet, one now acting more like a teacher more than a rival who was still annoyed at once losing the title to his now-student. Weathers really shined in this role, making the audience forget how arrogant he was six years before in the first movie.Another breakout performance was that of Mr. T. Surprisingly, as 'Balboa' is getting back his edge, 'Lang' is almost forgotten. The film focuses more on 'Balboa' training for the rematch more than 'Lang' living the life of the defending champion. You almost completely forget he was in the movie until he comes back into the story for the rematch. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some references to 'Lang' as 'Balboa' is in training. This was the role that gave Mr. T his tough guy image. He was the bad guy you wanted to see destroyed.This film is predictable. You know who will win at the end. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some plot twists that would have made the end a little less predictable.Another problem with this film is the soundtrack. I can only remember two songs in the film -- the 'Rocky Theme' piece that is so recognizable now you know immediately where it came from, and 'Eye of the Tiger' by the one-hit-wonder (this song) Survivor.Another problem with this film is, at times, it is hard to understand Stallone's speaking. At times, I had to rely on what others in the scene were saying in response to understand what was going on.Unless you already own the other movies, I say get this film on VHS/DVD to complete the series. I also think that this would be a pretty good third choice to rent.",6,1,4,27 July 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," For nobody except Tenacious D fans
","'JB' (Jack Black) runs away from home after being spanked by his father (Meat Loaf). Years later, he finally makes it to Hollywood and comes across the greatest guitar player he has ever heard, 'KG' (Kyle Glass).After a little squabble, the two decide join forces and perform at an Open Mic Night at what appears to be a less than popular bar. To their shock, they don't do that good.Back at their less than spectacular apartment, the two are trying to figure out what the legends of rock have that they don't while looking at some old magazines. It's only then that they realize that the guitarists on the covers have the same guitar pick.While trying to look for a similar pick, an employee of the music shop (Ben Stiller, who is also the film's Executive Producer) tells him the ancient story of the 'Pick of Destiny', of which they seek. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that the pick, which was made from Satan's tooth, is in a history of rock museum.Now the two pot-smoking losers with delusions of grandeur goes on a music-filled adventure to steal the pick.Let me say this up front, if you are not a fan of Tenacious D, which gave us the comedy actor Jack Black, then you should skip this one. I am not a fan of these two, and only watched it because it was suggested by Flixter.com.The jokes, for the most part, produce silence more than anything. I laughed at maybe three of the jokes, and chuckled at a few others. Tenacious D is only for a certain audience, of which I am not.This movie lags in numerous places, and this is where the worst jokes appear. And let me say that, when Black and Glass are not working off one another, they are completely lost on screen.All the songs in this movie is by and performed by Tenacious D. Many of the songs perfectly advance the storyline by describing their adventures at the time in the film. However, I felt that the songs sounded too similar to be told apart.Another problem with this film is that the language will turn off a lot of people. There are a lot of four-letter words in this film. There are also some drug references. I would not recommend this for children.Part of Tenacious D's schtick is that Black is in your face, and Glass stays in his shadows for the most part. This is how they are in this movie, and it doesn't really work. Now, this may have been part of the act, but I felt that Glass just didn't want to be there. In one scene, he performs his (background) lyrics at a party and he just can't work alone.Tenacious D are supposedly rock fans in real life, and have maybe two rock legends in the movie, I lost count because I was so bored with this film. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more rock legends and icons in the film. However, we don't get that.What we do get is a movie filled with completely lame jokes, lots of foul language, a lackluster script. You also get horrible acting, and an unoriginal story. However, you get some pretty good songs that pretty much sound the same.The story could have been promising, but many of the scenes appeared to have been added into the film at the last second. This is somewhat similar to The Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had a much bigger following -- and two songs on the Billboard music charts. Tenacious D only has a small following, with a few HBO specials under their belt. And, unlike The Blues Brothers, the comedy is not well thought out at all.If you are a hard core fan of Tenacious D, then I suggest you check it out. However, like most of the movie audience when this film was released to theaters, I would say avoid this one. Save your money on this one, folks.",2,2,7,7 August 2008
Back to the Future Part II," Continuing (and revisiting) the fun of the original
","'Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown' (Christopher Lloyd) arrives from the future seconds after coming back from the past to find 'Marty McFly' (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend 'Jennifer Parker' (Elisabeth Shue, who has taken over the role from Claudia Wells starting in this movie). 'Brown' informs them that there is a problem with their children in the future, and insists that they come with him.In the future, after 'Doc' renders 'Jennifer' unconscience when she begins to ask way too many questions in the excitement of being in the future, 'Doc' and 'Marty' find 'Marty Jr.' (Fox), who is a complete nerd, being harassed by 'Griff Tannen' (Thomas F. Wilson), the future grandson of 'Biff Tannen' (Wilson), who is the high school arch-rival of 'Marty's' father, 'George' (Jeffrey Weissman and, in footage from the original movie to show the original actor's face, Crispin Glover). After 'Marty' helps his nerdy, but look-alike son, with 'Griff' and his gang, he comes across an antiques store and purchases a magazine that lists sports results from 1950 to 2000.Eventually, the future version of 'Biff' gets his hand on the magazine and steals the magazine, and steals the DeLorean time machine to go back to visit his younger self in 1955.Now, 'Doc' and 'Marty' have to go back to 1955 again, get the magazine and avoid their other selves that are already there (from the first movie).This is one of the most original sequels ever made, as it perfectly inserts many scenes from the original -- many of which were re-shot at different angles. It is also one of the few where multiple actors are playing more than one character, even if the character is the same person. You get to see many versions of the same person in other words.The performances are pretty fun, especially when the movie is in the scenes set in the future. Not only are we introduced to new characters, we see the same actors playing these comical characters -- especially Fox, who plays two characters in the future -- 'Marty Jr.' and his sister, 'Marlene' (who gets very little screen time compared to 'Marty Jr.). It must have been difficult for the cast to create variations of the character they originated in the first movie.The special effects in this film are not very original, but still hold up for the most part. While watching, I only saw a few instances where the special effects have weaken over the years, and it was obvious that they were inserted during post-production.I was pretty disappointed in the future 'Hill Valley' for the most part. None of the vehicles looked authentic to me, and the clothing was fairly laughable with the choice of colors and design. There was some originality in the future -- the 'Jaws 19' marquee, the self-tying sneakers (with light-up Nike logos) and the famed 'Mattel Hoverboard.' The comedy is only worth some chuckles through out the entire movie. Some jokes are just rehash from the previous film, and are not set up well to the point that you don't expect it. However, at least one scene in the future is a nice rework of one of the more memorable scenes of the first movie.Make-up effects are not up to par in this movie. You get simple make-up effects to only fairly elaborate make-up effects. The 'aged' effects are not good in my opinion. It is obvious that the future version of 'Biff'. as well as the future version of 'Jennifer's' cleavage, are prosthetics (especially the cleavage, which looks more like rubber more than it does skin). Some performers even looked as if they had obvious hair dye jobs, instead of wigs.A lot of the music came from the original movie, with some new songs add in. I think only one song was used really well to set the tone of the scene, the rest were just there if you ask me.One thing that worked well, although it was a bit odd, was the scenes from the original movie re-shot from the point of view of 'Marty' and 'Doc.' If you notice, 'Marty's' father, 'George' is seen not looking at the camera, or his face is blurry due to being in the background of the scene where the principle characters are being shot. You are seeing a different actor in the role since Crispin Glover did not sign on to be in this movie, but you hear his voice from clips taken from the first movie.This film can get a bit confusing at times, due to the time paradox that 'Doc' explains to 'Marty.' Sometimes, you forget which version of the characters you are watching -- especially when another version is in the scene.This is a good movie for the entire family. The language, and violence is pretty mild, and the comedy is never crude or adult-oriented. The only thing I would suggest is that you watch the movies back-to-back.",7,0,1,20 February 2009
Shrek," Could've been better than it was
","'Shrek' (voiced by Mike Myers) is an ogre who loves the solitude of the swamp in which he lives. However, that solitude is disrupted when the fairy tale creatures in the area are forced into the swamp by 'Lord Farquaad' (voiced by John Lithgow), ruler of the nearby 'Duloc.' 'Shrek,' along with a talking donkey named 'Donkey' (voiced by Eddie Murphy), goes to complain to 'Faarquaad', who sends the two on a quest to save 'Princess Fiona' (voiced by Cameron Diaz; singing voice by Renee Sandstrom) lava-protected castle where she is being held against her will by a dragon.Eventually, the three escape, and it becomes obvious that 'Princess Fiona' and 'Shrek' are meant to be together. However, 'Shrek' wants to live a life of solitude, and 'Fiona' is hiding a secret that she is ashamed of.Now, the two have to learn what destiny has in store for the two, or they will live lives that weren't meant to be.Let me say first that this movie is far from perfect. First of all, the story presented is pretty weak and rushed. We don't really get to see when 'Shrek' and 'Donkey' really get to trust one another. It appeared to me that the two became friendly somewhere between a couple of scenes. I also think that there were just too many characters in the supporting cast.I did like how the performances were handled in this movie. The actors really brought the characters to life. Sometimes, I forgot that the actors were not on camera, and I don't believe that they were in the same room when they recorded their dialog.The movie is enhanced by the wonderful animation. In fact, the animation is simply amazing. Personally, I think the animation was even better on the silver screen than it was on television. The colors of the animation is simply beautiful, and the scenery really looked three-dimensional. The use of colors was perfect through the entire movie.Realism, in my opinion, is the only downfall in computer animation. Human skin looks more like rubber than actual skin. And when it comes to realistic looking hair or fur, it misses the mark. 'Donkey's' hair just doesn't look real to me.Another downfall is that much of the humor is not for young children. In fact, there is some language that isn't for children in this movie either. If I remember correctly, the movie was marketed as a family movie. It really isn't thanks to some jokes and language. These jokes would go over younger children's heads, and would make older children laugh when it comes to bodily function jokes. But, some references are certainly targeted to the adults in the audience.Another fun aspect of this movie is the references to other movies, and numerous fairy tales. Some movie references I didn't notice, but did notice a particular special effect that everybody has seen from a certain sci-fi franchise starring Keanu Reeves.As for the soundtrack, I can't recall one original song or musical piece in this movie. All the songs are ones you heard before, including a really good cover of a classic Monkees song. I'm not really sure if the songs fit into the scenes, but it was fun hearing them.I can only say that you should watch this on HBO on a rainy day. It's cute, but not that cute.",5,2,5,2 September 2009
Saints and Soldiers," Not your typical war movie
","Survivors of a military massacre during World War II are in the worse case scenario; no rations, behind enemy lines, exhausted and starved.The four (Corbin Allred, Peter Asle Holden, Larry Bagby and Alexander Polinsky) come close to being captured many times while trying to get into allied territory. They finally arrive at a home where the owner lets them have some refuge, after coming across a British soldier (Kirby Hayborne). She also allows a German soldier, who happened to have met one of the Americans before the war.Now the soldiers, one of which is carrying vital information, have to get back to allied territory or die.This is not your typical war movie. Mostly because the story focuses on the relationships between the soldiers. There are battle scenes in this movie, but they're spread out through out the movie.The battle scenes are pretty authentic. Loud, with lots of action. The blood shed is fairly tame, and there's nothing gory. One of the main characters is a medic, and has to deal with some bad wounds. However, the wounds are not graphic.The strongest aspect of this movie is the performances of the main cast. The main cast is simply fantastic. You actually feel as if you are looking at people who have bonded after a long time, under intense circumstances. Their on-screen chemistry is one of the best I've seen recently. I can't say that one of the actors stood out from the rest, only because they are all great in their roles. Not one of them were unbelievable.The clothing was very authentic looking. In fact, the clothing, as well as weaponry and vehicles were provided by WWII collectors. Also, re-en-actors were used in many battle scenes.Music in this movie is used nicely. Many musical pieces are used nicely to enhance the scene. I can't remember any musical pieces though.Some people may have a problem with the cast being a group of unknowns. This movie is a low-budget independent film, so a big name star was unattainable. However, this cast is fantastic in this film, and you quickly forget that you don't know these actors.I would suggest that parents not allow younger children see this movie. There is some violence, and one character is suffering from battle fatigue which kids may not comprehend. There is no swearing in this film, with the exception of an era racial slur against Germans.I watched this movie over on Hulu, where you could check it out on as well. However, if your connection is too slow to stream video, and happen across this film, check it out -- if your first couple of choices are not available. I wouldn't Netflix this, only because of the wait if you already have a long list for the company to choose from.",8,1,4,17 September 2009
Bull Durham," Strikes out on laughs
","In Durham, North Carolina, the minor league baseball team, the Durham Bulls, are having a horrible season. However, things may be looking up for the team as they have signed a promising rookie pitcher, 'Ebby Calvin LaLoosh (Tim Robbins).The team hires a catcher by the name of 'Crash Davis' (Kevin Costner), who is nearing the end of his professional baseball career in the minors in a career that included three weeks in the major leagues (or 'the show', as it is known in the minors), to teach the rookie. 'LaLoosh' also gets some coaching by well-known groupie, 'Annie Savoy' (Susan Sarandon), who hooks up with a player for the season, which many consider a good thing due to her unusual coaching ways in the sport she legitimately loves.Although 'Annie' has picked 'LaLoosh', whom she gives the nickname 'Nuke' to, it is getting quite obvious that she is falling for 'Crash', who is pretty much her intellectual equal.Now, the two have to battle over the same player, as they try not to act on their attraction for one another.This is suppose to be a comedy right? Well, where were the laughs? I didn't laugh at all, at any of the jokes. I probably only slightly chuckled at a couple of jokes through the entire movie. The jokes fell completely flat in this movie.Another thing I noticed in this movie is that it lagged the entire length of the film. The movie is very slow, and pretty boring. Part of the bordom is thanks to the supporting cast.The supporting cast is completely boring. Not one advance the story, nor do they add to the movie. In fact, the supporting cast subplots do not go anywhere at all. They aren't even developed as much as the three main characters ('Nuke,' 'Annie' and 'Crash').In fact, the main characters chemistry wasn't that great. Although the performers were good in their roles, there was very little spark between them. I also thought that they had their moments together.If I'm not mistaken, this is the movie where Sarandon and Robbins became an item. I felt that their on-screen chemistry was a bit weak, especially when she started going after 'Crash.' And I felt no romantic spark between 'Annie' and 'Crash.' I also found the music was pretty boring. Most of the songs were a little old, to the point that the youngest members of the (adult) audience would not know them. I found that the music didn't really enhance the scenes at all.I was also unimpressed with the sets used in the movie. 'Annie's' home was filled with junk, and had way too much of it. I was also disappointed in the baseball scenes.The scenes on the diamond were just OK. Some had 'Crash' teach 'Nuke' some lessons, while some were just game play. I was not impressed with the game play scenes. None of the plays were too exciting, and just didn't do anything to the movie except remind you that this is a movie surrounding a minor league baseball season.This movie is not for children, especially young ones. There is a lot of sexually-oriented language and some sexual situations. There is some sexual innuendo as well.I've read that this movie is one of the greatest sports movies of all time. However, it appeared that baseball was not that major in the story itself.Even the wardrobes were pretty boring. I really could not tell when this movie was suppose to take place. 'Annie's' outfits looked to be about 30 years older than the rest of the cast's outfits.In my opinion, this is certainly not the classic sports movie that people say it is. I found it boring, and suggest that you see it on regular TV where it is edited for content and time aloud. You won't miss too much.",3,9,21,25 February 2009
Tarzan," A pretty fun movie
","Based on the famous series of novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 – March 19, 1950), Disney has come up with a pretty entertaining adaptation of the beloved literary character.The first thing I must talk about is the animation. Disney has perfectly blended classic animation with computer animation. The computer animation enhances the classic animation with movement drawings couldn't do. In many scenes, 'Tarzan' (child voiced by Alex D. Lintz; adult voiced by Tony Goldwyn) is sliding on large tree branches rapidly. In the classic animation style, they would not have been successful in 'following' 'Tarzan' through the trees as well as they could with computer animation due to the rapid movement.There are very few dark colors in the scenery. In fact, the only dark colors were used for the gorillas, shadowing and human hair. Most of the colors are light gray, lots of green (it is in a jungle) and other brighter colors.There are some pretty good performances in this film. However, none really stood out in my opinion. I was not that impressed with some supporting characters, as they had little screen time and thus had no time to develop. Rosie O'Donnell was a delight as 'Terk,' who was 'Tarzan's' best gorilla friend.If you ask me, they really missed the mark to make a memorable villain in this film. They had two chances, but killed one, and just did a horrible job making a human villain.As for music, which Disney is known for, there isn't a lot performed on screen by characters like in previous movies. In fact, characters burst into two songs. The rest of the soundtrack is done mainly by Grammy and Academy Award-winning Phil Collins. The songs by Collins is easily a lot more memorable than the rest of the musical score. In fact, all I really can remember is Collins songs. However, the Collins songs, which he wrote and performed, is not as memorable as some of the classic songs Disney is known for. Therefore, if you hear the songs by Collins, you won't be catching yourself singing these tunes, nor will you think of the movie when you hear the songs. The songs did fit well into scenes though.The movie is well paced, however I did think the story was really rushed due to the 89 minute length of the film. They really rushed the part where 'Jane' (voiced by Minnie Driver) and the team she was with tried to bring 'Tarzan' back to civilization with some of the animal characters as prizes. They also did a pretty good job with the famed relationship between 'Jane' and Tarzan. If this movie was a little longer, they really could have worked on many scenes, character development and the relationships between the characters. After seeing this movie, I am almost certain they made the animated television series based on this movie to better explore the relationships in the movie.If you ask me, this is almost a Disney classic. But, in my opinion, it barely misses the mark to be up there with 'Snow White' and others touched by Disney's magic.",7,2,2,4 September 2009
Happy Feet," Falls apart when the environmental message appears
","In Antarctica, a colony of Emperor Penguins are living peacefully. A female penguin named 'Norma Jean' (voiced by Nicole Kidman) finds a mate named 'Memphis' (voiced by Hugh Jackman) by singing a 'heartsong' ('Kiss' by Prince), to which 'Memphis' responds with his own 'heartsong ('Heartbreak Hotel' by 'The King of Rock 'n' Roll' Elvis Presley). The two hatch a child named 'Mumbles' (voiced by EG Daily).'Mumbles' is not your typical penguin, as he is unable to carry a 'heartsong' if it had handles on it. He becomes an outcast, but a female named 'Gloria' (voiced by Alyssa Shafer) becomes the only penguin who shows him a shred of respect. It is also obvious that 'Mumbles' has feeling for the female penguin.Years later, the fish population the penguins live off of is dying out. And 'Mumbles' goes on an adventure to find out just exactly what is happening with their food.But, what he finds not only affects his colony, but other species he comes across on his adventure and what he learns are 'aliens' (humans).The first thing I have to say is that the animation is pretty good. The characters move realistically, and they do get the smallest detail in the look of the character. The problem is that, thanks to the location the movie takes place, there is just too much white. You get a few shades of blue, some blacks and grays, and a little yellow and brown. But, there is just too much white, and the scenery is pretty boring.Like I said, the characters are designed nicely. The actors enhance the characters with their performances. Fortunately, some actors were able to provide multiple voices for different characters. One that stands out is Robin Williams, who provides a voice for about three characters -- including the narrator, which is not in the movie that much.For the majority of the movie, you get some popular tunes from the last 40 years. Many of the songs are used fairly well to set up scenes. Those who sing the songs do a pretty good job with the covers. However, Prince, who provides at least one original tune, should have been used to perform his hit 'Kiss', which 'Norma Jean' uses as her 'heartsong'. Unlike recent movies I've seen, the soundtrack is memorable thanks to the use of many well known songs. I would have liked to have seen a few more original songs to help advance the mood of movie.And speaking of the movie's mood, it changes when the environmental message comes into light. This is when the movie completely falls apart. In my opinion, the movie makers completely forgot to develop characters and story lines that were presented earlier in the film. For example, instead of 'Gloria' going with 'Mumbles,' she stays with the colony. They completely missed a chance to advance the blossoming romance between the two. Other characters, who are introduced as the environmental message begins to appear, have no chance of development at all.Another thing that is wrong with this movie is that this really isn't for a young audience. You get some adult humor that should slip past children, and some larger species of Antarctic animals chasing and almost killing a main character.As for my recommendation, I am somewhere between Yes and No. Prior to the environmental message, I would say yes, but only for a rainy day movie. After the environmental message appears, I can't recommend it.",4,0,2,8 August 2008
