United 93," Incredible Film, Incredible Tribute
","This film is simply phenomenal. I went into the movie a little unsure of what to expect, but trust me it is worth every penny.And I would also like to confirm that the theater was silent as this movie ended. It was probably the most silence I have ever heard. The movie was moving, but the silence that preceded and followed was even more moving.This movie needs to be seen. If you object to this film, see it anyway. The beauty in this film lies not on lingering on the events of 9/11, but attempting to PORTRAY HUMAN EMOTION in a situation that is unimaginable.10/10. An excellent masterpiece that will stand the test of time.We remember those lost on that day, and this film goes above and beyond to show respect and gratitude to those Americans that gave their lives for a country they believed in. This is the definition of heroism.INCREDIBLE! BRAVO!",10,18,40,29 April 2006
Valkyrie," What a Surprise! Fantastic Film!
","I was initially extremely skeptical due to the film's negative reception from film critics. I was also extremely skeptical of Tom Cruise, not to mention the film itself. I was completely turned off by the multiple times this film's release date was bumped back. This is surely a sign of a struggling, failing film, right? No. I am pleased to report that the film was absolutely fantastic. It completely delivered and left me satisfied - and thinking - for days after the viewing.The supporting cast is fantastic - many of the actors are actual Germans who act in German film (see 'Downfall,' etc.). Tom Cruise's performance is potent and believable. All of the characters seem to 'just work' on screen together. The characters and the performances all seem to contribute to an unrelenting sense of tension throughout the film.Although the outcome of the plot is well known, I found myself clenching my fists and cheering for the 'good guys' throughout the entire film. You cannot help but find yourself identifying with the emotions and tensions on screen. There are many points during the film where the tension becomes almost too much to bear. It's times like these when you know you've found a good film - a good thriller - and a good drama. The film delivers fully in every aspect.The film even delivers in the historical accuracy arena - it is obvious that much work went into portraying the story in a historically accurate light. If you're a nitpicker, you're bound to find inaccuracies in any film; however, if you're a history buff that enjoys an excellent reenactment with a nice mix of drama, this film is for you.I would ignore the critics on this one - I think Tom Cruise has left a sour taste in their mouths. Instead, give this film a try and I promise you won't be disappointed.Valkyrie is a well-rounded, tense drama that leaves the viewer thinking long after the film is over. This may be the film that revives Tom Cruise's career. It certainly is an excellent World War II film that can stand up there with the best in the genre.",8,2,3,2 January 2009
