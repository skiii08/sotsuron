The Ring," Scared me Silly!
","Wow this movie was so scary! I couldn't believe the difference between this one and the ring 2! I first saw the ring 2 and I thought it was OK, but this one was excellent! The story too was a lot better then the sequel. I was literally hiding behind the covers. Now that I've seen the ring, I think the ring 2 isn't very good. I wouldn't go to see the ring 2, the ring is so good it explains everything. The story is about a 16 year old girl who dies mysteriously after seeing a tape. There are rumors about the tape, if you watch it you'll die after 7 days. All of the girls friends who watched die too. The girls mother asks Rachel Keller a reporter and family member to investigate her daughters death. Rachel watches the tape and gets more and more convinced the tape really kills people after watching the tape. Rachel has to race against the time to prevent herself, her child and her ex from dying!Any way I would really recommend watching this movies, it's really good and you'll really be creaped out!",7,1,2,9 October 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," Great movie
",I first saw this movie with a friend a couple of years ago and I really enjoyed it now seeing it again after so long I remember why I liked it so much. I've actually got it on DVD now.The movie is about Bridget Jones a 30 something single woman struggling to find a good boyfriend. She thinks she finds the perfect man and for a couple of weeks she's really happy she thinks she's got it all but unfortunately Daniel isn't as perfect as he seems and they break up and she depressed again. But then she finds there's some one else interested in her.This movie is really funny! The cast is great Rene Zelweger is perfect as Bridget Jones. She does the accent really good and actually I prefer her with it. Some how she really uses her voice differently when she speaks with her 'real' American accent. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are really good in it too.I would recommend this movie to any one.,8,2,3,10 August 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Very funny!
","This movie was soooo funny! I hadn't really seen Steve Carell in other movies only in Bruce Allmighty. He was funny in that and in this movie too. The story begins with Andy being asked by his co-workers to play poker with them. He's only ever played poker on the internet, he ends up winning everything. During the game the guys boast about sex and they ask Andy to tell them a great sex story. So he tries it saying that womens breasts feel like sand! So they find out he's a virgin and make it there mission to deflower him.It was a really funny movie, everybody in the cinema was laughing and it was packed! I think it is funny for all ages, well for everybody above 12.",7,0,2,9 October 2005
