The Avengers," One of the best superhero films ever made!
","The Avengers is everything you would want from a superhero team up movie. The characters are well written, the story is phenomenal, the action sequences are amazing, and Loki is one of the best villains in the MCU. Definitely one of the best superhero movies of all time!",10,1,1,18 June 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Mediocre but not terrible
","The Incredible Hulk is a very mediocre film and my least favorite film in the MCU. The plot is confusing, the CGI is bad, and the film is boring at times. But it does have solid acting, the action is entertaining, but overall The Incredible Hulk is a mixed bag for me.",5,0,2,18 June 2019
Iron Man 3," Okay, but should've been better
","Iron Man 3 could've been the best Iron Man film and one of the best movies in the MCU. And it was fine, but it was kind of underwhelming, just a little underwhelming. There are far too many plot points just like Iron Man 2, I hated the mandarin twist and I didn't like the 'real' mandarin villain. However this film is pretty watchable and I love the action scenes and Robert Downey Jr. of course shines again. I also really like the scenes and narrative of Tony Stark dealing with PTSD. It felt pretty relatable. But overall, Iron Man 3 is okay, but it should've been better.",7,0,0,18 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Not as bad as people say it is
","Captain Marvel isn't actually that bad as people say it is, it's actually pretty good. Brie Larson is great as Captain Marvel and she fits the role perfectly. And Brie Larson's chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson was good as well. Captain Marvel is also an interesting fish out of water type character. The story is fine but not great. The second act however was very boring. But overall Captain Marvel is a pretty solid MCU flick and it isn't as bad as people say it is.",7,3,8,19 June 2019
Iron Man 2," Forgettable, but I don't hate it
","Iron Man 2 is one of the more forgettable movies in the MCU in my opinion. The villains are forgettable, the plot is meh, and they shove too much stuff down the audiences throat in order to set up The Avengers. However Robert Downey Jr. and Sam Rockwell are fantastic in this film and I enjoy the third act a lot. I also like the action scenes as well but overall this film is kinda disappointing coming off the first Iron Man film which was great.",5,0,0,18 June 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Super funny!
","Thor Ragnarok is the Thor film that we needed. Coming off of the mediocre Thor The Dark World, I didn't know if this film would be that great. And I was very satisfied with this movie. The first two films seemed a tad bit too dark. But this film was taken into a more colorful and light-hearted direction. This film is really funny, the action was very entertaining, but most importantly, this film made Thor a more likable character. However I do think that Jeff Goldblum was underused though. Overall Thor Ragnarok is great and super funny.",9,1,8,19 June 2019
The Terminator," One of the best sci-fi/action movies!
",This movie is very quotable and iconic. With thrilling action sequences and really fast pacing. Arnold is amazing as the t-800 and this movie is also amazing.,10,0,2,9 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Tom Holland shines as Spider-Man AND Peter Parker
","Spider-Man Homecoming is a great Spider-Man movie and a great MCU movie and a great movie in general. I like how they made this film more of a teen comedy, it really works well. Tom Holland is not only a great Spider-Man but also a great Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire was a great Peter Parker but not a great Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield was a great Spider-Man but not a great Peter Parker. But Tom Holland is both. Vulture is also a great villain as well. One of my nitpicks with the film is that the spidey sense doesn't seem to be present. And it can be a bit predictable at times as well. Overall Spider-Man Homecoming is a great Spider-Man film and a great MCU film.",9,21,32,19 June 2019
Alien," Ridley Scott's best movie!
",Alien is a sci-fi horror classic that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The suspense and the fear are there and that iconic chestburster scene is so scary and iconic. The final fight at the end of the movie is very suspenseful and keeps you guessing. Ridley Scott is one of the best directors of our time.,10,0,2,9 August 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," One of the best movies in the MCU!
","Captain America The Winter Soldier is a fantastic MCU film and a fantastic film in general. I love how the Russo brothers made this movie a dark and gritty political thriller. The story is amazing, the characters are well written, and the winter soldier is one of the great conflicted types of villains. The fighting choreography is flawless, and this film can really tug on your heartstrings at times as well. The Winter soldier is one of the best movies in the MCU!",10,3,6,19 June 2019
Doctor Strange," A great origin story!
","Doctor Strange is one of the more underrated MCU flicks. The writing is very solid, Benedict Cumberbatch is great and he really fits the role of doctor strange. The CGI and effects are great. However the villain in this film is very forgettable. And the pacing can be slow at times. But overall, Doctor Strange is a great origin story.",8,1,1,19 June 2019
Ant-Man," Another pleasant surprise in the MCU.
","I thought the premise of Ant-Man was a joke when I first heard of it. But then I thought about Guardians Of The Galaxy and what I thought about the premise at first for that film and I ended up loving it. And when I first saw Ant-Man. I enjoyed the film. Paul Rudd is pretty charismatic in this film. And Michael Pena was hilarious in this movie. The action scenes are fun to watch as well. However the villain, hornet, is pretty forgettable. It doesn't really make sense why he's evil because it isn't explained well. So overall, Ant-Man is another pleasant surprise in the MCU.",8,0,0,19 June 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Pretty fun MCU flick.
","Captain America The First Avenger is a pretty fun entry in the MCU. The character development is good, I like the action scenes. And I do think that red skull is a pretty underrated villain. However the pacing is kind of off. And the film can feel a bit rushed at times. Overall The First Avenger is a fun MCU flick.",8,2,2,18 June 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger do it again!
",This is not only the best action movie of all time but one of the best sci-fi movies of all time! T2 improves on so many levels that I can't cover all of them in one review. Dispite this movie being over 2 1/2 hours this movie is pretty fast paced. The t-1000 is one of my favorite villains and the cgi used for the t-1000 looks good dispite this movie being released in 1991. One of james Cameron's best movies,10,0,3,9 August 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Absolutely amazing!
",Captain America Civil War is one of my favorite movies in the MCU and is one of the best comic book films of all time. The writing is great and the whole conflict is very interesting. I absolutely adore the airport fight scene. Spider-Man and Black Panther are great additions to the MCU as well. I also love the ending to this film as well. Captain America Civil War is absolutely amazing!,10,0,2,19 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Not only the best comic book film ever, but a MASTERPIECE!
","Avengers Endgame is not only better than Avengers Infinity War, this film is better than The Dark Knight! Avengers Endgame is also one of the best movies I have ever seen! It's very emotional and it's satisfying. The storytelling is top notch. And the third act is so emotional and it almost made me cry. And the ending of this film is very bittersweet. The avengers assemble scene is a dream come true with everyone that was dusted in Infinity War coming back. Captain America lifting Mjolnir was a great twist. And Iron Man's sacrifice was amazing and emotional. I also loved the fat Thor story arc and it really made sense from a storytelling point of view. Endgame is the perfect ending to the MCU's infinity saga. This film has also made me appreciate infinity war even more. Not only is Endgame the best comic book film ever, but it is a MASTERPIECE!",10,2,5,19 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Absolutely PHENOMENAL!
","Avengers Infinity War is the definition of awesomeness! This film made Thanos my all time favorite Marvel villain. Thanos isn't a villain that wanted to destroy humanity just for the sake of destroying humanity, he wanted to destroy half of it because he feared overpopulation. You can actually see where he's coming from. I love how they made this film a lot more darker and grittier than the previous installments. It really works well. This film is also very emotional as well. And of course it also had a very sad ending where black panther, falcon, the guardians of the galaxy except for rocket, doctor strange, Bucky, and of corse spider-man turn to dust. Overall, Avengers Infinity War is absolutely PHENOMENAL!",10,0,0,19 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This movie is one of the best Star Wars movies yet, ignore the hate!!
",I love this movie! This movie has some of the greatest scenes in the film like the throne room scene. Mark Hamil was great reprising his role as Luke Skywalker. This had some of the best action in all of Star Wars and the characters were much improved. The performances were top shelf and better than TFA's performances. Also people hate on TLJ because there stupid theories about snoke and Rey's parents didn't happen because snoke gets cut in half and Rey's parents are nobody's. Also Luke's sacrifice was awesome and completely shocking so ignore the hate and keep watching Star Wars!,9,5,35,9 August 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," A pleasant surprise!
","When I first heard of the premise of Guardians Of The Galaxy, I thought the premise was a joke at first. But when I first saw it in theaters, I was pleasantly surprised! This film is hilarious, heartwarming, and fun. The characters are well written and relatable, the story is very clever as well. And I loved how they fitted 70s and 80s pop songs into a plenty of scenes. Guardians Of The Galaxy is a pleasant surprise!",10,1,2,19 June 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Pretty good but kind of underwhelming.
","Avengers Age Of Ultron was my second most anticipated film of 2015 behind The Force Awakens. I had very high expectations for this film based on how good the MCU was going. And I like Age Of Ultron, I think it's a fun movie. But the writing for Ultron could've been better. And the whole Black widow and hulk romance didn't make sense since in the first Avengers film, she was terrified of hulk. It would've made more sense if there was a Black widow and Hawkeye romance but then came the twist where it turns out that Hawkeye has a secret family. And not to mention why did they kill off Quicksilver after one movie? It would've made more sense if they saved his death for civil war and gave him some more character development but they just killed him after one movie. But I love the action scenes and the humor is funny. The dialogue is also on point. I love the final battle as well. And of course you still have the well written characters from the first Avengers film. So Avengers Age Of Ultron is pretty good but kind of underwhelming.",7,0,1,19 June 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A great sequel but not as good as the first.
","Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a really good sequel. I like how the story focuses a lot more the on characters. This movie is really funny and heartfelt just like the first one. The writing is also pretty good and the effects are great. However this film can be predictable at times. And sometimes the pacing is slow. But overall, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great sequel but not as good as the first.",8,2,2,19 June 2019
Thor," Not bad but pretty meh
","Thor is a pretty meh MCU flick. The Asgard scenes in this film are pretty great. However when the setting switches to earth, the tone seems all over the place and that's where the film gets dragged down. However the action scenes are cool, Chris Hemsworth is likable as Thor, and Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as Odin. So overall, Thor isn't a bad movie, but it's a pretty meh movie.",6,0,2,26 June 2019
Black Panther," Another great MCU film! But the some of the CGI is awful
","Black Panther is really good. The story is great, the characters are well written, and Kilmonger is my third favorite MCU villain behind Loki and Thanos. I liked how serious this film actually was as well. However some of the CGI particularly toward the final battle looks HORRIBLE. Some of the CGI looks almost as bad if not worse than the CGI in Justice League. And I didn't like the 'what are those' joke. But overall, Black Panther is another great MCU film.",9,2,6,19 June 2019
Iron Man," The one that started it all.
","Iron man is a great movie with great acting especially from Robert Downey Jr., great character development and thrilling action. If this film bombed at the box office, we wouldn't have this amazing marvel cinematic universe today.",9,0,1,18 June 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Boring and mediocre
","Thor The Dark World is a very boring MCU flick. The villain is boring and forgettable, the plot is meh, and the scenes on earth are very uninteresting. However the action sequences are fun and the special effects are good, and Anthony Hopkins is fantastic in this film. But overall Thor The Dark World is boring and mediocre.",5,1,1,18 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Amazing film! Lived up to the hype!
","Star Wars the force awakens is probably the most anticipated film of all time. And it was amazing! A lot of people criticize the force awakens for being a retread of a new hope. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film all Star Wars movies are similar to each other. The new characters in this film are great. And I loved the return of Han, Leia, and Luke. Even though Luke was there for only 10 seconds. The movie also had a cool villain, Kylo Ren. He's a conflicted villain with an awesome character arc. The scene where he kills Han Solo was pretty emotional too. So the force awakens is a great film and it revived the franchise.",9,4,47,11 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that started George Lucas's legendary saga
","When Star Wars was released in 1977 it was the biggest event in cinema history. Star Wars also lead to two sequels to form a trilogy known as the original trilogy. But this movie is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made and one of the best movies ever made. Star Wars has so many iconic momments, characters, etc. George Lucas brought us the best movie franchise of all time. If you haven't seen the Star Wars movies then do yourself a favor and see them.",10,1,1,9 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My favorite movie of all time!
",The empire strikes back took everything from it's predecessor and made it even better. This movie has the characters from the last movie and vastly improved them while introducing new characters. The empire strikes back has a lot more iconic momments and an iconic twist. And the empire strikes back is hands down My favorite Star Wars movie and my favorite movie of all time!,10,0,0,9 August 2018
