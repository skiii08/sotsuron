It," Overrated and uninspired chlichefest
","This movie is painfully boring and way too long, the structure is completely meaningless nonesense (2 climaxes seperated by more boring filler).
The first half stands out featuring about 20 different cliches and cringeworthy kids dialogue.
Pennywise is not scary at all and his wiggling and cgi teeth make me laugh (which is bad for a horror film)My advice would be watching the opening scene on youtube and be done with it.3/10 uninsprired and a wate of time",3,2,2,21 September 2019
