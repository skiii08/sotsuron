The Equalizer," Are there Police Advisors to make the movie realistic?
","In the scene when Detective Masters (David Harbour), hears the alarm sounding on his car, he walks out the door to his bedroom and checks his revolver for bullets.
This is where an advisor is needed: all of the bullets have dimples in the primers, indicating that they have all been fired, so he is actually taking a useless handgun, unless he throws it for protection.",5,0,0,15 March 2019
