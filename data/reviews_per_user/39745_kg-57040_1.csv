It," Why I'm not giving it a 10 out of 10
","Firstly, let me say, I am a huge Stephen King fan and a constant reader since I was 11 or 12 years old. IT was one of the very first books I read and one of the first horror movies I watched. I actually watched the original before going to the cinema to see the new one and I was not disappointed to see that they had kept very much to the original story and even surprised me when they stayed in the original era rather than modernising it. However, call me nostalgic, but it was just not the same without Tim Curry and that's why I can't give it 10/10. Silly to some, maybe but I'm sure there's other 'elders' like me who felt the same. Other than that, the kids acting was 10/10, storyline 10/10, dialogue 10/10, clown acting 8/10, it was just a bit too much at times but overall it has left me anxiously anticipating the final chapter.",9,6,13,12 September 2017
