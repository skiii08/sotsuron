It," Loved every minute of it
","To start off my review I'd like everyone to know I'm a huge Stephen King fan. I love every Stephen King book I've ever read and there is NOTHING quite like an excellent Stephen King film adaptation and this is one of those great film adaptations. What I love so much about IT is that it's a horror film while remaining a comedy and while still focusing on the bigger story line. IT was never a story about a killer clown, but a bunch of kids who banded together for a huge adventure. I loved that the movie gave the audience some excellent scares while still remaining authentic to the comedy of the book. In my opinion the highlight of this film was the banter between the kids and the perfect delivery of one liners by Finn Wolfhard. That kid seriously stole the show. I also liked that there were some moments that felt a little campy and some truly horrifying moments because it made the movie feel more realistic. Its hard to make a horror movie feel authentic, but this film was exactly that. I have high expectations for chapter 2.",8,7,16,8 September 2017
Get Out," Did I See The Same Movie?
","Did I see the same movie everyone else did? When I saw the trailer for this movie a few months back I really didn't plan on seeing it because I thought it looked like every other horror movie and there wouldn't be anything special about it. Then it came out and got raving reviews and I felt like I had to see it. So I saw it and I was a bit disappointed. I loved the first half of the movie, but I kind of felt like the second half missed the mark. I thought the comedy aspect was a little dull and I didn't think the jokes were great. I actually couldn't really tell if the whole movie was a big joke or not. But one thing this movie did do was keep me entertained. The whole movie I was wondering what was going to happen next and what was happening. I didn't think about anything outside the theater and I was completely focused and entertained by the movie, which is what a movie is suppose to do! I would recommend this movie, I thought it was really good, but I didn't think it deserved a 10 star review or that it was the best horror movie of all time. 6.5 stars!",8,8,20,5 March 2017
Midsommar," See Midsommar in Theaters
","I had the opportunity to see Midsommar at an early screening and while I think the film could end up being divisive among movie-goers, I still think it is worth your time.
I'm not 100% sold on this film, but I did enjoy it. It was intriguing and very beautiful. For me the highlights of the film were the cinematography, short composition, sound editing, and sound mixing. In terms of sound I honestly feel this movie is Oscar worthy. Florence Pugh also deserves some recognition. She carried the whole film on her back and that shouldn't be overlooked. Her acting was spot on and completely believable. I loved it and I loved her.
My main problem wasn't the completely unsettling events that took place throughout the movie, but that the storylines of the main characters felt a bit weak and took a back seat. I think I would have cared more about where the film went if we had a better understanding of the characters. I felt there was no clear character development happening.
Whether you love this film or hate it I think it's worth the watch. At the very least it's better than giving your money to a remake or a sequel.",8,12,23,3 July 2019
Arrival," It wasn't perfect, but an incredible movie all the same
","I saw this a few months after this came out and my expectations weren't too high because of all of the mixed reviews, but I loved this film. If you are a die hard si fi fan you probably won't love this just because this is more of a si fi/mystery/drama mix. What I loved about this film was the mystery and creativity. This wasn't your standard alien movie and there was a lot of depth to it. The cinematography was incredible, I mean absolute eye candy. The score was beautiful and intricate. And Amy Adams performance was truly show stopping. Not to mention the incredible plot twist. The only thing I didn't like about this was that it was a little slow, but after the first 20-30 minutes the movie really takes off and draws you in. This movie was a showstopper, I highly recommend it.",8,0,3,20 February 2017
Mother!," Set your expectations lower...no even lower.
","I went into mother with high expectations. Its a star studded cast with an incredible director and creative team behind it, but this show honestly sucked. It started out as a snooze fest. The cinematography was excellent and there were some creative shots, but for the most part it was pretty boring. And then came the house guests. Oh boy. The whole story line was just obnoxious. I hated every character. You have Michelle Phiffer who is a horrible human, Ed Harris who is off his rocker, and Jennifer Lawrence who plays the submissive housewife who takes all of their crap. She doesn't stand up for herself or to her husband and it drove me NUTS. I wanted to put my arms through the screen and shake Jennifer Lawrence the whole time and tell her to stand up for herself! After the house guests leave the story became absolutely crazy. Not crazy in a good way. Crazy in a 'why am I sitting here watching this film' way. While I understood the film in the end, there was absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about this story line to me. About midway through the movie I turned to my friend and said 'maybe we should just leave', but we decided to stay and I truly regret that decision. The last half of the movie was utter chaos with no light at the end of the tunnel. I felt this entire movie had no sense of direction. The ending was artsy, but totally bazaar and there was truly not a single moment of this film that I enjoyed. I didn't give it a 1/10 because of the cinematography and creativity, but if it weren't for those things this would have gotten a 1. I HATED it. Save your money on this chaotic 'psychological thriller' and go see IT instead. I promise you aren't missing anything with this mother of a dozy.",1,75,148,14 September 2017
