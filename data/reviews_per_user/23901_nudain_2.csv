Sucker Punch," This film proves Shakespeare wrong
","You're probably all familiar with the quote, 'that which we call a Rose, by any other name would still smell as sweet.' Well, this film has proved the big man wrong.This is the filmic equivalent of a gorgeous pile of sh*t.I'm not sure if I stole this from anyone or if I coined it myself, but my friends and I have a term for stuff like this; good rubbish.You must see this film, but it's awful. Beautifully, beautifully awful.I do think the site should relax the 10 line / 1000 word minimum on certain films; if the director couldn't be bothered to come up with a thoughtful, coherent plot then why should us amateurs be forced to come up with a thoughtful, coherent comment.",4,5,13,21 June 2011
The Expendables," It's a good film, not a great film.
","I've given this a five as it's a fairly painless way to spend 100 minutes. Half-way through the film as they're flying back to the island Sly flicks on the aeroplane's autopilot system. There was no point to this scene - unless another scene of him giving a talk to the rest of the team on the plane ended on the cutting room floor - other than to maybe signify that from here on in you can check your brain at the door, it's action-film-by-numbers-time now. The only other big complaint in the truly awful CGI that's used; at times I felt like I was playing Resident Evil again. But hey, Sly and Jason worked well together, and it's always nice to see Bruce on screen again, if only for two minutes.",5,5,11,30 September 2010
