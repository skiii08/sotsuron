Requiem for a Dream," You won't know what, or how, to feel after seeing this
","Requiem For A Dream takes you to an underworld filled with drugs, depression and despair. It brings you into the lives of four very sad people: Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans).  All Sara wants to do is to be loved. Loved by anyone who will love her. She will do anything to take her mind off the loneliness that she feels, so she goes on a diet. She gets hooked on the diet pills that have been prescribed to her, and starts to free fall into a nightmare.  Her son, Harry and his beautiful girlfriend Marion, want to open a shop. All they want is to be happy. But because of their drug addiction, their dreams slowly fade away.  Tyrone is Harry's best friend.  All he yearns for is his mother's love. He dreams about it all day, and takes heroin to fuel these dreams. Four regular people, who's live's take a sharp turn.There is no way to describe Requiem For A Dream other than saying it is a masterpiece. The emotions that go through you while watching this film are extreme. I have always been a fan of Ellen Byrstyn, but have never seen her pure talent until this film. Her performance can be compared to no one. It is one of the greatest in the history of cinema. The supporting cast is also exceptional. Especially Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans, who now proved he could hold his own in a dramatic role. Never has a movie shown what drug addiction can do to you like Requiem For A Dream has. It is so real and intense that sensitive viewers may not choose to watch this.
Requiem For A Dream is by far, one of the greatest films ever made. By the end of the film it will have torn through you and you won't know what, or, how to feel. But that is exactly what the creators of Requiem For A Dream were going for.A masterpiece all cinema! There is really nothing I can say that could do justice to the wonder of this movie. 10 out of 10!",Null,0,1,14 June 2003
Gangs of New York," What has Scorsese created? --- Nothing spectacular at all
","Back in December, I couldn't wait for this film to be released. When I finally went to see it with a friend of mine, I just knew it was going to be worth the wait. . . but, sadly, I was wrong. This movie could have turned out as an absolute masterpiece, but it was butchard. I'll break it down:I had absolutly no complaints about the acting. It was, indeed, supurb. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful. Though, I was expecting so much more from Daniel Day-Lewis. The way everyone was talking about him, saying that is was a preformance that will never be forgotten. I forgot it right when I left the theater. I am not saying that he did a bad job, but certainly did not deserve awards.The screenplay is the solid basis of a movie. Without a good script, you will not have a good movie (regardless of who is directing it.) Gangs of New York had a VERY bad script. It had no plot twits at all. Nothing to keep a viewer hooked. Nothing. The diolouge was flat. It just seemed to run on for the length of the movie. And the so called 'love' in the movie. What love? It was two confused people who wanted to take out all of their sexual frustrations out on eachother.But the worst thing of all is the editing. Nothing seems to flow together at all. It is just one jumbled mess, that shows nothing. Really! One minute two people are talking and the next two woman are haveing graphic sex with eachother. THE MOVIE MAKE NO SENSE!I don't think people really watch this movie. I think that they just see the name Martin Scorsese and just say is was great. Well, I really think that Scorsese did a bad job, as did the writers. This movie will not live on as Taxi Driver or Mean Streets did. It is really not worth your time of seeing this movie. Really, it isn't. If you rent it you will just be wasting five bucks because you will probably just shut it of anyway.  Because I don't think that anyone can stand watching a worthless movie for two hours and forty-four minutes.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! 2/10  (it got a two just because of the acting...and for pity)",Null,1,2,24 June 2003
