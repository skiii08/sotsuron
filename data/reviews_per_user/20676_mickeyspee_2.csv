Catch Me If You Can," Boring.
","This movie is long and drawn out. I was surprised to be in a movie theater by myself for the first time in my life. About half way through the movie I thought 'okay all the set-up is done, now it will get more interesting.' It didn't. Now I know why there was nobody else in the theater. This movie is just long and drawn out and there is no climax, no build-up... You would think that a movie called 'Catch Me If You Can' would be a fast paced movie... but this one only made time strech out and slow down.",1,5,22,26 February 2003
The Butterfly Effect," I Agree, Good Movie
","I watched this movie the other night and I thought it was very good, but not perfect as one reviewer said... Some explanation first...What I noticed is that this movie is set about 6 years in the future, probably from about 2002 or 2003, so that makes it about 2010 when you round up in the scenes where Evan is in college. What I am using for a reference is when Evan and his friends are about 13 years old there are several clues that this is set in the present... Evan wearing a Chopper's shirt... Music clues... When I first saw that Evan was wearing a Chopper's shirt I thought that it was a mistake, until I realized that it was the present and not sometime in the 80's.Okay, now jump to 'the college years.' At some point Evan calls someone and they have to ask 'who is it?' Well, since this is set several years in the future, don't you think that just about everyone would have some sort of caller-id? It is hard now to buy a new phone that doesn't have the caller-id feature, and while some homes will continue to use old phones (my grandmother still uses a rotary phone that she has had since the 1970's), most phones should have some kind of caller id functionality.",Null,0,2,17 September 2004
