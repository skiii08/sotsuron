The Blair Witch Project," Dumb City Kids Get Lost In The Woods
","This movie stinks. A trio of three dumb city kids go off into the woods with little food, but apparently a truckload of film and try to film a documentary about the 'Blair Witch'. We are treated to about 20 minutes of a black screen and a good 15 minutes of some pretty trees. Other than that, these guys just go about scaring themselves and boring the viewer. The 'documentary' aspect of the film is overdone, as these guys can't even manage to hold the camera straight most of the time, and the dialogue rarely rises above a fourth-grade level. All in all, about as interesting as watching paint dry.",1,17,33,9 February 2001
Citizen Kane," Important Film, But A Bore
","OK, this was an important film for its time -- no one can dispute that. It revolutionised the use of the camera and the use of space in the mise-en-scene. But the thing is that the story is just unbearably dull! The characters are too hammy and look like they are acting and fail to get the sympathy of the audience at any time. Kane is a jerk who has about as much self-understanding as a two year old kid. How can most people relate to him? If you are really into the history of film or cinematography, this movie is of immeasurable importance and it should be studied. But if you just want to see a good movie with characters that you can relate to and a plot that is interesting, go elsewhere . . . this film is all art and no soul.",4,1,6,7 February 2001
