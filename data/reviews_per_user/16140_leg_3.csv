The Devil's Advocate," Hits too close to home
","I thought this was the most disturbing movie I had ever seen until I saw 'Se7en' a couple of weeks later.I rented this movie because I work in a law firm and thought it would be amusing to see the 'devil as lawyer' premise.  Little did I know that the building they showed as the headquarters for Milton's firm turned out to be the same building where our NY office is housed!  And believe me, I work in a firm where the sexual antics are -- if not as outrageous as those in the film -- at least as prevalent.I was particularly annoyed with the ending, where Al Pacino gets the last laugh.",Null,1,2,6 December 1998
Se7en," DISTURBING
","I guess I'm the only person in the world who hated this movie.  I can't say it didn't grab me, because it did -- I couldn't take my eyes off it until it was over -- but I was left with a horrible, sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach for the better part of the week.  The worst parts were the victims of sloth and lust.  What really bothered me was that there was no resolution in the end.  I don't go to a movie to be taught a lesson or be disgusted -- I go to be entertained.  I can't see that this movie served any purpose other than to shock, which it did.",Null,1,2,6 December 1998
Gone with the Wind," The greatest movie ever made
","I totally love this movie.  I have seen it at least a dozen times and never get tired of it.  (My husband, however, prefers 'Casablanca,' which I think is deadly dull.)  Probably much of my affection for this movie comes from the fact that when I first saw it, around age 17, I identified very closely with Scarlett.  I don't see myself as Scarlett so much any more (I'll be 40 tomorrow), but there's still a good bit of her in me.  I personally think this movie ought to be #1 on the AFI list.And by the way, the person who said that Vivien Leigh was a nobody before she was cast in GWTW and remained a nobody afterward was wrong.  Perhaps that person has never seen 'A Streetcar Named Desire.'  I'm no Tennessee Williams fan, but to call Vivien Leigh a nobody is to show one's ignorance.",Null,0,1,6 December 1998
