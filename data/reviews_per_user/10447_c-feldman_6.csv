Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca is a film made in 1942, the film was directed by Michael Curtiz. The film has many themes and issues that are easy for viewers to relate to. Morality and self-sacrifice are two of the most common themes in Casablanca. The main character Rick Blaine is torn between doing what he knows is right and staying true to his love. Rick Blaine is not the only character willing to give up everything for there love. Victor Laszlo and Ilsa Lund are intertwined with the character Rick. Ilsa is the object of both Victor and Rick's affection. In the beginning of the film Rick is a cynical character who has no interest in helping anyone. In one of the scene Rick says ' he doesn't stick his neck out for anyone.' Speaking about himself in regards to giving Victor the transit letters in order for him to leave Casablanca. As the film progresses Rick has a change in heart, double-crossing people in order to assist Victor and Ilsa in their escape. Rick forgets about his love for Ilsa and resentment for Victor and gives them the transits in order for them to have safe refuge away from Casablanca.There were some scenes in Rick's café that the cinematography was excellent. The light and shadows were especially intricate on the side of Ilsa Lunds' face. Creating a soft tone against the left side of her face. Another scene that I found the lighting absolutely phenomenal was at the end of the film with Captain Louis and Rick. The dark shadows along the left outer edges and the lighter shadow on the right part of the frame creates a light dark frame in which the two men are seen. The light and dark shadows create almost of fog around the scene.",8,0,1,9 December 2010
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","Citizen Kane a 1941 film noted for its cinematography, and music. This film almost seemed as a mystery because throughout the movie there are many unanswered questions and the only way to get the answers is to ask more questions. The cinematography in this film used a lot of deep focus. Deep focus is a shot that the foreground, middle, and background are all in focus so you are able to see the entire shot clearly. The cinematographer Gregg Toland also used many different camera angles such as ones from the floor facing upwards towards the actors. During one of the scenes Toland dug a trench in order to shoot a scene where the ceiling was in the shot. Orson Welles' acting in this film was very powerful. As a viewer I felt as though he had truly embraced his character and took on the role fully. The writing and script of the film was not particularly the best part of the film, it at times was for characterized and a shallow plot line. Throughout this film I saw a common theme of self-regret. I saw man not willing to appreciate what he has and always wanting more. This is a common theme in today's society of many people always wanting more than what they have.",7,0,1,12 December 2010
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","Taxi Driver was a great movie to watch. It was filled with drama and suspense. Robert De Niro did an amazing job in this film he plays a taxi driver who is tired of seeing crime and decides to take matters into his own hands. There were a lot of good actors in this film such as Jodie Foster who plays a 12-year-old prostitute that De Niro attempts to help throughout the movie. There are some controversial scenes in the movie, which make the movie very intense and very real. This is one of my new favorite movies that Robert De Niro is in. He in a way is taking on the role of 'batman' helping protect people in the city because he felt that the crime that was going unnoticed deserved to be noticed.",Null,0,0,13 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Grapes of wrath
",This movie was a movie that was just made when more lighting technology came to the scenes. I think the movie did a great with the lighting. The lighting of the movies had a lot to do with what you can see and bring the movie to life. I thought they did a pretty good job with this because I saw with the lighting it brought out more of the actors. It lighting also made it easy to tell time was passing because they lights would get lighter and darker. I felt that this movies actors also played there roles pretty well because if I had my house being taken from me I believe I would have acted just like sum of the people and fight for my land. While others just would go and move just like I can see people in real life doing. All these things brought the movie to life and did a great job making the movie realistic.,Null,0,1,26 October 2010
The Graduate," The Graduate
","The Graduate was an interesting film to watch it had a certain feel to it that I found appealing. It seemed almost a taboo subject, Ben just gets out of college and is seduced by an older woman. Then more plot twisting occurs turning the end of the film into something I could have never seen coming. The music in this film was very well done Simon and Garfunkel did the song 'Mrs. Robinson' and it was a chart topping hit. The albums soundtrack is amazing ranging from Simon and Garfunkel to Paul Simon and Dave Grusin. The music I feel really helped create the mood for each scene throughout the entire film. The acting done by Dustin Hoffman was good, I definitely would not say it was my favorite of his works but he played the part well. On the other hand I really enjoyed Anne Bancroft's acting in this movie it was very interesting to see her in the light she was portrayed as a house wife looking for fun. This is definitely a movie I would watch again.",Null,1,1,13 December 2010
Psycho," Psycho
","Psycho in my opinion is an American classic. It is a heart-pounding movie with good acting and plots twists. Although I felt that the ending was fairly predictable the beginning of the movie definitely had me thinking. I also think that people watching the film back in the sixties appreciate the plot twist and the simpleness of this film. Watching this movie in 2010 the film seems almost jaded but that is because it was one of the better psychological thriller of its time. So the little cliché moments in the movie were at that time probably very scary. For example the shower scene I felt it to be very fake but once again today we see movies such as Saw it is hard to leave anything to the imagination after that. Psycho was a movie that I enjoyed to watch because it had a certain eerie feel throughout the film, and it is one of the only older horror films that have given me chills.",8,0,0,13 December 2010
