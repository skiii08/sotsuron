Hereditary," The Teletubbies have a more terrifying plot.
","After 40 years of watching movies, I have come to this calculation.In the 80's you got to see a great movie 5 to 6 times a year.In the 90's you got to see a great movie 3 to 4 times a year.In the 00's you got to see a great movie 1 to 2 times a year.in the 10's you were lucky to see a great movie every 2 to 3 years.Now you have to accept, you will probably never see a great movie again.So in conclusion of these findings, it is time to be more productive with these wasted hours. Buy yourself a telescope and have a look at the Universe, and see if you can solve that mystery or count the blades of grass in your garden, whatever floats your boat. Good luck.",1,3,6,24 May 2020
Her," First review in years
","I always see a film through to the end, but no chance with this stinker. Probably the most boring film I have ever watched, I found myself watching my dog sleeping on the rug. The 1 star reviews are spot on.",1,0,1,9 May 2020
