The Avengers," On the nail
","What can I say- I grew up with these guys in the 70's - being an English boy it was not so common to be reading these comics at 10 rather than Whizzer and Chips; et al, but I always loved Marvel for being more 'real' (yeh I Know - these are Superheroes were talking about, I did stop collecting them by the time I was an adult - but yeh - I still got them all!).It was a childhood dream to imagine seeing these characters in a film, but film attempts were always so lame until CGI took hold.The X-Men (1 & 2 & 1st Class,) Spiderman (1,2 and, yes 3) Iron Man & Thor films finally met my childhood expectations. The Avengers has been the icing on the cake. The only disappointment for me is: Where are Janet, Hank, Wanda, Pietro & The Vision..will patience! Comics aside it's a great bundle of cinematic fun!",10,11,22,4 December 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Sadly lacking
","I always hoped they would never try a sequel to Blade Runner. Thirty five years it took to try, yet despite all the technological advancements the result is a weak, typically Hollywood spin-off. This sequel lacks all the suspense of the original (somehow as a film lacks all suspense altogether), the whole film pivots about one question, with over two hours of talk and rather tedious eleven second shots obviously filmed on sets, I longed for the artistry of Scott and the power of his original (plus, I couldn't have that ring tone - was never a fan of Peter and the Wolf anyway).For me it's nothing more than a simple cash-in on a classic.",3,4,8,10 March 2018
Spider-Man 2," Just perfect...
","All were perfectly cast, Alfred Molina makes an excellent Doc Ock adding far more humanity than in the comic and fleshing out the role somewhat.Kirsten Dunst is more then adequate as Mary Jane, though I'd like less screaming and more attitude.Marvel, in my opinion, were always more in touch with their characters than other comic producers, Tobey is just perfect (The ONLY fault is he hasn't got brown eyes..so what...).What's missing now is an ending with Spidey about to be mashed and a bar across the screen that reads : Next: ******* (*title to next film as appropriate). That'll leave us all with our tongues hanging....",9,2,2,30 January 2007
Finding Dory," Dull - contrived - Cringe-worthy
","The animation is fine - as is expected of modern films.As stories go it is the worst cartoon I've seen - only lifted by the great scenes containing Hank the Octopus, but they are not enough to make a movie.Nothing to match it's predecessor: Contrived, dull, cringe-worthy.",1,2,3,5 August 2017
