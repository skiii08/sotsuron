The Blair Witch Project," It's an experiment in HYPE, Too bad it doesn't live up to it.
","I couldn't believe this movie.... the movie makers invent an entire myth behind who and what the blair witch is and they never explain or tell you about it in the film.The characters were realistic, and you eventually really feel something for them but with the weakest plot line I've ever seen in a movie it just doesn't add up to much of a film. They can't even follow a stream out of the woods... with a compass and book on wilderness survival!?!Good editing might be able to save this film, If the characters explained why they were so interested in the blair witch, why they were going into those particular woods and most importantly how the footage was found of them... where was it?I have to say I wish I didn't spend the $5 to see it on discount tuesday",Null,0,1,3 September 1999
