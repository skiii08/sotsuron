Iron Man 3," Iron-Man done right
","First of all, I would like to make clear that I have watched the first two Iron Man movies and the Avengers, so I'm in good stead when seeing this movie. I thought the first Iron-Man was great and the second good, but more of a run-up to the Avengers than Iron-Man. So upon seeing Iron- Man 3, I expected good things, especially after the Avengers which was incredible, and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. We start with Tony Stark giving an opening Monologue as we see his legacy as Iron-Man blown to pieces, from this moment the viewers attention is grabbed. Then we are thrown into a flashback, which details how all of this madness came about. During this flashback, it is made pretty obvious Aldrich Killian is going to be problematic for Iron-Man as Tony Stark stands him up. So we get to present day where we see Tony, and I was very impressed by the characterisation of Tony Stark in this movie particularly. His anxiety attacks as a result of the Avengers can be related to by the viewers- I'm sure none of us could fight off alien hordes, fly a nuke into space then survive the whole ordeal and just walk it off. It reminds us that behind the suit is a man, who still feels and is maybe beginning to realise that he's plunged right into the deep end. Another interesting idea, is his obsession with his suits, of which he has many. This obsession endangers his relationship with Pepper and it really shows the audience that Tony Stark has lost sight of the things most important in his life, in some ways.After dealing with our protagonist, I feel it's only right now to deal with the films antagonist, the Mandarin. The movie took an interesting slant on the mandarin which personally, I loved. The important thing to remember however is the The Mandarin is a comic book character, so while those of us who just watch the films may enjoy the twist, some comic book readers may be left slightly annoyed at the wasted opportunity to use such a great villain. Looking at what he stands for is certainly interesting though, the point it gets across by the Mandarin just as a name, an image for which the real villains can shield themselves with shows that all is not as we see in today's world, some things are not quite as they seem. So now, with the Mandarin out of the way, it's just Aldrich Killian who is played exceptionally well by Guy Pearce. Killian comes across as a sly and devious man who can so easily sneak around doing what he pleases as he is hidden by the Mandarin, which makes the audience feel a stronger dislike towards him as he is never pulled up for causing carnage and lets the Mandarin take all the blame.I loved this movie, but if there is one reason it's marked down it's because of the premise of the plot, Xtremis. Even for a movie series which included alien invaders it seems far fetched and silly to me. By this I mean, not the idea of it, but how inconsistent and 'unbeatable' it is. One minute it only takes a little explosion to kill those corrupt by it, the next Iron-Man has to blow about nine holes into Killian to eventually kill him (an overstatement, but my point is clear). This little thing is why it has been marked down because lets be fair, it is a major plot point, however should I hear a reasonable explanation for it's inconsistency I would re-consider my rating.To sum up, the film exceeded my already high expectations through it's excellent characterisation, brilliant emotional connection and clever quirks. I would have to say this is the defining Iron-Man of the series, which leaves the audience wondering, what part will Tony Stark play in Avengers 2?",8,20,30,26 May 2013
Man of Steel," It means, Hope.
","So with the latest re-boot of Superman, we see a more serious take than perhaps other versions, the emotional connection created between the obvious protagonist, Superman (Clark Kent), is stunning and is so involved that moments invoke tear-jerking. Although, this is an action movie and so for many, a crying fest is not what they have in mind, however Man of Steel delivers from all avenues.Starting with the birth of Kal-El (Superman) then leading onto the racy desolation of Krypton. One thing that is obviously apparent is the stunning look of the film, it is visually tremendous and the action kept the audience on edge. It was however, during this battle sequence that Zack Snyder's love of the zoom effect became apparent, and this did deter from the action a little, not enough to spoil it though. As Kal-El is sent of in hi pod to earth, we see one of the many heart-breaking moments as Kal-El's parents are forced to send off their son so that he can live and preserve the Kryptonian race. We can feel a real connection as we can sympathise for them.As Kal-El takes on his new persona of Clark Kent, we see his struggle to cope with human and earthly life. The most incredible part, perhaps, about the life of Clark Kent is his past, the moment in question, his fathers death. Now this is the moment when you'll find yourself tearing up as Clark is torn between ignoring his fathers ideals to save him, or honor his beliefs and leave him to die, as his dad requests. In the end, we watch as his father is swept away, putting his life on the line. This moment provides the push for Clark to remain silent about his identity until such a time when he will have to put his life on the line to save innocent lives, like his father. From this moment on-wards, there is a lasting emotional connection as we understand him so much better from his past experiences which are shown. Another things that should be noted, is that Henry Cavill lays him wonderfully and also looks perfect to the part. The whole cast in fact played their parts well with Amy Adams doing a great job of Lois Lane, who is more than just a damsel in distress which makes for a nice change, even although she is in many occasions placed in danger needing to be saved.Zod. Zod, was made out to be an iconic villain, almost as incredibly characterised as DC's most famous villain, The Joker, as portrayed by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Well I felt under-whelmed, while there is the obvious hint at his inner mania and the terrorist-like qualities to him, he falls short of the mark. The audience get that he is doing what he sees as right, hinting at a more complex character, but this point seems forced at times, especially as it leads up to his and Superman's final encounter. His stone cold expressions are daunting but he would not be placed in the ranks of complexity as The Joker.Finally, the action. Now, while it was done well, visually and choreographically, at points it dragged on. Mixed with the amazing Hans Zimmer soundtrack, you were on the edge of your seat in awe although after a while you find yourself slumping back wondering how much longer it will last, I am primarily talking about the final fight with Zod, but when it ended, it ended on a high with the audience tensed up as Zod taunts Superman while about to murder a human family, wondering if Superman, will kill Zod or not. Again, during these fight scenes the zoom effect is used but after a while you forget it is even being used. To sum up, the film was a tremendous success which leaves hope for the next installment. Even though at points the film seems to slip, it always bounces back in fabulous fashion making up for any short-comings, of which there were few. The film is the possible start of another great film franchise for DC, leaving hope for the future,",9,0,1,15 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazing?
","'The Amazing Spiderman', the Fox re-boot of the much beloved Spiderman series proves to be an interesting one which leaves the audience wondering about the sequel. I don't mean this in a good way though, when I say 'interesting', I mean it's an interesting and odd slant on the character. When I say it leaves people wondering about a sequel, I mean that while there is substance there, would it not just repeat the original series ideas? More-so than this one.Upon my first watch, I agreed with myself that it was a good film. I thought that I could easily watch it again and it was a good re-boot from the previous series, but upon closer inspection, it was very flawed. Peter Parker is one of my main problems, because he is closer to the comic than the original. While this sounds strange let me explain: in the comics, Peter Parker (Spiderman) is meant to be a bit of a wise- crack when fighting villains and really embraces the costume and powers as a source of freedom. This film shows this side more than the original but yet, I felt myself liking Garfield's Spiderman less. He was too arrogant for my liking, even to the police, just because he is wearing the suit. His tenancy to shout 'Woo!' is also a tad annoying. The fact he doesn't turn up (or does but about 20 meters away from the actual funeral) adds to this dis-liking of the character. Just because he made a promise to Gwen that he won't get her involved in his superhero life doesn't mean he can't show up to respect a man who, although Gwen's father, helped to save Spiderman and the city, sacrificing his life. He's hardly asking Gwen to become his wife by turning up at her father funeral. These points aside, it was still a like-able Spiderman, just less like-able to Tobey Macguire's.The next thing would be it's lack of superhero moments. Half-way through the movie I wouldn't be surprised if many confused it with a Romance film, with a suit wearing acrobat lover. The film does great a great Romantic tension between the characters which we can feel for and enjoy but through this we miss what many paid to see, Spiderman. There are about two fight scenes with the Lizard and Parker can't keep his signature mask on for most of it. The audience feels thinking that was a good Romance, but I would have liked more Spiderman. In other words, they are advertising to the right demographic for Spiderman but the wrong one for the movie they made about him.As for the film in relation to the previous series, it falls short. It starts interestingly enough with Peter Parker's parents scurrying to escape their home, leading the audience to believe that the film will be darker and different from it's predecessor, but it isn't. It's darker but not the story, the design concept. They've made the cities more un-friendly looking and Spiderman a bit more serious looking than Macguire's child-like charm but everything else is just as serious. The story contains little new information too, it uses the Lizard and Gwen Stacey. Neither character was explored in great depth in the original trilogy but adding character alone doesn't make it all too different, it's the same story for the most part. The writers and Director can't be blamed for this though: the story of Spidermans origins have to be the same, otherwise they get an abundance of hate for changing it. Yet they get picked on for it being too similar, it's a lose-lose scenario from this front.As for the run-up to the sequel, what can we expect. Well more of the same as Spiderman 2 I presume. Peter has adapted to his powers but has lost Gwen, or hasn't, the end scene was done so terribly that we are left wondering what to make of it. None-the-less, the film is too similar to the original Trilogy and even as a stand-alone movie, it falls short of what it said it was- an Action movie- and instead re- invents itself as Romance. It doesn't take a darker slant either, it feels childish with the number of 'Woo!''s and arrogant behavior of Peter Parker and while the ideas for a darker movie are there, they are never explored properly. All-in-all, if you want to see a movie that you'll enjoy fist time around without being too fussed about the technicalities of it, this will do. If you on the other hand, want to see a Spiderman movie that will satisfy your thirst for Action/Adventure then opt instead for the original Trilogy.",6,1,3,28 May 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Different
","Having watched the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy and being a massive fan, I expected huge things from The Hobbit and needless to say, it provided. The story was delivered well, with the cut-away stories that won't be found in the book (but are however hinted at) proving exciting and intriguing as it links up the two Trilogies. The overall look of the film is different from The Lord of the Rings, it is a lot more animation heavy and at points light-hearted. Many feel that this is a flaw with the the film and while I can reason with that. I, however, am indifferent. After reading the novel I understood that it was aimed more towards children and was meant to be more 'kid-friendly'. So on that front, the film succeeds, it delivers the film with that warm glow without overdoing it. On the other hand, a large proportion of the audience will be people who are expecting another Lord of the Rings, darker and more 'real'. So in other words, this is The Hobbit, not the Lord of the Rings and while the two are part of the same universe, they are different stories and must be treated so. The film does an excellent job at showcasing it's characters and revealing who they are, with the exception of the dwarfs. With there being such a large number of dwarfs (13) it would be impossible to establish characters for each one, however they do try. They stick to a few important dwarfs which I feel was a smart move by Peter Jackson, the director, allowing the audience not to feel overwhelmed with the amount of information being thrown at them. Then of course, Bilbo Baggins, our main character as played by Martin Freeman who does an excellent job. Through Bilbo we see that stubbornness, and fright at anything that he isn't familiar with, eventually giving in to his curiosity and following the dwarfs on their quest. The main attribute that stands out in Bilbo is his bravery which. At first he is keen to shake the idea that he is of no use to the dwarfs and ultimately makes things worse but as the story reaches it's end we see Bilbo eventually earn the respect of his companions, something the audience feel is deserved by this point. The story is resented well in a fun and exciting manor that, while containing some silly and bizarre elements is strong and holds the attention of it's watchers. From the moment of it's beginning, to it's end, the films tempo changes little. From the refreshing beginning which depicts the events just before the Fellowship of the Ring to the end which makes us determined to explore the next part of the company's journey we rarely lose interest. It keeps very true to the original book which was only what was expected of it in fairness but my main concern is Radagast the Brown. This eccentric wizard is acted well so there is no complaint there but it's more how out of place he seems. It feels as though he was thrown in because he had to be, and then his ridiculous rabbit sledge is pushing the boundaries of silly.In general, this film was a fantastic watch, which falls short only on a few occasions. For a fan of Middle-Earth this won't disappoint, for a fan of the Lord of the Rings it shouldn't disappoint and for a fan of good film this certainly will not disappoint.",8,1,5,1 June 2013
