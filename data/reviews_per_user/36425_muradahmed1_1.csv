Requiem for a Dream," An Intoxicating ride through sex, drugs and addiction
","How great can a film be. Being a cynic I criticise everything, but this film has no flaws, a great story but SO beautifully made and original, it never lets the eye sleep. Acting - Great. Plot - Fab. Cinematography - The best Ive ever seen. Music - Haunting. Its a must see.",10,0,1,18 May 2002
