Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Highly Entertaining - So much for the critics
","I found the film highly entertaining, as I would have expected from a Star Wars movie. However, I can see why the critics hated it. Lots of computer animation, not too much was left that was real.This makes it hard for the actors to interface with them. But, what the heck - critics don't live in the real world. They hate movies that do well and love ones that flop. when will they start rating movies on sheer entertainment value? As far as entertainment goes, I've never seen much that can beat a Star Wars movie and 'Phantom Menace' is certainly very strong in this area. I Loved it.",8,0,0,14 June 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good viewing, but a little too sinister compared to the books.
","Quite compelling viewing, however I was disappointed that the movie had such a dark, evil feel to it. The books were always lighter reading. I have read the books many times and I found characters in the movie acting quite differently to what I expected. I put this down to the director trying to externalize internal struggles that the character was having. This didn't always seem quite successful. Make sure you see the extended version - it makes it much more understandable.",7,0,1,7 December 2003
