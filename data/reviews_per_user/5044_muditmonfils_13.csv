Catch Me If You Can," good one!
","The Steven Spielberg-Tom Hanks pair are known for making one of the most entertaining movies on Earth. Their movies are generally long in duration, very narrative, simple and most importantly very entertaining. Some of the great examples of their movies are: Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal and now Catch Me If You Can. Steven Spielberg's unpredictable story idea together with Tom Hanks raw talent make an Oscar worthy combination.I had always wanted to watch this flick ever since I read about it back in 2002. I never came across any of it's television broadcast. So finally out of frustration I bought the DVD. Catch Me If You Can is about a character called Frank Abagnale Jr played by Leonardo Di Caprio, who starts cheating on people and in the course of time becomes the biggest conman of USA. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an FBI detective who is determined to put an end to Abagnale's activities. After being duped by Abagnale at a hotel, Carl gets an idea about the perfection of Abagnale in duping people.Every actor in this movie is flawless. I was really impressed by Leonardo's performance first as a troubled young student and later as a full blown conman. Tom Hanks together with Christopher Walken adds spice to the movie. Tom's presence in any movie sets the mood of the audience. Martin Sheen is good too but his screen time is very less. Amy Adams was very natural in her acting. Spielberg really picks up the right actor for the right role.Catch Me If You Can is a great light popcorn flick with heavy emotions. It sets the tempo right from the beginning.",8,2,3,30 August 2009
Knocked Up," Hilarious Movie!
","Knocked Up is a story of a lazy and an unemployed man Ben Stone (Rogen) and a career minded TV presenter Alison Scott (Heigl). Ben is a kind of guy who lives with his folks (played by Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel & Martin Starr). All the friends have something in common - they're all unemployed & lazy and spend most of their time fooling around, partying or watching movies or working on a website project which doesn't show much promise. Alison Scott works with E! Entertainment Television. She gets promoted to work as an on the camera presenter. To celebrate her promotion, she goes partying in a club with her elder sister (Leslie Mann) and there she meets Ben who is partying out with his friends. Ben & Alison gel together in the party and under the influence of alcohol end up sleeping together. Next morning at the breakfast table, Alison finds out that she doesn't have anything in common with Ben. The two go their respective ways only to come together again after 8 weeks when Alison finds out that she is pregnant with Ben's child. What happens next? Do the two get together or end it all with a break up? Watch it to find out!The story is quite a simple one. However, what happens around the story is what makes this film a great watch. The film is laced with crude sex related humor throughout. This is what is expected when you have Seth Rogen in the movie. It also features the likes of Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel & Jonah Hill all of whom are known for crude comedy films and present their side roles in the movie as the buddies of Rogen. These characters party their heart out, tease each other, work on a p*rn website, and are lazy as shoot. All the roles have been out played flawlessly. These guys are natural at the buddy stuff and their chemistry with each other is flawless. Katherine Heigl does a fantastic job in the film. She portrays the character with finesse.The film portrays the nuisances of one night stands and the resultant issues that crop up. If you go by the story itself, it feels a little stretched. However, the fantastic performances delivered by the characters and the comic events that surround the central idea of the film makes it a hilarious watch. The plot focuses on responsibility and commitment and also the way the lives of people change by the events that take place after an unwed couple gets pregnant which they hadn't planned.Watch it for the excellent performances especially by Heigl & Rogen in the lead roles and also by the supporting characters who does a great job together to pull off a laugh riot film.Review Link: http://confusonomics.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/movie-review- knocked-up/",7,0,0,31 May 2012
LÃ©on: The Professional," Haunting & Chilling in equal measures!
","Leon is a 1994 thriller directed by French director Luc Besson. Also known as 'The Professional', the film narrates a story about how a hit-man Leon (Reno) gives shelter to a girl Mathilda (Portman) who lives in his neighbourhood after her family is killed by a corrupt DEA officer (Oldman) and his men on the suspicion of stealing his drugs.Mathilda discovers that Leon is a hit-man and works for an Italian mafioso Tony (Aiello). Mathilda begs Leon to teach her his art so that she can take a revenge on the officer who killed her younger brother. In return, she offers to do the household chores apart from teaching him how to read and write. He starts taking her on his assignments where she works as his cleaner and teachers her how to handle guns. One day, when Leon is out on an assignment on his own, Mathilda loads her bag with Leon's guns and bluffs her way into the DEA office after locating it earlier. There she encounters Stansfield who finds about her plans. What happens next?Leon packs some of the most powerful performances in recent times. The role of Mathilda played by a 13 year old Natalie Portman, though much more bolder than to my liking, was superbly portrayed. You'll literally forget that the character is being performed by a 13 year old girl in the movie. It is a very mature character. The character not only loses her family & sees the dead body of her beloved brother, but also carries revenge at such a young age. Mathilda also smokes and is very daring as is shown in the scene where she plans to take on a psychopath drug addict murderer who also happens to be a DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) officer. The role of Stansfield is the best part of the movie for me. A lot has been written about the character on the internet. People have loved it but also have commented on how the character has been 'overly' stated. I really enjoyed the performance of Gary Oldman. The on-screen presence of the character always gave a very sinister feeling. The way he took his drug, his dialogues ('Death is whimsical today', 'I like these calm little moments before a storm. It reminds me of Beethoven!'), his unusual calmness and then a sudden burst of rage made his character look very creepy & unpredictable. Stansfield goes down in my book of the best villains of all time! Reno as a hit-man was good. His fight scenes were probably one of the best of his times especially at the end. His character was strong & professional yet emotionally vulnerable. The background score composed by Eric Serra was both haunting and thrilling in equal measures. It brought in a chilly atmosphere in the movie and kept your heart pumping in the close quarter scenes.I happened to watch a Hindi movie called 'Bichchoo' in 2000 starring Bobby Deol and Rani Mukherjee. After watching Leon I found that Bichchoo was a Hindi remake of the movie. Many scenes especially the ending were almost the same.Overall, Leon is one of the best thriller movies of all time. Although I watched it in 2012, it was released 18 years back in 1994. Many of the scenes especially the ending must have been really thrilling for the audience back then. Elements of the movie have been used by many action movies in the late 90s as well as in the 21st century. A must watch for any cinema enthusiast who haven't checked it out yet!",8,0,1,3 June 2012
28 Weeks Later," Good horror flick, could've been a lot better !
","When I saw the first part of this movie, 28 Days Later, I never thought that the director would win an Oscar for a non-horror movie. For me he was a revolutionary horror movie director. But lo! He did won an Oscar and that too this year itself! And who would that guy be? Danny Boyle. Yes I am right. I had never thought Danny Boyle director of 28 Days Later could ever make a film like Slumdog Millionaire ever in the future. With 28 Days Later he had reinvented the art of scaring the audience. This whole series contains blood thirsty and surreal zombies spreading unrealistic terror and blood throughout Britain. This is not like any other run of the mill horror movie. It has a really interesting story line and a not-so-crazy screenplay unlike every other horror movie which are just made to scare your ass off without any story line, acting etc! 28 Weeks Later continues from where 28 Days Later had left, except for the fact that it has some more gore and intensity.After the rage virus destroys the whole of mainland Britain, a US led troops take control of Britain. It begins reconstructing everything and try to make the things normal again. All the things are going as planned. The infected people have died of starvation. But still something goes wrong and the whole situation blows out of control. Left with no other ideas, the commander orders the execution of 'code-red' which literary means killing every civilian in order to prevent the spreading of the virus at a larger scale. But how did the chaos begin? What happens next? Go, find out yourself!If after watching the movie you were thinking why the hell didn't the virus wreak havoc in other parts of the world here's my take: Britain is surrounded by water on all 4 sides, infected human beings and animals can't reach mainland Europe from that way. Though I suspect whether migratory birds can carry the virus?28 Weeks Later creates a whole new dimension, when the zombies travels across the English channel in the Channel Tunnel (Wow what brains!!) and reach France (Eiffel Tower can be seen clearly). With this we might be able to see the consequences of virus infecting people across the globe in the next installment 28 Months Later rumored to be directed by Danny Boyle.What differentiates this flick with it's predecessor is that it is more violent and disturbing. The scenes of killing are painful to watch especially the massacre scene. The gore content in this movie surpasses that of Saving Private Ryan on my list. This movie is definitely not for people below the ages of 18 years (though they would be itching to watch!) and weak hearted adults.Rose Byrne & Jeremy Renner were awesome. Robert Carlyle was quite good. But the child artiste's Mackintosh Muggleton & Imogen Poots as siblings were simply flawless and natural. The background score by John Murphy was as frightening & thrilling as the movie itself. I would give 5/5 to the sound department. A special mention must be given to the cinematography and the way the camera work was edited using the latest technology. The movie makes use of computer generated darkness at many scenes which were pretty cool. Another factor which makes this movie very realistic!Watch this movie only if you are into horror stuff. This movie might ruin the day for serious movie watchers because of it's content. I would have given it a 4/5. But I was kinda frustrated by the over the top violent scenes.",6,1,1,30 August 2009
Wanted," I got what I wanted !
","Right from the onset I was enthralled by Wanted. It is one of the most explosive action movie I have ever seen.Wanted is a story about a loser Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) who works with a firm as an accountant. His life is hell and nothing seems to be going right with him. He is on anti-anxiety pills and is also harassed by his grumpy boss who keeps irritating him with a stapler and loads of work. He is such a miserly person that together with his best friend his girl friend is cheating on him. But one day his life takes a new leaf when he is rescued by Fox (Angelina Jolie) who happens to be a member of 'The Fraternity' a secret society of trained assassins. She rescues him from a rogue assassin Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) who wants to kill him. Cross has also 'allegedly' killed Wesley's father who was one of the assassins at 'The Fraternity'.Wanted is a film with a lot of twists & turns. It's thrilling narration will keep you absorbed in the movie.It is a suspense thriller with bloody action sequences.. The cinematographer of the movie uses a lot of computer generated effects to give the thrills to the movie.The movie was also nominated for 2 Oscars for 'Best Sound Editing' & 'Best Sound Mixing'. It's a cruel irony that it lost out the awards to Slumdog Millionaire. In my view the guys at the sound department did a flawless job in delivering some of the best sounds ever made for a movie. The sound mixing was awesome & added the necessary juice required for an action movie. The heart pumping background score really sent shivers down my heart!Performance wise going, James McAvoy was surely the show stealer of the movie. I have always been amazed by his expressions. Morgan Freeman's role was small but important. I hope he gets some longer roles in future. His talent needs to be given more on-screen time in order to really get a feel of what he has in store with him. Angelina Jolie was awesome in her role. The rest of the cast did a fair job too.Overall Wanted is a nice & sleek action movie. It will surely remind you of the Matrix series, although it's much more violent. Go enjoy yourself out !http://muditsood.info/articles/",8,3,6,1 April 2009
No Country for Old Men," Fineprint!
","Overview:No Country for Old Men is a movie based on a novel written by Cormac McCarthy with the same name. The story describes how a cop discovers a bag full of million dollars at a site where a drug deal went awry. The cop takes all the money and runs away with it. Chigurh, a professional hit-man, wants to retrieve the satchel of money (which contains a hidden radio transponder to which Chigurh has the corresponding receiver). With the help of the transponder Chigurh tracks the cop. What happens next is ought to be seen in the movie !Was it any good?No Country for Old Men will blow your mind off with the sizzling performances from all of its actors. Javier Barden is the show stealer in the movie. His portrayal of the character Anton Chigurh is very realistic and is worth every penny of your movie ticket! He won an Oscar for his work in this movie. Josh Brolin as the cop comes second in the department. I don't think any other actor has the guts to portray the character played by him. The role of a tough cop always suits him (see American Gangster). The movie has a 1980's touch to it. The barren lands of Texas sharing borders with Mexico adds a cow-boy-movies like backdrop to the film. I give it a 5/5 for the beautiful cinematography. One of the distinctive features of move is that there's hardly any background music in it. You just get to listen to a bit at the starting and a full length(er) at the end. This makes the viewing experience very different compared to other movies.Verdict:No Country for Old Men is a solid movie. Very realistic movie with some of the finest performances of the decade. It won 4 awards at the Oscars. If you have missed this film at the theaters, go grab a DVD.",10,4,6,30 August 2009
Blood Diamond," Superb movie !!
","Warning! May contain spoilers!Overview:Blood Diamond is an over the top violent action-thriller film. It is set against the civil war in Sierra Leone. It describes how the diamond smugglers based in countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe etc to name a few take advantage of the situation in Sierra Leone and sell the diamonds off to European countries at a huge margin. A part of the money they earn is used to fuel more tensions between the rival ethnic groups in the country. One American journalist (Jennifer Connelly) together with a young diamond smuggler (Leonardo Di Caprio) and a local Mende tribesman (Djimon Hounsou) set out together with different objectives. They end up helping each other in their needs and ultimately cracking down on the illegal diamond business.Was it any good?:Blood Diamond is an awesome movie! Flawless direction backed by an outstanding screenplay and acting and an excellent background score, Blood Diamond won't let you settle down for a minute. I liked the way how every part of the smuggling racket was documented in the movie. Leonardo Di Caprio delivered an Oscar worthy performance. It's about time he grab an award at the Oscars. Jennifer Connelly did a fine job as a journalist too. Film's music is really worth checking out. It added the necessary emotions to this bloody thriller.Verdict:Set aside 2 Â½ hours of your life, free your mind and enjoy this vintage thriller.",10,0,0,30 August 2009
Taken," Yes I have 'Taken' something outta this !!
","When I started watching this flick, I didn't knew what was in store for me. The initial 15 minutes of this movie deceived me into a family drama with the kid mad about going on a trip to France and her dad as usual reluctant about her lone travel with her friend. But this dad ain't a commoner nor is the dark secrets of the dangers lurking out there for the young women being alone.Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) is a former spy and knows the risk of sending her daughter to France. He do let her go after giving her a detailed advice i.e what to do and what not to do. But as expected her daughter runs into trouble and is kidnapped by Eastern European traffickers. But these goons aren't a part of a small module. Their circle is much bigger and much stronger and yes their activities are under guard of an secret services agent who happens to be Brian's former colleague. Brian Mills just have 96 hours to protect her beloved before she is lost forever as a sex slave. Will he be able to find her? What are the clues he have in store with him?Taken is packed to the core with mind blowing action sequences thoroughly mixed together with an equally gripping screenplay and storyline. It has everything that a thriller movie requires: car chases, fist-fights, shootouts, stabbing etc. And these elements often reminded me of the Bourne Series while on play. Perhaps Taken was the only movie that I have ever seen, being the closest to the Jason Bourne series on it's thrill meter.The 93 minutes of this movie were very absorbing! Perhaps they were the fastest of my life :-) ! Taken is a total entertainer. It's very thrilling to watch. But there was one niggling element in the movie. That was the background score. It was pretty bland and unimpressive. Perhaps it was the only flaw of the movie.Liam Neeson is damn cool in his acting and dialogue delivery. It was his first movie for me and I was totally surprised by his incredible performance. Hats off to Liam !!Overall, it was a kick-ass stuff. It's a much watch for everybody. I am awaiting it's theater release in India. And mind you, I would be the first person to book my tickets at the movie hall!@ Mudit Soodhttp://muditsood.info/articles/",9,0,0,25 March 2009
Sicario," Felt Over-hyped
","As I walked out of the movie theater I felt a little disappointed. What I had just watched felt incomplete. It finally dawned on me that I was overwhelmed by the massive hype created around the movie. It may be because I was carrying a lot of expectation from it built on days of watching the trailers/videos and reading reviews on the internet. It's a typical hit-man film with a dated story line. Save for the excellent acting by Benecio Del Toro and the fantastic cinematography by Roger Deakins, this film failed to deliver on three basic fronts - the story line, character development and its supposedly 'lead' actor acted out by Emily Bunt. The film failed to impress by giving Emily Bunt's point of view of the story while the real hero of the movie actually was Benicio Del Toro. Emily Bunt's character in the literal sense was a highly irritating one throughout the length of the movie. She was highly vulnerable at the start of the movie and ended quite meekly as well giving up her so called 'ideology' to the threat of bullet. What happened to her partner (Daniel Kaluuya) and Josh Brolin's character at the end is left to a guess. The pace of the movie was surprisingly slow. I was expecting a fast paced thriller (which is actually what the trailers portrayed). The moment you felt the tension building up would explode into something the scene would actually roll into another one. 6/10",6,7,14,11 October 2015
The Happening," Shyamalan's Disaster !
","M Night Shyamalan is known for making slow moving dark masterpieces like The Sixth Sense, Signs & Unbreakable. His movies 'The Village' & 'Lady in the Water' were pretty average ones. But with 'The Happening' we are watching Shyamalan's worst movie till date. I dunno whether he was on a tight budget or what, but he has completely messed up this time.The first 30 minutes of this flick were pretty descent if not good. Things were moving in an orderly fashion. We could sense that the virus is spreading and is slowly and slowly becoming airborne. We could see the remaining residents running away from the infected zones. But what follows in the next 60 minutes is something very disappointing, something for which you won't have thought while paying for your tickets. The director completely loses his grip on the narration and starts to deviate towards various alternatives instead of concentrating on the way the things were being described before. The part in which the couple and the child reach the house of an old woman was completely out of senses. It was put in an abrupt manner in the best part of the climax. The ending of the movie makes no sense at all for at the least Shyamalan fans.If you are a hardcore Shyamalan fan don't watch The Happening (even if you come across any positive review). You will go insane and scratch your head at the credits 'What the hell was that?' Let this film die in peace.",3,1,3,30 August 2009
Munich," Mindblowing!
","Viewer's are advised to watch this movie carefully right from the starting. This flick is one of the most intense and realistic one I have ever seen. The quality of this production is pure Spielberg! It does not contain any unnecessary background music to thrill the audience. The way the picturisation is done it seems the viewers are themselves the characters. The actors played their roles perfectly to give it a fresher feeling. Their Israeli-accent English is impressive! Screenplay and direction is flawless. The violence, gore and blood made the viewing breathtaking. The ending may seem to be incomplete, but in every way it was acceptable.",10,1,3,1 April 2008
50_50," Perfect blend of serious drama & humor!
","50/50 is a film about a man's battle with cancer and the way his relationships unfold during the battle. It is loosely based on the experiences of Will Reiser who is the writer of the film.The film is about a radio journalist Adam Lerner (Gordon-Levitt) who is having problems with his back for a while. Later, when he goes to the hospital for a check up, he finds that he is suffering from a rare form of cancer which is eating away his bones & tissues. He checks on the internet and finds that his odds of surviving stands at 50/50. On hearing about his cancer, his best friend & co-worker Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to make him as normal as possible. He is relieved by the fact that he still has 50% chance of survival. Adam's girl friend cheats on him and he breaks up with her. He starts getting close with his therapist McKay (Kendrick) and fellow cancer patients while he is undergoing Chemotherapy. After sometime it is discovered that his cancer is not responding to the chemotherapy and he'll have to undergo a surgery in order to remove the tumour. However, the success of the surgery is slim. Also, one of the cancer patients with whom he was close dies and the thought finally dawns on him as to how close he was to death. Will he be able to defeat the cancer?The small highlight of the movie above would make you think that this movie is some serious stuff which is not entirely true. Though the movie deals with an issue as serious as cancer, it does so with a human face. It is laced with traces of comedy. When you have a guy like Seth Rogen in a movie the least you can expect is some humour and he delivers it with finesse. 50/50's perfect blend of comedy & drama is what it is worth watching for together with the excellent performances by the characters. Joseph Gordon-Levitt pulls off an excellent performance as a cancer patient. It is the only movie I've seen of him apart from his role in Inception. I liked the way the background music blended with the emotions of the film. It made sure the main theme of the movie remained intact.50/50 is a perfect blend of serious drama and crude humour surrounding a man's battle with cancer. One of its kind movie. Go for it!",8,0,0,31 May 2012
Slumdog Millionaire," Awesome!
","Slumdog Millionaire opens the rotten face of India, does it? Does it show the so called 'dirty underbelly' of India? Slumdog word is racist as alleged by a chap from Bihar. But really?? If I had one word to describe these comments it would have been a *beep*!!By no means this movie is aimed at showing the chronic poverty of our nation. Many reviewers have criticized this movie for showing only the dirty reality of the country instead of displaying all those swanky buildings, glittering malls etc.Slumdog Millionaire narrates a story of 2 siblings & a girl, who rise from the dirty slum life and move into different directions of life. The older brother ('Salim'-played by Madhur Mittal) ends up working for a gangster, the girl ('Latika'-played by Frieda Pinto) ends up as a show girl with the same gangsters and the hero of the movie the younger brother ('Jamal'-played by Dev Patel) ends up living a rather straight life as a tea server in a call center. Jamal reaches the 'hot seat' of Kaun Banega Crorepati hosted by an arrogant quiz master Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) who don't want him to win the game. He calls the police to get Jamal Malik arrested on the charges of fraud at the end of day 1 of the show. At the police station Jamal is tortured first by the sound thrashing from Constable Srinivas (Saurabh Shukla) and then he is subjected to electric shock, all to make him speak about how a tea serving slum dweller can give the correct answers.The movie revolves around the dingy slums of Dharavi. The heaps and heaps of garbage, dogs with flees, young Jamal jumping in a pit full of *beep* (*sic*), Hindu-Muslim riots, pimps, gangsters, rough language is some of the few characteristics of the film which together with the superb cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle makes it an ultra realistic movie. Kudos to the director Danny Boyle and co-director Loveleen Tandon for the impressive direction and superb camera takes which shows the minutest of the details of the dirty slum life. The screenplay was outstanding.Acting:If I had to rate the performance of the characters I would surely give a high five to the children artists of the movie. Almost half of the movie shows them and their acting was very natural and realistic. Dev Patel was fine too. Frieda Pinto didn't had too much of the screen time but delivered good performance. Anil Kapoor was cool. Irrfan Khan as the deadly cop together with Saurabh Shukla gave the top performances together with the child artists. Mahesh Manjrekar was looking a real gangster. He was rough, bad and whatever you may call a gangster. Madhur Mittal as the older brother Salim was quite good.Sound/Music: Well the music has so many nominations for the Oscars what more can I write!!??!! The sound effects were superb. The background score was creepy good. 'Jai Ho' track comes at the end of the movie. The song is classic but I doubt whether it would take away the Oscar. Let's hope for the best. A.R Rahman proves that he is the best in this field!The movie has been given an 'A' certificate and rightly so. It has some good amount of strong language, violence in the form of riots, torture, a child being blinded with hot syrup (something), murder and other such things happening in the slums. These violent scenes are quite chilling and tense.Overall I would recommend this movie to every person who has a tag 'Indian' attached to him/her. A detailed insight into the murky life of slum dwellers. Slumdog Millionaire is one of those movies which has a happy ending. And out of the 10 Oscar nominations it would bag at least three i.e in 'cinematography', 'editing' & for the song 'Jai Ho'. It is a perfect edge of the seat thriller wrapped in the ghostly realities of slums. Hightly recommended.",10,0,3,23 January 2009
