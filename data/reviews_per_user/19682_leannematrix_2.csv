The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," On first watch slow, but repeated viewing is highly rewarding
","** Contains spoilers **First of all, I have to say I am a fan of the first 'Hunger Games' movie and felt it was well done if not a little wrong in places (e.g. the mutts at the end of the movie were not as horrific as I think they should have been). And I absolutely loved 'Catching Fire'. For me, this was the best movie of 2013 and was the finest adaptation of a book (YA or otherwise) that I've ever seen.However, when it comes to 'Mockingjay: Part 1' things go a little awry. I'm not a fan of splitting a final book into two parts to begin with, and because of 'Mockingjay''s sometimes meandering plot in the book, I was always sceptical about this third movie.When I first watched this in the cinema in 2014, I felt like mostly everyone else - it was boring, dull, nothing happened etc. However, I recently bought the blu-ray, and after almost a year between viewings, I felt like I was watching 'Mockingjay: Part 1' with new eyes.This time I saw the fine attention to detail by the writers and director. Unlike other recent YA adaptions (i.e. 'The Scorch Trials' and 'Insurgent') the screenwriters on 'Mockingjay: Part 1' seemed to truly know their source material inside and out.There are also certain scenes in the movie which are exceptional. Such as Katniss discovering the mass of skeletons in District 12, Katniss filming the propo with Plutarch (the comic timing of Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly judged here) and most famously, the 'Hanging Tree' scene.The acting is fantastic throughout (as it should be with all those Academy Award nominees and winners) and is all underpinned by James Newton Howard's finest Hunger Games score to date. Elegant and haunting, the music is truly magnificent.Not as good as 'Catching Fire' yet better judged than 'The Hunger Games', 'Mockingjay: Part 1' deserves a better reputation than it has. It may not be as action packed as the first two movies - and inevitably the final instalment - yet it is filled with subtleties and horrifically, beautiful shots. The movie is quiet and slow, yet its core message (our obsession with reality TV, growing desensitisation and the futility of war) has never been shouted louder. And for that alone, 'Mockingjay: Part 1' should be applauded and given a second chance.",8,3,6,8 October 2015
The Maze Runner," Huge potential on display in this exciting YA adaptation
","** Contains spoilers **'The Maze Runner' is an incredibly enjoyable movie which shows some excellent potential for its sequels - 'The Scorch Trials' and 'The Death Cure'.Well adapted from the original YA novel by James Dashner, 'The Maze Runner' is an exciting 2 hour movie that is ahead of most of its counterparts (think 'Divergent', 'I Am Number Four' etc.) and only really lags behind the superior 'The Hunger Games' franchise.First time feature-film director, Wes Ball, shows his mettle as a director set for a fine future, as well as Dylan O'Brien who is on top form as our hero Thomas. Anyone familiar with O'Brien's work as Stiles on MTV's 'Teen Wolf' will be well aware of his acting chops, but here he gets the opportunity to really show that he is potentially a huge, future A-list actor.As well as this, 'The Maze Runner' is neatly paced sticking to the three act structure and Hero's Journey to the letter. And there is an air of mystery to the reason for the boys (and later Teresa) being trapped in the Glade which only adds to the movie's appeal.The action scenes are expertly shot and the maze itself is beautifully realised by a combination of physical sets and CGI. The Grievers (whilst physically differing to their book counterparts) are terrifying and well designed.As good as the action scenes were, however, I found it was the quieter scenes which really stood out for me. For instance, Thomas' scene with Gally in the Pit was perfectly acted by both and gave us a nice look into Gally's mind and motivations. I also particularly liked Thomas' chat with Chuck - their brotherly bond that is so present in the book was beautifully illustrated. And all of the flashbacks Thomas' sees of his past at WCKD.However, the best scene of the movie was the 'false end'. Similar to the book, yet heightened by the choice of camera shots - and particularly John Paesano's score - the scene in the lab before Gally's miraculous reappearance was perfection personified. If I hadn't have read the book beforehand, and knew a certain character's death was coming, I would have been astounded by the final sting in 'The Maze Runner''s tail, as I think it's completely unexpected.After this, the Gladers 'rescue' proves to be a neat and tidy ending, whilst simultaneously whetting the audiences' appetite for the sequel. The aerial shot of the maze in its entirety was beautiful, and our first look at 'The Scorch' was exciting.There is so much potential on offer with this first instalment of 'The Maze Runner' trilogy, and more often than not, this adaptation hits rather than misses. Well acted, well directed, and well written, 'The Maze Runner' is a 2 hour thrill-ride that races through its run time and leaves you eagerly awaiting films two and three. 8/10",8,1,2,8 October 2015
