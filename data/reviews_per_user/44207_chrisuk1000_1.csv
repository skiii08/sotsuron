Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," An action packed feast for the eyes and thoroughly enjoyable entertainment.
","Reading some reviews I can't understand why some people get so serious about something that is clearly about entertainment and entertaining it certainly is. I enjoyed the whole movie thoroughly and will definitely watch it again. Furthermore I particularly liked some of the filming, some great camera work going on. For me this is an excellent and highly enjoyable movie. I laughed all the way through and so did the rest of the audience, a good sign I suspect Dr Watson. Additionally I really have to say Robert Downey Jr is superb in the role and overall I think it is a must see flick. I hope it leaves you as entertained as I was. Enjoy C",10,0,0,6 January 2012
