Skyfall," My favorite Bond movie from Craig.
","This has to be my favorite Bond movie with Craig and maybe the best Bond film ever. The end was so sad that I cry on cinema and I cry when I watch this on Blu-ray. Javi plays Silva, damn what a Spanish actor. Best Bond movie on a long time!",9,0,3,6 December 2018
Finding Nemo," One of the best movie ever.
","Best Animated Movie Ever. Best Disney Pixar Movie. This movie was just spectacular. Wonderful storytelling, amazing graphic, and a lot of fun scenes. I have no words! 10/10.",10,0,0,4 December 2018
Rio," Verry good anime
","I can't belive the rating is so low. This was a fun family movie, and this is also one of my current favorite anime movie. Can't wait too see Rio 2 soon.",8,0,0,6 December 2018
