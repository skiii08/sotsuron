Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What I should have expected, not what I hoped for
","This movie got a lot of bad comments mostly because it wasn't what people thought it would be.  I think everyone expected all three previous Star Wars movies all rolled into one.  I was a bit disappointed when I left the theater the first time, although I thought the movie was a lot of fun. I'm not a kid anymore so I have much higher expectations, and am not as easily overwhelmed with the warriors religion of the force.  That's my problem, and I shouldn't have expected to get the same rush I did when I watched the old Star Wars films.Overall, it was still an excellent movie that I've seen three times now. I think it stayed with the tradition of the first three movies of keeping a simple plot in a complex world.  The Star Wars series does what no other science fiction movie has done in creating an immense and complex system with wars and battle stations that we see through the eyes of an unsuspecting hero.  The Phantom Menace continued with this ability, but went a little too far in the simplicity of the plot, or at least its irrelevance to what eventually happens.I have other criticisms of the film.  I think they made this too much of a kid movie.  Not that I'm against kid movies, but imagine Darth Vader strangling an officer for failing to complete a mission in this film, it doesn't fit in with where the series was originally going.  Kids are a better target for merchandising, and this seemed to really guide the movie making. The first Star Wars was much more serious, and nearly every kid in America was dressing up like Luke Skywalker and making his own light saber. The level of childness in the film was unnecessary.  The kid that played Anikan Skywalker was not very good and was way too young.  I think a twelve or thirteen year old boy would have been much more believable, and they could have found one at that age that had developed acting skills.  The audience knows nothing of the early age required to start training a jedi knight, so why not make a twelve year old too old in the eyes of Yoda. Also, I think it's a lame trick to use an entire movie to get you hooked on the next movie.  At the end of the film, the senator becomes chancellor, but we'll have to wait till the next film before anything real important happens. They should have removed a little bit of the cute stuff (i.e. Anikan and Mom, the Jar-Jar sub movie) and carried the political developments further with this film.  It sort of had the feel of the last TV show of the season.Too bad Liam Neeson's character died in the movie, he was awesome, and I wish I could plan on seeing him again.",Null,0,1,17 August 2000
Fight Club," Almost a great movie
","This was one of the best movies I've seen all year, but it fell short of being as good as it could have been.  I thought the acting by the two important cast members was excellent; I was especially impressed with the development of Ed Norton's character.  The movie didn't try and be too deep and wasn't afraid to use humor to keep the story interesting.  The characters were somewhat comical, but lent to the story well without being one dimensional and silly.There were some flaws with this film though.  The movie tends to drag at times when they just reinforce an aspect of the movie to make sure you get it.  'Tyler's anti-mainstream we get it, move on please'; ' 'okay. they fight move on please'.  There are about three long dead spaces like this in the movie.  Unfortunately, from the big twist in the story to the end is the worst of these dead times. The movie should have ended right after the twist.  The big finale seems irrelevant to the story and forced into the plot.  The end seemed like an add-on that was not well explained or had any importance.  I can imagine the writers sitting around saying we need to end big, but I don't know how.  Just blow something up.The reason I bring out the negative points is because the Hollywood laziness that plagues the film industry reduced this movie from being a classic to being a really good movie.  They had a good story, great acting, and a moment in history for which the message was relevant, but they cut the rope short filled the movie with some dead space and threw together an ending.In summary it was one of the best movies of the year, but fell short of what it could have been.",8,0,1,17 August 2000
Good Will Hunting," Did I miss something?
","I don't get it.  I rented the movie because it was supposed to be great. It was at best mediocre.  Did it just appeal to people because they think they are really smart and have never expressed themselves, so they identify with some character who has an inherent knowledge of differential equations and sociology.  Nothing was believable in this movie: the love, the pain, the character, or the premise.  Ben Affleck's character was the only redeeming quality in the movie.  Robin Williams did his worst acting job since Mork and Mindy.  It was just a movie about a boy who lacked complexity and was 'wicked smart'.",4,4,6,17 August 2000
The Matrix," Entertaining replay of old sci-fi themes
","This movie was entertaining, but I must say I'm baffled by all the hype and enthusiasm.  The movie rolled along with lots of action and violence so you weren't bored.  I've seen comments on this being a thinking man's movie, it's not even a thinking producer's movie.  There are basically two 'ideas' in the movie (I won't spoil, because they are the movie).  Both of these ideas are simply grabbed from other science fiction writing without any sort of original twist, except for combining them.  When you first learn about these two main ideas it's surprising only because they come from nowhere, you're not really expecting them, but you are trying to figure out a few things.  Up to this point in the movie it's pretty neat, but lacks any subtlety, they just throw it at you.  After they introduce the two main themes just sit back and watch the action, nothing else intriguing happens.As I said before, the movie keeps moving so you don't get bored. But after a while the gaps in logic and inconsistencies get a little overwhelming. Part of fantasy stories is the creation of a universe where certain rules apply that may be different than what we are used to, whether it's in space or software.   This movie makes no attempt at explaining anything, and with the stuff they throw at you, they need to explain it (for the thinking man at least).  Science fiction doesn't need to be believable, per se (it is fiction), but it should be believable within the boundaries set for that story.  It's seems like they wrote the plot as a first try and didn't bother with details.  For example, what's up with the phone thing why not just click you're heels together three times.  'The body can't live without the brain' doesn't mean you can just sort of makeup arbitrary rules throughout the story.Another thing I can't figure out is why in this universe they have to walk around with stone faces all the time.  Perhaps that was just too make sure Keanu Reeves didn't stand out as a bad actor.  It worked, this was the least annoying role I've seen him in.  A movie without any dialogue is a perfect fit for Keanu.Despite the shallowness of the movies and the bad acting, I did enjoy watching it, but not as a thinking man.  If you just let the movie unfold in front of you it has enough action and graphics to be entertaining.It does sadden me how such a one dimensional movie can overwhelm the minds of people.  Maybe you all need to read a book once in a while to understand what real complexity is.  Just throwing out someone else's ideas with computer graphics does not make a genius, although it can be entertaining.",6,0,1,17 August 2000
