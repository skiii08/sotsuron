Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Thurman brings new meaning to The Bitch is Back
","Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Gordon Liu, Michael Parks. Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino. And a sneak peek at Samuel L. Jackson's back.Thurman brings new meaning to The Bitch is Back. The sequel to the gore-fest Kill Bill volume 1 returns with revenge and discipline. The Bride (Thurman) seeks again to quench her thirst of the blood from the three remaining assassins that shot her around four years ago. This time she aims to kill Bill's redneck brother Budd (Madsen), Bill's new lady friend Elle Driver (Hannah), and the mastermind of evil Bill himself (Caradine).I myself thought that the second one was not as good or gory as the first one. A surprisingly good sequel, once again the black and white was Tarantino-like. Meaning superb and a classical technique in the hands of Quentin. I'll admit the movie had it's high points but I thought they did to much talking. Unlike the first where she was jumping around with her Hattori Hanzo sword killing people left and right. The fight adviser Yuen Woo-Ping returns to help out in the fight scenes this time winning them the Best Choreographed Fight of 2004. But never the less a disappointing and yet at the same time a surprisingly good movie. My final rating 7/10.",8,0,1,27 April 2005
The New World," Exquisite slice of dramatic geography, Farrell suits himself nicely along side Malick
","*** Colin Farrell, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, O'Orianka Kilcher, Wes Studi, Jamie Harris. Directed by Terrence Malick Normally a redundant story line involving a feud and then settlement between settlers and a Native Tribe. This time focusing on John Smith (Farrell), who upon capture is brought back to the tribes leader. But instead of death, leads him to a chemistry between a young girl Pocahontas (Kilcher). Sound familiar? If it does, it probably reminds you of 2003's 'Last Samuri' where upon capture is taught the ways and language of the local's. Malick does a fine job making an exquisite slice of 17th century dramatic geography. And Bale although not receiving as much screen time as he should, going double for Plummer still do a fine job. Despite some of Farrell's recent projects which left me bored, 'New World' is beautiful in cinematography and acting. Which leads me to be astounded that more Oscar nominations was not received.",8,2,6,8 May 2006
Walk the Line," Heeeere's Johnny! Cash in on one of the year finest, Phoenix and Witherspoon make a dynamic duo
","***1/2 Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Patrick, Dallas Roberts, Dan John Miller, Ginnifer Goodwin. Directed by James Mangold. A brilliantly made biopic of legendary country singer Johnny Cash (Phenomenal Phoenix) written and directed by the talented James Mangold off the books written by Cash himself. As did 'Ray' the film is told through a flash back as Cash plays his finest gig at Folsom State Prison. Phoenix really brings his whole deck of cards to the show this time and Wonderful Witherspoon as June Carter really steals the show. Overall phenomenal acting all around and surely one of the years finest. Phoenix did a great job talking and walking the line as Johnny Cash who through out the movie deals with his career and crumbling marriage. Mangold's film is one of 05's best so far and sure fire steals the spotlight. Bravo Phoenix and Witherspoon. My final rating 9/10.",9,2,5,21 November 2005
Mission: Impossible III," 'Mission' accomplished, Edge of your seat, popcorn extravaganza, espionage in first class form
","*** Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup, Kerri Russel. Directed by J.J Abrams The third and possibly best installment to the espionage thrillers with IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise, in top notch form) up against the odds. While reuniting with his team and going up against arms dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman, a surprisingly evil villain) who both search to recover a valuable 'Rabbit's Foot'. Cruise and Hoffman battle off with brains and edge of your seat combating action (!). 'Mission Impossible 3' packs the fun and never fails to skimp out on it. Possibly the best of the series and Abrams first job in the directing job, and does a hell of one too. Which after the second 'MI' where ironically an action director, John Woo, hardly supplies a decent supplement of action. Instead a boring dose of misguided thrills and spills that fall short of suspense or adventure.",8,2,4,7 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Useless slice of FICTION, we've all seen this # before,
","*1/2 Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Lucy Lui, Ben Kingsley. Okay since the 90's when Tarantino did 'Pulp Fiction' everyone is trying to take on that oh so cool mood in film. But 'Selvin' tries too hard and all the attempts result in an annoying ,confusing piece of utter wanna be noir garbage. A young kid (Hartnett) who gets his identity confused is brought and mixed up with two mob bosses (Freeman and Kingsley). This movie was far too complicated to even enjoy, you have about five things all clustered together. 'Slevin''s whole story line is what you've seen before, perhaps a nice slice of FICTION. By far one of the years most forgettable and worst films",2,6,13,7 September 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Burstyn's performance will haunt you to the last tear jerking scene, possibly the strongest movie ever made
","**** Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connely, Christopher McDonald, Keith David, Louise Lasser. Directed by Darren AronofskyI'll start off by saying that 'Requiem' is possibly the strongest, saddest and most well acted movie I've ever seen. I wish there were more adjectives for the word 'astonishing' just so I could have more words to compliment Ellen Burstyn's captivating performance. Never in all of my life of watching movies have I felt so connected with the character study or let alone believe what is being done to these poor people.The four stories of a few patrons in New York city consisting of an ailing, old mother Sara (Burstyn) and her dead beat, junkie son Harry (Leto), his pal Tyrone (Wayans, a surprisingly great performance) and Harry's lover Marion (Connely). When their drug addiction warps into something unimaginable it renders them helpless and scrounging for a way to live through the day with just one more taste of that sweet sweet drug they begin to crave. Hubert Selby is a great writer, he did a well adapted screenplay of his book (which I am still reading). The lines are beautiful, everything down to that look on their faces when the realization of their dreams being crushed apart is there. And what is so shocking, what is so engaging of 'Requiem' is that it is believable. I even began to care for them, for their lives and the effects on each action. Aronofsky has met his high point, since 'Pi' wasn't that great, but 'Requiem' will be the one he'll be remember for. And Marlon Wayans who never astounded me, does a great job his character as well is played perfect. This is by far one of the best ensemble casts in a movie that all work well and function through out since I can remember. And I have never been so outraged as when Burstyn did not win the Academy Award, those people must be out of their f@#&%ng minds to not see the beauty in her performance. This movie will in fact haunt you to the very last frame with Clint Mansell's 'Summer Overture' playing in the background. Mansell's beautiful sounds add to the effect, making it a perfect tear jerker. And this is part of the very elite list of movies that made me come so close to actually shed tears at the sight and sound of the last scene. So in one word if I had to describe 'Requiem', that would be REAL.",10,3,6,27 May 2006
United 93," UNITED we stand, harsh realism makes for a years must and one of the best films
","****, the first of two major motion pictures depicting 9/11 and the horrific events that would follow. The other being Stone's 'World Trade Center' and the best of the two 'United 93' does a top notch job. You would figure it would take on so many aspects, with characters and more plots, and the President. But it doesn't, it settles on people, it's real. These people are strangers to us but we get emotionally involved, that is what makes Greengrass a great writer/director here. He takes real people and makes it work to a well formulated story of heroism. The story of course about the few passengers about flight 93 who took the courage to defy the terrorist who have hijacked it. Most of the characters played by no name actors, which I love. I am glad I didn't see Tom Cruise in there screaming or over acting on the plane. Another reason why 'United' works, it has every essence of an ordinary film, almost low budget with a big heart.This movie does not make fun of the people who lost their lives that day, it salutes them. This movie is beautiful, inspirational and one of the years must see films. I loved this movie and the last 15 minutes will leave you breathless and amazed. A certain for Best Pic/director and screenplay",9,3,6,2 September 2006
Underworld," Pitiful vampire movie. The reigning champ of the bloodsuckers is non-other than Blade
","Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, Sophia Myles, Robbie(y) Gee, Bill Nighy, Erwin Leder. Directed by Len Wiseman.Underworld overall was a pitiful vampire movie. The raining champ of the bloodsuckers is non-other than Blade. Aside from the sexy Beckinsale this movie did nothing for me. The battle scenes seemed overrated and lame; I didn't want vampires to have guns they should have fell from the sky and ripped out someone's neck.A war is brewing between Vampires and Werewolves. Selene (Beckinsale) is a Werewolf hunter who well shoots them down. Until she meets Michael Corvin (Speeman), who wants to stop the war before it starts.The movie was sold short it had no good dialogue between the characters, and the action scenes were entertaining at most. The best part for me was Beckinsale running around in that tight black leather. Almost like a Catwoman suite. My final rating 4/10.",4,0,2,19 April 2005
Shaun of the Dead," A smart, gruesomely funny zom-com.
","**** Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Nicola Cunningham, Peter Serafinowicz. Directed by Edgar Wright.The movie written by the director Edgar Wright and actor Simon Pegg whom also plays Shaun in the movie make a hilarious observation on what is an apocalyptic nightmare. Shaun (Pegg) is an over worked lackey who's love life with his girlfriend Liz (Ashfield) is dying on it's feet, in his last fleeting attempt to please her, he only makes it worse. Shaun now suffering the heartbreak in the company of his bumbling side-kick Ed (Frost) is soon shocked when the recently deceased come back to life. Wright and Pegg make what seems to be an over indulged film genre back to life and one of the best zombie movies out there. My final rating 10/10.",10,4,10,28 July 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not 'Dead' in the water, the most fun I've had at the movies all year long, savvy?
","***1/2 Johnny Deep, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook. Directed by Gore VerbinskiThe sequel to 2003's summer smash hit 'Pirates: Curse of the Black Pearl' comes the new and near more entertaining summer blockbuster for 2006. I've gotten to see a lot of so-called 'extravaganzas' like 'Poseidon', 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Superman Returns' and I am pleased to say 'Dead Man's Chest' does not disappoint in it's efforts. Instead each scene is well crafted by original director Verbinski (Showcasing some talent this time around in his directing) to make it by far the most entertaining movie I've seen all year.Cunning Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp, savvy?) is being hunted down by the legendary 'locker' owner Davy Jones (Nighy, respectfully) to repay his debt. While a Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Bloom) get prepared for there wedding until forced to find Jack and retrieve a valuable compass. Also joining the crew are the two ex- immortal Pirates from the Black Pearl (Arenberg and Crook). And Crook gets the laughs with his eye popping in and out at times'Pirates' although with a run time of 2 hours and a handful of minutes does not bore with a tiresome story line. Instead 90 percent of the run time is filled with action both on land and water. Kudos to the special effects team who did a great job with Davy's water logged ship and adding those little sea shells you find on the rocks. A dazzling display of directing and an all out beautiful film with great CGI. Certainly on the years MUST LIST, I for one savvy",6,5,9,9 July 2006
Hostel," 'Eurotrip' meets 'Saw', Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino do not mix, another lame horror flick with bad acting (at best)
","*1/2 Jana Kaderabkova, Jennifer Lim, Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Gudjonsson, Barbara Nedeljakova. Directed by Eli RothYet another poorly acted teenage gore/horror picture with a redundant storyline, thought up and written by Eli Roth. Even the gore got old quick, it was sick when showed but doesn't account for the whole 95 minute peep show with nothing but breasts and ass dwelling in for over a half hour. And shockingly make-up effects artist Greg Nicotero proving to be an up and coming Tom Savini when his work is showed every ten minutes. But when you get right down to it a few buckets of scarcely seen fake blood and cliché' lines with a predictable story line (at best) really doesn't make it worth wild.The story where three horny backpackers in search of girls and a good time soon get more than they bargain for. Yet another 'Saw' parody with less blood than anticipated. All and all the movie goes nowhere, drowning in a puddle of its own fake blood with the help of bad acting. And oddly enough let down my Quentin Tarantino and shocked that he would think this was presentable. My final rating 3/10.",5,10,19,9 January 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," 'Ice, Ice' Baby, held together with slap stick humor and annoying dialogue with somewhat of a rural dark atmosphere for a kids movie
","**1/2 Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Seann William Scott, Queen Latifah, Josh Peck, Jay Leno and Chris Wedge. Directed by Carlos Saldanha. A sequel to the 2002 original 'Ice Age' only this time the three so-called friends Manny (Romano), Diego (Leary) and Sid (Leguizamo) are trying to make it out of the valley before the glacier melts. Of course cutting in and out with plot hole filler Scrat (Wedge), who is the star of the show, just looking for an acorn. While the trio are walking they run into a dang of opossums (Scott and Peck, the most annoying characters in the whole movie) and Ellie (Latifah, surprisingly descent) who thinks she too is a possum. 'Ice Age' gets in the chuckles with annoying dialogue and quick one liners, while some of the material seems a little too dark for the audience it is meant for. My final rating 7/10",5,0,2,7 April 2006
Finding Nemo," A funny family film for 2003
","*** 1/2 Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Willem Dafoe, Stephen Root, Geoffrey Rush, Bob Peterson, Barry Humphries and Andrew Stanton. Directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich. Following the trail of the past years were animated movies ruled the box office for weeks at a time is Finding Nemo, Pixar's best movie so far. The movie about a paranoid father figure (Brooks) who finally lets his eager son Nemo (Gould) go to school. Nemo later is taken away by Scubadivers,Marlin now headstrong swims out to sea in search of his son, instead he meets up with an amnesia troubled fish Dory (DeGeneres). Together the two set off to find Marlin's lost son before it's to late. To be honest the story is a reminder of Shrek two odd balls meet up and are forced to be friends and go on an adventure. An over used story idea but none the less a good movie. Pixar studios surpass my expectations in an animated movie. My final rating 8/10.",10,0,1,28 July 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," I think we all now the true stars in this movie......The effects
","Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllehaal, Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Sela Waed, Ian Holm, and Sasha Roiz. Directed by Roland Emmerich.I think after seeing The Day After Tomorrow we could all agree that the true stars in this flick are graphics. Still Quaid gives a Bill Paxton performance, if you don't know that is an insult. It seems they are almost alike as if one was copying the other.Any way the story revolves around Climatologist Jack Hall (Quaid) whom believes that a giant storm will come very soon. When the storm does hit it traps his son whom is visiting in New York (Gyllenhal). Jack decides he must go and save him. Roland Emmerich whom directed Independnce Day, Which I have no idea why it's so popular, I feel it's just good because of all the glamor they try to give it. Yet again they hype you up only for a bigger let down.Day After Tomorrow just proves yet again that the true stars of both Paxton and Quaid's movie are not them but the effects. Overall I did like Day After Tomorrow. My final rating 7/10. Where the actors fail the graphics pick up to keep the movie more then interesting but a cool flick to watch.",7,0,1,5 April 2005
Silent Hill," This HILL stays SILENT despite dark and dazzling effects, yawn inducing overall
","** Radha Mitchell, Laure Holden, Sean Bean, Kim Coates, Tanya Allen, Jodelle Ferland. Directed by Christophe Gans. What starts as a typical video game ala cinema slowly turns from mindless creature action to mindless talking about a deserted town due to a fire in Silent Hill. Currently heading to the town a mother (Mitchell) and her creepy child (Ferland) but when they reach the town, they discover it's dark past and hidden present. 'Silent Hill' attempts to make noise but with it's many lousy failed mishaps it echoes in silence. Despite those effects that dragged me into it, with the creatures and all, the movie still holds many flaws. Gans has no technique other than effects and plenty of them aside the incoherent story line, regrettable overall",4,1,3,19 August 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Inspiring true story, compelling performance by Cheadle, one of the best movies I'v ever seen
","**** Don Cheadle, Nick Nolte, Jophie Okonedo, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Desmond Dube, Joaquin Phoenix. Directed by Terry George.By far this is one of the best Biopics since Taylor Hackford did 'Ray'. The story is a Hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle, in his Oscar calibrated performance along with his acting in Assassination of Richard Nixon) keeps Tutsis refuges in his four star Hotel from the Hutu rebels on the outside.As he risks his life to save the lives of many, with the help of Nick Nolte whom as he helps Paul but also doesn't care. The movie shows that Cheadle is becoming one of our better actors and is rising up through the ranks to somewhere around Paul Giamatti caliber. Terry George the director/ writer with the aid of Keir Pearson do a fantastic job of recreating the havoc of 1994.'Hotel Rwanda' is beautiful, inspiring and very compelling on Cheadle's performance. This is one of the year's best movies and one of the best I have ever see. Bravo!",10,3,4,6 June 2005

(Cameo by Bruce Willis)The gang is back the Mastermind Danny Ocean (Clooney), Rusty Ryan (Pitt), a pick-pocket Linus Caldwell (Damon), the blackjack dealer Frank Catton (Mac), Danny's ex Tess (Roberts), the Asian guy that bends Yen (Qin), Bashar Tarr (Cheadle) and of course the tight-ass casino owner (Garcia).Now that Terry Benedict (Garcia) has found all the crooks that heisted his money he has given them two weeks to pay it back oh and of course plus interest. Seeing as how they are too hot to work in America they fly off to Amsterdam.Ocean's twelve is a deserving sequel. A free for all of laughs and witty humor, not to mention the ever beautiful Catherine Jeta-Jones. Steve directs one of the better sequels, but the story lacked in the action. It had the relative plot twist of what you don't expect, yet the movie lacked in one key area. The area being entertained, they put on quiet a show but not good enough. The first is still better but Ocean's twelve is a close call. For now it will be second place. My final rating 7/10.",7,1,1,18 April 2005

Written and Directed by Paul Haggis.Paul Haggis again writing another spell bounding script the other being Million Dollar Baby which he passed off to Clint Eastwood winning four academy awards yet this one he co-writes with Bobby Moresco and directs. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie won even more than four academy awards. The story about different people on a cold Los Angeles night and how their equally tragic stories all collide to make the years best film. Containing such rememberal characters like a racist cop (Dillon), a good partner (Phillipe), a black detective (Cheadle), a business man (Fraser), his beautiful wife (Bullock), two car jackers (Bridges) and (Tate) a director (Howard), his wife (Newton), and a lock salesman (Pena). Haggis takes a compelling look at racism and makes one of the most dramatic movies of the year. Quite possibly better than Million Dollar Baby. My final rating 10/10.",10,7,17,18 September 2005
Nacho Libre," Black gets his ya-ya's out in this comical treat, Jimenez is the real star
","*** Jack Black, Ana De la Reguera, Hector Jimenez, Darius Rose, Eduardo Gomez, Cesar Gonzalez. Directed by Jared Hess From the minds of 'Napolean Dynamite' the Hess duo comes back with a nice comical treat 'Nacho Libre'. When a dim witted holy man (Black) turns his ways and becomes a Lucha Libre with street trash (Jimenez) the two form a comical bond. Nacho also tries to win the heart of a pretty nun (Reguera) who can only see him as a friend until Nacho begins to fight for the children of an orphanage. 'Nacho Libre' is a bit stupid at times and should be meant for kids of say 12 but I over all liked the movie and can say *I* laughed.",7,0,4,2 July 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," (UN)fabulous! Ironically 'Devil' has no style of sense of fashion, Streep turns in an Oscar worthy role
","**1/2 Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, Tracie Thoms, Rich Sommer A bit trashed and wishy washy adaptation of the novel 'Devil' where a pretty woman (Hathaway) comes to the big city to become an assistant for a bitchy editor Miranda (Streep, an excellent Oscar nomination performance). While learning the tricks of the trade by gaining a sense of style and fashion (that the film lacks) she starts to become trusted and worthy. 'Devil wears Prada' is enjoyable is small doses and gives off a few chuckles but the end is over all predictable. And Streep gives a great performance as her role of the bitter hearted/work crazy editor that soon forms a well worked out bond. Worthy of a rental and no more than that",5,0,0,2 July 2006

Zemeckis again takes you to a magical world of heart warming devotion and true human spirit as Forrest Gump (Gentle Hanks) a slightly gifted man sees the world through one magical experience after another.Through the heart of Vietnam with Lt. Dan (Shining Sinise) and around the world to his teenage sweetheart Jenny (Wright). Hanks leading this ensemble cast that is one of the 90's greatest films and one of the most devoted films and brilliantly written by Eric Roth based on the novel by Winston Groom. Of course in the creative mind of Zemeckis the movie was bound for greatness, and showing a Tim Burton like creativity escalating to six academy awards (Best Picture non the less).

Reilly, Alec Baldwin,Ian Holm, Alan Alda,Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Matt Ross, Adam Scott, Kelli Garner, Frances Conroy, Willem Dafoe. Directed by Martin Scorsese.Scorsese continues to shine. Still not best director. Sadly Marty didn't make the cut for best director instead Million Dollar Baby won. But in my opinion well it's a close call because Eastwood and Scorsese are two brilliant directors. Aside from the dexterous dialogue which was brilliantly written by John Logan and the crash sequences that featured the star Howard Hughes (DiCaprio) the movie is still fantastic. With the set design, costume and the special effects it just makes a good movie and when you put Martin Scorsese in charge of the movie you better believe it's going to be good. DiCaprio plays the mad man Howard Hughes who was the leader of Aviation in the 1930's-40's. But the best part is how charmingly insane ha was. How he worked non-stop on his planes. My final rating 8/10. Close but so far Scorsese, maybe next year.",9,2,3,28 May 2005
The Village," No more plot twists
",The Village is set in the 18th century and revolves around the people that live in the town. Surrounding the town is acres of woods. In the woods are scary monsters not aliens like in signs not apparitions like in the Sixth Sense but scary. After Noah Percy (Adrien Brody soon to be in the Jacket) a retarded man ventures in the woods and gives berries of the bad color (red) to Ivy Walker played by Bryce Dallas Howard Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)is assured that if he is not a threat to them they will let him pass through to other towns. As the movie goes into more depth on what they hell is wrong with the town. Ivy and Lucius become close friends. Noah (Brody) is jealous and stabs him twice. Ivy must now venture in the woods alone to the towns and get medicine for Lucius. Will she make it in time. Believe me it didn't look that way it took for ever to get there.The village is a poor attempt with too many plot changes. So it is my judgment to say that M. Night Shaymalan has run out of plot twist and is now done. My score for the village very low but 2/10.,6,3,6,1 March 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," 'Wrong turn' indeed, Greg Nicotero's effects are delightfully gruesome
","*** Aaron Stanford, Dan Byrd, Emilie De Ravin, Kathleen Quinlan, Robert Joy, Ted Levine. Directed by Alejandre AjaLets face it remakes are all the rage and we've already seen a bomber with 'When a Stranger Calls' kudos to Simon West. But Aja's 'Eyes' is one of the best remakes (of a horror movie to boot) I've seen in a long time. He adds himself new parts that honestly made me jump, I haven't seen a horror movie that made me jump in a very long time, it's was delightful. The story of a family traveling through the remote desert to get to San Deigo which are soon sent into hell. When their car crashes and breaks down in the middle of nowhere (sure it's been done before but remains interesting) the family is stuck and left to wait. A band of radioactive mutants (! attacks the family and leaving them traumatized. The trailer seen is one of the most horrific scenes in the movie, especially for the 1977 Wes Craven version.My personal favorite was he mutated effects done by genius artist Greg Nicotero, Tom Savini himself couldn't have done a better job. Again Nicotero working with Robert Joy who was in last years 'Land of the Dead'. And the duo go hand in hand, Joy delivers the acting while Nicotero helps make it more terrifying.",6,2,4,13 March 2006

","**** Steve Carrel, Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, Abigail Bresling. Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie FarisWe've seen this concept before there's no doubt about that, but we have not seen this take on it. Newcomers Dayton and Faris prove to be a great talent when packing an ensemble cast that just bursts with comic genius, kudos to Oscar worthy Carrell. Not to leave anyone else out, including Collette and maybe a nod for Kinnear who just plays it off like he is so smart and wonderful, a true jackassAfter a low on life Uncle (Carrell) commits suicide and fails, he moves back in with his sister (Collette) and her husband (Kinnear). Along with their son (Dano) who's committed to a vow of silence, Grandpa (Arkin) who's up on heroin and their sweet daughter (Breslin, another talent to watch). When the good news about her getting into a beauty contest arrives, it brings the bad news as well. This out of touch family has to bond while treading the states in a broken down VW bus. This screenplay is original, and does not depend on swearing the laughs off. Instead it uses shear joy and the simplicity of this family as the tool. They may be unbelievably stupid and moronic but they are a family nonetheless. 'Sunshine' is perfect in every single way, I laughed, I grew with these characters. I think it should get a few Oscar nods, and am very happy that my theater picked up this Sundance film. Hands down, the one film you must see all year long",10,3,7,24 August 2006

Carell stars in and co-writes with the director (Judd Apatow) in the years flat out funniest film of the year. The story surrounding a normal guy Andy Stitzer (Carell) with a forty-year-old secret. He's a virgin. His friends Jay (Malco), Cal (Rogen) and David (Rudd; who stared in Anchorman with Carell) try to help him lose his virginity to some drunk chicks. Instead Andy hooks up with a regular girl Trish (Keener) who wants an honest relationship. Judd Apatow and Carell make hands down the funniest film of the year! The movie has everything a comedy could want and more. Bursting with raunchy humor and explicate sex dialogue makes every line funnier than the last. Bravo on Carell, Apatow, Rudd and Rogen's part on making this comedy. My final rating 10/10.",9,19,35,4 September 2005

Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance as a stir crazy marine facing the insanity of war and pressure to kill. Unbelievably Sarsgaard gives one of the best performances to date, his over all acting was phenomenal and made the movie all the more sweeter and very dramatic. The movie following marine sniper Swoff (gyllenhaal) and his counter partner troy (Shinning Sarsgaard) as they battle heat, depression and their Staff Srgt. (Foxx, doing his best to recreate a Lee Ermy styled dictatorship in Full Metal Jacket). Mendes surely is one of the finest directors around and makes lightning strike three times in a row with the help of his actors and the photography team. Even the setting plays a character in his third film. Bravo on everyone's part, especially Sarsgaard who will surely win best supporting actor. My final rating 9/10.",8,2,5,6 November 2005

Bale makes a huge blow in this epic thriller as an insomnia stricken blue collar worker Trever Reznick who begins to question his own sanity as he plunges deeper and deeper into this mind numbing mystery that echoes of a Hitchcock twist. Director Anderson does a phenomenal job directing the stars and Bale gives 110 percent losing sixty-something pounds to be the lightweight paranoid Trevor, not surprised if he wins best actor. A truly deep and dark tale that is sure to keep you guessing to the last dramatic scene. Leigh also plays a fine tuned prostitute, great acting all around. My props to Bale for giving new meaning to above and beyond acting. My final rating 9/10.",9,1,1,10 December 2005
Meet the Fockers," Focking hilarious.
","Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Steisand, Teri Polo, Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach.Male nurse Greg 'Gaylord' Focker (Stiller) returns to take the Byrnes family Ex-CIA agent Jack Byrnes (De Niro, showing it's never to late to switch from Scorsese films to comedy) to meet his family. Greg to talk about their engagement between himself and Pam Byrnes (Polo) never really happens acause of the nutjob Focker family. Including who else Rain Man or Dustin Hoffman as his loose complete opposite of Jack father Bernie Focker.Roach's new smash hit comedy soars big with me. Not surprised most of his films are funny except for the Peter Segal movie 50 first dates he helped produce I believe (don't quote me). Stiller and all the other academy award winners pitch in to make this movie Focking hilarious. My final rating 8/10.",6,0,0,25 April 2005
Ghost Rider," A LIVING HELL (on wheels to boot!)
","Due to the recent comic book adaptation craze including 'Superman' and 'Spiderman', 'Ghost Rider' is no different. Unless you read the comics (which I haven't) there is nothing to compare it to. For me it's a cheesy, poorly crafted piece of overly redundant CGI garbage which results in nothing more than 10 seconds action sequences and over the top talk-talk-talking about 'being the rider'. The only time the screen justly held my attention was when Nic Cage first changes and the few scenes that don't concentrate on his stupid Nemesis Blackheart. The villains are lame, the effects were even worse than 'The Hulks', and Eva Mendes had nothing more to do than show off some cleavage. Over all skip-able and way to hyped up, lets pray to god there isn't a sequel but with Hollywood adapting every comic there is, chances are 2008 can call for 'Ghost Rider 2' - **",4,0,1,17 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," 'Stand' tall and deliver indeed, Exciting, eye dazzling, popcorn summer blockbuster! Ratner does not disappoint
","***1/2 Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Kelsey Gramer, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Shawn Ashmore, Jamse Mardsen. Vinnie Jones and Cameron Bright. Directed by Brett RatnerComic fans rejoice, the X-men are back and in full form. After a certain buzz with Brett Ratner taking the director's helm after Bryan Singer didn't come back. And I must say the buzz is good, Ratner does not disappoint and this may be my favorite 'X-men' movie to date. Ratner brings in new mutants and we grow into more depth on a few of them. After a cure is found through the genes of a little child (Bright) the government decide to take charge and administer the cure to all willing. But Magneto (McKellen) enables an army of mutants and with great wrath decide to over throw the cure with force. Leading to a righteous battle at the climax of the movie. And once deceased Jean Grey (Janssen) comes back with her alter ego Phoenix raging all hell on those who get in her way. Luckily for McKellen this is his second summer movie and long awaited to after last weeks 'Da Vinci Code' opened up. So he'll be getting a nice little pay check this month for his sky rocketing sales at the theaters. I'll admit the movie was not long and we could have used more depth into some character study but Ratner pulls it off. With showing us Kelsey Gramer's angry side as he pounces Magneto's army as Beast. A far different side from his show 'Fraiser' but Gramer still has that clever tongue of his.The effects are well done, I was looking forward to all of May's releases 'MI:3', 'Poseidon', 'Da Vinci Code' and 'X-men' and after viewing them all 'X-men' is the right choice. While other summer block busters to be left me cold and bored 'X-men' does the deed to make 2006 a promising year in comic book adaptations as well as Singer's 'Super Man Returns' movie. Which hopefully won't disappoint, but with Singer he has yet to do so. So I guess it's too early to tell.",6,3,8,27 May 2006
Hellboy," Guillermo gives fire and brimstone a new meaning
","Starring Ron Perlman, Rupert Evans, Doug Jones, John Hurt, Karel Roden, Selma Blair. Directed by Guillermo Del Toro.Based on another marvel comic book Guillermo most likely directs the best movie he ever made. Since this was not his first comic book movie after doing Blade 2 with Wesley Snipes as the star, he must have some experience with comic book movies in this particular movie his true director identity was not only show but proved. Ron Perlman after doing Alien Resurrection (The worst of the four by the way) in which Sigourney is the eighth Ripely he stars as Hellboy a bad ass demon hunter traveling around in a garbage truck with Abe Sapien (Jones) a mermaid or fish of sorts with a high intellect. As soon as a new body guard or so Rupert Evans (Myers) joins the team to help Hellboy he at first is disliked but soon learns the ropes and finds the inner peace and sensuality of him along with fighting old dead Nazis and watching Hellboy beat up some giant monsters. Hellboy is most likely Guillermo's best film he ever did and maybe some pity him for that but I applaud him for making and giving the true identity of a marvel comic book hero.

If not for Dennis Leary and Ray Romona's voices the movie would have been a total loss. The worst of Birds directing career to date.On the other hand 'The Incredibles' is not his worst but possibly his best. Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Nelson)is being sued by a suicidal man who did not want to be saved by him. Losing the case Mr. Incredible is forced to live a normal life.

Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood and Haggis make a good team.
","Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank, Jay Baruchel, Mike Colter, Lucia Rijker. Written by Paul Haggis. Directed by Clint Eastwood.Eastwood and Haggis make a good team.Normally I don't care for Boxing movies like Rocky's 1-5 but I made and exception for Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby and later on Cinderella Man. The story is two men that own a gym when a troubled waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank, a surprising bolster in the actress category) waltzes in their gym and wants to be trained by Frankie Dunn (Eastwood; also the director). After her plea for his help he gives in along with the co-owner Morgan Freeman. Who makes a good sidekick and helps make the movie more enjoyable. Even though the screenplay written by Paul Haggis (who will later go on to make Crash) was fantastic and one of the best boxing screenplays since Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin did Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull screenplay. Overall the movie had a great script with capricious dialogue along with just plain good acting on Eastwood, Freeman, and Swank's part. My final rating 10/10.",10,4,6,3 June 2005

","**1/2 Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Erik Knudsen, Dina Meyer, Franky G, Glenn Plummer. Directed by Darren Lynn BousmanDespite the doubt of a sequel surpassing the original (which it doesn't) or the attempt to measure up, 'Saw 2' does. Leigh Whannel going out on a limb with out James Wong but substituting for him director Darren Lynn Bousman. A fine choice indeed. This time friendly serial killer and life teacher Jigsaw (Bell) pits eight strangers in a house while they breathe in deadly nerve agents. While Detective Mathews attempts to hunt down his son who is also one of the eight. 'Saw 2' doesn't fail on blood and creativity but it does the exact opposite, it brings wholesome torture and life back to killings on the screen. Most horror films fail to deliver the goods or a decent story line, 'Saw 2' packs both. No it's not as good as the original but a lot better than I would think for what it is.

","Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, William Atherton, Chad Lindberg, Ray Godshall Sr., Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn. Directed by Edward Zwick.Zwick has given us one of my favorite movies in the 80's, in 1989 Zwick directed Glory (A civil war movie that follows the 54th black regiment) but in 2003 he did The Last Samuri. The story revolves around a civil war vet in the 1800's Nathan Algren (Cruise in one of his better performance's since Michael Mann's Collateral). Nathan is sent to Japan to help the Japs defend of the Samuri, whom are being a real pain in the ass. Cruise being beaten in battle is now captured by them and learns their way of life from their leader Katsumoto (Watanabe). Nathan's eyes are opened to see who truly is the worse of the two, he is turned against the Japaniese and fights in one of the biggest sword swing, horse riding battles of all time (Just my opinion). Cruise and Watanabe give an electrifying performance in Edward Zwick's masterpiece The Last Samuri. My final rating 8/10. Gives the crowd what it wants to see.",7,0,1,27 March 2005
Invincible," The only thing INVINCIBLE is this predictable story, Wahlberg does what he can with a tired football vehicle
","** Mark Wahlberg, Greg Kinnear, Elizabeth Banks, Kevin Conway, Dov Davidoff. Directed by Ericson Core. We've seen this whole set up before, an underdog defies the team and does the impossible by achieving his dream in baseball, basketball or in this case football. This time the schmuck is Wahlberg who when a cruddy team holds open try outs they draft Wahlberg. Of course going over the clichéd obstacles of the other team mates and just making the cut with a new coach (Kinnear). This whole set up is predictable and the wigs are laughable, some of the look like cheap toupees found on the sidewalk. The only thing INVINCIBLE about this is the story line which keeps going and going every year down from 'Remember the Titans'. Disney continues to prove dreams do come true, maybe next year so will mine, END IT. Although I did like the cinematography, the playing in the rain and the symbolism of those scene and friendship. But after two long hours of nonstop training and running the movie much like the acting and everything else here gets tired. I don't hate sports movies but am biased against them like earlier this years 'Glory Road'. The all follow the same aspects in that genre. 'Invincible' can only go so far before it stops",5,2,9,25 August 2006

To be honest at first I thought this movie looked like a piece of crap since it has something to do with Walt Disney. I figured can an action film be good if it has something to do with Disney cause you have some big stars in here that have been in action films Cage, Voight, Keitel. But no I was proved wrong, National Treasure surprisingly was good it was worth seeing. But in 2005 they made a knock-off of National Treasure, Sahara this movie I refuse to see. Lets compare you have the leader Cage and McConaughey, the beautiful woman Kruger and Cruz, the goofy sidekick Baratha and Zahn. Seems oddly identical don't ya think. My final rating 7/10.

The Descent," DESCENT into madness; what's great about this is it claims to be terrifying...and it is
","**** Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring, Nora-Jane No one. Directed by Neil Marshall. Possibly the best and scariest horror film I have seen in dog years, this does what 'The Cave' could not. When a cave expedition amongst friends goes wrong, leaving them trapped under the surface a group of hungry predators make their mark. Even though 'The Descent' is a horror film it works really well as a thriller, surprisingly it has a good footing and a smart background. Writer and director Marshall uses great camera work with both his and a camcorder to bring that edgy feeling. Even though it is set in the darkness of the cave there is still enough lighting to show the gruesome acts which take place. I loved and enjoyed every gory minute of this blood fest, Mendoza was my personal favorite of the group",8,3,6,17 August 2006

Directed by Spike Lee.Always controversial Spike Lee with his typical racial remarks, again pulls it off. With a comedic edge to it of course. And sure the movie starts out as typical, men breaking into the bank and threatening everyone to get to the floor, there is no way passed that. Despite a few cliché' actions and threats between Detectives 'Man' pulls off the ultimate heist, convincing the audience this is real.Slick Dalton Russell (Owen, in a real bad ass role) has the perfect plan to rob a bank and make away with a hefty score. But Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) who plays along with Dalton's deviated game of cat and mouse soon realizes it is more than what it seems. With Madeline White (Foster; pitch perfect as always) trying to project a few assets of her own and her employer (Plummer).'Inside Man' may be a total cliché off of 'Dog Day Afternoon' and hundreds of other heist movies but it works. Despite a few untied edges and some things that just don't play out as well, it formulates into a good movie. With one of my favorite actresses in it, Foster who nearly every time I see her is cunning and portrays her character with a wholesome edge to it.",7,4,6,26 March 2006

I for one have not read the book so I won't continuously talk about it in comparison but what I do have to say is, if the movie is anything like the book I won't be reading it very soon. As was everyone, I was excited about Ron Howard's adaptation and teaming with his producer-pal Brian Grazer, how could they fail?Robert Landon (Hanks) an ingenious professor in the art of symbols is called away to investigate a murder in the (gorgeous) Louvre. With Sophie Neveu (Tautou) helping him along the way, they may find a secret leading them to the paintings of Leonardo DaVinci. Which may in turn shake down the forever truth on Jesus Christ and Christianity. As a cop (Reno) tries to take him down for the murder inside the Louvre, Langdon seeks aid from his aging pal (McKellen). Together they try to spring the trap and discover the truth or just crack the code.I was indeed disappointed by 'DaVinci Code' I was mislead and may have misread the trailer. Most of the scenes, not including the ones with DaVinci's artwork, dragged on and on with no end. The movie was a little boring and not worth the buzz let alone the 2 hours and 30 minutes of Church gossip. If you want a lecture on history, open up a text book and look the stuff up rather then sit in a chair for hours on end watching Hanks in his new haircut.",6,1,4,19 May 2006

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas saved the best for last.
","Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee (Voices of Matthew Wood, James Earl Jones, Frank Oz) Directed by George Lucas.The epic story line comes to its conclusion. What a rush! This I must say is the most excited I've been for a movie since the remake of Dawn of the Dead. After reading review after review and seeing people saying that Phantom menace and Attack of the clones were dull and lame and that the originals were better. Well of course the originals are better they're classics, a new age movie holds no comparison to a classic.And I disagree, they weren't terrible I think they were necessary for Revenge of the Sith to be so successful and to be the epic finish of the summer let alone the whole year!Lucas finally put his money where his mouth is, he made the digital effects something out of this world. The light saber fights were the greatest compared to the 1977, 1980, and 1983 versions. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that McGregor and Christensen could go so fast without delay and a mistake. Let alone the starfighters and the planets were numerous lightsaber fights were held.Of course you must know the story line, this is the fatal decision of Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) as he turns to the dark side and betrays his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor) thus turning him into the epitome of evil Darth Vader. Voiced by the greatest voice James Earl Jones who returns to send chills up your spine and once again strike fear into little kids.I got goose bumps when Vader took his first breathe and his Iron Lung did the greatest sound ever made.What made the movie such a hit was that you knew what was going to happen but because you knew you wanted to see the movie even more. This is when Yoda (Oz) fights Darth Sidious (McDiarmid) and is forced into hiding where he later teaches Luke Skywalker in Empire Strikes Back. This is when Padme, Anakin's secret wife gives birth to Luke and Leia and dies in labor making them orphans. This is when Anakin becomes Darth Vader.One of the best part of the movie are the fights. Especially the ones with General Grievous (Voiced by Wood). The worst part about Grievous was he was always coughing and weezing all the villains in this movie seem to have a cold. But between Darth Vader, Darth Sidious, and a four light saber swinging General.I have waited for this moment for a long time and am now heart struck to see it disappear but happy so I don't have to sit another two hours. You have now figured out the origin of Luke and Leia the origin of Darth Vader. I applaud you Lucas, thanks for a wild ride and what a rush it was. My final rating 10/10.",9,3,7,21 May 2005

","In Taylor Hackfords new film Ray (Foxx) stars as blind jazz musician Ray Charles Robinson. Ray went blind at age seven after his little brother George drowns in his mothers wash tub. Ray started to play at night clubs and played other songs already written like Nat King Cole. After asked to do his first record he switches his last name to Charles which is his middle name because there was already a Robinson musician. Ray went through many struggles during his career like drugs and seeing or feeling his dead brothers corpse. Ray is an inspirational movie with music and drama from such a great director Taylor Hackford. Foxx shows his dramatic side and plays Ray as if he were him. Hackford moves up the director scale and shows his serious side. This truly is his best movie and one of the years best, Foxx deserves the Oscar.Surprisingly Foxx gives his second good performance of 2004. The first him playing Max in Michael Mann's Collateral.

","**1/2 Nicolas Cage, Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan, Ian Holm, Kobus Marx, Jasper Lenz. Directed by Andrew Niccol. Opposite satire of a normal action packed gun fire flick from Cage where this time his charm does no good, on the other hand I did enjoy Jared Leto's work in 'War'. A new story plot that fires off a lot of rounds to make an impact towards the audience but in the end they are all blanks. Trigger happy gun salesman Yuri (Cage) begins examining his life when his wife (Moynahan) starts to dwell about her commitment towards Yuri. And an Agent (Hawke, a disappointing role for Ethan) is hot on his trail as Yuri goes through different encounters to the countries he sells firearms to. Niccol made a nice attempt at a mobster, gang like film but fails in the end. 'Lord of War' is nothing more than a summer blocker buster (if that) that tries to stir up feelings towards the characters and meanwhile let them enjoy wholesome gun fire. Mediocre attempt overall, My final rating 7/10",7,0,3,12 March 2006

Based on the true story of Viktor Navorski (Hanks;in his impressive role as an illegal alien) who gets stuck in an airport in New York and can't risk to step a foot out in N.Y without being arrested. While there he be-friends a flight attendant Amelie Warren (the beautiful Zeta-Jones) who he happens to have his eye on. Spielberg makes even the worst sounding movie one of the best of the year. Bravo on Hanks and Spielberg's part.",8,66,108,18 July 2005
Identity," Finally Cusack separates himself from the love comedies.
","John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Clea Duvall, and William Lee Scott. Directed by James Mangold.After waiting six years since Simon West's Con Air for John Cusack to do a movie other than the corky love comedies he pulls through with Identty. Whether he play a witty record salesman (High Fidelity) or a struggling hit man (Grosse Pointe Blank) but now he steals the show as a limo driver (well technically I thought Liotta stole the show).The story is set in a Nevada motel during a horrible rain storm causing ten complete strangers to battle out the storm. But as they begin to get to know each other the killing starts. Identity is a pulse pumping thriller and a mind game leaving you guessing until the end of the film. One of the best thrillers since The Usual Suspects. My final rating 8/10.",9,0,1,27 March 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," Alive and loving (almost) every minute of it, the infamous McClane is back and better than before!
","Running on nearly 20 years Bruce Willis's infamous rough and tough N.Y.P.D officer McClane is back and up against a new nemesis. When a Cyber terrorist threatens to fire sale the Country it's up to none other than John and his newest sidekick (Long, he's no Jackson but manages to live up to the title) to save the day. Sadly the damn MPAA has wrongfully put 'Die Hard' under PG-13 where as apposed to it's predecessors had the wonderful R rating. You would think this would be outrageous which at times it is, there's no cursing and McClane's quote is nearly spoken in a whisper. But the action remains as sturdy and entertaining as McTernian left off in 88. Although a few sequences are a little too popcorny for me when they should be intense and hardcore. Despite being the 4th film it's good, on par with the original even. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is fun, action packed, comical and the plot is a little creepy when you think about it. ***",8,3,7,4 July 2007
Munich," Spielberg's darkest chapter to date, Bana and Rush give performances of there career's, one of the years most horrifically intriguing and compelling films
","**** Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, Hanns Zischler, Ayelet Zorer. Directed by Steven Spielberg World renowned director Steven Spielberg's newest and darkest film 'Munich' has Oscar caliber written all over it. Based on the true events in 1972 when Palestinian terrorists kill Israeli athletes and hired Mossad agent along with a crack team of specialists go after them leading up to a horrific aftermath. Bana and Rush give some of there best career performances thus far, a compelling look at near minded destruction and a few state of the art explosions along with it. Spielberg has out done himself with one of the years best and one of the greatest films in general, a definite multi nominee for a few academy awards. My final rating 10/10.",9,2,5,3 January 2006
Fantastic Four," Far from 'Fantasic', another lame attempt at a Hollywood comic blockbuster
","1/2 Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, Julian McMahon. Directed by Tim StoryAnother Hollywood attempt to make every popular comic into a boring, overused CGI block buster, of course a miss. Along with the direction of usual comedic director Tim Story who seems to be out of his genre with this action film. Along with most of the actors/actresses who's charming personalities don't quite add up to the superhero they are to play (i.e Chiklis and Alba). The story of five astronauts who encounter a slight mis-hap on their space adventure when their DNA structure is reformed to give them superpowers, transforming them into the (Far from) Fantastic Four. Mr. Fantastic (Gruffudd), The Invisible Woman (Alba), Human Torch (Evans), and the Thing (Chiklis) who battle their arch nemesis Dr. Doom (McMahon; another reason he should stick to Nip/Tuck). The whole movie has about three scenes where the scene can be done with out tons of bad CGI and ILM. And of course giving the props to creator Stan Lee as Hulk, Spider-Man. The movie is far from 'Fantastic' and leaves me guessing why Story for the director? My final rating 1/2/10.",1,1,3,10 December 2005
Sin City," A 'Sin' to miss.
","**** Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Clark Duncan, Jaime King, Rutger Hauer, Mickey Rourke. Directed by Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino. Based on the Dark Horse comics Sin City thought up by Frank Miller made into a motion picture by Robert Rodriguez and the creator Miller who co-directs along side with him and Tarantino. The movie shot in classic black and white (which proves movies look better in black and white) and sceams of color illuminating each brilliantly shot sequence and one scene directed by Tarantino. The movie being made early in the year but is definitely one of 2005 best of. Great movie, great comic, and one of the years best. My final rating 10/10.",9,4,8,25 July 2005
The Pursuit of Happyness," Pure Happiness, Smith turns Oscar worthy, one of the years absolute best
","**** Will Smith, Thandie Newton, Jaden Smith, Brian Howe, Dan Castellanta. Directed by Gabriele Muccino. After seeing the trailers for this movie and some of the sad scenes I was moved nearly to tears. Thankfully this is not just a sad movie, it has comedy and a joyful message. Not to say that there are not a few tear jerking scenes but 'Pursuit' is not one note, it at least moves around and has a chance to give an inspirational outlook. A struggling salesman (Smith, shoe in for a best Actor nod) after losing his wife (Newton) is down on life, when he tries to make a better one for him and his son (Smith) he tries to land an internship for stock broking. 'Pusuit' for me is absolutely outstanding, it is a very emotional film and thankfully more than just one. One of the years best",9,1,4,16 December 2006
V for Vendetta," 'Freeeeedom', 'Vendetta' dazzles the eyes and explodes on the big screen, Portman continues to excel
","*** Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, Ben Miles, Rupert Graves. Directed by James McTeigue Most comic book adaptations are mediocre and fail to stay true to the basis in which was created. But 'V' like last years 'Sin City', also based on a graphic novel, does not disappoint and stays true to the novels. In the futuristic world where a totalitarian government rules London but when a man known as V (Weaving) uses terroristic tactics to over throw the government and the leader (Hurt, as always great). Along side of a helpless citizen Evey (Portman, a shinning star) they teach each other valuable lessons throughout. Two great screenwriters Andy/Larry Wachowski bring 'V' to the screen. They do a great job writing the dialogue and action scenes which never fail to bore. Dashes of British humor make 'V' one of 2006's best movies, sure to be a classic eye dazzler. My final rating 8/10",8,3,6,19 March 2006
