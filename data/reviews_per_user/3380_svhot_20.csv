Blade Runner 2049," Best Sequel Ever , Great Acting, Great Direction, NICE Story-Screenplay
","'Blade Runner 2049' is definitely one of the best and most outstanding sequels ever made in the history of cinema / movie-making. The basic plot is about a new blade runner known as K (Ryan Gosling), who is given the task of locating and 'retiring / executing ' the child of a deceased replicated being. His hunt for the replicated-child leads him to confrontations and interactions with various 'people'. This includes his interaction with the original veteran blade runner Deckard (Harrison Ford). Deckard is the father of the replicated-child.The story is told mostly in a thriller-style and the real child's identity is revealed towards the end of the movie.Firstly, I have to write about the outstanding work done by the director Denis Villeneuve. Denis has managed to accomplish a rare feat in movie-making ; he has connected the plot with the story of the original Blade Runner, while creatively taking the plot forward with a fresh style and intriguing elements and characters. Denis has maintained the intense and dark atmosphere of the predecessor movie, while the ' thriller style ' of taking the story forward will keep viewers interested and involved till the end of the movie. Wow, you are really one of the best directors ever and your name should definitely be mentioned in the 'top 10 directors of all times' records.The acting of the entire star-cast is great in this movie. Ryan Gosling has played his role to perfection as the 'new blade runner ' agent known as K. His mannerisms,and the intensity displayed by him through his eyes and expressions are simply outstanding. Harrison Ford is impressive once again as the veteran blade runner Deckard. Mr Ford is a natural actor ; he always tries to react how people would in real life, if put in certain situations and circumstances. This is the best thing about the legendary Mr Harrison Ford (Cheers Sir, and thanks for reprising your role as the iconic blade runner !!!!) The visuals and special effects are also of good quality and look genuine. The story and screenplay are also well developed and quite intriguing. However, the only thing that I did not like was 'allowing the new blade runner K to die in the end '. It would have been better if K had stayed alive. I would love to become a 'story-screenplay ' writer for movies, because interesting stories keep developing in my mind all the time (Yes, I am telling the truth - literally !!!!).

50 First Dates," '50 First Dates' is one of the best modern romantic-comedies made so far
","This movie, '50 First Dates', is Adam Sandler's crowning glory ; it is definitely the best role, and the best performance of his career so far. People who are skeptical about Sandler's acting talent should watch this movie - their doubts will definitely be cleared. Plus, there is the vivacious , dreamy-eyed female Drew Barrymore to watch . The chemistry between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is definitely worth a watch. In fact, they will be remembered as one of the best on-screen couples in a romantic-comedy (rom-com, as it is frequently referred to these days).Adam plays Henry Roth, a man who lives in Hawaii, and he is afraid of getting in a permanent, committed relationship, until the time when he meets Lucy(Drew Barrymore). They hit it off almost instantly, but the next day she does not even recognize him. This is due to her short-term memory loss - she forgets everything while she sleeps at night ; when she wakes up in the morning, her mind keeps returning to a particular day in a particular year. Henry, despite the fact that he has the skill to get any woman, decides that he wants to be with Lucy - regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for 'the first time' everyday. He even helps her to move on by telling her the truth about her memory problem.This is a really brilliant movie. It is full of fun - for instance, the things that Lucy's family members do to hide the truth about her memory problem, the way that Adam (Henry) intercepts and interrupts their everyday plans to reveal the truth to Lucy, and so on. However, the real flavor of '50 First Dates' lies underneath the humour - it is so unbelievably romantic. This quality makes it one of the best 'feel-good' factor movies ever made.",10,1,2,9 January 2019
Training Day," Training Day is an edge-of-the-seat thriller,and features stellar performances
","'Training Day' is an action thriller, but that is not the end of the story, because it is much more than that. Before I elaborate further, first of all let me highlight the fact that this movie features stellar performances by Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. These two actors take the viewers on a journey that entertains and thrills, shocks and mesmerizes, and it will feel very real.As I said earlier, 'Training Day' is an action thriller, but it is an excellent one. The reasons that it feels very real is because we all know that a certain level of corruption exists in cop work, that seems unavoidable at times, due to certain reasons. I said reasons, therefore, I would like to mention that it also feels realistic because of Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington ' s genuinely outstanding, mind-blowing performances.Hawke plays a rookie cop who is being 'trained' by a senior cop that Washington enacts. As the movie progresses, viewers will realize that this is definitely no ordinary training day in the life of a rookie cop ; there is definitely a mystery behind the action and procedures that Washington is instructing Hawke to do. The movie is full of surprises and excitement, suspense and mystery, and 'garnished' with good action sequences. David Ayer has written an excellent cop-thriller story, and director Antoine Fuqua has presented it on-screen brilliantly, and almost flawlessly. 'Training Day' will always be remembered as one of the best cop-action / crime thrillers ever made in the history of cinema.",10,0,1,26 December 2018
John Wick," Keanu Reeves most iconic character portrayal as the dangerous 'John Wick'
","'John Wick' is an excellent action entertainer. However, it's not only that ; it is also very dark, intense , violent in an enjoyable way, and its action coordination is sharp and engaging. Keanu Reeves will always be remembered as the iconic 'John Wick' ; similar to Sylvester Stallone's iconic characters of 'Rocky' and 'Rambo', and Arnorld's iconic 'Terminator' role.The basic story revolves around a former Hit-man named John Wick (Reeves), who is also known as 'The Boogey-Man'. When the son of a sophisticated gangster steals his car and kills his dog (the only remaining connection to Wick's recently deceased wife), John gets back to his 'killer' mode to take revenge. Keanu Reeves is simply outstanding, menacing, and totally convincing as the dangerous hit-man. His devilishly-heroic style in this movie has set a new benchmark for the future aspiring action heroes.The action sequences are well planned and perfectly executed by Keanu Reeves. Each action sequence is a feast for lovers of this genre. The direction is effective ; a dark and intense atmosphere has elevated the deadly nature of the criminal world shown in the movie. In conclusion, it is one of the best intense action thriller movies ever made.",10,1,1,9 November 2017
Rocketman," 'Rocketman' rocks, a good movie, good acting, great direction; but not for kids
","Ketman ' is a musical, fun fantasy (half true, half imaginary) movie about Sir Elton John. It is not a full facts biography movie. The makers of this movie have chosen to present the story in a partly fantasy style.'Rocketman' shows various highs and lows of Sir Elton's life ; his rise and popularity as a singer / musician and his struggles with issues and elements such as drugs, alcohol, and his sexuality. The acting, writing, and singing in this movie is top-class. Taron Edgerton is excellent as the on-screen version of Sir Elton John. His performance is almost flawless. His hard work and dedication can be seen and felt through his brilliant performance. The director has also done a great job in creating this unique movie.",8,2,7,24 May 2019
Wind River," Must go in historical records as one of the best whodunit thrillers
","'Wind River' is a very cleverly woven murder mystery thriller that will keep you engrossed and entertained from start-to-finish. This is definitely more than enough evidence to justify the fact that Taylor Sheridan is one of the best storytellers ever in the history of cinema. I know that I may sound like a lawyer after writing this line, but don't worry, I am not a lawyer or even a law student. I am one of those rare people who appreciates a great story and an intelligent storyteller.The basic plot of 'Wind River' is about a tracker/hunter (Jeremy Renner) and an agent (Olsen) who team up to investigate the murder of a Native American girl on a remote Native American reservation. Jeremy Renner is excellent in his portrayal of a tracker/hunter with a tragic past. An actor depends a lot on his/her eyes and expressions to convince viewers about the genuine nature of their performance/role in a movie. Jeremy Renner is simply outstanding with the feelings of guilt,anger,depression and frustration that he portrays through his eyes and expressions.Viewers can actually feel the pain in his eyes. Olsen has also given a decent performance in her role. She tries to prove herself in her own unique ways.Taylor Sheridan,the writer of 'Sicario', has made a creative whodunit thriller movie that definitely should go down in the historical records as one of the best and most unique murder mystery movies ever made. He begins the story in a small environment that develops and leads onto a bigger scheme as the movie progresses.He has attempted to show the type of misunderstandings that can arise when people from different cultures meet each other.I would love to become a story-screenplay writer for movie-makers.

Knives Out," ' Knives Out ' is a good, interesting whodunit mystery movie, good performances, great direction
","' Knives Out ' is really an intriguing whodunit mystery- thriller movie, with refreshing twists and turns. Daniel Craig, Chris Evans , Ana De Armas, and the rest of the ensemble cast have given genuinely good performances. The director has also made the movie in a brilliant style. The screenplay is very well plotted, and keeps viewers interested and involved from the beginning till the end.The locations are also great, and blend very well with the atmosphere required in a murder mystery movie. The dialogues of ' Knives Out ' have also been very well written. My favorite dialogue is when Chris Evans comments ' What are you? CSI - KFC? 'I highly recommend this movie - a must- watch for everyone.",10,2,14,1 December 2019
BlacKkKlansman," This movie is a rare masterpiece based on true events, excellent acting, clever direction
","This movie (Blackkklansman) is a viewer's delight. I would describe it as an excellent, funny, truth-buster ; it reveals a lot of dark secrets of its time, but it does so in a very entertaining, funny, witty, and clever manner.John David Washington gives an intense but humorous performance. He surely has acting talent and star value also. Adam Driver is equally good and outstanding in his performance. Mr. Spike Lee, the director, has done a very intelligent piece of movie-making on this modern-classic gem of a movie.",9,4,10,18 January 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great movie for all music lovers, whether you are a Queen fan or not, powerful performances
","This movie is a must-watch for all music lovers, regardless of the fact whether you are a fan of the iconic band Queen or not. ' The Bohemian Rhapsody' chronicles the journey and experiences of the members of the iconic music band Queen, leading to a grand finale / climax of one of their most popular concerts.Every aspect of making such a movie has been covered well. The story-screenplay is good, the performances of all the actors feel genuine, the producers have done an excellent job overall on making a movie that belongs to this genre, and the direction is simply outstanding. A certain number of critics are churning out negative comments and reviews about this movie , because they seem to be hunting for a documentary in a movie that simultaneously entertains, and also conveys the tension and problems that come along with becoming members of an iconic music band like Queen. If they want to watch a documentary, please tell them to watch it at their homes on television.The performances of all the actors in this movie is great. However, Rami Malek definitely stands out as Freddie Mercury. The director has done an excellent job and has managed to get powerful performances from such a huge star-cast.",9,3,5,7 November 2018
Before Sunset," 'Before Sunset' is a masterpiece - the perfect sequel to the best modern romance 'Before Sunrise'
","'Before Sunset' is genuinely a modern masterpiece in every aspect. Once again the great trio / dream team that consists of Ethan Hawke, Richard Linklater, and Julie Delpy showcase their magic on-screen so sweetly, that you will never want this movie to end. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have co-written the story/ screenplay of this great flick with director Richard Linklater.Ethan Hawke said in one of his interviews that 'Before Sunset is a romance for realists'. This statement basically summarises the movie in a capsule form. This movie continues the story of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after their first romantic interaction. The movie opens with Jesse giving an interview to journalists in Paris about a book that he recently wrote and had it published. The book features the romantic adventure of Jesse and Celine during their one night stay in Vienna.As Jesse is answering the various questions by journalists, he notices that Celine is standing nearby. He quickly ends the interview and goes to meet Celine. Viewers soon get to know the fact that Jesse did come to Vienna six months after their first meeting (just as they had planned and promised). However, Celine could not reach Vienna because she had to attend her grandmother's funeral. The two had not given each other their phone contact, address , etc - so Jesse never knew the reason for her absence in Vienna until now.As Jesse and Celine continue their conversation along the streets of Paris, we find out that a lot has happened in their lives within these nine years - Jesse is married and has a son, but he is still in love with Celine. Celine has had, in her own words, ' a lot of blah relationships', but she is also still in love with Jesse.They continue talking about a lot of issues. Finally, when Jesse is about to go to the airport with his designated driver, he offers to drop Celine at her home. When they arrive at Celine's home, Jesse walks with her inside, and asks her to sing one song. As Celine sings the 'waltz' song (Julie Delpy really sang this herself), it becomes very clear that she is still madly in love with Jesse, and vice versa. When Celine reminds Jesse that he will be late and miss the plane, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) smiles and says ' I know'. The movie ends with Celine freely dancing to music being played and Jesse still sitting there and smiling and admiring her.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have once again given such natural performances, that viewers will simply fall in love with them , and their romantic yet very realistic interaction with each other. The director, Mr Richard Linklater, once again proves the fact that he is one of the best movie-directors in the history of cinema.",10,0,0,14 December 2018
It Follows," Outstanding Horror Elements, Good Acting, Great Direction and Writing
","'It Follows' is definitely one of the better horror movies released in the last five years. It uses genuine elements to create an atmosphere of horror, as compared to the routine and clichÃ©d jump-scares. The plot revolves around a nineteen year old girl, Jay (M. Monroe) who gets haunted by an evil being after she has sex with a boy in his car. After their tryst, the boy reveals to her that he passed on a curse when they had intercourse ; now Jay must pass on the curse to someone else by having sex. If she doesn't, the evil spirit will kill her, and then come back to haunt the boy again. Jay teams up with her sister and friends to fight and defeat the evil spirit. Will they succeed in outwitting the evil being ?The direction and story-writing are excellent. The director has breathed new life into the horror genre. He has used mostly young actors and churned out brilliant performances from them. He has used the camera (s) quite cleverly also. The soundtrack / music of 'It Follows' is outstanding. The musical element elevates the horror to the highest level.I would love to become a story-writer for movies because intriguing stories develop in my mind all the time (Yes, I am telling the truth !!).

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Brad Pitt and Leonardo Di Caprio shine the brightest, Margot Robbie is sweet and sexy, and Quentin Tarantino has done his best work as a director in this movie
","' Once upon a time in Hollywood ' is clearly and definitely one of the best movies of year 2019.Brad Pitt has always given cool, realistic type of performances - in this movie, he has given his coolest performance ever. Leonardo Di Caprio has always been great at playing troubled, complicated personalities. In this movie, he plays a fading actor who is trying to give his career a much needed upward boost. Margot Robbie is sweet and sexy as Sharon Tate. Even Al Pacino has managed to make the best out of the few scenes he has in this movie set in the year 1969. The real King over here is definitely director Quentin Tarantino. I feel that this movie is his best work till date. Everything that he has done to make this movie entertaining seems genuine.",10,106,185,28 July 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," One of the most creative, intelligent science fiction thrillers ever made
","'The Adjustment Bureau' is highly creative and intelligent in terms of the story that is being conveyed to viewers. The concept that someone(apart from God) is trying to 'adjust' our daily lives according to a predetermined 'plan' is the greatest element of thrill in the story/ screenplay. It might come as a shock for some viewers. The plot moves forward at a decent pace and viewers will keep wondering what is going to happen next. Therefore, it definitely captures the interest and full attention of its viewer.The chemistry between the two main lead actors (Matt Damon and Emily Blunt)is outstanding, almost magical. Viewers can actually 'feel the love' between Matt Damon (Norris) and Emily Blunt (Elyse). Their on-screen chemistry is one of the major attractions of 'The Adjustment Bureau'. The movie is also visually appealing and edited brilliantly.I would love to become a full-time movie critic or a story-writer for movies because movies exist in every breath I take.

American Made," Award-Worthy Performance from Tom Cruise in a True Story Film
","'American Made' is the best American movie I have seen this year. There are a number of factors / reasons that I am saying so. The first reason is that Tom Cruise has given an outstanding performance in this masterpiece movie. Cruise plays real-life pilot Barry Seal, who is hired by the CIA in a covert operation against smugglers (and other 'enemies' of the state), from the year 1978 up till 1986. The hero / anti-hero nature of Barry Seal is portrayed with perfection on screen by Tom Cruise. Tom plays the character with such style, skill, panache ,wit and dare-devilry that you will never want this movie to end. He has given a rare blend of intensity and fun to his character in this movie.The second reason why I loved this movie so much is because the director Doug Liman, has made a very well crafted film that shines and is definitely superior than the other flicks of its time. Mr Liman has managed to fully capture the atmosphere and style of the period during which this true story transpired - 1978 to 1986. The color palette of every scene in 'American Made' has been given the 70s-80s look and feel. All the buildings shown, the cars used, the technology, and the clothes worn by actors have been utilized correctly to represent the style and trends of that time. Mr Doug Liman has garnished this movie with a 'sweet amount' of fun and wit, which further increases its attraction factor / quotient.The entire star-cast have given good performances. Apart from Cruise's acting, the other two actors who have shined brightly in 'American Made' are D. Gleeson (who plays Barry's CIA handler) , and Sarah Wright Olsen (who plays Barry's wife). Although Sarah did not get a lot of scenes, she is a real scene-stealer. She can make you laugh or cry by just using her facial expressions, as she did in a few scenes with Tom Cruise. I have to stop here, otherwise my review will become too long, and might not be accepted. I would love to become a story-screenplay writer for movies because intriguing stories keep developing in my mind all the time (Yes - I really mean it, literally !!!!).

Joker," 'Joker 2019' is definitely the best American movie of the year, Jaoquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar award for this
","'Joker' (2019) is an origin story for the super-villain character. After Heath Ledger's outstanding, haunting performance as the Joker in Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight', even I thought that it will be impossible for any actor to reach the highest of standards as the villainous Joker. Heath Ledger had set the level too high to reach, but the great, talented Jaoquin Phoenix has flown high and reached that exact highest of standard ; he definitely deserves all the awards for this performance in 'Joker', and so does the director of this movie.",9,0,1,20 October 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Nice Classic-Style Mystery Solving, Good Acting, Effective Direction
","'Murder on the Orient Express' is a nice look at how mysteries were solved by detectives in an era which had limited technology, as compared to the ultra-modern world of today, which has GPS trackers, hackers, and so many technology-based tools to assist the current detectives.Please, do not rely on the unnecessary and negative reviews given by many critics for this movie, who are unfairly comparing the film to Agatha Christie's original novel / book story. It is very challenging and brave to make a movie based on a novel and an author so popular, that more than half of the people living on earth know the original story. Yet, actor-director Kenneth Branagh has dared to accomplish this challenging task. Mr Branagh has done an excellent job, both as a director and an actor.Mr K. Branagh has taken a different approach to convey the mystery by changing a few elements and characters ; this has given this movie (and the story) a fresh touch. Kenneth Branagh has played the great Belgian detective Poirot himself.His performance is brilliant, and he has given the character of Poirot a realistic touch. Johnny Depp shines again in the role of a suspicious crook. Penelope Cruz is quite seductive and plays her role very well. All the other actors have also given good performances.I would love to become a story-writer for movies because intriguing stories develop in my mind all the time (Yes, I am telling the truth, and I am not crazy !!)

The Greatest Showman," Nice Feel-Good Musical Movie, Very Entertaining, Dazzling Performances, Good Direction
","'The Greatest Showman ' is a totally entertaining movie for lovers of musical-movies. The director and writers have taken the character of Barnum and put a sweet spin to his actual story. The alterations that have been made to Barnum's actual tale make this movie very refreshing. The songs are outstanding, the dance choreography is perfect, not even a minute of boredom is present, the acting is great. Hugh Jackman plays Barnum , a poor man , who gets the opportunity of getting married to the love of his life - Charity (Michelle Williams). Charity comes from a privileged family , and Barnum finally gets the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove his talents by opening a circus that soon becomes a huge sensation. However, due to his over-ambitious nature and personality, he fails to recognize the happiness that has been provided to him in the present ; he attempts to focus too much on the future. Hugh Jackman has given one of the finest (and perhaps sweetest) performances of his career. Michelle Williams also gives a good performance as his wife. The supporting cast have also given effective performances ; Zac Efron and Zendaya portray a young couple in love. The direction is also good.I would love to become a story-writer for movies because interesting stories keep developing in my mind all the time (Yes, I am telling the truth !!) .",8,7,15,22 December 2017
Before Sunrise," Before Sunrise is the most romantic movie ever made
","'Before Sunrise' is a movie that has achieved a very rare feat - it managed to be romantic yet very realistic at the same time. That is the reason why I feel that this is the most romantic movie I have seen so far. Rarely will viewers come across a movie that has got the correct blend of romance yet it stays very real and close to real life.The movie stars the brilliant Ethan Hawke as Jesse, a young American man and Julie Delpy as Celina, a young French woman. The two meet each other while travelling on a train in Europe. Jesse and Celina decide to spend a night together in the breathtakingly-beautiful city of Vienna. The experiences that they have together, the places they visit and spend time at, the people with whom they interact with, and the issues that they talk about with each other - are simply outstanding and excellent.The reason why the story and screenplay of 'Before Sunrise' is so good is the great director of this movie - Richard Linklater. Furthermore, the icing on the cake is the fact that the story of this movie has been inspired by Mr Linklater's real life experience and interaction that he had with a woman, while travelling on a train. I recommend that this movie must be seen by everyone at least once (minimum), as well as its two sequels - 'Before Sunset' and ' Before Midnight'",10,0,0,2 December 2018
Green Book," A genuine masterpiece movie based on a true story
","'Green Book' is a movie that tells viewers about the friendship of pianist Don Shirley, and his Italian-American driver. Ali and Viggo Mortensen have given outstanding, memorable performances in their respective roles.The direction is excellent. The best thing about this movie is the fact that it teaches viewers a lot of good lessons without preaching. The director uses natural moments and incidents to convey the themes that this movie wants to present to its viewers.",9,2,4,6 January 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Highly Recommended for Keanu Reeves fans, Impressive Action
","'John Wick - Chapter 2' is an impressive action movie, both as a sequel and as a stand-alone movie. John (Keanu) continues his quest(and thirst) for revenge after being 're-ignited' by a don. The action in this movie is devilishly-lovable. Each action sequence has been creatively thought out and coordinated.One particular action scene is quite outstanding ; the scene in which Keanu has to battle with his former African friend. The martial arts style of fight in this scene is almost perfect. When their fight is interrupted by the hotel 'manager', the two end up having drinks together. Another scene worth mentioning is the one in which John (Keanu) orders his tailor-made suits, guns, shoes, and other accessories. It is a very sophisticated yet totally lovable type of scene.Once again, Keanu shines as the menacing, dangerous hit-man who is also known as 'The Boogey-Man'. I am looking forward to 'Chapter 3' of John Wick, because the ending of Chapter 2 was definitely incomplete.",8,4,7,9 November 2017
