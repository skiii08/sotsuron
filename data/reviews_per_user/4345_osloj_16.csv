E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Child-Like View of Dangerous Aliens
","This childish view of alien relations not only denounces science as the faith of mankind, but it makes the alien creature a martyr symbol, impervious to the inklings of failure that most men have to endure.  Almost as bad as the NBC sit-com drama 'ALF', which attempted to make fun of a furry stuffed rodent from some other planet.  If you find this repulsive, then may I suggest that the alien was probably carrying some type of disease with him and the director makes it seem like its a great thing to have a dirty creature from the Planet zero in your house.  All around boredom and yawn sequences are found throughout.  Only see this for the special effects which are worn and outdated.",Null,0,2,10 March 2004
The Italian Job," A Terrible Film
","This film, directed by some hack who directed MTV videos is a complete waste of time.  The small story to tell, which is obscurred by MTV style action sequences and product placements, is entirely absurd.  The actors are terrible and it was very boring.  I expected at least to be entertained by anyone wanting a decent film, get 'Bullit' with McQueen because it was better than this.....",1,9,22,8 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Worse Piece of Festering Dung Unleashed to Audiences
","It is clear that this film is very boring and it was done on a big budget amateurish basis, for what director would sacrifice plot in the name of 2 hours of eye gouging Orc killing? Did he have something against the Orcs, who stink of urine and rat nests, or did he just want to give us more moments of boredom?  I find there to be no redeeming values in this tasteless film which wants to simply reek in great amounts of money, win undeserving oscars and proclaim itself under the pretense of a great film, to be the best movie making experience.  A complete waste of time.....",Null,1,2,8 March 2004
American Psycho," Worthless Junk
","This film is boring from the start and I couldn't wait until the end when all my suspicions would be put to the test.  What I was expecting is at least an attempt to make an interesting picture.  This movie suffers from confusing direction and bad plot lines.  We don't know whether to take this movie at face value and think of it as satire (badly done) or a horror film (even worse).  Bale is terrible as a spoiled yuppie who has an urge to kill and have sex and wash his clean.  This doesn't even bring interest to a retarded person, I don't know what film the reviewers saw who gave it thumbs up, they must have been drunk.",Null,2,4,5 June 2002
Cross of Iron," War, Death and Men
","This is a wonderful film, I saw it when I was in my teens and it left a lasting impression on me, especially the wonderful performance by Coburn who was a fabulous actor. He is invaluable in this role and his face and presentation embodies Steiner completely. Steiner is the existentialist anti-hero, anti-authority and bearing the marks of a cynic, he nonetheless cares about the fate of his men in a war that is absurd. From stupid and vain superior officers, to petty infighting amongst one's own ranks, this film embodies war not as something heroic, but as something solitary and individual. . . . .",10,0,0,21 October 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Morally Weak Film Based on Flawed Sentimentality
","Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's continued descent into narrow, arrogant, low-brow revisionism, is at best a languid patriotic trump-calling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the 'glorious, morally superior American armed forces', who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat German prisoners and raped French women and looted European cities. He starts off with Kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of American malls, he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that Americans were all 'good guys'. This is not the case, history has shown us so. Americans, for all their good intentions in World War 2, were just as loathsome as the Nazis, they had a deep segregationist attitude in the States which killed people because of skin color, arrested and imprisoned innocent, hard working Japanese people and locked them in concentration camps, kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions, fire bombed non-tactical European cities, most notably Dresden, hired former Nazis to combat the 'communist threat' and finally, dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent Japanese civilian population. And after the war, things got even worse, the 'Red Hunt', which resembled the trials in Nazi Germany in the 1930's occurred under a madman named McCarthy. So if you want to be blindly led by Spielberg's glorious war message that is simply propaganda, then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities.It is truly amazing that people unaccustomed to great films should reveal this one to be the 'best wars film ever' as if no capable director had ever attempted to bring the horror and stupidity of war to the screen. Perhaps, instead of giving Spielberg the automatic credit of creating the war genre, they should go out and rent 'Come and See' (Russian), The Burmese Harp (1967), Fires on the Plain (1959) or Paths of Glory (1957), truly far superior films to this Hollywood-bastardization and candy treatment of war. There is absolutely no plot in this uneven film and the whole landing at D-Day, according to Spielberg, was in some way just a side show to saving 'Private Ryan'. With such a simplistic statement, it is easy to see why most reviewers revel in the sense that 'action, action, action' is equated with 'greatness'. I only guess that because they must be entertained that directors continue to keep punching out such opportunistic filth. While most viewers, who are safely tucked away in their houses, waving American flags and discharging a few tears, saying, 'You German scum! You German scum!' can truly appreciate blood and guts as 'cinema' then there is a market for it. After you get through the puerile premise, then you can sit back, have a few beers and watch heads explode in the carnage that has no intellectual meaning and is the most cliché-driven rubbish that has ever been produced. The scenes themselves are overdrawn, stolen from previous war films from the 1950's, namely the Longest Day (1962) which was a great film in itself. The beach landing is too long, and it shows only the Americans as 'heroic' while the Germans are seen as 'evil Hun scum'. Tom Hanks, in his most idiotic and candid self, seems out of place as a leader of a bunch of rejects that are entrusted to save Private Ryan and in one completely absurd scene, the remaining 15 Americans defeat a battle hardened, superiorly trained SS special unit group with just a few guns. Now, if you know anything about history, then you would know that the SS were not an 'easy group' to defeat, they were some of the most fanatical and well-trained soldiers of the German Reich but since Spielberg thinks we all are just a bunch of idiots, he'll continue to manufacture such inconsistent story lines. This is only a tear jerker movie and it does nothing else, I would suggest watching 'Hell Is for Heroes' (1962) with Steve McQueen, because it is a lot better and we don't have to be forced to carry an American flag at the end.",1,142,330,22 September 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Lord of the Boring Moments, Worst Film Ever Made
","I picked this up because frankly there was nothing else to rent at the local video place and I expected it to be bad but not as terrible as it was.  Most of the 'great' reviews on here were constructed by the crowd that has a low IQ, goes to malls and drinks 2 gallons of soda each day, suffice it to say, this is merely 'eye candy' to folks like that but when you analyze the actual picture, it is absolutely worthless garbage even on that level.  I sat through 4 hours of this junk simply to be amazed at how terrible it was. The plot is so thin and the dialogue so silly that one is amazed at how many people were hired on this picture.  Spending millions of dollars, on mostly awful animated sequences that aren't done very well, the director has given people expecting a story nothing but reason to critique him. In one scene the light is very bright and when the scene is cut to a part which is illustrated with computers, it becomes dark, such inconsistencies are obvious throughout.  The battle scenes are supposed to be funny because some of the 'heros' should have been killed long ago but they hack about 600 orcs.  Gosh, is this made for teens?  My grade: D.",4,1,6,8 March 2004
Schindler's List," Holocaust as Family Drama, Awful Junk
","This film is very empty, for not only does it portray the Germans as 'evil, lop-sided, devil worshippers' but it shows the Jews as being 'promising, alluring, good guys'.  If one is to question morality, then do so, but do not give us the black vs white issue found in this film.  Speilberg, immature since day one as director, tells us what to think, he strips away our humanity by overdosing us on excessive amounts of guilt and sentimentality.  In effect, the film lacks any moral basis except to denounce all evil men and with that, we learn absolutely nothing.....",1,289,590,10 March 2004
Life Is Beautiful," sentimental slop
","This 'sentimental slop', hardly registering any intelligence, is considered a 'masterpiece' and received numerous vapid awards, notably from powerful Jewish groups and pompous film festivals. It is both ineffective as a film and as a critique against clichéd injustice. I can't believe how empty it was, it starts out in a comedic manner, but it is absent of any laughs. The direction throughout was haphazard and even tedious. The 'evil' Germans were cardboard caricatures who were so clichéd that they didn't even seem to exhibit any movement in the film.Its obvious this film was some attempt to portray the magical realism of early Italian films with a pressing new concern for so-called 'ethics' but is biased, immature and intangible. It is another 'holocaust' as collective conscience film that wants to hammer its obtuse point across. Be weary of such films as they want to present everything in simplistic 'black and white' formulations.",1,16,37,9 January 2007
From Hell," From Hell Watching This Movie
","Depp is miscast as a shy, dim witted, idiot savant English detective in this 'Hollywoodization' of the Jack Ripper scenario.  He attempts to keep an English accent but doesn't realize he sounds nowhere near that tonality. The movie, for the most part, is quite boring and doesn't offer anything significant except loud music, gory MTV style editing and too many whores in the streets of London to look at.  What we have here is an experienced director (the Huges brothers) who do not even know where to begin in this mess.  Not recommended.",Null,1,2,7 August 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Pure Crap
","What more is there to say than this was utterly predictable and a complete waste of time?  It actually is amazing that so many people were involved with the film and such a large amount of money was spent on it, and all they did was steal from other movies and leave the viewer saying, 'That's it?' Avoid this garbage from here on out.",Null,0,0,24 November 2003
12 Years a Slave," black exploitation film
","This 'black exploitation film' lacks any real sense of narrative, instead it showcases a near-sardonic attempt at complete savagery. The film is highly racist against white people, as it attempts to capitalize on the 'brutal' scenes and endear the white audience as somehow responsible for slavery, which we of the present, are in no way culpable.It is ineffective as both a polemic and drama. Brad Pitt (one of the film's producers) appearing as a ridiculous, self righteous cartoon, lowers it even more into the territory of baseless sentimentalism.The director is working simply on hyperbolic elements, which make this film highly 'unreal'. No doubt he is merely using it as visual propaganda, for what cause, remains to be seen.I would not take such a film to be serious at all.",2,12,21,7 April 2015
Signs," Average to Below Average Taken from Cliched 50's Films.
","This film is one that has absolutely nothing to add to the sci-fi genre and most people have lauded it as the best thing since mustard.  This is a very average film that is boring and predictable and it is absurd in its entirety, not to mention that the director (who is incredulous in the film) can not handle the basic premise of logic. The inconsistent themes which play out are laughble, considering that a whole film is wasted on the pseudo-intellectualizing of a man who has lost his faith and regained it because of an alien invasion (was the script written by a 14 year old). Most of the film takes place on some small farm in Iowa that is attacked by plastic looking aliens which are latter computerized and hillarious. Avoid after first viewing. Grade: C.",4,2,3,3 March 2004
Gangs of New York," Incomprehensible Junk from a Hollywood Sellout
","This film pretends that it is historic, but it does not deal with history, at least not real history, what is portrayed in the film instead is amiable 'hollywood-ization' of a marginal topic. Scorsese makes the gang wars more brutal than they were, perhaps resembling some choreographed knife fight at the local dance hall. I find it incredulous to believe that 600 drunk Irish hooligans were at each other's throats near the lower East side, there is no recorded document of the event, oh, he made it up to please the masses. How fun is it when a man gets an axe in the head, well, according to the director, very fun indeed. It is sick, not only that he uses a serious issue of race violence in early American urban landscapes, but he makes it look cartoon-like. I found the film too long, predictably played by terrible actors in folly-like roles and the end is a complete disaster that no one can decipher. A below average piece of junk from a once mild director....",2,4,9,10 March 2004
Gladiator," Maximum Battles
","Although I wouldn't say this is a 'good' movie or even a 'classic' like the muddled brain dead teens who claim it is the best piece of cinema in the world, I would call it entertaining and nothing more.  The film was created to make money, not to stimulate our intellect and I understand that and in the end I said to myself, i could see this again, only for the ability of Crowe to convey to us the power of loss and imprisonment and especially for the stunning battles sequences that are exciting.  The plot is unbelievable, and the special effects even worse and even the editing is loose and discordant but again, Crowe's presence and the fights are terrific so don't go to the theater thinking this is Spartacus.",Null,0,0,15 August 2002
Cinderella Man," Ron Howard's 'opium inducing Hollywood'
","Ron Howard's apologia to the capitalists and greed merchants who bankrupted the economy of the world in the 1930's borders on sanctimonious state sanctioned propaganda, made by an inept puppeteer of emotions. Produced merely to make train loads of money and sold to meandering and lost U.S. audiences, who humbly crave a place in the world and a pain numbing drug (feel good cinema), ensnarled both by their love of sugar and savvy chic theater appeal, while their enthusiastic leaders wage war in foreign soils, this is the continued attempt of Hollywood to enter once again the politics of the 'I'.Using the theme of 'courageous moral values' (much like today's incompetent charismatic leaders), which time and time again is sequestered by those in power to move the humble masses into ideological behavior patterns, Howard crafts a narrow look into the life of a street bruiser, whose lack of foresight and intelligence, makes him both gullible and 'proud', a trait possessed by most of the lower class, to their detriment.Absolutely devoid of any human interest or articulation, this film is pure rubbish, created by an 'opium inducing Hollywood' to forget that 'times are hard' and that by the lie which they force feed to the masses, 'sheer determination and hard work', they'll all be better. Well, that is hardly reality, and neither is this film, it borders on liquid loads of sentimentality, showing starving families and kids who crave a better life, hungering for the 'American dream' just around the block, which itself is a fictitious and disastrous lie. Instead of properly showing the man as he is, an exploited and misguided boxer without an IQ or class consciousness, subjugated day one from indoctrination in an industrial-capitalist world, a mere casualty of an oppressed class, Howard surges him to the role of a saint for the poor and downtrodden. He pays off his 'welfare' because he's so ashamed to be on it, he gives apples to blind kids and he kisses his wife at night, oh what loyalty to authority! Well, inject sugar into my veins, I can overcome my own poverty if I merely get into a ring to have my brains splattered by greedy ring promoters and homicidal boxers. This childish disposition to which Howard indulges us to drink, is nothing but empty and stale air. Howard makes Braddock into a wooden man, invulnerable at all to our own failings, and therefore, inhuman, without fault.Cartoon-like episodes are neither vivid nor distinct, and by the end of this film, we feel like we have watched another worthless re-packaging of the same indeposable values that the U.S. seems to reap upon the unaware, blind, obedient masses. Instead of actually reading important books, a trait which is entirely forgotten by U.S. audiences, they want 'feel good portions' heaped upon them.This film drips with the adoration of petty values espoused by the elite classes while they themselves eat well and are mired in their own hypocrisy. Please, some audience members are not stupid, but most are, and they will praise this unworthy film, along with others, as the splendid creation of an artist touched by his evocation of the past which he has created.",1,12,29,5 June 2006
