3:10 to Yuma," The best western ever.
",What a wonderful film and a great western. The direction was magnificent as well as all of the acting. The screenplay contained so many twists and turns that I will have to see it again to make sure what I saw was correct. You must see this movie for yourself. If someone merely told you the story you would not believe them. Russell Crowe and Christian Bales went beyond their normal good acting to move into an even higher category. All of the supporting actors were right on task in each scene. The exterior scenes shot in New Mexico were spectacular and were on the same par as John Ford films of the past. I am sure that the Academy will recognize this film as one of the best of the year.,10,1,6,14 September 2007
