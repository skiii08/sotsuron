Alien 3," Watch the version with the DOG, not the one with the OX. You'll love it !!! It's ... not the same movie, people !
","Dear God, I recently re-saw Alien 3, but the movie I got was not the one I wanted. apparently, the version I had been used to was the THEATRICAL version, the one with the dog. the one I saw just now, was the one with the ox, which they said was re-mastered. i must say, although it was longer and somehow more explaining, I was disappointed, and I have to say: Stop re-releasing these movies, and just stick to the original version. David Fincher is one of my favorite directors of all time. he gave us SEVEN, THE GAME, FIGHT CLUB, PANIC ROOM, ZODIAC which are all very good movies, and Alien 3 is among them, with no exception. The reason people despise this movie is because they have all seen the other version, the one with the ox, which is a totally different movie. it's longer, more boring, and the entire idea gets lost along the way, diffused in the mumbo-jumbo of what they thought might be a good idea. Sigourney Weaver is great, as usual in this role, also great performances by some British actors such as Charles Dance and Danny Webb. great movie. the series goes on (at least until Resurrection, because AVP sucked big time).",8,1,59,17 November 2008
Se7en," Shivers down the spine ...
","I've seen this movie at least ten times, and every time it's getting better then the last time. I have been paying much attention to the script, in order to find some mistakes, because I couldn't believe that such a script was viable. But it is. Andrew Walker is a genius, a fact proved by Seven and consolidated by 8MM. Never mind the acting. Freeman, Pitt, Paltrow and Spacey are multiple Oscar winners and nominees, so we're not talking about them. It goes without saying. As for David Fincher, the movie is obviously his masterpiece (along with Fight Club, of course). The movie is ... just mind blowing. The atmosphere is raw, and unstudied, and it all happens very fast, flowing towards the ending. And as John Doe grins at the end, knowing that he TRULY is the victor, the tension rises every time, and the musical score just makes you breathe on the edge of the seat, that's when the truth is revealed ... to be one of the greatest movies ever made. You shouldn't try to watch it. You HAVE TO watch it. Otherwise you've lived for nothing.",9,0,0,28 January 2010
