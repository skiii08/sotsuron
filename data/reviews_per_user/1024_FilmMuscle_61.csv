The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Plot Thickens, Or Does It?
","Just when we thought we had a new complex and interesting female character—a true heroine—this latest entry shows her spending half (or even more) of the time talking about and crying over boys. Her motivations become so muddled by yet another generic YA love triangle (screaming over Peeta and listlessly kissing Gale). This all certainly isn't helped by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence seemingly just doesn't understand the acting technique of subtlety. Her highly hysterical/overreacting character leaves much to be desired in regards to actual nuance—a case that would allow the viewers to look into her eyes and judge for themselves. Lawrence's sheer overacting has dominated most of her work since the Oscar win (actually, including Silver Linings Playbook as well) with this manner becoming even more noticeably cringe-worthy with Mockingjay Part 1. Her loud- mouthed/attention-provoking, apparently 'real' persona has won many people over and her way of forcing her 'acting' in audiences' faces (weeping, yelling, or generally acting in aggression in almost every other scene) makes it unsurprising as to why she's still in the public's favor.As for the narrative, the stakes always appear so heightened and forcibly gloom, but the resolutions are always so perfect to the point where it's difficult to seriously believe in the peril of the story's characters. In this addition, Katniss Everdeen has fully assumed the 'Mockingjay' symbol—a public leader for the final revolution against the Capitol. More and more of the district's citizens have become aware of the atrocities committed by its government and the vileness of the Hunger Games. It's time to courageously fight back! Each one of these films possess very obvious—perhaps, even heavy-handed—analogies to the contemporary climate and the world's current circumstances when it comes to 'radical' revolutionaries, government control/failure of democracy, media influence, etc. Considering that the series' premise centers on people who're forced to kill each other in order to survive, our primary characters always end up fine by the conclusion. 'Is he dead?' 'Did they die?' No, not for a minute am I convinced that anyone is on the brink of death. Maybe they'll make the drama and danger genuine in the finale next year, maybe not. Then again, it's the same annoying issue every expensive blockbuster suffers from these days, especially the Marvel films. (Yes, I know this is a film adaptation of a book series that's following an already-created narrative; it still doesn't change anything about the tale's quality or the right to criticize it.) On the other hand, this time around, we thankfully don't have to deal with the utterly predictable and tedious hunger game sections. Part 1 of this two-part climax reminds me of the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in that it focuses more on the set-up and grounded drama rather than the explosive ultimate battles, meaning that I'll likely prefer this one to next year's (yes, I much preferred the first part of Harry Potter's finale to the last half).Moreover, the stunning visuals/cinematography really does improve with every installment. The look of these films always seem to darken and grow starker with every new entry; the style of the franchise is very much its distinctive own. As a matter of fact, the exceptional sound mixing and grand production design drastically help distinguish this franchise from the innumerable cheap YA rip-offs that came after its success. Nonetheless, the overall cast, filled with bland pretty boys and unremarkable veteran performances, makes the entire film (which, keep in mind, is considerably shorter than its predecessors) feel like somewhat of a bore to get through. The objectives for the characters are set into motion fairly quickly, but most of the film is wasted on needless dialogue and repetitious scenes ('I love Peeta,' and then, 'we have to rescue Peeta!' about a dozen times throughout). It only makes it that much more obvious that the studio simply separated the films to blatantly cash in on the property—the newest irritating trend in the industry.",4,50,84,21 November 2014
The Monuments Men," Not Quite So Monumental
","As if you didn't have enough ammunition to despise Adolf Hitler, The Monuments Men exposes the Nazis' additional goals to eradicate the precious artworks of the world, essentially erasing the history and legacies of many. In this fictionalized recount, Frank Stokes (played by George Clooney) assembles an inexperienced crew of cohorts to take back these most prized paintings, sculptures, and whatnot from the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. What basically teases a remarkable cast- comprising your favorite actors/comedians- only reveals itself to be a broken promise. What it is is the year's first major disappointment since I could honestly find very few redeeming qualities in its content, if any at all. Most of the cast (from the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett, and more) are just playing themselves, and even then, a lot of them are severely underrepresented and aren't given the proper amount of time to shine. Specifically, I have no idea who chose to cast Cate Blanchett as a Frenchwoman- wildly unconvincing, especially considering her inconsistent accent. This might feel somewhat like a digression, but I am immensely irritated by Hollywood's overt reliance on either British or American actors. Was it too difficult to find a French actress to play that role? We've got Marion Cotillard, Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy, Bérénice Bejo- case in point: an abundance of highly talented French actresses you could've effortlessly fit into that role, but nope, apparently, Hollywood requires for every other European nationality- from Russians to the French- to be portrayed by British or American actors because they're 'Oscar winners and they can probably play anything,' right? Anyways, back to the film itself, we could've easily had a plethora of memorable interactions, comedic or dramatic, but too much time is wasted on flat jokes and unnecessary, insipid dialogue- too much dwelling on the characters' personal lives and pasts that unfortunately adds nothing to their complexity (there is none). Most importantly, the film loses quite a bit of intrigue and appeal with every passing minute; it's definitely not as engaging and entertaining as it had the potential to be. Simply put, it's terribly dragged out and the ending is fairly anti-climactic. A considerable portion of the film is largely uneventful. I mean, what are they even exactly doing for the first hour and a half? During this catastrophic and traumatizing period, the characters have an amusing time walking around and chatting, but there's absolutely no hint of progress until the very last quarter of the narrative. It's a whole lot of exposition that leads to an embarrassingly unsatisfying climax. As I was saying, the picture is pervaded by humor but to an excessive and unrestrained extent, which only lends itself to failure since the majority of the jokes fall flat (a few effectively deliver, and even those are eventually played out). There were a few scenes that finally unraveled with the right emotional or thematic impact, but those were very, very few and far between. The premise had my attention but again the movie slaughtered its potential even if it put in some effort. All in all, The Monuments Men was George Clooney's first directorial (transparent) dud that's acutely forgettable and surprisingly void of any entertainment. I would've much rather settled for a documentary to delineate this fascinating historical event.",Null,1,3,15 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips Drowns in its Pace
","Paul Greengrass is the creator of one of the most exhilarating and outright brilliant action trilogies out there (The Bourne Trilogy), and now, he has taken the helm behind a production, centering on a shocking true story in which an American cargo ship was captured by Somali pirates in 2009. I'll reveal nothing more because the whole thrill is not having any knowledge of what lies ahead. Now, I'll be real straightforward this time around, and it really pains me to say this, but I just was really disappointed with the film altogether. Yes, I'll give the film its props for the splendid technical aspect of it all, and I guess I'll delve into that area first before I proceed with a more negative tone. As usual, Greengrass's filmmaking techniques are in a league of their own as he prefers to cut the theatrical and cinematic appearance to a minimum and immerse us in a perilous setting by engaging in fast-paced, fairly shaky camera-work. Some might complain about this method, but I find it excellently unique and applaud him on that note because it essentially is what keeps the film so tense. Vividly displaying shots of various sceneries and movements, coupled with intense music, strongly contribute to the picture's finest moments. In addition, you have the quick-cut, frenetic editing- again, at the top of its game. Greengrass has basically perfected all of these elements already in his past projects, so it's no surprise that Captain Phillips fully delivers in that department this time around as well. The production, overall, is a very wild one since the director famously casts real individuals (in whatever job positions he desires to implement into the story). You'll see actual navy officers and army nurses throughout the story, and unlike previous movies with such gimmicks, these people feel utterly convincing in their roles. Then, there's Tom Hanks whom everyone knows and loves. He's definitely one of the greatest actors of our time, and his incredibly impressive resume unquestionably backs that claim up. Tom Hanks takes on the role of the captain (Captain Phillips!), hoping to lead this cargo ship to its destination until it unfortunately encounters terribly aggressive conflict. In the last ten minute alone, there's no doubt in my mind when I say that he absolutely delivers one of the best male performances of the year, and I'm excited to see him receive a lot of credit once everything is said and done this year. On top of that, we have the Somali pirates with their own captain, Muse(played by Barkhad Abdi), who also provides us with an exceptional performance, which I'm definitely not going to forget once I start considering the best supporting actor of this year. There's that abundance of menace and unpredictability in his eyes the entire time, but at the same time, we feel some form of pity and sadness towards him due to these circumstances and background that force him into this predicament and pit him against the best of the best. Judging from the trailers, you feel this unimaginable detest towards the villains already, right? But seeing the film- for those who consider philosophical theories like Cultural Relativism- you suddenly and unexpectedly find yourself slightly sympathizing with some of these generally despicable and horrendous human beings (if you can call them that), but then again, you'll always be rooting for Tom Hanks' character and all those aboard the MV Maersk Alabama. The villains' objectives and determined actions, however, bring up a decently relevant point: if people have the opportunity, they'll always want more and more money in the end- that greed that unfortunately has consumed most of mankind. With that being said, all the actors involved for that matter, no matter how small their screen time, succeed in building the intensity and believability of the disastrous situation. The soundtrack, itself, is another excellent attachment, fueling the pumping suspense with that Bourne-like flavor. Whenever you want one of your scenes to completely pack a large punch, the easiest way to do so is include thunderous and beating music, which is what ultimately compliments the film's shining sequences. Aside from that though , there are certain flaws of Captain Phillips that really detracted from the experience and left a bad taste in my mouth- actually a taste that truly saddened me in that I wished I would've enjoyed the film so much more like many apparently did. All in all, the feature doubtlessly suffers from pacing issues. Honestly, I can't understand how such a great amount of people found films like Gravity and Captain Phillips tense. Yes, there were particular segments that felt remarkably tense, but contrary to popular opinion, the film did not keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time, but I guess I must have ADD problems, right? Because I found myself zoning out plenty of times, and that's clearly not good in the slightest. The film didn't capture my attention the way some of my favorites this fall season have: Rush and Don Jon, specifically. I know, I know. Some will blast me for preferring those two over Captain Phillips, but I stand by my statement; the film feels dragged out, and it's simple as that- the latter half especially. And in it being stretched out is the reason why I felt it wasn't nearly as tense as many considered it to be (my bad). Some films (over 2-3 hours) pass by like no tomorrow, but this one's length certainly seemed obvious. There were some minor issues I had with the film such as the presence of some scenes being a little exaggerated in their dramatic delivery (an overly, exhausting amount of screaming and yelling) for the fullest Hollywood effect, but it's the undeniably noticeable pacing that remains the greatest trouble for the film and what sadly restrains Captain Phillips from the potential heights it could've reached when I announce my own picks and movie awards.",7,4,15,13 October 2013
The Equalizer," More Than Just Another Denzel Washington Action Movie?
","Antonie Fuqua, director of Training Day, has created another harsh and energetic vehicle for his star, Denzel Washington—another determined warrior who's out for no-holds-barred vengeance. The Equalizer, for that matter, has a lot of style—there's no doubt about that. Its cinematography is genuinely impressive, permeated by shots of glistening skyscrapers, luxury cars, and heavily stylized, slo-mo portionsbut it's ultimately all too familiar. The Russians, of course, represent the one-dimensional villains here who merely function as tools to showcase Washington's wild skill set. The tone of the film is certainly its strongest suit—very gritty and dark in a glossy cosmopolitan setting that's oftentimes seen at night. There are plenty of painful deaths and an abundance of blood to be seen. Other than that, the plot gets rather ridiculous very fast. In fact, we discover soon that its wonderful tone actually isn't very fitting for the content of the movie. A world that's initially established with realism, beginning to introduce compelling themes and displaying how Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) strives to be a better man—strict exercise and diet regimens, relaxed dinners with classic literary works placed right by his plate, and an optimistic philosophy with which he helps improve his friends and colleagues as well. We quickly learn that he's clearly a man of dignity, integrity, and self-respect; quite the compelling start into the first twenty minutes. The narrative first fleshes out the tedious routines of his every day until we run into Chloe Moretz's character, Teri. Though she's given disappointingly little screen time, Moretz, as usual, shines with every minute she's given—a deeply vulnerable adolescent whose innocence glimmers from her eyes, slowly and tragically vanishing while she's raised in a strongly depraved environment as a hooker for the Russian mafia. She doesn't see through the same hopeful eyes that Robert does, and there we see two completely irreconcilable worlds encounter one another—that of the ponderously cynical and that of the buoyant or even, shall I say, naïve. Can we truly change the environment in which we have already developed ourselves? Just how plausible is this seemingly mythical betterment of self? These are some of several philosophical concepts and quiet moments of character introspection and reflection as the austere streets of Boston (somewhat resembling the ambiance of 2007's Gone Baby Gone) outside their windows go on by. Well, all of that potential is quickly squandered as The Equalizer jarringly metamorphoses into a blatant, clichéd action flick that becomes less and less remarkable as it progresses. With his gimmicky watch-setting and slow-motion maneuvering around any given predicament, you suspect that McCall might just be another unstoppable superhero after all. Whereas Man on Fire (a film that can easily be compared to this one) mixes emotion with a hell-bent Denzel—hunting down the kidnappers one-by-one with realistically brutal methods—this movie, on the other hand, becomes incredibly outlandish when the protagonist begins effortlessly killing dozens of baddies in one confined arena, magically having enough time to implement creativity into each take- down as well. And, you know, Washington plays a character he has portrayed many times before: deadly serious and tough as nails in his manner of speech and physicality. In addition, its runtime of 2 hours and 11 minutes doesn't grant it any favors either. The final (explosive) sequence runs on for far too long and feels like it took up almost a quarter of the film. In the movie's first action segments, the grisly violence is undoubtedly shocking, as well as exciting. By the end, it becomes monotonous and unspectacular. The violence is by then cleverly shadowed as to dramatically reduce its severity; I guess it's the implied ways by how they're executed that occasionally provoke the squirms from the audience. But even after that prolonged final confrontation, the film unnecessarily continues with multiple additional scenes as Washington (somehow) masterfully climbs even farther up the mafia ladder with fueling revenge. The impeccably stimulating score by the ever-talented Harry Gregson- Williams screams with the same tragic emotion and melancholy that Man on Fire did but never effectively translates that onto the screen. If only there was creativity applied to its insipid story and a more grounded approach (complementing the grittiness of its tone), The Equalizer could've made for a memorable action film. At the end of the day though, audiences will likely remember it as just another Denzel Washington action movie among many.",5,2,6,29 September 2014
John Wick," Yeah, I'm Thinking Keanu Reeves Is Back!
","American cinema has been continually producing very bland and forgettable action movies (The Equalizer serves as a recent example— does anyone even remember that movie?). This year's earlier martial arts showcase, The Raid 2, easily beats out everything else from the genre's crop, and that is especially including the Marvel/superhero movies that are more about spectacular set pieces than innovative, fascinating action choreography. Well, maybe the American Kung-Fu fan/renowned action star is the best chance we have at an effective American action film at this point. 'People keep asking if I'm back; yeah, I'm thinking I'm back!' Keanu Reeves returns to staple badassery as John Wick who has recently lost his wife to cancer. After the painful funeral, he unexpectedly receives a delivery package at his door—a final gift from his wife in order to help ease his grief: a cute, little dog. Of course, trouble never ceases to find Wick and after unintentionally pissing off a group of Russian mobsters at a gas station, they give him an unpleasant visit where he witnesses the murder of his dog and suffers a brutal beating. Oh, it's on! Little do those guys know who they're messing with—a bogeyman who has even spooked the mob boss into beating some sense into his culprit son and letting him know what exactly he has done. John Wick—with his deadly skills teased and his true background mysterious— readies his weapons, and pure ruthless revenge ensues from there on out. The movie accomplishes just what American action cinema fails at every time. The action sequences are filmed with the use of astonishing cinematography—plenty of wide shots to perfectly display everything that transpires on-screen without confusing the audience. The camera invariably gives us a good layout of the particular environment, which is followed by John Wick's clever utilization of those surroundings to break bones and rupture skulls. In fact, the film is so embellished with glitzy style that even its subtitles come all vibrantly colored with a catchy font and ingenious screen placement. The majority of the film is set at nighttime, and thus, we get that metropolitan vibe along with a dusky color palette—an alluring greenish/bluish hue. In addition, a groovy, cool soundtrack incessantly complements the impressive action sequences; the best segment taking place in a violet-lit, intensely-staged night club as guns blaze and dubstep drowns out the screams. And despite Keanu Reeve's transparently limited acting range, this tough-as-nails role certainly plays to his strengths with the intimidating monotone one-liner delivery and that never-ending, rigid look of sheer ire. Unlike The Raid 2 however, there's no compelling narrative to give the film's duration any necessity to continue. John Wick simply comprises one action scene after another. Unfortunately, the combat gets repetitive fairly quickly—repeating wrestling techniques (choke holds, etc.) and blowing brains out with the same up-close strategy—and it honestly feels like the plot struggles with where to proceed next. 'Oh, I need to kill this guy, and now I have to kill this other guy in another location.' The story essentially follows this formula and hopes that the viewers find that adequate enough for non-stop entertainment. An hour in though, it clearly begins to drag and doesn't show any sort of storytelling restraint in terms of when enough is enough, which is the same issue The Equalizer shared. If this high-octane extravaganza was only slimmed down by thirty minutes, it would've made for a far more satisfying and memorable experience, but I just can't say that John Wick even compares to the consistent mastery The Raid 2 boasted. This one has its fair share of cheesy, awkward moments (albeit with intention) but also just overall shallowness. With that being said, beholding the first hour alone makes it worth seeing over every American action movie this year (I still don't know if that says a lot about the staleness of the genre nowadays, or if I should just accept that John Wick surely possesses stunning quality?).",6,4,20,26 October 2014
Gravity," The Definition of Spectacular Filmmaking
","What really makes a film great? In my mind, a film has to have some form of complexity whether it's through its plot/story or through its thematic material. At first glance, Gravity might seem like a simple action movie set in space, but once you notice Alfonso Cuaron's name in the credits, you suddenly understand that there's definitely more there than meets the eye, and that's exactly how it turned out to be. To analyze Gravity to the fullest extent would take numerous pages, which means my review would eventually outstay its welcome. Anyways, moving on, all you need to know prior to entering the darkened theater is that the film stars two of America's sweethearts (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney) and that it'll take you on an unforgettable and exhilarating ride. I don't need to cover the premise in four or five paragraphs like some people; frankly, it annoys me. But I just have to dedicate a fair share of time to address the level of immersion this film provides. Again, it's one of the most immersive experiences you'll ever encounter as you really feel like you're in outer space, and I'm not exaggerating; I highly recommend all of you to go see it in IMAX 3D immediately before it's too late because that's basically the perfect format for a film of this caliber. It was meant to be experienced in IMAX 3D, and I can't say that for a lot of films, but by god, just do it. The sound design is unbelievably impressive. The filmmakers were somehow able to replicate the right vibrations and volume (considering distance and enclosure), and once that camera enters the astronaut's suit, you undoubtedly and unexpectedly feel the character's pulse and their every movement, required to deal with that encumbering outfit. And when you hear a thundering boom or the commencement of the film's phenomenal soundtrack, you'll probably then realize just how surreal and larger-than-life of a picture you're truly witnessing. The music itself implements so much energy into the feature where at times, it absolutely causes goosebumps or sends chills down your spine, and given the booming and grand surround sound in the IMAX 3D room, you will be left in awe and forced to the edge of your seat. Overall, it's chilling and terrifying at times and then impactful and resounding elsewhere. On another and arguably more important note, you have the spectacular cinematography and visuals, which honestly serve as the highest draws and strengths of Gravity. The amount of work and the power of the technology put into this production is simply astounding, and as the audience views this unprecedented exhibition of multiplex filmmaking, they can't help but wonder how in the world this unforeseen feat was pulled off. How were the filmmakers capable of convincingly casting us into space, (seemingly) accurately capturing its frightening and remote ambiance? One might ruin the magic by insultingly responding with a 'they used a green screen,' but there's so much more to it than floating in front of a green screen. I can only imagine the effort put into the editing process, which had to perfectly sync every little detail and sound to the impeccable camera-work. Let me tell you: Alfonso Cuaron wowed the world back in 2006 with the work that was Children of Men in how it completely redefined the idea of lengthy shots. Relating back to Gravity, the first shot you see of the film (its opening in other words) lasts for about fifteen to twenty minutes- fifteen to twenty minutes! For that duration of time, the camera keeps on rolling, and in doing so, it moves from one focused object to another or character while countless events are occurring. How many takes did it take (oops, nothing I can do) to finally attain the perfect shot? Who knows but it's mind-boggling to even think about. The actors, the props, the cinematographer, the entire sound department- everyone! - were unquestionably under a lot of pressure while this technologically striking, visually beautiful, elaborated shot(s) continued. The picture only continued with this style as the rest still mostly consists of lengthy shots. Unfortunately, even though the critics have loved raving about it on a constant basis over the last week, it's not a perfect film. I've read some reviews after my viewing, and I've noticed just how much exaggeration these critics have been incorporating into their opinions. Noticeably, I can tell why. There's been an abundance of hype and praise surrounding this picture, and no one wants to be the outlier; thus, they begin stretching the actual depth and thematic material of the film quite a bit. In reality, you can do this with almost any film in existence, but there comes a point when your reader can easily point out where you specifically start entering the field of bulls***. Truthfully, the film occasionally feels like it's moving at a slow pace. For some odd reason, most of the critics out there seem to be applauding its lightning pace, but that's certainly not the case. You could tell there were moments that calmed and slowed down, and as much as the film advertises you being on the edge of your seat the entire time, that's not how it really plays out. And, of course, the passionate fans will come out and pan someone for possessing attention span issues, but you can approach any film's haters with such an excuse/attack. Let's attack people for having attention span deficits when they complain about the Tree of Life's snail-like pace, but that's a discussion for another day.To read further, check out http://www.movie-blogger.com/movie- review/definition-spectacular-filmmaking.

Fury," War Has Never Looked This Uneasy and Horrific!
","In David Ayer's Fury, you will not find the Malick-like romanticism of war or vague, beautifully symbolic shots of war's ravage. No, Fury seeks to paint as ugly of a literal portrait of war as possible with this latest WW2 film. Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov's remorseless navigation through innumerable mutilated, flattened corpses and exploding heads, as well as the total distressing destruction on display, makes the viewer feel all kinds of unpleasantness, especially in view of the purely morose and gritty color palette. Steven Price's effectively mournful score never ceases its emotional impact as viewers squirm and helplessly witness never-ending death and repugnant human behavior. After narrowly surviving a vicious battle against the superior German tanks and being left out to dry among countless American dead bodies, weary and downcast Don Collier (Brad Pitt) and his brutish crew are handed a young, inexperienced, and sensitive kid, Norman (Logan Lerman), who's just another one of the draft's victims—required to quickly transition from a relatively calming desk job to a mercilessly exhaustive position on the battlefield that forcefully strips all of your morals away. 'I can't do it!' Norman finally yells after being slapped around and taunted in the face of having to shoot a Nazi, otherwise a father with two kids and a loving wife. The amount of horrific, gory sights and the expectation to kill and kill some more is even greater than unbearable for this innocent man as he vomits and weeps, knowing full well he's a changing man. He will never return to the normal, comforting world he thought he knew. Paralleling the fierce war the story guides us through, we see Norman's gradual desensitization at the hands of unforgiving crew members: a pensive, pious man of God (Shia LaBeouf); the obnoxious, hostile big guy (Jon Bernthal); and the humorous one who goes on tirades in Spanish every now and then (Michael Peña). A soldier's virtue here is to act solely as a killing machine and end the day with the duty accomplished; tear through the meat and only leave the Germans' bones to rot behind. The violence we see on-screen is brutally realistic and disheartening in its portrayal—sometimes less theatrical than expected and sometimes just incredibly graphic. Whether it's a body crushed under tank treads or a man's left leg blown right off by a machine gun, the audience is in for an excruciatingly difficult glimpse into grueling and revengeful warfare. David Ayer brings his unvarnished style to the war genre; after exhibiting the raw ferocity of police work, his next focus is on an even more perilous task with a larger scope: combat itself—the largest war of all time. The aspect I was most torn on though was Logan Lerman's whole character arc. The runtime of this picture wasn't nearly adequate enough to convincingly show a fulfilling evolution of his character, ending up more rushed and artificial than anything. It takes a matter of scenes for him to suddenly foul his mouth and dramatically increase that pulse for ruthless killing. It's like that good kid in school who makes friends with and starts hanging around the naughty ones as he quickly (superficially) starts acting like he's one of them even though everyone around can tell the personality doesn't quite suit the kid yet. I wouldn't go so far as to blame Lerman's performance itself, but more so place that blame on the way his character was written and utilized. The first half of the plot features a heartbreaking, gut- wrenching look at his jarring introduction to combat, providing most of the compelling thematic material of the movie. That angle is unfortunately abandoned about an hour into the movie. All in all, the film carries neither the thematic complexity nor the narrative memorability some of the best war movies benefit from. The story is also not daring enough to depict the familial/civilian atrocities that transpired during the time as well—the abuse—as none of the American soldiers seem to cross the moral boundary to deranged extremes. The characters have hints of moral grayness to them but not enough to detract from its apparent glorification of the 'Oorah!' comradeship that forms under war, and this is where the film's agenda becomes somewhat mixed. Is it blatantly anti-war or more sentimental and simply patriotic in its messages like Lone Survivor or Saving Private Ryan? With that being said, Fury still manages to remain compelling and technically impressive throughout. We get several tense tank showdowns, entertaining character interactions between these loud personalities, and a real poignant climax.",7,1,8,19 October 2014
World War Z," World War Z is an entertaining, fun night out but not original in the slightest
","Finally, after years of facing difficulty with production and resources, World War Z has come our way, and it promises an epic and grandeur scale. The film definitely contains most of the elements fans have always desired in a zombie movie; it actually mixes horror, suspense, and action all in one movie. One act transpires underneath the roofs of a daunting apartment building when another act takes the audience across the world to Israel where the people left are forced to defend themselves against a monstrously colossal horde of zombies as they pile in. There are jump-scares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths. Anyways, the film focuses on Brad Pitt's character (Gerry Lane) who's required to assist the UN with discovering a possible vaccine/cure to the horrifying virus that's spreading throughout the world and turning human beings into ghastly creatures. If he refuses to comply, they'll willingly kick his entire family off a tanker- one of the few safe locations left in the world. From there on, Gerry Lane is forced to transcend country after country in order to secure his family's safety and possibly save humanity. A hell of a lot is at stake, that's for sure. Now, I can definitely state that one of the best aspects of the film is its acting, especially Brad Pitt's, which, as usual, doesn't disappoint. One can clearly witness the fear and terror present in almost every character's eyes, as well as one specific character quite convincingly pulling off the feeling of sheer pain under horrendous circumstances. With that being said, the very beginning of the film starts off a little bizarrely as the pace seems to suffer. With the running time that the movie possesses, such a rich and complex story is compacted to fit its duration, which means right off the bat, we're met with the apocalypse and the zombie outbreak. We only receive a few minutes, if that, of the main family's daily lives until they're cast into the conflict almost instantly. As a result, conversations feel extremely and oddly brief and segments that could've been expanded on feel like they're set on 'fast forward' in order to get to the 'point.' This means that there's much less space for character development and characterization in general, and zombie movies (or we can say Horror movies as a whole) definitely need to spend some time on their characters so that the audience is able to connect with them and feel for them as they progress on their journey. When they feel fear, we have to feel fear for them as well. Unfortunately, as this is largely a Hollywood blockbuster and not something like 28 Weeks Later, the film has to reach the action-packed bits as soon as possible. And this is when the film will cause a fair amount of decisiveness- the audience who read the book will approach the film differently than the ones who've seen the trailers and are just simply interested in the plot that's promised. I've read up on reviews, and most of the negative reviews originate from the individuals who expected an honest- shall I say- adaptation of the book (this is exactly the issue that faced The Great Gatsby or any other adaptation for that matter). I haven't read the book, which means I don't need to furiously rant about the film's disconnection from its novelistic counterpart. If you haven't read the book, you have no reason to worry about potential disappointment; that's practically reserved for the book's fans. If you're a book fan, on the other hand, you should be expecting the two's differentiation from one another. So, to put it most understandably, if you're entering this movie the way it was marketed, you'll experience a wild, roller-coaster ride that's fairly effective in its capability of featuring some dramatic moments of diplomatic negotiations and political discussions over the world's collapse and then placing you into intensely impossible situations only to be followed by an incredibly suspenseful, nerve-wracking sequence. It's highly entertaininghowever, it's the furthest from originality a film can get. I mean, it's yet another zombie movie, dealing with the entire world under a deadly zombie virus. You've basically seen everything in this movie already as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later highlighted the serious effects of such an event already. In that case- during its first act- World War Z feels unbelievably similar to the two films mentioned above. Especially considering the decision to exclude the more political aspect of the novel and turning the adaptation into an action flick instead, there's not much here that'll bask in uniqueness, really. This all begs the question: how much longer will these numerous entertainment industries create zombie stories after zombie stories? It's time to move on to another fascinating idea. Leave the genre alone, but then again, as long as these studios continue to rake in millions, they'll continually produce the same product. In the end, World War Z is a fun, entertaining night out, but if you can't make it to the showing, don't feel too bad because you've most likely seen everything displayed in this film already.",7,81,149,27 June 2013
About Time," About Time for These Kind of Rom-Com's!
","Normally, I'd be quite hesitant to seeing a rom-com, but as any open- minded individual, the concept and charm granted the film potential based on the promotions and instantly intrigued me. About Time revolves around a socially awkward character, Tim, who discovers an incredibly useful and all-the-more manipulative secret that runs on the male side of his family. A father essentially entrusts his son with this valuable power that allows him to travel back into his past, which means the next time Tim ruins a relationship or mistakenly goes for a kiss only to be humiliated thereafter, it's right to the nearest closet or compact room to fix the issue and reverse his horrible decisions. Moreover, the film happened to surprise me in that it carried much more heart and depth than your standard romantic comedy, and it rather flourishes in its style of authenticity. Progressively, we're either met with extremely relatable or wholly plausible situations that induce laughter or provoke various emotions deep inside that tough personality of yours (speaking from a male's perspective). Its strongly apparent sense of genuineness emphasizes the likability of the characters with Bill Nighy being a clear favorite, retaining that charisma and lovability that all have already come to associate him with. Domhnall Gleeson undeniably delivers a terrific performance, suffused by numerous subtle facial expressions, gestures, and stuttered speech that effectively composes his insecure nature. Furthermore, even though the final message of the film could be deemed cheesy, it's totally executed in a convincing manner in part by- again- its sincere essence. By the time the feature has wrapped up, the audience will be in tears. During its development, they'll be infatuated by its subject matter. In such fashion, About Time is remarkably capable of taking you on a wavy journey that consists of sadness at times and pure excitement or comedy in others. A wide variety of people will be sighted throughout its span, some veritably abhorrent and others utterly sympathetic, and it's this distinctiveness that comprises a realistic picture- something that's absolutely necessitated in a movie that deals with the kind of themes prevalent here. With that being said, the flick's length certainly becomes problematic as it nears the conclusion; its last thirty minutes or so noticeably drag out, and we encounter an unexpected scene after another. Just when we believe that we're witnessing the last point for its thematic material, we shift to a fresh setting and an additional quandary. Actually, it reminds me of Return of the King's last act which seems to present us with multiple extra scenes following several lengthy black screens. When the picture eventually finishes at the mark it sought to, it feels as if the whole matter could've been wrapped up in a more concise method without dozens of further complications as a means of elucidation. In sum, the idea of time travel is adeptly utilized in addition to the countless laughs to be had and the highly entertaining plot overall. About Time is undoubtedly one of the best rom-com's in recent years, and I hope to see more of this kind from Hollywood instead of the artificial half-assed stories, infested with detestable and debauched characters, they produce nowadays.",7,5,9,13 November 2013
Don Jon," Is It Better Than Porn?
","It seems like the most popular thing to do these days for actors is to make their own directorial debuts. It's never been such a trend until now (probably) when actors saw that Ben Affleck has garnered quite a bit of success as a filmmaker. Everyone from James Franco to Cate Blanchett to Ryan Gosling- I find it a little annoying, but hey, that's just my opinion. Anyways, atop numerous directorial debuts, this one belongs to a young man named Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Don Jon explores the issue that is porn addiction, and believe it or not, people, it actually exists just like sex addiction. We follow a guido-like character named (Don) Jon (played by JGL) who usually has his way of women. He lives through a strict work-out schedule, balancing it with his daily porn and a night out at the club to pick out the next skank. This casually patterns his life until he unexpectedly meets a 'dime' (perfect/'10' woman), Barbara who's played by none other than Scarlett Johansson. Now, right from the get-go, a film with as edgy of a plot is bound to stir controversy, and so, it's no surprise that there's been a noticeable backlash against the film by- most likely- conservative critics. I'm assuming not everyone's comfortable with viewing a man enjoying masturbation or countless clips of pornography, but I guess it's not that easy to keep an open mind either. Contrary to what those shallow individuals claim, I loved the film, especially since it satirizes romantic comedies and incredibly narrow-minded gals and men, which overtly inhabit our society in its present state. The film essentially and cleverly points out how closed-minded people really act these days. Frankly, I consider women with impossibly high standards in the looks department much sluttier and repulsive than the ones who 'do it' with a wide range of folk. The film explores such truly meaningful and relevant themes; people simply possess too high of standards nowadays, and it's this desire for what we perceive as pure perfection in a significant other. A considerable amount of females habitually watch romantic comedies, and thus, leave the movie theater with this dreamy hope that someday they'll find a Channing Tatum. On the opposite side of the spectrum, lots of males consistently view porn because they lack that kind of excitement in their sex lives. After enjoying aggressive penetration (please don't mind the graphic language) in their pornographic material, they wholly expect a similar outcome for their upcoming night, but they're constantly disappointed. So, both genders ridiculously grab onto these unrealistic expectations in the end. Just dial it back on the over-reliance on physical looks (that's what I call a real slut/whore in my dictionary) and just get to know a human being- talk to them and balance out your preferences for god's sake. These similar issues can be witnessed in Jon's and Barbara's relationship as both cling on to their own expectations for one another and proceed through a bumpy road. Moving on from a major element of the film, the feature also benefits from terrific editing as it rhythmically cuts through an abundance of porn clips which coincide with Jon's daily schedule and progressing story, and it's this bouncing back between various activities and material at a fast pace that makes Don Jon that much more appealing. In addition, the film certainly has its fair share of exceptional performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt (his character, himself, is fascinatingly complex and something different), Tony Danza (playing his father whom I believe gives one of the best supporting performances of the year in its sheer authenticity), Scarlett Johansson (sporting a convincing New Jersey accent), and Julianne Moore (who contributes a dramatic tone to the film's later half). On top of that, the script/dialogue feels utterly genuine where you're strongly entertained and immersed in these realistic conversations that Woody Allen's films became popular for. And with that, here I'll have to digress with this strange issue critics develop towards films with occasional tonal shifts. How, in any way, does a shift in tone conflict with quality? Yes, I understand if a silly, over-the-top comedy becomes a grim and touching drama, but if a satirical comedy (in case you didn't know, it's not really as funny as a dumb, simple comedy because of the underlying- usually unfortunate- reality behind it) becomes a heart-felt drama and finally forms a sense of seriousness and misfortune, it's not that big of a deal! Every (good) comedy eventually reaches that point in its plot where the themes begin to pour out more clearly, and that's what happens in Don Jon's last half. Don't get me wrong; the film is uproariously hilarious, but it gets serious and matter-of-fact right when it needs to. Life's not all fun and games- believe it or not- and intelligent films usually carry more depth than elementary sexual and crude humor (not referring to Don Jon's style of humor). Albeit a slightly abrupt and inconclusive ending, you suddenly start to realize perhaps that's the whole point. Life doesn't have a definitive climax to it unless you call death a climax. It's great for a moviegoer to have the kind of standpoint where you believe you're entering a specific period of an individual's life- it's only that part and nothing else. It's like the camera just decided that this was the most interesting segment of their life and decided to peak in during that span and then called it quits at the right moment. Furthermore, I absolutely recommend Don Jon to those who take film seriously as an art form, not as a basic medium to only lie back and experience some dumb fun with. So far, we're off to an amazing start for this fall.",9,6,12,29 September 2013
Black Mass," Yes, Gangsters Are Actually Terrifying!
","Black Mass, Hollywood's newest mafia entry directed by Scott Cooper, follows the true story of Boston's baleful phantom during the 70's and 80's: Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp). Hearing his name now just chills you to the bone. The film commences with an FBI interrogation with one of Bulger's crewmen, Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), and as the conversation carries on, it slowly builds up to finally saying that name. 'I need to know everything you know about the Winter Hill gangand, specifically, what you know about your former bossand now fugitive JAMES WHITEY BULGER.' As soon as you hear his name uttered in such a solemn tone—mixed with Weeks' dour countenance—the exact significance behind this legend is impactfully conveyed.Told through convenient voice-over, we retrace Bulger's beginnings all the way through his rise and, eventually, his downfall. Initially, the film's flaws were drastically more pronounced for me: it was quite unfocused in its direction, telling an overly familiar gangster tale that felt slightly messy and poorly-paced in its execution. Too much screen-time is paid to some of the rather uninteresting elements of this otherwise endlessly fascinating history. What kept me genuinely enthusiastic and engaged though were the incredible performances across the board, the majority of which are unfortunately brief but exceptionally memorable from the likes of Dakota Johnson (as Whitey's wife), Julianne Nicholson, and Peter Sarsgaard in particular. In addition, Joel Edgerton continues to prove his pure thespian prowess; he's just utterly captivating and dedicated in every role, and here, he becomes just as detestable as Matt Damon in The Departed–a foolish yet manipulative weasel. Of course, the other standout is Johnny Depp's terrifying portrayal of Bulger–easily his best showcase in the past five years.Now, the cast and crew seem to be flip-flopping on their intentions in terms of properly handling this character. Suddenly, they're clarifying that they wanted to humanize Whitey, and that has ultimately become the annoyingly uninspired cliché of modern biopics and cinema, in general. Everyone has to be humanized; the most despicable figures in our world's history have to be humanized because it makes it oh-so-complex. Regardless of what the filmmakers claim, I saw little to no humanity in Bulger's face–his irritated mannerisms and enigmatic contemplations– which was certainly fitting in this case. It makes for a more unique venture in a genre that always tries to create sympathy and relatability out of the criminals–yes, he's soulless; he's morally vacant; and he is just as shallow as you would think. And like most biopics, the film is more so a rushed series of events in this subject's life, followed by the usual verbose 'what happened to everyone afterwards?' outro before the cut to credits, rather than actually thematic and narrative cohesion.With that being said, it's been six days since I viewed Black Mass but the more I reflected on its substance since, the more eager I've been to write up a review and get some things off my chest. As a result of the frankly unoriginal criticisms that have been thrown at this film (accusing it of simply mimicking Scorsese in a fruitless way), Black Mass's refreshing inventiveness to the genre remains understated. The fact of the matter is that never (or, at least, rarely) do we get to see actual anti-gangster pictures. No, we have Goodfellas and The Godfather and The Departed–all films that either create amusement and fun out of such twisted individuals or, essentially, turn them into dignified badasses for entertainment sake. 'Man, these guys are so cool; they're alpha-males with so many friends and so much power and bam bam bam!' Black Mass, however, treats this environment like an unmitigated horror movie. There's nothing romanticized or hilarious about the disturbingly authentic murders here, not to mention the totally demented look on Depp's face–his decaying teeth biting his lip, and those frightening deep blue eyes forever widening–as he mercilessly chokes the life out of a possibly innocent young woman. The powerfully haunting and sinister score by Tom Holkenborg superbly complements the arrantly dreary atmosphere of South Boston in these times.Much like Foxcatcher was a downright condemnation of (competitive) sports, the similarly morose grayness in the shot compositions here makes Black Mass an undeniable condemnation of this community (even though it's not nearly as thematically profound as the former). There is absolutely nothing cool about these people. Perhaps you'll lambast Depp's overt make-up for making him appear a whole lot like a vampire– even if that's true, in a way, that's certainly an interesting and effective way to exhibit the sheer eeriness of this unbelievable being; in fact, it might as well parallel the bloodthirstiness of a vampire, lurking in the shadows and prone to attack when you least expect it. Aside from Al Capone, he was the most notorious mobster who actually found his way atop the FBI's Most Wanted list right next to Osama Bin Laden–a mythic unstoppable figure that signaled dark times for Boston indeed.",7,0,0,29 September 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Caps, a Widow, and Fury
","Boy, after last year's mess that was Iron Man 3 and the proceeding mediocre Thor 2, my expectations couldn't get any lower for Marvel movies. I mean, there's really nowhere to go but up, and the hype and praise surrounding Cap's latest adventure had me curious on whether or not this would be the movie where Marvel would finally dare to take more risks and establish a less goofy and embarrassing tone. Now, of course, this is one of those crowd-pleasing blockbusters where if a critic bashes the film for a certain flaw, all the rabid fans will suddenly enter a defensive, fanatic stance and refuse to accept the criticism. Frankly, I don't care. I'm not a comic book fanboy. I'm not a superhero fanboy, and I'm certainly not the biggest fan of the countless dumb blockbusters we have nowadays. Basically, what I'm saying is that I'm going to be completely honest, fully aware that everyone else has only been saying good things about the movie. First of all, let's, at least, credit the film for its substantial improvements in certain areas. Guess what? This follow-up isn't pervaded with cheesy humor like Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 was. With those installments, every other utterance exiting the characters' mouths was a one-liner or quip. With such excessiveness, it began to feel like all the characters in the Marvel universe have the exact same personalities: witty, smug, and not taking anything happening around them seriously. Given, we still have those same recurrences here, just to a thankfully smaller extent. There's more drama and intrigue this time around—you knowactually making it feel like a superhero movie and not a parody of one. In fact, The Winter Soldier is a fresh take on the superhero genre as we're suddenly presented with an espionage thriller that implements quite a bit of suspense and mystery into its plot. How surprised I was to discover that there was no unnecessary on-screen romance tossed in (big shocker for Hollywood!). Wait, you mean Captain America doesn't stumble into a bar and catch the eye of a horny blonde in the back, stimulating a pointless and interfering arc throughout the rest of the film? No! None of that happens here because the focus is all on the threat and the large ensemble of characters involved. Instead what follows are incredibly intense, entertaining action sequences and monumental set pieces that introduce a fine amount of more close-quarters combat rather than non-stop gunplay. It's definitely more amusing to see Captain America fight than his peers, Thor and Iron Man. In addition, and more related to the story, itself, I found the arc with SHIELD and its outcome utterly fascinating as the big militaristic organization draws interesting parallels with America's undeniably aggressive agencies and foreign policies. I consider the notion of completely flipping things around and casting SHIELD in a whole 'nother (evil) light a pleasant risk that Marvel Studios took here; the most compelling of which is the conception that there's really a lack of variance between Hydra and SHIELD. People might be brainwashed into thinking one belligerent organization is better than the other, but in the end, they just have different targets but essentially the same methods, perfectly exemplified by the line 'we don't negotiate' as an enemy is taken down earlier in the film. However, now that I've applauded the film, let's get down and dirty. I know that everyone's so excited about how much of a spy thriller this new chapter turned out to be, but that doesn't erase the fact that Marvel Studios still hasn't learned how to produce an unpredictable, high-stakes superhero film yet. In every Marvel movie thus far, we face an enormous, over-the-top conflict/threat that means the end of the world, but the whole irony is in the actuality that there's absolutely no peril felt. This could be a spoiler for the film, but the studio is just really scared of killing off major—minor, you name it—characters, or, at the very least, inserting some form of loss for the danger of the situation to actually be discerned or for the villains to be proved formidable. I haven't thought much of any villains in the Marvel universe to this point because they never cause a shocking permanent amount of damage to society/institution or never even kill any of the major characters. See, what makes this all even more infuriating is that Marvel constantly teases the idea. With every film, a significant character is killed off at some point in the film only to return later on due to whatever nonsensical excuse like being revived thanks to some deus ex machina or a silly scheme that was planned out from the get-go. By now, I never believe that any of the deaths which transpire are totally real. That, alone, kills most of the suspense that any other espionage thriller absolutely needs. Continuing on, I honestly don't find Captain America that captivating or, frankly, that necessary of a superhero. 'Oh, look at me. I'm powerful because of my rebounding shield!' There's not much creativeness that was put into the construction of his character and not enough distinction to separate him from the other superheroes. And on a completely unrelated side note, man, was that last post-credits scene totally wasted and lame. All in all, though, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is clearly a vast improvement on its predecessors with its smarter, more thoughtful plot and its merging with the thriller genre, but it still suffers from being too damn predictable in how its characters end up and the lack of impactful, truly threatening villains.",6,0,2,13 April 2014
Interstellar," Nolan's Interstellar Is Modern-Day Kubrick
","We've been asking ourselves this same question for decades: what is humanity's and the earth's future? As much as some passé, clueless members of society continue denying the evidence of global warming and other detrimental environmental changes, science shows that Earth won't be able to sustain itself with the selfish manner in which humanity chooses to live. Then again, the fact that we act without further thought beyond our own self-interests is no revelation, but Interstellar herein shows the years ahead of heavy dust storms that riddle individuals with lung diseases and asthma (rising reports of asthma among people nowadays isn't news either)–reminiscent of the 1930's Dust Bowl, only to a considerably more dire extent. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) discovers that this planet will eventually die and that humanity will have to travel into the vast depths of the universe for a new home in order to survive. For humanity to continue, we need new discoveries—new pioneers. And so, Cooper is forced to leave his children behind in hopes of preserving their futures and thus launches into space as one of the best pilots left with a group of NASA explorers (including Anne Hathaway) to test the fascinating possibilities of space travel on a search for potential habitats where humans can continue their existence. In the meantime, his son and daughter (Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain in their later years, respectively) longingly wait for the chance that their father will perhaps one day return. This monumental and optimistic tale is about the utter capability of mankind and the necessity for human progress. Sadly, with the way modern generations behave and also considering the mentalities of even older ones, Interstellar could've easily been a cynical view of our prospects, but nonetheless, this human curiosity and aspiration that has gotten us this far into the future—the multitudinous stupendous technologies and the astonishing discoveries—can only inspire us to carry that attitude forward. 'We must think not as individuals, but as a species.' As we see Cooper's face inside a space helmet and a reflection of space's vastness on the glossy visor, we're immediately transported back to the ahead-of-its-time Stanley Kubrick classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Walking out of the movie theater with a brain currently under repair, I couldn't help but smile at the fact that this generation now can proudly say they have their own 2001. On that note, it's also fair to say that you're intellectually helpless at that moment, and that Christopher Nolan's latest insane conception has left you entirely perplexed. Interstellar is so compacted with abstract, intricate scientific theories and thought-provoking philosophical themes that it's nearly impossible to wrap your mind around the film on a first viewing. Like 2010's Inception (only to an even greater degree), while the first time wildly impresses you with grandeur and ambition, it will probably require a few more viewings to truly appreciate the sheer depth and genius of the package. Unlike A Space Odyssey though, Interstellar is thankfully a lot friendlier to the mainstream crowd, and this is what I'll always admire about Nolan as a filmmaker. His films are never just plodding visual treats that primarily exist to present a broad idea after idea. Those complicated concepts are also supported by an incredibly gripping narrative with an actually intelligible, generously scripted plot. It's very well possible to sufficiently understand the overall story, the character's motivations, and the conclusion here; it's just the overly audacious and complex details behind and in between those plot points that truly open up the film to analysis years from now. The same way we scrutinize many Kubrick pictures even to this day, Interstellar might likely follow in that same vein with the probable release of numerous think pieces and fan videos that believe they finally have the full explanation to the movie's events and ideas. This surely being Nolan's most divisive film, among critics and audiences alike, certainly might support that notion—like with so many classics, Interstellar could just be ahead of its time, only to be enriched in the eyes of many people years later. Beyond a narrative of incredible scope and ambitious structure, Hoyte Van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography immerses us that much more with real footage of the sky above and the camera's movement that perfectly responds to the perilous, tremulous events that follow one another on this incessantly tense journey. We see wide beautiful shots of glaciers and the menacing, yet wholly alluring, sight of that constantly imposing, threatening nature of space (from the black holes to the gargantuan planets). Hans Zimmer's epically harmonic score (tamer/more minimalistic than his previous work with Nolan, yet more emotionally resonant) excellently establishes that grand wonder of space exploration but also the frightening thought of the sheer danger that makes the universe's immensity. The reverberant sound effects and psychedelic visuals that accompany this grandiose adventure make for an unbelievable cinematic memory that will unlikely be replicated for decades to come. On the other hand, the film does face frustrating sound mixing issues—many moments feature loud music or sound effects that lengthily drown out dialogue. Especially given McConaughey's nearly-whispering diction, this unfortunate technical element clearly doesn't alleviate moviegoers' confusion with the story in the first place.

Pacific Rim," A colossal summer blockbuster that can rightfully be called 'epic'
","After the masterpiece that was Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy installments, Guillermo Del Toro (who's one of the most capable filmmakers in the industry today) has launched his first mega- blockbuster that rivals the grandness and intensity of Michael Bay's Transformers franchise itself. Now, from hearing about it and viewing the trailers left and right, Pacific Rim seemed frighteningly similar to the Transformers films, and I began to doubt the quality that'd shape the movie. Thus, my expectations weren't particularly as high as they could be. On that note, I'm here judging Pacific Rim as a full-fledged action blockbuster and nothing else. I won't be comparing it to thought-provoking dramas or hilarity-ensuing comedies. No, I'll be comparing it to action flicks, especially the Transformers series and how it actually far excels the quality of those movies. First of all, Pacific Rim is epic in every sense of the word (though I've used that word far too excessively at this point). Its scale is colossal- beyond that of almost any summer blockbuster that has preceded it. The film promises intense and grandiose battles between gargantuan monsters and mechs/robots, and it absolutely delivers on that. Once you're engaged in one of these fights, you're able to witness the spectacular audio that erupts from the speakers as every hit taken booms in your ear as if the whole event is real. This is also meshed with the terrific soundtrack that complements the grandeur and 'larger-than-life' feel of the movie. With that being said, above all the other 'pros' of this movie, there's the breathtaking visuals that few summer blockbusters can actually compare to. Seeing the colorful streets of Hong Kong and then eyeing the water splashing as a lizard fights a gigantic mech nearby delivers such a visual spectacle that anyone would feel highly satisfied with. Of course, this experience is even more wonderful if you're watching it in IMAX 3D (the way I wisely chose to see it). At moments, it actually feels like you're underwater in the deep bowels of the ocean and whatnot. There is no doubt that the production value of Pacific Rim is incredible, and that'd just be an understatement. On top of that, there's the human aspect of the film (similar to that of the Transfomers films), which is filled with great acting, especially from Idris Elba who I must say steals the show. Everyone who's seen him on The Wire already knows what this exceptional actor is capable of. Anyways, there's a fair amount of comedy provided as well from the likes of Charlie Day and Ron Pearlman, and this time, it's actually funny. Ron Pearlman plays an arrogant tough guy by the name of Hannibal Chau, and he's just one of the other high points of the film. But then, there's the main character of the film, Travis Beckett (played by Charlie Hunnam), who's just kind of a bland individual with little personality, which is why it's easy to see how great the supporting characters are around him. As you can see, this is where I have a little bit of complaints to state about the film. Since this is another Hollywood blockbuster, you can't be too surprised when you witness the fair share of clichés that fill the movie with the generic bully fights and rescues, etc. This is what diminished the satisfaction received from the ending- it's that it ended the way you would expect it to end; yet another predictable Hollywood action flick. And as we all well know, the ending is one of the most important elements of a film, and when a film ends typically, it just doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Then, there's the pacing, which seems to suffer midway through the movie as you begin to notice that the film is dragging out a little, and some are probably checking the time at that point. Also, ignoring the special-effects audio, due to so many characters with accents in the film, it's often difficult to hear what those characters are even talking about, which messes up the story for me; at times, I felt confused as to what exactly is supposed to transpire. Furthermore, as an action movie and nothing more, Pacific Rim, without a doubt, delivers, but its not-too-memorable ending and abundant Hollywood clichés doesn't make it as decent as it could've been. Nonetheless, I highly advise anyone interested in action flicks (especially since the past year's blockbusters like Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel have been mediocre) to see the film in IMAX 3D, and only then will you appreciate it and understand what a proper action movie should truly be like.",7,1,6,19 July 2013
American Sniper," A Dubious Portrait of American Patriotism
","The heavily disturbing image of the Twin Towers falling to their burning end and of people leaping off from its heights lit an unstoppable fire in many Americans on that day. Since then, many patriotic Americans have enlisted in the army, hoping to find some form of fulfilling resolution to all this terror. Some of them even agree with the war's never-ending duration in that it will protect the homeland from any other terrorists as long as they 'protect and serve.' American Sniper follows the true story of one of these soldiers: Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper)—a tall, sturdy All-American who continually chooses to leave his beautiful wife, Taya (Sienna Miller), and later on his two sweet kids for the sake of protecting this ultimate American ideal. He's a man who truly believes in the war, and thus, he also turned out to be the deadliest sniper in US history with a confirmed kill rate of 160 people throughout his tours of duty. How could a human even tolerate the responsibility and sight of so many corpses and gore without a particular psychological toll? Well, unsurprisingly, the answer is that one can't, and Kyle only displays the kind of issue here that many individuals choose to irresponsibly gloss over when they're on a support campaign for war: PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). Following yet another visit to Iraq, he comes home to the pain of looming anxiety and lengthy sessions of completely zoning out from reality. With American Sniper, Clint Eastwood manages to create a thoroughly intense war film. As the deafening gunshots ring around the IMAX audience, the film's meticulous sense of gritty realism ensures to keep the viewers in pervasive suspense. Even when Kyle isn't focusing on deadly shots at a suspicious man's or kid's head, the brilliantly tense score sounds off with a foreboding build-up of what sounds like a sniper rifle reloading, followed by its haunting discharge, so as to never ease the tension in the room and keep us on the edge of our seats. There's no way I can emphasize the excellence of the sound use enough (the sound mixing and editing) in this epic, installing you into an observational post right there on the battlefield as many get blown to bits left and right. It's rough; it's graphically violent; it's unsettling. Bradley Cooper once again makes a smart choice for his latest role; this one though might not be as showy as his performance in Silver Linings Playbook, but his distressed eyes and failing psychological condition tell us everything we need to know through his journey. In which case, it's also supported by an impressive actress in Sienna Miller who works with fairly little material but adds so much more of her own emotional meat into the role than expected. The look of worry never leaves her face; even for those small intimate moments of family time and reunions with her husband in which excitement and merriment briefly spring out, she eventually returns to her emotional default—to a sort of declining hope for the future of a soldier's life. It's a shame Miller isn't receiving more attention in the awards circuit. In sum, from a technical level, American Sniper is one of the more memorable experiences in the modern war genre, but when we regard what's supposed to be an enthralling narrative, we start to witness questionable elements. Like with Angelina Jolie's Unbroken, the major problem here is the sheer closeness to its subject. As the narrative flows along, it becomes more transparent just how much of a tribute American Sniper intends to be to Chris Kyle's legacy, followed in the end by the standard biopic footage that shows us the outcomes of his life and history. Eastwood's obvious jingoistic attitude here unfortunately adds a lot of bias when an objective and more intelligent perspective would've made for a far more fascinating study of a man who has sniped and brutally killed more people (whether innocent or genuinely criminal) than a normal human being can possibly endure in a state of sanity. There is no absolute morality in this tale as right as (simplistically) cheering on your nation, no matter what, sounds. Every time American Sniper hints at hesitation from its protagonist, it refutes any possible anti-war arguments by reverting to blind patriotism again and again through heroic dialogue, the numerous American flags sighted across the movie's mise en scène, and the obvious tributary segments. 'This war was just destiny, and it's up to us to enthusiastically back America up in its undoubtable bravery and (supposed) righteousness,' says American Sniper. Then again, considering something as heavy-handedly named as the film's very own title, you know exactly what position in the debate it will take.

Southpaw," Gyllenhaal Does Most of the Punching
","Actors, studying how to make the most out of their careers, need only look at Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliant role-selecting strategies. Last year, he completely freaked us out as an emaciated, bug-eyed nightcrawler. Fast forward eight months later, and he's suddenly a burly furious boxer with an incredible eight-pack. The man seems to be challenging himself past intensity as a thespian, putting him on the same track as Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Joaquin Phoenix in terms of sheer range. Antoine Fuqua's Southpaw gives us a gut- wrenching look into champion boxer Billy Hope's life–a man who seems to be living the American Dream, displaying pure ferocity in the ring and taking hard punches to the face like an unfazed rock only to deliver the final blow. Every night, he comes back to a stupendous mansion and to a beautiful wife and kid (poignantly played by Rachel McAdams and Oona Laurence)until all the walls around him start crumbling.As a moviegoer who entered the theater expecting a Rocky-like sports drama, I was pleasantly surprised by the immediate dark turn the movie takes. All of a sudden, gunshots are ringing, and Billy is slipping a hood over his head with a silver firearm tucked into his pants and his face convulsing with unalloyed fury. In Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal was this absolute Machiavellian, deliberating his every move and knowing where each piece fits. In Southpaw, he's taken one too many punches to the skull and is absolutely clueless in his current state of circumstances, unable to direct his own life without the help of his wife, Maureen. A blatant lack of intelligence and an undisciplined lifestyle is more or less sending him down the opposite path from Lou Bloom. It's through yet another undeniably powerful performance though that we feel the utmost pity and sympathy for the once-celebrated Billy Hope as the luxurious carpet is swept from under his feet.Fuqua's very urban and gritty visual style is a perfect fit for this subject matter, capturing the boxing scenes with the greatest level of authenticity. Gyllenhaal, himself, rigorously trained in the gym for many months so that he could fully sink into this boxer's skin rather than allow a stunt double to take the glory, which beautifully translates into what looks like just another HBO PPV fight. With sweat spraying and blood spurting in slow motion, everything makes us feel tense while the visceral energy on the screen is clearly pulsating. At times, the ferocious pummeling is even shot in first-person as the audience sees monstrous fists/gloves flying at the screen.Unfortunately, it's in the second hour where little can be done to add any freshness into the plot, and thus all the innovative effort is concentrated in the pivotal boxing segments. In those moments, Fuqua and cinematographer Mauro Fiore utilize the coolest angles and camera techniques in order to dramatically convey to the fullest extent how this man really is fighting for his livelihood. Again—when it comes to its narrative—as soon as the film reaches the second hour, Southpaw apparently has no other tricks up its sleeve and consequently reverts to the old sports-drama formula that has been recycled for decades since Rocky's thunderous release. Critic Scott Tobias said it best on the Filmspotting podcast: 'it's a Rocky movie that thinks it's Raging Bull.'Suddenly, its edginess begins to subside at a rapid rate and so does Billy Hope's savagely aggressive, anti-hero temperament. Essentially, it transitions from an initial hour of gripping unpredictability and emotional turmoil to a second hour of wild predictability and banality. Hope's redemptive arc is sharply evident at that point. And this is exactly what frustrates me about the sports movie genre in general: there's very little room for original storytelling anymore. There's only so much you can do in this limited space: either the underdog wins or loses in the end. (The only sports films I hold dear are Raging Bull, Moneyball, Foxcatcher, and of course, Rocky.) It's okay though; even when the story dulls and loses its flare, Gyllenhaal's impeccable vehemence is enough to keep us glued to the screen. Whenever he steps into that ring and the match commences, any Hollywood artificiality immediately wanes. There are no actors on-screen anymore; we're just witnessing two fighters swiftly jabbing one another.",7,0,2,29 July 2015
Ant-Man," Paul Rudd vs. The Marvel Formula
","Imagine if a female co-lead went through an entire Marvel movie without kissing the protagonist. Imagine a Marvel villain who has realistic motivation and a complex personality. Imagine a Marvel plot that is confident enough to refrain from utilizing humorous quips after every line of exposition. Okay, do you have that vision of a unique superhero movie in your head? Well, you might want to hold on to that idea and head to Marvel Studios with your pitch in the future because Ant-Man offers none of that. It is a little structurally different; instead of a non-stop explosive superhero vs. supervillain tale (a la Age of Ultron), it's actually a heist moviethe same way Captain America 2 is a 'spy movie,' of course. That means that it's not exactly edgy or narratively revelatory; it's just a refreshing take for kids and families new to the genre.Ant-Man centers around an adept thief, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), who has just been released from prison . After failing to reconcile with his family, he is again forced into another heist operation after discovering a miraculous suit that transforms one into an ant—the perfect capability for a man who's required to sneak through various tunnels and vents. I guess I'd have to thank Marvel this time on not giving us another abnormally muscular and chiseled hero. No, we get Paul Rudd, and you know how everyone has their man-crush even though they don't want to admit it? Well, Rudd is definitely mine. The guy is so charming, and thankfully, Marvel allows his quirky-toned sarcastic humor to truly shine from time to time here. He's the perfect man to play this goofball who ruins emotional moments between father and daughter and endlessly struggles to finally adapt to his superhuman abilities, and that's why he's one of the best characters/heroes in this universe alongside the guardians of the galaxy. Unfortunately, he somewhat gets lost in the shuffle as Michael Douglas brings his terrific acting chops along and Evangeline Lilly once again showcases her sheer badassery (the woman refuses to pick gender-humiliating roles).At that point, Rudd is expected to just stick to his guns and play the typical action hero with the ultimate goal to save the world. The more I think about it though, the more I absolutely love the cast that was assembled for this film—probably Marvel's most intimate and lowest- budgeted production. We also get Michael Peña and rapper TI together, and they totally deliver when it comes to nicely-balanced comic relief (even though Peña is basically playing the Mexican stereotype). These two are not solely present for a couple of scenes. No, Peña is given ample screen-time to steal the screen whenever he's there, rambling on with his convoluted monologues that bounce from stories about one contact of his to another and on and on until we finally get to the point with a dumbfounded expression on our faces. It's certainly one of the film's most clever elements, which makes me wonder if it was due to Edgar Wright's prior involvement (before he unfortunately left the set for a new director, Peyton Reed, to step in—few films made me lose enthusiasm quite as fast as the day those news came out a year ago).Now, I feel like I mention this every year, but Marvel simply doesn't understand the importance of introducing stakes into films and occasionally taking itself seriously in order to successfully convey the true danger of the situation. This movie, more than any other of theirs, commits this narrative crime. It continues to juxtapose action scenes between Ant-Man and his equally-sized rival with a wider shot that reveals just how silly this concept is. So, for example, Ant-Man's fighting on a train with the villain in what looks to be a cool action sequence. Cut to a further shot that reminds us this epic fight is really transpiring on a toy train, which lightly bumps into another object. At this point, Marvel is more focused on producing a light comedy that we can all laugh at than a legitimate action movie with a menacing villain and a hero who's fighting against the odds.On the other hand, Douglas is given a lot of meat to work with in a role that I surely appreciated. He's a once-successful scientist who chose to shut his work and the company behind him only for the wrong person to take his place. His daughter, Hope (Lilly), continues to profess her desire to stop this corporation from leading down the wrong scientific path while also working there. She's the kind of female character that's understandably stubborn and ambitious at first only to hand over the reins to the leading man halfway into the movie. 'Okay, my work here is done. Time to let you save the worldand now I just really want to be with you even though we spent a lot of time competing with each other earlier in the film.' When we go back and consider Black Widow and Gamora in addition, we come to the epiphany that Marvel can't resist the temptation to create boring and useless female characters. Speaking of boring, phenomenal actor Corey Stoll plays this evil mastermind, Darren Cross, who plans to use these shrinking experiments/technologies for–of course– murderous means. It's yet another villainous role in this world that has nothing to offer beyond 'I'm evil just because!'Continue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/ant-man-review/",6,2,9,22 July 2015
American Hustle," American Splendor
","'Everyone hustles to survive,' and that's the picture American Hustle's '70's quintessentially paints for the culture and mentality of America. Our very economic system encourages for loops to be taken as long as you secure those wads of cash, and, in the end, the easiest targets will receive the boot into a jail cell rather than the powerful and resourceful (the crooked and corrupt bankers and politicians who deserve to share a moniker with other criminals). Anyways, the whole concept is devoid of any sense of morality, and that essentially grooms Irving Rosenfeld (played by Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (played by Amy Adams) for the big leagues of scamming and reaping the riches. However, once they're finally caught by an FBI agent- Richie DiMaso (played by Bradley Cooper)- their sole responsibility is to catch a bunch of dirty politicians red-handed in bribery, and they're in charge of constructing the whole procedure. There's no doubt that American Hustle gives off that 'Goodfellas' vibe and is generally influenced by Scorsese's masterful work, but it also decides to incorporate even further playfulness. David O. Russell's signature style of directing in which he implements humor into the tensest or most dramatic of scenes returns. All throughout, I found myself confused if certain scenes were meant to be slightly funny or fully serious. Though I chuckled during some mainly parlous scenes that played out in a more outlandish manner (which instituted that element of humor), the majority of the theater room sat in silence. What I'm trying to say is that it's an incredibly fun ride. First of all- and, in my opinion, most importantly- we witness some of the most brilliant, captivating, and intricate performances of this year from the likes of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner- an all-star cast! Christian Bale, most evidently, remarkably strays from a recognizable appearance and instead sports an atrocious, but equally comical, haircut, an actual beer belly, and a Jersey accent. In sum, the guy transforms like no other. Moreover, all of these characters are granted their time to shine, and they all truly stand out with their own distinctive personalities. Russell means to emphasize this: it's all about the characters who glow with exuberance and complicacy. An abundance of fun is had by placing some of the most vibrant individuals into a complex predicament and then simply watching how they attempt to dig themselves out of such an extensive hole. Not only are we joyful at the sight of an obviously talented cast- not one stealing another's thunder- but we're also surprised by some brilliant- brilliant- cameos. The flamboyancy of these characters greatly stem from a terrific script that provides us with clever and hilarious dialogue. See, this cinematic wonder is so damn quotable as every other line carries amusement and farcicality with it. In addition, the intriguing narrative is serviced by an outstanding soundtrack, recalling the greatest '70's tunes (those violins are just daunting in 10538 overture- amazing track, by the way). With that being said, the plot becomes a little confusing at times, especially at the beginning. The whole plan is so elaborate that the structure and details within moderately threw me off. One has to possess a somewhat clear idea of how the entire financial scamming business works in order to completely understand the more prominent events. A considerable amount of the confusion is thankfully removed as the story progresses and we hear Bale's explanative narration over the wild occurrences. Furthermore, the picture commences with noticeably slow pacing as we take the time to familiarize ourselves with the characters and their backgrounds. It definitely reminded me of Casino's fairly sluggish opening in which De Niro explains the multiple processes and conveys the nature of the crime-riddled environment we're about to be cast down into. Finally, when the scheme is set into motion, that's when the storyline picks up as we see the countless characteristics of these peculiar individuals make their mark. Overall, American Hustle is an exceptional piece of cinema that delivers on what it promises. Normally, a predominantly nonviolent crime tale would feel strange and unfulfilling, but Russell knows exactly what he's doing here. With the help of superb and rich performances from A-list actors, this crime drama feels fun, suspenseful, risible, and impeccably crafted (considering the sublime costumes and the impressively effective presentation of the 70's).",9,1,9,22 December 2013
Rush," Do You Feel That Rush?!
","Wow, I never knew I'd be so engrossed in a film about racecars. The main reason behind that compliment is because the film delves into so much more than the sport itself, and that's essentially what makes a great sports movie and is why most of them basically suck, in my opinion. Rush, like Moneyball before it, fully concentrates on the drive (no pun intended) and soul behind the individuals who choose to take on such risky endeavors or sports in general. The picture overwhelmingly benefits from excellent performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl especially. Whereas James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) plays the stereotypical jock (ladies man, bad boy), Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) starts out as more of an underdog, at least, in terms of his social life. As he witnesses the environment James proudly surrounds himself with, that jealousy and bitterness can be clearly sighted in Niki's eyes. Thus, he gets down and dirty from the business side of things, and this leads to a momentous, highly personal rivalry where both persistently overpower the other with their own set of methods. As a result, the audience witnesses pure complexity and depth within these two characters with their own special backstories and circumstances; the film wisely takes the time to build each character's traits and personality up in order to create a much more satisfying ultimate showdown- the one element that always heightens the tension and popularity of a rivalry in sports: one where the opponents have fully- developed personas and distinctive characteristics. What only follows is the classic and brutal form of competition as the two racers threateningly eye each other before engaging in their next intense race. On this note, I just want to immensely praise the race sequences throughout the film, perfectly capturing the sheer adrenaline and danger of the lives these daredevils settle for. As the menacingly enormous tires of those cars loudly speed right by the camera, you immediately know you're in for the thrill of your life, meaning if you never receive the opportunity to experience such an event, this film will surely suffice. It is undoubtedly touching when the participants of these races suit up and equip those sizable helmets while knowing full well that their lives hang in the balance and their lives would mean nothing without raising the stakes. With that, the spectacular sound design considerably services these scenes with the thunderous rev of that engine and the sound of the aggressive pouring rain. Few sports movies (racing ones specifically) are able to pull off this downright level of excitement for the moviegoers are all invited to experience and participate in an incredibly immersive ride (again, no pun intended). As the adventurers race for the finish line, stoic and epically dramatic music (by the consistently-brilliant Hans Zimmer) kicks in, and as your eardrums sense the pleasure of the violins and percussion's presence, you look on to an equally grandiose occasion. Rush terrifically balances character development and characterization with these more exhilarating and athletically passionate sections. In fact, the pace is amazing since it never even felt like two hours had passed me by. You're glued to the screen from beginning to end, and there's not one segment that feels unnecessary or uneventful, and I'd go so far as to say that it's one of the best paced films of the last few years. In addition, the cinematography of the film is utterly breathtaking and beautiful, showcasing various weather conditions with the motivation of winning continuing and a display of power and vulnerability all at once as the characters resume their imposing nature. Last but not least, it's a gripping and powerful story, fueled by exceptional writing, in which two men commence a rivalry that would go on to involve numerous predicaments. I immediately identified with Niki (though ruthless in his rude behavior at first) as the underdog who feels defenseless but will go through whatever unconventional path it takes to furiously destroy his foe (who's a good man- don't be mistaken for a second- which avoids the clichés that usually infest sports movies). With that said, since the film was a sports movie at the end of the day, it still happened to lightly follow that similar structure most sports films incorporate, which creates a tad bit of predictability with its execution. Another element I just couldn't tolerate was the portrayal of the film's female characters. I did not find any of them likable at all. Most of them only 'hooked up' with the protagonists because of their fame and money, and it wouldn't be a detriment to the film if it was intentional but it seemingly wasn't. For instance, Olivia Wilde is befuddled when she learns that James Hunt isn't that big of a deal. 'Oh, you mean I'm not going to be sleeping with the biggest racecar star I thought he was?!' They were repulsive- however, Niki's 'soul mate' was a lot more tolerable even though the relationship didn't begin at the highest of notes. In sum, Rush is now absolutely on my list for Best Picture nominees. Damn, since the fall's start, that's been three fantastic films in a row (Don Jon, Prisoners, and Rush). This season will be quite competitive indeed.",9,2,3,1 October 2013
Nightcrawler," Crossing the Line Through Sheer Ambition
","Whereas Gone Girl explored the wild misconceptions and dangerous influence of the media, Nightcrawler explores another even more corrupted facet of the entity's nature: shamelessly capitalizing on the popularity of crime television—violence, murder, blood, gunshots. The program's ratings continue heightening along with the network's desire for even more thrilling footage. Nightcrawler follows Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) as he climbs up the ladder of success and builds a career through rash ambition. Lacking a formal education and adequate work experience, he's truly a victim of the unfair modern job market/unemployment. So, he says 'screw it' and takes matters into his own hands, acting with sheer desperation and eagerness to reach that level of power and affluence America so often glorifies. After personally witnessing a car accident on the freeway as snooping reporters close in, the scene lights a fire inside Louis and inspires him to give the job a try. Soon afterwards, he purchases a camcorder and a radio scanner, persistently discovering new crime scenes to capture on tape as intimately as he possibly can. Thus, his extensive coverage grabs the attention of a morning news channel, and a special relationship forms therein: a consistent supply of new gruesome/entertaining crime footage for an increasing sum of money. As we see the frightening lengths Louis is willing to strive towards in order to prove himself as a proficient workingman and elevate his value above and beyond, this grave thriller intermittently surprises us with effectively mocking twisted humor, but the incredibly deranged human psychology on display keeps us startled and tense throughout regardless. Gyllenhaal arguably gives the absolute best performance of his career in a role that substantially differentiates from his earlier work. His creepy, relaxed composure hides the true inner scariness and ferocity. Publicly, Louis is a professional, polite, and upstanding citizen who's just looking to work hard. Privately, he violently yells in front of a mirror until he shatters it, as well as blackmails a TV news director to further his career. Rene Russo also impresses as the morning news director—almost as daring in her lust for more provocative violent imagery—who's beguiled by this eccentric and only (mistakenly) fuels Louis' psychotic drive. In addition, Riz Ahmed's Rick serves as Louis' gullible, clueless 'employee' who just wants to escape the dispiriting state of homelessness and finally earn a living, completely unaware of the perilous and unethical situations he'll be cast in along his employer's selfishly ruthless path.This isn't the kind of film whose quality solely relies on a central performance because the narrative is just as cruelly gripping. Unfortunately, the film industry is stocked with so many safe crowdpleasers and compromising thrillers that it's wholly refreshing to see these uncompromisingly grim, chilling psychological character studies occasionally pop up. The film becomes more morally repulsive and disturbing as it proceeds while the satire on the American Dream and merciless ambition becomes that much more brutal. Nightcrawler is deeply unsettling as well as it is honest in its portrayal—Los Angeles is actually the perfect setting, beautifully shot in its alluring and deceptive nighttime scenery. After all, it is probably the #1 destination for the unrelentingly audacious and reckless individuals of the nation in search of a prosperous career.",9,164,209,2 November 2014
Man of Steel," Unfortunately, Man of Steel is just another generic superhero film among many
","Okay, after countless Superman films, including this one, I've finally come to the conclusion that the character just doesn't appeal to me in any way, shape, or form, and that could be exactly why there's not a single Superman film that I consider great. It's far too fantasy- based to see the film(s) (or anything for that matter) as anything but a superhero movie. If you don't mind, also, I'll be comparing this film to The Dark Knight trilogy (I know every movie has to be compared to them nowadays- it's annoying- but they're the perfect representation of superhero films done right, so) since it draws several similarities to the three films and is basically set in the same universe. Anyways, though it's been heavily marketed as a Christopher Nolan film, I find it distasteful to ignore the fact that it's truly Zack Snyder's film, and it's very clear once you've seen it since it focuses more on style- visuals, non-stop action, etc.- rather than substance like story and character development. The first half an hour essentially builds the back story for Superman- where he originated from, who his parents actually are, and how exactly he found himself on Planet Earth. The issue here is that the film did better explaining Superman/Kal-El's father's (Jor-El's) story than it did Superman's as it dedicated a considerable amount of screen time on Jor-El (played by Russell Crowe), and then when Superman's story finally came along, it brushed most of his childhood aside to get to the action as soon as possible. Right from the get-go, you don't see him as an adolescent or a teenager, you see him as a man, already in his 20's, working on a ship. The only way we see anything from his childhood is through flashbacks. The film basically turned out the way I was worried it would. For instance, Batman Begins did an incredible job at dedicating the majority of the film to introducing Bruce Wayne as an individual, not Batman right from the get-go, but then again, I guess very few filmmakers have artistic integrity in big-budget Hollywood nowadays since now, everyone's thinking about filling as much of their films with action as possible so that the average clueless Joe's come in waves. There's way, way too much action, and it reminds me of the dreadful time when Transformers 3 was released, and its finale was a large, bloated mess of unclear and incomprehensible action sequence after action sequence. Once Man of Steel commences, the action immediately begins with the intense battle in Krypton. This much action leaves little time for actual character development, and this leaves me thinking that Jor-El isn't as complex and interesting of a character as Bruce Wayne was. And for once, can the woman, who somehow gets involved in the whole conflict, not end up sleeping with the superhero just to make things a little less predictable and typical? That leads me to the next issue: it's so goddamn predictable just like mostly every other superhero film nowadays. Again, the Dark Knight trilogy was fairly unpredictable and unconventional in its ways, which is why the installments are beloved and remembered to this day. There's nothing unique about this film- nothing that helps it stand out from the large crowd. Every time someone's in peril, Superman comes out of nowhere and saves them. This is exactly what deteriorated The Dark Knight Rises's quality; it creates a total lack of suspense and that unpredictable edge that these kinds of films desperately need to avoid the generic fare they often turn out to be. One aspect that somewhat redeemed the film was the music. As usual, Hans Zimmer delivers with his incredibly epic and 'goosebumpy' music, which is what ultimately, effectively conveys the sheer grandeur and colossal scale of the film. The darker color/look of the film conveys a tone quite similar to the Dark Knight trilogy, as well as its music. In fact, though its music was spine-tingling, it had an extremely noticeable resemblance to the TDK trilogy's music. It practically sounded just like the music present in the Dark Knight Rises in some cases, but it was still pleasant to hear. The villain- mehforgettable as he rode around in his spaceship, paid Earth a visit in order to wreak some havoc a couple of times, and returned to his ship thereafter- rinse and repeat. Don't get me wrong: I strongly respect Michael Shannon and love his work, but he just didn't convey the menace he was supposed to. In terms of acting, I believe that Diane Lane stole the show since her acting was far beyond that of the rest of the cast. All in all, Man of Steel is just another summer blockbuster that has a high chance of being forgotten in the long run. Some comic book/superhero fanboys might enjoy it (and say that they love it), but they'll probably forget it until another Superman reboot releases. I give props to the visuals and special effects department, but there's nothing else to Man of Steel than just another Superhero film that'll rake in millions (perhaps billions) for Hollywood. I expected more from the same man who brought us Watchmen, but hey, if you're into heavily action-packed superhero films, I'm sure you'll reasonably enjoy this one. Otherwise, save your money for something with more substance.",5,1,3,14 June 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Still Agelessly Cruisin'
","I keep hearing that the Fast and Furious franchise is this epitome of a series in resurgence. Well, the latest Mission: Impossible entry comes quickly on the heels of Furious 7 and squashes that assertion. Instead of simply bloating its cast and pitting muscle-heads against one another, the Mission: Impossible series chooses to ramp up the sheer velocity of its action and the inventiveness of its setpieces. Rogue Nation reunites us with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) who's now searching for a secret terrorist organization named 'The Syndicate' (accidentally birthed from British intelligence) while his own agency, the IMF, is facing its own problems when the CIA and Senate oversight committee begin questioning its legitimacy. Yes, the convoluted type of plot is back, but that's honestly what keeps this brand of movies refreshing.Above all, Rogue Nation finds the perfect balance between a spy thriller and a purely volatile action movie. We see plenty of extended sequences where agents from different intelligence agencies share extensive dialogue about government secrets and confidential documents—the colors are worn out and the background is grayish. About ten minutes later, Hunt is suddenly zooming through Moroccan highways on a speed-bike in a wild chase. Sometimes, non-stop action can exhaust me (The Avengers 2 and The Expendables 3 being recent exemplars), but when one creative and memorable action sequence leads into another and then blends with another one, you can't help but excitedly tap your feet along and join the sweet ride. Contrary to the style of most modern action flicks, the destruction is executed so carefully and lucidly here. One segment, in particular, transpires within the beautiful edifice of a Vienna opera house as we see the pieces falling into their respective positions, slowly and tensely piling each detail/obstacle into the fray until everything collides into a delightfully (not exactly literal) explosive result.For some reason, I still struggle in believing that Tom Cruise actually performs his own stunts, which only seem to continually grow in apparent impossibility. How could he scale up the scary enormity that is the Burj Khalifa or speed-run and jump onto a plane taking off, hanging onto the hatch as the plane rises and rises to frightening heights? What kind of movie star has the balls for such risky ventures? In that case, the action choreography is absolutely spectacular, also managing to masterfully fuse itself with some noteworthy physical comedy. In addition to the sheer energy of these scenes, a terrific cast raises the level of entertainment to an even greater point, especially when you have such hilarious comic relief in Simon Pegg and a new female addition in up-and-coming actress, Rebecca Ferguson. She basically replaces Paula Patton with so much more emotional complexity, heroism, and an incredible skillset that easily rivals Ethan Hunt's with the two oftentimes fighting side-by-side throughout the films' duration. Thankfully, she isn't required to fill that dull romantic interest role; instead, Ilsa has a mysterious part in all this, and a lot of focus is paid to her well-rooted arc and its fair share of twists and turns.Continue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/mission-impossible-rogue- nation-review/",8,0,2,2 August 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," An Oscar-Baity Film That Takes Risks
","At this point, we seem to have a general idea of what films serve as the 'Oscar-baity' kind- the movies that explore homosexuality, illnesses, historical events like slavery, etc. Dallas Buyer's Club appeared to be yet another example based off of the promotions and premise alone, but I'm glad that the film took some daring risks with that notion. Instead of the archetypal sympathetic protagonist the Academy tends to prefer, Matthew McConaughey portrays the typical redneck: a bigot who despises the gays (or 'faggots' as he constantly names them) and seemingly possesses xenophobia as well, judging from his racially insulting remarks, but he ultimately ends up testing positive for HIV. On that note, I believe that this is definitely McConaughey's brightest performance in that he takes on a far different role instead of the heroic or, at least, moral characters he frequently personates. Dallas Buyer's Club refuses to incorporate the predictable and generic character developments that most famed stories depict with the protagonist usually learning from his past mistakes in a- frankly- forced and unnatural manner, and that's usually the picture that many 'Oscar-baity' films paint as the Best Actor winner plays a noticeably flawed human being who ends up loving the individuals he once spited once everything's been said and done. With this piece of cinema, McConaughey maintains fairly convincing progress throughout, never ceasing to exclaim profanity. In reality, believe it or not, there are absolutely the kinds of people that never change and persistently hold on to their prejudice or other various beliefs, no matter the advancement of certain circumstances. Even though the casual audience or corporate producers expect a stereotypical protagonist and that same ending (never once realizing that they're watching the exact same plot every single time), this instance refrains from that, but oh well, that's another conversation that'll be left to discuss later. Anyways, I respect that about the film, and I respect any film that centers on substantially flawed persons (ones who murder, hate, engage in other criminal activities, etc, etc.). So, in that regard, I totally applaud the focus on Ron Woodroof's (McConaughey's) arc. Jared Leto also delivers an exceptional performance as a transvestite who has tested positive for HIV as well, and though Leto fills in the shoes of a baity and unoriginal character that the Academy simply adore, one can't possibly ignore his captivating presence. Once the credits roll, I opine that the acting department is what essentially helps the film stand out. The story, itself, exposes the incompetence of the FDA and the medicinal industry, and although it was most relevant during that time period, it rings true nowadays likewise. However, the film felt quite lengthy despite the fact that it's less than two hours long. I'm not entirely sure if it was the pacing or the repetition within the plot, but the picture clearly didn't pass me by. In sum, despite the crucial substance the film offers in the form of corruption- notice that I'm not one of the moviegoers who're easily swept by all the hype and buzz- all I will discover myself raving about, once the year has come to a close, is its superb acting.",7,6,11,23 November 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Finally an Exceptional, Genuinely Humane Superhero Film!
","It was not too long ago when everyone felt like X-Men's prospects, as a franchise, were very bleak following mediocre and downright atrocious installments like X3: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Once the universe's creative vision fell into foreign hands, it simply lost its once-coveted flavor, spitting in the face of character accuracy and logicality. (In my honest opinion X-Men Origins opened up strongly only to end with a fairly benign and ridiculously silly showdown.) After a couple of failures, 20th Century Fox fell into panic and attempted to find some way—any way—to revive the franchise, which led to the excellence of First Class. That film's compelling focus on Eric's and Charles' relationship , as well as setting the X-Men into the 60's made that film what it was. Thankfully, we have that component of the 20th century returning to X- Men's latest adventure, Days of Future Past, where now the 1970's faces the dauntingly hostile machines called the Sentinels who are threatening the whole existence of mutants, thanks to a man named Dr. Trask (portrayed by Peter Dinklage) who has proposed this incredibly antagonistic method to dispose of people that apparently threaten mankind's way of life because they're 'different.' This means that Wolverine from the present (never explained but somewhere 50 years in the future) must travel back in time to reverse the events that led to the creation of these monstrous beings and therefore save the future for mutants and humans, alike. What elevates this film to prestigious heights is its impeccable cast and the exceptional performances given by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and of course, Hugh Jackman who's unbelievably charismatic as always. His humorous, mean-spirited approach to most situations keeps the story thoroughly entertaining, no matter what. I have no idea how the franchise will stand on its feet after Huge Jackman is done with the role and the obvious void which will be left thereafter. James McAvoy exhibits the vastly troubled and heartbroken man Charles Xavier was in his past, spending his days mourning over the friends and students he's lost to his now-nemesis, Eric Lehnsherr (Magneto). McAvoy has definitely been one of my favorite actors who's been rising over the years since 2007's Atonement and proving his impressive range, and he's given the perfect role here—even more than First Class—to dig deep into the emotional side of Xavier whose self-esteem and hope for the future of his race truly suffers. Being another favorite of mine, Michael Fassbender once again returns to reprise his role as Magneto, and man, is this rendition of Magneto a profoundly devastating villain—nearly unstoppable and scheming in his behavior. He often disguises his true intentions, mystifying his inner thoughts and making his next plan nearly unpredictable. As we remember, Magneto has accomplished numerous fake-outs throughout the cinematic series from his brief alliance with Xavier in X2 to his apparent innocence once reunited with his old friend, Charles, in this chapter. Unlike the generic villains that pervade Marvel Studios' films, Magneto once again showcases his formidable presence through his terrorizing powers, frequently overpowering everyone else in the room as long as he has his lustrous metallic helmet around. Most powerful of all though is the returning extraordinary dynamic and interaction between these two former friends—Xavier and Magneto—more transparent here than ever before. On a related note, Days of Future Past is pervaded with humanity—that element of genuine human drama that's missing from superhero movies nowadays. It's what I love about First Class and this sequel: they seem so confident in their character- driven narratives rather than feeling the need to insert an intense action sequence between every other tamer scene. There were whole 15- minute scenes purely dedicated to emotion-ridden conversations, fleshing out the character's pasts (Eric's and Charles's especially) and whatnot, generating a prodigious amount of characterization that's all too rare in the genre. With that being said, it's still not the perfect/flawless X-Men film. See, I generally abhor stories about time travel because you essentially know that they're going to tie up the ending as neatly as possible. So, even when characters in the future, past, or present die, you really don't care. You undoubtedly know history will rewrite itself and everyone will survive and the world will be restored to unmitigated peace. That element of unpredictability immediately vanishes, and at that point, the storytellers can bring back dead characters from the series' past and correct any tragedy throughout the entire franchise. It's frankly boring and creatively unfair, but of course, the crowd- pleasing aspect is a mandate in superhero movies at this point. In addition, everyone who's read the comics, and this storyline in particular, has been hyping up the sentinels to be these unforgettable, baleful villains in the X-Men universe. But really, I felt like they weren't anything more than the standard threats of the week that simply came and went. In the end, Days of Future Past, while still leagues behind The Dark Knight's presence of brilliance in the superhero genre, is still far superior to any superhero film in the last three years. While the themes (of segregation/racism and fate vs. choice) aren't anything mind-blowing and subtle, this recent X-Men installment still contains that substance/cinematic value and promises a lot more for its future than the countless flicks Marvel Studios release every year.",7,1,3,24 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A Hobbit to Its Predecessor
","And so, the pack's journey continues- on a quest to rid Middle Earth of the viscous dragon, Smaug. Bilbo Baggins has decided to keep the mysterious, golden ring (or we can just call it 'The One Ring!') and his interest in it begins to develop even further. How much longer can he hold onto this secret and retain the group's trust, especially that of his old friend, Gandalf? The Desolation of Smaug is undoubtedly a more grandiose experience when compared to the trilogy's first installment (An Unexpected Journey). I was actually one of the biggest admirers of the first part, mind you, and discerning the greater praise for this film definitely brought me into a state of larger anticipation for its release. With that being said- and to no surprise- the visual effects remain awe- inspiring. The spectacular production design will fully immerse you in this epic world that Peter Jackson impeccably constructed. You will never, for one second, sense the actuality of the events transpiring on a movie set- everything from the detailed, fantastical forests to the gloriously designed caves, suffused with gold and remarkable architecture. If you find these special moments beautiful to no end, wait until you see the dragon (Smaug) unleash fury and prove his utter formidability in the film's exhilaratingly action-packed and lengthy finale. Like I said, the production value for a movie has never felt more imposing. I also immensely appreciated the thoughtful focus on each individual character as we witness certain dynamics and interesting arcs throughout, involving not only the dwarfs but a satisfying and significant inclusion of favorites like Legolas and enjoyable new additions like the badass beauty, Tauriel, and strong-willed Bard. However, its grandeur only goes so far before you start to notice detrimental flaws the film persistently carries along. First of all, the picture essentially lacks focus as a result of introducing countless characters/villains and extended peripheral scenes between minor characters and situations. There are so many subplots tossed in- considering Jackson's enormous ambition of capturing the entire lore of Tolkien's product- that the main storyline ultimately becomes muddled. Though I applauded the emphasis on numerous characters, the execution comes with a fault, and the characterization is subsequently more transparent than subtle. Then, we have the lackluster script that's pervaded by hackneyed one- liners and overall clichéd dialogue. The screenplay basically attempts to implement the utmost menace into its villains by having them utter the most stereotypical (thus unintimidating) phrases. I honestly have no recollection of a similar issue in An Unexpected Journey, but let's continue, shall we? My next sentiment could be deemed controversial and that of a minority's opinion, but I'll reveal it anyways: I frankly sensed the 3-hour-long duration in this case drastically more than I did with the first entry. A large contributor is the confrontation between Bilbo Baggins and Smaug himself. Their conversation just went on and on, juxtaposing with the troubling events occurring in several other settings and again returning to this ever-prolonged talk. You'd think Smaug would get right to it, but no, his lonesome self apparently receives pleasure from conversing with others. I was also surprised by the absence of a memorable and exciting score when regarding An Unexpected Journey's amazingly gratifying soundtrack ('Far Over the Misty Mountains,' anyone?). The music continued on but never happened to stand out in any of the more thrilling and intense sections. In addition, the plot definitely suffered from a hint of predictability since every situation was so miraculously resolved that any predicament succeeding it lost its potential tension. It'd be important to note the changed tone from the predecessor's; taking the fact that this is not Lord of the Rings into account, I much preferred the lighthearted tone in An Unexpected Journey. There was just a superior amount of fun in that one as opposed to the familiarly darker tone of this follow-up's. At the end of the day, I understand that these criticisms could be seen as, at least, partially subjective, but Desolation of Smaug didn't hype me for next year's continuation the way An Unexpected Journey did.",5,7,15,15 December 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A Perfect Mixture of Maturity and Fun
","At this point, Hollywood has mastered animation, and the craft exemplified here is certainly some of the best I've ever seen—the wonderfully radiant colors, lifelike movements and mannerisms, as well as the utterly photorealistic skin and scenery. How to Train Your Dragon 2 commences with a focus on Toothless' (the dragon) and Hiccup's fully developed relationship and the profusion of dragons now coexisting with the Vikings on the island of Berk. Hiccup's 'alpha-male' father— the king of all Vikings— is still dying to see his son reach the heights of true manliness—a point where he's prepared to rule after his father's reign. On that note, trouble reprises, and the peaceful balance that was finally restored is once again in danger of rifting as an imposing threat, named Drago, who can tame dragons and has already bred a whole army of them, promises to take over everything that was once serene. Over the past five years, I frankly lost hope for animated movies as each one put too much effort into pleasing the clueless children and not the rest of the crowd that's actually there in the movie theater along with the 5-year-old's. Well, after all of these excessively kiddy cartoons (like Frozen and Wreck-It-Ralph), there's finally an animated film with enough maturity and tonal darkness to appease the adults as well. Then again, Dreamworks Animation might just have a better idea than Disney (in its shameful modern state) as to the proper direction of cartoons. You seriously have to appreciate how this picture treats the period of Vikings because it was definitely a perilous and violent time back then. Never shying away from quite adult content (including the large battle sequences), this treat has enough dark moments to depict the mood of the era as accurately as possible for a family movie. For instance, it's especially confident in its storytelling, unafraid of killing off characters unlike modern-day Disney and Pixar. Parents, don't let this predominately grim-sounding description draw you away because make no mistake: there's still plenty for kids to enjoy. In fact, what makes How to Train Your Dragon 2 the best animation in a long time is its perfect blend of humor, seriousness, characterization, and cuteness/warmth. Sufficient screen time is given to each of the major characters for effective development—a display of mastery in shuffling each character's arc and story with ease. The cast features a multitude of popular and talented actors like Gerard Butler, Jonah Hill, Djimon Hounsou, Kristen Wiig, and many more. Don't think for a second that I won't mention Cate Blanchett—I mean, wow, she even dominates voice acting, bringing her utter grace to the screen. Her character is filled with so much emotion and enthusiasm. Matter of fact, having a background in theatre acting allows Blanchett to wholly take advantage of her voice, exuding a humane level of sentiment that helps her transcend what could've simply been a cartoon of a character. In addition, the primary villain of the film (Drago, voiced by Hounsou) is one of the few convincingly evil and menacing villains I've witnessed in a modern animated picture, causing a surprising amount of loss and emanating shrouding tyranny upon a previously-gleeful land. Then—and one of my absolute favorite aspects of the film—we have the amazingly beautiful score by John Powell that honestly sends me back to the days of classical, elegant Disney tales. The music's melody gradually heightens with that sense of grandeur and adventure that's greatly befitting when considering the movie's setting. Moreover, as opposed to most contemporary animations, this one's themes actually aren't cheesy and clichéd. Instead, HTTYD 2 promotes highly relevant messages of peace and the crucial need to keep one's composure and tranquility in the face of frustrating and hopeless situations. That not only makes for a fresher approach but surely resonates with everyone in the audience in comparison to the overdone preaching of the significance that is friendship and teamwork elsewhere. Unfortunately, I feel like Dreamworks Animation is often overlooked and underrated when in reality, they have produced a plethora of thoroughly enjoyable pictures (see: Shrek, The Road to El Dorado, Sinbad, Flushed Away, The Prince of Egypt, Antz, etc.). The studio seems much more aware that both adults and adolescents are viewing their productions, and thus, they seek to mix maturity with playfulness in order to satisfy both demographics. Shrek also accomplished that goal magnificently by including both adult-oriented humor and subject matter along with the more family-friendly kind. All in all, the HTTYD sequel is a fun journey with enough authenticity to avoid the overly kiddy tone most modern cartoons set for themselves. After repeatedly stating that it's the best animation in years, I really can't make it anymore obvious how much I recommend the watch.",9,7,14,18 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Beautiful Sight of Adventure
","Admittedly, I've never been the biggest fan of Wes Anderson's work. Amidst the hype that encompassed every one of his releases, I just couldn't get behind the quirkiness and bizarre sense of humor largely present therein. Back in 2012, I was hoping that Moonrise Kingdom might be the film to win me over, but that unfortunately wasn't the case. However, The Grand Budapest Hotel might well be. First off, Ralph Fiennes might've given one of his career's best performances here, portraying a remarkable, amiable concierge that builds a friendship with the new lobby boy at the hotel as a wild journey ensues from there on. Fiennes manages to carry a fine amount of charisma throughout and perfectly fits into Anderson's type of zany world. Another notable showing is Adrien Brody's convincing role as the scheming villain; he's back in full form here, ladies and gentlemen, as he fully encapsulates obnoxiousness and menace at once. Now, my favorite part of The Grand Budapest Hotel (as with any other Anderson film) was the brilliant, breathtaking production design, and wow, is it one of the best and visually stunning production designs to a film I've ever seen (no exaggeration here, folks)—gorgeously colorful and as charming as can be. While the plot thickens, its viewers take a ride through multitudinous settings all with vastly disparate scenery (whether it be snowy, sullen, or vibrant). Moreover, the film also benefits from exceptionally thoughtful shot composition, leaving you in wonder of how the look—including the visuals—was even pulled off. The cinematography is spectacular, guiding you through surrealist and visually magical locations. Herein, the camera serves as an extremely clever device to beautifully and punctiliously maneuver through Anderson's fastest-paced film yet (lacking the slightest hint of dullness), acting as another intricate element in the story's development. As a result of these meticulously-implemented components (undoubtedly award-worthy costume design, set design, make-up, and the whole bunch), the atmosphere created is absolutely wonderful and a complete joy to be a part of, which is rare for many films and, personally, even rarer for me when it comes to Anderson's films even as graphically enticing as they can be. As I've repeatedly already noted how far removed I am from an Anderson fan, I'm certainly not the only one since these films obviously aim for a niche audience and are definitely not for everyone. Nonetheless, The Grand Budapest Hotel is palpably the most accessible film from his filmography seeing how he presents us with a surely entertaining comedic mystery that glides along thrillingly—bountifully fueled with adventure— thanks in large part to its swifter editing style. In spite of that, it could still be a very peculiar film that's also targeted towards a more specific audience simply owing to the fact that everything from the characters to the events are immensely over-the-top and seemingly cartoonish in typical Anderson fashion. Although, the picture presents its outlandish content with such confidence that some of the more illogical and nonsensical activities that would otherwise harm a standard film aren't even remotely distracting here due to the smart introduction and build-up on a unique tone from the very start. In comparison to the film's majestic appearance, the story, itself, isn't as memorable or stimulating as its overall technical design, but it can still be fairly humorous at times, wittily utilizing many well- known and beloved actors in cameos or more significant roles to excellent comedic effect. In the end, Anderson's latest provides enough warmth, thrills, and beauteous mis-en-scène to allure the most casual of moviegoers, thankfully not relying as much on self-indulgence and narrow, discrete humor as his other films.",8,0,7,13 April 2014
Foxcatcher," The Battle of Ego, Power, and Wealth
","After the gripping character studies and intelligent social commentaries that Bennett Miller has become such a master of, there's no better filmmaker to tackle this shocking true story—a tragedy about people who ambitiously chased the American Dream and actually fell for its seduction. Coming off of a championship win, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is near the top of Olympic wrestling but lacks the proper wit, ambition, and strategy to further himself until he is fatefully invited to meet John du Pont (Steve Carell), a member of the most famous and wealthy dynasty in the country, who instills him with athletic fury, drive, and infectious motivational philosophy. Mark truly wants to be the best in the world, but his lacking astuteness has now led him away from his fatherly and encouraging brother, Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo)—a respected coach and wrestler who Mark enviously realizes is a whole level above him—and into the psychologically unpredictable hands of a creepily uncanny, eccentric stranger who he admittedly hasn't even heard of. With the help of absolutely convincing make-up that shapes the noticeably wicked/large nose and eerie teeth, Carell delivers a powerfully haunting performance as a socially isolated and awkward man, raised in an out-of-touch environment all his life, who is struggling with numerous egoistic and trust issues that endlessly vex him from within. However, this is also Tatum's show as we follow the rise of this naïve meathead (how can I more politely describe him?) who is clearly vulnerable to being essentially puppeteered by exploitive, power-hungry men. It's worth to point out just how Tatum's childlike, innocent personality here infuses us with total pity for his character while Ruffalo's usual warmth makes us sympathize as well. In fact, Ruffalo's performance is most subtle of all; he's obviously not as flamboyant as the other two and is instead relied on to reflect a certain human quality in an otherwise utterly cold picture. Dave Schultz is a big brother who's undoubtedly talented in the sport, but unlike the other two, his pride doesn't get the better of him since he continually seeks to improve his brother on that path to fame and success as well. Here is where it gets worryingly complicated though because these three personalities develop a paranoid, unreliable dynamic that sees each other vie for that ultimate glory. Foxcatcher thoroughly utilizes the sport of wrestling as not only a point of critique but also as a stark metaphor for this dangerous power struggle between complex individuals behind the scenes. There's no better feeling than being called a winner—being recognized as a man who achieved tremendous victory and success. The fierce competitiveness and the frequent sense of disappointing failure that is so inherent in the very essence of sports has produced an abundance of psychologically and ideologically conflicted, twisted men that are battling with intolerable arrogance and blindness. In the case of John du Pont, the feeling of invalidation and complete disrespect beleaguers him through his days, including the sharp disapproval from his own mother (Vanessa Redgrave) who only views wrestling—her son's sole passion—as a lowly sport. As he witnesses the admiration people express towards the actually capable coaches like Dave and the brawny athletes like Mark, he's sort of put in between—in a position where people recognize him as that one lucky, wealthy son of a gun but nothing more. Through the use of deliberately-timed editing, the constant grapple of jealousy—the lingering sense of betrayal; the sense of unrelenting determination to shine above the others and escape each other's shadows —between these three is realized. The film also paces itself so slowly with countless scenes of dead silence and the absence of a score that would've just easily manipulated our impressions of the people on- screen. It's almost as if Foxcatcher intends to remain as cold and distant from its subjects as possible. Perhaps—gasp—it means to take a more objective perspective of its protagonists (unlike most biopics in recent memory) and allow the final consequences to make its ultimate point. From scene to scene, we witness the amusing awkwardness of du Pont in the wildly slow intonations and recurrent pauses of his speech. In fact, seeing du Pont's erratic behavior and the uncomfortable homoerotic undertones throughout, there's a hilarious black comedy lingering beneath the surface, to the most deceptive extent where laughter seems wholly out of place once you recognize the sheer bleakness of this material. The history of his childhood—of his fortunate birth into and the inheritance from an insanely rich family, is incredibly fascinating. He was born into money without a single clue how to best use it or what to really do with himself. Most of all, what I most admire about Foxcatcher is the perfectly uncompromising, dark direction that Miller takes with this tale. The exceptional cinematography makes sure to emphasize the arrant somberness of the fog that encompasses its characters as the chilliness of a colder winter closes in. There's no tenderness to please mass audiences with here; there's only brutal honesty. Using the frustration with the typical cop-out approaches most biopics take nowadays by becoming a little too close to their subjects and portraying them as completely perfect specimens (hello, The Theory of Everything), Foxcatcher never gets scared away from showing just how flawed and disturbed its characters really are—how frightening and enigmatic the mind of a real human being can eventually become. The film takes the advice of du Pont in absolutely exhibiting its confidence and never backing down from depicting tragedy and human nature at its worst. Now, excuse me: I'm going to go read up some more on these peculiar people and the system that brought them together.",10,8,14,18 January 2015
Gone Girl," A Haunting Look At Marriage and Media Culture
","It's a scary world out there. We see it through three-second snippets of a serene neighborhood in Missouri as each credit quickly fades with every shot. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) calmly exits his house and takes a trip to the bar he co-owns. After a dispirited talk with his twin sister, Margo (Carrie Coon), revealing how frankly exhausted he is from his wife's personality, Nick returns home to find his wife missing and the glass coffee table shattered. In between the present scenes when we see Nick publicly transform from a sympathized husband in the media to an abhorred one—suspected of cold murder—the story introduces us to Amy (Rosamund Pike). Pike's Amy Dunne immediately has our support and understanding—a wife of unimaginable, elegant beauty. She's intelligent and classy, carrying a fond taste for the sophisticated—the arts. What makes her even more mesmerizing is the fact that these types of rich female characters are a saddening rarity. Oftentimes, actresses are reserved for the tired role of a ditsy romantic interest that has absolutely no self-purpose or motivation. Right from the start, Amy makes us fall in love with her; the amount of dignity, (admittedly) inner arrogance, and wit she possesses is particularly refreshing. She narrates her sentiments through a daily diary, tracing her marriage's evolution from the 'lovey-dovey' stage to the inevitable phase of irritation five years later.Suddenly, the marriage has taken a turn for the worst. Goosebumps start to form on my arms as I clutch the jacket on my lap harder. Nick begins to display a frightening temper as Amy becomes concerned with their future (and eventually her life) in this loveless and fading marriage that has taken form. Everything about her—her delicate skin, the heartbreaking look in her eyes, her perpetual state of fear—reveals Amy's true vulnerability, which makes me that much more concerned for her as well. What have you done, Nick? The media circus is outside his house every day of the week—incessantly flashing cameras and begging for interviews. The hot media frenzy has found a new victim in this tragic couple. A haunting score in its creepy mellowness— occasional rhythmically blood-pumping with the resounding bass, and sometimes purely heartrending—from frequent David Fincher collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, adds that final stamp to Fincher's staple atmosphere-setting.Affleck gives a surprisingly impressive performance (as well as unsurprising since Fincher always gets the absolute best out of his actors whether or not the audience is skeptical about them going in— Jesse Eisenberg and Rooney Mara are perfect examples). He has a manner of innocence and ostensible normality about him (unlike the typical characteristics of a psychopath, he's not meticulous or perfectly composed) but yet keeps us doubting as he continually makes the wrong decisions.Moreover, the way this film is edited amazes me—it enthralls you and somehow creates a slow-burn of a thriller with terrific pacing. The juxtaposition between the characters' current activities as a sequence anxiously unravels is astonishing and consequently creates sheer suspense and many gasps from the audience. The two-and-a-half-hour runtime is essential in regards to the exceptional character development/characterization, which ceaselessly continues to contradict our impressions of and sympathies for its characters.Not only does Fincher's latest masterpiece paint a bleak portrait of marriage—the constant denial of your relationship's issues, the expectations of standard marriage and the notion of living up to that— but also showcases the disheartening, malign, and corrupt nature of our media culture. Every individual can live or die based on public perception—one's portrayal on the usually sensationalized, exaggerated outlet that composes the news stations and interview sessions. Unfortunately, society impatiently jumps to conclusions, logically flawed/irrational as they are, expecting the black-and-white dramatics of a fictional narrative.Gone Girl is unrelentingly complex when it comes down to its meaty characters, topical dark subject matter, and overall plot. Its utter brilliance is also proved by the fact that it will undoubtedly stir lengthy conversations. Following the unforgettably terrifying and audacious climax—especially the very final shot—I stay in my seat, not moving an inch, as the credits roll. The packed theater is also unusually still and silent for those brief seconds. There have been few times when I was this eager to have a full spoiler discussion—when I had this much of a craving to go in for a second viewing.",10,12,28,5 October 2014
Mr. Nobody," An Ambitious Film That Succeeds?
","One of the many reasons I attend the movie theater so frequently is to experience what I haven't before and to live through incredibly fresh and memorable journeys as to excitedly recall them in future discussions on cinema. Personally, the greatest cinematic events are remembered due to their remarkably daring approach in one way or another, reluctant to pursue the same old subject matter that appeals to critics and the Academy year in and year out. In that regard, Mr. Nobody is a risk if there ever was any and its ambition, for being such a small independent production, is vastly impressive! In fact, Mr. Nobody holds several similarities with last year's Cloud Atlas in that they explore the concept of decision-making in a massive universe that never calls attention to a being as miniscule as you and I. This film embarks on a study of extremely thought-provoking metaphysics and humanity's very existence in a wholly random and gigantic system of events. Nemo Nobody is an adolescent who is forced to choose between his father and mother, following their unfortunate separation, one leaving on a train to a distant land and the other watching the memory fade in dismay; Nemo is in the center and whomever he chooses will substantially affect his future- the people he will end up meeting, the locations he will end up visiting, and the condition in which he will find himself as time speedily advances. From that moment on, this extraordinarily peculiar narrative will cast us into these infinite possibilities to which Nemo may one day expose himself, based on the decision he will ultimately make on that fateful day. Vastly differential lives will be led and various love interests will follow under separate destinies- its tagline: 'If you never make a choice, anything is possible.' This feature is essentially an exemplar of the truly bizarre adventures one might take on a trip to the cinema as you are left completely befuddled on the path to the movie's conclusion while numerous situations transpire and the familiar meet their ends. The editing and visual style exemplified in this picture is simply amazing and is definitely what drives the foundations of such a creative film. You will find yourself astonished by the dozens of clever techniques employed by the cinematography. Again, returning to my initial point, Mr. Nobody is one of those movies you absolutely can't judge in a definitive manner until you reach the credits as the thematic material and substance, overall, decently materializes by its endpoint, testing the moviegoer's patience on its gradual climb to satisfying explanation. Once you've hit the final mark, the confusion that once bothered you somewhat clears and you finally feel like this story was worth your 2+ hours of attention. Drawing parallels to Cloud Atlas, it, too, audaciously attempts to convey a challenging, extensive tale that tours the fascinating nature in which our lives unravel and how one small decision leaves us with an utterly disparate environment. As with Cloud Atlas, what undoubtedly keeps us in our seats instead of barging out of the showing in frustration, are the stunning visuals and the colossal scope partaken. In addition, Mr. Nobody carries a fun soundtrack throughout with the likes of 'Mister Sandman' and 'Where is my Mind' that effectively assists the pacing and entertainment factor within a particular scene. Though one can overwhelmingly praise this marvel, another can gripe over how pretentious it seemed; it certainly isn't for everyone. I can appreciate its confidence, but it might not resonate with as many people as it had hoped considering its bloated content, executed in rather vague fashion.",7,1,2,30 November 2013
The Theory of Everything," An (Ironically) Uninspired Effort
","Despite not being a total genius like Stephen Hawking, everyone should take pleasure in living during a time when they have their own Einstein or Edison. The Theory of Everything tells the tragic, yet inspiring, story of Hawking from his youthful Cambridge years to the miserable deterioration of his body through the following decades by ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). A brilliant mind, this man has birthed a totally new path for quantum theory/mechanics that is so crucial to our understanding of the universe—his ceaseless search for the answers or just that single convenient explanation of what this largely enigmatic world truly is and how it came to be. Are the answers simply derived from our perceptions of time and space? There's no denying that Hawking is an ingenious and fairly eccentric individual, but does his life exactly warrant another Oscar bait of a biopic? Or rather, does it translate well?Well, without even any attempt at establishing an authentic and aesthetically distinct atmosphere, The Theory of Everything rushes us right into the romance as soon as it commences. Main character attends a crowded party with his more enthusiastic friend. He sights a beautiful girl. Girl, out of miraculous coincidence, notices him with a fancy as well and learns his name. Boom, they meet there and then. Storytelling can't get any lazier and more formulaic than that. Moreover, that concisely introduces us to the tone and style the rest of the film will assume. The screenplay is simplistically boiled down to please crowds with every inspirational platitude and heartwarming comment. As a deliberate tearjerker through and through, it will oftentimes slip in a brief humorous exchange of dialogue to calm the weepers down. Fundamentally, the script is highly predictable in its structure and manner—something you would expect a traditional mindset to adore, which includes the Academy. Bless its heart, the film is so naïve and overly optimistic that its complementary visual appearance/cinematography turns out so bright and unremarkable that might suit it more for a BBC show. This is exactly the result I expected from another entry in the period piece/biographic genre that follows an extraordinary human being but tries too hard to make him sympathetic and relatable to audiences. We witness a very saintly portrait of Stephen Hawking—never losing temper or making moral mistakes. Even when touching on the more controversial aspects of Hawking's beliefs like his attitude towards religion and the 'Creator,' the picture executes this all in a way that appeases everyone once again and sweeps any atheistic ideas under the rug quickly, surely believing that such material might prove to be too condescending or alienating for its viewers. On the other hand, the majestically melodic score by Jóhann Jóhannsson remains one of the film's greatest elements, but the sheer exhibition of acting talent here is definitely what takes the spotlight. Of course, there's the showy, but very effective, performance from Eddie Redmayne, which is juxtaposed with a much more subtle and nuanced performance from Felicity Jones who wears the mien of utter exhaustion and deep concern with her throughout a depressing, albeit very admirable and encouraging, life that's spent nurturing her 'companion.' It's these two wonderful performances that provoke wild emotion from moviegoers and essentially take the movie beyond the level of generic fodder that it occasionally comes frighteningly close to. At the end of the day, if you're one to allow sentimentality to take over and thus excuse a transparent lack of inspired, brave artistry, then The Theory of Everything might very well win you over. Otherwise, this is the kind of film that might possibly be included in numerous discussions during awards season and then placed into the group of forgettable made-for-Oscars biopics a year later.",6,6,11,29 November 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Walter Mitty's Inconsistent, Yet Beautiful, Journey
","I mean, c'mon, who hasn't daydreamed about a more exciting life in which the girl of your dreams is now suddenly in your arms. Something The Secret Life of Walter Mitty surely promises is empathy. Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is a 'negative assets manager' over at Life Magazine who spends most of his day in his thoughts rather than in reality, and a fellow employee (Kristen Wiig) he works with has certainly caught his eye. Consequently, he contemplates, zones out, and pleasurably imagines heroically and properly introducing himself to her- true romance commencing from thereon. However, once someone taps him back to life and he wakes up, Mitty can only approach his crush with deepening awkwardness and nervosity. Sad is the truth, but when can we finally stop dreaming of a more invigorating and interesting version of our life and embark on that exhilarating journey we so clearly desire? The film hopes to explore that question as Walter Mitty travels across the world to locate a missing negative, and from that point forward, he finally encounters the danger, energy, and pure vastness of the real world. A major highlight of this ambitious project is its downright gorgeous visuals, taking us to the open spaces of Iceland, the grandiose Himalaya Mountains, and the dark depths of an ocean. The camera places you into some frenetic action sequences and then counters these with beautiful establishing shots of various landscapes, representing the expansive terrains of the sheer life out there, patiently waiting for us whether you're a middle-aged, distressed white-collar worker or an intrepid young adult. The editing is smooth and remarkably prevalent, playing a significant role in conveying this inspiring narrative. The soundtrack complements that sense of excitement and adventure, providing us with lively tracks from the likes of Arcade Fire and encouraging ones from artists like Of Monsters and Men. Now, the first half of the film is driven by that level of realism, relatability, and quirkiness, which I found to be very satisfying indeed. With that being said, the second half takes on a cheesier and less believable tone/path, obviously attempting to accomplish its thematic goals. Hollywood's involvement becomes perfectly transparent once the film reaches the last act, and that happy ending becomes ever happier (and unnatural). In addition, a movie that's partially fueled by comedy unfortunately doesn't deliver on enough laughs. It got a few chuckles out of me, but a considerable portion of the jokes/overall humor fell flat and simply appeared clumsy in delivery. In essence, TSLOWM works much better as a drama than a comedy (with dramatic elements). So, if you are to enter the theater with the expectations of it being a drama, you'd likely end up leaving more satisfied rather than if you entered it thinking it's another fun, inspiring comedy for the holidays. At the end of the day, if you just can't bring yourself to enjoy Walter Mitty's (inconsistent) story throughout the entire duration, chances are you still might be mesmerized by its dazzling look and spectacular production value. Regardless of its predictable and slightly corny conclusion, there is much motivation and zeal to be found in this uplifting, inspiriting tale.",6,1,4,26 December 2013
22 Jump Street," A Roller-coaster Ride of Comedy
","21 Jump Street was a huge surprise of a hit back in 2012, and of course— in this day and age—that means a sequel is on its way. Thankfully, Phil Lord and Chris Miller have returned to the project because it could've otherwise been a total mess. The thing is that Lord and Miller are probably the most ingenuous filmmakers working in the comedy genre right now, always taking the 'meta' approach to their films as can be seen by this year's earlier release, The Lego Movie, and now this—a rare example of an outstanding sequel. Don't get me wrong; if this was a sequel that simply continued Jonah Hill's and Channing Tatum's relationship in another elaborate but more exciting undercover operation, I would've had a hard time seeing how it'd succeed. However, in this case, everyone is fully aware of the 'cash-grab, unnecessary sequel' status that's immediately imposed upon the film, and so what do they do? They ride with it. The most famous exemplar in the conversation is the Hangover series, which has been completely lambasted to the point of utter mortification for all those involved. I feel like those two sequels were the butt of the jokes here. In addition, 22 Jump Street goes one step ahead, says 'why not?' and continually parodies the numerous tropes that plague buddy-cop movies and any kind of genre. The dialogue is consistently witty, poking fun at the sheer superficiality of the college environment instead of adopting the douchiness of other college comedies. Obviously—I would say—the most important element of this film has to be the chemistry between Hill and Tatum, which is frankly organic at this point. Both characters feed off of each other, bringing their own vastly differential personalities and style to the table. That is exactly what makes the best of buddy comedies, and what makes the Jump Street series so charming is the sweet 'brolationship' between the nerd and jock. Here, it's delivered to amazing comedic effect, sentimentally playing around with their relationship as if it was a romantic one (essentially, the joke is on the idea of 'bros for life'). I've said it once and I'll say it again: I have been really impressed with Channing Tatum as of late. He could've come out be a generic and bland pretty boy who starred in the banal action flicks or simpleminded rom-com's—he has done a fair share of those in the past, yes, but his evolution as an actor is quite evident. Tatum's a very smart individual, choosing to display his absolute versatility and range by taking on various genres (proving his comedy chops in one film, giving dramatic weight in another, and then from time to time, taking the fun action movies). Speaking of, I'm really looking forward to seeing his talent shine again in Foxcatcher later this year. With all that being said, there's one comment to make on this atrocious trend that's been persisting with showing way too much in trailers. This film is immensely guilty of that as well. I still can't believe they had the guts to reveal the true culprit behind the mysterious criminal scheme in the darn trailer. They show a 20-second clip from one of the last scenes in the movie! Whose idea was that, really? The narrative would've been far better if the viewer didn't—you know—expect the twist; I definitely have to discredit this film for that if anything. On another note, even though the likability of Channing Tatum's more hapless and relatable character in the first one transforms into mere obnoxiousness as he joins the frat boys and accepts his persona as the muscular, good-looking jock, the goodhearted nature of the two's dynamic still survives at the end of the day. Once it's been evaluated, 22 Jump Street is certainly one of the most inventive and exceptional comedy sequels out there, continuing the story while making fun of it. Oh, and wait until you see the end credits sequence that fully trashes the whole idea of a (once-fresh) concept repeating itself exactly throughout an entire series.",8,3,8,18 June 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," This Rebooted Franchise Just Gets Hammier As It Goes
","Frankly, watching the new Spider-Man movies made me miss Sam Raimi's original trilogy that much more—yes, even Spider-Man 3 (actually not even a hater of that movie like most people on the 'cool' or comic-book train). This rebooted series has plenty of flaws and is markedly lacking in so many aspects that it often gets awkward and groan- inducing, including Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker. I preferred Tobey Maguire's Parker simply because he was much more relatable, sympathetic, likable—you know? This one is a cocky lady-charmer with a slew of cheesy jokes. Nope, as far as I know about the original Peter Parker from the comics, he was always a geek who eventually donned the bright outfit and took on the role as a 'friendly neighborhood' and hero. We are far removed from that image with Marc Webb's rendition. Personally, though, it's definitely more fun to write a negative review than a positive one (I feel like there's so much more things to say) so the film did give me that pleasure. Ouch! Anyway, the mystery behind the sudden disappearance/deaths of Parker's parents continues from the first installment, and we're actually presented with much more depth into the arc this time around. In addition, Peter Parker is still attempting to somehow address Gwen Stacy's and his relationship after the death of her father and the promise he made Parker keep. Lots of drama already, and then—boom—a plethora of villains because we obviously didn't have enough story to cover. First, we get Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) who actually benefits from an intriguing set-up/origin story as a nerdy, awkward Spider-Man fanatic; that was fun. However, once we witness his transition into his villainous role as Electro, things start to get hammy and ridiculous with never the slightest hint of believability or proper development. There's never a scene that explains how he suddenly turned from a shy, humble Oscorp employee into a menacing, destructive baddie. 'I AM ELECTRO!' Yes, he actually said that in the movieIn a significantly smaller part, Paul Giamatti horribly portrays the rhino, and yes, he too laughably exclaims 'I am the Rhino!' at one point in the film, as well as carries a terrible Russian accent (I guess that's apparently what that babble/gibberish was supposed to be). Cringe- worthy, I know! Just like the rest of the flick's dialogue. And finally, we have Peter's dear friend, Harry Osborn, who of course turns into the Green Goblin, and actually, in comparison to the rest of the 'super-evil' characters, he was fine. Now, Dane DeHaan, for some reason, thought that putting on a forced, deep and maniacal-like voice was going to sound convincing or make him sound more like a typical teenagerit didn't work. Usually, I'm a huge fan of DeHaan's work (from Chronicle to Kill Your Darlings), but this performance really disappointed, and like the rest of the film, was quite over-the-top. Most importantly and what I briefly mentioned above, the dialogue just can't be taken seriously. The conversations frequently make you cringe as far down as you can get into your seat, and the actors clearly think that stumbling with your lines and repeating the same word makes for fine acting. In essence, almost everything in this film feels forced and unnatural, and I don't know if Webb was going for a truly comic-booky superhero movie. If so, it really worked but not in a good way. The film is so confident that it abandons any sense of being grounded and just goes all out. Screw logic and have this guy burst with electricity, and yup, he gets even more powerful with the more electricity he consumes. If you're a comic- book fanboy, you might be biased into not minding these sorts of elements, but as a pure fan of films, it honestly was difficult to stomach. Shall we get to the movie's soundtrack too? You know it's a 2014 Spider-Man movie when you hear dubstep and hip electronic music playing in the background. Did we see any of that in the original trilogy? No because it wasn't necessary, and it also wasn't popular back then. Moreover, there's a scene that unnecessarily begins playing a pop/country song that makes it feel more like a music video than an authentically-edited search for information on his dad's death. Last but not least, in comparison to the original films, The Amazing Spider- Man 2 is undoubtedly geared towards younger audiences with its inclusion of extremely kiddy humor that only saw laughter from—who else?—the little kids in the movie theater. I thought Spider-Man was excessive with his use of jokes but, at least, witty ones. So, I practically drove everything this movie offered into the ground with this review, but don't get mad at me yet, Spider-Man fans, because— at least—the movie gained from the chemistry Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone share on-screen as the couple. On another note, the filmmakers actually pulled off a considerable risk towards the end by—*gasp*— killing off a character (like they did with its predecessor), which is certainly more than Marvel Studios could ever do with their properties in their magical worlds of miraculous revivals and recoveries. Furthermore, we do get some exciting action sequences and thankfully, Spider-Man faces off against his threatening foes a few times throughout the narrative instead of just an immediate final showdown that an abundance of similar movies mistakenly feature. In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't the worst of superhero movies. Actually, it's a little better than its forerunner and even more enjoyable than some of Marvel's recent films, but when compared to the classic superhero movies that Sam Raimi graced onto screens, the X- Men franchise, and—duh—Nolan's Batman films, this new Spider-Man story hardly warrants the franchise's quick resurrection.",3,15,32,3 May 2014
Children of Men," A Rare Accomplishment in Film
","Though I have already seen Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men prior to Thursday's viewing, I came to the realization that to truly appreciate the film's level of depth requires one to witness the picture multiple times and more. Before digging deep into the bowels of its impeccable technical aspect, I can't help but applaud the movie's fresh concept and setting where it presents a bleak and depressing future in which fertility is basically nonexistent assumingly due to humanity's irresponsible behavior towards the earth and our pursuit of self- interests. Clearly, the air lacks any pureness or freshness, and thus, it leaves us in a dystopian environment. There is absolutely nothing joyful in the film's content as you're forced to view sheer misery, hopelessness, and suffering. The world will never be the same, but the script occasionally allows for little humorous bits as if to indicate that happiness is still possible, and that some form of hope, whether miniscule or large, still remains where a smile can yet be sighted on a poor man's face. Now, let's delve into the cinematography and mis-en-scene, specifically. One of the film's well-known and incredibly impressive traits is its use of unusually lengthy shots, and in a way, such a feat definitely revolutionized the way filmmakers shoot. Normally, film stock wouldn't allow for such duration, but even then, to film that long of a shot is unbelievably difficult, especially the way Cuaron engages it. For instance, there's a scene where we see the car (holding Theo, Luke, Julian, Joy, and Mirriam) proceeding through the woods and awaiting potential conflict as a burning car blockades their escape. Remarkably, that entire scene acts as one single shot, and a tamer film could use such extended shots in a much easier manner, but the greatest factor which makes this long-lasting shot/scene so amazing is the amount of events that transpire during its span: you see hundreds of people running towards their position, a burning car sliding down the hill, a motorcycle's spinning out of control, two cops being eliminated, and an important character unfortunately meeting a brutal death. In another scene, I marveled, scratched my head, and wondered how they could possibly pull off a whole graphic pregnancy scene in one single shot, descriptively capturing the baby's birth with the umbilical cord still connected and the baby covered in vernix and fluid. Were substantial CGI effects used- was the baby digitally recreated? In regards to the mis-en-scene, the amount of effort extinguished into creating this disconsolate world is simply astonishing to an observant moviegoer; the filmmakers made sure to dirty up every corner and subtly mask every detail with a gloomy appearance. As a whole in its look and thematic material, the project is unquestionably ambitious and determined. On another significant note, Cuaron and his colleagues showcase extraordinary attention to detail in the film's subtlety when pertaining to the plot, themes, and overall progression. Green seems to be a recurring color throughout in a world otherwise infested with complete darkness or grayness (depends on the way you look at it), and in the world of literature, the color green represents hope, life, fertility, etc, and with that, every glance at a fresh tree or flowers reconstitutes hope and that potentiality of new life in a distant future. Also, the film is seemingly riddled with biblical references. Theo starts his perilous journey as just a normal citizen being cast into a predicament, and there's a scene midway where Theo decides to supply his feet with sandals. The filmmakers could've written the scene so that Theo luckily discovers some standard sneakers or other footwear, but they go along with sandals. Immediately, this brings upon some religious imagery when recalling Jesus Christ's famous footwear. Before Theo comfortably fits the sandals for his feet, he noticeably sighs as if to give the impression that he's not prepared- in the slightest- for the journey he's about to embark on, but at that moment, he has no choice but to undertake a Christ-like path. And then at the very end, his death acts as a sacrifice for the hope of new life and happiness, again reestablishing Christian symbolism. With all that being said, Children of Men is doubtlessly a rare accomplishment in film- one that will continuously be studied down the line and hopefully become a classic that we revisit over and over again, uncovering something additional every time.",9,2,3,7 October 2013
Big Hero 6," Disney's Latest Gorgeous, Yet Formulaic, Offering
","Despite any dissatisfaction I generally have with Disney's recent stream of films, they always deliver in the visuals department. There's no doubt that Big Hero 6 is absolutely visually beautiful, further pushing the boundaries of realistic animation. Everything from the subtle muscle movements to the utter skin complexion is ever more impressive. The vibrant colors of rainbow variety and the stunning attention to the setting's many details surely represent Disney's masterful technique and way of extravagance in animation. The movie opens up with an intriguing first thirty minutes that exposes the audience to a fascinating world of battling mini-bots and a genius 13-year-old kid who gets accepted into a prestigious science university —a white kid with a Japanese name, for whatever reason. Well, actually, this totally fictional city is part of an apparently hybrid world that blends Tokyo with San Francisco—a world that's never explained in the story but only clarified by the filmmakers themselves. Anyway, Hiro (Ryan Potter) shares a very intimate and encouraging friendship with his older brother, Tadashi (Daniel Henney)—two brothers perfectly getting along in a Hollywood picture. Who knew that archetypes don't always have to play a part in these stories? Tidashi is another talented scientific mind who has created a personal healthcare assistant in the form of an intelligent, useful marshmallow- like robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit). It's only later that some very exceptional code programs this innocently-designed robot to suddenly transform into a 'superhero.' As a matter of fact, Big Hero 6 does an outstanding job with character development—an outstanding job in properly fleshing out its multitudinous fun characters, especially in regards to turning Baymax into the sympathetic pet of the year and also giving life to a group of 'nerdy' college kids who befriend Hiro along the way (all with their own distinct personalities, including T.J. Miller's usual dude-bro goofiness). Most of all, the story prioritizes the heartwarming dynamic between the kid in need of assistance, Hiro, and his new compassionate pet robot, Baymax. With all that being said, the story is largely formulaic and unoriginal as we've come to expect from Disney's recent crop of storytelling. A checklist is practically floating around, checking itself off with every emotionally manipulative moment and primitive, predictable turn. 'Okay, now smile; now laugh; now tear up; and now smile again!' The ending is also very deceivingly sad and ultimately misleading...not unlike what Disney has done with every one of their endings as of late, including the Marvel ones. Either stick with your route or go with an alternative one instead. By now, it's become already apparent: gone are the mature, creative days of Pixar who consistently found a way to appeal both to adults and children, or even classic Disney who still had their inspired, magical tales to tell. Nowadays, you have predominantly juvenile comedy—solely consisting of body humor and outdated quips—that always gets the naively-minded mom and her exuberant child laughing off their seats. One can argue that Disney still makes entertaining pictures, but no way will I ever understand any adult that considers their animated work particularly humorous (like, say, the actually hilarious animated films we used to receive in Shrek or The Emperor's New Groove—I honestly think DreamWorks Animation just has a sharper sense of humor).",6,5,21,19 November 2014
The Imitation Game," A Worthy Celebration of Geniuses
","The secrets behind the true victors of World War II were only divulged not too long ago (interestingly enough, it's hard to come by the exact date of the reveal). This tale is about Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who went on to break the Nazis' enigma code and help win the war. Now, there's always that one Oscar-bait film every year that I like much more than I expected. Unlike the rubbish biopics like The Theory of Everything, The Imitation Game actually celebrates the genius. It doesn't try to sentimentally conclude that there's a genius in everyone (because there's frankly not)—not another inspiring story about how everyone can achieve monumental achievements just like Stephen Hawking and Alan Turing. It was very clear from the beginning that Turing wasn't 'normal'—that he deviated from other people for a reason. Normality usually never ends with a tremendous legacy; it's the people who were ignored or unappreciated during their lifetime—the people who were condemned; the people who really didn't care about expectations and general rules—that eventually reach glory. In this case, it takes fifty years for Turing's vast accomplishments to finally be disclosed to the public—let the countless biographic novels and films about him now come. Benedict Cumberbatch's sheer charisma never appears to end as he, once again, encapsulates another sort of personality—the socially inept loner whose solely logical mind and utter arrogance centers on one goal, one total passion of his: the sizable computing machine he's building to crack the impossibly indecipherable German messages. (Keep in mind I've never seen the Sherlock series; so, I'm totally new to this refreshing side of Cumberbatch after seeing him portray a frighteningly menacing villain in last year's Star Trek sequel.) This might sound like typical Oscar-bait material, but it sometimes also largely depends on the particular film's execution. Take 2010's The King's Speech, for instance; what could've easily been another Oscar- checklisting inspirational narrative ended up transcending its material with absolutely believable and natural characters and performances that suck you in beyond any failures in the story's quality and lack of inventiveness. Again, unlike The Theory of Everything (which I have a feeling I'll be knocking down more and more as this review proceeds), we don't hear a lot of that soapy, Lifetime music that shadows the emotional moments. Alexandre Desplat's score here is incredibly emotional without the help of some manipulative, weeping piano notes. The music takes more of the tone of a grand, majestic story, or occasionally perhaps something that makes it feel more like a spy thriller rather than a standard soap opera. Another admirable trait of the film that further defied my expectations was the integrity that stayed with Turing's character to the bitter end; he never loses his conceit or eccentric personality. That clichéd Hollywood arc of character development (the distant bigot suddenly becomes a compassionate benefactor a la Dallas Buyer's Club) thankfully can't be found here. Right from the get-go, Graham Moore's impeccably sharp screenplay wastes no time in shaping these characters, especially Turing, himself, who's given a few humorous scenes to profoundly introduce himself to the audience. Kiera Knightley plays opposite Cumberbatch as an intelligent, dignified woman in the midst of a male- concentrated environment in a male-dominated time period. The dynamic between Cumberbatch and Knightley's Joan Clarke is sweet and amusing; there's no need for a traditional romantic interest/shallow plot line since this relationship is strictly platonic (and Turing, of course, is homosexual anyway).The complexity and intricateness of the heavily mathematical, scientific code-breaking concept of The Imitation Game is satisfyingly condensed so that the plot doesn't continue with frustrating convolution that of which frequently hinders many spy thrillers. Personally, a great screenplay can always simplify complicated ideas to the extent that it still feels natural and realistic. With all that being said, the script does tend to deliver some of the film's themes quite heavy-handedly in moments to the point of that sappiness that's become a staple of Oscar-bait biopics. Reciting the same line several times throughout the picture as to persist that thematic idea ('Sometimes, it is the people who no one imagines anything of, who do the things that no one can imagine') usually doesn't work, impacting with a mawkish taste rather than with sincerity. On another note, while I appreciated the inclusion of the disarmingly tragic conclusion to Turing's story, it seemingly glossed over it all as if in a rush to avoid a lingering gloomy mood to close on. The Imitation Game, regardless, is fully effective in its shuffling of undoubtedly significant subjects, including topical mentions of homosexual ostracism (and worse, punishment) and the important technological advancements of mankind—the capability of the human mind and the lengths of its imagination—and how much that has all reshaped our worldfrom then to now. Most of all, as the credits roll and the beautiful score surfaces, your eyes water for the men and women that lived in stress and died without recognition or appreciation.",9,5,13,28 December 2014
Jurassic World," Lighten Up and Enjoy the Return of Cool Dinosaurs
","One of the most fascinating thematic aspects of the Jurassic Park franchise has always been its exploration of man vs. nature–about man's delusions in actually believing they can control nature for the sake of (artificial) progress. How can we turn any natural facet to our own advantage–for war, for food, for simple amusement? The latest entry in the series, Jurassic World, has finally arrived after fourteen years of dinosaur-less cinema, and I'm proud to say that it's distinct enough from its predecessors. It chooses to go even deeper into the idea of not only genetically creating dinosaurs, but also genetically modifying them to the point where we begin to see hybrids of two different species.Following the severe mishap that was Jurassic Park because of–again– man's delusions (in that case, good-intentioned but seriously mistaken John Hammond), a new theme park has been built on the same island of Isla Nublar that seems to be working just fine and accepting thousands and thousands of visitors. It's Disney World except with dinosaurs–my god, how cool would that be? Aquariums, vast dinosaur-populated plains for touring, and other fun rides make up the majority of what this magical place has to offer. Of course, with such an ambitious idea, something terrible is always bound to transpire at one point or another. Suddenly, the boundaries we thought could easily keep humans safe from those spine-chilling carnivores are somehow demolished, and in comes chaos.This time around, instead of series favorites like Sam Neill as Dr. Grant or Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, we have 2014-born-movie-star Chris Pratt in the lead role as a muscular Velociraptor expert/trainer with the return of Bryce Dallas Howard as well (seriously, what happened to her? I thought The Help and Spider-Man 3 were financially successful). The two charismatic actors are surrounded by astounding production design and dazzling visual effects. You can whine about the pervasiveness of CGI all you want, but I've revisited the first film– Jurassic Park–a few days ago. Aside from the T-Rex, let's just say that those dinosaurs haven't been exactly aging well. In this film, I thought all of them looked completely believable and impressively- conceived; so I'm not complaining for the next few years (we'll see how it looks two decades down the road), especially when you get some amazing dino-versus-dino sequences. I won't spoil anything, but I'm sure you've always dreamed of seeing your favorite dinosaur species fiercely fighting it out and ripping each other to shreds with one's strength and the other's speed and calculation.Unlike The Lost World where the first half honestly bored me to a point where I was crazily yearning for some dinosaurs to finally pop up on- screen, Jurassic World presents you with such an immaculately-designed amusement park, using its two adolescent characters {13-year-old Gray (Ty Simpkins) and 20-year-old Zach (Nick Robinson)} to navigate through the various spellbinding museums and park tours while intercutting with the scientific/corporate storyline that shows us what's really going on behind all that awe and wonder. You're entertained from the get-go, and the long build-up to the appearance of the first killer dinosaur only excites you that much more.Now, the highest points of the series have always come in those times of real suspense and fright. That's precisely why I enjoyed Jurassic Park III a lot more than everyone else; almost everything in that forest was incredibly menacing and every step the characters took in whatever direction might've been their very last. I loved that dark, horror element. Unfortunately, save for one very particular end to a character, the deaths here are hardly creative and impactful. Very little blood and gore is shown in comparison to the last two movies (which were rated PG-13 too), and there's nothing that can show the sheer danger of an approaching carnivore more than the amount of damage it inflicts on human flesh. No, the villains are killed off rather quickly, and most of the major characters with a given name make it through alive. In sum, Jurassic World is definitely one of the lightest and most humorous entries in the franchise for better or worse. It's undoubtedly a lot of fun even when the situations turn to obvious implausibility.For future reference though, please, filmmakers–just please–stop this trend of self-awareness. Your movie isn't magically better and cooler just because you make some subtle remark about how you're a sequel/remake in today's heavily corporate Hollywood. 'Get it, guys? We're on the same page!' No, just stop Jurassic World does as much as it can to get all of those original fans back with pleasure; every moment seems to be carefully guiding itself along without upsetting and offending the viewers with unexpected, outlandish dinosaur segments like the 'Alan!' dream in Jurassic Park III or the T-Rex's King Kong-style rampage across San Diego in The Lost World. Of course, I just know that as I say this, some hardcore nitpickers, who have no sense of what lightening up and purely enjoying blockbuster entertainment means, will be ripping this film apart as well. I guess some people will have to get used to the fact that future sequels will never capture the magic in seeing dinosaurs on the big screen for the first time like the original did. That can only be accomplished once. Duh! Anyway, I fully commend the series for constantly reinventing and keeping each entry unique from the others.",8,18,43,14 June 2015
Cold War," Technically gorgeous but narratively dry
","I don't know about everyone else, but I'm a little tired of these two romantic formulas:1) Woman plays hard-to-get and then suddenly falls in deep love with the man without enough believable development (describes a lot of old-school Hollywood romantic films)2) a romance that goes awry and one starts sleeping with everyone in town to try to prove some kind of point and the other drinks himself away.The latter applies more so to this film. Perhaps it would've been a little more palatable if I connected to the characters at all, but in reality, I didn't. I couldn't feel the intensity of their relationship. Maybe it was because of the length of this film and the quick time period transitions or perhaps it was just because the characters lacked that semblance of a real human being but, instead, were just cinematic caricatures.The historical backdrop was what kept me engaged throughout the film, not the characters and their arc. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with such a critically-revered film from a genre that's usually up my alley. With Cold War, I just walked away with indifference.",5,3,7,16 February 2019
Prisoners," A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity
","Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. A spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the 'goody-two-shoes' heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. And holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. Speaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. Furthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and 'fun,' such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",7,199,270,26 September 2013
The Graduate," An Under-appreciated Classic!
","I find it disappointing that the Graduate isn't one of those constantly-talked-about classics like The Godfather, Kramer vs. Kramer, Apocalypse Now, The Shawshank Redemption, etc. I had mixed expectations for the film since I heard, prior to viewing, some negative opinions and positive ones from individuals who'd recently watched it. Now, let's talk about why this film should be just as remembered of a classic as the others above. First of all and- in my opinion- most importantly, the film carries with it a highly intriguing and interesting story that keeps you entertained the entire way as the clever plot unravels. You're presented with this socially angsty twenty-year-old who's basically helpless, surrounded by intimidating people and frightening situations. He's a character that the audience can't help but love. For me, I could find myself relating to his personality quite a bit. I, too, attempt to stray away from great attention and prefer a much calmer and less crowded environment. The story, itself, keeps your attention because it's just strongly gripping insofar as this character finds himself in extremely awkward and threatening situations. Personally- like with the scene where Benjamin is awkwardly attempting to avoid suspicion while getting a hotel room- I recalled similar instances with myself where I was about to engage in something that could be regrettable and had to deal with suspicious or curious bystanders, family members, or whatnot. While we're still on it, the acting was unbelievably good, especially Dustin Hoffman's break-out performance as Benjamin. The way he portrayed a timid and awkward character surely blew away the moviegoers that night of its release. His timing and speech delivery, overall, creates an absolutely believable story about this fully realistic outcast. The way he would retreat under the pool whenever he felt vulnerable or faced his imposing parents definitely moved me because I could honestly understand him in any given predicament. At times, I feel like finding some peaceful and impenetrable spot to socially leave the world and obtain some time to breathe. The script of this picture is brilliant from the convincing dialogue to the intelligent build-up of relationships and their interconnections. For the moment, let's delve into the more technical side of The Graduate since its cinematography and editing is exceptional- excellent, might I say. The evolution of filmmaking over the decades from when Hollywood first stemmed truly and impressively proved itself in this movie. For example, there's a particular scene where Benjamin is 'drifting' on the pool's air mattress, and he's interrupted by his irritating parents and the Robinsons themselves, and as they begin discussing his current uneventful life, the camera perfectly displays these incredibly condescending figures looking down at him with the sun shining so brightly that it seems to be blinding both the viewer and Benjamin as he's forced to look up at them. You sympathize with Benjamin because you feel their aggression and- again- condescending conversation about how he's not doing anything with his life, and I'm sure everyone's been in that sort of position, mentally or physically. Then, another shot shows Elaine as her confused face gets less and less blurry (indicating her progression towards fully understanding the mystery) until she finally realizes what's essentially transpiring between Benjamin and her own mother. In terms of editing, an instance showcases fast cutting to Mrs. Robinson's naked body as Benjamin attempts to ignore it but can't help his lust in a way. The film also smoothly and uniquely transitions to new settings without the audience even noticing at first as Benjamin exits the pool, walks to his room, and is suddenly found entering Mrs. Robinson's bed. Another strength of the camera-work is the noticeably lengthy shots where we witness entire conversations occurring in one single take or the scuba mask scene where a few minutes or so are filmed from a first-person perspective as Benjamin dives into his pool. In sum, the film seemed like a breath of fresh air that was affected by an unquestionably relatable protagonist that you felt for and his escape with the love of his life seemed utterly satisfying as well. Usually, happy endings done the way The Graduate did it come off as corny and clichéd, but your liking for the characters and their success overshadowed that aspect. So far, I've been loving all the films in class as this is yet another one I can't help but give high praise to.",9,0,0,23 September 2013
Singin' in the Rain," The Audience are all singin' in the rain!
","Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserablés being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clichéd- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.",9,0,1,23 September 2013
Elysium," Another Solid High-Octane Sci-Fi Entry from Blomkamp
","Elysium is Neill Blomkamp's second entry in the Sci-fi genre, following the tremendous success of District 9, which I loved. Now, all the pressure was on Neill Blomkamp to follow up to such a ground- breaking Sci-fi film that'll likely go down as a classic in the near future. Anyways, I hope too many don't mind because I just might go off on a political rant during the review as the film, itself, encourages such discussion- criticism on our way of living and the way we deal with medical care as a whole- because a surprising amount of critics and average movie-goers are panning the film, and a lot of them are blasting its political message, being that our current state of affairs will lead to a world where the poor will be left with no medical coverage or security whilst the privileged (the rich) live on some distant technological land in space where they have instant medical services and, basically, all the resources and attention is focused on such people, which make up a very miniscule portion of the total population, proved by the relatively small size of Elysium (the land occupied by the wealthy) when compared to Earth. Now, I promise I won't be spoiling anything, but the ending has left countless individuals enraged by its implications- most of them being conservative. Actually, I'm pretty sure a lot of people were completely fine with the world and the handling of affairs in the film because they're selfish, ignorant, and simply uninformed. Continuing on, one of the films greatest feats is its cinematography, ranging from the gritty and hopeless look of Earth to the beautiful and paradisiacal look of Elysium. In addition, the film's concept is fairly unfamiliar, and even if some people complain about it being familiar, oddly enough they rate films like The Avengers with a 92%. Elysium isn't all about explosions and pointless clichéd fights; it carries with it a weighty message that will leave concerned and informed individuals thinking about our functionality as a society. Those are the kind of films that should overcrowd the numerous superhero and zombie movies out there. And before someone approaches with the bullshit of it being my opinion, it's really not. It's more of a proper form of filmmaking- strong and memorable storytelling that isn't infested with Hollywood clichés. On top of all that, the cast is great. Matt Damon (Max), as usual, delivers a fine performance as does Sharlto Copley as the film's twisted villain (Kruger). Now, again, if people want to read paragraphs of the premise for the film, then look elsewhere. I hate when stories are spoiled for me, and I don't understand the kind of people who're willing to view 5-minute trailers that explain every single twist and turn in a certain film. Sorry, if you want to hear more about the characters or story and spoil yourself, I'm not going to be doing that in my reviews. What I'll be doing is critiquing the film's overall quality without compromising anything you'd be much better off surprising yourself with. All I'll say is that Earth is facing overpopulation and lack of resources to support its inflammation. Thus, the wealthy relocate themselves up to an open ship (How is this possible? I never understood how.) in space while the rest of the population have no choice but to suffer back on Earth. There is no middle class- you're either rich or poor, and this concept does a great job of presenting us with the potential consequences of the ascending division between the social classes of today. And so, with that being said, Elysium is able to provide the audience with a highly fascinating and believable concept all while presenting spectacular visuals from the futuristic guns and technological equipment to the impressing explosive action, and in that regard, the film does well to balance the drama and the action cleverly instead of overloading its watchers with non-stop, intense, and messy action that spans thirty to forty minutes. Neill Blomkamp trusts his viewers and hopes they possess the intelligence to enjoy such a story instead of desperately longing for setpiece after setpiece of invincible characters pummeling each other. After all has been said and done, Elysium is a breath of fresh air, but it never matches District 9's rare quality. In my book, a masterpiece has to shock you with its superior quality and keep you in your seat from beginning to end, making sure your eyes don't leave the screen. I'm not sure if it was the pacing or my attention span, but Elysium couldn't hook me that way. So, I can't rate it a 5. I just can't. The film's final act transforms into a casual-audience-friendly conclusion after awing us with its enthralling first two acts. As I previously stated, it might feel slightly familiar (according to numerous critics), but it tries hard to stand out from the crowd. At the end of the day, I can say that Elysium is definitely one of the best films of the year so far, and moviegoers would be utterly insane to miss this experience.",8,1,4,11 August 2013
Frank," Quirky Fun Mixed With Dramatic Flair
","The film marvelously commences as a stultified, young aspiring musician named Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) treads the streets of England, struggling to brainstorm ideas for a song. (I'm sure many of us—at some time in our lives—were randomly struck with a terrific idea for a song on a relaxed stroll or during a nice dinner.) This man tries to make something up from every observation. ♫'Lady in the red coat, what you doing with that bag? Lady in the blue coat, do you know the lady in the red coat?'♫ And finally, a less transparent and more obscure idea for a song suddenly pops into the mind as he nears his home—a song about 'little boxes.' The ridiculous songs will never end! He skips past the dinner and casual conversation with the parents to quickly jut down his ideas (the lyrics with the exact tune/pitch) before they're forever forgotten. Soon thereafter, he serendipitously runs into a band that's performing that same night. With their insane keyboardist, Lucas, trying to drown himself in the ocean in the background as cops circle around, the band manager hires Jon on the spot. And from there, he meets the band's peculiar, yet utterly genial, vocalist who invariably wears a large toy head, Frank (Michael Fassbender). After becoming familiar with the atmosphere and folk, Jon escapes his monotonous life for a short period with the band for an apparent gig in Ireland, but he soon realizes that they're all going to be staying in a cabin to record their next album. For how long, exactly? The band doesn't care to clarify even though Jon is expected back at his regular job come the following Monday. What follows is an unexpected series of days that reveal the bizarre characters of these people to their new member; he discovers that Don (Scoot McNairy), the band's manager, was once admitted into a mental hospital for his obsessive attraction to mannequins. Another member, Clara (Maggie Gyllenhall), is overly possessive and dismissive. So, he then stands by every night as Frank and the crew drunkenly wrestle and fling sticks at each other. What has he signed up for—the ultimate hippy clan? But his thoughts are conflicting because, at the same time, he finally feels free in the deepest parts of this forest, secluded from conformity and culture, and now at liberty to truly express his innermost artistic spirit—allow his mind to go wild like his fellow members clearly have. Alas, this means spending months producing cringe-worthy music and laughable lyrics that cause even the members to squirm at each other's disappointing compositions. Jon isn't allowed the time to shine while the naïve Frank excitedly presents his newest creations to awkward silence. It's going to take a while for their talent to seriously emerge and for the work to garner real attention. Undeniably, the most compelling aspect of the picture is this enigmatic presence that is Frank—finding out more about his background and personality, as well as witnessing Fassbender's amazing charm and charisma exude from behind a mere mask. His intriguing and equally amusing diction, next to his eccentric, child-like personality, certainly creates one of the most memorable characters of the year. The film does get considerably more gloomy and poignant as it progresses, focusing more on the impact of creative failure and mental instability rather than the heavy concentration on music which pervaded the first half. Suddenly, we begin to see different facets of Frank, other than the occasional quirky freak-out's and pensive postures. He becomes more of an adorable child that's in frightful need of consolation and encouragement. Frank, while not the most even/consistent of plots and indelible of stories, is primarily fueled by the sheer energy and versatility of Fassbender's astonishing performance. Will he finally reveal his actual face? What's behind there? Who really is Frank? The narrative gradually begins to tell us that he's actually filled with much more humanity and internal trouble than the early cartoonish figure seemed to indicate. If you're entering this film and expecting some 'kick-ass' rock music, Frank is definitely not that kind of hip movie, but you'll still be pleasantly surprised by the hilarity that ensues from parodying the beginning of a garage band. Nearly every track you hear will make you cringe with its painfully dull and uninspired lyrics, which is exactly what brilliantly makes it so darn hysterical.",7,2,5,7 September 2014
Selma," Sentimentality Might Either Sway Or Throw You Off
","Every year, there has to be a civil rights/slavery film, right? Well, in case you hadn't understood the inhumanity of slavery and/or segregation yet, here's another history lesson to remind and make you cry. Selma focuses on a very, very brief portion of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life in his valiant march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama so as to protest and pressure Lyndon B. Johnson into finally passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Although African-Americans technically had the right to vote during this time, there was nothing stopping the white authorities from intimidating black people far away from voting booths. Martin Luther King, Jr. will not have any of it though, and David Oyelowo, in his remarkable depiction of King, certainly conveys this through his partially melancholic and partially fierce 'enough-of- this!' eyes. Aside from the striking resemblance to the esteemed civil rights leader, Oyelowo absolutely brings everything he emotionally has within him to the platform during every one of his profound and furious speeches. And given the perfect timing of the film's release, relevant more than ever in the midst of relentless police brutality and continuing African-American injustice, the ferocity of the movement here is undoubtedly inspiring and rousing. The wonderful ensemble—including the likes of Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey, and Common—all know what's at stake in the past and present, but Tom Wilkinson (as President Johnson) and Tim Roth (as the repugnant George Wallace) also add contemplation and determined vehemence, respectively, to the opposing side. The lachrymose 60's soundtrack plays to ferociously shot and edited sequences of the marches and the consequential police brutality that strikes back. If you can't tell by now, my writing seems to be largely formed by sentimentality and closeness to the horrific predicament at hand in 2014 America. Frankly, Selma is a film that affects more through sentimental bias than anything else. Once everything is said and done— once a colder and more objective perspective that strips the relevance of the subject matter has been established—Selma really is a standard biopic that actually doesn't develop King into that much of a compelling character. The picture does make sure to highlight the usual family drama that occurs behind closed doors in every biopic from Malcolm X to Lincoln, but I just couldn't see enough of the man besides the obviously glorious, saintly portrait in which he's painted. Moreover, with the exception of the few marches/protests that rivetingly transpire throughout the film's duration, the pacing is unexpectedly plodding, and that's in large part because of how little material the film has to work with. Conversations that drag on for far too long essentially focus on one element of conversation: the planned march and of its hopeful results. Imagine that continuing on for a 2+- hour movie. Add in the fact that Selma suffers from quite a bit of historical inaccuracies, including the more negative representation of Lyndon B. Johnson, solely to implement further dramatic weight and conflict as overly-dramatized Hollywood films typically love to indulge themselves in. Of course, it'll still be an overwhelmingly celebrated film in its year of release much like 12 Years a Slave was last year (even though The Wolf of Wall Street and Her come up in more discussions a year later). It happens every time with the critics and awards industry players. Ask yourself: will Selma—a finely-crafted film that means well but is narratively and creatively forgettable/safe—honestly be remembered more than fascinatingly daring content this year like Inherent Vice and Interstellar?",6,4,11,10 January 2015
Jersey Boys," Is This a Movie or a Broadway Musical?
","Some films are better left as Broadway productions, and Jersey Boys unfortunately falls under that category. The film introduces us to four men, all ambitious in their own way, who eventually form a group of miraculous proportions. Thanks to the lead singer, Frankie Valli's uniquely feminine and unforgettably soothing voice, the band begins to soar to unimaginable heights, triumphantly selling record after record. This is the story of how they went from doing the mob's bidding to becoming iconic stars. However, it's an overlong biopic about musicians without the fascinating tours through their personal lives, which is what the best of musical biographies contain. Pictures like Ray and Walk the Line succeeded because they progressed with a balanced focus on both the musical career, as well as the troubles that stirred behind the scenes. Jersey Boys has very little of the latter. Sadly, the most entertaining moments are the introductory segments with the mob and the very last act where the power of their friendship is truly tested. As a matter of fact, the movie was too concentrated on their numerous stage performances and recording sessions to the point where it often got uninteresting. The over-2-hour-long duration certainly doesn't benefit the issue. Make no mistake; I had absolutely no problem with the music itself if that's the first idea that pops into one's mind upon reading my criticism. The music is indeed pleasant—occasionally mellow along with a fair share of upbeat tracks like the closing 'I Love You Baby' piece. Nevertheless, you can't let fanaticism for particular music cloud your judgment on the overall quality of a film or whatnot. This is a movie at the end of the day—not a musical show nor a play. Its plot—its narrative—undeniably suffers the further into the picture we get. The music is nice, but the story is ultimately uneventful and intermittently soporific. When it comes to the performances on the other hand, I was rather impressed with the showcase of their acting, considering that three of the four (excluding Vincent Piazza) aren't actual actors but the real Jersey Boys in the Broadway musical. Contrary to negative critical reception to their debuts, I found them to be fairly authentic the majority of the time. On a related note, John Lloyd Young does not look sixteen years old in the earlier scenes of the film. All of them seemingly appeared to be in their 20's, not in their teen's! Moreover, Clint Eastwood still struggles with convincing aging make-up because his older-aged characters always look too similar to their younger counterparts. When you grow into your elderly years, there's more that changes about your physical appearance than just the gray hair and some wrinkles. In terms of the cinematography, I felt a little mixed on it, but that has come to be a usual response with Eastwood's works. It appeared somewhat choppy and uninspired at times (lack of effort put into beautifying the period piece that it's supposed to be and looking the part) and other times classy/elegant in a bluish and stylishly gray hue (a more fitting look for the era). If you love the music with a passion and/or if you're a serious fan of the Broadway production, Jersey Boys is worth a look. Otherwise, its dull narrative and absent energy certainly won't appease the general moviegoer.",5,3,17,27 June 2014
12 Years a Slave," An Emotionally Draining and Thought-Provoking Cinematic Event
","With 12 Years a Slave comes a dour and distressing story about Solomon Northup, a freedman and a talented violinist, who was kidnapped one night and sold into slavery. This true story vividly captures his struggles and grueling journey through a very dark time. Now, slavery has recently become a relevant topic even though it no longer exists, but several films have released nonetheless, forcing us to relive the horrors that beset a once troubled race. As a matter of forewarning, this film is raw and relentless in its presentation for it's bound to disturb and place you in a level of discomfort that's rarely visited. You will be forced, as a viewer, to witness atrocious scenes of torture and whippings specifically as misty blood sprays into the air and the sight of deep and thick cuts makes you cringe to no end. By the end of the film, half of the theater was in tears, blowing their noses and withdrawing their tissues. It was certainly difficult to bear the missed opportunities and even larger troubles in a stricter environment. Ultimately, the most crucial services to the power of this picture relates to its performances. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, and Lupita Nyong'O all putting in terrific effort and fully exhausting us with deep emotion. In addition, the rest of the supporting cast features the likes of Brad Pitt, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Benedict Cumberbatch, and more- very impressive indeed. At the rolling of its credits, we are officially drained of any sense of happiness. Though the film isn't economic and takes its time with some ironic shots of beauty and others of a grim terrain, it's mercilessly saddening once its content fully sinks in and you understand the 'bigger picture.' The film's pacing relaxes in certain moments as particularly lengthy shots are utilized in order to realistically depict a situation, excluding any cinematic distractions. As I've mentioned before, this method produces the kind of footage that's raw and gritty; a scene will persist as it's gradually encompassed by a hopeless tone and hurtful details. What packs the punch to the fullest extent of emotion is the incredible score by Hans Zimmer. It does sound a bit like Inception's soundtrack, but it's undoubtedly effective in its complement to a disheartening segment. 'I survive! I will not fall into despair...I will kick myself harder until freedom is opportune.' Powerful words are spoken, and although a film with such subject matter could've easily hit the point of excessive sentimentality and corny dialogue, the conversations actually carry some very strong points. This experience is arguably an incredibly important one, which is likely why it's garnering this amount of praise and hype. The treatment of the white supremacist race towards a seemingly dissimilar kind can apply to any generation of our history and though the relationship isn't nearly as cruel, the feeling of utter discrimination is what faces both immigrants and homosexuals in contemporary times. Frankly, it's fascinating how modern peoples remain disgusted by these practices, but if you were to somehow teleport them to the age of slavery, would they feel exactly the same way? Racism has not ceased to exist, and most of the informed and aware would surely agree. Hopefully, this film will stir awareness within the more ignorant and prejudiced; I won't point any fingers, but you know. Upon viewing such atrocities, I can't imagine how society of the past could possibly deem such a way of life and action rightful. Of course, we could delve into philosophy and human nature, regarding greed and selfishness, for a considerable period of time, but I'd rather not. With that being said, I honestly don't think it innovatively accomplishes anything but its emotionally compelling execution is what the applause might be directed at, at least for me. Several sequences, though, contain rather muttered speech that somewhat complicated the state of affairs as I couldn't find myself making out what the characters were exactly speaking of. 12 Years a Slave will shock you and leave you in contemplation and vexation. It will be one of those events in cinema where the audience shouldn't be expecting excitement, enchanting visuals, or mindless action but a truly thought-provoking production that will formidably rival the best films this year.",7,2,5,10 November 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," The Must-See Blockbuster of the Summer
","Summer has been the staple season for the studios' uninspired, unoriginal, and money-driven projects, but that rare moment when a decent blockbuster comes along that completely contradicts all three of those points is the moment of unimaginable relief. Edge of Tomorrow is very much that rare moment for this year's summer, but that shouldn't be surprising considering the fact that Tom Cruise almost always chooses the best projects even when they're primarily action flicks. In this case, the movie starts off incredibly strong as you remain fascinated, trying to figure out what exactly is transpiring on-screen while being tossed into the very heat of the moment. The spectacle benefits from the likable and charismatic presence of Tom Cruise, portraying a respected officer of the US army named (Major) William Cage who is suddenly commanded to enter the front lines of the most heated destination in the current war between men and alien: France. He is understandably frightened—very much so to the point where he desperately attempts to convince the General otherwise and avoid this disposition at all costs (even reaching the extent of blackmailing this General). Unfortunately, his persuasive skills falter, and thus, he wakes up at an army base soon thereafter, fully unprepared as he heads into combat in a robust exosuit with his fellow soldiers. Eventually, Cage discovers that he wields a terribly powerful, yet utterly outlandish, power that allows him to wake up at a particular point in the day every time he diesin any circumstance. Edge of Tomorrow features a refreshingly unique story and instead of simply duplicating Groundhog Day's style and structure like many accused it of doing before even seeing the film, it focuses on Tom Cruise's incessant string of deaths (presented more lightheartedly than it sounds) which undeniably helps keep the film fresh and interesting. The thrilling picture boasts a very tight and smart script that excellently guides the viewers through a complex and original plot without stumbling and bewildering us, cleverly maneuvering around any trap that might tire the audience due to the repetition that's infused in its concept. It does so by constantly and creatively finding new ways to continue amusing and intriguing the audience, including taking advantage of the witty humor that the ideas of such a story provoke. Emily Blunt brings her extraordinary acting chops and newfound badassery to unite with Tom Cruise's character and fight this highly threatening enemy side-by-side. The pairing generates astonishing chemistry that results in some terrific, heartfelt, and hilarious moments between the two. In addition, the film also possesses a very impressive look to it through its filmic grayness and grit, featuring some truly exciting action sequences where all kinds of objects and beings fly past the camera while water and dirt is spattering the screen. In other words, this production is beautifully intense. The enemies of this narrative (called Mimics) are tremendously terrifying; their elastic, arachnid- like appearance already inspires sheer panic, but as soon as they start effortlessly swarming and killing every soldier in their sight, you perfectly realize that these are not just the standard summer blockbuster villains that are easily fought off by a heroic and honorable protagonist. With that being said, after a slew of intelligent twists and turns, this Sci-fi extravaganza culminated unsatisfyingly, heavily compromising when it came time to wrap up. The reluctance to a darker finish is ridiculous and certainly didn't fit the confident and bleak direction the narrative promised. You could tell how unfitting it was just by glancing at its source material—a Japanese novel titled All You Need Is Kill, which contains a far darker ending, but obviously Hollywood thought it was too large of a risk since their mentality that every movie should end as a crowd-pleaser still remains. Even though its climax was delivered weakly and insecurely, Edge of Tomorrow—as a whole— is undoubtedly the best summer blockbuster so far, exceptionally balancing pure fun, humor, and a seriously thought-provoking story.",8,7,12,11 June 2014
Whiplash," The Most Exhilarating Film About Music
","Rash ambition has been quite the popular theme to explore this year with just last week's Nightcrawler considerably raising expectations on the honesty and depth we can witness from such commentary. Our culture —the dog-eat-dog system—grooms us to be such ferocious competitors and through it, we lose more and more of our humanity. We lose sight of the people and the objects around us, and all focus is concentrated on one single objective like a cheetah menacingly sighting its prey. Well, it's Andrew Neyman's (Miles Teller) first year at the (fictional) best music school in the country, Schaffer Conservatory, and he wants to make something extraordinary out of it. Playing drums from a very young age, he has reached the point of maturity in which he wants to excel beyond 'cute' talent that family simply compliments and prove himself in front of true professionals. Unfortunately, it's going to exhaust his soul and really test his endurance to reach that level. The jazz orchestra's conductor, Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who's promising that end goal of potential success and fame, is an abrasive, foul-mouthed, and mercilessly strict nightmare who puts his students through torture before they can even hope to perform in front of a large crowd or make it into serious competitions. To merely survive his class is to be one of the absolute best. Andrew has no idea what he's in for though, but when he starts getting slapped around and coarsely yelled at because his drum beats were rushing (and in other moments, dragging) by 'just a hair,' the lengths he'll have to reach for in order to ultimately prove himself become clearer. His hands already bleeding and his face heavily perspiring, how much harder and faster can he pound those drums to reach that paramount level? Competition out in the world is undoubtedly fierce, and after barely tolerating days after days of soul-crushing insults that can send anyone's self-esteem into oblivion, an even greater, desperate drive begins to consume Andrew. Realizing that becoming one of the greats is going to require hard confidence and unrelenting ambition, Andrew's attitude suddenly begins to take on an utterly smug, egocentric nature as he loudly proclaims that he's far superior to any of his peers and is very well on his way to becoming the next Buddy Rich. At this point, he doesn't even bother making superficial friends or attempting to please all the people around that are essentially meaningless in his climb to prosperity. Whiplash certainly remains tense throughout its entire duration as we see Andrew suffering, pounding the drums at an unbelievably rapid rate, (literally) with blood, sweat, and tears, which only gradually increases from there with every practice session and every vile rant from his teacher. Thrillingly immersive close-up shots of the snares and the pedals and the drumsticks—the whole intricate process is edited with such intensity that anyone in the audience, regardless of whether or not they have a musical background, feels the rush and taps their feet along to the ceaselessly energetic drum solos as Andrew only beats at it harder and harder. Of course, definitely one of the crucial elements of this picture is its two central performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, which are completely revelatory in their excellence—the emotional roller-coaster between student and teacher with the former's hope/assurance slowly draining away—yet desperation totally escalating— and the latter's uncompromising brutality pushing his students beyond capability and expectancy. What we have is a relationship that culminates in a compellingly angry battle of egos.The screenplay/dialogue moves along with such a sassy, swift pace— obviously complementing the hasty beat of the jazz music that it represents—but also implements a surprising amount of hilarious dry humor beneath all the emotional and philosophical darkness. Right from the very first shot as the film opens up to a long murky corridor with Andrew at the end of it practicing and practicing on his drums, you can tell how gloomy Whiplash is going to become by its prevalent darkened color. Everything (from the crowded streets of New York City to the haunting classroom) is presented with a transparent shade to these environments that would otherwise be brighter. However, by the end, Whiplash's thematic intentions become somewhat ambiguous—is it meant to be a dark critique on impossible ambition (because then its consequences and negative impact are not satisfyingly underlined) or is it an inspiring crowd-pleaser as some critics are pointing out (which is terribly frightening)? The actions and logic of the narrative do eventually begin to reach a troubling level in believability as the film nears its end, but the story isn't meant to be taken absolutely literally. The overall package is more or less a stark metaphor on the dangerous attitude that leads to final triumph but also destroys one's character and relationships in the meantime. 'There are no two words in the English language that are more harmful than good job,' Terrence claims. A man will never be as definitively great in his craft if he's not pushed to the absolute limit, okay, but what/when exactly is that limit?",9,0,3,8 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wildest Three Hours of Cinema
","Jordan Belfort was one of the most successful stockbrokers, but how did he get there? When he did get there, what did he do with the wealth he had so quickly accumulated? Martin Scorsese's newest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, recounts this shocking true story, exposing us to the monsters that our economic system- capitalism- has produced. To truly understand Belfort's (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) sheer insanity and criminality, what we witness herein is an energetic, 3-hour narrative that's fueled by sex, drugs, profanity, and hilarity. This is an exemplar of the paths the moguls and magnates pull through in order to finally reach affluence. As usual, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers another powerful performance; in fact, this could be his best yet. He's high, he's inebriate, he's irate, he's desperate or ambitious, he's dejected, he's just deranged- the list goes on. The Wolf of Wall Street is fitting proof of this brilliant actor's range, but it also proves how utterly pathetic it is that he's still not carrying a few, or at least one, Oscar's. In this case, he goes all out, and he goes to lengths and depths we haven't seen him touch yet. In addition, he's absolutely hilarious, discovering the perfect vehicle to showcase his comedic talent. What more can the guy demonstrate to grab the Academy's attention? Then again, since he hasn't won an Academy Award yet, it totally substantiates how essentially unimportant those awards are anyways. It evinces that actors shouldn't feel doubtful of their own talents just because they can't call themselves an Oscar or Golden Globe (to a lesser extent) winner. Jonah Hill also brings his A-game, giving us yet another remarkably unhinged character to exist next to DiCaprio's as we see them participate in some of the most downright outrageous sequences. In all honesty, the entire cast shines as we sight the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Jon Berenthal, Jean Dujardin, and much more. The screenplay is undoubtedly another profound strength of the film's, providing us with some of the most ingenious dialogue this year. Furthermore, it consistently brings out the richness of these characters- their personalities and relationships, incorporating irony and/or farcicality to each and every segment. Again, Wolf doesn't only cast us into the lowest depths of humanity and wrenches us until we cry foul (in consequence to the individuals' despicable acts), but it's also one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, absolutely overshadowing most of the comedies we received these past twelve months. It comprises a plethora of memorable and incredibly amusing scenes that left the whole audience bawling with laughter. Like American Hustle though, those scenes blur the lines between what's hysterical and what's just disturbing and dispiriting. Without those boundaries and sensibility, almost every scene is bound to induce laughter of some kind. As with Scorsese's numerous other projects like The Aviator and Goodfellas, a considerable portion of the protagonist's life is revealed with the plot's progression, spanning decades. With that, we begin to sense the 3-hour duration, and it's not exactly that the film drags out in any particular spots or hits a sluggish pace in general, it's merely that we're reliving a single man's history, advancing through the high's, low's, and more relaxed stages of his maniacal life. Understandably, a viewer would begin to feel the lengthiness after so many wild events have already transpired and yet it seems like the story is leading us to another one. Now, many critics have panned the production's willingness and, perhaps, eagerness to delve into persistent lunacy. Of course, what we see is excessive and imprudent, but that's surely what the film is attempting to convey in the first place- these lavish lifestyles are intemperate beyond remorse and the decadence seen means exactly that never is it all apparently enough in our culture - the copious money, the gorgeous women, the sensation of drugs, and whatnot. They just don't feel that temptation to quit the debauchery and leave it all behind for betterment. Anyways, The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely one of the best films of this past year and another exceptional entry in Scorsese's filmography. Considering DiCaprio's presence, Scorsese's directorial involvement, and a riveting story to top it off, the real question isn't 'why should I go see this movie?' The question is: why, in any possibility, shouldn't I?",9,3,11,26 December 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," All Hope Is Not Lost
","Once upon a time, Peter Jackson was overwhelmingly lauded for translating a literary masterpiece into a cinematic masterpiece: the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Despite their immense runtimes, there was never a wasted moment—in fact, the fans begged for an even longer cut of these films (these cuts turned out to be 20-40 minutes longer, still without any hint of overstretching). There was so much to explore in that classically grim and grand tale, adapted from three separate sizable novels (the original LOTR—although once compiled into one enormous book by J.R.R. Tolkien—was split into three books by the publisher later on). However, Tolkien's prequel, The Hobbit, doesn't have that much material in one single novel to warrant three 2 ½ hour movies, which is why this recent trilogy has honestly overstayed its welcome and presented us with a seriously disposable middle point—The Desolation of Smaug—that barely contributed to the overall narrative. Jackson, like George Lucas, has simply become so fanatically passionate about this world that he'd be willing to showcase every acre of Middle Earth if it was his choice; in a way, that's sweet (or there could be a more cynical aspect to it), but few people are asking for this much. The Battle of Five Armies immediately begins with the ultimate clash against Smaug (that last segment of Desolation of Smaug could've just been inserted here and everything else therein scrapped), which ends fairly quickly only for the situation to now center on Thorin's gradually corrupting mind—his obstinate, greedy hold over the treasure he has finally reached in the vast caves of the Lonely Mountains. A colossal war soon ensues, involving the dwarfs, the humans, the elves, the eagles, and the orcs, over this gold—lust for wealth and power has always been a motif in the tales of Middle Earth. Entering the theater with lowered expectations following disappointment from the last entry, I actually walked out surprised with how wildly entertaining the film was throughout most of its duration. At this point, some of the more central characters and relationships were fully developed, allowing for more audience investment in their arcs and endgames. The riveting dynamic between Thorin (Richard Armitage) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman), in particular, remained the highlight, as well as the fuel to carry the film from a slower build-up to a climactic finale with satisfying pace. Aside from its ending, which was dragged out with a totally relaxed and plodding speed almost to the excruciating extent of Return of the King, there was never a dull moment that even remotely compared to the boringly prolonged sequence with Smaug towards the end of its predecessor. When there wasn't interestingly-choreographed and colossally-scoped action on-screen, the intriguing evolution of certain characters' paths was placed at the forefront. Moreover, while the orcs were as effortless to kill as ever, the primary villains (Azog, Bolg) took arduous, calculating confrontations with powered warriors like Legolas, Tauriel, Thorin, Gandalf, and more to overcome. On the other hand, instead of putting effort into utilizing impeccable practical effects to meticulously assemble a believable Middle Earth like Jackson accomplished with the LOTR trilogy, the use of CGI this time around really makes everything appear so cartoony and cheap for such a big-budget epic. The first twenty minutes of the picture specifically exhibit The Hobbit at its visual worst with the sight of an animated-like village being ravaged by unconvincing fire effects. Perhaps, the creatures seem fascinatingly-envisioned, especially Smaug, but the whole production occasionally looks like one giant cartoon— totally unlike LOTR.",7,4,9,21 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Uh Oh, Critic Says Birdman Isn't Perfect
","Long gone are the days of Michael Keaton's Batman stardom. Hollywood has dramatically changed since then, and Keaton has found himself in a totally different position, replaced by new superstars to take up the superhero and blockbuster roles. Those days of fame and flowing paychecks have waned for not only the actor but the man who he intimately portrays in this black comedy, Riggan Thomson. Twenty years since starring in the Birdman franchise (ha, get it?), he has diminished into obscurity—hardly drawing in crowds for barely- constructed Broadway productions. That inherent feeling of self- importance is killing Riggan, the artist, inside with how far he has faded from the public eye. If there's one thing Birdman's narrative is particularly exceptional at, it's the honest and cynical look at the sheer egoism and narcissism that make up artists/actors. You always need to feel like you're the highlight of the show—the one that gets the headlines and fan girls. But when the startling truth of your irrelevance becomes realized, an ego hurt is like a soul penetrated with a keen knife. Riggan is struggling to finally make that comeback and eventually leave the world with a true legacy. He desperately wants people to admire him and to remember him as the legend his alter ego—the deep-voiced, snarky Birdman himself—and he think he is. There's no question that this is one of those films that rely more on its performances than its plot/narrative. Consequently, this is where mixed feelings materialize, but Alejandro Iñárritu's latest ambitious picture still boasts an incredible ensemble nonetheless that ranges from the greats like Naomi Watts and Edward Norton to newcomers who're still on the path to prove themselves like Zach Galifianakis and Emma Stone. Norton seemingly plays a role that also mocks his career and well-known personality. Whereas Keaton is yearning for admiration and respect here, Norton doesn't give two hoots about audience reception as he focuses more on his utter artistry and method acting ability, despite letting his bossiness and arrogance dominate the backstage production. Stone plays Riggin's daughter, Sam, who's a recovering drug addict but also frankly exasperated by her father's self-centered tendencies, constantly hanging around the theater with snide remarks. The one-take, franticly intrusive cinematography—seamlessly continuous at least in appearance—plays another essential character that complements and strengthens the already-excellent performances with a fair share of close-ups and orbital shots, traversing through majestically foggy corridors and the tragically theatrical stage to the perpetual sound of pounding drums. Thankfully, cinematographer Emmanuele Lubezski (also wildly impressing us last year with Gravity's arrant technical prowess) refrains from distracting the audience with blatant visual showiness since the fast-paced drama of stress on-screen would immediately take me back into the story whenever I'd momentarily heed the actual maneuvering of the camera. With that being said, Birdman is not perfect even though I hear the majority enthusiastically praising its genius and applauding it much like the easily-charmed audience that show up to see Riggan. A particular memorable scene in the film features a showdown between the artist (Riggan or Norton's Mike) and a New York Times critic (played effectively by Lindsay Duncan) as the two entertainingly bash each other with non-stop hurtful comments. It's clear that Birdman doesn't overtly respect the movie/theatre critic (it's unsurprising since many critics have had issues with Iñárritu's style over the years—Babel and Biutiful, for instance) as it rants with a fire about how especially entitled and unappreciative the critics are. Regardless of the wild generalizations and exaggerations made here, it keeps going and going with so much anger that the effect might either be that of irksome offense to the average critic or that of guilt. Sadly and perhaps guiltily, to vast irony, this is the point where I have to criticize this work of art (oh no!) because Birdman does indeed suffer from issues I simply couldn't ignore—problems that left me with considerable dissatisfaction, angry at the film for not allowing me to leave with the same pleasure like everyone else. First of all—as with most of Iñárritu's work—the film is so self-indulgent that I practically could see it incessantly grinning at just how clever it thinks its dialogue/screenplay is, even though everything executed and delivered quite heavy-handedly. There's no sense of subtlety and calmness to be found since the story is essentially an epic boisterous tirade. Surprisingly for such a prestigious picture, it also carries with plentiful of immature, shallow humor ('this place smells like balls'), and personally, most of the dark comedy intended didn't exactly deliver—occasionally a half-suppressed laugh to be had. The humor overall either felt underwhelming in its simplicity at times or like it was trying really hard to be witty in other moments. The ending was easily the most frustrating segment of this parade, being that it extended far beyond adequacy even though neither the narrative nor the thematic material was any more strengthened by the protracted length. Not to delve into spoilers, but the whole ordeal seemed like it was more so attempting to end on a positive/hopeful note rather than on a poignant, satirically startling shot that literally left my jaw open. Overall, when a film exists more for its themes rather than a compelling narrative, that's when I usually identify a hint of pretension within. Even despite its magnificent performances, phenomenal cinematography, and catchy score, Birdman can understandably be deemed slightly pretentious and schizophrenic (with the way it tries to shove more and more ideas and messages into its already-bloated satire while bouncing back and further between them with mumbling enunciation).",8,3,12,6 November 2014
The Conjuring," Another Traditional Haunted-House Story
","From the man who brought you Saw and Insidious, The Conjuring casts you into a familiar setting- one that revolves around a haunted house, a terrified family, and some experienced veterans in this paranormal field. What follows is an incredibly tense and frightening ride through a traditional haunted-house story. The film's major highlight is its effective use of jump-scares and placing you into that seat of hopelessness and the unknown of what's to come next, and I have to say that the cinematography is terrific. Horror movies, in general, really have to rely on cameras to deliver the scariest experience to their audience from focusing on aghast faces to subtle placements of certain items. Anyways, The Conjuring's overall look proves how much more stupendous a film camera is over a digital one, but that's beside the point. This film greatly depends on jump- scares to affright its watchers, and it accomplishes just that as I found countless individuals in the room screaming, gasping, and holding on to their friends in anticipation of what awaits. Admittedly, there were numerous sequences that had me holding onto my chair, shocked at what just transpired and hoping for that particular character to escape unharmed. Rightfully so, the film takes a while to get to the problem of it all as it takes its time building up its characters (there are actually two branching perspectives) and the issue that's arising within the house, and as usual in most horror films, the buildup is much more entertaining and daunting than its climax. On top of the scares, the Conjuring also benefits from its strong acting performances from the likes of Vera Farmiga to Patrick Wilson to even the kids (yes, usually the kids in horror films are horrible actors, but this time, they're extremely believable). The chemistry between Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) is quite evident, and the other family delivers as well. Whenever the kids are endangered, you're dramatically concerned. Then, there's the script, which is satisfying in some parts and underwhelming in others. The greatest element that The Conjuring suffers from is its too-familiar 'everything'- from the setting to the characters to the story and its progression. The film contains almost every single clichÃ© that most haunted-house movies are riddled with. At times, a specific scene feels utterly cheesy and slightly lackluster due to the fact that we've heard these characters saying these exact lines and performing these exact actions in other movies to the point where it feels predictable and unbelievable, ruining the immersion level in the meantime. It's also a little hilarious that after so many haunted stories, yet another family foolishly decides to move into an obviously creepy home that sees its floors constantly creak and its basement scream 'do not come down here!' The home is old and messy, and there's a freakish tree resting right in the front-yard. How can you not be suspicious right from the get-go?! In fact, during the first half of the film, I wondered why James Wan chose to direct this picture when it's so similar to Insidious. At the moment, haunted-house movies are a fad that should finally be stopped because at this point, no matter how horrifying said movie is, the film will lose points because of its traditional and uninspired route. The music was okay, but at times, it was just more of the same generic horror music that you've heard in almost every single haunted- house movie before it, but then when that bass kicks in, your feet start tapping against the floor and your hands begin shaking. In the end, The Conjuring shocks you and disturbs you while you're in that theater room, but after you leave, you're likely to forget the ending and perhaps confuse the film with another one when it's brought up in a conversation. Simply put, if you're looking for a new horror film with an interesting concept and a memorable, unique experience, The Conjuring is not the place to look, but since there's a shortage of decent horror flicks recently, it'd be nice to actually witness an effectively scary one for a change. In that case, you can't go wrong with The Conjuring. If half of my theater screamed like a group of little girls, chances are you might to.",7,0,1,23 July 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Mr. Disney, Is That Really You?
","Wait, what? Disney is making a film about Walt Disney? This surely can't be good or genuine. Fortunately, I was proved wrong because even for those who're desperately attempting to discover some substantial flaw, the movie quickly wins you over. Saving Mr. Banks essentially covers the real-life accounts of Disney's and P.L. Travers' (the author of Mary Poppins) relationship. By the time of the early 1960's, Walt Disney had already become the greatest of moguls in Hollywood and his vast empire had already been established. In sum, he was largely successful- living the dream- but one astronomical desire plagued his mind: the wish to capture one of his favorite books (Mary Poppins) on the big screen in typical, magical Disney fashion. However, Travers wasn't exactly the friendliest and easiest individual to work with, fretting over every single detail of life. Once her agent and Walt Disney Pictures finally convinces her to take a flight to LA and sign on for the project, firstly ensuring her significant control behind the production, the true issue emerges: how will the picture come to be when you have two powerful storytellers vying with their own visions? Throughout the narrative, we alternate between the present and Travers' past in which she grows up in Australia with a troubled family that are forced to deal with life-threatening difficulties. Basically, we're allowed the room to breath and laugh for a certain amount of time, and then, we're relocated to the tear-jerking story of her past, and it switches back and forth from thereon. This institutes a welcoming balance between raw emotion (I could honestly feel the tears lingering in my eyes, waiting to descend) and fun/hilarity. Using the sheer feistiness of Emma Thompson's character (Travers), we're met with plenty of hysterical scenes in which she struggles to adapt to an environment she's not exactly fond of. A significant factor behind the amusement- aside from its utter joviality- to be had with this film are the mesmerizing performances. Emma Thompson is exceptional and will undoubtedly be one of my nominees for Best Actress this year when considering her ability to convincingly pull off a truculent role, being exposed to various circumstances as we observe the genuine reactions. Colin Farrell portrays her alcoholic and deeply distressed father whenever we encounter yet another flashback. Needless to say, his performance definitely deserves recognition; in fact, Farrell and Thompson persistently compete with one another as I found both renditions highly remarkable. Rarely do I witness Farrell take on such a dramatic and mentally taxing role, and he fully delivers in this case. And, of course, we have everyone's favorite, Tom Hanks, who depicts Walt Disney in all his larger-than-life stature. Quite interestingly, the premise sees a rare storyteller (who still possesses artistic integrity and a strong will in what the next step is) face off against a standard businessman who is looking to persuade and reap profits. Here is ultimately where my issue lies: it seems like an overly positive and safe representation of the Walt Disney who (reportedly) infamously supported the Nazi's, carried a sexist mentality, and so on. That's particularly why I was bothered by Disney Pictures' involvement in this cinematic piece since- no matter what- they'd most absolutely downplay any negative characteristics of Walt Disney. With the story's progression, we never caught any hints of his greed (any instances were played off as light jokes), aggressive ambition for seizing his goals, etc. No, apparently, Walt Disney was thoughtful, kind, and joyous. As we continue along with this sensational tale, a terrific soundtrack, brought to you by the amazing Thomas Newman's talent and vigor, complements the varying emotion we encounter therein; sometimes lively and gleeful- effectively capturing the alluring atmosphere- and sometimes tragic and melancholy- focusing on the troublous life her younger self led- (what Newman does best as can be proved by the likes of Road to Perdition, The Green Mile, American Beauty, etc.). With that being said, some of the tracks feel slightly too similar to The Newsroom's theme song. From time to time, Newman enjoys repeating himself, but it's still beauty to one's ears, regardless. While we're on the subject of Travers' childhood, I found the whole 'flashback' storyline more intriguing than the main one with the plot's advancement. There was just so much more transpiring in history- dramatic, surprising- while the present merely concentrated on Travers' predictable development as a human being. This being a Disney movie at the end of the day, to no surprise, the story loses a fair share of cynicism towards the end, and the last half an hour just feels too 'Disney-like,' which is jarring when regarding the more authentic feel of the first half. In a predictable manner, Travers loses that fiery flare, and a sense of sentimentality suddenly invades the story. All in all, there's no doubt that I immensely enjoyed Saving Mr. Banks, and the time of year is certainly fitting for such a pleasurable and humorous experience. There's too much likability within for me to expect any probable disappointment, and thus, I enthusiastically recommend this magical picture to everyone.",8,1,4,23 December 2013
Lucy," Tries To Be Smart but Embarrassingly Fails
","Scarlett Johansson has been on quite the roll as an action star as of late, bouncing back and forth between her more expensive (Marvel) projects and more peculiar and experimental ones. Though Lucy might appear to be the former—a clichéd, loud extravaganza of mindless, fun action—from the trailers and the like, the truth is that it (somewhat) belongs to the category of the latter. A Taiwanese mob implants a mysterious drug called CPH4 into her stomach, and very soon, she discovers that access to her cerebral capacity has surpassed that of the normal human being. Apparently, that means that she can now wield ridiculous superpowers that allow her to tap into people's memories and extract any bit of information from whatever object/individual that existed within. It also means that she can levitate anything and anyone, as well as teleport to any location she so wishes. Right from the get-go, you'll have to get used to the fact that the premise is incredibly unbelievable; the plot will get even more outlandish as it progresses, and don't worry: the movie will warn you with a continually increasing percentage (indicating just how much of the brain she can now utilize) every time events are about to become even more preposterously implausible. Once you get past the utter lack of realism and plethora of plot holes, what you experience is pretty badass. It's heavily stylized with its sci-fi components—it honestly reminded me of something like The Matrix, especially when considering the more twisted acts of violence. Complemented by beautiful cinematography (lavished with appealing colors and futuristic characteristics), this film is a blast—a lightning pace and intriguing set-up. Everything, aside from the ending, offers an abundance of thrilling amusement, and part of it obviously is due to Johansson's fierce presence. Even though Marvel Studios' rendition of Black Widow is softer and more forgiving, Lucy can be ruthless and calculating just like the original Marvel comics portrayed the Russian spy, Black Widow, as. However, eventually, the narrative takes a turn for the insane as convolution and far-fetched absurdity floods the plot and the sheer power Lucy truly holds furthers into the realm of sheer impossibility. The focus on high-octane, compulsive action is therefore abandoned and substituted with a confusing climax that only makes you wonder about what the hell this film which started out with a gripping basis has transformed into. So yes, the tale's unraveling heightens in ludicrousness, but at least, it's entertaining and cool. On the other hand, when it comes to the film's attempt to assess the themes and depth to which the idea of an increase in cerebral capacity goes, the arguable failure of this project certainly arises. First of all, this story is centered around a myth (humans only use 10% of their brains) that's already been debunked by guffawing scientists, creating irritation in the viewer as they continue to roll their eyes at the filmmakers' ignorance and clear unwillingness to properly research the subject. Secondly, as I've pointed out, this increase in intelligence—the ability to use more of your mind—does not mean that you'll suddenly turn into some terribly powerful superhero. If Besson didn't concentrate on producing a Limitless rip-off and simply decided to produce an absorbing sci-fi action film instead, Lucy wouldn't have been as annoying of a film, but if we're incorporating serious topics that beg the audience to recognize intellect in the project, don't expect to hold that compelled audience when you begin betraying realism and truth (of the topic). At the end of the day, Lucy is mostly fun, but it's ironically stupid fun as much as it tries to be smart fun.",6,10,35,30 July 2014
Unbroken," Exactly What You'd Expect From Angelina Jolie
","There are some filmmakers/storytellers that carry a very cynical and cold vision when depicting people and their stories—filmmakers that are reluctant to get too close to their subjects so that a cornucopia of biased tenderness doesn't consume them and birth a fully reverential (blandly extoling) tale about this particular subject. Angelina Jolie happens to have a different agenda, on the opposite end of this spectrum, and considering we know quite a bit about her after all these years already, the most accurate adjective I can give to her second directorial entry: 'unsurprising.' Jolie has a very warm, sentimental, and hopeful attitude about her. In this case, I can't confidently criticize her for overreaching on the sentimentality scale; the fact of the matter is that it gets tricky when one readies himself to review a true story. I, myself, can't take that away from the film or Louis Zamperini who is an incredible human being that survived an unbelievably incredible life—from an impeccable runner representing the US in the Olympics to a soldier who's stranded out in the middle of the ocean to a helpless prisoner in a ruthless Japanese internment camp. This all sounds very well like an 'Oscar-bait' kind of Hollywood motion picture, but again, it actually happens to be an insane true story. However, just because it's true and oh-so-inspiring, it doesn't mean that I can be easily swayed into absolutely admiring it. You can call me cold-hearted or you can just call me objective and hesitant. Admittedly, I don't have the ability to question the exact accuracy of all the miniscule heroic, unrelenting details of Zamperini's journey presented here, but I definitely can scrutinize the quality and appropriateness of its translation to the big screen. After this year's earlier blockbuster, Maleficent, which shamelessly transformed one of Disney's most horrifying villains into a sympathetic, compassionate caretaker, and now this total motivator, I have doubts that Jolie can commit to something that's (much) morally grayer in her artistic pursuits. This film tonally deceives you; while it presents us with truly disturbing scenes of torture and endless suffering (that almost becomes tedious in its uneventful repetition), Unbroken nonetheless sweeps you up from under your feet and tries to fill your heart with that final, last-minute dose of forceful effusiveness. What compelled me to keep my eyes on the screen throughout honestly wasn't the grandeur of the story but Jack O'Connell's magnificently transformative performance as Louis—a performance that exhibits despair, satisfying confidence, mania, optimism, and sometimes even near-defeat. Obviously not on equal ground with the sheer courageous strength of the man he's portraying, O'Connell still possesses his own strong-rooted (thespian) commitment that sees him losing a frightening amount of weight to bare bones less than mid-way into the narrative. The primary villain, Mutsuhiro Watanabe (aka 'The Bird'), is played very eccentrically by Japanese musician Miyavi. Watanabe is the central prison guard with an interestingly feminine appearance along with that deceptive soft voice of his. Of course, you can't deny the utterly monumental nature of this story and its structure as you're taken from one tremendously perilous and insurmountable predicament to another, from famished sharks to the desperate-to-win Japanese. The haplessness never ceases and only worsens. But 'a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,' so it seems and only proves to be true once everything is said and done and a legacy has been made out of Zamperini's adventurous lifetime. Some of the scenes here are almost too excessive in their long-winded suffering, seeming to drag on for too long, but it seems to be in the strength of the director to keep the pace and interest afloat. For instance, a scene that shows a group of people filing in a line to punch Louis real hard in the face for his misbehavior might seem like it'd eventually reach monotony, but the scene is edited and shot with impressive diversity (one shot focuses on Louis' failing posture and another on The Bird's fascinating expressions, and so on) to effectively maintain that drama. Another sequence, probably the best of the overall movie, sees an aerial battle as American soldiers, along with Louis, fend off fierce Japanese planes; it's all executed with a staying sense of tension and intrigue despite the occasional slowing of the pace. Now, on the other hand, the weakest link of the movie is surely its screenplay, which is unexpectedly disappointing considering that it was written by the Coen Brothers who, by the way, aren't really known for their affectionate writing—so, a very odd and unrecognizable choice there. Unbroken is littered with saccharine, fortune-cookie inspirational lines ('if you can take it, you can make it,' guys!) and unrealistic dialogue. If you can make an inspiring movie that feels more natural and convincing than simply emotionally manipulative, or frankly emotionally/psychologically simplistic, then you have some undeniable talent. This film, however, plays it very safe and formulaically; this tale is about forgiveness, religion, idealism— hardly something that sounds like it could be a little more subtle and restrained.",6,3,9,26 December 2014
Rear Window," Looking Through the Rear Window
","Hitchcock was a master of his craft- everyone is aware of that- and his ideas revolutionized and popularized the thriller genre, one of my personal favorites. Skimming through his rich filmography, every addition is fueled by unmatched suspense. This is no different with one of Hitchcock's highly-acclaimed classics, Read Window. The film promises so much potential with its opening act in which the camera is technically the first participant and onlooker as it manages to give us a considerable amount of backstory without any verbal language in its first five minutes or so. It carefully observes a fascinating environment/setting- one in which every neighbor's life is visible through their open windows. The way the set was built and is in appearance is simply genius and (almost) never was the set of a film as crucial to its story and themes as it is here. Right from the get-go, you witness an underlying theme in that this picture conveys the isolated and individualistic nature of neighborhoods in our current world. No one seems to be interested in their neighbors besides Jeff (and he even mentions this in one of his clever lines) so much so that they aren't even concerned about what they're actually partaking in those rooms of theirs; the neighbors are never aware anyways. However, on the opposite side, it can be argued that people in current society are frankly too obsessed with another's conversation or activities. Apparently, we stick our noses in everyone's business, and it can be argued on a political scale as well. We do, in fact, watch our foreign neighbors far too closely with invasive binoculars, and in this manner, Jeff could actually be perceived as the villain of Rear Window in a way. In sum, there are countless perspectives one can judge this film from, occasionally conflicting with one another due to their opposing scopes. Anyways, I can't place my eye on the exact reason, but actors were so much more capable of delivering with a charming character back in those days because the audience immediately recognizes the charisma of the film's protagonist as he daringly speaks out with clever, hilarious, and/or downright convincingly serious lines. His lovable personality is loud and clear with the story's development, and eventually, it's met with the beauty of Grace Kelly's character (Lisa). On a side note, as the intriguing plot progressed, the whole idea undoubtedly reminded me of Disturbia (2007). Moving on, albeit its heavily suspenseful and compelling nature, there were some faults I happened to identify. First of all, did the entire case really mean that much to Jeff to the point where he just couldn't bring himself to yell out when Lisa, his future wife, was endangered by Mr. Thorwald's intimidating and threatening presence? There was a sense of awkwardness in that I was viewing this curious fellow experiencing anxiety with visible sweat pouring down his face though he still continues to watch on as his love nears possible death. In addition, the result of this riveting mystery felt somewhat anticlimactic, and this slightly stemmed from the expectations one usually possesses upon viewing a Hitchcock film for there is usually a twist that shocks and awes the audience towards its end. We never got that from Rear Window as everything was exactly as it seemed. It could've been the main point of the feature, but still, I predicted the garden being the burial spot of the poor woman in the movie's first hour. And if the message of the film was that everything is truly as it seems, then why did another theme intrude the ending where you see a short, fat lover show up at the breathlessly gorgeous model's apartment? There and then, it seemed as if not everything is what it seems; so, already you have two contradictory (possible) themes on your plate. Which one was Hitchcock's actual intention? After all is said and done, Rear Window is a fantastic thriller with a not-as-satisfying end result, but it definitely impressed me the way most Hitchcock films have already. (North by Northwest is definitely next on my list.)",7,2,4,30 September 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," 'The Best Tween Movie' Is Not Really Saying Much
","I'll preface the review for Catching Fire by firstly saying that I absolutely disliked the first entry ('hate' might be too strong of a word to use in this case). At the end of the day, this series is a light version of similar, but much more brutal, stories (Battle Royale, for example), which is why it's just a YA adaptation and nothing more. Catching Fire promised a darker and more unforgiving tone, and it succeeded in some respect. Whereas the first film felt like a cheesy film for innocent teenagers (especially once we arrive at the tedious hunger games), this one finally builds some intrigue and substance by introducing the whole political realm behind this world, focusing on the corruption and the manipulation of its people therein. In fact, there are incredibly resonant and strong themes that could be find throughout the film. For instance, the act of constantly providing coverage on a very popular celebrity- the people eat it up- and in the meantime, the Capitol is able to get away with the evil that's practiced behind the doors. The entire concept draws quite noticeable parallels to our contemporary world as the 99% concentrate on Jennifer Lawrence's new look or her recent interviews at the last red carpet, completely forgetting their lowly stature in current society. See, it takes all the attention off of the government's wrongdoings. So, hopefully, its core demographic (teenagers living within conservative families) actually take note of these analogies and find something more in this 'tween flick' other than the usual fare you'll discover in the standard young adult novels. Anyways, a considerable portion of the film actually centers on this fascinating premise until we leave all the meaningful material (the filmmakers, at that point, recalling that this is a Hollywood movie and there needs to be action for the sake of entertaining the teens) by straying into the predictable, boring, and excessively prolonged section that is the hunger games. The hunger games should be the whole point of the movie, right? Unfortunately, it's an atrocious point nonetheless. Again, this motion picture is another YA (young adult) adaptation that is heavily toned and dumbed down for the pure teens and kids who're seeing this as the darkest and most brutal film they've ever witnessed. The entire hunger games sequence is utterly predictable (which was one of the greatest issues I had with its predecessor). No one of real significance meets death; they all conveniently survive the dangers of these games. I'll even go out on a limb and say no major character is going to die by the end of the series. Apparently, the audience would be traumatized if their favorites didn't manage to escape the island, which really makes the games fairly superfluous. Look, with such a dour concept, I really need to be seeing an abundance of blood, death, and hopelessness (you're all probably gasping by now). Otherwise, it's sheer pointlessness and doesn't deliver on what it clearly promises. As if that wasn't a transparent indicator of a YA feature, we thankfully get another forced (teenagers eat this up, which I frankly find laughable) love triangle. Can we, for once, have a female protagonist that's serious and determined to solve the conflict without involving herself in some unneeded romance with generic pretty boys? If females really don't take issue with this element, that is probably why there aren't a lot of particularly memorable females in cinema when compared to the amount of male badasses. Seriously, if every female character is a total slut, I'm not going to look up to them, and I certainly won't like them. (The feminist movement will be on me anytime soon now.) Do even the female badasses really- really- have to deal with this teenage angst bullsh*t? When we're looking at the performances, I found Phillip Seymour Hoffman a definite highlight as he frequently is. I might be in the minority here, but Jennifer Lawrence is just trying too hard at this point. She tries to fill her performances with overly dramatic scenes (incessantly crying, screaming for five minutes, etc.). Perhaps, it's the actor's own willingness to expose herself so often- through every interview and red carpet appearance- that I just don't find her that convincing when she enables her 'I'm an Oscar-winning actress' mode. A lot of the other characters are terribly bland, but I enjoyed Woody Harrelson's and Elizabeth Bank's performances on the other hand. Furthermore, and somewhat most importantly, the movie is just too long, especially once it hits the hunger games, which seem to drag on forever. All in all, the only interesting aspect of this film was emphasized in its first hour (even then, there's an artificial love triangle subplot tossed in there) and probably the only intelligent content you'll find in any YA adaptation. Yes, the narrative is beautifully shot- I'll give it that- eliminating the distracting shaky-cam action from the first one, but that only marginally improves the film's quality when you're required to deal with a principally uninteresting storyline. If you're a fanboy of the books, you'll probably end up enjoying the film as you did the first one (I suspect that's why these two movies have been getting such unusually high praise). If you're not, you'll likely end up uttering the phrase 'Battle Royale with cheese' at least once.",5,14,27,20 December 2013
Godzilla," Half Effective Disaster Film, Half Monsters-fighting Nerds' Movie
","Monster movies have been around since the dawn of Hollywood, but it's only now that they're gradually transforming into superhero movies as well because—as you all know—we're facing a drought of those. In this case, Godzilla starts off as a terrific tense disaster film that actually forced my mouth open at one point. The film cleverly keeps the first hour mysterious, refraining from showing too much of the monster or its background. Nerdy Godzilla fanboys might be complaining, but it's a very wise decision that definitely maximizes the impact of its first appearance. In fact, the movie started resembling 2005's King Kong and the Jurassic Park series with its initial reluctance to delve straight into the monster's destruction. Instead, we're introduced to the narrative's main characters and how they all tie into the big picture. Now, some might be underwhelmed by the 'dullness' of these characters as some critics noted, but a 2-hour film that's predominantly focusing on a daunting creature can only do so much. It can stretch out to be 3 hours and both develop its characters and primary monster like King Kong (2005) did, but you all would still be whining. In my opinion, most of the actors do a good job with the material they're provided to work with—Bryan Cranston, as usual, showing his A-game and starting to separate himself from his famous role as Heisenberg. The film's concentration on its characters in the first half also allows for effective scenes that lead to the deaths of fairly significant individuals. As a result, the audiences are thus able to feel the danger of the whole situation with the establishment of greater suspense for the later acts on whether or not a certain character might die in a particular sequence. The tone, in large part, retains grittiness and a dark, hopeless aura sets in, which thankfully means moviegoers won't have to deal with forced humor throughout as we all know the mandate for summer blockbusters usually demands. With that being said, yes, this movie is an exceptional Godzilla film that intelligently builds the behemoth up for his first (chilling) appearance and from that moment on, all havoc is unleashed. Destruction befalls on every major city and millions of citizens perish underneath the rubble—everything that also makes for a fine disaster film at its foundation. Like I earlier mentioned, there are some highly tense, blood-curdling segments indeed, and in addition, a group of innocent kids are occasionally seen in the middle of it, thereby further fueling viewers' apprehension. On the other hand, no, Godzilla isn't perfect because it still suffers from its fair share of flaws as a film. First of all, Aaron Taylor Johnson, definitely the lead of the film, somehow persistently maintains his composure and remains reserved like a standard tough guy even when colossal monsters near to such a close distance that they can very well devour him in the split of a second. Seriously, I'd be screaming my lungs out, but of course, only the females in the movie are shrieking. For some reason, the kids in most films stereotypically gasp at some 'cool' real-life action rather than crying for mommy and daddy. What?! I don't think that's how real adolescents behave. A lot of the kids in this film simply stare at all the horrific chaos with a demeanor of amazement, wowing at the sight of explosions in close proximity. It's a very superficial display of reality, as is usual with Hollywood blockbusters, in the midst of a story that's otherwise attempting to portray terror through reasonable realism. And then, I really have to ask: is Godzilla just King Kong 2.0? Herein, we're supposed to feel sympathy for the Brobdingnagian force because he's yet another superhero who breathes florescent fire and extricates humans from other scary monsters. Along the vein of popular superheroes like Batman and Spider-Man, he immediately comes to the rescue whenever there's any hint of a notable character in jeopardy. With or without the gargantuan monster's aid, some characters are still conveniently spared from immense danger even though everyone else around them is essentially doomed. See, what occurs in the movie that first posed as a despairing disaster film of monumental proportions is a noticeable tonal shift in its last act. It's decently realistic and gloomy at first only to suddenly reshape into a Pacific Rim 2.0, offering us a few grandiose Kaiju battles. Given the fact that I haven't seen the original Godzilla pictures, I entered the theater hoping that this would turn out to be a 'humans versus Godzilla' movie, but that would ultimately mean unstoppable obliteration. The filmmakers basically took the easy route out and ensured the security of a happy ending. After all has been said and done, I believe a recommendation for this film would be fair as its first hour and a half is nicely constructed and depicted for it's as good of a Godzilla film as we could ever possibly get. Keep in mind, though, that its two hours, overall, do seem unusually lengthy for some odd reason.",6,3,6,20 May 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," The Sad Reality of Show Business
","Wow. Honestly, I'm still touched by this pure work of cinema. It's quite a pessimistic and depressing- albeit very honest- depiction of the lives led by the people who aspire to be something greater than an average employee for a corporation. In this case, we have an impeccably talented folk musician named Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) who's not exactly in the best of circumstances, considering his impoverished state and exhausted soul. Folk music has never been an overly popular genre, and his struggles prove the unfairness within dreamers' lives. Right from the get-go, we understand that Davis has been doing this for a while now. Unfortunately, he's not making a living off of participating in that which he absolutely loves and is spending every night at another friend's or relative's residence. His willingness to endure the hardships that plague his unlucky life (rather than fall back on something that's more financially sound) is undoubtedly appreciable. The sad truth certainly should touch anyone who's looking to involve themselves in the entertainment industry, specifically, for quality (as can be seen here) is oftentimes disregarded as the majority of the public are drawn to simpler and more crowd-pleasing material. For instance, as I observed my surroundings in the theater room, I realized that not many people sat in the audience. That right there, folks, is the sad reality of the entertainment business, proving the lack of recognition of sheer quality in general as we're frequently distracted by the more extravagant productions that lead you from one intense situation to another. As I was originally stating, the pop and hip-hop music reign supreme while the intelligence found in tamer and more lyrics-based tunes is inequitably overshadowed. And rather than eventually permeate this clever picture with heartwarming events and Hollywood-izing the ending, the Coen Brothers remain ruthless in their brutally honest and genuine portrayal of a struggling individual who I largely sympathized with. Davis's road ahead and behind is wretched, and you're forced to see him run into an adverse incident after another as if someone completely cursed him once in some unimaginable way. His behavior initially might bother some viewers, but as you witness the cruel and unforgiving individuals around him and the harsh environment- I, at least, definitely understood his persistently hostile attitude and mindset. He's not the 'asskisser' who finds success in the industry by forming connections here and there and sleeping around elsewhere; he limply carries along with his integrity and dignity in tact. The filmmakers wisely never compromise in order to implement some superficial element to his character so as to present a more likable side. Anyways, being that this is primarily a character-driven narrative, Oscar Isaac's performance is surely crucial to how the final product turns out. Fortunately, he's unquestionably phenomenal- I've got to love and appreciate the subtle performances as opposed to the showy and 'Oscar-baity' paths that lots of actors seem to take in these kinds of films. No, Isaac is so capable in his role that you can't help but admire this miserable character as he proceeds along on his inauspicious journey. I found everything from his low-key mannerisms to the overall hesitant and reserved personality (especially when in the company of loud-mouthed or more enthusiastic people) incredible and utterly convincing. Of course, I have to vastly rave about the film's amazingly beautiful and unique cinematography. To me, it seemed pastel-like, for lack of a better term, in a sense and borrowed a grayish, or predominately colorless, visual style. Throughout its duration, we're introduced to particularly darkened rooms, pervaded by rising smoke and an attentive crowd in a respectfully silent atmosphere- occasionally, we sight the light illuminating one side of the room while the other side remains desolate and gloomy. In essence, the Coen Brothers always know how to showcase the most stunning of camera-work, and speaking of traditional Coen Bros. strengths, the writing also keeps us highly invested throughout the numerous enthralling encounters and dispiriting conversations Davis runs into on his mentally gruesome adventure. All in all, Inside Llewyn Davis is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films of 2013 (it expanded nationwide in early 2014, which is why I'm writing the review this late). Notice how I haven't even covered any weaknesses of the film. Guess why? Because there are none, and usually, Hollywood pictures disappoint me with their endings in that unnaturally happy or unnecessary fashion. Like I said, this film, however, refrains from sacrificing its artistic integrity as the melancholy tone never subsides. If you love the art of cinema and treasure the passionate filmmakers that still allow for clever projects like this to be made, go see Inside Llewyn Davis!",10,1,5,10 January 2014
Her," Sci-Fi That's Smaller But Far More Superior
","First of all, I'm incredibly glad to see such an unconventional and original story (that wasn't based off of yet another novel) in this day and age. What can definitely be found in this film is an incredibly fascinating concept. Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) lives in the future where technology is ever more convenient- doing everything you want it to at the utterance of a few words- and the newest addition introduces any who're interested to an OS that's able to serve as a romantic companion, deeply discussing the way of the world with you and engaging in phone sex when the arousal starts to sink in. It makes you think of how much more comfortable or widely different the future will be from the present day. The idea of virtual companions might not suit everyone, but the idea, in and of itself, is undoubtedly intelligent and complex nonetheless. This partner is void of any imperfections that plague the common female (or male); it knows you inside out and can converse about the subjects you actually enjoy. Consequently, the quantity of argument is dramatically reduced and the sound of genuine laughter and sheer joyousness permeates in its stead. Now, the more shallow and insensitive of individuals might find such an idea highly bothersome and strange, but in essence, this picture attempts to question the boundaries of love. Does love have to be inextricably conventional and tied to the societal norms like everything else in this world? I admire the fact that these characters, for once in a Hollywood production and this mightily perverted society, didn't get right down to sex. There's much more to love than the sexual intercourse- something that might act equally as sensational. Of course, the hard-hearted alpha males will laugh at such talk, but the romantic and truly loving will adore its implications. Throughout the movie's duration, we see the impressive amount of comfort and intimacy shared between Theodore and his OS/computer (Samantha, played by Scarlett Johansson). Like with the 'Before' trilogy, Her shows the most heartwarming of relationships: when the couple actually get along verbally and share each other's profound knowledge of the fascinating aspects of life. Right then and there, you sight the authenticity and their pleasure for each other's company. A narrow-minded individual would quickly realize the impossibility of having sex with this entity and tend elsewhere. With this rapidly-developing relationship, the audience is able to discern the fundamental depths of true love. Anyways, Joaquin Phoenix, once again, proves why he's one of the most talented actors in the business today- a terrific performance. I absolutely love how this guy can transform into anyone- from a nefarious tyrant to a deranged, lost soul and now to a sweet and wholly goodhearted dude. The role of Samantha is arguably Johansson's finest showing- her variegated and vehement voice, as it stands alone, proves that Johansson is a perfectly capable actress. The screenplay, in addition, allows for the richness and delightful unraveling of this unorthodox relationship. Quite popularly this year, I discovered a fair share of humor in this smart narrative. Honestly, I was continually cracking up during its first half before it took on a more dramatic tone in order to address the serious thematic material behind this entire notion. Though I found it faltering in its second half, I was persistently amused and engrossed in its first half as we begin to learn of how this distant future exactly functions and are introduced to the fascinating machine that suddenly slips into Theodore's life. Furthermore, though on a much smaller scale, like with Cuaron's Children of Men, a whole new type of world (immensely metropolitan and urbanized) is created and (cleverly) deliberately revealed thanks to Jonze's ingenious vision. With all that praise being given, I have to reiterate how disappointed I was with its closing minutes. For one, I didn't appreciate the slightly 'Hollywood-ized' and seemingly unnatural ending. I won't go into spoilers (as much as I loved to talk more in-depth in reviews, I obviously can't), but it was exactly what I was expecting. You knew where these particular characters would end up at the end of the story, and so, I found that somewhat uninspired and compromising. The theme, if I'm right, felt simplistic (compared to the abstract nature the premise of the film promised). I also didn't agree with what the film seemed to be saying about this entire image after presenting a fairly balanced voice on the state of relationships and the various paths they're allowed to take. During its running, you could clearly detect the negatives and positives of dating a normal human being versus a virtual partner and the other way around. Its ending just wasn't as memorable and satisfying as the rest of the film seemed to be indicating. At the end of the day, I found Her to be a breath of fresh air in the sci-fi realm (its execution of the genre far superior to any of the bombastic 100-million-dollar blockbusters this year) - remarkably magnificent in its world-building, featuring an unbelievably pleasing tale (at first), and forcing us to question the conventionality of society's idea of love and relationships in general.",8,2,4,11 January 2014
