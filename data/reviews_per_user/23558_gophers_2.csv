Catch Me If You Can," extremely overrated
","This movie was quite weak. The only reason people are raving about this flick is because it was directed by Steven Spielberg. I mean, come on, Adventures of Pluto Nash was smarter than this. Tom Hanks and Martin Sheen have really embarrassing roles here. Skip this and go see Gangs of New York. It's directed by this guy named Martin Scorsese who desserves much more attention.",Null,0,1,21 January 2003
Gladiator," Good movie.........but
","This was hands down a beautiful looking movie, but Russell Crowe didn't deserve that oscar he got. Over a year later, I'm still trying to figure out why they gave it to him over Ed Harris or Tom Hanks. Joaquin Phoenix really shines as Commodus and the cinematography and score are great. But was that whole opening battle really necessary.",Null,0,1,3 April 2002
