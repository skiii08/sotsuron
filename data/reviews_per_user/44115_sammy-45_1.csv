Scarface," Dynamic Pacino
","Pacino is not just an actor,he is above that. I have seen many movies in my life but when you justify an actor you must put under consideration that an acting is an expression of an indivudal's personality that has been portrait in a natural way. Al Pacino knows the best how to do that. When Pacino acts it does not seem that he is acting rather it looks the real person who molded one hundred percent in Pacino's blood and that I call acting.If Hollywood feels proud about their actors then Pacino will be top of the list. In Scarface, I can not distinguish between Pacino and Tony Montana, they are same as far the acting goes.",Null,0,0,27 June 1999
