Deepwater Horizon," Expressing a real tragedy
","This movie was great in showing the disaster happened in April 20,2010 intially and was followed by oil spill in Gulf of Mexico for a few months! the movie clearly shows what happened and why this happened. I just saw this movie and I enjoyed it. during the movie the crew on oil rig ran a negative test( a test which basically is done before the mission starts to see if the pipes can handle the pressure and if there is any pressure on the main pipe). They say that there is a huge pressure on the main pipe but the coordinators on this event asked them to run this mission anyways without really think of how dangerous the situation is. What worst is the manager of the crew team (the one who has to give the crew permission to start the mission) thought that pressure would be okay. He was under the pressure of supervisors because the project was behind about 51 days. So they started pumping up the oil and eventually the pressure built up and pipes broke down. massive amount of pressure was on pipes and oil started flowing out. following this the generators started to work faster than normal and the heat they produced made a massive fire and then a explosion and one second later the whole rig was on fire. the movie pictured all these events just fine and what is sad is that 11 crew members lost their lives and about 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled out in the ocean. It was the greatest tragedy in oil industry for the U.S. I personally recommend to definitely watch this movie.",8,0,0,9 February 2020
