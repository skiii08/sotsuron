Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Toilet joke city
","There is some humor in this comedy, mostly within the first half hour. But it fails badly after a while with the ceaseless toilet jokes. This is a one theme film: an eastern European yokel comes to America and exposes all of its pretensions and foibles. Borat is rude and crude; he seems intent on insulting everyone, but especially such easy targets as southern yahoos, patriots (the attack on the war in Iraq is predictable), traditional morality, good manners, and civilized life in general. For that, Borat is praised by viewers as being politically incorrect. Just the opposite is true, in my opinion.If potty humor is your thing, this film is for you. Grownups and sophisticated teenagers should find better things to do than celebrate the repulsive.",2,4,8,21 April 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Juvenile fun
","Here we have the second sequel to the pretty good action film Die Hard. This is over two hours of non-stop running, chasing, cursing, screaming, hitting, driving crazily, shooting, and killing. It's guaranteed to satisfy 15-year-old males of all ages. Bruce Willis smirks a lot, and Jackson curses a lot. And both ran wildly around, attempting to placate and defeat a mad antagonist. Some of the stunts are truly absurd, such as attempting to get from a tall bridge onto a ship moving below and filled with villains. And Willis is beaten up so badly in the course of this single day (according to the script) that one wonders how he could possibly walk let alone spit out one-liners and beat up bad guys. The bad guys are blondish, fiendish Germans. How predictable it all is.",5,0,1,1 March 2006
Mr. Holland's Opus," Heart-warming but flawed
","This is a lovely film, designed successfully to bring tears to the eyes of everyone seeing it. The acting is superb all the way around. Dreyfuss is a wonder. But there are quite a few historical flaws (see the goof section on this film) and mistakes. The lack of synchronization between the musicians and the music is maddening. The caliber of playing is far too high for the age-level of the players in the later stages of the film. And the absolutely stunning Jean Louisa Kelly was too old and too good to be a high school student. (She had recently graduated from Columbia University.) The film is also too long. A treacly bit about a black student who lacked rhythm and then died in Vietnam could easily have been skipped. By the way, at the funeral, the parents of the young man are shown in mourning. But sitting next to them, ostensibly a relative, is a young woman who is smiling during both shots of the family. That's the kind of carelessness that marred this otherwise fine film. One more thing: teachers will know that it isn't that easy to win the hearts and minds of young people. Mr. Holland as an educator must have doing things off camera.",8,3,6,1 June 2007
The Sixth Sense," Sensitivity Plus
","There is a lot of sensitive acting in this film.  People look off into space a lot.  Women bawl and sputter.  The head kid whimpers and cries. Spooks run across the screen, no doubt thrilling all the thirteen-year-olds in the theater.  And at the end, our hero was dead all along.  Which could certainly have fooled his wife.Seven cents is too much to pay to see the Sixth Sense.",5,2,3,30 June 2000
The Matrix," A dud, designed strictly for 15-year-olds.
","Anyone over 15 (either chronologically or mentally) should find this film a grave disappointment.  Endless chase scenes, destruction, murder, and mayhem.  The plot makes no sense at all.  The actors are wholly wooden. Two stars--for the special effects people.",2,2,8,14 October 1999
Gladiator," Ho hum
","The lead reviewer, who thinks this is one of the two greatest films ever made, must not have seen many films.  Crowe, a sort of uninteresting Richard Burton, is Shane--the little good guy who beats up and kills all the bad guys.  The film itself, designed for teens, is a mixture of pro wrestling and sentimentality.  The religious aspect is laughable.  The political correctness is boring.Better to see The Robe, with the real Richard Burton.",5,0,1,4 March 2001
