The Ring," One of the best I've seen
","This movie crept up on me as I watched it and I still haven't been able to shake it off...five days later.  It's subtle, and if you go in expecting a slasher film or a gore-fest, you will be disappointed.  If you're in the mood for creepy, suffocating dread and horror infused into everyday objects, then go see it.A lot of people who prefer the Japanese original say this version explains too much; some Americans say it doesn't explain enough.  It doesn't come right out and explain everything, but the answers are there if you look.I saw this movie at a 1:30 matinee, and halfway through, I had completely forgotten that the sun was shining outside.  And when I left the theater, the sunlight seemed utterly irrelevant to what I'd witnessed.  There's horror in this film that nothing can stop -- if you like stylish horror, treat yourself to this one.",9,0,0,1 November 2002
