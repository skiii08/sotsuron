National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Sugarcoated adventure for family viewing
","I really liked the first movie with these characters but I got frustrated with this sequel. I was expecting much more intelligent puzzles and breathtaking adventure. Instead this movie is a perfect example of a sugarcoated adventure for family viewing in a lazy Saturday night in DVD in pijamas snacking microwave popcorn.The plot is weak and far from plausible. There are the iconic characters (the smart hero and his love/hate girlfriend, the funny hero's assistant, the divorced hero's parents, the bad but not so bad guy, the good cop and so on). It's too much cliché for a single movie for allowing it to be a good one.This definitely isn't a 'Top 10' adventure movie. It's OK for viewing with the kids and just it.",6,28,48,27 December 2007
Black Book," One of the best WWII movies I've ever seen
","I'm a fan of WWII movies since I was a boy and I must say this one is one of the best movies of the theme I've ever seen. If you like The Pianist you'll love this one too. Production is near perfect, characters are deep and intriguing, actors and actresses play very, very well and the history is very interesting. I think Verhoven got the perfect mix of all these ingredients to create a very good movie.It would be no surprise for me if this movies wins the Oscar because it really deserves it.This is one of the movies I'll buy the DVD to my collection and I dare to say few movies per year finds a place in my collection.",10,3,4,12 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Drowned in a deep ocean of confusion
",Just as most people I loved the first film because it was a fun and full of adventure honest pirates adventure movie. I like too much Cpt. Sparrow with his dandy-acid high manners and the seductive course around the treasure and the living dead bad pirates.The second movie was so-so but still interesting.But this third one is a a mess of plots inside plots inside plots with a Greek goddess and love all around. I must say I fell drowned in a deep ocean of confusion after watching this movie.I think the director/producers did a poor job trying to turn a funny adventure movie into a cerebral epic one.,5,1,2,10 February 2008
The Devil Wears Prada," You must watch this movie
","I like very much this movie. It's that kind of cool New York high style comedy/drama with a great soundtrack.The characters is very well built and have a lot of personality. Maryl Streep is great as Miranda, the 'satanic' editor of the fashion magazine and Anne Hataway is cute just as Audrey Hapburne in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'.I like too much the rhythm of the movie, it's fast, it's modern, it's like going to a cool dance club. Pay attention to the scene when Anne is walking from the street to the office and every cut shows her in a different clothing.",8,0,0,21 October 2006
I Am Legend," It could be better
","I was very curious about this movie after all the talk about it. After watching it I must say I expected a little more that it is.It's first half is quite boring just like the book which it is based. The second half it has more action but the ending of the movie is very, very different from the book and I prefer the book's ending instead.Will Smith play very well his movies. When I watched him years ago in Fresh Prince of Bell Air I would never expected him playing such a dense characters like the one in this movie so well. He did a really good job.Special Effects and scenarios is very nice. All the vampires are CGI (computer generated images) of course but it's very good.The ending is a little frustrating and I think it compromised the general result of the movie. It's ending is something like Independence Day's ending ... quite happy and full of hope. The ending of the book have intelligent vampires creating a new society and than contaminating the characters too for becoming part of their new society.Well, I think this movies worth the price of the ticket and I recommend it. It could be better but I'm thanks it's not so bad than some other movies around there.",6,1,2,22 December 2007
Children of Men," Great Movie
","I like too much SciFi stories in apocalyptic future and this movie is a great example of it. The plot of this movie is very actual e not so difficult to happened, a mix of pandemic and xenophobes.This movie has a quick rhythm that keeps the viewers turned on 220 volts since the start to the very end. The characters are very real and the actors play it very well.It's a dark movie, with dark cloudy sky and dark places. It's very militarist and shows a totalitarist government that resembles very much to the famous Orwell's 1984.I this this is one of the great movies of 2006 and it's from England, a proof that good movies can be made out of Hollywood. Worths the money for the theater ticket or the DVD rental.",10,6,10,17 December 2006
30 Days of Night," One of the nicest vampire movies I've ever seen
","I like too much vampire stories (books and movies) and this movie is one of the nicest I've ever seen. Actors play nice and makeup is very nice.OK it has some flaws, but it's common in any movies. The plot is intelligent and coherent with the location of the story. I like too much the play of the vampires, savage bloodthirsty vampires who hunts with cruelty, no 'blasè french like' vampires. There is a lot of blood and violence along the movie, both from vampires and human survivors.It's very nice the way the survivors run from the vampires, just like runaways in WWII movies.Some people would say the ending is something clichè, but I like it and I think it is perfect for this movie.",Null,1,2,1 December 2007
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Beautiful
","This movie is very beautiful. I love the photography, light and colors used along the scenes. It's a very good work that catches the eyes, really.Story is very interesting although quite boring in some parts. But it's not a problem at all. You'll enjoy it a lot if you like historic movies.The play of the actors is impressive. Kate Blanchet is perfect in this movie.I saw this movie before I knew it is a sequel of the another movie, Elizabeth, and I'm looking forward to watch this other one too.",7,0,1,30 December 2007
