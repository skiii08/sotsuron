Scarface," A Mobster movie about life in America for refuge's.
","'Scarface' is one of my favorite movies, along with Spartacus and The Godfather.  Al Pacino is such a terrific actor, especially the way he changes over the course of the movie.  Michele Pfeiffer is also terrific and so is Mary Elizabeth.  The script is amazing and the rest of the cast is as good as the one in 'The Godfather.'

The Patriot," The Patriot is a replica of Braveheart.
","The Patriot is a replica of Braveheart.  Mel Gibson was such a good actor when he was young, but now he's dumb.  Back when he made Braveheart, he was a good actor.  Now, he just wants to make cheap movies, all for the money. Now, to explain how it's a replica of Braveheart.  In Braveheart, they kill his wife and he gets revenge.  In Patriot, his children are killed and he gets revenge, every one of them dying at a different point.  In Braveheart, he starts a revolution and becomes a leader, and in the Patriot, he is also a leader and starts a revolution.  There's many more replica's, and if you have any questions, e-mail me at Braveheart1626@cs.com",1,6,12,2 September 2001
Lawrence of Arabia," A classic movie epic
","What sets this movie apart from other thought to be classics is that's it's a very long movie, but it explains T.E. Lawrence's life and the tragedies that followed.  I did watch the movie and I thought it was too long, but when I went and reviewed it in my mind, it was absolutely magnificent.  Of course it had to be long to portray such an amazing and courageous hero.",10,0,2,25 July 2001
Braveheart," Mel Gibson has to be realistic.
","To start off with, this film has many inaccuracies, but since many other users commented on that, I won't spend much time on that.  Rather, one of the major inaccuracies is of Sir William Wallace himself.  Gibson portrays him as a loving, sweet man, when in fact, when you want to free your country from tyranny, you can't have any of those personalities.  You have to kill, not negotiate.  Although William Wallace might have been sweet, he wasn't when he turned into a leader.  Anyways, Robert the Bruce wasn't a traitor, which is very disrespectful of Gibson.  I would suggest that Gibson and Randall Wallace, the idiotic writer, first read a biography of William Wallace called 'William Wallace: Braveheart,' by James MacKay.  Also, the only good thing about the movie is the acting, not by Gibson but by Patrick McGoohan, Edward I, Sophie Marceau, Queen Isabella and Angus MacFayden, Robert the Bruce.  Also, Catherine McCormack, Murron was terrific.",1,11,24,24 July 2001
