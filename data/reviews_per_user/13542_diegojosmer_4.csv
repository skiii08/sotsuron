First Man," Cinema at its best
","Damien Chazelle is one of the greatest current directors, and this movie just reaffirms that. First Man was such an incredible emotional and visual experience, that I'm amazed at how they did it.
Chazelle is my favorite director, and when First Man didn't get to any theatres on my city I was so disappointed. This is a movie that NEEDS to be seen on a big screen. Neil Armstrong isn't a character I'm really interested in, but this movie changed the way I saw him completely. Many of the critiques this movie had was that it was kind of 'emotionless', which I completely disagree in. Armstrong was such a reserved guy that this movie does a great job at studying his character and the way he sees and feel the world. The performances by Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy we're moving but also they have a lot of depth that is unraveled once you analyze the film after it's done.
The way this film is shot and edited gives it such a realistic feel that moments after the film ends you start to release this feeling of tension carried throughout the whole movie. Some criticized that it is too 'shaky' but that's an aspect I loved. I saw many interviews with Chazelle where he talks about the whole filming process and the way he interpreted the story is transmitted with the filming style. He wanted to create a documentary like film that showcased the life of Armstrong as well as the risks of the space race, and working with the DP he achieved it. The space launch sequences gave me an anxiety lever that I've never felt in a space movie before.
I truly could continue to talk about how great this movie is, but you just need to experience it in order to understand. I cannot wait to see what this incredible director does next.",10,2,5,11 January 2019
Spotlight," Deserving of All the Awards
","Spotlight is such an important and powerful film. This is the story of a team of Boston Globe journalists who discovered how the church was hiding many pedophile priests giving them no real punishments. This film won Best Picture about three years ago and it totally deserved it. What makes this movie so great is that it decided to showcase the complete journalism process, the way we start to see our four reporters start to uncover the truth is amazing. It's not about the drama or the personal struggles of a particular character, it's about how a journalist does his or her job, and why it's important. Apart from that, it doesn't shy away from the subject matter of pedophiles. On one particular scene Sacha, the character amazingly played by Rachel McAdams, says: 'Language is going to be really important here. The word 'molest' isn't going to be enough'. And that's totally it, we get the hard and difficult truth of the actual events that happened with no sugarcoating.
The overall look and tone of the film was beautiful, there are a couple shots that took my breath away. And this top level of filmmaking complements the top level acting from the whole ensemble.
This movie is so real it actually terrifies me about the situation they uncovered. It's the truth, which can be really hard and disturbing, but it's the whole truth.",8,2,3,6 January 2019
Aquaman," Probably the only one
","So yesterday I got the chance to see Aquaman, and I truly did not know what to expect. I had only seen the first trailer, but went into the theatre since I really enjoy DC/Marvel/Superheroe movies. Unfortunately this movie just wasn't it for me.
The main driving factor is the screenplay, or mainly the way the plot was taken care of. The beginning of the movie really threw me off since there was almost no exposition of the characters. I'm aware Aquaman and Mera were technically introduced in Justice League, but that doesn't change the fact that I think a couple of minutes to further present the character interactions would've helped.
Then there's the fact that I felt that some of the action sequences just threw too much into the situation. The film is a great achievement of CGI and Visual Effects, but sometimes less is best. And I'm not talking about the Atlantian effects, because those were perfect and stunning, I mostly refer to the last action sequence where the writers mostly knew the studio would give them millions of dollars, so they decided to go all in.
I applaud James Wan for presenting the underwater scenes in such an amazing way but the 'real-world' scenes needed to showcase the same amount of quality as the underwater ones, which left the movie feeling really unbalanced.
Something that had never happened to me is being irritated by the score/soundtrack. I think the score did not know exactly what it wanted to do with the movie, and there was no real consistency with the way it wanted to musicalize the film. What was truly absurd was how in the middle of the movie after an intense and big action sequence they decided to throw in an upbeat Pitbull song. I started laughing out loud because I couldn't believe they decided to include that.This movie just didn't work to me as a whole and I got tired in the middle of the movie because of how much was happening. If you're a fan of superheroe movies and love those big budget all in action sequences, then you probably will leave the theatre really satisfied.",3,5,22,14 December 2018
Up in the Air," Amazing Cast and Direction
","I watched Up in the Air because I'm a big fan of Anna Kendrick and wanted to see the role she has earned the most praise for in her whole career. I must admit that it did not disappoint. Apart from the great performances by our 3 leads, one of the things I loved about this movie was the directing. Jason Reitman, who also co-wrote the script, has a really great way to capture intimate and tender moments between characters. The story is all about connection, and the directing of the movie captured that. There is particularly one sequence at the end, the wedding (for those who've seen it), that was shot beautifully. That whole sequence wasn't about getting those cinematic artistic shots, but about capturing the emotion the actors are showing. The only problem I have with this movie was that I believe the ending could have been fleshed out a little bit more. The resolution to the arc of our main character wasn't really there for me. Nonetheless this was a movie I deeply enjoyed and want to see again to try and analyze the story and performances better.",8,0,0,20 December 2018
