Deja Vu," The most emotional roller-coaster and thought provoking ride I have EVER experienced!
","Before I saw this film, my favorite film of all time was without a doubt TOP GUN.Tony Scott was the best director of our time - FACT.
Denzil Washington is without a doubt one of the finest actors of our time and it shows in almost every movie he is in.I am a guy and I cannot think of another film that has me completely choked up and tears in my eyes which the final scene of this movie does, EVERY TIME I WATCH IT !!!",10,0,0,8 February 2019
