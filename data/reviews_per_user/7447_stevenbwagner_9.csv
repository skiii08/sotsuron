It," A Most messy and unconvinced and unconventional mess!
",It starts up nice but quickly comes to what genre cliches that horror Filmmakers have to offer today the film is messy through out the movie with very over used with Jump-scares the is not just jump-scares It's one the same jump scare after the next with no tension suspense that will lead up to dread the director has alternative ideas based on the novel but sticks to firmly on the spirit without much concern for the voice of the author the film has been better off if sticking to the voice of the author like other king adaptions like Shawshank redemption and The Green Mile and the director Andy cannot really grab on to the mall source material or did genre very well he be better off directing dark fancy or Goth fantasy type films but here it's one too many messes one of the big problems was the first director CJ funkaga had The Goonies meets a horror film type movie witch does not work here and it makes me and other people sick that filmmakers coming in the business today are trying to have one goal and that is how can we jump cheats jump scare everyone without using suspense tension or dread or even surprise over suspense or silence Andy's version uses a pennywise that uses chili quality which is not real relevant to the book and looks over cliched and adds too much of the prosthetics it went better than using less it went better than using less is more some filmmakers don't seem to understand that today while the trial equality May been an interesting idea but definitely does not hold up from what the book had to offer which was a middle-aged man in a clown costume hopefully the next adoption 20 years of self and now we'll have ma much more visual look in this version has this version can't grab hold much and the reason why it has such a respected audience membership is because this film is not going to impress big main going moviegoers a man impressed critics but it's going to fail to impress serious or any kind of serious going audiences,1,0,4,29 July 2019
Hereditary," Not much here
",Hereditary opens up with alot of promise in But eventually the film becomes slow pacing boring and eventually becomes a want able disturbing Horror flick the inspires to be the next exorcist but the film lacks pacing character development the film may has critically acclaimed reviews but this movie really fails to even impress serious Horror fans as well serious movie goers,1,1,7,1 September 2019
The Terminator," One of Camerons best
","Terminator has both originality great action,Chase and enough story and character to keep you hooked",10,3,4,11 November 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A excellent Thriller
",A excellent film adapted from the swedish novel it hooked from beginning to end and you'll be able to watch again,10,1,3,2 September 2019
The Exorcist," One way trip into fear or hell
",The exorcist brings more then you would expect and this film will make you question your faith and is your faith strong enough the film relies on fear and evil tension and suspense this truly is one of the most scariest films that you will remember forever in your soul,10,0,0,16 June 2019
It Follows," Unfocused opening
",After one or two minutes into the movie it fails to have focused opening after two minutes I found myself turning it off,1,1,3,5 September 2019
A Quiet Place," Promising yet cannot fulfill its promise
",Quiet place opens up real nice and promising but quickly becomes a genre cliche being more thriller than horror by the end when the monsters weakness is discovered it becomes cheap and unnecessary the film has few problems with its characters and ending the film lacks a backstory and a advantage to change yet while I won't give out the ending but the ending is rather stupid by the end Ariana time to face the creatures but in a way how they figure out it's just stupid and we sent before director john krasinski can't grab on much,3,1,4,4 July 2019
Rosemary's Baby," A Eriee opening and Carry's on
",One of the probably best Horror Films of the 1960s and better than the films today based on the novel I haven't read the novel but from what I heard the book is just as good as the movie Polanski created a brilliant Horror Film the casting is excellent the cinematography great for it's time it's better when adapting a novel relying on the voice of the author over the spirit you rely on the voice you can create something original while sticking to the spirit means usually starting from scratch which doesn't work very well anymore,10,0,0,5 September 2019
It Chapter Two," a sinking mess
",The movie has more problems then the first the movie opens where the first left off and like the first film relys very heavy on cheap jump scares and unfaithal to kings source material the film relys on over humor unlikeable charactors underdevoloped charactors and the charactors lack of chemistry as the film goes on it becomes boring uncovencing and by the finale is a huge let down by the end you don't care what happened on screen like the first film has no suspene no tension or dread just a cheap attement to scare people in the worst way this movie as well as the first is a let down for fans of king and the novels fans 1/10,1,1,3,25 November 2019
