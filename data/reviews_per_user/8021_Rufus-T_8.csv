The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Deep subtle but perplexing movie that lacks the punch
","Like the other Kieslowski films, the film do not offer much entertainment value but philosophical value. After listening to the audio commentary, I realize this is even more complicated film than I thought.I wasn't bored by it, but rather, perplexed. Knowing that it is Kieslowski film, instead tried to grab on to find its concept, I let the scenes express themselves as they are. I did have a haunting feeling through out the film, especially through the 'green or red' dim mood coloring. It was intimate, yet mysterious surreal. Annette Insdorf's audio commentary of the Criterion Collection DVD did point out many connecting details and thoughts that did not revealed to me in my first viewing.After some more thoughts, I started to think that this movie really did fail to hold the audience in 2 ways: 1) Krzysztof Kieslowski: Although this movie is deeper than the eyes can see, it is even less entertaining movie than his others that I'd watched. The intrigue went as far as the movie title. After that all the clues are so obscured that without a guide, it is a total 'perplex'. He had put so much effort into placing clues that he neglected to keep his audience. Granted, his meticulousness I do appreciate. Appreciating is different from enjoying. Green mix red is not an appealing color either, unlike the captivating colors in the three color trilogy.2) Irene Jacob: She is truly one of the most beautiful actress in the last few decades. The movie showed the full array of her beauty and the glory of her curves, not to mention the full blown of her eroticism. However, I can't find her performance inspiring. This is an expressive movie, and it is essential that the leading character express convincingly, i.e. Irene Jacob alone by herself, which I did not find her successfully do although I have to say quite a load for her to carry playing 2 characters. A movie I think I can compare with is Wong Kar-Wai's 'In the Mood of Love'. That movie would have been totally dull if Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung did not have their a great performance which I thought they had. I did not think Irene Jacob was tremendous either in Red though much better performance that this one. I thought Krzysztof Kieslowski did made Red interesting. Maybe I found that Irene Jacob is an overrated actress (was she ever considered as a good actress?), or perhaps Kieslowski is not the right director for her.It doesn't take away my appreciation of the grandeur spiritual message that I found in this movie, nor will it stops me from further watching Kieslowski's other movies, not at all. This is not a movie I would recommend to everyone, but a movie worth the while to be studied.",7,2,8,20 March 2007
Spider-Man 3," Disappointed and deceived by the trailer. Still worth seeing for the action
","Overall I did enjoy it, but quite a big let down after the fantastic Spider-man 2. From the trailer, I thought spidey fighting his dark self was the main theme of the sequel, which would have been terrific. It turned out that self-conflict portion wasn't that a big part of the story afterall. The goo falling out of the sky was very interesting. I would have like to know more about it, where it comes from, and the way that it bring the darkside of someone. Well, maybe in SM4. I felt that actor was not a good choice to play Venom. I can't find hatred in that face, or just bad acting. Another problem I find is that this one has more lame dialogues than the previous 2 movies, some of the lamest. Nevertheless, it does have some of the best action sequences that I'd seen, awesome actions.",7,2,2,16 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Enjoyable movie despite its flaws
","I didn't see it in 3D and I went in with very low expectation. Turned out I liked it more than I expected. Not at first though. When the prologue text rolled and seeing the phrase 'Supreme Leader Kylo Ren', I chuckled. The first 2 sequel trilogy movies are not where one would like to learn about leadership, the least of all Kylo Ren. I do realize that J.J.Abrams had a huge challenge in patching up the debacle that Rian Johnson left hims, nothing more symbolic than the Kylo Ren's smashed helmet which was patched together yet with the apparent red cracks. This movie was like that helmet.In The Last Jedi, many of the characters were demeaned or were rendered futile in meaningless mission. We basically learnt not much about the new characters from the first two movies. This movie at least redeem much of their dignity, and some respect of the legacy characters. We finally got some back story of Poe, with his Bounty Hunter girlfriend. The interesting Stormtrooper background of Finn finally brought up. We got to see more depth in Rey and Kylo Ren.The problem was, the movie tried to fixed so much that everything moved very fast, felt like squeezing into one movie with many, including the Episode 8 that could have been. The editing was overly done, and gotten confusing at time because of switching to the next scene before settled into one. People could be lost in what is going on in the fast pacing. The development of the characters thus was compromised by the short burst of scenes.Another problem was that J.J.Abram basically rehashed Return of the Jedi. In fact this trilogy was a rehash. Yes, many said Rian Johnson tried a new direction, but I called that a mean spirited sabotage. In Abrams' rehash, Rey was the new Luke Skywalker, Kylo Ren was the new Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker was the new Obi-wan Kenobi, and Snook was the new Palpatine before Rian Johnson snuffed him out inexplicably.Now in order to bring in menacing villain to take over Snook, this movie brought back the Palpatine, which didn't make sense following what happened to Return of the Jedi. Lots of this movie, particularly the latter part of the movie didn't make sense. However, they were not annoying and frustrating like the ridiculous action took place in Episode 8. There were also plenty of humor in this movie that flowed with the scene. So like the Kylo Ren helmet, there were cracks but still wearable. I did enjoy the movie as overall.Just a shame that Disney did not plan well from the start that we got a messy trilogy. As movies on their own, of the 5 Disney Star Wars movies, The Last Jedi was the only one I did not like. Even if Abrams directed Episode 8, we probably would get a rehashing of Empire Strikes Back. Seemed like Disney did not have a vision. One would imagine what the trilogy would have been if they planned the trilogy well or if George Lucas was involved.",8,3,11,1 January 2020
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Beautifully shot work in the art of facial expression
","This movie is definitely worthy of appreciation in terms of the novelty of its movie making technique of its time. I would say it is a difficult movie to make since there is really not much to a story, so Dreyer had to refer to camera angles and closed up shots to evoke emotion.Facial expression of the actors were essential to make it work. Maria Falconetti did a fantastic job in that regard. Even nowadays, I don't think many movies use the camera technique used in this movie. Because of the effectiveness, much of the movie is quite self-explanatory.Although I do appreciate of its artistic quality and like it very much, it is still not one of my top favorite since I am more driven by the literary side of a movie than the photographic side.I saw it only once at this time and much effort were exerted doing so because I wanted to pay close attention to the detail, especially for a silent film in the form of expressiveness instead of storytelling. I'm sure there is strong literary side to it as well. I can feel there are a lot more to this movie than I saw and that requires a multiple viewing, except that I am not ready for a second viewing yet. Still, a must see for at least once.",9,2,3,30 August 2007
Amadeus," Celebration of art at the highest level
","Those Salier's description of Mozarts' music, it was a blissful moment for me as I was glad I saw this movie in the cinema. I had mild interest in classical music until this movie showed me the great appreciation. I hated Opera until this movie came along. What about the setting? So beautiful. Each scene is like a painting itself. One very haunting and sad yet beautiful scene at the same time I thought was a transition from Leopold crumbling of the letter to the scrambling frighten deers.Abraham & Hulce gave those two musicians forceful identities. Abraham's performance is so passionate. Though I haven't seen the play, I doubt anyone can imitate Hulce's laugh so wickedly. Wonderful direction was done by Milos Forman. Peter Schaffer's writing is purely great theater, mixed with comedy and great imagination. Who cares if much of it is fiction. Also kudos needs to be given to the stage choreography Twyla Tharp who is known in the Broadway world.The only drawback was that I was so spoiled by the near perfection of the theatrical version, I became so nitpick on the editing in the director's cut. I felt a bliss just thinking about the movie. I know it had a great influence on many people. It was a shame that AFI dropped it off the recently revamped top 100 movies list. Nevertheless, Amadeus is a celebration of art in film at the highest level.",10,1,2,30 August 2007
1917," Felt like being one of the characters in the movie
","The story of 1917 was simple, about two WWI British soldiers with a mission to carry a message to another front to stop an attack that wind up to a trap costing over 1,000 lives. Bears in mind, this took place in 1917. We are used to the instant communication. They did not have that luxury. The soldiers had to go through dangerous and hostile territory to get the message delivered. The visual, the setting, and the way it was shot was so incredibly realistic that I was totally immersed into the situation like I was with these two soldiers. Like the soldiers, we don't know what is ahead.The movie was very intense, and the two hours went by quickly. The two actors were wonderful in their portrayal. Through their conversation, I got to know the kind of people they are. Another strong point was that musical score, which intensified the suspense. My really only major criticism was that there were few scenes seemed to over reached a bit for their plausibility, but it was relatively not as a big deal as compared to rest of the movie. Because of the great cinematography and setting, if you plan to see it, don't wait for it coming to video. See it on the big screen. Seeing in a small screen will missed out the incredible detail this movie offered. Powerful experience that most of us fortunate enough not to have to experience in real life.",9,0,2,3 February 2020
Titanic," A journey with more than the eyes can see, and an experience one won't soon forget
","The movie was about appreciating and treasuring the past, learn the lesson and be grateful of the kindness of those who crossed the path. We have two intersecting story, the Titanic and Rose. Titanic sunk by arrogant. Rose, the leading lady, revived through her spirit with the help of Jack, the leading man. The movie started in the present with the explorer digging the Titanic wreckage for treasure. We met the old Rose as she visited the explorers to help identify a drawing. she helped us worked our way into the past with the back story romance between her and Jack.The young Rose who was unhappy with her routine life was an engaged socialite. Her engagement was forced upon by her mother. Jack was a poor wanderer who won his way onto Titanic. They met at the Titanic bow one a night when Rose was considering suicide. Jack and young Rose took up much of the movie. Their story not only serve as the back story, but our tour guide of Titanic, to get our feel for Titanic before its fateful tragedy. Jack and Rose are two very uplifting people. I found their behavior interesting to watch. Jack is kind of representation of an everyday man, the many immigrants who landed in America in the early 1900s. He had a speech during a dinner, which he was invited to first class, covered it all.Rose was tied down by tradition. Titanic, that is the people who own Titanic, was overwhelmed with arrogance. There was a struggle between the two extremes. She was saved by meeting half way with a sacrificial help of Jack. No drastic changes without some kind of sacrifice. The future of shipping is saved by the sinking of Titanic with the sacrifice of the victims.As the story unfolded, the explorer understood that the Titanic is more than a gold mine. The audience understand the value of Titanic. The back story helped us understand the importance of Titanic to her and the symbolism of Titanic for the explorer. Basically, the movie took us to a meeting with the haunting ghost of the past.The movie had many powerful lines about life, particularly from Old Rose and Jack. Old Rose has quotes about the past. Jack has quotes about living a life. The sinking scenes of Titanic was haunting. It was Jack and Rose take us to the moment for those got stranded waiting for the boat to return. After watching the movie, I felt I have gone through the experience of Jack and Rose and many other victims. I can't say that about the other Titanic movies. Of course, even with great idea, the story won't work without the acting, the setting, the cinematography, and the music, which were all superb. Watching this movie was like I was on the Titanic maiden voyage.It was a sad movie in one sense because of the disaster, but it was also a hopeful movie because of what a person can struggle through despite of a traumatic event in the past. James Cameron had triumphantly raised the Titanic for everyone. He brought stardom to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet who played Jack and Rose respectively. He also revived the classic age actress Gloria Stuart who played the Old Rose. With the success of this movie, he was able to spent time in the next 10+ years doing research in revolutionizing digital 3D. Hopefully in not distant future, he will be able to re-release this epic in glorious digital 3D.",10,2,4,20 June 2009
Joker," Powerful film on social commentary using a comic book villian
","I can understand why some people would not like it. The pace was slow. There were moments that would make the audience saying 'What?', kinds of like playing games. However, the movie on the whole was a powerful one. We were basically in his head most of the movie. We saw what he sees, and this guy was a walking time bomb. He had many sign of trouble, lack of confidence, self insecure, and loneliness. Because the problem was not treated, he went spiraled down. He could be a metaphor for many brewing problems, like he could be Hong Kong since the Tiananmen Square massacre when the city got traumatized for those who know the history of the city. Despite the slow pace, I thought it fitted perfectly his inner struggle and his mental breakdown. The setting was outstanding, and needless to say the performance. Hard to say if I still like it on another viewing, but at this moment it is one of the best movies I have seen from 2019.",10,6,11,29 December 2019
