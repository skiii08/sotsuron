The Hangover," Oh my God, Classic !!!!!
","One of the best comedies i've ever seen. Just funnier than superbad movie. Zach Galifianakis is incredible in this movie.If you want to laugh a lot watch it now!!!! I don't understand what is wrong with some people. Really, who gives one for this movie must have some serious mental disease or something.You that like to read reviews before watching the movies, DON'T Believe IN THE PEOPLE THAT HATED THIS MOVIE, it's really a masterpiece, and probably one of the funniest movies ever made.if you didn't watch it yet run and watch it...THAT'S CLASSIC!!!!!",9,2,4,24 November 2010
Superbad," wow !!!
","Just one of the best teenage comedies ever made!Really really really funny. If you didn't watched it yet find a way to see it as soon as possible. Really smart jokes and really fun ones. Be prepared to laugh out loud. For the people who is aged +45 years old, we clearly can see in the user ratings report that this is not a really good movie for them. Teens tend more to like this film because its all around them. Drinking partying and we can't forget a lot but a lot of laughs.If you are a teenager you'll really like this movie. I know I'm getting repetitious but I'm not lying when I say that this film is REALLY REALLY FUNNY!!!!",8,0,2,16 November 2010
Up," Not just for children
","This movie is for any person at any age, really funny, great story, A MUST WATCH PIXAR MOVIE. I didn't expect much from this film, I watched it with my sister who was 9 at the time, I thought like ahhh... another kid film. But no, it's for any person at any age.I'd say that it's in the top 3 pixar movies and one of the best animations i've ever seen. There's a lot of action, adventure, drama, and comedy. Impressive with a moving story and a really big adventure.You can see that approximately 5% of the ratings are below 6, and that approximately 78% of the ratings are above 8.So what are you waiting, go watch it!",8,0,0,2 December 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Simply one of the best movies ever !
","This is, by far, one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's simply moving. Incredbly perfect in all the aspects. The story is unbelievable, with great actors and a director who really knew how to make the story work.Andy Dufresne really got the bad luck when he was incriminated for the murder of his wife and her lover. He had all the clues against him, and not a really convincing alibi. He made some friends in the prison, including his best friend, the guy who could get things('Red'), and the director of the prison. Using his experience as a former banker, he helped the director of the prison to make lots of money corruptly.He helped the director in exchange for some favors. But the director didn't helped him when he most needed him, and, to make it worse, he killed the only witness who knew the guy that had really killed Andy's wife and her lover.What anybody expected is the end of this story, which I wont give away. I can only say that the hope Andy had for things to work out had materialized, and the good guys lived happy forever.Masterpiece.",9,0,0,3 December 2010
