Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Now this is a O-mage!
","I had the good(?) fortune to see this wonderful flick in the same week as Van Helsing. It was everything Van Helsing tried to be, and failed miserably at actually doing.This movie isn't really very original. And in this case I don't mind. QT has put his love and knowledge of films into this two part epic and it shows. He has a deft touch and knows how to get good performances from his cast, which were all perfect for their parts.I really can't find a flaw with the film, other than the lack of originality. That is not to say that QT did not put his own personal spin on things, or that this movie was a 'creation.' But it is a master work of synthesis, combining things not usually found together into a nearly seamless whole.If one is a QT fan this film is a must see. If you loved old westerns, Japanese Anime, Honk Kong Cinema (and/or Kung Fu films in general) this is a must see. If you want to see something that will seem very familiar at times, but still challenge you, this is a must see.If you don't like gore, violence, 'adult situations' or foul language, stay away.I got to watch the DVD then go see the film the next day, I recommend this, and I am looking forward to owning both Kill Bill DVDs.",7,0,1,21 May 2004
Van Helsing," Is it too trite to say that this movie sucks?
","While I can't say I'd nominate the leads in this film for Academy awards in their previous roles, (XMen & Underworld) I did enjoy those films. Ditto both Mummy films, which I thought were carried more by the cast's charisma than the FX or the less than stellar writing. So I was optimistic about this film.I hate it when I'm disappointed. This film has very few redeeming qualities. I had thought that the second Mummy film had pushed the cartoonish action limit about as far as it could go. Wrong, it can go farther, but it shouldn't have.This film would have been much BETTER if they had spent $50M less on FX and $100K more on a single talented writer. And the same amount on nearly any other director.This completely clich√©', wholly unoriginal and derivative weird mishmash of steam punk, vampire, werewolf, James Bond and superhero film is ... a mishmash. It has all the appeal of a cold plate of goulash combined with cabbage and ice cream, all topped with mustard.So, given its name, I think one can best sum up this film by saying, it sucked!",3,1,1,21 May 2004
