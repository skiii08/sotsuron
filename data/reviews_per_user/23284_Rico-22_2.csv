The Blair Witch Project," Definately worth the price of admission
","Well, after seeing all the hype surrounding this independant film, I decided that it was time to check it out for myself.  Although I knew the basics about the storyline, I avoided reading anything that might spoil the story for me. I found the movie to be interesting, and maybe a little unsettling, but I wasn't terrifed as some people who viewed the film seemed to have been. Don't get me wrong, it has good acting, and the characters definately seem to be really scared, but I just wasn't scared with them.  The ending of the film felt a little unfulfilling.  I mean, well I won't spoil it, but once you see it you'll know what I mean. The premise is great, I think that a big-budget flick with this kind of a storyline would definatley be terrifying.  I hear that a sequel is already in the works so you can bet it will have a bigger budget than 60 grand. In conclusion, I feel I definately got my moneys worth for this film, although I did only pay a matinee price.  Rating 7/10",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The best war movie ever.
","This movie made me realize how horrible war is, and why it is important that we are never involved in another one.  As always Spielberg has presented us with such an exciting and involving picture that the experience will not soon be forgotten.  There are some stand-out performances in this movie.  Tom Hanks puts on an exceptional performance as 'Capt. John Miller', trying to keep his men alive as they engage in a mission that even he himself has trouble believing in.  Another great performance by a fine young actor named Barry Pepper, as the talented sniper who quotes scripture as he disposes of his enemies.  This film grabs a hold of you from the opening scene storming the beach, and doesn't let go until the closing credits and beyond.  About the highest endorsement I can give this movie, is that my Grandfather was in the WWII and he saw the film and said that it was as close to being in a war that(hopefully) I would ever get. Kudos to all involved in this amazing motion picture.",10,0,0,17 February 1999
