The Avengers," A movie of 3D in terms of screen and character!
","A must watch for May ! This movie definitely keeps the style of Iron Man : lots of funny lines, excitement, quick peace line and mouth-dropping high-technology weapons Well-written dialogue loaded with entertainment, message and clue. Some lines make you laugh spontaneously , but when you think them twice will reveal the value of each character.(E.g A:We need a plan of attack B: I got a plan, ATTACK!)The plot is very 3D ! It well-depicted the role, character and struggle of each hero to make you hardly dispense anyone of them in the movie. Say I cannot imagine how this movie will looks like if your take The hulk away, not to mention Iron Man!!!In short, I never check my watch during the play as every second is so breath-taking Currently it is the first runner up on my comic hero movie list, just after Batman (the villain and the inspiring quote of Batman is unparalleled!)",9,1,4,27 April 2012
Cloud Atlas," A puzzle solving movie which make my day!
","Cloud Atlas is a puzzle solving movie : you got 6 different world which individually happens not in chronological order. It likes a mega version of 'Mometo' as the coverage of timeline may span hundreds of years, or a bit like 'Inception' but you are not jumping into different dreams but world.Yet the camera keep jumping back and forth : This second the people are killing each other with arrows and sword, the next frame plasma guns is the basic weapon. It may sounds a but confusing to you at the beginning of the movie, but just relax. The epic scene cutting to link different world makes the stories jump around quite smooth, and bring in one of the key message of the film: Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to othersIf you believe in karma & after lives, enjoy mystery and an alternative love story, Cloud Atlas is going to amuse you.",9,4,5,2 February 2013
