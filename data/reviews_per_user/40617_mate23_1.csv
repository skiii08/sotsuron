Skyfall," Very Disappointed!
","Great scenes, good conversations, good execution but after the promising first half hour the main story is just so dull. Javier Bardem acted well but his character was the worst..blonde villain with an accent, thought we were past this. Whatever happened to the great main story of the first two? I thought it was supposed to be a trilogy! They left the first two unfinished. I would rather have watched Casino Royale (which is by far the best action movie ever made) again for the 20th time instead... Hopefully the IMDb rating will go down eventually from 8.1 as more people go to see it, but I it's currently way too high..too many people are raving about it, probably because it's just like an old bond movie with many good but pointless and not connected scenes following each other..casino royale was a breath of fresh air, but unfortunately unique and didn't get the sequels it deserved..",6,5,12,25 November 2012
