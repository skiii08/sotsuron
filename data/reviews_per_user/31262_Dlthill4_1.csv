The Incredible Hulk," The Hulk returns
",Yes yes and more yes!! This is what a superhero movie is supposed to be like. It is catching its unfair share of knocks for not having the 'heart' of Ironman but let me ask you something; didn't we have the heartfelt Hulk a few years back? And didn't even blind deaf mutes scream how bad it was? This is exactly what I want from a Hulk movie. There was pain and there was heart but when your 'superhero'(for lack of better words) uncontrollably transforms into a giant beast that kills anyone that isn't Betty Ross how much heart is there. Anyways enough about heart. This movie intrigues you with its portrayal of Bruce banner and would you expect any less from Ed Norton? The CGI is amazing and the battle scenes are all impressive in both their scale and effects. You feel bad for Banner as all he wants is to stop this beast within him and be with his one true love. The action scenes work. the love scenes work. The comedy works especially well. Overall this is an amazing Marvel flick that had it come out before Ironman would be getting all the love from everyone but was released an unfortunate few weeks too late. Do not compare this to another movie enjoy it for what it is and you'll be amazed!,10,2,4,19 June 2008
