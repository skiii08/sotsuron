Marie Antoinette," A stinker!
","So Sofia Coppola also directed Lost in Translation - that explains the utter lack of focus or any other redeeming qualities of this waste of celluloid, with the possible exception of the photography.Poor Sofia trying to be New Wave again, and unfortunately for her she succeeded, taking an endless two hours to tell us how dull and meaningless life at Versailles was in the 18th century. Well, we got the message in the first ten minutes, Sofie, so what else can you tell us?! What is it with these European neo-realists and new-wavers, anyway, making such bluntly obvious trash over and over again? I think it's a joke on the audience, and they're laughing all the way to the bank while we're supposed to congratulate ourselves on our faux sophistication at being able to sit through their self-indulgent crap.This is one of those rare occasions where I intend to take the local video store up on its offer of a full refund for any movie that a customer really hated!",1,0,1,18 February 2007
