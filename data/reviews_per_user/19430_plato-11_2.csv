Casablanca," Every performance is top-notch.
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It is one of the best films I've ever seen. Usually when I see a movie that is as highly regarded as this, I perversely try to not like it. This one, however, is impossible to dislike. Peter Lorre gives one of the most memorable performances of his career, even though his screen time is roughly four minutes. Claude Rains is at his unflappable best, and has many of the most memorable lines in this film. Humphrey Bogart plays the type of character he does best, the bitter drunk. Ingrid Bergman is absolutely breath-taking, and not in an ugly baby way. I would recommend this to anybody.",9,2,2,28 December 1999
Psycho," This movie is the greatest!!!
","I love this movie! I've literally watched it hundreds of times, and every time I notice something new. Tony Perkins gives his best performance as Norman Bates. All of the other performers do a great job as well. This is my absolute favorite movie. It still has the ability to shock people today, which is a testament to its power. The shower scene is one of the most effective murder scenes I have seen, all without actually showing the knife penetrating the skin. That just goes to show that today's slasher movies are going about scaring people the wrong way.This is a movie that is impossible to become bored with, no matter how many times you have watched it. This is Alfred Hitchcock's best film.",10,10,19,28 December 1999
