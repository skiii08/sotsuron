The Avengers," Horrible misuse of Thor and Hulk.
","Really did not like this movie. Not sure why it's getting good reviews. Meant to tug at the heart strings and to a degree that works but takes two incredible characters, Thor and Hulk, and completely misses the mark. Portraying Thor as a lazy, slovenly.This film was a wretched excess. Too many things going on. Too long. More characters just means you have less time for the characters you live. In my opinion you can lose Chris Pratt, Ant-Man and give more time to Spidey.",4,0,6,4 May 2019
