Sucker Punch," Should have been called Cheap Shot.
","Entertaining. Held my attention throughout. The shifting narrative was easy enough to follow but gave the film an appearance of a depth that just isn't there. Justice is a heavy theme and the payoff just isn't there. There is a lack of identity in most central characters and there's little emotional resonance as a consequence of this. Having said all this, I go back to my original statement. Think Michael Bay directing Inception 2 and you're not far away. Conceptually this film is magnificent. All credit should go to the screen writer. However, the major shortcomings as mentioned above leave a real sense of disappointment. Could have been a classic.",4,2,9,24 June 2011
