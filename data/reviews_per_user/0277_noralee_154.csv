The Blair Witch Project," A Tribute to What You Don't See is Scarier Than What You Can See
","Far be it from me to criticize the Hollywood hype machine when it helps a small indie movie, but I do feel the need to defend 'Blair Witch Project' against people who say they were disappointed in it as a scary horror movie. That's because it's not really a scary horror movie! It's a quite clever 'Twlight Zone' episode about the power of the imagination to be scarier than life, or the undead.Even my son came away saying it was a good model of a cheap, fun, creative-made student film.It's best seen with the hysterically funny faux documentary about 'The Curse of the Blair Witch' which is to A & E/History Channel documentaries as a certain genre-inventing rockumentary is to VH-1's 'Behind the Music.'

Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Magnificent Tribute to the Movies
","'Kill Bill, Volume 2' confirmed for me that I will never, in my entire life, ever be able to see as many movies as Quentin Tarantino has already seen.While 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' convinced me that I would not in fact want to see the zillions of samurai, chop-sockey, anime, etc. genre films that he had seen and was joyously reenacting in every chapter, 'Volume 2,' a.k.a. the second half of really one movie, is an extensive tribute to movies which I have seen, from John Ford and Sergio Leone Westerns to Billy Wilder comedies and noirs and on and on. In a recent interview with Charlie Rose, the voluble Tarantino made his case as a film historian by claiming that Uma Thurman is his visual muse like Josef von Sternberg's inspiration was Marlene Dietrich, but that was just one calculated explanation for the older demographic who watches PBS as their violent collaboration may make Scorcese/DeNiro comparisons more apt.In 'Volume 2' the other movie references are astounding and breathtaking -- every note of music (the extensive actual samples and the connectors by Robert Rodriguez), every setting, prop and article of clothing on screen, camera angle, actor cast, through all the nostalgic credits, let alone every clip any character is watching on their TV, is a loving tribute to another film (we will have to wait for the super deluxe collector's edition DVD that combines Volumes 1 and 2 to communicate the footnotes with multiple eggs).Yet it manages not to be a pastiche or a parody, but a masterful, post-modern work of art culminating in a passionate expression of love of movies as the ultimate bed time story (as accompanied by one of my favorite songs, Shivaree's creepy take on 'Good Night Moon'), even if it cannot stand on its own to be enjoyed by the kind of person who only sees a couple of movies a decade. Tarantino may be a motormouth but he is in complete control of all these references, cutting them up like a collage and lovingly transforming them within his vision.To the disappointment of the kid in the back row who didn't shut up, 'Volume 2' has far less sock 'em violent set pieces, cartoonish or otherwise, than the earlier chapter, and far more very funny humor and marvelous dialog, especially as delivered by an iconic David Carradine (others will connect him to this film via the TV series 'Kung Fu,' but I first loved him in the TV version of 'Shane,' which is also recalled here). From the planes of his craggy visage, to Uma's gleaming eyes and lips, to the cinematography of Robert Richardson, this is also a strikingly beautiful film.It is certainly not necessary to have seen 'Volume 1' to appreciate the second part, but that adds to the power of the unexpectedly cathartic change that The Bride undergoes on her quest, redolent of 'The Wizard of Oz.'Tarantino emotionally yet ironically makes the case that violent movies are fantasies that don't turn people into killers, rather they can bring families together. And now I do want to catch up on samurai movies!(originally written 4/30/2004)",10,2,4,19 December 2005
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Clunky, Dated Story with Nice Costumes
","I figured how bad could it be to watch Matt Damon and Charlize Theron for two hours in 'The Legend of Bagger Vance'? And I have a fondness for sports romances. But the movie feels like it was made in 1939, complete with the smiling darkie servant (Will Smith). Damon and Therize were supposed to have been affianced in 1916, went through very good-looking hell of war and the Depression, and are reunited in 1931, well, gee, then by how they look they must have been 10 in 1916. Damon's just another Robert Redford Golden Boy and has nowhere the appropriate washed-up athlete look that Kevin Costner had in 'Tin Cup,' a much better golf movie. Theron gets to be The Girlfriend Who Wears a Different Gorgeous Period Outfit in Every Camera Shot. She shows a bit of spunk, as does Damon, in the washed-up beginning, but the whole thing loses pazzazz during the match.Redford seems to think that golf can be invested with the same magic as baseball in 'The Natural' and can be a stand-in for American idealism as baseball is in 'Field of Dreams.' On a segregated country club golf course?? The rest of the audience loved it, cheering and clapping at each of the character's successes. I had trouble staying awakeNot enough use is made of period music to match the costumes. (originally written 11/5/2000)",3,1,5,21 December 2005
The New World," A Mythic Exploration of a Clash of Civilizations
","'The New World' is a sophisticated and breathtaking look at a pivotal moment in history -- the meeting of English colonists with the native peoples of North America. Writer/director Terrence Malick tells a powerful story of mythic proportions through flesh-and-blood individuals. It is a doomed story of sights, sounds, contrasts, passions and miscommunication. The changes are powerfully and gradually shown, with minimal dialog, through the three-part story of the curiosity, bravery and adaptability of an extraordinary young woman. Where 'Thin Red Line' looked at the relationship between war and the environment, here is the relationship between religion and the environment. This is a clash of gods, those communing with Mother Earth vs. those proclaiming service to Jesus Christ. This is a metaphorical retelling of Adam and Eve thrown out of Eden.In the pivotal, and primarily emotive, role of the conflicted, complicated John Smith, Colin Farrell is not just the preternatural rebel, but really uses his visceral masculinity. He scruffily comes off the water (a recurring image) in chains and is only saved from hanging for mutiny because his military skills are deemed essential by expedition leader Christopher Plummer. Plummer orders cutting all the trees around to build fortifications, initiating their environmental desecration. He sends Farrell off into the wilderness for trade before returning to England for supplies (I've read that his voice-over Manifest Destiny pontifications were added in the revision).What follows goes on a bit long like 'Dances with Wolves' as Smith gradually finds his soul with the natives (his tattooed torso fits in with their colorful body displays) and falls in love with the chief's daughter (never called Pocahontas). We see their peaceful domestication of the environment with crops, fishing, families, homes, governing council -- though they do have weapons so it's not a pacifist idyll (the tribal issues are hard to follow, and it's not clear that briefly seen shaman Irene Bedard is her mother). He again gets saved from execution, legendarily by her, and is in effect reborn. Their time 'in the forest' seems so unreal to him that in his narration of his thoughts he repeats 'I thought it was a dream.' This Edenic beauty makes his return to Jamestown that much more shocking as a gruesome 'Lord of the Flies' society has erupted like an environmental original sin -- they have stripped the sea of fish and the land in a mad search for the gold of the Indies instead of tending crops. They are insane with religious fanaticism and internecine, murderous arguments with cruel neglect of even children. We see glimpses of character actors scarily effective in showing a miniature society gone to hell.Smith makes the fateful decision to side with his white brethren who are in such desperate, foolish need, even when they viciously reject his help and advice. Cassandra-like, he urges his native love 'don't trust me,' seeing the future ruin of the natives though incapable of preventing it, letting the Chief think the colonists will leave.She remains tragically idealistic and hopeful, rejected by her father for helping the colonists. There is a confusing part two of their love story that duplicates the images of being free to be together in the wilderness, but not in either of their's civilization. He protests: 'Where would we live? In a tree top? In a hole in the ground?' He rejects her, as well as the moral compromise of using her as a hostage when relations between the natives and settlers deteriorate from first random then wholesale violence. Her character matures; Farrell's does not, preferring her innocent and untouched by progress. He uses personal ambition, and even the religious strictures of Leviticus, as an excuse, leading to one of their few exchanges: 'Did you find your Indies, John?' 'I think I went past it.'Q'Orianka Kilcher makes this work, miraculously for someone so young. She is not only emotionally expressive, has magical physical chemistry with Farrell and is explosive in grief and longing, but is also incredibly physically active as she changes from boundless barefoot freedom to the cautious confinement of corset and boots, and eventually conversion through baptism under a stream of water to emerge as 'Rebecca'. And she's beautiful. I saw the film twice to take in the characters' confusing trajectories, but both were Malick's revised version, which I've read cut the development of John Rolfe's (Christian Bale) patronizing, but loving, relationship in civilization with her ('You don't really know the meaning of the word marriage, do you?' All she asks is 'Are you kind?'). I wanted to see more of their courtship within the manipulated agricultural environment instead of the repeat of her and Smith's sensual forest frolics. Where Smith guiltily thinks 'I am not the man you think I am,' she moves on to Rolfe: 'You are the man I think you are.' Ironically, the cash crop the natives teach the colonists is killer tobacco.The closing visit to London is a striking contrast. The marvels of a busy city and the pomp of the Royal Court are not overwhelming but vignettes, like her sympathizing with a caged animal. What is creatively striking and deserving of the extended screen time is 'Rebecca', and another native Wes Studi, strolling in formal and topiary gardens. This civilization's controlling mastery over nature is stultifyingly complete. Yet the resourceful young woman adapts, cartwheeling through the mowed grass, climbing a tree and playing with a child, briefly finding happiness.While Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is gorgeous, the sound design and editing are magnificent, as the silences, natural sounds and man-made interruptions are used in tandem. James Horner's swelling score is his best ever, including bits from Wagner to native instrumentation and vocalization. But the music is carefully used for cultural emphasis around the ambient sounds, from the opening to the end of the closing credits. Stay through to hear the full effect.",10,6,13,21 February 2006
Howl's Moving Castle," A Visual Whirlwind of Humor and Magic, But a Bit Confusing
","'Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)' builds on the animation and special effects classics of the past to create a marvelous visual world, though I haven't read the Diana Wynne Jones novel to know how much is invented by adapter/director Hayao Miyazaki.There's the scarecrow, magic meadow and shrinking witch from 'The Wizard of Oz,' the scary forest from 'Sleeping Beauty,' the spell on the hero from 'Beauty and the Beast,' the frightening, drunken nightmare from 'Dumbo,' the Cheshire Cat from 'Alice in Wonderland,' the battles from the Disney studio's anti-Nazi propaganda cartoons, the sad statue from Oscar Wilde's 'The Happy Prince,' the chicken-legged house from the Russian Babi-Yar legends, as well as visual references to the classic adaptations of 'Yellow Submarine' and 'Gulliver's Travels,' while characters morph in and out of spells like the faces from a classic Michael Jackson video.But this tale has unusual elements not seen before, as the tributes fly by. The spell by a spurned witch seems to have ironically turned the hero into a threatening woman-chaser, though, confusingly, as the spell progresses, and even more confusing when we travel to the past to see how he got enchanted, he becomes a peacemaker when the film suddenly changes to a war, causing him to fight off another physical transformation, like the demon-bitten hero of 'Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime),' with a strong anti-war message.The witch has also cast a spell on the heroine, turning her into an old woman, and much of the delightful humor is from her struggling with her infirmities even as gray power triumphs, such as a scene when she and her nemesis compete to get up the royal stairs.Every inch of the screen is filled with a dazzling and quickly changing scene and climate and would make the sub-titled version a distraction. The English-language voices are mixed in effectiveness. Christian Bale is surprisingly bland with his Americanized accent, Emily Mortimer confusingly British as the young heroine. Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner are marvelous as mature witches, and Jean Simmons as old Sophie is both touching and humorous. Billy Crystal is way over the top as Calcifer the fire, but brings to mind his small role in 'The Princess Bride,' and such sidekicks are usually done for broad humor.This is the first Miyazaki film I've seen in a theater so I don't know if the detail in his previous works is quite so breathtaking. It is charmingly set in a Jules Verne-period Victoriana where technology can coexist with magic, such as in flying machines. A complex townscape with streetcars is trumped by lovely scenes of snow falling and rain slowly soaking a dress.While the mother isn't dead as in most such films, just a bit pre-occupied, the occupants of the Castle re-create their own family, including caring for the apparently now senile witch -- wouldn't it be nice if we could all just add another bathroom to our houses.The music is fairly corny, so the long patches of silence are a relief.I don't know why this has been mostly distributed through art houses as children in the wider world of multiplexes would enjoy it, even if the story is a bit complicated and confusing.",8,1,2,18 July 2005
Walk the Line," Enthralling On Stage and Off Stage Romantic and Musical Story
","'Walk the Line' is enthralling from the opening scene as it makes clear this is a bio pic equally of sound and sight. We are aware of a strong rhythm as we're told a signature date and and place in musical history -- Folsom Prison 1968 -- and only leisurely is the source of that gradually increasing rumbling beat identified. Just as we are anticipating a standard performance recreation, the gray of prison shifts suddenly to a flashback of the wide open spaces of childhood memories that are not as sunny as the sky.Director James Mangold in obviously close partnership with musical supervisor T. Bone Burnett ties the intertwined, riveting stories of Johnny Cash and June Carter very much to their roots in Americana music at mid-20th century, capturing the interplay of music, period life on the road and feelings. The tense dramatic scenes are silent on the soundtrack, completely enthralling the audience, so that the music emphasis is on music-related scenes.The detail on music authenticity is marvelous, both in the background selections, like Wanda Jackson, and the foreground re-enactments, as Burnett has done so well from 'O Brother Where Art Thou?' to 'Cold Mountain,' but the film doesn't patronize to explain the historical significance to un-musically knowledgeable audience members as it's more personal here. So it's just background mise en scene that we see Johnny the child drawn to listen to the Carter family on the Grand Ole Opry radio show, as we hear June the child introduced, when his family finds even those icons of traditionalism too far astray from gospel music. Later we see him take in the black and white sounds and rhythms of post-war Memphis, drawing him to legendary Sun Studios. Though Dallas Roberts' portrayal of Sam Phillips seems a bit too bland, at least compared to how charismatic the legendary producer seemed in later interviews (let alone Rip Torn doing a similar character in '40 Shades of Blue'), we are gradually brought into the ferment of the rockabilly nexus that revolutionized popular music -- Jerry Lee Lewis (engagingly captured by Waylon Payne, from that signature tinkling of the 88s to the 'killer' personality); young Elvis (Tyler Hilton doing one of the mildest of the interpretations on film); and Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice capturing his look but not quite his sound, as unfortunately Chris Isaak is probably too old now to portray the young Roy).June is a critical musical link for them all from country to rock 'n' roll and the burgeoning folk scene. Her important linkage from the traditional Carter family to rock to Dylan is beautifully, albeit quite briefly, encapsulated through a wonderful segue of Reese Witherspoon herself with an auto-harp singing 'Wildwood Flower' as 'My mama's favorite song' into a duet with Joaquin Phoenix singing as Cash on Dylan's 'It Ain't Me Babe,' with its lyrics particularly ironic for the duo. These connections become even more personally significant as Mother Maybelle is shown as a key forgiving and steadfast rock in both their lives. Details such as Cash's move from Sun to Columbia are just indicated visually in passing, while fans will finally now get straight how their children Carlene Carter and Roseanne Cash are step-sisters, as the guilt over their family responsibilities are a major plot point.The love story on stage is as dramatic as its off stage progression, even though we know how it'll eventually end, especially when June tries to limit their interactions to when they click musically. Witherspoon is breathtaking at capturing the complexity of June's life-- the comedy, that we of course know the actress is a smooth pro at, as June explains how she developed the comic persona in the family business to insecurely stand out compared to the musical talent she was surrounded by, as well as the tightly wound, uber polite professionalism of someone who's been on the road since childhood such that she can more than hold her own on tour with these raunchy, macho guys like traveling salesmen. But the depths of June's hurts from fans and family pressures that Witherspoon portrays, the sensuality of the romance and close friendship, and especially the magic she creates on stage with Joaquin Phoenix in the many combustible on-stage performances are new revelations to us of her talent.All this would be of illustrative interest to music fans if it weren't for Phoenix's intense performance. We see the influences come together that make up his guilt and rebellion that he incorporated into his songs. But the camera seems to restlessly move when it's not focused on him, as he powerfully draws the audience in from the first shot of him back stage at the prison. He is not just physically being another person -- not just living in Cash's skin in a dead-on capturing of body language and even an extremely close approximation of that voice-- but this is as much a psychological portrait as well. It's spooky this year with Philip Seymour Hoffman channeling 'Capote' and David Straithairn doing Edward Murrow in 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' but Phoenix goes beyond those recreations to an intensity of capturing the subject's inner life. He'll surely earn the Best Actor for the Golden Globes comedy/musical category.The camera work and cinematography are beautiful. While the many southern locations are used very atmospherically, each scene has a different cast of sharpness and color, from period brown to the grays of prison to the green of peace.Shooter Jennings too briefly captures his dad Waylon completely. Shelby Lynne is marvelous as momma Cash singing gospel in the cotton fields. Robert Patrick is a bit stiffly one-note as Cash's father.The packed opening weekend matinée audience with a multi-ethnic and multi-racial audience of all ages of adults as the kids and teens were at the new Harry Potter, was intently involved and cheered at the end.",10,2,6,23 November 2005
Lucky Number Slevin," Hartnett in a Towel and a Smile Trumps Alarming Body Count for Noir Entertainment
","'Lucky Number Slevin' at first seems like a humorous noir tribute a la 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' of mistaken identity before it harshly turns into 'V for Vendetta'. Telegraphed by a long prologue with the incredibly adorable kid from 'E. R.' with the crinkly eyes Oliver Davis, the first half of the film is dominated by the simply wonderful chemistry between a dryly laconic Josh Hartnett (with the crinkly eyes), quite attractively draped in a very low rise towel for at least a third of the film, and Lucy Liu in her best role since TV's 'Ally McBeal'. I'm not just biased that Liu grew up just down Queens Boulevard and went to the same high school as my son to admire that she plays an unusually smart cookie for a genre film, who is always thinking while she's volubly flirting, even while distracted by what's under that towel. I would certainly look forward to the two co-starring as a talky team again, even as he towers over her by over a foot. When the screen goes black as they hit the sack, with not even an old Movie Code fireplace or wind-blowing curtains in sight, director Paul McGuigan uses how much we want to see them together to cleverly distract us in the story when they have a cute morning-after.Morgan Freeman is ever wily, especially in arch monologues, but Sir Ben Kingsley grinds the film to a halt as 'The Rabbi'. Though he was so scary in 'Sexy Beast', he was similarly miscast in HBO's 'Mrs. Harris' as a Jewish heavy, his 'Rabbi' here is not just ludicrous in accent, plot and Talmudic rationalizations (it's usually British mysteries that enjoy the visual comedy of Hassidic criminals), but just seems like a desperate stretch to avoid the usual Italian or Russian mobster clichés.Stanley Tucci doesn't get to play cop often and he sure seems to be enjoying gritty here. Mykelti Williams is almost unrecognizable, playing closer to his 'Forrest Gump' character than his usual more recent wise acre cops. Robert Forster is a marvelous raconteur in a cameo monologue.While bread crumbs are left throughout the film, especially through nagging little disrupters that at first seem like debut feature writer Jason Smilovic's script or continuity errors but turn out to be clues, the tone of the film changed quite abruptly as the bodies piled up, particularly those of characters we'd gotten to know. The audience fell into an uneasy silence, partly because you could literally hear people concentrating to follow the sudden plot twists. The ending, however, is surprisingly less cynical than usual for the genre. But then Hartnett's smile could melt any cynic.While the cool opening credits recall classic Saul Bass, it doesn't live up to other film references, including Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' and various Bond movies. The discussion of L'il Abner's 'Schmoo' seems too 'Pulp Fiction' pop-culture referential, but I certainly will remember this film's definition of a Kansas City Shuffle if it's referred to in a future film.The production design of each character's apartment and entrance hallways is amusingly garish, looking like Britain in the mod-'60's. Some of the exterior shots do seem too obviously set in the fictional NYC of the other Bruce Willis with guns movie this year '16 Blocks' that is really in Canada (odd that in promotional interviews the cast said they shot the film in Montreal whereas all the credits acknowledge Toronto and other places in Ontario).The original trailer kept the mystery twists, but unfortunately the more recent ad campaign is giving too much away.",8,1,8,13 April 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Visceral Anti-Drug Experience
","'Requiem for a Dream' is a wallop of a follow-up to 'Pi' for director Darren Aronofsky.The casting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly as junkie Brooklyn Jews is a bit far-fetched, but they turn out to be excellent, completely involved actors and quite passable with the accent.The editing takes a '3 Kings' approach to drugs, going inside the head and body of abusers, but paced and accompanied by an increasingly mad soundtrack played by the Kronos Quartet.Ironically for the no one under 17 rating I would be like the mother in 'Almost Famous' and push my kids to go see it while screaming 'Don't Do Drugs!' at them. It did feel like an updated, brutal 'Reefer Madness,' like 'Cold and Sober' and other addiction movies like 'Drugstore Cowboy' but without any of the upside or hope, and this is way more visceral and visual.(originally written 10/15/2000)",8,1,2,28 October 2005
Catch Me If You Can," A Lot of Money Spent on a Slight Story
","Is 'Catch Me If You Can' an indicator of the end of Western civilization? How to justify the enormous amount of money and talent that went into creating a slight entertainment with zero significance? As my son pointed out -- the idea was to make a profit and they doubtless are. The cleverly done details overwhelm the substance, almost hiding the lack of any.The opening credits by Nexus Productions are a marvelous salute to similar animated openings, like 'The Pink Panther' and 'The Man with the Golden Arm,' period classics by noted graphic designers like Saul Bass.John Williams captures the Mancini feel of 'Peter Gunn' etc. with the finger clicking accompaniment to the opener. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, costumes and art direction stunningly continue the period feel, as well as expensive use of appropriate songs like 'Look of Love,' so we really do see all the money on the screen. Because Steven Spielberg doesn't spend $1,000 where he can spend $100,000. The camera is constantly moving back to reveal huge, decorated sets, and swooping around to show us just how much environment has been re-created. This is to Spielberg's oeuvre what 'Ocean's 11' is to Steven Soderbergh's. It feels like Spielberg was trying to do a tribute to Billy Wilder, without the cynicism that he simply can't do, but the film is dedicated at the end to the late Bruce Paltrow. Wilder would never see family deterioration and recreation as a motivator as Spielberg does, with a recurring theme of Christmas Eve reunions, complete with a wide-eyed little girl (with a similar divorce propulsion as in 'E.T.').Leonardo DiCaprio is much better cast here than 'Gangs of New York' as a protean teen-ager, while Tom Hanks is his usual obsessively dedicated employee. Christopher Walken is marvelous in a small, fatherly role and even gets to dance very briefly.But I kept wondering whether this story would have held up as a little indie film and decided it would not without the gloss.

Minority Report," Dick's Paranoia Watered Down to Hollywood Chase Flick
","I went to see 'Minority Report' as a Philip Dick fan, not for Tom Cruise. As soon as I heard he was cast, I knew he was either mis-cast or the movie would substantially change the original story. Ed Harris would have been a brilliant choice for Dick's intent in showing a mid-life crisis of faith with bureaucracy, and more logically setting up the conflict with his older (Max von Sydow as his usual craggy self) and younger (terrifically aggressive Colin Farrell) competitors.In Dick's story the titular discovery is a shocking revelation of the bankruptcy of policy-making behind bureaucratic intent, whereas here it's just a means to an end for Cruise's character to clear his name. Instead we get an action story that grafts Dick's story outline onto a tribute to George Lucas's brilliant student thesis project 'THX-1138,' which he himself later expanded into a feature film; I always cite those films as the best visual analysis of bureaucracy. I guess Spielberg wasn't satisfied that we never really knew what the politics were in Lucas's films so he provides explicit reasons via a personal rather than systemic conspiracy theory for the chase and an optimistic conclusion.On its own, we get a rippling Hollywood chase movie with a soupcon of the old 'The X Files' paranoia, now newly relevant about our Justice Dept. arresting people, and even several laughs.The cinematography for the future is wonderfully metallic and there's so many clever CGI's that the long credits list three 'in memoriam's to colleagues.Lois Smith is very effective as a cynical inventor, reminding me of the last time an older woman made a key appearance in a sci fi epic, 'Outland' in a role not necessarily written for a woman.John Williams's music is interferingly bombastic.(originally written 7/5/2002)",6,12,21,13 December 2005
Finding Neverland," Finding the Power of Imagination through the Schmaltz
","With just a bit of reining in the schmaltz 'Finding Neverland' could have gone beyond a very good movie to an excellent film. The film is at its best when, like 'Topsy Turvy,' it shows how an artist creates a beloved masterwork. Grounding the story in the theater helps us enter into James Barrie's head very effectively, such that it's just a small step for us to join him into the Imagi-Nation (as Kris Kringle called it in 'Miracle on 34th Street'). It is much more convincing than 'Big Fish' in showing us the power of the storyteller because it is related more to the joys of the child in all of us rather than the avoidance of maturity, though that's how other adult characters chide Barrie. I presume it is intentional that Barrie's real life seems so drab compared to his fantasies, but it is a bit stiff to watch. The child actors are at their best when they are not miniature Edwardian adults but are rambunctious brothers like the no-necked monsters in 'Desperate Housewives.' It's a relief to see in film that not all upper class Britons were banished to strict boarding schools. While mildly dealing with rumors about the nature of Barrie's relationship with the mother and her children, David Magee's script is weakened when he has the younger boys talk preternaturally like adults, especially when it is solely for tear jerking effect. The oldest brother's gradual acceptance of adult responsibility is convincing, but Peter is just a shade short of annoying. The biggest weakness in the film is the maudlin handling of the illness of Kate Winslet's character, which is as old-fashioned a decorous cinematic portrayal of consumption as Greta Garbo in 'Camille.' Could she not have at least been made up to look less radiantly healthy or did she only have Terminal Movie Starness?Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell have thankless, one-dimensional roles, but make the most of what they're given to work with and only the former gets to prove she believes in fairies.",Null,7,14,3 December 2004
Training Day," Inner City Western
","'Training Day' is really a Western transferred to an inner city setting. It's to Westerns like 'High Noon' and 'The Unforgiven' that 'Escape from New York' was to the sci fi genre. With a touch of 'Chinatown' and even 'On the Waterfront' and 'Maltese Falcon' thrown in for a complicated plot of double crosses and conflicting loyalties that I didn't completely follow but was made mostly credible by the recent LAPD Ramparts revelations.Denzel Washington is riveting, and more completely sunk into the character than he even was in 'Hurricane' and 'Malcolm X.' But then actors always thrive playing a villain more than the hero, or even a hero with mixed motives.Ethan Hawke rises to the bait effectively, though the script mostly only lets him be reactive; for him, this is an action role.The Latino and hip hop music choices are quite good, and the rap stars of course enjoy continuing their fictional gangstah personas on screen to add to their CD-selling props.

Friday Night Lights," Testosterone Is Given Full Rein in Texas
","'Friday Night Lights' is somewhere between 'Any Given Sunday' and Leni Riefenstahl's lyrical documentaries of Fascist gatherings. While this view of high school football is not as over the top as Oliver Stone's treatment of the excesses of the professionals, the criticisms that glide by in sight and sound are drowned out by the competitive story of the sport and overwhelmed by the obsession that Texans have with their Glory Days that the movie not only captures visually, through talk radio and booster confrontations with the coach, but ends up being as seduced by as these fans. I was personally horrified and disgusted at the money spent on huge stadia, teams and coaches - with none to spare on medical attention for the players-- but I didn't feel that came across to the guys filling the movie theater with their small sons (but then my sons were presidents of their debate teams). We don't even get to see how the academic side is doubtless being starved, which is only hinted at in the post script on how these players got on with their lives and in the fathers and fans that look to them to recall the peak of their youth, before alcoholism, stunted marriages, boring jobs, etc. While evidently quite a few liberties were taken with the characters in the book for dramatic effect (particularly I would think the racial aspects, not having read the book yet), the personal stories of the players and their families are very involving. The young actors are very effective. It's nice to see Lucas Black all grown up from his child actor days in 'American Gothic,' Southern accent intact. Newcomer Garrett Hedlund is particularly good in tandem with a very scary Tim McGraw, who is so strong that his character's post-game contrition doesn't balance out his abuse. The females are pretty much only around for the pre-season and just disappear until they are cheering at the final game, which didn't seem completely realistic, particularly about high school. While I know zilch about football and could not follow anything that happened at the games other than the score board, Peter Berg's in-your-face directing style grips you from the opening. The football games are shot 'Saving Private Ryan'-style, with excruciating grunts heard like bulls fighting for leadership of the herd (the sound editing should get an Oscar nomination), making the case that this is about testosterone given free rein. The soundtrack songs are a good selection of hip hop as background for the kids and classic rock for the dads, though there's less country music than one would expect to recreate the Texas soundscape.",Null,0,2,2 November 2004
Erin Brockovich," Conventional Little Guy vs. Big Corporation Drama Plus Julia's Smile
","'Erin Brockovich' is no 'Norma Rae' -- including the tell-off-the-guy scene is no where as effective as Sally Field's challenge by the sink. The first third or so of the movie is Julia movie star bright and snappy and captures us. (All of the other women in the movie are really bland so as not to challenge Julia's flash.) In, the second third she doesn't smile and the movie fades.The last third is a legal drama that's a little guy triumph over nasty corporation. One can't even tell that the director is the same Steven Soderbergh whose two most recent movies 'Out of Sight' and 'The Limey' had brilliant directorial control that stylistically added to the basic story.

Mulan," Delightful Animated Girl Hero who Breaks with Disney Traditions
","'Mulan' is not quite a chick flick and it's much better than 'Pochantas.' It has terrific animation and I forgot I was even watching animation. The script has some funny lines. The music is not great (the writers didn't ring any bells with me as to their past work) but good lyrics. I was disappointed that the music wasn't as Asianish as 'Lion King' is Africanish. And the final rap is a bit off-putting, though the segue into the Stevie Wonder song was fun.Eddie Murray isn't Robin Williams but he's fun. At least they do use quite a few Asian actors' voices - Wing Na Wen ('E.R.'), George Takei ('Star Trek'), B.D. Wong ('Oz') Pat Morita ('Karate Kid'). I think 'Mulan' is the first Disney animation post-Katzenberg and there's a couple of digs at him and responses to the criticisms of how he did the girl stars. There was a lot of criticism of how Katzenberg personally insisted on Jasmine in 'Aladdin's impossible Barbie shape and 'Mulan' takes that on with a line about how stupid it is to want such a narrow waist. Definitely a much more positive body image movie than under the Katzenberg regime. There's no dead mother syndrome here, well for Mulan anyway. The Captain's mother isn't mentioned. Not only is there a mom, but even a grandmom. The father is still Freudian - he's wounded. All the Disney dads of daughters have some incapacity or other or tragic flaw.Refreshingly, there's no wedding at the end with birds chirping as a canopy. The courting is assumed and the grandmom invites the captain to live there forever--but Mulan shuts her up. (originally written 7/23/1998)",7,12,13,8 November 2005
Fight Club," Scary Imagining of What A World Without Women Would Be Like
","The ads for 'Fight Club' are completely misleading. While 'Variety' is probably right to call it 'the anti-date movie,' the promos I saw gave absolutely no indication that in fact it's a social satire in a similar vein to 'American Beauty,' and likewise turns into a psychological thriller.It's Robert Bly's 'Iron Johns' taken to the extreme, only they're in the basement and then out in the cities instead of in the woods, which seems inevitably to result in 'Lord of the Flies.' If you only see the trailer you'll think it's a gratuitous violence-fest. Brad Pitt uses his bronzed and buffed movie-star image for specific effect, and the script even has him referring to the irony of celebrity-worship (though I wouldn't be enthralled if very young hunk-seekers would throng to see it). Helena Bonham Carter is in it only to try and convince us that the guys are straight, despite all the gleaming homo-eroticism splashed all over the screen.Edward Norton, of course as usual, is spectacular, with reminders of his 'Primal Fear' role.While the novel probably worked better in leaving more to the imagination, the cinematography does very well at making the dark side visual in a world that could be today, could be sometime in the near future in some city. The next urban step would be as portrayed in 'Blade Runner.'Certainly it's not a very hopeful view of what a world of only men, without women, would be like, so it plays into the hands of feminists, rather than rebelling against them. It could scarily be an argument for frequent wars to serve as a release valve, if today's video wars don't even do that. Or maybe just 'Rollerball' as a solution.(originally written 10/18/1999)",9,1,3,21 December 2005
Monster," A Tour De Force Performance in a Mesmerizing Character Study
","It is not just Charlize Theron's deNiro in 'Raging Bull'-like transformation that makes 'Monster' so mesmerizing, but her total performance.
Not since Hilary Swank in 'Boys Don't Cry' has an actress so completely inhabited such an unlikely role, completely overshadowing Nicole's nose, accent, and voice register change in 'The Hours.'But how on earth did writer/director Patty Jenkins know that Theron could do this? There is zero else in her previous resume by any stretch of the imagination to think that her previous fluff prepared her for this. I understand Theron coming on as producer to convince everyone else and I assume it was her connections that got a first-time director noted character actors for bit male roles by Bruce Dern, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and Lee Tergesen showing what he learned in 'Oz.'This is not just a tour de force performance but is within a brilliant examination of a truly disturbed yet desperately love-tropic person.  We gradually get inside her traumatized head as she ceases to be able to distinguish between victim and predator due to early and continuing abuse that renders her barely even able to function in the demi-monde let alone mainstream society.  The attention stays on the character study and barely shows the violence and gore, but rather the impact of its aftermath.
There has been less attention to Christina Ricci's excellent supporting role as her very confused and dependent companion only because she has a history of doing odd-ball indie films alternating with her mainstream Hollywood work.The score by electronic dance music's BT is excellent, as are the incisive selections of period power pop.",Null,0,0,18 January 2004
The Rookie," Overlong and Unoriginal
","I wanted to like 'The Rookie.' I like sports romances. I like director John Lee Hancock's other work. The soundtrack included the likes of John Hiatt, one of my faves (thoughthere wasn't much in original songs and the songs weren't very illustrative).I like Dennis Quaid (nice to see that smile again) and Rachel Griffiths (who is given almost nothing to do except prove that she's not always crazy 'Brenda' from 'Six Feet Under').But I was bored silly and simply lost concentration by the time the end finally came.Overlong and unoriginal.(originally written 5/19/2002)",2,4,11,22 December 2005
Memento," More than A Backwards Gimmick - Addictive Puzzle, Great Acting and Look
","'Memento' is for fans of 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Croupier,' and I've only ever found one person that didn't like either of those.Going one better than the circular story-telling of 'Pulp Fiction' or re-playing of' Run Lola Run,' 'Memento' takes us inside the head of an investigator with no short-term memory who develops various crutches to continue his vengeful search. I've been a fan of Guy Pearce since his Australian TV days, on into 'Priscilla' and 'L.A. Confidential' and this allows him even more range.For us to experience time the way he does, the story unravels through backwards scenes; the technique is indicated from the opening shot where a graphic Polaroid photo fades while being shook, instead of the expected getting brighter and clearer -- a visual metaphor for the protagonist as well. After that, the story isn't on literal rewind; instead we see the scenes in reverse order of how they happened; onion-like we see how the character ended up getting to the scene just before. If Humphrey Bogart's character thought 'The Big Sleep' tough to figure out, this one is even more convoluted.Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano are terrific, and not relying on some of their tics from other movies and TV shows, as the folks who may or may not be lying to or manipulating the protagonist.I'm not 100% sure how all the pieces fit together and went to see it again a week later -- and came away with different interpretations. And I got a third interpretation from reading the original short story by the director's brother that was in the April 2001 issue of 'Esquire.' And doubtless there's other interpretations in the special edition DVD. (originally written 4/1/2001)",10,1,3,30 November 2005
Lords of Dogtown," A Souped -Up Ride With the Sk8te Boys of Summer
","'Lords of Dogtown' is a rollicking companion piece to Stacy Peralta's documentary 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' about the very young men who transformed skateboarding into a commercial extreme sport.Director Catherine Hardwicke has a marvelous, visual instinct for capturing the lightning in a bottle that is the energy of adolescence, as she demonstrated with teenage girls in 'Thirteen.' While the actors are actually a few years older than the founders of the movement, astoundingly, were, they explode with adolescent fidgeting on the screen that then channels hormonal and emotional frustrations into constant movement on first surfboards then skateboards.This film fills in many of the gaps in their personal lives that were frustratingly missing from the documentary, with evident artistic license as some characters are composites. Some rough edges are left out or smoothed over to keep it from the usual sex, bad contracts and rock 'n' roll biographies.I had no idea that suburban-sweet little Emile Hirsch from 'Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' and 'Imaginary Heroes' was a Venice Beach sk8ter boy in his real life, albeit New School, so that he could so naturally embody the lithe, rebellious Jay Adams, who starts from and rolls to darker places than his cohorts.Brought much more to the fore is Tony Alva's Chicano family and Victor Rasuk shows that as in 'Raising Victor Vargas' he can passionately portray youthfulness and growing into maturity.Screenwriter Peralta may be a bit self-serving in how he lets his almost too nice younger self be so sunnily portrayed by John Robinson as the very image of a Southern California beach boy, but an incongruously responsible one -- he actually wears a watch to get to a real job. We learn even less here about his background than any of the other kids.Heath Ledger transforms himself into a stoner surfer Fagin, revealing better than the documentary the rise and collapse of the odd mentoring relationship the sponsor of the Zephyr Team created with boys who needed some kind of father figure in their lives.The restless, jangly cinematography races after them like a helmet-cam from the opening shots, on land, sea and especially in empty swimming pools, soaking up their vibes and momentum with quick editing.While this is more a clear-eyed cautionary ode to too-much too-fast adolescence than to testosterone, the women in their lives are given only a little more acknowledgment than in the documentary. Rebecca De Mornay, who started her career as a teen boy's lust object in 'Risky Business,' ironically now plays Jay's unstable mom, but she is not drawn as substantively as the similar mom in 'Thirteen.' Just as most rockers admit that they first slapped on a guitar to get chicks, this film is up front that the boys attracted groupies, and makes a half-hearted effort to personalize a couple of the young women for whom they compete, or maybe Nikki Reed is just miscast as Alva's sister. Even the concluding scroll about their futures, much more upbeat than in the documentary, leaves out their detritus of the women in their lives.The re-created settings and production design of the notorious Pacific Ocean Park Pier well illustrate the class differences between these outlaw locals vs. beach blanket surfer movies and the owners of those prized pools.The period music is mostly used just for atmosphere, from the opening riffs of Jimi Hendrix's guitar, but occasionally hits home with a character's mood, particularly Neil Young's 'Old Man' and Rod Stewart's 'Maggie May.' The hair styles, clothes and make-up are also much better done, including the wigs, than most '70's period movies, though why cover up the countless bruises the cast suffered, as presumably in real life the guys must have been banged up besides the one incident shown.Stay through all the credits to see clips of the real folks, including a sweet tribute to Jay as the font of the style.",8,21,50,4 June 2005
Shaun of the Dead," A Laugh Out Loud, Fond Satire of Zombie Movies
","'Shaun of the Dead' is a delightfully funny satire of '28 Days Later. . .' specifically, and of zombie movies in general. Taking place simultaneous to '28 Days,' but in a more suburban location, it both spoofs that film and provides yet another alternative, and much more amusing, ending, just when you think the joke has played out and writer/director Edgar Wright has literally backed his characters into a corner. Not only is the script laugh out loud funny, but the comic actors produce giggles on sight as they play their slackers completely straight and cheerfully well-meaning and foible-consistent throughout as they learn something about themselves, even as it pokes fun at this genre that usually has a nebbish rise up to be a hero. The loud musical choices add to the ironic merriment, even if some are used as complicated background set-ups for one-liners.",Null,1,3,1 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," As Fun as an Amusement Ride
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is an over-the-top romp that's just plain fun. Gee, much like an amusement park ride.Too bad the roster of good actors (including from British TV comedies 'The Office' and 'Coupling') were clearly directed to lay it all on broadly (except Jonathan Pryce who is very atypically laid-back and therefore wasted). Orlando Bloom doesn't get to do too much, Geoffrey Rush has a ball being a villain, while Johnny Depp steals the show with his loopy pirate captain (I like most folks comparison of him to Keith Richards). I figure the only reason he plays it sort of drunken and crazy is to not add an unintentional romantic triangle with a very contemporarily feisty Keira Knightley.For all the action, there's too many close-ups and not enough opportunity to take it all in from a broader perspective.Stay through the extensive credits (and, evidently yes, they did film some of it in the Caribbean) to see a cute plot coda.The music is so bombastic and continuous that it's not completely attributed to just Hans Zimmer but to a large team.

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Beautiful and Involving Adaptation of a Classic
","The visual success of 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is made possible by the innovations in special effects that were developed for 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. While some of the settings and monsters seem a bit recycled from that epic, the magical creations of the novel are recreated believably and beautifully.The opening of the story marvelously retains the setting of war time Britain during the blitz, complete with an Andrews Sisters song and war reports on the radio, setting the film in a reality where good was clearly fighting evil and evil was ruthlessly attacking civilians (just a bit of imagination is needed to jolt us to contemporary comparisons on either perceived side of several current struggles). While most of today's audience will not know about the evacuation of London's children to the safer countryside and their knowledge of train stations is probably from 'Harry Potter,' the embarkation farewell is almost as much a tearjerker as Dumbo being separated from his mother.Adding to the verisimilitude are the excellent child stars. Georgie Henley's 'Lucy Pevensie' could be the granddaughter of 'Scout' in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' for capturing wide-eyed innocence and curiosity without any cloying sweetness. William Moseley would get my pre-teen heart beating faster and he seems destined to play Jude Law's son, though without seeing him play with toy soldiers I wonder how 'Peter' suddenly gains expertise in military strategy and tactics other than instinctively rising to the white man's burden. Anna Popplewell's 'Susan' is not faint of heart as she combines femininity and tomboy action quite fetchingly. 'Skandar Keynes' as 'Edmund' well captures the temptation of sibling rivalry. Too bad they will too quickly age out for the sequels. As twinkly as James McAvoy is as 'Mr. Tumnus' the faun, Tilda Swinton is is so charismatic as the White Witch self-declared Queen of Narnia, that not only does she immediately get my vote in the MTV Movie Awards as Villain of the Year, even over Palpatine in 'Revenge of the Sith,' but I thought she was more effective than bland, Liam Neeson-talking lion Aslan, even as she was very Saddam-like using informers, committing torture, imprisonment, habitat destruction and offering candy as bribery (good lesson here about not taking candy from pretty strangers, let alone tattling on your siblings). Too bad her costumes were a bit awkward, but her hair design was both regal and woman warrior.Twenty years ago when I was first introduced to this book by reading it to my sons, I was completely oblivious to the Christian imagery, and could do so with this adaptation as well. Then as now I saw the gifts from Father Christmas as much a benign representation of the positive aspects of the Winter Solstice rather than eternal winter, as Christmas is at Hogwarts. Because the scene of Aslan's confrontation with the Witch is bloodless so as not to frighten children, it seemed more about emasculation to me than sacrifice, though having it take place in a Stonehenge setting seemed too specifically pagan (and that was constructed to celebrate summer any way). The battles are far less violent in clash and final results than in 'The Rings' saga, which they otherwise imitate.The talking animals are marvelously English, without any contemporarization or mugging that American animation inserts. Particularly fine are Ray Winstone as the voice of 'Mr. Beaver' and Rupert Everett as the voice of 'Fox.' The wolves are quite the scariest things in the movie, as well as the exhilarating chase scenes, so much so that I don't know if the 'wolf trainer' credit was literal or animatronic. A warning not to leave your seats immediately after the human participants are identified in the credits: the film continues to set up for the sequel. I didn't even recognize Jim Broadbent at first as 'The Professor,' while the housekeepers' accent seemed a bit out of place. The centaur wasn't particularly memorable. The closing songs by Alanis Morrissette and Tim Finn were lovely. The score was fairly pedestrian action-adventure, coming to life during the chase scenes and too bombastic during the battles.The dozen or so special effects teams listed in the credits demonstrated the globalization of the movie business these days -- from New Zealand to Guatamala to the Czech Republic and Poland to ILM and Los Angeles.The film is long, but the small children in the audience were only restless during the early set up scenes and were quite involved once the thrilling action started.",9,3,8,17 December 2005
The Notebook," Saved By Electric Casting
","'The Notebook' has a script and dialogue that even my die-hard teen girl and fellow crone chick flick fans tittered and gagged at a recent matinee. 
While I am in general fed up with stereotypical high-school romances being pictured as the Love of One's Life story line, this brief teen summer fling turning eternal was ridiculous, but I haven't read the original Nicholas Sparks book to know what was faithful or changed as the central characters have zero on which to base a relationship.  But there are salvageable elements.  I came out of curiosity to see Ryan Gosling as a big budget romantic lead, as opposed to his tortured misfits in indie films like 'The Slaughter Rule' and 'United States of Leland.'  While it strained credulity to the utmost that this carpenter from the wrong side of the tracks reads aloud from Whitman to entertain his dad (who prefers Tennyson, but then he's played by Sam Shephard), he is undeniably captivating eye candy. 
The surprise was how good his co-star Rachel McAdams was.  She lit up the screen like an old-fashioned movie star discovery so that you know that they're meant to be together just because the chemistry is much more electric than any suspense (though I am curious to see how Sparks defined 'waiting for you for seven years').  Kudos to director Nicholas Cassavetes for casting McAdams - perhaps inspired by his mother Gena Rowlands, both as a life example and for the plot. It's the kind of movie where I had plenty of time to think about why talented young actresses have been missing from romantic roles for so long, whether in chick flicks or action movies - even the MTV 'Best Couples Award' is tending to go to same-sex buddies.  Instead, we have had to endure wooden acting by models with little or no acting talent across from young guys whose attraction does put my fanny in the seat.  Which led me to consider several theories about why those with little non-visual talents are getting cast and how this movie and Cassavetes are different: 1) the casting couch is still in play and these women are doing traditional auditions; 2) the male directors have zero conception of what constitutes male/female chemistry on-screen because they play for another team;
3) the male lead is an egotist who doesn't want his light diminished, not realizing that a great pairing is synergistic; 4) TPTB think the movie can be marketed to men and so the women on the screen can just be wallpaper.  While the hair and costumes seemed to be modern interpretations of '40's styles and simply did not look authentically like an old Bette Davis movie, the cinematography by Robert Fraisse was lovely.  The flash forwards to James Garner and Rowlands together in the literal sunset of their lives added much more poignancy and weight to the film than this usual kind of story generates.",Null,1,4,4 July 2004
Bloody Sunday," One day of 'the troubles' packs a universal wallop.
","'Bloody Sunday' is a very startling, cinema-verite recreation of a very specific date (January 30, 1972), in a very specific place (Derry, Northern Ireland) of an event that for the Irish became 'our Sharpeville.'
But for an American audience with no benefit of subtitles for the brogues and working class Brit accents, no explanations outside of eventual context for lingo and slang (it took me awhile to keep track of 'provos' vs 'paras'), the quasi-documentary, in-your-face approach takes on a tragic universality.It could be part of a Cassandra trilogy with `Black Hawk Down' and `No Man's Land' about why military should not be in charge in urban strife, whether as 'peacekeepers' or in civil wars or regime changes, no matter how heinous the regime to be changed.  A lesson for the Baghdad invasion planners?
Cities are complicated social ecologies, and the film shows a great diversity of attitudes and pressures on all sides, managing to be both clinical in meticulous detail and visceral in shocking impact.  The film is probably not objective about the British (I don't think it's a coincidence that the imperious Brit 'observer' who takes repugnant charge is played by Tim Pigott-Smith who was a similar colonialist in `The Jewel in the Crown.') A central universal image becomes the awesome power of rock-throwing, unemployed teen-age boys to spark war.The liberals in the middle, clinging to dreams of Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and fair community relations, are morally destroyed over the course of a few hours and the extremists with guns on both sides feed on each other in perpetual destruction like the ouroboros image of the snake eating itself. I kept feeling I missed the exact flash point in a wandering attention moment and wanted to immediately re-watch it to see if I could track the gotcha! moment when escalation could have been prevented, so I look forward to this being available on video tape.But the film does clearly show that it was attitudes that created the violent outcome and consequent government non-investigation, as we see in so many police situations.  Once soldiers enter a city it is a police situation with all those complexities.I know James Nesbitt primarily from frothy Irish comedies, like `BallykissAngel,' so his staggering portrayal of the M.P. in the middle is a revelation, as he goes from planning a civil rights march to pleading with his girlfriend to physical heroism to a break-down in shock.
The version of the titular U2 song played out at the end, running well past the credits finish, is a moving, live, passionate audience sing-along where Bono shouts out other locales that have experienced similar situations to emphasize the universality.",Null,55,72,30 November 2002
Coffee and Cigarettes," Some Laughs as Celebrities Riff on Themselves
","'Coffee and Cigarettes' seems to be Jim Jarmusch riffing like Larry David's 'Curb Your Enthusiasm.'He places various celebrities from mainstream and underground music and films in different restaurant locations to sort of play versions of themselves in structured improvs with lines repeating around the theme of sharing coffee (or occasionally tea) and smokes.  Much of the humor is based on simplistic contradictions between the dialogue vs. the celebrity's public persona, such as Cate Blanchett playing herself and her ne'er do well jealous cousin, Bill Murray and Steve Buscemi moonlighting as waiters, Alfred Molina as a sycophant, Tom Waits and rappers dabbling in alternative medicine, Jack and Meg White evincing enthusiasm for Tesla the scientist, etc. There's some funny lines and unpredictable background music, including a wonderful evocation of Mahler.

Oldboy," Visually Exciting Update of 'The Count of Monte Cristo'
","'Oldboy' is a visually exciting update of 'The Count of Monte Cristo' as played out in Korean gangster style.It is a thrilling ride that dramatically visualizes the revenge theme, much as 'Memento' dazzled the murder mystery genre. Not only does the script, co-written by the director, create realism out of fantasy like Dumas's story, but each scene tops the next with production design, cinematography, camera movement and striking imagination. This film makes the case for cinema as a separate art form from literature, even as various proverbs and sayings are repeated with increasing irony.I had not read much about it in advance, other than Quentin Tarantino's understandable enthusiasm, so was alternately reviled by the cruelty and enchanted by balletic juxtapositions, such as what I gather is now considered the classic 'corridor scene' that is like 'The Matrix' meets 'A Night at the Opera.' If the imagery wasn't captivating enough, Min-sik Choi is mesmerizing in a tour de force lead role that demands a ceaseless exploration of emotions from catatonia to hysteria to brutality to tenderness.Not only do U.S. audiences miss what I'm sure are many keystone cultural references throughout the film, but key dialog is unfortunately exchanged when the subtitles are white-on-white, though I'm fairly sure I was able to infer the details sufficiently to follow the twists and turns of the plot, as for all the breathless film flam the core revelations become a bit predictable as they recall other infamous noir films even as they go way beyond Dumas.I could definitely have done without the repeating violent scenes that seemed an unnecessary tribute to 'Marathon Man,' unless this has some resonance for Korean attitudes about teeth.The diverse music score is wonderful, both the original elements and the use of classical and other music.",8,9,98,31 March 2005
Billy Elliot," Being Different Amidst Dark Times Can Be Joyous
","I went to 'Billy Elliott' feeling suspicious of the rave reviews, saying, like Natalie Wood in 'Miracle on 34th St.': 'Yeah, yeah, I believe, I know it's silly but I believe.' My gosh, the reviews were right -- this is not a schmaltzy just feel good movie. It's even better then 'Brassed Off' as a working-class-and-the-arts-movie. It reminded me of my favorite scene in King Vidor's 'Our Daily Bread': 'Your contribution to the group will be giving violin lessons to our children.' (chokes me up every time I see that).The emotion is ratcheted up here because the miners are in the middle of the doomed anti-Thatcher strikes and the dancing kid is simply incredible. The story is told visually through his face, body language amidst the different pressures he's caught between, and that irrepressible dancing (though not comparable to be in Oscar contention vs. non-dancing adults). This isn't just about working class attitudes towards ballet and gays; their political and financial struggles are real, putting their bodies on the line for their solidarity and economic future.In the midst of being 'unfulfilled,' as even the middle class representatives are, is one kid's glimmer of something inconceivable--being different. And what that means in every way to every person who knows, and loves, him.The music's a surprise -- mostly T. Rex and the Clash.(originally written 11/5/2000)",10,1,2,19 December 2005
Finding Nemo," A Funny Joy!
","'Finding Nemo' is a complete joy! It shows the value of using character actors for voices, rather than bimbos and himbos whose faces you can't see anyway. Not only wonderful are Albert Brooks as a worry wart dad (that's not a fish species) and Ellen DeGeneres (whose character is clearly inspired by Ani Di Franco's song 'Little Plastic Castle': 'They say goldfish have no memory/I guess their lives are much like mine/and the little plastic castle/is a surprise every time/and it's hard to say if they're happy/but they don't seem much to mind.'), but we get to hear real Australian accents via Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana. Phil Procter (of Firesign Theater) was listed as one of the many ancillary voices -- my husband commented that he could have done all the voices.The side characters are more than charming -- surfer dude tortoises, 12-stepping sharks and dynamic interactions in a prison, er, aquarium. The references to old movies are very funny, including 'The Birds' and 'Psycho' (with credited use of that screechy music).As a dentist's daughter, though, I do protest the stereotypes about pain and tooth-pulling. And why do all Disney movies have to have a dead parent? But at least we didn't have to suffer through the usual schmaltzy ballads as surprisingly this isn't a musical. It's worth staying for all the credits as the amusing animation continues to the very end. Though the jokes should appeal to all ages, the toddler running loose in our theater was probably too young, until a character on screen shouted out 'You there, stop!' and she did, mesmerized wide-mouthed that the movie was talking to her, giving her mother time to catch her and take her outside.(originally written 6/15/2003)",10,1,3,22 December 2005
Alexander," Oliver Stone Manages to Make Colin Farrell Unsexy
","'Alexander' will be remembered is as the only movie that managed to make Colin Farrell, let alone Jared Leto and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, seem unsexy. No it's not because they are playing gay men (and they aren't bi-sexual -- Alexander only gets it up for a woman with a knife at his throat when he realizes he needs an heir). While the script makes several jabs at the film 'Troy' for portraying the Achilles/Patroclus relationship as familial rather than as lovers, at least that mess luxuriated in the male figure homo-erotically; this may be the only sword-and-sandals epic where almost the only part of hunky male anatomies we see are eyes and flowing hair. Russell Crowe was plenty sexy in 'Gladiator' with virtually no romantic scenes. The actor playing the young Alexander does look extraordinarily like Farrell, but the untying of the Gordian Knot is not presented as terribly exciting. Oliver Stone films are usually distinctive for their in-your-face editing, but only two battle scenes enliven the long story. And those mimic Christopher Doyle's color coded cinematography in 'Hero (Ying xiong),' as first one is covered in desert sand and the second in a forest of blood (and I did keep wondering how elephants were fitting between the trees in an Ewok-like terrain). Women, as usual in any Stone film, get short shrift but they are used more confusingly than his other work. Poor Rosario Dawson has to endure a naked scene that's violently animalistic before she turns into a nag - how can she whine about returning to Babylon when she's never been there? The casting of Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother made some sense in the early scenes of his childhood, but the decision not to age her twenty years is just annoying. We are perfectly capable of realizing their Oedipal relationship without having them appear as their actual comparable ages to make it creepier, let alone constantly surrounding her with snakes as some sort of inappropriate reference to Eve. Her Transylvanian accent just sounds silly, even if it fits into the geographical premise, though the occasional maps don't really help amidst the confused use of both ancient and contemporary geographical terms. I suppose it's a comment on the history of talking film that has portrayed Ancient Greeks as high class Brits that the Macedonians here all speak with variants of Farrell's Irish accent to indicate that they are usurpers. I was looking forward to the long movie finally ending with Alexander's death but no we had to suddenly endure what seemed like a half-hour flashback that was supposed to add mysterious motivations to the anti-climactic death scene and could just as easily have been put in chronological order.",Null,0,2,1 December 2004
The Others," Good Looking Spook Fest
","I spent the first half of 'The Others' ticking off how it was similar to Hitchcock's 'Rebecca' -- yeah, another isolated foggy Gothic mansion with secrets, another spooky, possibly crazy housekeeper, another high-strung lady of the house, and that this movie could also have been made in the late '40's.I got intrigued that first Nicole Kidman's character is sympathetic, then she's annoying, then a martinet, then sympathetic again (and looking great in close-fitting 1940's styles such that we should all have personal tailors like that, whew), in a fine performance as she carries the whole beautiful-looking movie.Then I tried to figure out what was really going on, started to pick up hints, got annoyed that some characters weren't giving us enough tips, tried to guess, got fooled by some things and appreciated what my friend spotted, and then just let myself go to the love-to-get-scared in all of us.

Troy," 2 Minutes of Eye Candy Brightens A Long, Stiff Epic
","My viewing of 'Troy' was helped by my son's exegesis, courtesy of two years of Ivy League reading of Dead White Men's civilization. He pointed out the legend of Troy isn't just based on Homer but also Virgil's 'The Aeneid,' among other sources for the Trojan Horse legend, and he approved of Aeneas's sudden appearance in the last few minutes of the film. As I haven't yet started my summer reading of Homer and Virgil, I'll depend on his comments.Paris's wimpiness was Homeric, especially in his use of the bow & arrow, as Homer strongly feels that archers are cowards and Real Men use spears and swords. Gee, and I thought it was Orlando Bloom being 'Legolas' again from 'Lord of the Rings.' All the best scenes - such as Hector saying farewell to his wife, the consequences of Achilles' cousin in battle, Priam begging for Hector's body (with Peter O'Toole wiping Brad Pitt off the screen with his acting)-- were straight outta Homer. The guy in front of me complained that a review he'd read 'had given away too much of the plot.' Gee, 3,000 years of literary analysis seems to have passed this guy by. But, then, as the arrow hits Achilles, there were a good portion of people who gasped and said 'Oh! His 'Achilles heel'!' I couldn't help laughing when Achilles bellowed for Hector as if that's where the word 'hectoring' must come from. Leaving out the quarreling gods' manipulations of humans leaves out a good part of the legend, but my husband thought a modern audience wouldn't buy magical excuses. People got killed off who didn't die in Homer just because the leaden screenplay had turned them into figures that the audience would want dead. Of course that would leave several Greek playwrights high and dry as they dealt a lot with the aftermath of Trojan War soldiers. I got a kick out of Helen and Paris's adultery being treated like the Tonkin Gulf incident as just an excuse for the king's imperialistic intentions. The effort to get us to sympathize with a young woman trapped in an arranged marriage to an older lout was weakened by the model's non-acting (yeah there's been a lot of jokes in reviews about how many ships this face deserved), but she managed to be quite heroic in her nude embrace against Paris's metal armor. Pitt's spoiled surfer dude is actually very close to Homer's portrait of Achilles, according to my son, and Homer did report on his constant squabbling with the king about a woman captive. As for me, I had no doubt that she wasn't going to resist Achilles when her first sighting of him is naked and covered in sweat and the blood of her fellow Trojans. I was wondering more if Brad's glistening, very impressive body could possibly really be all personal training and had any prosthetics as I don't recall any interviews with him during shooting that had him THAT muscle-bound.I did think the best parts of the movie were the 2 minutes altogether here and there of beefcake (including Eric Bana, who also movingly portrays Hector as a devoted family man, and a quickie shot of Bloom, though mores the pity none such of Sean Bean as Odysseus) that can wait to be seen until folks post screen shots on the Internet from the DVD, with the sound off so as not hear Pitt's wandering accent and ineffectual declamations. The major difference between this very long movie (after all the Trojan War did last some 10 years) and '50's sword-and-sandals epics is now the camera can go quite seductively a few inches lower on the hunks. The leaden directing tried to use the bombastic music to make the action move while the dialogue was just sillily stiff. I stayed through all the credits and wasn't surprised that I didn't recognize any of the special effects shops as the cheesy boats and soldiers looked like the old 'Jason and the Argonauts' movies, resonating like Pitt's voice-over in the cartoon 'Sinbad' last year. Along with the hand to hand combat, one of the few imitations of 'Gladiator' that almost works, Tanja Tzarovska and the Bulgarian Women's Choir do a fair imitation of Lisa Gerrard's Oscar-winning soundtrack contributions. As to Homer's stirring tale of war, politics, family, and loyalty that has echoed through millennia, the only lesson that all the women and at least 10% of the men will take away is that Achilles was eminently beddable. So if this film gets more people to use condoms, it will have been a success.",2,9,27,17 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," One of the Saddest, Most Heart Breaking Romantic Movies Ever Filmed
","'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the saddest, most heart breaking romantic movies ever made, without a drop of sentimentality or ounce of schmaltz.Director Ang Lee has created a direct descendant of John Ford's seminal Westerns. While filmed in Alberta standing in for Wyoming, rather than Ford's usual Monument Valley, the gorgeous landscape (credit to Rodrigo Prieto's lovely cinematography) and endless horizon of isolation recalls a West where John Wayne tried to shoot Natalie Wood for transgressive fraternizing in 'The Searchers' and the men of 'My Darling Clementine,' etc., were only free outdoors, beyond the confines of civilization. The camera adores the two handsome Marlboro Men at the center of the story from first shot, and throughout, as we see them draped over trucks, sheep, horses, campfires and each other.Enlivened by terrific acting, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story manages the difficult feat of communicating raw emotion through essentially inarticulate characters who first don't understand their feelings and then have no words to express them. Jake Gyllenhaal is almost as adorable as 'Jack Twist' as he was romancing Gwyneth Paltrow in 'Proof.' Even though his aging hair and make-up defeat him visually for a human saga that extends over 20 years (as well as Anne Hathaway's who literally ropes him into being her spouse), his growing maturity and self-realization is demonstrated to be hard-won. While we have seen the anxiety of the third leg of a triangle many times in stories of adultery or intermittently requited love, Gyllenhaal wears his passion, joy, hope, affection, longing and desperation on his face so transparently that the audience cannot help but be drawn into his palpable pain. But Heath Ledger takes conflicted masculinity to a new level, in a way that 'Jarhead' scrupulously avoided. As one of the aggressive women in their lives says in frustration as to why she's now with a new beau: 'He even talks.' Ledger's 'Ennis Del Mar' drawls a concession of 'Guess I wasn't much fun.' Her tearful riposte: 'Don't you understand that a woman doesn't fall in love with fun?' He creates a complete, taciturn, repressed, confused character from a hardscrabble life who tries to force himself to accept being fenced in by the strictures of Western expectations and codes of conduct towards both men and women. His character is totally overwhelmed when his feelings are unleashed and collide, and yet, can shine with exquisite tenderness in sweet romance. His performance leaves the audience exhausted in its pathos. While I've been a fan since his teen acting days, his brief scenes in 'Monster's Ball' only hinted that he was capable of this depth. He embodies tortured loneliness who has to sacrifice too much to learn that no man is an island. The film is movingly sensitive to the women in their lives and very sympathetic to the women being hornswoggled by adultery where they least expected it. Michelle Williams is a whirlwind as a naive girl who grows into an exhausted working mother suddenly faced with an explanation for the jarring disconnect in her marriage that will always be there through their shared children. (The men take seriously responsibility for procreative sex.) Her interactions with Ledger, in and out of bed, build to fraught climaxes.The musical leitmotif of the central relationship is repeated operatically relentlessly. The country music jukebox selections are adequate (Tammy Wynette's 'D-I-V-O-R-C-E' is a bit too obvious a choice), though the tracks on the soundtrack CD are beautiful but not apparent in the film. Over the credits, Willie Nelson croons a lovely take on Bobby Bare's traditional 'He Was A Friend of Mine' that ironically segues into Rufus Wainwright's 'The Maker Makes.' And when I got home the first song that popped up on the radio was Aretha Frankin belting 'I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You)' which seemed even more appropriate.",10,35,47,19 December 2005
Chicken Run," Hysterically Funny!
","What other movie could I take 10 relatives ranging in age from 10 to 55 in the midst of an extended family gathering weekend? So we piled into a discount matinée of 'Chicken Run' and we all laughed hysterically. By coincidence my son had recently seen 'The Great Escape' on cable so got that this was a satire, including of the theme song. And he had taken a course in swing music at college so got the satire of 'Jump, Jive and Wail' too. Mel Gibson did a surprisingly good voice-over, but the star voice is Julia Sawalha, the daughter 'Saffron' from 'Ab Fab.'This is not just for kids only, being hugely satisfying fun.And stay through the amusing credits (hey, I want to be a puppet wrangler! Or where else would you see a credit for a beak replacement coordinator?) for the continuing debate on which came first, the chicken or the egg.(originally written 7/4/2000)",10,7,11,21 December 2005
Insomnia," Not As Good as Original, But Still A Good, Dark Tale
","I erred in giving into temptation to watch the original Norwegian 'Insomnia' on IFC just a couple of weeks before seeing this Hollywood re-make directed by indie-credible 'Memento' Christopher Nolan with a very effective Academy Award-winning cast.The original movie had a tiny budget and also an excellent cast, led by the terrific Swede Stellan Skarsgård, growing as pale as that relentless sunshine during the course of the film; the usually haggard-looking Al Pacino interprets his insomnia visually through an ever more haggard face.Though the original film isn't given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely. The changes, though, are both subtle and significant and intriguingly as American as Sam Spade when the mise en scene gets moved to Alaska (actually shot in Vancouver). Significantly, there is less sex and more morality.Hilary Swank's character is more naive than her counterpart; Martin Donovan's character's role is more central to the story and, of course, Robin Williams gets more screen time than his original counterpart, as the conflict is less in the lead's mind and more on the screen as a duel. The plot twists are done differently so I shamefully got confused between the two movies.While not as overwhelming as the original, I do think this version should rank right up with the great detective/cop-does-the-right-thing movies, and the plot makes more sense than 'The Big Sleep.'(originally written 6/16/2002)",8,60,83,30 November 2005
X-Men," Effective Set Up for the Inevitable Sequels
","I have never read an X Men comic nor even heard them referred to in any medium until this 'X Men' movie came out. So I was really involved in the background exposition, which is most of the movie and is mostly a set up for the sequels. It was a bit much to start with the real environment of Nazi concentration camps in '44 and then somehow leap to the 'near future' rather than making the whole thing futuristic, but I'm sure other folks know if that's based in the comics.Hugh Jackman took over the whole movie in a star-making turn. Halle Berry surely won't be able to use this as an audition tape; I hope she at least made big bucks because she had zero to do. James Marsden fans will be similarly disappointed, though Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan get to sleepwalk and still emote.The sibling-like relationship between Jackman's Wolverine and Anna Paquin's Rogue is surprisingly touching, marred by an unnecessary ending comment that now she has a thing for him that he has to condescendingly put down. Hey, what's the matter with familial affection these days as a motivator?The fight scenes were a bit ho hum - - it was like a Sesame Street lesson in cooperation as each set of mutants gangs up on enemies to use their super mutant powers together. I kept thinking how much more intense and scary was the Statue of Liberty scene in Hitchock's 'The Saboteur' compared to this climax.The music was bombastic but effective. The only song really heard is Lucinda Williams in a bar jukebox.(originally written 8/4/2000)",7,0,0,13 December 2005
Match Point," A Beautiful Looking Pastiche of Many Films and Literary Works
","'Match Point' is such a pastiche of many films and literary works, some self-referentially preened, that I occupied myself identifying them throughout the movie. Starting with a repeating visual motif of tennis balls across the net recalling a classic image from 'Blow Up,' scenes at a Wimbledon-like club near the opening seem straight out of Evelyn Waugh, such as in 'Bright Young Things.' Two guys exchange a freighted conversation about loving opera I thought for sure was a coded gaydar filter so we'd be seeing them either on the down low or bi, especially as Matthew Goode is channeling a young Rupert Everett. But, no, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is more conventionally manipulative as we see him reading 'Crime and Punishment,' and the Penguin equivalent of Cliff Notes of Dostoevsky for analysis (and poshing up his native accent even as Goode keeps teasingly calling him 'Irish'). Courting is done, as in many references to Woody Allen's own 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,' by seeing old black and white movies during the day (portentously 'Rififi (Du rififi chez les hommes)') or foreign ones (ironically class-conscious 'The Motorcycle Diaries (Diarios de motocicleta)' with a rich girlfriend of an ambitious guy who makes quite different decisions) though this film actually focuses very little on Dreiser's class differentials of the similar 'American Tragedy').The setting is supposed to be contemporary, but other than some frank discussion of birth control and fertility treatments, these folks love opera and collect classic cars. Not an iPod in sight and computers are something mysteriously used at vague jobs. It would make sense if Penelope Wilton's tippling matriarch was the source of inherited wealth and Brian Cox's patriarch a wealthy business tycoon, recalling Edith Wharton, let alone F. Scott Fitzgerald, but that would make too much sense, as we're supposed to assume this is an old, inbred family. This seems to be parallel to Allen's oeuvre as 'Age of Innocence' is to Scorcese and 'Gosford Park' is to Altman's, but their period specificity added the weight of historical social changes to come that this film is lacking.Instead, what we get is basically another take on the character of 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' and Rhys-Meyers is much better than Matt Damon, as sexy as Alain Delon was in the 'Purple Noon (Plein soleil)' interpretation and far more emotional than both, in his lust and in his chutzpah. He dynamically carries the last part of the movie by creating the kind of villain where the whole audience first starts rumbling about him to each other and then yelling to him on the screen. His Bergman-like confrontation with ghosts, while visual, is far less effective than the moral and religious discussions in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors.'Up until her last few Shelley Winters-in-'A Place in the Sun'-channeling hysteria scenes, Scarlett Johansson has some of the smartest and sexiest seduction dialog in any of Allen's films. But her character stops making a lot of sense.Emily Mortimer pretty much plays the same love-lorn victim she did in 'Young Adam' and doesn't get to expand into the further tender vulnerability she projected in 'Lovely and Amazing.'With the film co-produced by BBC, it's nice to see wonderful actors from TV series such as 'Spooks (MI-5),' 'Murphy's Law' and 'Prime Suspect,' who add authenticity heft in small roles. The production design and music are way over the top. The continuous opera excerpts, sounding like they are playing from old '78's, are a change from Allen's usual jazz, but seem a forced exaggerated theatricality (even as Rhys-Meyers amusingly uses the decidedly more middle-brow mystery 'The Woman in White' as an alibi). With one of the characters interested in contemporary art, he is constantly surrounded by paintings that comment on his actions, such as a large red rooster emphasizing his cuckoldry and another with the word 'ache' writ large across it, etc.The best elements of the film are ironically visualizing the elements of luck and chance, as applied to tennis, fertility and life.This film looks beautiful and has nothing new to show or say.",5,2,5,13 January 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Visual But Very Gory Delight
","'Sleepy Hollow' was a visual delight--though I had to frequently turn away from the gory and very frequent decapitations and other bloody detail (which the teen boys in the audience thought were 'awesome') making it hard to keep eating my popcorn. I thought it odd that in a Dutch colonial town everyone spoke with a Brit accent (I guess Christina Ricci being younger was more Americanized), but I enjoyed seeing so many Masterpiece Theater grads, as it was shot on a London sound stage. Director Tim Burton switches from serious to camp and back, but the knowing script references defuse the gore, with a lot of tips-of-the-hat to 'The X Files,' and Johnny Depp's coward-alternating-with-hero is refreshing, borrowing a lot more from Edgar Allen Poe, the inventor of the detective novel, than Washington Irving.I think this could give young kids nightmares.(originally written 11/21/1999)",7,1,2,12 December 2005
Hotel Rwanda," As Powerful and Moving as 'Schindler's List'
","'Hotel Rwanda' masterfully humanizes the enormity of the Rwandan genocide by focusing on the sane humanity of one man and his family when the whole world around them has gone insane. It ranks with 'Schindler's List' as a film and a statement of the potential for action when faced with man's inhumanity to man.It is not just Don Cheadle's superb inhabitation of the real life hero Paul Rusesabagina that makes this film captivating. Co-writers Keir Pearson and director Terry George (who has previously shown through Irish films his understanding of fratricidal civil war engendered by colonialism) do more than guide us step-by-step through the facts of a few horrific days in 1994.We also see the transformation of a man who had benefited in an ironic oasis of a four-star Belgian tourist resort as a proud Hutu accomodationist to elitism, corruption and racism. Less a docudrama like 'Bloody Sunday,' this is gripping story telling of personal relationships, quick thinking and moral responsibility.The film is not only edge of your seat suspense on the roller coaster of events to know what happens next to people we get to know (Sophie Okonedo has magical chemistry with Cheadle in portraying his spirited Tutsi wife) but also full of the humor, pathos and individuality of human foibles and emotions.The wider background to the situation is explained very quickly in passing to a photojournalist moved to care, played by Joaquin Phoenix, as a legacy of racist Belgian rule that sounds like the plot of a classic episode from the original 'Star Trek,' so is even the more shocking for being true.We've seen before the agonizing futility of 'the whole world is watching' hope in films going back to 'Ship of Fools,' here painfully racist as well, and we've seen films about incomprehensible African strife through the eyes of sympathetic white witnesses that come across like 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' Revelatory are how the African vs. African tensions are demonstrated, not only the culminating tsunami of violence (the visual gore is minimized such that seeing dead bodies, particularly of children, to the horizon is effectively stomach-turning enough so we don't need to see close-ups of machete wounds), but we are caught up in the build-up to the tensions, the humiliating negotiations to try and maintain civilized behavior, the class clashes, tribal treachery, and the specter of future repercussions, all scarily recreated.The U.N. peacekeepers, represented by Nick Nolte, are presented more positively, and not as helpless, as their bitter depiction in Yugoslavia in as 'No Man's Land.' The ever-present ranting radio, whose managers have been accused of war crimes, is a frighteningly heard presence in orchestrating the horror.The closing song, 'Million Voices' by Wyclef Jean, sounds quite much like Peter Gabriel's tributes to Stephen Biko and Nelson Mandela, but the Afro Celt Sound System's score well exemplifies the movie's theme of a bitter tragedy for African and European cultures.",Null,2,3,18 January 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Amusing Fluffy Nonsense
","'Ocean's 12' may not represent the end of American civilization that so much money is spent on such a trifle, but can be seen as a profitable export of the U.S. No animals were harmed in the making of the film, people were employed around Europe, no acting skills were taxed but most of them are American citizens so presumably pay U.S. taxes so the Treasury benefits. I just hope everyone involved from Steve Soderbergh to George Clooney et al do some indie or charitable work so their karma makes up for this lighter than air romp.Soderbergh's exceptional directorial,editing and cinematographic skills were put to such better use in 'Traffic.' The actors basically have to just show up, which George Nolfi's script even makes fun of, as each character pretty much plays self-referential satires of themselves and their personas-including Brad Pitt preening in tight silk shirts and expensive cars, Matt Damon spoofing his all-competent Bourne by being a bumbling apprentice, Clooney's age vanity, climaxing in making an explicit joke of Julia Roberts, but heck it's breezily funny.At one point the characters ask each other if they have a moral objection to the nonsense going on and there's a funny moment's hesitation before they and we enjoying the showthink, nah.Best are the even shorter cameos, Topher Grace, Albert Finney, Robbie Coltrane, Cherry Jones who add some ballast as otherwise the story is so light weight that a couple of times it threatens to blow away. The Bruce Willis cameo adds to the silliness but it does work.It is hard to watch all the energy Catherine Zeta-Jones's 'Europol' cop puts into catching thieves when one hopes that in real life Interpol is working on catching terrorists. I suppose we can all rest easy that Osama's folks don't have these thieves' skills so that therefore we can sit back and enjoy this 007 for civilians, a world where master thieves are so bored they pretty much have to keep occupied by stealing from each other. Too bad real life is showing us that thievery is really so much easier than it's shown here, from Enron to the Tate Gallery.It is staggering the number of assistants each actor required, let alone hair dressers, so I think it worth noting that I really don't like Damon and Pitt with buzz cuts and Zeta's long wig in one scene is really bad.The charming score keeps things moving right along. Was it another self-referential joke, perhaps in the Utah moments, that one of the many incidental songs was written by Senator Orin Hatch so that he'll financially benefit from this silly export?",5,1,4,11 December 2004
Crash," A Tense Tearjerker -- As You Cry Out of Despair
","Yes, 'Crash' is theatrical and full of coincidences, in an 'Amores Perros' roundelay as people from a broad array of races and classes are set off by the contact of their cars and then their stereotyped perceptions of each other to bounce off each other.But with this concentrated yet diverse group writer/director Paul Haggis is able to represent sprawling Los Angeles in a manageable and searingly effective ensemble, and show up how non-diverse most movies and TV series are.The initiating premise is similar to Lawrence Kasdan's 1991 'Grand Canyon,' but that film looks sunnily optimistic and Utopian compared to race relations in L.A. today, in a city where people don't even have to rub shoulders with each other on mass transit. From the superficial exteriors of race, gender, dress and language, each character instantly judges the others out of context, usually to devastating consequences; the layers are pulled back as each is rubbed raw by their contact with the other.Each action leads to unpredictable consequences that unexpectedly affect another person and no good deed goes unpunished. No one is left unscarred, though not everyone learns a lesson from their experiences, from the most naive (Ryan Philippe putting his preternatural baby face to good effect for a rookie cop) to the most jaded (Don Cheadle using a whole new body language than his other films for his police detective). Every character has flaws, either from their past or present, and almost none are quite the stereotype they seem at first, especially as each is pushed in unexpected directions to do unpredictable actions.Virtually the entire ensemble is note perfect, particularly Terrence Dashon Howard as an African-American man who quickly adjusts (and misadjusts) his style to fit into his various social environments. Sandra Bullock has surprising dramatic authority, even if her character is less revelatory than the others, and Brendan Fraser as her husband has the only one-note of less credibility as a too young and too stiff district attorney.The language is frank and lacerating in its confrontations, bordering on Mamet and LaBute territory for its bluntness about American society, but I never cry at those playwrights' works and I cried here out of hopelessness and despair.Oddly, the soundtrack selections make little ironic note of the Christmas season setting, but there is some quiet commentary of each character listening to separate songs, such as hip hip or country, to subtly indicate the different musical environment they create around themselves (but not, Lyle Lovett's 'L.A. County' though his music would have been more appropriate here than in 'The Interpreter'). There is also the ethereal world music that Haggis used similarly atmospherically in his groundbreaking 'E Z Streets' television series.I saw the film with an integrated, multi-ethnic audience in Queens, NY that in the first half reacted in turn in support of seeing themselves represented on the screen, but throughout the second half was dead silent. This film will make for good discussion groups, particularly in contrast to Spike Lee's 'Do The Right Thing' as that phrase takes on many more layers here. I do wonder what input the cast had in the dialog; if Haggis had used a Mike Leigh-style involvement, such as with 'Vera Drake,' the language could be assured of authenticity as well as electricity.",9,0,7,2 June 2005
Snatch," Amusing Crime Story
","I went to see 'Snatch' by accident due to confusion over movies listings. I haven't seen 'Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels' so I can't say how similar 'Snatch' is. It seemed like 'Lavender Hill Mob' crossed with Woody Allen and 'Run Lola Run' and contemporized by language and 'Pulp Fictio'nal violence and circular storytelling. My friend thought it was very music video style. The ethnic references were vaguely unsettling, including Benicio Del Toro's exaggerated Yiddish accent and a prominent menorah in the diamond dealer's office -- oh yeah we Jews all keep Hanukkah ritual objects around the office. But gypsies (or maybe they were Irish Travelers) were probably also unsettled at being used for jokes.I did like that the American movie stars were secondary to the Brit character actors and there's no corny romance.It is an amusing hour and a half or so.

The Beach," Beautifil Looking Update of Heart of Darkness/Lord of the Flies
","'The Beach' is 'Lord of the Flies' about 20somethings who have seen 'Apocalypse Now' (it's referred to visually and aurally) but don't seem to have read 'Heart of Darkness' which inspired it, and which this is basically with a bit of sex and/or desire added (I didn't read the book but the reviews say that wasn't in the Garland book either.)'Deer Hunter' is also brought to mind with its view of Asian cities and exotic risks; 'Return to Paradise' takes the same milieu for a much higher moral purpose. I did like the irony of using Leo in one of the sex scenes as just a straight business service deal. The camera also loves Leo and Boyle ramps up the story line with visuals almost as dazzling as in his 'Trainspotting,' particularly with the frequent references and visualizations of video games.Leo here reminds me of how Jane Fonda would be used in her movies, as the naive American or outsider who gradually learns a lesson in sophistication that the rest of the jaded world already knows. The descent is a bit too swift and not 100% believable.Tilda Swinton is terrific as the leader, though I guess her stupid lug of a boyfriend is just good in bed. Robert Carlyle is briefly in it but is quite memorable and as usual incomprehensible. That man should just walk around with subtitles.The cinematography is gorgeous, but I think it would be hard to ruin the scenery.The soundtrack is lovely and surprisingly too is the electronica.

Closer," Hollywood Stars Using Lacerating Words as Sexual Weapons
","'Closer' seems more about guys and sex than about relationships.It is less a contemporary (including very blunt Internet chat) London take on 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,' though there is a similar running theme of truth, lies and mutual fantasies, than a journey into Neil LaBute's scabrous territory where trust can't survive and male careers have a parallel with their possession of females. At least the women are in stronger positions than they were in at the time of Mike Nichols' 'Carnal Knowledge.' This film does make one wonder if the traditional practice of arranged marriages might not be as least as effective as love in serving as a basis for long-term relationships.As a four-hander, it is weakened that Natalie Portman's and Clive Owen's performances blow Julia Roberts and Jude Law away. Owen's character is the showier male, with his hang-ups of rough sex fantasies and obsession with women as whores, while Law's character has some sort of mild mother complex.Similarly, Portman's character is the more intriguingly independent female, recognizing the strengths and limitations of her sexual power over men she does and doesn't love, including passersby in the very naturally ironic closing shots. She is finally the most sympathetic character who we comparatively care about the most.While Roberts almost manages to keep up, Law may be ill-served by the script. His character is practically two different people, one with one woman where he unsuccessfully tries to disappear from his physical beauty, another with the other where he uses it. He enacts them differently with different body language and props, but no motivation is obvious for his changes.Nichols' directing is very involving, effectively opening up a play by opening up spaces, settings and locations. I don't know if the adaptation from the original had to account for the cast, but the script nicely incorporated explanations for having American women in London, as well as Natalie's youthfulness.What didn't work was inconsistent changes in make-up and hair that did not support dialogue claims of a passage of time, as much as even three or four years between scenes, but nothing much changes in how they look, except occasionally for Portman's hair styles.While it's a bit tiresomely arch having Law's character be a wannabe writer, Roberts' character as a photographer works very well for visualization, though her character's motivations are as inscrutable as her portraits.Having a superstar cast as a Hollywood movie adaptation distributed in multiplexes causes audience problems as they were made very uncomfortable by the extremely blunt language, which wouldn't have caused as much of a ruffle in an art house audience, but audiences are just not used to watching these folks talk like this; Oprah's audience on a recent promotion for the film was so nonplussed that Roberts' joked that she had to learn these words for the film. I think independent films have been rated NC-17 for similar language. The language is so lacerating we think we are seeing more explicitness than we are.The music selections are very effective, from the opening use of Damien Rice's 'The Blower's Daughter' with its repeating chorus of 'I can't take my eyes off of you/I can't take my mind off of you.' But the repeating use of opera for inspiration and dates didn't really make sense for the characters and seemed more to indicate either an avoidance of time passage or that Nichols is out of touch with contemporary culture.At least the strip joint played appropriate music. During Natalie's strip tease I kept thinking of Oprah asking her what her dad would think of that scene and she wryly responding that he's a gynecologist.",8,5,11,11 December 2004
Elf," Delightfully Funny Valentine to Christmas in New York
","'Elf' is a laugh-out-loud with a tear-in-your-eye charming, updated tribute to one of my favorite movies 'Miracle on 34th Street,' much better than the tepid actual re-make. Here, the plot turns in a now-vanished Gimbel's, but the family in much need of 'faith means believing in something even when your common sense tells you not to' again lives in an apartment on the Upper West Side overlooking Central Park. While I couldn't tell from the credits just how much was actually filmed in NYC vs. Vancouver, I'll credit whatever it does, as it is such a Valentine to Christmas in New York, to mix holidays. While Ed Asner makes me believe that he too thinks that Edmund Glenn really was Santa Claus, it is Will Ferrell's consistent wide-eyed innocence that carries the movie. The product placements do get annoying, but mostly serve the script. Who knows if director Jon Favreau, who also has a cameo role, punched-up debut writer David Berenbaum's script, but it is delightful.Zooey Deschanel is a sweetheart, while James Caan and Mary Steenburgen just pretty much get to reprise their TV roles, in, respectively, 'Las Vegas' and 'Joan of Arcadia.'The visual references to other movies are amusing, from the Disney-like animation at the North Pole to treating the Urban Park Rangers like the Dark Riders from 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.'The holiday song selections are mostly classic, though it's nice to hear new Leon Redbone interpretations on two tracks.(originally written 1/19/2004)",9,9,19,28 October 2005
Capote," A Slow But Chilling Portrayal of The Toll It Took To Understand the Horror
","'Capote' opens up as a ghostly recreation. Trepidation and dread haunt the screen from the glimpses of the crime scene, deep in the heartland (Manitoba beautifully standing in for Kansas) where we gradually become aware of violence frozen in isolation, recalling that this crime helped set up the template for portrayals of horror.The sudden shift to Truman Capote's milieu in New York City is a jarring juxtaposition but is equally spooky because with Philip Seymour Hoffman's brilliantly uncanny portrayal we are literally seeing an apparition. While it is a bit frustrating at first as we get almost no insight into what attracted Capote to the story, especially as we see the details of him getting organized, embarking on a long train ride into his heart of darkness and being initially brushed off by the locals, but the pay off eventually comes, if very slowly.There's initial jokes on the puffed-up dandy in anti-wonderland who owes a great debt to his old Southern friend the soon to be noted novelist Harper Lee (a no nonsense Catherine Keener) for regularly puncturing his pretenses and briskly bridging the cultural gap so he can begin worming his way into the community's trust (and getting condescended to in return about her book and the movie adaptation and dryly dismissed by his lover as more 'manly' than he is). I didn't start to take seriously that the point of the film was 'In Cold Blood's effect on him until we see him sneak into the funeral home and start to psychologically absorb the murders and challenge folks to take him seriously despite his way of talking and affected mannerisms.A key transitional scene is almost bizarre when Capote's fame does help him here, as the wife of Chris Cooper's solid, clear-eyed, suspicious sheriff, Amy Ryan in a very atypical for her '50's housewife role, gushes over the writer in their midst (even though his books had been banned from the local library) and brokers credibility to get him crucial, exclusive contact with the still not charmed investigators and, suddenly, with one of the murderers. Amidst perfect recreations of the late '50's, we see Capote learn to manipulate his fame to get him further access, that is a harbinger of celebrity journalists to come.The film then shifts to an extended 'Dead Man Walking' chapter, as Capote enters into a symbiotic relationship with Perry Smith, seductively and captivatingly played by Clifton Collins Jr, particularly in the build up to trying to understand the actual crime. We see Capote begin to develop a new kind of journalism even before he writes a word as he gets personally involved in the physical, mental and legal health of the murderers -- all for the benefit of his book. Key actions of his recall the cynical reporter in Billy Wilder's acerbic 'Ace in the Hole (The Big Carnival),' first released eight years before these events, as we see Capote intentionally lie, manipulatively get involved and selectively let out bits and pieces of his own past to get others to trust and confide in him. His life itself becomes a nonfiction novel.But the last chapter of the film goes into unique territory, as we see the two worlds Capote has been experiencing collide in his head and take a toll on his relationships, productivity and health. The completion of the book has a relentless parallel with the cycles of justice and legal revenge with no spiritual release, just a book release, and self-aggrandizement, even as he invents a new form of personal reportage to great acclaim. The film searingly emphasizes the internal haunting Capote experiences, with his photographic recall, by leaving out that he did continue the public appearance of his wild ways, as 1966 was also the year of his notorious black and white masquerade ball. The atmospheric music heightens the spooky feeling that there's more happening below the surface and helps keep us thinking. The cinematography is exquisite throughout.",8,10,15,31 October 2005
Lost in Translation," A Sweet Week as A Fish-out-of-Water in a Strange Land
","'Lost in Translation' is non-categorizable, as it finds the human touch between identity crises of both middle age and young adulthood. 
Sofia Coppola has sensitively written and carefully visualized a very subtle story that ranges from out and out comic to immensely touching.
Who would have thought that in this day and age another big city could seem so foreign and in a McDonald's world that cultures seem so far apart, but she does this for Tokyo and Japanese culture vs. us with the lead characters.  The fish-out-of-water feel for Japan, from its most refined high culture and religion to its low life and pop silliness, becomes a wonderful visual metaphor for how we feel out of place in our own skins as we change as individuals and within personal relationships. (I doubt this film will work overseas.) The imdb credits don't match the ones listed in the film that her brother Roman was the Tokyo unit director, but the dreamy look is similar to Sofia's opposite suburban environment in 'Virgin Suicides,'  which he also worked on.  Key music on this soundtrack is again by the band Air, here 'Alone in Kyoto.' Scarlett Johansson has captured the camera for me since 'Manny and Lo,', but she's now the same age Bacall was when she burst on the screen and the voice now matches the sultry look. Bill Murray bravely takes on references to his past work, from the lounge singer in 'Saturday Night Live' to a clip of some forgettable flick, as he enlivens a fading Hollywood star.  (I never thought of him as particularly tall, but his towering above the Japanese is a continuing joke.)  Notably, their spouses are not portrayed as out and out buffoons or uncaring clods, but are trying to make up for communication problems in their own ways, adding to the tensions with their bumbling, well-meaning efforts to revive the relationships while the two leads become closer and closer in their ability to communicate, particularly through silences and looks. 
Keanu Reeves is thanked in the credits, doubtless for permission to use his first name in reference to a satirical scene that pokes fun at 'his' bimbo co-star on a press junket for a fictive action film.  This touch is one of many that are unpredictable in this sweet movie about a week in the lives of two people who are probably changed forever.",Null,0,0,21 September 2003
Empire of the Sun," A Stunning Child's Eye View of the Clash of Colonial Empires
","I viewed 'Empire of the Sun' on DVD as the first of Steven Spielberg's twentieth century historical films. In an interview on the DVD, he proclaims it to be a 'child's view of war,' linking it to his 'E.T.'- oeuvre and predictively to his violent films to come, but it is unexpectedly about something else.It is a child's view of the tectonic clash of colonial empires, as the one upon which the sun never sets (the British) is dimmed by the rising sun (the Japanese), with them both trumped by the even brighter artificial sun of the U.S.'s super atom and economic power. For the boy, the continuing visual symbols for nature and man are the sun lots of beautiful sun rises, broiling noons and sunsets-- and airplanestoys, bombers, ruins, kamikazes and rescuers.Through the autobiographical fiction of J.G. Ballard's original novel (and it is interesting to hear on the DVD interview what incidents are directly from his life), we start out seeing a Rudyard Kipling-like view of China. In this first act, we see arrogant, elitist Europeans hold court in an International Zone separated from the teaming poverty of Shanghai (and the filmmakers eerily recreate the original boundaries in the exact locale through the contemporary imperialism of Hollywood capitalism) that seems more pre-World War I than II. The added touch of having them dress up for a masquerade ball like Marie Antoinette, etc. is too heavy-handed.While the adaptation is by Tom Stoppard, the film then becomes all about young Christian Bale's performance, in a Robert Louis Stevenson-like boy's adventure tale, and stunning visual set pieces by cinematographer Allen Daviau.Bale is extraordinary. Watching him 20 years later, it is fascinating to see the mature actor within the child who even at this young age can produce boyish enthusiasm to desperation to exhaustion at the crack of 'Action.' Some of his best scenes are simply he alone, such as a resourceful kid who seems like a lone post-war survivor when he first misses the round-ups of Europeans.It is probably because we are looking through his innocent eyes that the Japanese are shown far less stereotypically than most such movies, particularly as he establishes a tentative connection with a youthful flier (though through his young confusion distinctions between Chinese and Japanese are unfairly not clear). His youthful resiliency is a remarkably fresh take on war time conditions as he adapts to any situation and learns enough to help others as well as himself, recalling John Boorman's 'Hope and Glory' that was released the same year.A complete tonal shift occurs when he suddenly meets up with Americans who obviously recall characters from 'Catch 22', marvelously played by a scheming John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano as his side kick. It was very effective that we only hear them for many minutes before we see their faces, as we perceive them from the child's angle in hearing the clear distinctions from his upbringing in their styles, culture and language. (I only found out from the DVD interviews that their characters were stranded Merchant Marines as I didn't pick that up from the dialog.) The practicality of the Americans is coolly emphasized in one harrowing scene when they take bets on whether Bale's 'Jim' will survive a chase.Miranda Richardson is notably not a stereotype. Just as Malkovich is an extremely reluctant paternal protector for Bale, Richardson is neither a snob nor maternal.The art direction and images then take over, overwhelming any theme about the absurdities of war or clashes or complements of cultures, from the increasingly desperate internment camp to an Allied attack to a useless march to another encampment filled with the luxurious detritus of the imperialists. Even as the exact time span is only indicated indirectly and the body count mounts, by the end we are seeing one striking tableau after another.British civilization seems too easily restored at the end after all we've seen.",8,4,9,13 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Filling Up the Screen to Finish The Series Up Already
","'Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones' was really, really loud, which helped to drown out the noisy kids. Because several weeks into the run the four screens playing it hourly were still quite crowded with an old-fashioned genuinely family audience of all ages. And shucks if the opening lettering and music didn't choke me up with nostalgia (including for Mel Brooks' 'Space Balls').I did like the action scenes with all the whooshes, even if they weren't particularly original. But I had to keep reminding myself that Samuel Jackson, Natalie Portman (the beading designer on her costumes deserved the prominent listing in the credits), Temuera Morrison (so combustible in 'Once Were Warriors'), Ewen MacGregor (hey, why does this Jedi have to be celibate?), etc. are terrific actors because I couldn't figure out why they were so stiff and uninteresting. Yeah I did watch some stupid series on Pax TV I think it was because Hayden Christensen had caught my eye, so I sat there pretending I cared about his romance as much as I had about Han's and Leia's, because I really did with the original trilogy.I did like the little precursor information for fans -- like of the aunt and uncle on Tatooine as a young couple, a cameo by the evil emperor, and the trick on our decades-old expectations of who and what the clones would be.I'm not sure I could sit through this a second time, but it does pay to see the effects on the big screen.(originally written 5/28/2002)",5,3,7,13 December 2005
Corpse Bride," Charming Animated Musical
","'Corpse Bride' is one of the best animated musicals since 'Beauty and the Beast.' Danny Elfman is co-creative force with director Tim Burton, as the delightful songs, music and piano playing courtships match the distinctive ensemble of characters. There are no schmaltzy Disney ballads as the songs, sung by the character ensemble, help to reinforce plot and character points. While the songs aren't classics, they are hummable. With a few more additions, Elfman could turn it into a theatrical production. Each character has delightfully exaggerated features (who didn't want to cut Johnny Depps's drooping forelock off during the Academy Awards?). The crowded Victoriana setting is as fraught with visual possibilities as 'Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)' and Hogwarts in Harry Potter. The color scape is almost all moon-lit black, gray and blue. The film is charming and funny from the opening through its smidgen too long 76 minutes (though I didn't stay through the credits). The stream of visual jokes and one-liners may go over kids' heads, such as the head waiter. The tributes to old movies also come fast and furious, from the Harryhausen piano to 'The Gone With the Wind' satire, the Heckle and Jeckle dream sequence from 'Dumbo', 'Barkis Bittern' seems to look a lot like an older 'Gaston' from 'Beauty' or maybe 'Dudly Do-Right,' and more. The Peter Lorre-imitating maggot was a bit much. This isn't the first time we've seen dem bones dance around in animation but this is once again with a lot of feeling. Christopher Lee voices the minister marvelously and Helena Bonham Carter enlivens the title character.What's particularly lovely is that none of the characters are really nasty and the magical romantic triangle is resolved with no cruelty.",7,6,11,28 September 2005
Bridget Jones's Diary," Very Weak, though Amusing, Update of Jane Austen
","I haven't read the book of 'Bridget Jones's Diary' so I was both surprised and disappointed in the movie. Disappointed because no way does it do for 'Pride and Prejudice' what 'Clueless' did for 'Emma' as modern-day Jane Austen, even with Colin Firth as a literally contemporary Darcy.Disappointed as well with Renee Zellweger's bland, generic British accent (hey I watch British TV shows so I can be attuned enough to the geographic variety of British conversation) and her bloomingly healthy good looks are just too American or even Australian.But it is fun to see Hugh Grant as a cad and the slapstick and embarrassing situations are laugh out loud funny. But the timing could be tighter and there's too many easy choices.The soundtrack is only 50% effective. For every on-target commentary by Aretha or Chaka, there's a smarmy ballad that turned out to be Robbie Williams or some other flaky Brit popster. And I'm Van Morrison's #1 fan, but yet another movie that ends with an old Van the Man love song?(originally written 4/29/2001)",3,1,3,6 December 2005
10 Things I Hate About You," Stiles and Ledger Carry a Cute Romantic Comedy
","'10 Things I Hate About You' is not as cleverly written as 'Clueless' in modernizing a classic. But leads Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger (he of TV's 'Roar' on Fox a couple of years ago) have wonderful chemistry that carries the movie (and into the out takes over the credits). They are that good that the movie's worth seeing as sheer romantic fun even when 'Taming of the Shrew' is dropped half-way through for a more conventional teen movie.Finding this amazing high school in Tacoma cost them $1 million extra than shooting in L.A. but was really worth it. It's hard to believe such a school exists.One knows that this will just be a summer romance - I sort of see this as a prequel to John Sayles' 'Baby It's You.'It makes good use of the subtleties of music battles in high school. This was the second movie I saw in a week where a guy woos a girl by pretending to be into grrrl rock ('Mad Love' was the other, on cable). Letters to Cleo are (is?) featured prominently.

The Aviator," A Vivid Portrayal of a Crippled Colossus
","While 'The Aviator' is Martin Scorsese as a for-hire director, he barrels into it with the same visual zeal for exposing the surface excesses and tragic consequences of unbridled capitalism of 1930's/'40's Hollywood and the aviation industry that he did for the Gilded Age of 'Age of Innocence' and the Las Vegas of 'Casino.' There is more than a passing resemblance to 'Citizen Kane' in story arc and style as the outsider millionaire Howard Hughes seizes the popular imagination to take on The Establishment of the media moguls, business competition and the Congress while bedding stars and battling personal demons amidst a loyal coterie. The metaphors come together in a foreboding scene within the klieg lights of a Hollywood premiere as Hughes, with Jean Harlow on his arm in a cameo by Gwen Stefani, is blinded by light bulbs that crash onto a red carpet strewn with broken glass and is too deafened to partake in PR banter.From the opening shots of the making of 'Hell's Angels' Scorsese ties together the two improbable if it weren't true twin obsessions of Hughes, movies and airplanes, so we also see the source of the director's interest in the project. Scorsese's love of old movies comes through as he really gets into Hughes's upstart movie-making techniques outside the studio system and the ratings board. There's almost too many movie clips (though I've seen interviews where Scorsese's descriptions of the airplane footage in the original 'Hell's Angels' are more thrilling than what's actually re-created here), but they serve as a haunting backdrop for Hughes's deterioration as he silhouettes against replays of his films like Gloria Swanson in 'Sunset Boulevard.' Leonardo DiCaprio is surprisingly and astoundingly effective as he wouldn't naturally seem to resemble the imposing Hughes. Perhaps that's why Scorsese uses an unusual, for him, number of close-ups which emotionally work as an entrÃ©e to Hughes's perceptions, enthusiasms and psychological problems. While DiCaprio is aided by excellent make-up and hair styling as he ages and the character matures and changes, the accent, body language, tortured expressions and seductive intensity are all his. The movie powerfully shows how involved the self-taught Hughes was in the design of his innovative planes and his gutsy piloting. I hope DiCaprio's youth appeal will bring in younger audiences, as the few in the audience I saw it with were clueless about the historical figures and references in the film.I was leery of anyone taking on Katharine Hepburn so I was surprised not only how good Cate Blanchett was but even more surprised by her chemistry with DiCaprio, which I thought originally was as odd a casting pairing, as well, Hughes was with Hepburn. They really make it work, both together and in a fast-talking dinner with her intellectual, politically active Yankee family.Alan Alda is terrific as the corrupt senator, but I was surprised that he had his New York accent rather than adopt a Down East one as he was supposed to be a Maine senator. Even in comparison to the climactic Senate hearings in 'The Godfather,' this ping pong conflict is exciting, helped by the exaggerated production design and theatrical lighting that reflects how Hughes sees the match up in his shaky mental state. (There's no hearing room in Congress that large or would have photographers that close.) Also in the ensemble Alec Baldwin and John C. Reilly are almost too restrained as, respectively, the Pan Am CEO and Hughes's COO. Ian Holm is delightful in a very small part that helps to show how Hughes kept around him a small group of loyalists who enabled his eccentricities. Jude Law as Erroll Flynn is a cameo and seems to be there only to represent the conventionally dissolute Hollywood as opposed to Hepburn and Hughes being in a parallel trajectory.Kate Beckinsale is just pretty and has none of Ava Gardner's earthy presence nor brazenness. Even though she talks frankly, she is not a tough dame and she just seems to be playing dress-up in the extravagant period costumes.Sandy Powell's period costumes are wonderful, even the men's clothes are eye-catching in how they set off the actors' bodies, yet are stylistically appropriate.The production design is a bit over the top, but it emphasized how outsized Hughes's environment was, as a billionaire controlling a huge airplane factory and airline and as a Hollywood arriviste in the glamorous nightlife. The flying special effects, particularly of the breathtaking Beverly Hills crash, fit the overall tone.The cinematography is ravishing, over a wide variety of settings and environments.As usual for a Scorsese film the period song selections are superb. Stay through the credits to hear a Leadbelly song about Hughes. It's fun to see both Rufus and Loudon Wainwright as nightclub entertainers. Howard Shore's score is a bit overpowering, but does work with the exhilarating aerial shots.",9,16,33,1 January 2005
The Bourne Identity," Fast-Paced Hollywood Thriller
","'The Bourne Identity' was a quite good TV mini-series with Richard Chamberlain that didn't really need re-making. But with all the strife I read about that went into this re-make, it's actually a pretty serviceable Hollywood thriller. Franka Potente, so good in Tom Tykwer's German movies where she got to do a lot more, has some chemistry with Matt Damon, though Clive Owen, who has a tiny part here, would have done more complexity with the role than Damon does.But, heck, if the point of having a new hunk in the role is to get women's fannies in the multiplex seats, more romance would have been nice; evidently Damon thought that interrupted the flow of the story so demanded it be taken out.Well, the story does in fact make more sense than most such Hollywood thrillers. I guess we'll see the deleted scenes on the DVD. (originally written 7/14/2002)",7,0,1,22 December 2005
The Italian Job," Pretty and Light weight
","I missed at least 10 minutes of the beginning of 'The Italian Job' due to wrong times in the listings, but I seem to have gotten there just in time for any of the key plot points that were referred to later in the movie.This is a breezy robbers vs. robbers movie with none of the character gravitas nor noir sexual tension of 'The Good Thief' or even the cute interplays and dialog of a similarly re-made 'Ocean's 11.'The chase scenes are very entertaining in neat surroundings, but with little of the life-and-death suspense of 'Ronin' or 'French Connection,' maybe because all that's involved is money, ho hum, whether it's $35 million or $27 million.Maybe because Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are just too light-weight here. Edward Norton is wasted as a one-dimensional villain; even Wahlberg's character disparages him as lacking imagination. At least for once a distinction is made between Ukrainian and Russian criminals.There's a fun cover version of Pink Floyd's 'Money' by Scott Weiland, Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum (last 3 are ex-members of Guns 'N' Roses) in the movie twice at least, but is NOT on the soundtrack CD.It is nice to see that the robbers' goal is to catch an Amtrak train; public and freight transportation could use the plug.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Bring the Magic Back to Movies
","Seeing 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' made me feel like a kid again, bringing me back to 1958 watching 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad' with Ray Harryhausen's heroic special effects. 'LOTR' claims its rightful place as one of the founts of inspiration for 'Star Wars,' with its conflicted good guys up against a growing stronger evil -- that resonates in a post-9/11 world as it must have for Tolkien post-WWI and concurrent with WWII (and eerily like HBO's 'Band of Brothers').The cast of Brits, Americans and Antipodeans (including obscure favorites of mine from Brit TV and indie movies) team up amidst special effects that are thrilling yet comprehensibly old-fashioned. In terms of comparing it to the book, I'm one of possibly two or three Baby Boomers who didn't read 'The Hobbit' and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' until this month (and will wait to complete the rest of the cycle in time for the following two movies), so I was both fresher to the material and less fanatical about it than some, including clarifications of some bits that I had misunderstood in the book.I appreciated some of the telescoping of details (such as combining the elf princess Arwen, as played by Liv Tyler, with a legendary princess' love story) and missed others (by leaving out Tom Borondil and his mate the River's Daughter, the brightness of nature is left out, making for a darker movie than even the book). The endless exposition in the book is handled well, as both voice overs and through flash-back demonstrations. The final DVD will include deleted scenes.Particularly well-handled is graphically showing the tempting danger of the Ring's evil power, on others and on Frodo -- a key difference in the mature themes of 'LOTR' in comparison to 'The Hobbit.'I was disappointed that the songs and mythic poetry were barely replaced by Enya's hardly noticeable background music.(originally written 12/29/2001)",10,3,5,13 December 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Unimaginative, Tired Conclusion to the Trilogy
","'The Matrix: Revolutions' devolves the trilogy into conventional sci fi, with very expensive special effects that go on and on.I would have liked more imagination -- the evil machines sure looked like The Borg Queen (with a similar concluding plot twist from 'Star Trek'), while the good guys' machines looked like the gangly mechanical attackers from one of the 'Star Wars' movies so I kept losing track amidst the extensive blasting which blaster I was supposed to be rooting for.The romance, which is my favorite part of the series as a humanistic element, is at least still there, just way reduced to a tragic level I appreciated best when I was 12 years old, complete with bombastic musical theme. I almost did sigh at 'Trinity's' declaration: 'Six hours ago I told Merovingian I would do anything for you. You know what's changed in six hours? Absolutely nothing.' Not that there's anything wrong with appealing to pre-teens like that these days. The music finally picks up at the conclusion, being redolent of 'Carmina Burana,' probably to recall the orgy in Zion scene from 'The Matrix Reloaded.'All in all, it was better than 'Starship Troopers.'

Too bad the special effects won't get noticed precisely because they are so believable rather than fantastical. The camera work on the water is excellent.Tom Hanks is quite the Everyman as the whole audience wonders if they would be as inventive as he in surviving with an unusual set of resources.

The Village," Like A Slow, Long Extended 'Twilight Zone' Episode
","'The Village' is a beautiful looking, but slow, long extended 'Twilight Zone' episode or Ruth Rendell-type mystery with a twist.
Not only does the camera move slowly, but the characters speak very slowly, especially William Hurt as the Village Elder, to emphasize their non-modern context.  So Bryce Dallas Howard lights up the screen almost by default because she gets showier action and lines (though she looks so much like Judy Greer playing her screen sister that I was confused at first about Joaquin Phoenix's subtly quietly different reactions to each).
And there isn't much else that Phoenix gets to do, other than look like he could be the object of desire of two young women which he doesn't have to do much to be for any woman, even a blind one, while Adrien Brody just has to laugh a lot as the Village Idiot.  The very slow build-up does finally have an ironic pay off, but we've gotten pretty restless by then.",Null,1,2,10 August 2004

","I was right to make a point to catch 'Pitch Black' on a big screen before it goes to cable and video. What a taut action thriller! What scary yet modestly-priced special effects! What good use of the Aussie outback! Cool use of electronic music.Vin Diesel is as captivating here as he was in 'Boiler Room.'And there's a couple of my faves from obscure TV shows -- the actress who plays 'Aeryn Son' on 'Farscape' was basically playing the same role (and she's not even the only strong woman character) and one of the cops, Colin Hauser, from the late 'High Incident.'Very unpredictable and surprising with no racial, gender, cultural or sci fi stereotypes.

Cold Mountain," Gone With the Wind Redux
","'Cold Mountain' is a grand old-style, satisfyingly catch-you-up-in-the-sweep-of-emotions/resistance-is-futile Hollywood epic, whose primary difference from 'Gone With the Wind' is that the actresses get to flash some tasteful T & A and use a four-letter word more vulgar than 'damn' about manure.  Perforce it can only be a hurried 'scenes from' the engrossing novel which puts Penelope and Odysseus amidst the Civil War where author Charles Frazier added irony to Homer as Ada/Penelope first has to (metaphorically) learn to weave as she keeps suitors and other dangers at bay and Inman/Odysseus is not a hero but barely survives as a deserter to face parallel trials on the way home.  The book at least includes a map so readers can trace Inman's lengthy Odyssey, but the movie unfortunately opts out of that 1940's-style even as it follows other conventions of the genre, particularly as seen through John Seale's beautiful cinematography from the fog of war to the fog of snow. 
While producers Miramax are technically not a major studio, their casting is part of what puts this in the grand Hollywood tradition. 
Even under dirt and mussed hair, Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the mostly stunningly beautiful human beings on the planet --and it's a pretty safe bet that they'll be entered in MTV's 'Best Film Kiss of 2003'--yet they almost don't stand out amidst an attractive cameo cast with the likes of Natalie Portman, Cillian Murphy, Giovanni Ribisi, Charlie Hunnam, with Ray Winstone as the villain, etc.  It was almost startling to see Eileen Atkins's mountain woman as the first non-pretty or handsome character actor. Renée Zellweger gets to chew the scenery as an over-the-top Ma Kettle, but her comic relief is enjoyable. While the complex production design, from battles to farms to log cabins, creates whole environments, 'Ada''s wardrobes must be pretty huge to fit all those beautiful dresses; it was only in the last days of poverty of the war that she actually had to repeat wearing one.  A good deal of the credit for the irresistibility of the movie is the music, especially T. Bone Burnett's Americana and Jack White's Americana-sounding selections, and I would have preferred even more of those and a bit less of Gabriel Yared's score. Allison Krauss's singing is especially evocative in enveloping the audience in the mood and themes, in 'The Scarlet Tide' and closing with Sting's 'You Will Be My Ain True Love', which is a shoo-in for an Oscar nom. There was a credited dialect coach, but I found the Southern accents bland. And none of the quibbles really matter.",Null,17,33,3 January 2004
American Psycho," very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary on the '80's
","Seeing 'American Psycho' right after 'High Fidelity' is like going through a fun-house mirror, as it's a warped, caustic view of many of the same issues 'HF' deals with humorously and with humanity. The monologues on pop music are disarmingly similar, but here they are just foreplay for uncontrollable hate and blood lust as a way to try to poke through them for feeling, as if it's ripping through Robert Palmer's 'Addicted to Love' video for blood.I have no idea about what the original book is like, but this is a 'Bonfire of the Vanities' of the single '80's set. One weakness is that we don't actually see the interchangeable yuppies work so we don't see the testosterone rush at work that is so frightening in 'Boiler Room' and would have added more tension and maybe even explanation here, where all we hear is that 'Mergers & Acquisitions' is synonymous for the lead character to 'murders and executions.' They are all so interchangeable (shades of 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' taking over Jude Law's character) that I was really not sure of what is real or fantasy when others keep saying that he must be mistaken about murdering a co-worker when they met with him.The lead character, played beautifully narcissistically by Christian Bale, is equally murdering men and women here, so the misogyny charges filed against the book don't apply here, and he's equally unfeeling to both. But as he breaks down, the irony is that he's not unfeeling about his crimes--the rest of the people around him are.It's a very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary.(originally written 4/15/2000)",7,1,2,12 December 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Very Noisy Sequel Starring Lots of Crashes
","I went to see 'Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines' at the recommendation of my older son, who I had introduced to the 'T' series on video. But I bet I was the only one there for the continuing story, as I was the only who seemed to get the comments and jokes in reference to the past movies so I guess they hadn't seen the other 'T' movies. Arnold's lines were pretty much just replay references to the older movies. I'm not sure I got all the plot points in the quiet dialogs, such as they were, in the lulls between car crashes -- sent back to do what, when, by whom? And while the vehicle chases were now construction cranes and fire trucks, it was just metal upon noisy metal upon more noisy metal. It's becoming common in sci fi these days to have the best way for an alien enemy to infiltrate humans is in disguise as a gorgeous blonde, let alone an indestructible one.But what made the movie for me was the wonderful in context line in the midst of one counter-attack: Nick Stahl as the grown-up 'John Connor' looking in wonder at Claire Danes: 'You remind me of my mother.'(originally written 8/31/2003)",4,0,1,19 December 2005

","I was thinking that the target audience for 'I, Robot' was 12-year-old boys who have not read the original science fiction by Isaac Asimov that posited The 3 Laws or seen any science fiction movies, but surely even they have seen at least a 'Matrix' or a 'Terminator' movie where machines take over so that what are supposed to be climactic scenes here of robot revolution are just been-there-seen-that.Will Smith and some interesting dialog about robot-prejudice, that I'm willing to bet was inserted by the usually serious Academy Award-winning writer Akiva Goldsman, save the movie from seeming like a total pastiche of other movies. It is a bit much just how much music video director Alex Proyas uses the post-'Ali' Smith as pin-up fodder (maybe this is supposed to be the motivation for women ticket buyers?), let alone product endorser - he actually points out a pair of Converse sneakers several times to the camera, though the 'Wall Street Journal' claims that a promotional fee was not paid. It's also a continuing hypocrisy in the ratings system that Smith gets to utter many 'sh*t's in a PG-13 movie while Fahrenheit 9/11 got an 'R,' let alone the indie movies that have to carry 'NC-17.'Bridget Moynahan does herself no favor in appearing opposite a robot with a soul, as Alan Tudyk's 'Sonny' out acts her throughout the movie. While I suppose the target audience isn't looking at her acting abilities, would that the director had considered the minds of other potential fannies in the seats.

American Beauty," Biting Suburban Satire
","'American Beauty' is an astounding movie debut for writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes.They seem influenced by the Coen Brothers stable for their warped, humorous, satirical take on American Life. The cast is absolutely perfect. Kevin Spacey is as good as he was in 'Usual Suspects,' which is really saying something. Chris Cooper once again shows his protean side, compared to the good old boys he's been playing lately.I can't recall Annette Bening ever being so brittle before. Though she is playing the Ultimate Suburban Wife she does get a couple of sympathetic moments.The teens are completely believable and captivating, often with very little dialog, though I nearly gagged on the Lolita element, as I have strong feelings about that boundary.The cinematography is beautiful, moving seamlessly from suburban idyll to dream sequences to video watching (with lots of symbolism about watching vs. participating). The parents' music was chosen very well and is integral to the story line, though I don't think the kids' got to be represented audio-wise to contrast with the classic rock that symbolized living in the past.(originally written 9/26/1999)",10,1,3,20 December 2005
The Patriot," Mostly Violently Entertaining for History Buffs, But Has Some Big Problems
","I was a big fan of 'Swamp Fox' during the Mickey Mouse Club, so I enjoyed most of 'The Patriot. 'But the 25% I didn't, I really didn't, i.e. the happy darkies (even if they managed to find historically accurate ones on the Gullah Islands, making Mel Gibson a Carolina up-country farmer--an extremely, atypically prosperous one, instead of a slave-owning plantationist). Conflating the Brits with the S.S. is awful (read Schlink's The Reader for a discussion of the ramifications of the same S.S.'s tactics.)Heath Ledger was really cute, though I'm not sure he really came across as a passionate idealist (I read an article that he was nervous as hell working with Gibson as his idol and I think that showed).Why is Gibson always pairing up with much younger women? Joely Richardson as his wife's sister must have been barely older than his 'son' -- and what is that a baby she's carrying around at the end?It's always nice to see Chris Cooper; he's a rock.This is definitely for those of us who like historical fiction. It reminded me of 'Barry Lyndon' and the 'Sharpe' series, which are both more thoughtful, deep, and better done. Only towards the end are the dramatic possibilities of the non-repeating, takes time to re-load muskets used whereas that's glossed over for most of the movie, probably on the assumption that Americans are used to more rapid-fire violence, and this is as violent as 'Gladiator.'The mattes of backgrounds were used very effectively, particularly of the harbor and battle scenes.John Williams's bombastic music is awful. I kept wishing that Mark O'Connor had done the score and then blimey it turned out he did the violin solos, the only good parts of the score. (originally written 7/15/2000)",6,4,8,21 December 2005
Van Helsing," Good Looking But Tired Retread of Monster Legends
","'Van Helsing' has excellent production design, music, sound editing, and special effects that should rattle the pre-teens it is aimed at and would probably have given me nightmares at that age but these days it's just rated PG-13.Both Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman manage to do blue-screen acting within clunky costumes, but it's Richard Roxburgh's Count Dracula who really stands out as sexily sinister. One could certainly imagine his prolific fertility with his three model-pretty brides. Australia just keeps putting out these hunks who can do any accent.The sidekick is the silliest yet for such movies; even the ones in 'Lara Croft' are more interesting.What a shame that Stephen Sommers wrote and directed as I just kept thinking what Joss Whedon would have done with the material instead of this literal and visual recycling of the old Frankenstein and Wolfman movies, etc., that were tired by the time Abbott and Costello satirized them.What was that about Van Helsing having been at Masada? That must have been in the days when his name was Abraham, before this movie for no particular reason changed it to Gabriel. (originally written 5/28/2004)",4,1,3,19 December 2005
Being John Malkovich," Incomparably Inventive and Uniquely Funny
","'Being John Malkovich' is a laugh out loud, creative hoot.It is incomparably inventive.With Kaufman writing the script particularly with the titular actor in mind it's hard to think of what other actor's persona would fit in as well, as Malkovich's protean roles leaning toward the bad guys makes for an effective back-story that say another wouldn't work as well. It was like a Monty Python cartoon come to life -- completely unpredictable and creative in every scene and in every angle and detail. I think director Spike Jonze put in a bunch of references to music videos that also have an absurdist touch - such as the last scene looking like Nirvana's 'In Utero' cover?(originally written 11/14/1999)",10,2,5,28 October 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," 'Animal House' Grows Up
","'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is 'Animal House' 27 years later (if the frat boys were 13 then, which is how they acted). Like that film, regardless of the 'R' rating, the matinée I was at attracted babies up to boomers, with each segment laughing at different jokes (well, the babies mostly cried.) The kids hooted at every frequent use of four letter words, which were used quite naturally in conversations, and didn't get any of the funny musical references to the '70's.Director/co-writer Judd Apatow and co-writer/star Steve Carell well capture single guys exaggerated braggadocio to each other, with each having a different immaturity issue (while they all share a love of video games) and still oblivious about and inept with women. However, the trash talking takes an unnecessary racial turn with Asian and African-American co-workers for repetitive jokes that went on too long of other guys talking black that was already classically done in 'Airplane,' plus the constant gay joshing, that like in 'Four Brothers,' defensively borders on homophobia. Carell's character is most believable when he's not parroting these other guys but is genuinely himself. While it recalls HBO's 'Mind of the Married Man,' it is very funny when it braves original takes on dating and sex education, hair waxing and condom use. Some of the actors' cracking up looks like genuine reaction to the goings on. Paul Rudd's lovelorn depressive is particularly amusing.The film is bolstered by the strong performances by women, as these are real actresses and not just the usual bland beauties such comedies employ, with the women getting the last laugh on these guys. Catherine Keener's character has a real, amusingly complicated life (with a nice promotion for e-Bay) and past that informs the development of her relationship with the titular character. Elizabeth Banks, notably more bubbly than in 'Heights,' is charming. The film does go on a bit long, and while evidently some jokes were cut due to unsympathetic responses of test audiences, more could have been. The credits close with a nice thank you to Michael McDonald - 'You rock'-- as his DVD is a source of a running gag. A lot of pop culture references go by --actors, movies, TV shows--and I wasn't sure if they were product placement or had particular resonances.",6,3,7,23 August 2005
She's the Man," Surprisingly Funny Girl Power Celebration
","'She's The Man' is a surprisingly funny take on gender roles in high school sports. As even more loosely based on Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night' than the rock musical 'Your Own Thing', with just a bit more effort it could have been up to the level of the previous bard teen adaptation '10 Things I Hate About You' by the same co-writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith.The film's good spirits lift it above difficulties that it unnecessarily sets up. Amanda Bynes is plucky but not very physically convincing as an athlete, particularly compared to Keira Knightley in 'Bend It Like Beckham' or Blake Lively in 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants', even with stunt doubles on the field.She's also not helped by the odd casting decision to surround her with older hunky and beautiful actors and actresses in their mid-20's who would look old in a frat party movie, even if maybe she's supposed to be a freshman among seniors. The jock object of her hidden affection (Channing Tatum as 'Duke Orsini') only sounds good in a towel, and is so supposedly tongue-tied with girls, that I was convinced by her argument to competitor 'Olivia' on all the reasons not to date him so I couldn't figure out why she otherwise would want to. His one discussion about what he would really like from a relationship with a girl is very weak.The script goes out of its way to avoid sexual orientation issues for its below 12 target audience, who I assume are familiar, as I am not, with Bynes's TV work. There's an implicitly gay hairdresser who for some reason hangs out with teen age girls, unless we weren't told that he's a fellow student who works at a salon, and there's several spontaneously enthusiastic embraces between a guy and the disguised 'Viola' as 'Sebastian' that turn awkward, but there's not a single homophobic accusation or coming out by any one. If it weren't for the cell phones and Nike symbol on the girls' soccer team uniforms I wouldn't have even thought this Illyria Prep was in the U.S. today.While it's too bad that the girls don't take up any Title IX cudgels or consider more recruitment when their soccer team is canceled for lack of participation, the film seems to positively say that there's issues of expectations as to why the girls' soccer training isn't as tough, not lack of skills and motivation among the girls. So too bad 'Viola/Sebastian' stereotypically faints at the sight of a dissected frog in science class. While not near 'Transamerica' issues of course, Bynes's mannerisms are not too credible when she's being a boy (though the quick edits of her trying to learn to imitate boys and her quick switching at a carnival are fun), but she's at her best as a rebel at the ball. Unlike other girls' sports movies, there is an intriguing parallel story about débutante expectations that skirts the tomboy issues by showing that girls can knock down opponents on the field then get prettied up and get the guy too.Too bad many of the positive images of women are lost when scantily clad cheerleaders suddenly appear to shake at the soccer match, but maybe that was to balance the many guys in the shower scenes in case director Andy Fickman thought this could ever possibly be a date movie. (The few teen boys at my matinée showing were clearly there to mock the film.) They do try to PC up the side story of the geeky girl in glasses and braces, but she's played too much for stereotyped laughs before she too gets a guy when she becomes a bit of a swan.David Cross's principal was silly, but Shakespeare had clowns too.Though there's a running musical joke that the 'Viola/Sebastian's cell phone ring sounds embarrassingly girly pop, the music selections were surprisingly not pop. They miss an opportunity to make a point as well done with a similar mood or lyrics in 'Freaky Friday', but there's posters on the walls and selections by rockers All-American Rejects and O.A.R., as well as by Joan Jett and indie romantic crooner Ray LaMontagne. Nice touch that the twin brother is a rocker with sensitively written lyrics is how he captures 'Olivia's heart, which is not much more rationale than the original Will provided.All in all, the film was a surprisingly entertaining girl power celebration, with lots of laugh out loud opportunities. I will now laugh at tampons in a way I never thought to before.",7,3,7,22 March 2006
Spider-Man," Fun Blending of Fantasy With Some Reality
","'Spider-Man' is 'our local neighborhood super hero,' according to the TV theme song played at the very end of the movie credits, and for our family he is, as there were several scenes shot in Forest Hills.That nicely grounds the fantasy in reality, as does Tobey Maguire's terrific performance with his insecurities and growing self-awareness of his powers.The movie is a lot of fun, with some LOL jokes, though I tuned out the repetitive fight scenes. This isn't the first movie to stage derring-do on the 59th Street Bridge putting the Roosevelt Island Tram in danger (I think it was 'Escape from New York' that did that cool), but it's effective. But is the abandoned manse he tracks the villain into part of Goldwater Hospital? Poor Kirsten Dunst has very little to do, except be a damsel-in-distress, which is too bad. But that rainy kiss is a sure winner for the MTV Movie Awards.Most of the negative reviews have been of Willem Dafoe's villain, but I thought he was quite effective.For James Franco this is pretty much a prequel, setting him up to be the villain in 'Spider-Man 2.'Danny Elfman's music swept the action along.

Jarhead," Boys Go to Late 20th Century R Rated War
","'Jarhead' is a visually stunning celebration of making an R rated film about enlisted men, ground level troops from basic training through homecoming in a late 20th century war. And that's it.The first third is a repeat of every movie ever made about basic training, including 'Full Metal Jacket' and even having Jamie Foxx channel Louis Gossett Jr. from 'An Officer and A Gentleman.' Just that now we get to hear a lot of variations of the 'F' word in conversations and scatological marching chants. The squadron is even set up as the diversity of the new Army (there's an amusing interchange about unfamiliarity with author Anthony Swofford's Anglo-Saxon surname), as the inevitable kid from Compton now replacing the World War II stereotype of the boy from Brooklyn, with two Latinos, one dark, one light, with one a Cuba Libre proponent. That's just about all we learn about each of these guys, though at least we can tell them apart more than the guys in 'Black Hawk Down.' Peter Sarsgaard is mesmerizing but his character stays a bit of a mystery throughout. Are these any different than scenes from an Queda training camp would be? Just as generals fight the previous war (the lesson learned here was to have overwhelming force and popular support), these guys get hopped up on Viet Nam War movies, though the message of 'Apocalypse Now' seems lost on them and there's only one plaint for their own music (there's actually surprisingly little hip hop on the soundtrack though Thomas Newman's soundtrack and other selections are very effective). ). This section is tedious and loses the audience too soon.The second third is the build-up to Gulf War I as it slowly changed from Desert Shield into Desert Storm, and which we at home knew a lot more about through CNN than these troops out in the desert did (and there's no sign of other members of the coalition), as they only get propaganda briefings a la the truism that the first victim of war is the truth. This scabrous section is basically Boys Gone Wild with Boredom, that veers close to HBO's 'Oz' territory and you can practically smell the latrines and body odor. The R rating could have been pushed much further here, as the full extent of what isolated men are like together is covered clinically in the voice-over that is only useful in this section and is otherwise too annoying throughout. A beefed up Jake Gyllenhaal is explosive in representing the marines' disintegrating mental state. The military does seem to have learned some lessons from this readiness experience to keep troops in touch with home, as seen in the recently canceled FX series 'Over There.' The scenes of press interviews have lost a bit of punch since we've seen since embedded reporters. It is effective at showing how a brutal misogyny can develop in these situations (with a toss-off about fertility as a half-hearted balance) such that the women in their lives become The Enemy in the bitter 'Wall of Shame' of cheating wives and girlfriends. (There's a nasty vignette of a wife turning her husband's fondness for 'The Deer Hunter' back on him.) It's a small stretch to understand how in other cultures and at other places rape and pillaging could become a weapon of war as a release. (Homophobia is not dealt with.) War looks like a controlled outlet for testosterone.The third section is all about Roger Deakins' cinematography, from the blinding white out of the desert to the burning oil wells, to friendly fire and collateral damage. It is starkly beautiful.There are some political points here as gradually the sniper marines realize they are irrelevant in an air war, but we know that won't be the case in the Gulf War Part 2 that's now urban guerrilla battles. 'Three Kings' was much better at combining the grunts' and the wider cultural and political perspectives, though there's some token discussion about dissent. The film reinforces another truism that troops in battle fight for their buddies, not for ideology (presumably in Queda as well). The concluding coda is heavy-handed, including the closing narrative point: 'All wars are different. All wars are the same.' 'Best Years of Our Lives' made the same points and almost the same story lines.While Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert seem to get a kick out of strutting around as superior officers, I doubt the military can use this as a recruiting film, as there's brief points about inadequate equipment and risky issued drugs.",6,2,6,7 November 2005
Collateral," Cool Looking and Sounding Night Ride
","'Collateral' is a cool looking and sounding night odyssey.  Very similar in feel to director Michael Mann's 'Heat,' it is an extended chase scene between wary opponents, in this case two classes of adversaries. 
One is the involuntary opponent, Jamie Foxx, doing mild-mannered surprisingly well, as the Hitchcockian ordinary-man-rising-to-extraordinary cab driver; he uses his comic talents quite believably in one scene where he has to mimic Tom Cruise's Special Forces-turned-hit-man mode of talking.
The other is law enforcement as they belatedly figure out what's going on, and provide the exposition explanations for the viewer.  I wouldn't have recognized greased down Mark Ruffalo if I hadn't seen him doing a 'Tonight Show' promo spoiler for the film.  Cruise is very effective here as a coiled, well organized villain, where, as in 'Magnolia,' he can't just use his now boring grin and movie star hero stance and Mann is not intimidated by him in shot placement (even though Cruise has something like five assistants and personal specialists listed in the credits).  The mise en scene rules, with sharp editing by Jim Miller and Paul Rubell, especially in a climactic night club scene where I lost track of the body count.  A couple of more conventionally blazing action sequences follow (and I'm pretty sure the L.A. subway doesn't run so late at night). 
There are many amusing references to other movies quietly dropped in with a straight face as being part of the characters' make-up, such as from 'Taxi Driver,' 'Pulp Fiction,' and 'Speed,' and pop culture in general, such as references to Cruise's height and an island photo on the visor from an old TV commercial. The CD soundtrack only samples the complex musical selections (though it does include the Calexico song) and pounding mood-setting that could be by James Newton Howard but more likely by Howard Zachary Koretz or Antonio Pinto.  There was one disconnect when the soundtrack is clearly playing neo-soul by someone like Ellis Hooks or Van Hunt or Ricky Fante that's not on the CD, yet Foxx's driver is talking about 'the classics' coming out of his radio so I thought he meant Old School Soul but the conversation confusingly moved on to classical music. This movie is definitely better seen and heard on a big screen than it will be on DVD or television.",Null,0,1,10 August 2004
The Machinist," A Dark and Spooky Psychological Thriller
","'The Machinist' demonstrates that 'Session 9' wasn't the only creepy thriller that Brad Anderson could do. While M. Night Shyamalan and commercial fare like 'The Grudge' get the attention and the big bucks, Anderson is quietly mastering disturbing, psychologically scary shockers. While the previous movie took advantage of our imaginations leaping around a spooky environment, 'The Machinist' makes our discomfort palpably visual in Christian Bale's painful to look at body, as his character is ravaged by insomnia and loss of appetite; by the end of the movie it's shocking to see his normally handsome face. But all the focus on his astounding weight loss takes away from the other elements in the almost black and white film that make it a scare fest. The movie establishes 'The Twilight Zone' mood immediately with the soundtrack, which includes generous use of the theremin, as Hitchcock did in 'Psycho.' The production design is excellent at supporting the mood.The suspense builds and is sustained through to the satisfying conclusion as you genuinely get involved in Bale's efforts to solve the increasingly mysterious happenings around him. Even though you are pretty sure he could be hallucinating, you are intrigued to figure out the trigger. Despite looking like a caricature of a Holocaust victim, Bale creates a full character, from the jocular male camaraderie of the factory where he doesn't quite seem to fit in to responding one beat off to the warmth of the two women in his life, a waitress and a prostitute with the an open heart of gold (played, as usual by Jennifer Jason Leigh, but effectively languid).",Null,140,172,22 November 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A Delight for Fans of the Book
","'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is the most enjoyable and entertaining of the series so far.Director Alfonso Cuarón and adapter Steven Kloves just assume we've read the books and seen the other movies so focuses on new main plot points with little time spent on explanations and side stories. So while this not a good entry point for neophytes, it's a barrel of laughs and excitement for fans. The kid stars and co-stars are growing suitably along with the story line and I certainly hope they can continue with each movie, as their characters fit like gloves.The adults continue to be a stellar representation of British talent, though they ham it up a bit too much, with the addition of David Thewlis as the first nice guy defense of the dark arts teacher who surprisingly could have seemed a bit more tormented about his monthly problem, Emma Thompson playing the clairvoyant as just plain batty, Michael Gambon a bit too twinkly in replacing Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Timothy Spall literally as a rat.The very long, and visually delightful, closing credits show the extent of the special effects, but we do see them all on the screen. Well, not all the long list of accountants and the masseur.And they needed Cynthia Weil to come up with song lyrics that are taken straight from the witches of 'MacBeth'? As it was a few weeks until my family could get organized to see it, the print we saw was pale and had poor sound, which made the noisy and noting-the-obvious all-ages audience particularly distracting. Though at the end of the 141 minutes, the kid in back of me (and inside of me, too) protested to his parents: 'That wasn't long!' (originally written 7/6/2004)",10,0,4,19 December 2005
Tigerland," Colin Farrell is Mesmerizing!
","'Tigerland' is a Vietnam War movie the way that 'The Unforgiven' is a Western.It's more a Universal Soldier movie, as 'Fortunate Son' is not on the soundtrack, or virtually any other period music. It is comparable to the fine, underrated 'Full Metal Jacket' as it's more about basic training than Vietnam. It certainly won't be a recruiting film for Today's Army that is trying to use participatory Sigma Quality Management Circles to retain better educated soldiers.Colin Farrell is mesmerizing as the Rebel With A Cause--to clear the Army of misfits, sadists and undesirables, including himself. There's a neat, original scene when he gets a tough barking sergeant to reveal his first name.In general, young hard-bodies are feasts for the eyes, even if it's hard to tell crew-cutted objects apart.The cinematography looks effectively TV newsreelish, especially as it's really a memory play about our youth looming large and mythic over the rest of our lives.(originally written 10/7/2000)",8,4,8,12 December 2005
Batman Begins," A Dark and Serious Sounding and Looking Take on the Legend
","'Batman Begins' is a mostly effective, serious retelling of what is now a legend as a dark, post 9/11 rumination on fear, vengeance and justice. This Batman's approach could be a third way between the Jedi and the Sith as a catharsis for angst. While the opening scenes in the Mysterious Orient that probably appeal more to comic book readers at first seem exaggeratedly confusing, director/co-writer Christopher Nolan integrates them with pregnant flashbacks and superb production design, particularly through the recurring visual motif of bats. The attention to visual and aural detail is marvelous, including the triggering, Faust story opera that young Wayne attends (Arrigo Boito's 'Mefistofele') with additional references later on to the Rolling Stones' 'Sympathy for the Devil'. Visually, this Gotham integrates the grit and spookiness of different types of special effects from 'Sleepy Hollow,' '28 Days Later. . .,' and 'Escape from New York' to create a complete environment. The sardonic script even gives some thought to the future of cities, from the senior Wayne's philanthropic focus on building a mass transit system to 'Bruce' paralleling Abraham's debate with God as to whether Sodom and Gomorrah are worth saving, and evidently Gotham can put together a minyan. Christian Bale is a key factor in grounding the film in psychological realism, as he makes 'Bruce Wayne''s step-by-step, guilt-ridden choices build up believably. He is also charming as he creates the alter-ego of a carefree playboy. We only get too few glimpses of just how much he bulked up and worked out after 'The Machinist,' but his personal trainer deserves his line in the credits. Also keeping a foot in realism are the sword fights that eschew the popular tricks from Asian films for more refreshingly old-fashioned swashbuckling, though the final fight, with a twist on ideological enemies I hadn't anticipated, went on a bit too long even if the points it makes are intellectual.The casting choices are both an added strength and distracting weakness, particularly the selections of mostly actors from the British Isles. Third time's the charm for Liam Neeson as a sword-wielding mentor compared to his not quite credible takes on that role in 'Phantom Menace' and 'Kingdom of Heaven,' maybe because here his character ends up more complex. Michael Caine is simply great as a play on the British military officer's assistant definition of batman with an added, warm, father figure element. Cillian Murphy is devious without camping up his evil psychiatrist. When he lets loose with one cackle it's a charmer and he uses those beautiful baby blues to creepy effect.But that wonderful actor Tom Wilkinson is not only miscast as a gangster, it's a bit pathetic that the fictional Gotham's underground is run by cliché imitation 'The Sopranos,' regardless of fealty to the old comics. Gary Oldham seemed wasted as a ground-down by corruption cop. As to the Americans, Morgan Freeman gets to twinkle a bit more ironically as a mentor than in 'Unleashed.' Katie Holmes has no chemistry with Bale but at least she seems earnest. From other parts of the world, Ken Watanabe and Rutger Hauer are underused. I did get lost on some plot points about the key weapon, but it's cool looking without understanding its parameters and it's enough that it has to do with light and dark. The music is mediocre.",7,3,5,1 July 2005
Meet the Fockers," Being Fockerized Becomes A Jewish Hug
","I didn't see the precursor to 'Meet the Fockers,' but so much of it has entered general popular culture that I could get all the references, plus the young noisy audience I saw it with helpfully shouted out all the links.This audience loved the easy-going slapstick and physical humor the best. The sight gags with the nephew baby are at the 'Look Who's Talking' level.While much of the movie is just plain silly and predictable, the old pro's Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand and Robert DeNiro are having so much fun that they are completely irresistible.Streisand in particular avoids the usual stereotypes of a Jewish mother by creating a character who is a bit kooky, as a sex therapist for senior citizens, but, as her husband admiringly says, 'a very strong woman.' I particularly liked how Hoffman, playing real mensch, defends their relationship with their son to the in-laws, that the worst they can be accused of is loving him. The script, mostly by the same writers as the original, doesn't let Blythe Danner portray any of the brittle manipulativeness she masterfully displays in the Showtime series 'Huff.' This may be the most benign image of secular Jews since Barry Levinson's Baltimore nostalgia-fest with Jews here being portrayed as earthy, honest and emotional. Streisand throws in less Yiddish than Michael Meyers used in imitating his mother-in-law on 'Saturday Night Live.' The closing wedding tries for compromise in that they are married under a huppah canopy, with a yarmulke-wearing gag 'interfaith minister' (Owen Wilson in a cameo recall from the first movie) who clumsily does a kiddush blessing on the wine for no particular reason, instead of the traditional breaking of the glass. The daughter takes her stand by declaring herself a Focker and his parents triumphantly assert that her family has been Fockerized  a new kind of assimilation strategy, though the audience mostly responded to the pun.What was odd was that the writers or the director were so afraid that their portrayal of the Jewish parents might seem offensive that they added on a coda over the credits where Ben Stiller, more in his real persona than as 'Gaylord Focker,' redundantly and explicitly defends his family for hugging, loving and being in touch with their emotions. The audience stayed through this tirade expecting a jokey punchline and were confused that there wasn't really any.While Randy Newman did the music, there's only two originals of his breezy songs, over the opening and closing credits, and they are not particularly outstanding. It is odd that several classic rock songs are thrown in.",4,1,3,31 December 2004
Before Sunset," Hello Young Lovers - Part Deux
","I was surprised how many in the audience of 'Before Sunset' had not seen the previous 'Before Sunrise' as I didn't think it was possible to follow it, let alone appreciate the dialogue, stand-alone.  This 'Part Deux,' as it takes place in instantly recognizable Paris, contains less explanatory flashback material than the consequently essential trailer did, as the premise for the movie is a specific 'what if?' portend of future potential regret that Ethan Hawke's Jesse used to seduce Julie Delpy's Celine for a night around Vienna almost ten years ago.  How can someone who hasn't seen the first film judge the tricks memory may be playing on each character if you don't know what you remember really happened?  It is a wonderful premise and creative writing collaboration among director Richard Linklater and the stars to have the characters revisited in the real time of being older in a real time conversation that is filmed a la Eric Rohmer, like his 'Les Rendez-vous de Paris.' The movie carries an additional subtext that shadows the characters and adds to the complexity.  Back in 1995, Hawke was at his most earnestly, shaggily adorable and Delpy was an up-and-coming starlet.  But now we've seen Hawke rise to an Oscar nomination, as well as a novelist like Jesse, while becoming tabloid fodder for the break-up of his family with Uma Thurman, and he bears a gaunt, haunted, shorn look.  Delpy has during this time only surfaced occasionally to American audiences, so that her strong, luminous character here is particularly captivating and believable as a professional activist as well as a songwriter (quite sweet on the soundtrack and probably on her own CD, too) and you simply can't take your eyes off her.  She nicely counters the image of her delicate beauty with frank exchanges and well-kicked profanity. Elements of the premise have been done to exaggerated comic effect in the Western satire 'From Noon Till Three' Neil Simon's 'Same Time Next Year' and 'The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares),' but this feels natural.
Where the earlier movie had the charm of a late night, dorm room bull session resonant of  the potentials of youth, this one is an amusing probing of protective defenses to honestly reveal thwarted, older and trying to be wiser expectations as they circle each other to consider once again grabbing what could be the brass ring amidst the complicated real lives they have built. This ending is as deliciously open-ended as the first and I look forward to revisiting Jesse and Celine ten years hence.",Null,3,4,21 July 2004
Saving Private Ryan," A 1940's War Movie Without the Hays Code Restrictions
","We saw 'Saving Private Ryan' as a family. My husband, who watches the War Channels constantly to the extent that I walk by teasing him that I'll let him know the end - 'The Germans lose!', thought it was a fresh spin on traditional war movies by showing the doubts of the soldiers. I thought it was just a color WWII movie as young 'uns refuse to see black and white movies these days. I could match that this actor was playing the William Bendix role, this one John Garfield's, this one Robert Ryan's, this one Montgomery Clift, etc.Those movies were restricted by the Hays Code and the need to spur war time spirit that they couldn't show doubts, though I remember some revisionist movies made after about the impact on Berlin, another with Robert Taylor vs. the Japanese on some island. Or even Bridge on the River Kwai. So they weren't all jingoistic.I walked out of 'Ryan' saying 'Gee, war is hell.' Edward Burns was excellent.The cinematography was terrific and compelling.

The Chorus," Sentimental Treacle for the Eye and the Ear
","'The Chorus (Les Choristes)' demonstrates that France is just as able to put out sentimental treacle as Hollywood, for those who thought the Gallic sensibility was inherently cynical, philosophical and intellectual or even romantic.There is a long cinematic history of similar movies. The brutal reform school lorded over by sadists genre of the British and Irish movies, such as 'If' and 'Borstal Boy,' usually are from the point of view of the rebellious working class inmates, while the American version usually focuses on the inspirational teacher, not necessarily of the downtrodden unless race is also a factor, such as in 'Dangerous Minds.' There's 'To Sir With Love' which brings in all these elements. And there have been several that use music as the key, from 'Mr. Holland's Opus' to 'School of Rock' and 'Music of the Heart,' some even based on true stories.The marginal originality here is that the focus is on a boys' chorus performing classical music, but I always find those angelic pre-puberty voices more creepily pure than appealing, as they are just so fleeting until their voices change. It is annoying how quickly the sympathetic chorus master molds the kids into perform-ability - there aren't even any rough rehearsals after the amusing scene where the kids reveal the little exposure they've had to any sort of songs.We're even robbed of the impact of the chorus on a key boy because the film is one long flashback. We only get a frisson of an implication of what else may have gone on in such schools as revealed in 'Bad Education (La Mala educación).' This film is pretty to look at and listen to and saccharinely predictable.",4,7,22,16 February 2005
The Pianist," A Very Polish Jewish Holocaust Story
","My husband demurred going to see 'The Pianist 'as he 'didn't want to see another Holocaust movie.' Besides that every survivor's story is unique, besides the beautiful cinematography where color looks like browning black-and-white photos, and the tremendous performance and physical transformations by New Yorker Adrien Brody (and it's nice to finally see a real Jewish nose on a Holocaust movie star), Roman Polanski does have a different perspective to give. This is the first time I can recall a specifically Polish Jewish viewpoint, even though other films have also dealt with the Warsaw Ghetto's creation, uprising, and destruction. While Wladyslaw Szpilman's personal story is no way identical to Polanski's similarly accidental personal survival of the Holocaust, the film is suffused with what are clearly Polanski's vivid memories, particularly of pre-war Warsaw, the round-ups, and then the post-war city-wide devastation. The Szpilman family's urbane integration into secular Polish society is made clear at the outset; Wladyslaw is flirting with a non-Jewish colleague and the Nazi restrictions mostly interfere with his dating routine at first. Strong family ties, even among adult children, are beautifully portrayed.
But what is most startling throughout is the sympathetic view of Poles, unlike any similar movie. We hear frequently from Poles who are saddened by the restrictions, only see one glimpse of a Polish anti-Semite, and we frequently see Polish resistance fighters and their sympathizers, though they come out of the woodwork mostly due to Szpilman's fame. The infamous, compromised Jewish policemen in the Ghetto are given harsher treatment by the filmmaker. My ignorance of classical music made me miss a key point in one scene as I didn't know what piece he was playing and wanted to know if he was playing a Polish or German composer, though I inferred from the closing credits that it was probably German. But that was evidently a fictive scene. As I saw the film in Kew Gardens, Queens, settlement of many survivors, an elderly man on the line said, in a strong accent, when he was 15 in Warsaw after the war he'd met Szpilman, who recounted his story to him, and that the German who saved him did so for him as a human being, not a pianist.  Would that have been more moving?",Null,1,3,2 February 2003
Seabiscuit," A Pretty Historical Reenactment
","'Seabiscuit' is a beautiful looking movie, but ultimately feels like a tableau reenactment.  The only element not static is the frequent, of course, horse races, which I zoned out of with repetition and slo mo's. 
With David McCullough's narration and integration of black & white photos of the period, it feels like an extended version of the hour-long 'American Experience' episode on PBS, which also included excellent interviews with book author Laura Hillenbrand, whose book I have not yet read. 
Every emotion is visually telegraphed then repeated with writer/director Gary Ross's script.  For example, at the moment before jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is introduced to the horse, we see trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) look at Seabiscuit reared up fighting against stable boys and see him comparing that to Red fighting off attacks from fellow jockeys.  Then again.  And again -- hey, we got it, they share something, thanks.  And, oh yeah, they need each other. The opening panorama as we are quickly introduced to the background of each character, and the final section when each rises to deal with calamity are the most moving.  While it looks like all the period recreation is authentic, the sets and people seem to be playing more dress-up than fully realized people, though Maguire puts some liveliness into his portrayal.  Real life jockey Gary Stevens was quite good, though the guy behind me, who offered commentary throughout the film, kept complaining that there was no way the jockeys could be having those extended conversations during the races. Yes, you'll tear up, as every melodramatic element in this story is hammered home, supported by Randy Newman's uncharacteristically maudlin and incessant score.",Null,0,0,14 September 2003
28 Days Later...," Apocalypse Now Comes to London
","'28 Days Later. . .' is a gritty, contemporary re-interpretation of the nexus of the genres of intellectual-post-apocalypse humans-messing-with-nature sci fi (like 'Omega Man' and 'On the Beach') and bloody zombie horror (including pod people), as well as virus threats (like 'Andromeda Strain') that are no longer idle speculation.'Vanilla Sky' tried to capture a similar mise en scene with the opening dream scene in a deserted Times Square, but that was about the star from those opening shots.  Director Danny Boyle uses skinny accidental hero Cillian Murphy amidst scans of the freakishly deserted London (there's a thanks in the credits to all the officers who held back the city traffic), while John Murphy's music plays up the fear, confusion, and the unknown.
Alex Garland's script is particularly insightful about human reactions, feelings, and relationships amidst disaster, especially how tropic we are towards hope and connection, such that the grim line 'Women are about the future' put a chill down my spine. The actions and appearances of the trustworthy and the untrustworthy can seem identical visually without context, making judgments instantaneously necessary and risky (for us and the characters)--is that a passionate kiss or an attacking bite?
We really care about the individuals unpredictably meeting their fates, as we're given just enough background to make them believable and real, as it comes full circle on the issue of being humane.  Though there's no big-name stars, I recognized the excellent actors from Brit TV mini-series (and did have a little problem with the accents and slang now and then).
The ending, that feels like its in color in contrast to rest that seems to be more in shades of black-and-white and bloody red, does seem a bit tacked on, though a key clue is introduced just before the climax.
The digital video was occasionally blurry in the print I saw; I don't know if that was intentional or if the DVD will look better, but it's a very visually communicative film.",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
City of God," A whirlwind window to a violent world of gun-toting kids
","'City of God (Cidade de Deus)' may be the most violent movie I've ever seen.
And just when I thought I was inured to the shooting and the murders, such that I couldn't even keep track of them anymore or who was getting killed by whom for what reason or carelessness, it topped itself and got more violent and made me start caring again.It's not just the socially conscious Brazilian true story line of abject poverty creating an army of desperate children with guns that makes this so captivating and meaningful beyond the endless bloodshed.
Directors Kátia Lund and Fernando Meirelles have a relentless, in-your-face camera style that circles around somewhat similarly to 'Amos Perros.' The story, based on a novel based on true facts, if I could figure out the non-translated credits correctly, whips around in time to show us how each mini-gangster in the huge, differentiated ensemble of extraordinary amateur actors got to be the way he is. The voice-over narrator, and what happens to him as a budding photo-journalist, is a bit precious and is virtually the only bordering on cliche element, but he is a convenient window into a world of children who literally cannot separate fantasy from reality, (who have no access to violent TV, movies, or video games as a scapegoat) and have no impulse control whatsoever. The pulsating samba, funk, and Brazilian R & B music helps push the pace even faster; the action mostly takes place in the '60's and '70's so there's no hip hop though it's like illustrations of gangsta rap's most extreme tendencies. Props to the distributor for black outlining the white subtitles, as much of the visuals are a bleached-out landscape of hopelessness.",Null,1,2,16 March 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Magical, Beautiful Looking Love Story
","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)' is breathtakingly beautiful, the scenery, the cinematography, the martial arts choreography. But what a surprise that Ang Lee as the director of 'Sense and Sensibility' incorporates that into the movie too! While my younger son just wanted to know upon my return from the theater if the martial arts were like 'Matrix,' my husband sneered that it was too balletic (not a compliment from him), and I think what he really meant is that this is a chick flick. I totally didn't anticipate that this would be a sophisticated love story, let alone about two couples, and the various permutations of their relationships with each other, their teachers and their families. So this is really Jane Austen done as a mythic Chinese warrior movie.Michelle Yeoh is absolutely, maturely, captivating, especially in her sword fights with her protégé.'Over the hills and through the woods' or 'up on the roof' or 'wade in the water' never had quite so literal yet so magical meanings as shown here.

Hellboy," Cute Laughs Amidst the Special Effects
","'Hellboy' is a cute entertainment with expensive special effects, including elaborate underground bunkers on several continents, as befits the attention of a writer/director, Guillermo del Toro, who started his career in the make-up/effects departments.  Though stuck in a complicated Nazi-creation myth out of  'Indiana Jones,' the funny and snappy dialogue seems to take a lot of its attitude from the Joss Whedon universe of 'Buffy the Vampire Killer' and particularly from 'Angel, ' but lacks the depth and poignancy of bothThe romance ironically recalls 'Beauty and the Beast,' as the titular tormented hero of both is played by Ron Perlman.  Selma Blair, usually the goody goody, is surprisingly effective as a Goth-like freak who seems to be guesting from the 'X Men' series.  In a twist, the ingenue here is a guy, Rupert Evans, who the empathic freak, speaking in David Hyde Pierce's voice, identifies as truly 'pure of heart.' 
While I liked the conceit that each time the monster is killed it replicates from the ashes, it looks recycled from 'The Matrix Revolutions,' but down in the subway instead of outer space.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Rousing Romantic Adventure
","'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' uses the best of contemporary and traditional movie magic for a rousing, romantic adventure tale of good vs. evil, loyalty and love. From touches of Ray Harryhausen's 'Jason and the Argonauts' that were among my favorite movie movements as a child as the Ents and a couple of the monsters are charmingly hokey, to the seamlessly multiplying armored, costumed, hairy, made-up extras to the actor/rotoscoped combined astonishment of the twisted Gollum/Smeagle, it's all at the service of the story.Peter Jackson and company are wonderful at both closely hewing to the story yet skillfully cutting judiciously and adding clarifications that are in the spirit of the original, including using the appendix explanation of Aragorn's love affair with Arwen (incorrectly described as 'doomed' by one critic -- well, if an eventual mortal life of 50 years together and four kids is 'doomed' then many of us are doomed!)The mutual attraction with Eowyn is fit nicely into the 'to be continued' cliffhanger as I think the double X chromosome viewers are left as eagerly awaiting the conclusion of what happens to Arwen and Aragorn as what happens to the Ring.David Wenham makes us almost forget Sean Bean as his late brother, and I just figured out that's Hugo Weaving with quite a hair weave as Arwen's disapproving dad. And of course excitingly heroic Viggo is absolutely hunky (and I've thought so since at least 'Walk on the Moon'). I'll take this thrilling Battle of Helm's Deep over Saving Private Ryan for re-watching (with the second release of the DVD for the deleted scenes). No wonder there's now tours of the places in New Zealand the movie was shot because the scenery is breathtakingly beautiful, even if some of it is mattes.That's Sheila Chandra vocalizing in the effective music.

The Incredibles," A Rollicking Movie for Adults Too
","'The Incredibles' is a rollicking movie that adults can enjoy without cover of children. The illustration of the basic set up of super heroes driven into suburban hiding is very clever, though it does borrow a bit from similar issues explored both for humor and seriousness in the TV series about young Superman/Clark Kent 'Smallville.' While it does drag from time to time, particularly as the battle with the villain becomes a tad conventional for the genre, it's a lot of fun. The references to other movies, especially to James Bond villains and 'Star Wars,' are fun to pick out, and I'm sure I missed other references to comic books and their movie permutations. I haven't seen any of the 'Spykids' films, but the climax seemed similar to those. The voice-overs are terrific, particularly Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson as the parent superheroes and Jason Lee as their nemesis. The dueling for the last word in the credits between Disney and Pixar is amusing, given their contractual negotiations. How nice not to have any schmaltzy songs inflicted upon us in an animated feature!The preceding Pixar short about a shorn lamb shown with the movie was corny and unoriginal, both in story and execution.",Null,0,1,3 December 2004
School of Rock," Very Funny Tribute to the Love of Music
","'School of Rock' is practically a spin-off for Jack Black of his force-of-musical-nature character from 'High Fidelity.'Written for him by his friend (and ironically nerdy co-star here) Mike White, it is hysterically funny and has an excellent soundtrack with very apt classic metal selections (ah, it's been a long time since I heard the command 'Let's get the Led out!') and original, witty tunes (especially over the closing credits as it makes fun of people who stay to watch the credits- 'Hey, get out! They need to clean the theater!').The character's Peter Pan immersion in '70's culture is recreated down to his sheets -- the same ones I had, but even the rags cut I cut from them fell apart long ago. But it also has an intelligent maturity angle, as Black's character grows into his school teacher role to demonstrate a surprising sense of responsibility for his charges, including respect for legitimate music education, both hands-on and appreciation (the rock history lesson charts are excellent).Joan Cusack again shows what a wonderful comedienne she is, as she was in the recent Muppet TV movie, so that even as something of the villain of the piece she's still quite human, and the movie doesn't even swerve into a silly romance (though it will probably show up in the 'deleted scenes' section of the DVD).The only weak touch is the 'Queer Eye for a Straight Guy' reference that's over done with one of the kids.For some reason, though, parents brought very young children as if it's 'Finding Nemo,' including babes in arms and toddlers, who ran around the theater from boredom as they didn't get any of the jokes.

Hero," A Beautiful Tale of How A Legend is Born
","'Hero' is a visual delight, not the chop socky film it is being promoted as; this is much more a date movie than a guy's action flick. The comparisons to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' are inevitable, both for the relationships and the soaring around fighting. But 'Hero' doesn't even try to be as realistic when they jump to challenge gravity, because this is a tale of story-telling, like 'Big Fish.' It's about how legends are created, as the myth is created right before our eyes, until even the teller begins to believe what he's relating. Actions, let alone long, smoldering glances, mean very different things in every re-telling of the story (with each re-telling indicated in a different brilliant color and ever more breathtaking locale). The cinematographer is the Australian Christopher Doyle who also did the equally gorgeous but very opposite in scale Thai film 'Last Life in the Universe (Ruang rak noi nid mahasan)' that shares shifts in its storytelling with absolutely delightful and enthralling magic realism twists. The beauty is even more luscious than a fabulously breathtaking film that was also nommed for foreign language Oscar, the Korean 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom)' that was also fable like, but with no martial arts and small scale. The ads mostly emphasize Jet Li as the star but the movie is taken over by the other absolutely magnetic and romantic male lead Tony Leung Chiu Wai and the two women (the older Maggie Cheung and the younger Ziyi Zhang, both fabulously beautiful). Sure there's a political angle of favoring uniting warring Chinese states into one empire, but one could say the same about movies about Napoleon or probably most of the samurai movies, let alone 'The Last Samurai.' Heck, wasn't Britain trying to rule the world in 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' among other imperialistic period flicks? Media reviews have noted that the subtitles are quite different in the current release compared to the import DVD releases. I would think the music is too as now Itzhak Perlman does the fiddling -- and be sure to stay through the end of the credits to hear the full effect of the thrillingly percussive music.",Null,0,0,6 September 2004
No Man's Land," Very Funny and Very Tense and Frank Look at Post-Cold War Conflicts
","'No Man's Land' may be the first great post-Cold War anti-war film, where the root of war is shown as out and out irrational hatred, leaving civilized folks plotzing in the middle. The first fiction film by a theater director- turned soldier- turned documentarian, the complicated Yugoslav situation feels completely authentic. The multi-national cast of craggy characters is mostly full-blooded individuals, with their varying languages and communication attempts an ongoing joke ('You speak English of course?' the Frenchman continually asks sadly.)This movie grimly brings to life the joke about how an EU conference can be good or bad -- good, if the food is catered by the French, organized by the Germans, etc. etc. or bad if the Brits do the food, the Italians organize it, etc. etc. There are strays into stereotypes -- the ineffectual public school British general representing the UN trailed by his leggy assistant and the Brit woman news reporter is a replay of Nora Dunn's role in 'Three Kings' (though I liked her subtle flirting with the just-trying-to-do-the-right-thing French officer). The Serbian is the not the usual war criminal thug, which would have been easier, and the Serbians' aggressive role in the conflict is barely implied rather than blamed. Amazingly, the movie is both very funny (like 'M.A.S.H') and very tense with no easy ending or answers as no one wins. War is hell, even against bad guys. And for individual soldier pawns, futile. As I heard Norman Thomas say at the first anti-war rally I went to in 1965: 'These pawns bleed.' This also reminded me of one of my favorite 'Star Trek: The Original Series' episodes, with Frank Gorshin. Ah, plus c'est change. . .

Moulin Rouge!," OVer Opulent, Frantic Screen-Filler
","'Moulin Rouge' proves the Mullahs of Iran right -- Hollywood is The Great Satan, spreading its decadent ways around the world, infecting British actors to an Australian director and lead actress, and spending money opulently beyond most countries' GDP.I am second to none in my appreciation of Busby Berkeley musicals, but I never thought them lackluster, or modest and understated. Evidently, Baz Luhrmann does, as his charming opening mis en scene builds up from old black and white movie musicals. His script has the bad guy (the most ineffectual British villain on screen in years) shriek to the Bohemians 'I reject your dogma!' and Baz most certainly, most emphatically rejects the Dogma 95 filmmakers of social realism. Baz finds even Ken Russell and Terry Gilliam too tame, though I think at least Russell has also done opera directing as Baz has. The eye-popping MTV Movie Awards production of 'Lady Marmalade' was more restrained (and in fact more entertaining and more musical) than how the song is used in the movie. The camera and the editing just never stop; every millimeter of film stock is full and moves.Ewan MacGregor comes out the best; in a total opposite of his 'Trainspotting' druggie, here his wide-eyed innocent is sweet even when singing medleys of romantic clichés. (Too bad effective cynical songs about love weren't countered -- I waited in vain for 'What's Love Got to Do With It.')Poor Nicole Kidman is simply miscast. Much as Marilyn Monroe imitated Carol Channing's performance in 'How To Marry a Millionaire,' Nicole must imitate not one, not two, but at least three Madonna videos (from 'Material Girl' through to the pseudo-Indian influenced 'Ray of Light'). Did Madonna turn down the role as she was busy with Baby #2 and marriage? Did Baz not offer it to her or did the movie moguls think she couldn't fill the seats? The role needs very little acting so would have fit the Courtesan to the World quite well. (I found it amusing that the term courtesan is used every five minutes when the movie 'Dangerous Beauty' was re-titled from 'The Courtesan' because the producers were convinced audiences wouldn't know what the word meant.) Poor John Leguizamo is as irritating as Jar Jar Binks as a clownish Toulouse Latrec with a lisp; the poor guy has to play a dancing magical sitar. Like 'Shrek' and 'A Knight's Tale,' this is a movie musical with no original music, but highly original use of covers, if most are in pieces and medleys. I particularly liked the version of 'Roxanne' as if it were done by Tom Waits in a brothel, while the producers' pitch to the investor paled next to 'The Producers.' I'm quite sure that the audience was frequently laughing at the film, not with it.Note to movie musical producers -- watch the Tonys and see that there are plenty of talented people around who really do know how to sing and dance.(originally written 6/15/2001)",4,5,9,19 December 2005
Wimbledon," An Enjoyable Sports Romance
","'Wimbledon' is a creditable addition to the sports romance genre. While not dethroning the all-time champ 'Bull Durham' or even 'Tin Cup' because it's not particularly sexy, it plays well with such films as 'Wind' and 'Cutting Edge.'Paul Bettany is simply charming as an almost over-the-hill tennis player capable of getting through just one more tournament. But he has more chemistry with his German practice partner guy than with Kirsten Dunst as an up-and-coming American dynamo, though there is more tennis and droll tennis commentary about underdogs than romance. At least their age and cultural differences are dealt with as part of the plot and character motivations. (I got a kick out of her tending to get into the wrong side of the car.) James McAvoy gets to once again enthusiastically represent the randy younger generation, with at least his third participation this year on film in tabloid journalism.

Million Dollar Baby," A Spare and Gripping Character Study
","'Million Dollar Baby' is a spare, minimalist and gripping character study. Even the elements that now and then seem a bit extraneous, particularly about religious faith, turn out in the last few minutes to be vital. Director/star/scorer Clint Eastwood confidently pares the film and his performance down to its simplest elements. Tom Stern's cinematography is even more breathtaking than their collaboration on 'Mystic River,' especially in its use of darkness, and should have been recognized for an Oscar nomination. Paul Haggis's script recalls his ahead-of-its-time TV series 'E.Z. Streets,' where the dialog is more for character development and revelations than for plot. Particularly wonderful are the interchanges between Eastwood and Morgan Freeman that are lovely evocations of long-time male camaraderie. A key element of the film is its exploration of paternal aspects of masculinity we rarely see on film without a sexual context - friendship, mentoring and responsibility. The film, however, is almost too bare in its treatment of Hilary Swank's character, with none of the personal context that 'Girl Fight' stressed, particularly in the lack of any romantic hints at all -- is it to avoid any issues about the tomboy's sexuality? But this keeps the spotlight on the central, quasi father-daughter relationship with its emotionally draining conclusion that packs a tremendous wallop. One of the few jarring notes is the stereotyped portrayal of her grasping hillbilly relatives, including an inconsistency or two about them. Freeman's continuing narration simply got on my nerves, even if it is rationalized in the last frame, especially when it re-emphasized something we were seeing visually. I felt it was recalling his essential commentary in 'The Shawshank Redemption,' which is explicitly referenced in an amusing epithet. The glaring product placement for Everlast and the gratuitous reference to a Warner Brothers product were unnecessary and cheapened a moving story.",Null,4,7,29 January 2005
Garden State," Glory Days in NJ Can Still Come in the Future
","'Garden State' is a wonderful debut for writer/director Zach Braff, visually and verbally.  The camera's eye, in placement and Lawrence Sher's cinematography, beautifully support the sharp and truthful (and funny) dialogue.  And, no, as lead actor Braff's not just playing his 'Scrubs' role.
The directing and the acting, particularly backed by the expressive production design palette, well support the cross-country odyssey Braff's 'Andrew Largeman' undergoes as he eschews his father's prescription emotion-controllers for first recreational enhancers and finally for the pain and potential happiness of human relationships.  Every character has lies that are gradually and with clear eyes revealed, as each has to face up to who they have become, including Peter Sarsgaard's not so sympathetic stoner grave digger.  Natalie Portman is a delight in what may be her best role so far.  She is simply irresistible and the camera falls in love with her liveliness, from her eyebrows to her akimbo limbs, as she breathes life into 'Large.' 
While Braff resisted using Johnny Cash's cover of Loudon Wainwright's original of 'The Man Who Couldn't Cry' in a simply beautiful scene with a Dixie cup to capture a significant moment in 'Large''s life, the excellent song selection is as critical to the film as Scorcese's or Tarantino's.  The released soundtrack is annoyingly incomplete, lacking Alexei Murdoch's 'Orange Sky' and a closing song, among others.  The romantic use of The Shins' songs should certainly help sales of their CDs (the cuts on the soundtrack are both from their older 'Oh, Inverted World' CD).
The New Jersey settings are evocatively selected, with each house succinctly establishing the character's family setting.  The male camaraderie of ironically 'Glory Days' high school chums is also well-captured. 
But this is at least the fourth movie/TV show I've seen this year with a mother somewhat inexplicably bedding a gangly youth their son's age, such that either some male writers have watched 'Summer of '42' or even 'Harold and Maude' too often, seen too much about Mary Kay Letourneau or there's some other kind of anger out there.",Null,0,1,7 August 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Powerful and Pointed Docudrama
","'Good Night, and Good Luck' is a powerful docudrama that is a parallel to 'All the President's Men' in vividly demonstrating the importance of the fourth estate. Like 'The Crucible' used an earlier period to contemporaneously criticize the 1950's, co-writer/director George Clooney uses the 1950's to criticize politics and journalism today. The irony is emphasized through the structure of the film. With less opening background crawl than 'Star Wars,' the film opens at a dinner in 1958 honoring Edward R. Murrow where broadcasters are congratulating themselves for his role and he delivers a portentous challenge to television news, that we of course know has rarely been fulfilled.Then flashing back to 1953 by utilizing lengthy excerpts of kinescopes of Joseph McCarthy, 'the junior senator from Michigan' as he's frequently called, including a marvelous throw-down of Shakespeare quotations, and hearings he held, as well as recreations of Murrow's serious and celebrity interview broadcasts, the editing and spacing adds commentary. In a riveting performance, David Strathairn doesn't just copy Murrow in look and sound but adds subtleties like a raised eyebrow and hand motion that add volumes of meaning.The film makes clear that journalists are relevant to their reporting and that the times forced them to be, as everyone has secrets and standing to protect that can get compromised or can compromise a story -- from a new mortgage, to school tuition, to an ex-wife, to actual memberships -- as Strathairn's Murrow intones 'The fear is in this room.' While the film only glancingly notes that the Communist hunt hysteria had already been going on for at least six years before Murrow's pieces, including the coverage in newspapers that are the team's sources of information, it does establish right away that he had already personally signed a loyalty oath, to indicate that he had tolerated quite a bit before deciding enough was enough.The hypocritical context of primitive 1950's television is established particularly well. In addition to the casually sexist language, we see all the participants chain smoking away, we see a Kent cigarettes commercial, reminding us how the government and corporations were lying to us about the affects of cigarette smoking (which would kill Murrow a decade later through lung cancer). It is followed immediately by an interview with Liberace that is such a cover-up of his homosexuality that even though Murrow has agreed to conduct these celebrity interviews 'to pay the bills' for his investigative journalism, he can't bring himself to completely play along with the farce. The chapter breaks of songs by Dianne Reeves also represent how CBS was otherwise going on with entertainment programming (as well as a tribute to the director's Aunt Rosemary), emphasized by a line that Milton Berle was then the most trusted name in television.But all these references and cultural touchstone may well go over the heads of anyone under 50, and there were none in my audience of a fairly crowded suburban multiplex with defective projection quality. Will they even know that Murrow was a patriotic icon for his war time radio broadcasts from the London Blitz, or what were the Wobblies that McCarthy accused him of being a member of, or who was Roy Cohn, or even the flashes of RFK as a staffer on the HUAC committee, PM Magazine, the Red Channels newsletter editor who confronts one of the reporters, or the senators who discovered their backbones after Murrow showed that the emperor had no clothes. This will doubtless be the first they hear names such as Bill Paley and Frank Stanton. Unusually for this kind of film there is no concluding scroll that reminds viewers of the distinguished careers of the participants, such as Don Hewitt, producer of '60 Minutes.' The dialog does have an ironic exchange about what happens to McCarthy.The connections to today's issues of the Patriot Act and the means justifies the ends in anti-terrorism, particularly now that television is used far more slickly than by McCarthy, are emphasized by Strathairn's Murrow several times stating that it is the methodology of the accusations he is concerned with, as he stresses process, procedure and the rule of law overcoming innuendo, implication, smears and out and out distortion and lack of facts.Clooney's Fred Friendly creates an easy partnership with Strathairn's Murrow, as he's just barely off the TV screen as they create the famous broadcasts together, even as Friendly jokes about Murrow risking the most as the most visible.In addition to a beautiful black and white texture that smoothly integrates the original footage, Clooney's gliding directing helps to build the tension. Several scenes of silent waiting for count downs and a phone to ring are as tense as 'Apollo 13.'",10,4,8,24 October 2005
Mulholland Drive," Intriguing Sights and Sound for Not Much Point
","'Mulholland Drive' is 'Twin Peaks' redux, including its genesis as a planned TV series. Only instead of taking on the quirks of the Pacific Northwest, David Lynch plays on a Hollywood setting, gleefully spinning on artifice and dreams, with many references to other movies, including 'The Day of the Locust,' 'The Wizard of Oz,' and 'The Hucksters.'The lush cinematography, music and carnival of character actor cameos almost make up for the interminable colorful red herrings that wouldn't be out of place on the old 'Dallas' and a glacial pace.We see all of the two striking young lead starlets as fetching eye candy to pass the time, giving us both blonde and brunette femmes fatale. I was blown away by a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' done by performance artist Del Rio, but I'm not sure what it had to do with anything.Just as we know that Picasso could draw realistically, we know from 'The Straight Story' that Lynch can in fact do a straight narrative. He just chooses not to. (originally written 10/21/2001)",5,0,2,29 November 2005
8 Mile," Explosive, 21st Century Take on the Macho Rock 'n' Roll Movie
","'8 Mile' forcefully brings rock' n' roll movies into the 21st century.While it has striking similarities to Elvis Presley and Beatles movies in how it uses autobiographical elements to make its similarly charismatic lead star comfortable in a new medium to sort of present his own story, Curtis Hanson's direction and the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto (of 'Amores Perros') create a thrilling environment for him to explode.Like 'L.A. Confidential,' Hanson is terrific at getting up close in macho environments and bringing us right into their verbal and actual violence. While I'm quite sure my ignorance of hip hop slang and culture led me to miss references and the point of much conversation, it did seem to me that Hanson captured the why and how behind Eminem's rage.The movie's climax is the epiphany when his constructive genius takes over as he learns to channel his anger into his lyrics, and to even take it a level beyond the insulting toasting of the local Detroit battle-of-the-rappers to forge a new persona (what will eventually become Slim Shady among other images) and a new kind of rap that will sweep the nation.It is ironic that here in Detroit (or as the dialog and the credits call it - the 313) how few of the young adults have cars (even though Eminem's character is working in an auto parts plant), and are constantly cadging rides from each other to avoid the humiliation of taking the bus. Of course the women in this desolate Motor City, that is an urban recall of the 'Mad Max' movies, are either beloved innocents or are traitorously duplicitous; I was taken aback how much of a calculating groupie Brittany Murphy's character is, unlike the usual devoted, loyal girlfriend in such movies.If the closing song is originally written for the movie (and I don't know if the sing-along audience had seen the movie before or knew the soundtrack), it should be considered for Academy Award 'Best Song' as it brilliantly describes the movie and the character's post-life. It was not appropriate, however, for a parent in the row behind me to bring a small child to this film (and not just because the kid talked through the whole movie); even if they expose them to profanity-laded rap music at home, this is a mature movie with mature scenes that would be quite disturbing to young children.(originally written 12/15/2002)",9,4,5,19 December 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," See on the Big Screen for The Delightful Sights and Sounds
","'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a visual and aural delight, even with the worn-out print I saw as probably the last New Yorker to see the film. The production design and Danny Elfman's music are worth a movie screen experience, and the script occasionally shows the cynical and whimsical flair that Roald Dahl was known for, including updated cultural references, such as very funny satires of MTV.Never having read the book, so I don't know what was faithful, changed or updated, nor have I seen the earlier adaptation, so this was my first experience with the story and it could be this generation's The 'Wizard of Oz.' Even if the visuals are consistent with the book's descriptions and did not spring from director Tim Burton's conception, the details are wonderful. Outstanding are how the choreography and deadpan of the multiplying Oompa Loompa, portrayed by the obviously up for anything Deep Roy (and sung by Elfman), are wonderful in those marvelous settings. The rest of the acting amidst the sets and blue screens, other than 'Charlie's parents --nice to see Noah Taylor playing someone relatively normal for a change--and grandparents, are a bit weak. While the other children's parents besides James Fox are just plain bland and have wavering accents, Johnny Depp is simply unappealing, from his voice and body language to his make-up, and not just because he's creepily like Michael Jackson. His occasional tart jibes show refreshing flashes of spirit that make the rest of his performance just that much more dull. Christopher Lee adds his usual panache to the typical movie stereotypes of an evil dentist, though surely the floss reference is not from the book. Freddie Highmore as 'Charlie' is more earnest than natural. Geoffrey Holder's narration sounds charming. It's not only lovely to hear his Caribbean lilt, but it's nice to know that Morgan Freeman doesn't have the monopoly on voice-overs. Though the ending comes a bit close to cloying, the film does not talk down to children, who should be able to appreciate the lessons the very funny annoying kids are taught.",6,1,2,22 September 2005
Black Hawk Down," Superficial Shoot-'em-Up
","I went to 'Black Hawk Down' mostly for the line-up of hunks, and it had even more than the highly advertised ones, including Sam Shepherd as the grizzled general and a bunch of guys who I recognized late in the film, such as Ron Eldard and Jeremy Piven, and some whose names I only recognized in the credits. Ewan MacGregor was on screen for a few minutes and director Ridley Scott should have yelled 'Cut!' when his English accent painfully came through, but as a Brit himself I guess he didn't notice.Eric Bana kept his Ozzie accent under control after awhile (and I wonder if his character, one of the few memorable ones, was the guy who we are told at the end is now in jail for severe wife abuse or if I'm projecting from his staggeringly violent role in 'Chopper'.) But this is no ogle-fest: it's a problem that the guys are completely unrecognizable as I simply couldn't keep anybody straight, especially once they put their helmets on and the shooting started. Couldn't they have bent reality a bit more and given each primary character different, non-buzz-cut hair cuts? Or at least have a few more with their names on their shirts or helmets? 'Band of Brothers' was easier to follow than this troupe, like 'Thin Red Line' as well.While many critics have complained about the short shrift given Somalis and overall tactics and strategy, what I thought was even more of a problem was the Army's blithe neglect that these guys are not trained to counter urban guerrilla action. Maybe riot cops would have been better prepared, or maybe that's the future of peacekeeping actions that needs to be prepared for.And all the laser gizmos can't replace understanding of local politics. There's fleeting reminders when we suddenly see a schoolteacher huddling to protect her students and a father/son attack team. This is mostly just a shoot-em-up. Lots and lots of shooting. The music choices were mostly good and unbombastic, though some of the old rock 'n' roll choices didn't make sense for today's hip hop Army.(originally written 1/20/2002)",6,2,7,22 December 2005
For Love of the Game," A Sports Romance Where the Sports is Better than the Romance
","I'm a fan of sports romances as a genre, especially for date movies, but in 'For Love of the Game,' the baseball is better than the romance as the relationship just doesn't make a whole lot of sense, though it is hard for a perfect game attempt to be made visual.I did enjoy how oblivious the women in the movie were to ESPN, because if I didn't live with baseball fanatics I'm not sure I'd notice details of the season. I'm not sure all the other parts of the females' lives made sense (I'm the kind who worries about who's with the kid when the mother is off on a romantic weekend).Kevin Costner still doesn't understand that if he's going to insist on marketing himself as a close-up, big screen sex symbol then he has to put as much time into working out on his body as women movie stars have to, cruel as the camera is, though the list of credits was full of 'Mr. Costner's trainer', 'Mr. Costner's hairstylist', 'Mr. Costner's coach', etc. I still like his so-American dialog delivery, but it's his too-long, pensive, tortured close-ups that don't work as well, except towards the end where manliness has to deal with emotion and he was quite effective there.(originally written 9/26/1999)",2,1,3,8 November 2005
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Takes Time Finding the Real Person Under the Wigs
","Not having seen the off-Broadway version of 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch,' I can only judge it as a movie (and after hearing long, hagiographic interviews with star/director John Cameron Mitchell using his opposite whispery persona on radio shows).It works as a rock musical through the cute conceit of the songs being part of 'Hedwig's' cross-country stalking tour of her sweet-faced young protégé, though the raucous songs have too much similarity, relieved by the change-of-tempo ballads. As another celebration of drag queens and/or transsexuals who use the exaggerated female image as minstrel shows use black-face caricatures, 'Hedwig' doesn't reach the heights of 'The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert' in understanding a real person under the wigs, as the set-up here is intentionally more campy.Just as I got tired of the gimmicks, the movie finally fulfilled itself as the self-realization of a gay man (and his reverse image partner) and became more human. Consequently I didn't buy the didactic we're all one sex theme, even as charmingly demonstrated through the interstitial back-story explanation animation by Emily Hubley.'Hedwig' uses similar editing techniques and tone as Ken Russell's 'Tommy,' achieved with a lot smaller budget and less cinematography quality.(originally written 7/27/2001)",6,2,3,19 December 2005
Big Fish," A Rigidly Brittle Defense of the Storyteller as Artist
","I know what I was supposed to be feeling as I watched 'Big Fish,' as Tim Burton banged me over the head with his theme on the importance of the storyteller enlivening our drab existence, but he was so insistent and rigid in this that I thought the whimsy and charm were drained out. 
Maybe because I was more won over more by Billy Crudup as the cynical son living in the real world than Albert Finney as the tale-spinner who straddles reality and fantasy with Jessica Lange as his still-blonde devoted Stepford wife.  I'm a big fan of magic realism, from Bedford Falls to even 'Neverending Story,'  but the fantasy elements here were too brittle, starting with Ewen MacGregor, who shows none of Finney's 'Tom Jones' flare when enacting his younger self, and the preternaturally too bright smiles that everyone stiffly wears in the stories to match the too bright M & M artificial colors cinematogragraphy by Philippe Rousselot under too much make-up, including on Alison Lohman, though she eerily mimics Lange's body language as her younger self. Part of the fantasy includes the very fake Alabama accents, which are Network Standard Southern, even though they filmed near Mobile.
I wasn't sure if it was an intentionally transitional point in the movie as the fantasy elements start to intersect with the real world that we jarringly hear for the first time period-appropriate songs with '5 O'clock World' and the Allman Brothers' 'Travelin' Man.'  The closing song by Eddy Vedder and Pearl Jam was lovely.",Null,0,0,11 January 2004
"Girl, Interrupted"," Jolie Is Better than the Story Line
","I primarily went to see 'Girl, Interrupted' for Angelina Jolie as I've been following her career since 'Hackers' and she's mesmerizing whatever she's in. She's camera-charismatic, like Greta Garbo and Bette Davis.I was pretty sure that the Winona Ryder character didn't need to be hospitalized and I was trying to figure out what we'd now say she, and the others, had and how they'd treat it -- depression?I thought the movie should have been over in the first hour or so when the boyfriend (sigh, Jared Leto) wants her to go off with him, though her decision not to seems to be a turning point in her mental health.This isn't exactly 'Snake Pit' because somehow it ends up that therapy is positive, but only because she decides to get well and throw herself into it. So the moral or point is a bit fuzzy. The two young women behind me hated it and talked back to the screen the whole time for her to get her act together.The '60's music choices are pretty good.(orginally written 1/23/2000)",6,0,1,8 November 2005
Green Street Hooligans," An Involving Examination of Men Gone Wild, but Too Anthropological
","'Green Street Hooligans' is a visually involving attempt at exploring the phenomenon of violent English football fans, but falls down through the story choice of approaching it through a cross-cultural and class perspective.Perhaps with an eye on the American movie market, co-writer/director Lexi Alexander chose not to use the docudrama style of 'Bloody Sunday' in trying to understand how a violent incident can explode, but instead almost anthropologically uses the viewpoint of a fish out of water participant observer. That distance is emphasized with an unnecessary and melodramatic voice-over, however, the angle of reporters seeking to go into this alternative universe is not unfounded paranoia as I remember reading a scandal some years ago about a 'journo' who did successfully go undercover with such a group and how shocking his reports were.We see middle class milquetoast, expelled Harvard student Elijah Wood as 'Matt Buckner' arrive in England with a belly full of family and class reasons to have pent-up anger at the world. He is accidentally drawn into a completely different world by a plot contrivance that is a poignant fulcrum to the film and its most interesting invention, his rebellious older sister's marriage to a guy who in any other British movie (and just about every other TV show or movie Marc Warren, as the husband, has been in) would be called 'her bit of rough.' No wonder he keeps calling her his 'angel.' It's a boundary-challenging, transgressive relationship that we haven't seen much in the movies since 'A Street Car Named Desire' and I would have liked to see more.While Wood's Americanness provides the excuse for the necessary translations of slang, sports nomenclature and social descriptions that I presume the British audience will find redundant, an American audience is more used to the innumerable movies about gangs (from the metaphorical 'The Warriors' or even alternative inner city groupings like in 'Rize') where race or ethnicity is a crucial element in male bonding and where the violence is expressed through guns rather than these primitive fists and whatever is handy. With the probably not incidental perspective of a female director, it also implies that movies like 'Romper Stomper' that assumed a political sheen to such activities misunderstand the pack instinct. With those factors removed, what you mostly have is testosterone on adrenaline reorganized around 'firms' that use sports teams as an excuse for their existence, so it's like 'Fight Club' crossed with 'Friday Night Lights' and 'Rollerball.' The editing emphasizes the emotional process of violence over its results in order to get across the participants' euphoria.This film may be about as authentic as 'Hustle & Flow' is about rappers and pimps, but as a fable of men gone wild it is involving. I could understand the dialog so ipso facto that must mean that the actors weren't speaking with authentic class accents. It comes as a shock to casually see that the hooligans are all in fact gainfully employed. For guys who emphasize their heterosexuality, we only see one in an ongoing relationship with a female, though, like with 'Lords of Dogtown,' we get a hint of admiring groupies. Charlie Hunnam's exaggeratedly swaggering alpha male is charismatic, if overly theatrical. The film is insightful at examining the sociology of the groups, showing how the beta male tries to prove himself to the alpha male by ratcheting up the action and distinguishing genuinely disturbed individuals that even the participants identify as 'an animal.' The recurrences of issues of family ties, father to son, brother to brother, emphasizes that male tribalism crosses class lines, as queasily indicated in the ambiguous ending. It misses an opportunity to link these goings on to 'Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room' by oddly and somewhat scarily transferring the hooligan behavior to middle class vengeance on the upper class.Other than the chillingly recurring team cheers that recall 'A Clockwork Orange,' the song selections are good but are very limited, with repeat selections by one band, I guess due to music clearance costs, with, oddly, no metal and only one hip hop number, over the closing credits.This film almost makes a case for a mandatory draft of young men and limited wars to channel inevitable male aggression in groups.",7,0,0,24 September 2005
Pride & Prejudice," An Exuberant Interpretation Faithful to Austen
","'Pride & Prejudice' is a 'Gilmore Girls' take on Jane Austen and it is delightful.Much as I loved the BBC's mini-series the last decade and didn't think we could possible need another version, adapter Deborah Moggach (with help from Emma Thompson) and director Joe Wright have shot the story through with adrenaline so that everyone is a lot more lively (with a throw down to the 1940 version as being portrayed by too-old folks and this is the first adaptation where all are the right age). This is a classic personified by emotional people not stuffed icons.While there is too much landscape admiration from the opening dawn on, the crowded Bennet household is immediately captured as filled with five noisy, twittering sisters surrounded by household laundry. This liveliness is particularly noteworthy in the simply danced ball scenes, which are as crowded as a downtown dance club and are brimming with youthful energy and flirtations (this is the first adaptation I've seen that clearly distinguishes between public and private balls in costumes and attitudes). While fully clothed in modest period costumes, the exuberance injects the awareness of bodies as a visual subtext.This constant buzz serves as a marvelous foil for an extremely dour, almost Eeyore-gloomy 'Mr. Darcy' and serves to emphasize his social awkwardness in situations where every young non-snob is just having a jolly good time. Surrounded as he is by much more amiable guy friends, just when you think that Matthew MacFadyen's 'disagreeable man' could not possibly appeal to Keira Knightly's live wire 'Elizabeth Bennet,' he creates sudden sexual tension in the pouring rain at his first, obnoxiously-worded proposal that builds up to a moment as charged as Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed on the phone in 'It's A Wonderful Life.' He later in the relaxed comfort of his own home splits the screen with a warm smile that suddenly makes the viewer (and 'Lizzie') aware of his beautiful blue eyes, though we don't get to see his sister's startled response to their pre-Spencer/Hepburn competitive raillery.The men are portrayed much more sympathetically and rounded than previous versions, for the benefit of the few guys in the audience dragged by the women in their lives. Though dad Donald Sutherland, barely trying to do a British accent but enjoying not being the villain he's been playing recently, prefers solace with his pigs, oddly, to dealing with his family as much as in his library, his paternal affection clearly comes through and he is more bemused, as in the book, than hen-pecked, as in other adaptations. Though we don't get to hear 'Darcy's charming soldier cousin's speech about how he needs to marry a woman with money to balance 'Lizzie's best friend's similar practical analysis, we do see, quite amusingly, just how anxious and nervous both 'Darcy' and 'Bingley' are in the presence of the objects of their affections. We are all indeed fools in love.Knightly starts out seeming to be more 'Jo' from 'Little Women,' but shines with the fast-paced repartee, especially in scenes where she talks circles around the socially inept 'Darcy,' let alone his snobby friends and relatives. Her 'gotcha' scenes of self-realization, however, are less effective than the comparable moments by Emma Thompson in 'Sense and Sensibility' or 'Gwyneth Paltrow' in Emma as the director substitutes extensive close-ups for expressions that would communicate her intelligent thoughts. The frequent shots slowly going out of focus, usually to indicate time passing, are also annoying.There is great emphasis on the social satire, with humor from chuckles to laugh out loud funny, propelled by the busy music (which despite the complaints of the woman in back of me was of the period), and the crowded matinée I saw it at the opening weekend responded actively. Tom Hollander is a marvelous 'Mr. Collins' without making the minister too clownish. Brenda Blethyn brings unexpected depth to the exasperating 'Mrs. Bennet,' even if her riposte to 'Mr. Collins' that they can still afford a cook and warning to 'Lizzie' about just wait until you have five daughters aren't in the book. Dame Judi Dench is in no need of tight close-ups to carry off 'Lady Charlotte', as she could be imperious to the last row of Giants Stadium, despite a hair-do that does seem more 1970's New Jersey than Second Empire. Jena Malone has a ball in what might be her first period work, even as her rambunctious 'Lydia' falls to temptation as other characters she has played. Theopulence of 'Darcy's Pemberley is so staggering that it does make 'Elizabeth' seem too impressed by his wealth and gives quite a ring of truth to his professed prejudices against her. The opening shot with its lake does tease us about the BBC version as he does not emerge from the lake. It is also a bit obvious to put sensuality forefront to have the mansion filled with voluptuous sculptures rather than the paintings and portrait gallery described in the book.While the erotic mise en scene of the second proposal is more out of Bronte than Austen (my sister-in-law was shocked to see them perambulating outdoors practically in their nightclothes), 'Darcy's lengthy, open-shirted stride through the mists of dawn practically elicited swoons from the audience. A for some reason U.S.-only coda is completely faithful in spirit to the book, which did not end in the double wedding so frequently falsely portrayed in adaptations, even if the dialog itself, oddly, was not, as there is a parallel interchange that could easily have been used.The great bulk of the dialog throughout the film is directly from Austen, though the writers had to invent romantic dialog where she otherwise dryly says that the couples converse as one would expect those 'violently in love' to do. And that is the timelessness of this story that this film ebulliently brings to life.",10,5,12,14 November 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Lovely Roller Coaster Ride Through the Tricks Memory Plays
","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is the best adaptation of a story that Philip K. Dick never wrote.  There's glimpses of movies actually inspired by Dick, like 'Paycheck'and 'Total Recall,' as well as elements from 'The Neverending Story' with its encroaching 'nothing' to 'Groundhog Day' to Pinter's 'Betrayal' or 'Memento,'and the various permutations of 'Here Comes Mr. Jordan.' 
But it's altogether completely original in the inventive writing imagination of Charlie Kaufman and visualization by video-maker Michel Gondry, known more up to now for illustrating Bjork's odd songs. Yes, it takes awhile to quite figure out what's going on until you can sort out what's contemporaneously happening before your eyes, what's dream, what's memory, what's fantasy, and what's flashback -- within a one-person 'Rashomon' roller coaster ride we literally see the tricks memory plays that allow people to fall in love with people who bring out something new in them, and then try to stay in or out of love with them. 
Almost every actor plays against their usual type -- here Kate Winslet is the kooky, spontaneous one, even more so than in 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'Hideous Kinky' (tracking her hair colors helps you track the film's trajectory and her British accent only slips through twice), Jim Carrey is the serious, shy introvert (though his comedic talents fit nicely as the character incongruously explores the hidden recesses of his subconscious), and Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are nerds living vicariously, though Kirsten Dunst is a similar nymphet as in 'Bring It On.'Unlike most of the films this borrows from, 'Eternal Sunshine' has a humanistic heart -- yes, love hurts, but we wouldn't trade a moment of the pain for the pleasure it brings.  And well-worth seeing again to try and remember it better. Lovely score by Jon Brion that helps ratchet up the tensions without overwhelming them.  While the LIRR is used nicely as a setting and metaphor, I'm not 100% convinced that the suburban scenes were filmed in what they claim is Rockville Centre, LI, as it looked more like parts of NYC to me -- which would be a nice change for Queens or wherever standing in for another locale.",Null,0,1,21 March 2004
The World's Fastest Indian," Hopkins is Charming in Thin Story of An Obsessive Quest
","'World's Fastest Indian' is a fairly charming road movie, but, even as based on a true character, Anthony Hopkins's obsessive Mr. Magoo wears thin. As a straightforward story of the eccentric retiree Burt Munro who from faraway New Zealand dreams of breaking a speed record in Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats with the titular home-jiggered motorcycle that he entertainingly fixes like McGyver's mechanic, the film lacks the poignancy or self-reflection of 'The Straight Story'. Hopkins in a promotional interview noted how Munro's obsessions had driven off friends and family, but we get little sense of those conflicts other than neighborhood annoyance at his messy lawn. The opening scenes at his home base have the feel of 1960's authenticity. He takes wry note of what others view as symbols of mortality that he has avoided - graves, war, the flu pandemic, cigarette smoking, etc. -- but he sees all that as proof of his luck.Even if true (and I haven't seen director Roger Donaldson's documentary this is based on), he seeks his fortune by meeting up with a rainbow too full of too colorful characters -- roustabouts, a Hollywood transvestite, a real Indian in Nevada, a soldier on leave from spraying Agent Orange in Viet Nam (a sweet Patrick Flueger), a randy widow (Diane Ladd unusually over the top) among other older women repetitively giving him the eye and more, a Latino car dealer (Paul Rodriguez in a non-comic role), before reaching fellow speed junkies gathering for 'Speed Week.' Yeah we get that he was dependent on the kindness of strangers. Hopkins keeps his character consistent throughout, from the accent to the partial deafness, childlike trust and compulsive focus on details. It is nice to see that he can do a regular guy and not just ego-maniacal geniuses, presidents, dictators, emperors, murderers, etc., and without hiding behind make-up or costumes.The cinematography by David Gribble of his highway journey from the California docks to an Utah we haven't seen in films before is lovely. The speeding scenes are fun roller coaster rides.",6,3,8,23 February 2006
Toy Story 2," Very Funny!
","Despite the baby who screamed in back of me for the entire 'Toy Story 2' (so much for picking an evening showing to try and avoid that), I adored this follow-up.The references to 'Star Wars' are very very funny (though not a single other person in the audience of very young children with their parents got them).Randy Newman's music is not as good as the original, except for a beautiful ballad sung by Sarah McLaughin. I did expect more from the Riders in the Sky (I'm a big fan of theirs) involvement of cowboy songs, but then none of the audience got the references to boomer TV shows either as the parents in the audience were way younger than me.Kelsey Grammar was mis-voice cast as the old prospector; he's best as Sideshow Bob on 'The Simpsons;' I don't know why they didn't pick a wily Western voice instead of snobby Eastern voice. Joan Cusack was a live wire as a cowgirl. Wayne Knight was as terrific a villain like in 'Jurassic Park.'But the animation was fun and the story quite clever. I figure the theme of playing and loving toys rather than saving them for collectors benefits Disney in the long run, as they encourage people to buy two of each!The 'outtakes' at the end are also funny satires.(originaly written 1/16/2000)",9,6,8,21 December 2005
The Last Samurai," Tom of Japan is Ridiculous!
","'The Last Samurai' has been quite accurately skewered as 'Dances With Samurai,' but that only begins to get across how ridiculous this movie is, as, in contrast, I liked 'Dances With Wolves.'  At least 'Lawrence of Arabia' was based on a true, if improbable, story on how an Occidental gets caught up in the Mysterious Orient (as the Mideast too was called then), takes on traditional values, and becomes a Great Military Leader, while this is pure bunk fiction.  Or does he travel east because this is one group of people that for the most part Tom Cruise can be taller than? How can Cruise's disillusioned Civil War veteran adopt a culture that he and we actually don't even learn about, other than a few words of Japanese.  One can certainly learn more from watching 'Yojimbo' or a number of other Akira Kurosawa films than the zero one gets here, The one-on-one fight scenes are not only unconvincing once, but director Edward Zwick takes one tutoring fight and repeats it three times, one time even in slo-mo.  It is out and out laughable that the head samurai speaks fluent English, let alone the surprisingly accessible Emperor; at least in old World War II movies the general always says: 'You are surprised I speak your language? USC, Class of '38!' Maybe he went to USC class of 1838? Is that how he came to be so well informed about the American Indian Wars (but not about classical Greek military history)? The romance is much played up on the trailer but mostly consists of curious and longing glances that could be out of an Austen novel, plus the mandatory cliche shot of the bland beauty discreetly bathing by a stream. 
And I was a bit confused as an audience member that I was being manipulated to cheer for an American who joins a fanatical resistance against an effort to open up a foreign country to Western influences, corrupt as they might be, and grovels with blind allegiance to an absolute monarch while in effect yelling 'Bonsai!' against an army of ill-trained peasant conscripts. Hmm, isn't that what John Walker was doing in Afghanistan? 
The battle scenes are more like the naive brutality of old vs. new military technology showcased in 'Barry Lyndon' than the drama of 'Saving Private Ryan.' The repeating drum beats in the score, redolent of traditional Japanese drumming, are effective.",Null,1,3,20 December 2003
Inside Man," A Rollicking NYC Roller Coaster Ride that Is the Triumph of Brain Over Brawn in a Heist Film
","'Inside Man' is terrific thriller, teasing us constantly as it deliciously delivers brains over brawn. Reveling in its very NYC atmosphere, it has much of the grittiness of 'Dog Day Afternoon' crossed with the clever suspense of 'The Usual Suspects'. Following Clive Owen's arresting monologue to the audience that alerts us to pay attention to the clues ('I'm only going to say this once' - though that's repeated at the end after we are realizing what he really meant), the opening scenes set up that director Spike Lee is for the first time using the clashing, unmelted pot of NYC's divergent races and immigrants not as a hortatory end in itself but to heighten and color what could have been just another perfect crime heist movie.Reversing the trek of 'The Warriors', we are immediately on a relentlessly purposeful tour of the length of Brooklyn from Coney Island through its diverse ethnic neighborhoods representing the corners of the globe to the gargoyles of Wall Street, the center of the world's financial power, all to the rollicking beat of a symbolic 'Bollywood Joint' featuring Panjabi MC, a leader in the bhangra blend of dance and Indian diaspora pop music. When we are first introduced to various ethnic types among the cops and the bank customers I was afraid that Lee was doing his broad brush stereotypes again as he did to nasty effect in 'Summer of Sam', but instead it's all slyly setting up the red herrings, cul-de-sacs and final outcome in Russell Gewirtz's roller coaster ride of a debut feature script. Some of the best dialog is in pointed exchange of raw identities that almost trump the main action, whether an Albanian or Sikh or Armenian or Jewish grandmother or racist officer or sexist punk or rich WASP Park Avenue CEO, plus we see NYC's rainbows of Asians, Latinos, workers and politicians, old and young. Many of the lines are laugh out loud funny and marvelously ironic.Owen plays on the cold bad Brit stereotype we've seen from Alan Rickman in 'Die Hard' to Paul Bettany in 'Firewall' before doing his version of the right thing while the smart alecky boy amusingly recalls the fresh kid inevitably nicknamed Brooklyn who is in every World War II movie troupe, as he shocks the bank robber with his violent and racist video game (played while they're sitting in the bank vault). Everybody has prejudices or pre-suppositions or a deal to make that are confused by the robbers' physical and strategic masks (coincidentally recalling the symbolic use of the Guy Fawkes' masks in 'V for Vendetta') and cleverly edited shuffling of positions. The flash forward interrogations of the hostages by a wily Denzel Washington -- who is just plain enjoying the tripping on his tongue of sharp dialog more than he had in his several other detective roles-- are jarringly integrated in with a grainy look throughout to give us revelatory clues about what is really going on to emphasize that we can't assume anything about anyone we see even when he seems just too suspicious. This is a constantly keep 'em guessing story with visual bread crumbs dribbled out for us to follow. It's nice to see Jodie Foster play a tough broad who is a talker not an action hero, even if her smarmy fixer doesn't make 100% sense in the plot, though her nefarious negotiating in front of a flag tribute to 9/11 is a chuckle about the American Way. Christopher Plummer is repeating an elegantly corrupt type we've seen him do many times, most recently in 'Syriana', and his explication was a bit too conveniently delivered for the story. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Washington's partner and Willem Dafoe as the technocrat are underused throughout in restrained roles. While I appreciate that Washington's sexy girlfriend is given a career as a fellow cop, which is unusual for this genre, I was disappointed that she seems to be half his age. It was nice to see the usually comic Daryl 'Chill' Mitchell in a small serious appearance. The production design details of NYC accuracy are an utter delight, from real TV stations to the authentic feel of NYPD's handling of emergencies to the current Mayor's bull pen office at City Hall plus script references to real people in sports and government. Even the sound design reinforces the realistically gripping experience.Terence Blanchard's score is much less jazzy than his other works for Lee's films and matches the action and human variety we see on the screen.The gang's calling themselves variations of 'Steve' seems like an amusing crossing of Howard Hawks with Quentin Tarantino.The closing credits are generous in giving full attention to the very large ensemble by letting us match their personas to the actors.While the violence is more implied than real, but still scary, the dialog is full of rampant, explicit profanity so I was surprised that folks brought very young children to a matinée.",10,3,6,30 March 2006
Titanic," What Hollywood Is Best At - A Huge Extravaganza
","I went to see 'Titanic' for Leonardo DeCaprio - so what? (Heck I'd already seen Kate Winslet naked in 'Jude.' What - so guys don't go to the movies to see a certain 'Pretty Woman'? But it was inappropriate that people brought kids, what with kids talking and asking questions through the whole movie and the parents commenting back. This is a big Hollywood extravaganza but it doesn't mean that kids should be there as if it were 'Men in Black.'It's selling out every showing in my neighborhood. So it's the most expensive movie ever made. It's what Hollywood is good at regardless of where it was filmed and what other things could be achieved in this world with all that money.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Slavishly Faithful Adaptation
","'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is devotedly faithful to the book. The special effects, especially the Henson Creature Shop and the quidditch game, are fun, but not fantastically magical.There's a lot riding on those three kid leads, more than probably any kids can communicate; it makes one realize how much of the book really takes place inside Harry's head. The great British character actors are underutilized, especially John Cleese as nearly Headless Nick. The music is too loud and obvious. A must for fans of the books but this won't make any converts. It is long -- don't take kids too young to read the book; the little kids in our audience were screaming to go home already. (originally written 11/25/2001)",5,2,4,13 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Terrific Blend of Story, Effects and Showcase of Young and Old Actors
","'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is a wonderful treat for the fans of the books and the earlier movies in the series, as it wastes no time explaining anything to newbies.After the prologue, our first look at Harry reveals he's now a gangly young teen for even more visceral reaction than seeing Anakin Skywalker at the same gawky age in 'Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones' because here it's been the same actor who we have seen age on screen; I immediately vote for continuing with the trio of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley for the rest of the adaptations, as they are literally growing into their roles. (Though with them fitting in other movies in between these I do feel pangs of maternal guilt at their lost childhoods.) Twins James and Oliver Phelps as the Weasley twins have also developed more hunkily than the characters' in my imagination from the pages in the book.All of their rangy messiness is particularly apt as director Mike Newell better captures the ambiance of normal English boarding school life than the other films, from the dorms to the common and dining rooms and professors' offices to the horrors of the first formal dance and the first awkward stirrings of attraction to the opposite sex, which adds a lot of leavening humor to the adventure. The attention to detail in the production design is marvelous; I counted three people in the credits responsible for draperies. Hogwarts is notably more multicultural this year, and not just because of the international Tri-Wizard Tournament; it challenges American stereotypes to hear 'Cho Chang' speak with a Scottish brogue like the inimitable Maggie Smith does here too.Eliminating the dreary annual summer stay at the relatives helps to literally whoosh us fast into magical environs as it quickly moves to the creatively envisioned quidditch world tournament that is necessarily rushed but is still a lot of fun before capturing the spookiness of the stealth attack by the followers of You Know Who -- and viewers have to already know who he and Sirius Black are, the family relationships, and what are Death Eaters, poly juice, sorting, etc. One small weakness is that quidditch fans dress in the same outlandish nonsense as muggle sports fans, but the visiting tournament teams' costumes and choreography are even more fun than the opening ceremonies of the Olympics.Until that time in the future when a very long, faithfully done mini-series adaptation can be made, it's forgivable that in the rush to fit in as many climaxes as possible of the long, complicated story it is a bit hard to have story insights to make you care for the new characters, though they are played by charming youngsters, particularly handsome Robert Pattinson as Hogwarts' official tournament competitor, and the girl classmates who amusingly prove that female wizards mature earlier too. I appreciate the effort gone to cast a young Bulgarian as competitor 'Vicktor Krum' with the right physique, but it's a good thing he's seen quite briefly.I lost count at ten at the number of special effects companies in the U.S. and Britain involved in the production, but it did seem as if CGI was put to effective background service to quaintly old-fashioned models, animatronics and mattes that fit the Hogwarts environment. I was particularly impressed that no matter how cool an effect was, it wasn't repeated for preening purposes and always served the story, as did the music. The underwater scenes were wonderful. The landscape of Hogwarts, from the castle to the lake to the forest, have a real sense of geography. Those who did stay through all the credits were rewarded by being assured that no dragons were harmed in the production, as the dragon challenge was thrilling even as it fondly recalled Ray Harryhausen's mythic battles for a new generation. I was not as impressed with Liam Neeson's make-up for Vol de Mort, as he seemed too much like Marty Feldman's Igor in 'Young Frankenstein.'But even with all these impressive effects, the films remain a showcase of the richness of British acting talent, of artists who go from TV to theater to serious indie cinema to small roles in this populist extravaganza. Brendan Gleeson seems more avuncular as this term's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher than was in the book, while having fun with his body props. I thought Miranda Richardson was not even as obnoxious or tartily made up on screen as Rita Skeeter is in the books. But I hope they all are signed up for the long term, as this fourth film clearly ends like a serial and I look forward to the next film as much as I look ahead to the next book.",10,2,5,24 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," The Story and the Effects Still Grab in this Sequel
","I didn't see 'The Matrix Reloaded' until the fourth day early show, and it was still sold out enough that I had to squeeze into the third row, along with the babies, toddlers and little kids there despite the 'R' rating, and next to the guy with serious sleep apnea snoring problems. While I re-watched 'The Matrix' to bone up (and get re-enthralled -- I was just telling our IT guys at work when the whole computer system crashed all day that they needed to visualize the circuits connecting), I haven't yet read through the philosophical explanations at the official site, let alone listened to the discussions with spiritual authors on National Public Radio, or yet watched the background short films in the 'Animatrix' collection, so I had to ask my son (who was at the first 11 pm pre-opening day showing) for some explanations that I just didn't get -- I hadn't even gotten that Neo is an anagram for One.What I did get, besides the return of fun fight scenes and visually complicated sets, is that Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss still look really good together and that Neo's and Trinity's love anchors the tale (and provides for droll grist with villains and prophets).Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus shrinks a bit in stature because we now see him in the fuller context of the politics of Zion, the last human city, and its relationship to the Matrix, plus entanglement in a jealous triangle (one of several going on). Because an original element in the Wachowskis future universe, compared to most sci fi movies, in addition to choices, is human emotions.Doubtless there's already a few PhD theses on the strong role of women in the Matrix universe -- what will they make of the fact that Trinity never gets on top now that we finally get a discreet sex scene? No ambiguous falling in love with androids in this war with machines, like in 'Blade Runner,' but rather Zion celebrates human sensuality, complete with a multi-ethnic, city-wide prayer session that ends in a rave to the beat of taiko drums with a touch of 'Carmina Burana' (if I could be sure that those frequently recurring drums were on the soundtrack I'd get it, but Warner Brothers prefers marketing to teen-age boys with pedestrian metal tracks from which only the closing Dave Matthews Band re-mix stands out). Interestingly, the women all seem to find Salome's seven veils to dance in, while the men are still wearing their grubby long johns (not that Keanu looks bad in those).Yes, we have the return of Bullet Time and balletically choreographed martial arts, which works well except for the connecting shots where the CGI turns the actors too much into cartoons. The battle with the multiplying Mr. Smiths is a particular hoot. The freeway chase is noteworthy more for its length than originality of strategies, partly because I couldn't figure out how the Sentinels or the Albino Twins could be destroyed, though its second half turn-around did have me ducking.One weakness is, as the ever welcome Harold Perrineau (of 'Oz') comments, Neo does spend too much time 'doing his Superman thing' with flying heroics that could either be a tribute to those movies or just plain retreads.Stay through the ten minutes of credits for a preview of 'The Matrix Revolutions,' as 'Reloaded' ends with a serial-style cliffhanger.(originally written 5/18/2003)",8,0,1,19 December 2005
Mystic River," Powerful Examination of Adults Haunted By Their Childhoods
","'Mystic River' is a very American take on genres more usually evoked by Europeans, a sophisticated cross between the kitchen sink working class British films and the spare, family-style murder mysteries of Claude Chabrol and François Ozon, and that has only otherwise been achieved in the U.S. through whole seasons of 'The Sopranos.'The clues to the mystery are subtly given to us within the first ten minutes when we meet the very individual yet deeply connected characters embedded within a powerful sense of place, isolated from downtown and change by the titular geography, with the looming bridge a constant visual landmark, only a notorious traffic bottleneck to most Bostonians. My friend in Cambridge explains the geographical symbolism: 'The Mystic River is Boston's 'other river'--unlike the picturesque Charles, the Mystic is the working river lined with power plants, factories etc,---the neighborhood is supposed to be Charlestown--traditionally isolated, working class, old school so to speak,(and yes, much of Boston remains unpleasantly insular) that has been 'yuppified' over the last twenty-five years, especially since the mid-eighties when the Orange Line elevated train came down. The Tobin Bridge that you see connects Charlestown, part of the City of Boston with Chelsea to the east, a separate municipality. The Mystic and Chelsea Rivers flow together into Boston Harbor--the working docks are in Charlestown, Chelsea, and East Boston across the Harbor from the North End and from Charlestown. In point of fact, some of the scenes were filmed in East Boston, as well as the Fenway and Franklin Park in Jamaica Plain.'The accents aren't completely accurate, but at least some regionalism is attempted. Overlooking it from the bridge, one of the key trio early on calls it 'the old neighborhood,' as he's somewhat left it, as in parallel his wife has somewhat left him, but both keep feeling silent tugs to come back.Memory and time catches up to the audience too in seeing two of our finest actors as gray-haired fathers (very natural make-up and hair style work), but Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are masterful as damaged men and even more damaged parents haunted by their mutually touched yet separately karoomed past and present. They are living demonstrations of Faulkner's dictum 'The past is never dead. It's never even past,' with horrific consequences for all.The strong theme of the sins of the fathers keeps the men up front, but their wives are crucial fulcrums for loyalty and motivation, as they are in The Sopranos, and Laura Linney's and Marcia Gay Hayden's characterizations chillingly match the men one-on-one at the climax and conclusion.The constant sense of brooding unease is promulgated enormously by director Clint Eastwood's masterful music which floats up like a body in the river and keeps up the tensions in even quotidian-seeming scenes. Sound in general bubbles up for atmosphere, from Red Sox games to telephone rings.The cinematography is lusciously saturated (Tom Stern doing his first lead, up from lighting) for gray skies that ironically clear up to blinding sunshine at the uneasy end, for a neighborhood parade that celebrates Patriot's Day while most of Boston is doubtless cheering on the marathoners.

Enemy at the Gates," A Taut, Gritty War Movie Screaming to Come Out of a Drekky Melodrama
","I went to see 'Enemy at the Gates' with my husband, as I knew it was about his favorite battle of his favorite war that he watched continually on the Military Channel. After having to endure a harangue the whole way to the screen about how we would be seeing the real battle that won the war, not that inconsequential D-Day that 'Saving Private Ryan' made such a big deal about as the U.S. didn't come in until the Russians already had turned the tide, I asked could he please be quiet during the movie and refrain from commenting on inaccuracies, etc. until after. But other than the clarification I needed between the Battle of Leningrad and the Siege of Stalingrad which I always mix up (whoops, I think I just did it again), and Hitler's and Stalin's fallacies as military leaders in relation to the symbolic importance of the Volga (and the movie could have used more strategic explanations), he and I pretty much agreed about the movie.There's a taut, gritty war movie screaming to come out of a drekky melodrama. The best parts are the battles, of troops and individuals. The opening sequence of soldiers thrown from trains to boats to the front line is terrific and frightening.The one-on-one between Ed Harris's Nazi sharpshooter and Jude Law's hunter (though he doesn't do working class too convincingly) is exciting.The most captivating surprising is Bob Hoskins as Krushchev. He completely inhabits the character and brings him completely to blood and guts life - showing just what it takes to survive as a top man to Stalin.There was also more potential in Joseph Fiennes' political officer as insight into propaganda that is only occasionally effective (after all, 'Ryan' was similarly about a PR stunt).I thankfully dozed off during most of the ridiculous sub-plot of the love triangle. There appears to be only a couple of women living in this city, and they sure do get in the way, as these few can themselves provide multi-lingual translations, sex, food, lousy child care and brave sharpshooting.The music by James Horner is atrociously bombastic, wincibly so.(originally written 3/31/2001)",6,4,6,22 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better Than the First One
","'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' has better special effects than the first one. I lost count at six teams of special effect companies, including Industrial Light and Magic, but doubtless each one had different responsibilities, whether the wonderful Hogwart's Hall, or the spiders, or the flue powder travel, or the flying car, etc.Even at three hours not all the story details can be told, so the actors have to quickly mouth a lot of exposition.Too bad the excellent Brit actors are reined in, even Kenneth Branaugh.Only the red-haired kid emotes much.At least the music is less bombastically intrusive than the last one.So even with all the whiz bang it still isn't as magical as The Wizard of Oz.(originally written 12/24/2002)",7,1,2,19 December 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Violent Screwball Comedy of Literally A Battle Between the Sexes
","Up to just beyond the half-way point 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' works as a modern screwball comedy, a less dark 'Prizzi's Honor.' But the gloss of suburban satire turns unappealing when the violence first gets personal, then becomes like mutual S & M foreplay, if not disturbing abuse, and then goes completely over the top into military operations that make one wonder what has happened to law enforcement.Staging the final battle in an Ikea-type store seems like a lame attempt to restore the satirical element of two assassins who have been living undercover as suburbanites, but it looks and feels more like a video game, though the shiny cinematography emphasizes their brittle surface environment.So maybe it's not so much that their violence is an aphrodisiac as it is a wake-up call to stir latent emotions (including a 'Lethal Weapon 4'-like scars comparison) as certainly two of the most beautiful physical specimens on the planet do have sparkling chemistry together and each keeps up the battles of both wits and guts. Brad Pitt even occasionally shows some charming vulnerability and Angelina Jolie is a droll bad ass.The camera simply loves them and there is just enough banter to keep up interest in them as people when they are blowing up everything around them. But the dialog misses many opportunities to go any deeper into their psyches beyond cartoon characters.The contrasts in their businesses is amusing, with Pitt's casual headquarters anchored by motormouth mama's boy Vince Vaughn incongruously and vicariously planning mayhem, while Jolie manages an all-woman high tech, high gloss operation under cover as a temp agency, including Jennifer Morrison of 'House, M.D.' as yet another overly efficient assistant.The music mostly supports the comic undercurrent, including a Muzak take on 'The Girl from Ipanema' contrasting with other excellent Latino selections on the soundtrack.While once your stomach has been turned by the mutually destructive violence so that it's hard to keep laughing, this is mostly about Pitt and Jolie looking gorgeous and doing impossible things -- and they pull it off entertainingly. Ah if only real violence was about these fantasies and not terrorists.",6,1,3,7 July 2005
Glory Road," By The Numbers Supposed Inspirational Moment of Sports History
","Even with never having seen 'Remember the Titans,' 'Coach Carter,' 'Miracle,' or even 'Hoosiers,' etc. etc. I can still tell that 'Glory Road' is a pretty much by the numbers 'based on a true story' intended to be an inspirational moment of sports history. The best moments are those that are unique to this individual portrait of an ambitious small college basketball coach who makes the somewhat cynical decision just to win by exponentially integrating NCAA games through the recruitment and playing of black players in the early '60's. The tour of Northern and inner city neighborhoods, such as Gary, Houston and the South Bronx, and how he cajoles them and their families in to coming to El Paso is both entertaining and sociologically revealing of class issues at the time. I particularly liked a comment that the best job possibilities a black basketball prodigy had at the time was to play for the Harlem Globetrotters. But there are only the most trivial token efforts made to put any of this in historical context with brief flashes of TV news about the civil rights movement and the Viet Nam War, with passing references to black power, Martin Luther King and Elijah Mohammed. We hear lots of Motown music and occasional gospel which I guess is the source of the title that other wise eluded me (but 'People Get Ready' twice?), though very little country or Latin music despite the Tex Mex locale. We do get some rueful acknowledgment that this is a side light sport in Texas compared to football, as we saw in 'Friday Night Lights.'We get some of the usual threats scenes with racists of the period, both alumni supporters and on the road in the South -- though, oddly, none in El Paso. There is one more unusual scene where the white players somewhat uncomfortably try to participate in a black majority party; some of the best dialogs are these gingerly getting to know you black/white interchanges. Otherwise we see very little of their college life, but then playing college ball really is a full-time job. I was hoping for some ironic awareness that as well as seeing this story as a great civil rights victory of some kind that a coach was playing all-black starters and winning against larger schools with only token black players that this might have been the moment in time when somehow the message all started to go wrong: is this when the wheel turned so that education became a farce --and the only classes we see them in do seem to be dumbed down jock courses-- and all that mattered would be the human and other bling and signing to the NBA from high school? The sop is the brief glimpses we get of the real participants during the credits as we see an interview with the real legends, including coach Pat Riley, who lost to this team in college, and see pictures of the real players with brief descriptions of their career and family paths, many as teachers, including working as coaches from high school to professional leagues. How did it get from them to kids graduating with no non-basketball skills and no moral compass? Josh Lucas is personable as always, but he is the garden variety inspirational coach. If he said 'son' one more time, rather than referring to a player by name, I thought I'd scream. Emily Deschanel has almost nothing to do in a virtual traditional First Lady role as his wife who tolerates living in a boys' dorm with their little kids.Derek Luke is the stand out among the players. Their court action is very convincing. Jon Voight, with prosthetics, is marvelous in a virtual cameo as the nemesis, Coach 'Adolph' Rupp, of the Goliath they face in the finals. Of course, the credits hasten to add that Rupp later expanded his black roster and coaching staff.I know very little about basketball so I appreciated that all the games were narrated by sports broadcasters.Per any Bruckheimer produced movie, it is very loud. Looking back to this somewhat innocent experience as some bright shining moment doesn't change that the NCAA still needs to cleanse its soul. It's sad to see what colleges could have done with these opportunities for young black men.",7,6,13,9 February 2006
War of the Worlds," Just Another Day When The Planet Is Attacked
","This 'War of the Worlds' is just an overblown disaster movie. It is pretty much the old version with Gene Barry just updated with fancier, well-integrated CGI, a lot more extras and heavy-handed 9/11 references.We first see Tom Cruise as his working class 'All the Right Moves' character aged into 'Ray,' an irresponsible divorced dad. Then the aliens land and he spends the rest of the movie dealing with just one damn thing after another with his kids in trying to go over the river and through the woods to grandma's house.And that's it. There are only occasional thoughts in this movie's head.As a sci fi movie, the basic conception of the alien weapons gestating underground then kick-started by electromagnetic streaks of lightning is visually fun, if a bit of a 'Tremors' re-tread. We see the aliens and their weapons almost too close up so they lose their mysteriousness as a fear factor, though they look a lot like the unconvincing ones in 'Signs,' but of course with E.T. hands, and they may intentionally be a bit cheesy to recall the earlier version.(The Hensons' Creature Shop should really do all aliens.) As a post-apocalyptic examination of human reactions in the face of catastrophe, we get the usual, but very large, frantic crowds of panicked and fighting refugees and only glimmers of originality, particularly when Tim Robbins shows up as a shell-shocked survivor. But the film in general takes a much more individual survival view of vengeance than either 'Revenge of the Sith' or 'Batman Begins,' as this is supposed to be grounded in reality.The real references are hammered home with the kids twice asking dad 'Is this the terrorists?' after he staggers catatonic-ally home covered in white ash, streets capes full of posted notices of the missing, and falling (empty) clothes dropping slowly to the ground from up high.Notably, it is not Cruise's character who tries to be some sort of hero, but his teen son, well-played by Justin Chatwin. His rebellious exchanges with his dad are the most natural dialog in the film.A key decision point in how far 'Ray' will go to choose to take on family responsibility takes place off-screen, despite the PG-13 rating, which made me ponder how other directors would have shown that struggle not just more graphically but more emotionally. Let alone that because Cruise is such a big star we never for a moment worry about his survival, despite the number of times it sure looks like he's being blown up but his character doesn't even get injured. Director Steven Spielberg flirts with an homage to 'The Searchers' at the conclusion, but falls for a sentimental touch instead that had the whole audience a bit quizzical as to its believability, even as it stresses the family lessons learned.Dakota Fanning is annoyingly Hollywood precocious in the first half, but settles down naturally into scared kid.Some touches had a quizzical symbolism, such as the effort to reach Boston's Back Bay past frequent sign posts to 'Athens', the ex-wife being pregnant with the rich new husband (so how old was she when she left the seat of America's revolution to have their teenager?), the teen's school paper on the French occupation of Algeria, the undamaged Minuteman statue, and so on.It was nice to see the working class bit parts taken by actors from 'The Wire' and the best production design is in the early recreation of their dense, close-knit neighborhood, even if Cruise makes no effort to have a Jersey docks accent.John Williams' music is commendably more restrained than usual and the long patches with silence let you hear your breath catching and heart beating faster through the best, most tense scenes.",6,3,7,30 June 2005
Wedding Crashers," Unevenly Funny
","'Wedding Crashers' is unevenly funny. The first third very amusingly introduces the premise of the charming Owen Wilson and motor mouth Vince Vaughn as the titular con men suavely moving from divorce mediation to multi-ethnic celebrations and quickly earns its 'R' rating with brief nudity as they successfully bed their targets. It is cute that all the dances climax with the Isley Brothers' 'Shout.' The pair are just funny riffing off each other. The second third drags down in 'Philadelphia Story'-like competition with a post-wedding WASP-y family weekend. While Jane Seymour as the randy matriarch adds some humor, her character's tipsiness, as well as the grandmother's senile comments, just become yet another stereotype in the household. The boyfriend is just plain crassly mean (even if his punches don't seem to have any lasting impact on anyone), particularly disconcerting as Bradley Cooper usually plays nice guys. The brother's character is way too broadly drawn odd, like a homophobe's idea of a gay guy, if Igor from 'Young Frankenstein' was a closeted homosexual. Christopher Walken is given far too little to do; even as his scenes build up to expectations, he's not allowed to let loose.What lights ups this section is Isla Fisher as a sister who turns male fantasies on their head. Even her Mutt and Jeff size difference with Vaughn is amusing. The women show spunk in the first two-thirds then are just blanded down to smiles. Rachel McAdams (as a brunette this time) has lines with personality at first, but then just becomes an object of affection, even as she gets in a nice dig that Wilson isn't that young any more, as he is obviously quite older than she. The last third has some funny twists, particularly with an unexpected cameo and some outrageousness before it settles into conventionality. The final wedding is at least not a repeat of 'The Graduate.'The camera work is pedestrian, with close-ups indicating serious thinking.",5,0,1,23 August 2005
Ice Age," Laugh Out Loud Funny
","'Ice Age' is a lot of fun! It's laugh out loud funny, even though it's not 'Shrek' or 'Chicken Run' but it's definitely entertaining for adults, including shots like a passing reference to 'The X Files' movie and showing why the dodo became extinct. Sure it sticks with Disney-established cartoon clichés of orphaned kid, wisecracking side-animal and nature that's scary and dangerous.But the odd trio of stand-up comics with thick New York accents of Ray Romano, Denis Leary and John Leguizamo work really well off each other.I didn't recognize the voice of Goran Visnjic from 'E.R.' as the villain.I was disappointed that they didn't bother to do any original songs, just a recap of the old Rusted Roots song 'Send Me On My Way,' though that does happen to be a fave of mine.(originally written 3/17/2002)",8,0,0,22 December 2005
Downfall," Gripping Docudrama
","'Downfall (Der Untergang)' is a gripping docudrama that brings the History Channel to life, though I missed the contextual-providing talking heads and pop-up explanations, especially to know if there was anything new or revisionist in this German view of Hitler's last days in his bunker with his inner circle.As I am not a regular devotee of military channels, I frequently got confused and misplaced among the ensemble, such that I really needed the closing snapshots to tell me who was whom and what happened to them after the film ends at surrender (documenting that suicide preempted many from being Nuremberg defendants). While I thought these might have been tenacious yes men, my husband does watch those programs and he explained that these advisers were with Hitler from the beginning, unlike Stalinist purges.My husband also pointed out that some of Hitler's rants, chillingly portrayed by a dynamic Bruno Ganz, are not just paranoid ravings but accurately reflect his clashes with the upper class Prussian career military men who were naysayers to his pre-Stalingrad military successes, whereas his perceptions of the final military situation were quite delusional, especially once the top brass were afraid to tell him the truth.Evidently, what are new are the quotidian insights of life in the increasingly bizarre bunker provided by Hitler's secretary, which were revealed before she died in a book and interview documentary 'Blind Spot (Im toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretärin', an edited version of which was shown on U.S. TV; my husband objected that even she didn't witness some of the scenes that are particularly tense so some poetic license is probably taken. While it is these personal touches that some have complained make Hitler human, I found it more interesting to learn about the inner circle, as he obviously couldn't conduct his reign of terror alone.The film distinguishes among a spectrum of Nazi ideologues and fellow travelers at all levels-- the most fanatic are shown here as strident caricatures, particularly a scary Frau Goebbels who makes Livia Soprano look like fun and games, career soldiers, patriots and civilians, including child recruits, while Eva Braun is shown to be naive to the point of lunacy.Like 'Rosenstrasse,' another contemporary German director's take on the period, director Oliver Hirschbiegel is determined not only to go beyond the old ignorance disclaimers to show the impact of World War II on ordinary Berliners as Hitler dismisses their plight (including, disconcertingly, a symbolically blond, blue-eyed boy whose travails outside the bunker we tensely follow throughout the film) and his loyalists throughout the ranks continue revenge until the last moments, though his insistence that there are no longer any civilians in this war could also apply to the London Blitz he fomented or the Allies' firebombing of Dresden. Just as the film seems to identify many reasonable Germans, including some at high levels, disgusted with war and the Nazis, both Hitler and Goebbals point out that they have been in power for decades with the acquiescence of the German people.While the script also carefully includes Hitler's paranoid anti-Semitism as part of his rabid philosophy until the end, the documentary coda about the facts of the Holocaust seem tacked on to assure audiences that the genocidal aspect of the Third Reich is not being ignored amidst choices of tactics, strategy, personality and loyalty.It's amazing that a docudrama whose outcome we already know can be so taut and riveting, such that you come out of the theater drained.",8,3,8,21 March 2005
The Green Mile," Overblown Treatment of Slight Story
","'The Green Mile' would have been a lovely little indie movie if it had been done small scale. Did it need the full Hollywood treatment of Tom Hanks and ILM special effects? No. It would have made a nice 2 -part Mystery episode on PBS.It also did not need to be 3+ hrs of v-e-r-y leisurely story-telling. Not having read the Stephen King book I don't know what got left out that made the auteur think this was an abbreviated version. David Morse, who is unsung too often, was quite fine. Michael Clarke Duncan added much needed humanity to the film.Interesting that like 'Saving Private Ryan,' an older actor is used for 50 years hence, not make-up laden as in the days of 'Little Big Man.'No reason to see this on a big screen; you can wait for commercial-free cable or video tape, what with lots and lots of close-ups.(originally seen 1/2/2000)",3,2,8,12 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Thrilling Capstone Overcomes CGI and Dialog for True Tragedy
","'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' is a thrilling capstone and revelation that more than a dozen hours over 28 years has built up a universe, a mythology and a galactic force whose fulcrum shockingly turns on a tear coursing down Anakin Skywalker's face. But, even after three viewings, it is moving and stunning that to discover that the prequels and sequels are merely exposition for that tear. I, too, cried, several times. Yes the eye is also filled with a far more elaborate production designed landscape and cityscapes than any previous 'Star Wars' movie could produce, what with all the advances in computer generated images, though with far less insight on life far, far away than was our first look at this society many years ago. The opening battles seem a replay we've seen before, even with a few new eye and ear catching characters, such as the stooped, coughing flesh-and-metal General Grievous, a foreshadowing of the future bad guy to come. But then we have the first hint that the physical battles are secondary to the central conflict - the battle for Anakin's soul.We are suddenly forced to recall his disturbing, seemingly uncharacteristic act from 'Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,' when the reckless, petulant teen wreaked Old Testament-like vengeance on the sand people for his mother's death that he had helplessly foreseen (and it is important throughout to recall revealed information from Episodes I and II that we may have understandably dozed through for its boring, seeming insignificance then, including that a Sith was more than just another colorful enemy). We had excused this violence due to his grief, his youth, and perhaps because it uneasily recalled incidents in our human, and particularly American, history. But Christensen's Anakin has filled out into a striding, strikingly handsome young man in the prime of life, saving his mentor Obi-wan Kenobi time and again, who surely can now be in control of his expanded powers. Until Ian McDiarmid's chillingly curdling Chancellor starts openly manipulating Anakin's emotions and slowly begins to tie together the whole series for us and reveals that he, through at least three guises, has been pulling the story strands together all along and will continue to do so. As we try to keep track of the various political machinations of the Chancellor and the Jedi Council, our hearts go out to Anakin as he struggles to be faithful to everyone he has trusted, even as each asks him to keep conflicting secrets from the others, ironically by insisting that he 'trust your feelings.' But each has a different version of the truth. It is heartbreaking that he does try to reach out more than once for Jedi guidance, but Yoda's ascetic spirituality can't ease his excruciating torment. Despite stiflingly wooden dialog in bedroom, banter or battle (such that no other actor's abilities are to be judged by the recitations here) we are drawn into a totally unexpected anguish -- Anakin's tragic flaw is his love for Padme. Yes, it is compounded by his arrogance, his anger, his pride, his hubris, his impatience, but we've seen those character flaws develop from being told by the Jedi he's The Chosen One, what with the extraordinary level of those mysterious midi-chlorians coursing through his body. So he freely--slowly, painfully, reluctantly-- makes the choice that will change the fate of an entire universe. His next actions are shocking -- earning the PG-13 rating just for the idea of what he's done, not that we see him do it, emphasized by surrounding him in an Albert Speer-ish mise en scene. The final, extended confrontation with Kenobi on a volcanic planet is viscerally gripping, the absolute best light saber battle ever, even as it follows skirmishes between other familiar characters that are also exciting (and it is fun to see the Wookie home world). The political ruminations about liberty morphing into totalitarianism, recalling Hitler's election and a singular super-power on this planet, while looking ahead to how Princess Leia will fulfill her mother's goals for The Rebel Alliance, are dark secondary themes.But the transformation to Darth Vader that we know will be coming, has to come, that is inevitable and necessary to come because we already know the conclusion of his life is far more terrifying than we ever expected, especially as it is edited back and forth between what will bring us directly to 'Episode IV: A New Hope.' We never would have thought that what he did, he did for love. Back in 1977, George Lucas tried to tell interviewers that Anakin's arc was what the whole series was about, but we thought that Vader escaping in a pod was simply a 'to be continued' gimmick and didn't get it. None of us did. Until now.",8,9,16,5 June 2005
Ray," Effective Recreation of Ray Charles and His Milieu
","'Ray' is an effective recreation of Ray Charles and his milieu. Jamie Foxx is extraordinary in completely embodying Charles, but the terrific production design gives him important context. Without the authentic feel of the mid-twentieth century Florida of his childhood, and the blues and jazz chitlin circuit and the recording and entertainment industries of his young adulthood, Foxx's performance would just be an imitation. This context is particularly important because Charles was an innovator and unique commingler of influences, gospel with R & B, blues with country, smooth jazz with funk (and thankfully the soundtrack mostly doesn't try to imitate him, but uses his voice for the incomparable songs -- and stay through the end of the credits to hear the final moan). Vernel Bagneris's choreography was much more authentic looking than in similar period movies, especially in showing the transitions black music was making post-World War II. Also realistic feeling is the verisimilitude of Atlantic Records, including the late engineer Tom Dowd, radio payola, and other business dealings. The film provides fulsome opportunities for many African-American actors who don't get enough opportunities to be seen, including several actors from TV series like 'The Wire' and 'Soul Food.' Chris Thomas King was excellent as Lowell Fulsom, a very different blues man than the one he portrayed in 'O Brother Where Art Thou?', though Larenz Tate does a bland Quincy Jones. I listened to Charles's funeral broadcast over NPR and it was touching that the film showed us how long those who gave eulogies had been a significant part of his life. The genesis of some songs are shown a bit hokily--particularly when the credits show that they weren't written by Charles, such as 'Hit the Road, Jack' done as relationship dialogue, but they are fun and the audience can't help but knowingly respond. The film does slow down into pedestrian bio pic mode towards the end. While the build-up of the increasing dominance of Charles's personal problems with drugs and infidelity is shown realistically and effectively, his rehab is done as the usual movie cliché, with his consequent successes quickly shown in headlines across the screen. A nice touch is showing his initial reluctance to be concerned with the civil rights movement, capped by a cameo by Julian Bond.The audience I was in was racially mixed, and there were visceral, out loud responses to his life and music, like a gospel congregation.",Null,1,3,2 November 2004
Bring It On," Cheerful Teen Satire
","My older son recommended I see 'Bring It On.' His critical view, given that he was probably dragged there by his girlfriend, was that it wasn't as good a teen satire as 'Election' or 'Clueless' but was better than the usual teen movies. I'd rate it with the WB's 'Popular' series, combining satire and some social consciousness (including fair racial commentary on rhythm and class) and funny one-liners. I particularly enjoyed the cheerfully indulgent references to other teen faves, such as the opening which is clearly a funny commentary on 'American Beauty,' the references to 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' as this movie co-stars the actress who plays 'Faith' on the series. I'm not sure the teens would get the 'Risky Business' tribute or the imitation of a key 'My So-Called Life' scene.As a dentist's daughter, I thought the teeth brushing flirtation will definitely encourage more teenagers to brush at night before they go to bed (not sure though if they will be alone or together).The closing credits with salacious cheers and out-takes where the actors break character into their real ages' behavior continues the cheerful humor. The theater was quite full, even several weeks after opening.(originally written 9/24/2000)",7,0,0,12 December 2005
Lord of War," A Serious Topic Gets a Very Dark Comedy Treatment
","'Lord of War' is a very black comedy that turns quite serious. It deals effectively with issues that 'The Interpreter' botched because this uses real place names in real conflicts with no trussed up sympathies for white victims, assisted by vivid location shooting from Brooklyn's Brighton Beach to South Africa.Nicholas Cage is another 'Gordon Gekko' as a Ukrainian immigrant who finds a knack for using his gifted entrepreneurial skills to achieve the American Dream, but as a quick-witted, film flam gun dealer very like the dapper drug dealer in the comparably stylish 'Layer Cake.' In an arch narration, Cage's 'Yuri Orlov' shrugs that his business is no morally different than a tobacco or car salesman. With its eye on international affairs, the film doesn't touch on second amendment issues of the U.S. gun market or on what goes around comes around in terms of terrorism, except that he blithely notes that he didn't sell to Osama bin Laden because his checks bounced. The film is full of dark and absurdist humor, from the opening description of how his family faked being Jews in order to get out of the U.S.S.R. to what happens to an abandoned airplane on the African plain.Seen through the prism of 'Yuri's burgeoning career and family, the film is particularly good at tracking the impact of the end of the Cold War and the small conflicts around the world that have emerged as an export business from the resulting surplus ordnance, especially those between various liberation fronts that have found their horrific full flowering in Africa. I think this is the first feature film to show the sickening impact of the boy soldiers and blood diamonds of Sierra Leone, while it is equally filled with grim ironies about African realities and contradictions of living in a daily war zone. Ethan Hawke, as his 'Inspector Javert' type nemesis, gets stuck with the clunky idealistic dialog, making obvious what we can already see are the consequences of 'Yuri's actions, even as we are entertained by his flamboyant, Milo Minderbinder type tricks to outwit the law. The ending is appropriately cynical and probably realistic.Jared Leto, who is much more than his beautiful blue eyes, again movingly embodies a troubled soul, as in 'Requiem for a Dream.' He and Cage establish a warm chemistry that makes their brotherly trust palpable.Eamonn Walker of 'Oz' is not over the top as a corrupt Liberian power monger, given the horrors that have been perpetrated there. Bridget Moynahan gets to poke fun at her own talents, as she plays a model turned wooden actress who is content on her husband's worshipful pedestal until she slowly wakes up from the fantasy. Writer/director Andrew Niccol's whooshing camera angles get a bit gimmicky as they reinforce 'Yuri's sales pitches, but they are chilling in showing the enormity of the business and how that volume gets used one on one. It is also a visually exciting way to keep our attention on a serious topic instead of preaching at us, which is reserved for informational text before the credits.The choice of '80's songs into African and other world music helps to create the appropriate ambiance, though I presume they couldn't get the rights to Dylan's 'Masters of War' and Warren Zevon's 'Lawyers, Guns and Money.'",8,0,5,23 September 2005
The Iron Giant," Terrific Animated Take on 1950's Sci Fi
","Unlike most folks I know I really like Pete Townsend's 'Iron Giant' album. It inspired me to get the Ted Hughes' book and read it to my kids, who really liked it. The animation in the movie is terrific (except for the faces, which are distractingly bland, especially the kid). There was clearly a dig at Disney by opening with an ocean storm as most Disney animation starts with that (i.e. 'Little Mermaid' and 'Tarzan,' etc.) or maybe animators just like doing storms. This is done very much like 'Day the Earth Stood Still,' a throw-back to old '50's sci fi films with a dash of 'The X Files,' including a satire of Fox Mulder's character. There's references kids won't get, like the 'Duck and Cover' cartoons, Sputnik and general Cold War paranoia, which I remember quite well.Nice that there's actually some sympathetic adults in this, especially the sculptor/junk yard dealer where the Giant hangs out.But I did miss Townsend's music, even if they bought him off with a producer credit.(originally written 8/22/1999)",8,1,2,12 December 2005
Shrek," Rollicking Family Entertainment
","'Shrek' is even better rollicking family animation fun than 'Chicken Run' released earlier in the year.I loved not only the satirical references to Disney movies, but to Disneyland itself, as well as to other classic movies like 'Wizard of Oz,' all sly jokes to entertain the adults on top of the jokes the kids will get. Did the plot point of an evil chief of state banishing the fairy tale creatures have to do with Disney no longer using fairy tales as animation inspiration? The voice overs are terrific, Mike Myers with a Scottish burr, John Lithgow as a delicious villain (even if the short stature jokes run counter to the love people despite how they look theme), and especially Eddie Murphy who even tops his sidekick role in 'Mulan' for his jackass here.Perhaps this was another dig at Disney, but there was no original music, instead clever covers, including a surprising use of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' as done by John Cale, originally from the Leonard Cohen tribute album 'I'm Your Fan' (though it's Rufus Wainwright on the soundtrack CD), and the Proclaimers as a Scottish touch (though not '500 Miles' oddly enough though it would have fit the particular scene better). The finale cover of 'I'm a Believer' practically drove me out to the record store to pick up the CD, which I did a week later. I even stayed for a second showing to see the finale again, as my son had recommended seeing it twice.(originally written 6/15/2001)",10,1,3,12 December 2005
Any Given Sunday," Professional Football Meets Its Match in Oliver Stone
","I thought what a great combo for 'Any Given Sunday' - Oliver Stone and professional football -- excess meets its match. So I grabbed a chance to go to the movies with my sons. They got a lot more out of the first and third thirds of the movie that are football games, which I couldn't follow at all, knowing zilch about football so I missed any references to significances of plays and strategies and didn't recognize the zillion football players past and present in bit parts, but I got other visual and music references they didn't.The football field is explicitly a jungle, with the sounds like an elephant herd crashing. Of course Stone never says or shows once what he can get across 5 times, so the jungle fever point of the primalness of sports as a venue for male violence is accompanied by Native American chants, aboriginal and Asian Indian mystic strains as well. I don't know enough about rap to judge those selections -- I could tell there were lots of lyrics about 'niggaz' working for The Man type of thing. The second third should have appealed to me as that's when the huge ensemble has personal interactions and we learn all their selfish, dastardly, unpleasant motivations, but I was on sensory overload. Example: Al Pacino as the Old Guard Coach calls in Jamie Foxx as the suddenly first string quarterback (in a terrific performance), for a tête a tête on the pro's of Jazz over Rap, as a metaphor of the old football of finesse (what? all those flashbacks to black & white football games were of a subtle sport?). But when Foxx walks in Pacino has 'Ben Hur' playing on a wide-screen TV. As if we didn't get the point Foxx actually says 'The old gladiators, huh?' If we still didn't get the point the conversation keeps intercutting with the chariot race. And if we still didn't get the point of any reference in the conversation to racial issues then intercuts to the galley slave scenes from 'Ben Hur' THEN on top of that, the NFL commissioner who puts the Bitch Owner in her place for trying to play with the Big Old Guys is none other than Charlton Heston.No one just has a conversation -- everyone shouts, usually at the same time, so I had to close my eyes and I'm not sure if I missed something.This is Sunbelt Football of expansion teams where the sport is not a Fall/Winter season - so the women were everywhere in tank tops, cleavage, midriffs bare and hips swinging, even Cameron Diaz as the Bitch Owner. Though all the women are really high priced prostitutes (even usually sweet Lauren Holly is a hardened cold Football Wife).What I don't think I missed was Stone's outsize determination to ignore the homo-erotic aspects of male sports violence that 'Fight Club' reveled in. Aw come on Stone, not a single gay player in the closet? He crowds the behemoths into locker rooms and showers that can barely contain their bodies--but he's so afraid of showing them in contact that he even at one point has one throw a baby alligator into the shower so they scatter.Everyone is criticized-- including the sportscasters, which Stone revels in playing one (I think in general this movie is a show down between Stone and Spike Lee as it takes on more racial issues than he's done in the past). What a coincidence that ESPN is continually bad-mouthed when there's a big legible credit at the end to Turner Sports Network when this is a Time Warner movie and ESPN's a competitor.Stone of course goes out of his way to link football with war, to fit into his oeuvre, with battle quotes from Vince Lombardi and some sort of link with Pacino's father dying in WWII that was irrelevant it seemed to me. I think this is Dennis Quaid's at least third football movie and in the genre of such movies as 'North Dallas 40,' 'Longest Yard,' 'Great American Hero,' etc. and this joins that pantheon as a terrific football movie. The music selections were by Robbie Robertson (with Paul Kelly but I'm not sure which Kelly that is) and he did as seamless a job as he's done for Martin Scorcese. The music credits at the end were impossible to read -- in 3 columns of a vertical font that was like watching the credits on TV - plus the movie continues under the credits so all those who bolted missed the ending.Professional football deserves to be Oliver Stoned. But if I never saw any more football that'll be fine with me. (originally written 12/27/1999)",7,22,33,21 December 2005
Signs," Boring Homage to Old Invasion Movies
","I was about the last one in the country to go to see 'Signs' so I guess that's why the only other people in the audience kept talking through it. The first two-thirds is a cinematographically lovely homage, practically frame by frame and certainly scene by scene, to Hitchcock's 'The Birds,' in making the quotidian scary. Though instead of one hunk, we get two in Mel Gibson and Jacquin Phoenix, and no statuesque blonde.The last third steals mightily from every 1950's alien invasion sci fi movie, and some of those are classic favorites of mine. Maybe Shyamalan figures no one watches black and white movies anymore or maybe it's just more homage.Either way, I was bored.(originally written 9/29/2002)",3,7,13,13 December 2005
Sweet and Lowdown," An Uneven Defense of the Artist as Difficult Person
","As a portrait of an artist, 'Sweet and Lowdown' felt like two movies, a biography of a fictional musician and a psycho-biography of Woody Allen. The fictional part is lovely to look at (though with all the translators listed for the Chinese cinematographer it must have been a complicated shoot).The pacing does get tiring - vignette, talking head like in Reds, vignette, talking head, with no particular plot or curiosity point to propel one to keep watching.The music is wonderful to listen to, the originals seamlessly fitting in with the covers, almost too lulling, as it started working like a lullaby on me.So maybe I missed the point of the ending when the musician stops creating. Unless this is where the fictional and nonfictional come together. It's been made clear that the artist is a horror in his personal life (where the female options are a silent madonna (a wonderful Samantha Morton) and a slut who doesn't shut up (a miscast Uma Thurman though she wears the costumes well). So when everyone leaves him because they won't tolerate him any more then he can't create anymore, so that's why the Woodman's personal idiosyncrasies need to be catered to.(originally written 1/16/2000)",7,1,3,19 December 2005
Identity," ClichÃ©s Can Still Be Spooky Fun
","'Identity' not only plays on stereotypes, it considers them classic references -- the dark and stormy night setting at a run-down desert motel with a snarky manager, strangers with secrets gathering, and so on -- that let you in on the jokes and twists for an entertaining pretzel. I hope the DVD will have footnotes for all the intentional movie references, from 'Psycho,', to 'Three Faces of Eve,' '10 Little Indians,' and even 'Sunset Boulevard,' etc.I'm sure others guessed the ending, but I kept being distracted enough to not think that far ahead. This could just have easily been a cable TV movie or PBS 'Mystery' episode, but the 'A' list cast, including John Cusack and Ray Liotta, classes the joint up. I assume Amanda Peet appreciated finally being able to keep her blouse on in a movie, even if she is playing a prostitute.Good production design for that seedy motel and the music doesn't interfere.This will make a nice spooky video rental when you're in the mood.",Null,1,2,10 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Mutant Family Relationships vs Special Effects
","I'll call it 'X Men 2: X Men United,' but I don't remember seeing the subtitle in the credits; I more remember the key letter in Fox network constantly turning into 'X Men' during the barrage of ads on the TV.
Turns out I should have re-viewed the prequel 'X Men' because this picks up exactly where the last one left off and there's many references to previous happenings (hmm, what was that about those scars?) -- but then I was the oldest person at the morning showing.Director/story writer Bryan Singer has learned the lesson of successful comic book/super heroes' movies that it's the relationships stupid, though the kids in the audience do get restless during the scenes and dialogue that appealed to me (like the mutants looking longingly at warm family photographs with one who is about to 'come out' to his parents) more than the predictable special effects (after all, what were we supposed to think would happen to a super secret hideaway built under a huge concrete dam?).
There are a lot of good actors slumming here (Brian Cox's and Hugh Jackman's accents slip at the start but get stronger), giving the sidelong glances, sexual temptations, and repartee more gravitas than they were written with. Jackman also committed a lot of time to a trainer and nutritionist to develop that non-CGI body that fills the screen quite charismatically -- and aids the joke when he sardonically explains his teaching role at the school for the gifted.While the women get crucial plot points, the actresses don't have a lot to do; not much Famke Janssen can do with her telekinetic Phoenix power but scowl or Halle Berry cloud over her eyes as the weather gets Storm-ized. I'm sure these women would have had more ideas about mutant foreplay to respond to the ongoing guy-to-guy running query to Iceman on how he and Rogue (of the lifeforce squeezing power) manage their budding romance than 'We're working on it.'Alan Cummings leaving everyone in the blue dust of his teleporting mutant is fun and cool (and I enjoyed his repetition of his origins that reminded me of a running gag in 'Due South.' )I did find a couple of plot points confusing, but could connect my own dots.

Amélie," Overly Sweet Confection of True Love Will Find A Way
","'Amelie (Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain)' is a sweet confection of magic romantic realism. The adorable special effects help the time go by. Yeah the lead actress is a pert gamine, but her blank black eyes started to look like a 'Star Trek' alien to me after awhile.The ways found to keep the two meant-for-each-other lovers apart longer are cute. This shows that the French can do 'Chocolat' and 'Serendipity' better than Hollywood, which I don't really think is saying a lot. But they still can't bring themselves to do subtitles in yellow so we could actually read them through all the scenes. (originally written 11/24/01)",5,1,5,6 December 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Thrilling, Gripping, Visually Exciting Conclusion to the Trilogy
","'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' is a terrific demonstration of CGI and special effects made to serve a thrilling story of good vs. evil.I came in fully expecting that the 'Return of the King' aspect would be the story line that would draw me in the most, but found that was given short shrift with a lot of that left out from the book, given over more to cinemascope-worthy battles that are the best since the early 'Star Wars' movies. If I hadn't read the book recently, let alone re-read the appendices several times to be sure I was getting the prophesies and genealogy straight, I would never have figured out what was going on with Aragorn as the heir to Isildur, as much of what he does to convince doubters is missing. I also was a bit disappointed in Viggo not quite living up to 'LOTR: The Two Towers,' but I don't know if it was his acting or the dialog, especially in his 'rally the troops' a.k.a. 'another Crispin's Day speech,' or if I found his traveling down the Paths of the Dead less frightening, and less motivated, than in the book. His Elvish-language song at the coronation was a nice touch.Second to the battles, the lighting of the bonfires along the mountain tops was both gorgeous and exciting.I am relieved that Eowyn and Faramir's romance shows will show up in the DVD because the sudden appearance of Arwen with an approving father in Minas Tirith is simply a befuddled resolution to the triangular tensions. I am sympathetic, however, about having to leave some things out in a rushed conclusion due to the length as I did have trouble sitting through to the credits, what with the extensive previews tacked on as well.But the Gollum/Smeagol vs. Frodo and Sam competition was instead the more gripping, perhaps because the power of evil is so intensely represented by the close-up interior and exterior struggles of these almost-four characters trekking to Mordor.I didn't mind the multiple endings that others have complained of as I respected the loyalty to the source material.Howard Shore's music was martial without being bombastic, and Annie Lennox's vocalization fit in surprisingly in the over-the-credits song.(originally written 12/28/2003)",10,2,4,19 December 2005
Munich," A Literate, Intelligent, Emotional Thriller About Morality Amidst Political Murder
","'Munich' is the first time that Steven Spielberg has combined all his story telling talents to serve a literate script. It certainly seems as if Eric Roth's early draft outlined the basic plot while surely it was Tony Kushner, in his first for-hire screenplay, who added in the extensive Yiddishkeit, Talmudic discussions and moral angst. The dialog also refers to the meaning of 'home' and the Middle East, as he did in his recent play 'Homebody/Kabul' (let alone, of course, 'E.T.'). The film follows virtually the same themes and emotional trajectory as the recent Israeli completely fictional 'Walk on Water.' In both films, the sins and merits of the parents are passed on as responsibilities to the next generation that we know will lead to the nihilism of suicide bombers.The opening montages of the playing out of the 1972 Olympic hijacking smoothly edits together real broadcasts with recreated perspectives from around the world as sportscasters were drawn into horrific breaking news. The hair, clothes and production design, and particularly the evocative pop music including multilingual covers of American hits, seamlessly consistently maintain the period. These images are a continuing almost dream-like leit motif throughout the film as the story plays out, so that all sides know why they fight yet literally starts blurring their moral differences. Ironically, these images reinforce why terrorism is successful at drawing the world's attention while generating its own continuing cycle of revenge. With different characters schematically representing different points of view and philosophies, the motley-accented international cast creates mostly individual people, from the Israeli government apparatchiks to the gathering of the diverse Jewish team of incongruous action heroes to glimpses of other terrorists, and they spend a lot of time having midrashic debates over home-cooked meals.The film is anchored by a brilliant Eric Bana as 'Avner' who wrenchingly goes, Jack Ryan-like, from an intelligence analyst to active field agent, but then more -- to personal revenger to anguished post-traumatic-stress syndromed paranoid with haunted eyes. (It is a shame that he's not getting remembered at award time, but it has been a great year for lead actors.) I enjoyed the irony of his character posing as a German, particularly to gain access to ideologues who help the Baader-Meinhof Gang, with Germany serving as a locus for international terrorist planning, whether Basques' E.T.A. or I.R.A. etc., then as it did with the 9/11 plotters (and portended further at the end with the view of the pre-9/11 NYC skyline).The formation of the team is freighted with other ironies as well - Daniel Craig with his accent, body language and voice creates another unique character in his career as a steely, unreflective South African who is solidly single-minded in his goal: 'Don't f*ck with the Jews!' and can just as easily pretend to be an ANC supporter. Mathieu Kassovitz is marvelously nervous as a toy maker turned bomb maker, and Hanns Zischler is very old world fastidious as an art dealer turned documents forger and team accountant regularly toting up the cost of each kill. Ciarán Hinds disappears into his ruthlessly efficient, gray Mossad bureaucrat, recalling Alec Guinness as George Smiley in another intelligence service in a Cold War with questions (and there's also close-up shot of an umbrella in London that recalls an infamous assassination from that period).A lot of the film's tension is caught up with their efforts to avoid collateral damage, which, symbolically, gets harder and harder for them to do. It is a bit heavy-handed but very effective for the emotional core of the film that those who feel guilty become the most vulnerable.Too much in service to the themes and less to credibility are the mercenary information merchants. Ironically, Mathieu Amalric is usually cast in French films as a Woody Allen type, such as in 'Kings and Queen (Rois et reine),' while Michael Lonsdale, a la his role in 'Ronin,' as the patriarch of this amoral family business perfectly embodies the European intellectual sang-froid of anarchists with principles available to the highest bidder of the moment, like the information equivalent of Nicolas Cage's gun seller in 'Lord of War,' that is the detritus of colonialism. But it's as if they are the sole confidential informant in a cop movie, let alone ones who rent the same safe house to opposing terrorists at the same time, for an interlude that simplistically allows for presentation of the PLO's unambiguous position. There's lots of amusing references to hiding behind American dollars, but at that time there would have been plenty of Arab petrodollars available for similar nefarious ends. There's also a Mata Hari side story that goes a bit over the top visually, James Bond-style. This is definitely a hard-R film.Very unusual for a Spielberg film are the strong, physically dynamic women and 'Avner's emotional ties to them, from a baby to the tiny grandmotherly Iron Lady Golda Meir. Noted Israeli actresses play 'Avner's mother and wife: Gila Almagor both provides the inevitable Holocaust resonance and sounds like a Biblical Hannah in telling of her prayers for a son, and Ayelet Zorer, who was also so moving in 'Nina's Tragedies (Ha-Asonot Shel Nina)' is not the usual wifely appendage but an essential, beautifully sensuous grounding for her tormented husband in mature scenes that are unlike any previous Spielberg film (finally contradicting the 'Dawson's Creek' critique that there's no sex or romance in his films). But it's an unnecessary production design repetitive element to have the mother's apartment oddly filled with menorahs.These nuclear family relationships intelligently link 'Munich' to 'A History of Violence' as a reflective, geo-political counterpart.The tight editing of Janusz Kaminski's beautiful and varied cinematography (dark Graham Greene-murky Europe vs. the blinding light of Mediterranean machine guns-and-bikinis Israel) is a continuing subtext in service to what is being said.John Williams' score is uncharacteristically subdued and is in service to the tension in each scene.",10,6,12,10 January 2006

","To try and stay awake during 'Hart's War' I tried to keep track of the number of movies, TV shows and books that it borrowed from, but I lost the battle. There went 'A Soldier's Story,' and here comes Dickens's 'A Tale of Two Cities,' and every WWII movie in the Pacific Theater that has the Japanese commandant say 'You are surprised I speak your language. USC 1938.' This grafts together at least four different military movies--battles, tortures, POWs, 'You can't handle the truth!' court martials -- so there were a lot of clichés they could draw on. This is a male version of 'Charlotte Gray' for a contemporary, uncredible approach to WWII. I went to see it to monitor Colin Farrell's career whose debut in another military movie, 'Tigerland' was electrifying, and I liked director Gregory Hoblitt's TV work. But Farrell as a Yale Law School student in 1944 was about as believable as Bruce Willis as a fourth generation West Pointer. I kept wondering how they keep their hair so neatly trimmed in the POW camp. Terrence Howard comes out the best in integrating the story of the Tuskegee Airmen into the stalag part of the movie, though wasn't there a black soldier in 'Hogan's Heroes'? The German commandant, played by Rumanian actor Marcel Iures, was also non-stereotypical.Rachel Portman's swelling music is really intrusive to any suspense.The theater was virtually empty and I don't think it was due to the plot-revealing ads, as the director claims.(originally written 3/3/2002)",3,5,7,22 December 2005
Tarzan," Fun Animation, Character Voices and Music
","I loved 'Tarzan'! I was afraid that Disney would cheap out on the romance but there was enough in it for me.I liked the Phil Collins drums, but wasn't crazy about his voice throughout the whole film (nor were the restless toddlers in the audience), rather than character voices singing.The animation was wonderful,incorporating computers and gels.The elephant was too much like Horton Hears A Who, but Rosie O'Donnell's voicing of the ape friend was wonderful.(originally written 7/12/1999)",10,21,31,21 December 2005
The Thin Red Line," A Beautiful Philosophical Meditation on War Damage
","My husband, who watches the War Channels constantly, hated 'Thin Red Line' because it was certainly not a conventional war movie. I think it should be compared to Kurasawa's epic films. I let myself float with it. Certainly WWII is used as an excuse to meditate on war in general, from a post-Vietnam perspective. I did have to ask my husband for some particulars on Guadacanal and he noted some things that were correct in the movie (the unpreparedness of the military who just threw 1000s of recruits into battle slaughter) and inaccuracies (at one point a key character defends his men because he's been in battle with them for 2 1/2 years - my husband chortled that no American served in WWII that long at the point when the movie takes place, certainly not in the Pacific, as they served from Pearl Harbor to V-J day, from '44 to '45. He just meant that at the time the sergeant was speaking in the film he couldn't have served for 2 1/2 years with those men in the Pacific theater because that battle started in 8/42, 9 months after the war started and the movie seems to take place at the beginning of the battle. Guadacanal ended 2/43, which still wouldn't be 2 1/2 years).But this was the first war movie that makes the visual case of war as anti-environmental. John Toll's cinematography is staggering beautiful. This is not a movie to rent on video but to see in a wide screen theater. Famous hunky actors come and go in visual and auditory cameos, much like they did in 'The Longest Day'; clearly all the Best Young Actors were dying to play soldier, but they are so dirty it's sometimes hard to tell them apart--but that's like war too. (Hey wasn't that John Cusack? Whoa, it was him! Hey isn't that John Savage sort of replaying his character from 'Deer Hunter'? Yeah it was.)The romantic memories are some of the most beautiful romantic visuals I've ever seen in the movies, but then all the images are breathtaking, but that makes the realization that war destroys love too all the more shocking.If 'Saving Private Ryan,' which used every war movie cliché of the past 50 years, was about realism in war movies, 'Thin Red Line' is about the philosophy of war (with a few anthropological clichés thrown in).(originally written 1/24/1999)",10,0,1,21 December 2005
Sin City," Film Noir Re-Invented in a Dazzling Fictional World
","'Sin City' is a sizzling tribute to the impact of 1930's noir fiction on popular culture imagery.So it was amusing that my husband and I were more than twice the age of the other audience members and we were enjoying laughing out loud to the satirical references that none of them seemed to get.I hope all the attention to the violence won't keep away other people who are old enough to remember the roots of graphic novels in the hard-boiled detective in a corrupt city book and movie genre, as the film is actually much less gory than 'Kill Bill' and such action films as 'Assault on Precinct 13' and has a lot in common with 'L.A. Confidential.' While the crimes that are described or committed are macabrely heinous, descending from the progenitor noir 'M,' we actually don't see them directly, as the camera either pulls away or we see them in silhouette or after. So it is the power of your imagination that turns your stomach.Imagination is set free in a highly stylized, mostly black and white universe beget by 'Metropolis' and much more effectively realized here than any of the 'Batman' movies, as color, particularly blood red, only appears for emphasis.As the intersecting stories flash back and forward, we also find that some of the characters actually survive their tortures, albeit transformed physically or psychologically.Most of the actors fit into the hyper-reality of this fictional world, particularly Bruce Willis, a sinuous Jessica Alba and virtually unrecognizable Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro. The planes of Clive Owen's and Rosario Dawson's faces look great but they are having so much fun playing atypical roles that they can't keep the requisite straight faces and don't generate the necessary chemistry. Owen's Brit accent slips in occasionally (I was wondering if like Hugh Laurie's qualms in 'House, M.D.' that those sentences had a lot of R's in them) while Dawson does have to wear what must be the most uncomfortable thongs and stiletto heels.The women's position in this society and therefore in the film is of course problematical. While the only opportunities for women are as scantily clad bar maids, entertainers or prostitutes, we're supposed to respect that they have brokered empowerment among the powers that be to run their own businesses that capitalize on men's baser needs, as well as having an overly stereotyped mysterious Asian assassin as one of their own.The women are the fulcrum of the film as their exaggerated knights errant are obsessed to the death with defending them and their hard fought position in exchange for even a little artless affection from them, which raises the view of women here a smidgen above teen boys' comic book fantasies. I haven't yet looked at Frank Miller's source material to know if Alexis Bledel's character originally does call her mom a lot or if that was added for an additional pop culture reference layer to 'Gilmore Girls,' as the dialog and the images are full of such touchstones.The music is terrifically propulsive in adding to the momentum.But that is just one of the many components that multitasking Robert Rodriguez has taken care of himself to create as enveloping and more exciting a visual environment than the 'The Matrix' movies.",Null,2,7,4 April 2005
Donnie Darko," Terrific Dark Humor and Satire of A Violent Future
","Is 'Donnie Darko' the teen crazy, time traveling, prophetic, powerful, or helpless, suicidal or murderous? The dark humor and satire of 'American Beauty' meets the adolescent traumas of 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' meets the alternative universes of 'Happy Accidents' in a suburbia of hypocrisy and eccentrics, conformity and dysfunction, with a pervasive undercurrent of violence. Executive produced by Drew Barrymore, it has a terrific cast with the bigger names like Drew and Noah Wyle in surprising and small roles.The special effects are not flashy but are very effective.The movie has been cursed in its release timing, because we just can't examine the randomness of violence victims -- let alone plane engines falling out of the sky -- the same way after 9/11. Reading the daily portraits of the victims in 'The New York Times' makes us all feel as Cassandra-like as 'Donnie' and willing to do anything to change what happened.The soundtrack is a good selection of '80's mope rock, like The Joy Division and The Cure.

Shark Tale," Both Parents and Kids Will Sleep With the Fishes
","'Shark Tale' is a mediocre cartoon. The visuals are boring and make kids restless because there is not enough interesting going on. The dialogue is lame. It is not funny. I doubt the ongoing 'Car Wash' satire would even be appreciated by the parents of the very youngsters this too long, predictable cartoon will appeal to. The voice-over actors are mostly playing on their persona from other movies, including lines from those movies. The songs are mechanically revved-up covers of golden oldies.",Null,0,2,1 October 2004
Hustle & Flow," An Entertaining Hip Hop Fantasy
","'Hustle & Flow' shows the power of ambitious arts expression among poor and working class folks that recalls 'Billy Elliott' and 'The Commitments' though crossed with 'Rize' and 'Glengarry Glen Ross' as these characters are more Mamet-ish than 'The Full Monty.' The initiating plot device of a home town success's return as a networking aim or a big audition has been done before, including in showing how a community or faux family bands together to support the aspirant, but writer/director Craig Brewer showcases some original elements, especially in the ironic conclusion.Brewer is helped enormously, beyond some of the stereotyped, if very funny, language in the script, by the heartfelt cast. The film belongs to Terrence Dashon Howard, from the opening focus on his mouth, and he is electric in conveying 'DJay's calculating and changing moods, from salesman to paternal partner to artist to enforcer.Anthony Anderson well plays a very different hard-working, a bit hen-pecked if loving husband, than his gang leader in 'The Shield' but is positively charming.Ludicrous has to play a bit more of stereotype, as a gold-toothed rapper, than his low level criminal in 'Crash,' but is quite good.While the women characters are considerably problematical as to why they are even with these guys except for being dumb or some possible abuse in their backgrounds that has led to their lack of self-esteem and/or drug addiction (including in their self-denying appearances as the black women have hair straightened or died blonde and a blonde with hair extensions) despite some occasional signs of rebellion, the actresses surmount that to create very individual people with burgeoning hopes of their own, as they hesitantly are drawn into 'DJay's fantasy, including one's role as 'principal investor.' The cooperative artistic creation process is among the best scenes in the film, even if has an updated Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland 'Let's put on a show!' feel.Dedicated to the late Sam Phillips, the founder of Sun Records, and co-starring legendary songwriter Isaac Hayes, the film portrays a bit of a fantasy of a cross-section of the Memphis African-American community from the '50's to the present in its diverse musical soundtrack and look, even as it finally recognizes that times have changed, from musical equipment technology and air-conditioning to showing that the cops and prison guards are also black. It is kind of wistful to think a jheri-curled, rapping pimp would have a blues station button set on his radio, consider Otis Redding his singing idol, cry at gospel in church, as the hip hop culture isn't usually so old school, not to mention the odd boast that hip hop originated in the South, especially as the final catchy product sounds like last year's summer, Bronx-created hit 'Lean Back,' even if the language still won't get it radio play. Memphis, though, is so evocative of music, that almost every shot recalls its history, like the bridge that overlooks where Jeff Buckley drowned. Without quoting Langston Hughes, certainly all these characters are haunted by the theme of 'What happens to a dream deferred?' even if hip hop culture isn't quite the Harlem Renaissance.",7,2,5,25 July 2005
Cinderella Man," A Heart and Head Pounding Cheer for the Good Guy
","'Cinderella Man' is a shameless, old-fashioned sentimental bio-pic. And it works. As one character says 'It ain't about pugilism.' But director Ron Howard pounds away at our emotions as much as Russell Crowe pounds his boxing opponents in the ring. Howard doesn't just push every emotional button in telling the amazing story of Jim Braddock, he milks every incident in what is just in its basic outline anyway a heart tugging story of the fall and rise of a decent dad battling the Great Depression. And, through frequent tears, it works. Despite serious flaws, it works because of the central acting and the period recreation. Once again Crowe completely transforms himself for a role, not only unsurprisingly physically for the boxing rounds, as he spends a good part of the movie in nothing but trunks, and with a hard-scrabbled Joisey accent, but as a devoted, romantic family man. Crowe certainly sets a new standard of portraying masculinity on the screen as equally about being a devoted and responsible husband and father even while engaging in the most physical of occupations. The closest we've seen him reveal the other side was briefly in 'The Insider,' but we've never seen him play such an unassuming good guy, such that scenes when Braddock has to put aside his masculine pride to provide for his family are staggeringly moving. His frequent gentle giant interaction with the wonderfully natural young children, in particular, are almost too sweetly touching. He is so captivating that you can see most of the actors in one-on-one with him rise to his level. Paul Giamatti as his manager matches him in duets as they ping pong concentration and humor. Renée Zellweger with a wandering Jersey accent, though, doesn't have much to do in her passive loyal wife scenes with him and is actually stronger when she gets to flex some separate personality or where briefly there's some flare of conflict with her husband. Crowe's intensity envelops both of them, as we see her melt more beautifully here than we've seen her on film in years. Surrounding Crowe like a Daumier tableau are marvelous character actors whose faces seem to be out of the gritty boxing game classic 'Body and Soul.'It is like two films. One is a sweet Father Courage tale bathed in beautifully golden brown chiaroscuro by cinematographer Salvatore Totino that makes you feel you are looking at tinted photographs from the 1930's, complimented by marvelous costumes from individuals to the crowd scenes. But then he equally puts us directly in the ring, as brutally as he captured football in 'Any Given Sunday' and you do feel every punch, such that you involuntarily grunt out loud. Helped by the masterful editing by Howard's usual partners Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill you also get inside Braddock's state of mind in each fight, a sympathetic technique I don't recall from other boxing films, including 'Raging Bull.' Giamatti's chattering, in combination with the ring side announcers, explains the basics of the sweet science to seamlessly help you see the strategy with each competitor so they are not just repetitive slug fests but are each exciting matches. But what probably leads people to be able to criticize the Max Baer portrayal as unidimensionally villainous, which I don't think it is, is that so much of the period context is missing in the film or selectively stuck in, particularly as we haven't seen too many urban Depression movies and certainly not recently. Howard deliberately avoided the Ken Burnsian technique used so effectively in 'Seabiscuit' of editing in newsreel footage or photographs to get across the impact of the Depression. Instead we literally get one headline on a fallen newspaper. The limited exposition, unfortunately, is put in the mouth of Paddy Considine, as a fictional unemployed broker turned drunken longshoreman and sometime vaguely Socialist community organizer and his dialog and role are just confusing and clumsily inserted. While the bulk of the film takes place 1933- 1935 when the New Deal was just getting off the ground, his stilted mouthing of working class resentments and activist solutions makes Braddock's apolitical responses sound practically Republican, as Braddock, in not seeing a governmental role in either the causes or the solutions, more than once refers to the Depression as a natural phenomenon, as if the docks are the Dust Bowl (and this is the best documentation of the actual work of grappling-hook wielding longshoremen since 'On the Waterfront' as that accidentally was Braddock's training regimen). The Hooverville in Central Park where Considine somehow ends up is factual, but Mayor LaGuardia did not send in violent cops to break it up; instead the squatters were given work in WPA-type projects.There's certainly no sense of the desperate optimism attached to Roosevelt's ambitious government employment plans (including bailing out the overwhelmed state home relief offices that Braddock pridefully detests applying to) as if showing how FDR used radio as a lifeline to stir people (and my mom still enthuses how those fireside chats were inspiring) would undercut the visual images of people listening to Braddock's fights.The lack of period context is not helped by the music. While Thomas Newman's score is effective at building the tensions with each fight, particularly the throbbing percussion, it is simply odd that virtually only one period song is heard on the soundtrack, and the same cynical Eddie Cantor song is used twice, unlike the series 'Carnivale' which so effectively set the mis en scene with music, or how T. Bone Burnett could have advised, though again perhaps Howard didn't want anything else on his radio other than fight broadcasts.Despite Howard's manipulative schmaltz that almost drowns the film, it is impossible to come out without cheers and tears and pride in basic human goodness.",8,1,2,27 June 2005
Rock Star," Charming Retro Tribute to '80's Hair or Metal or Some Sort of Rock Bands
","Watch enough of VH-1's 'Behind the Music' and you can figure out the plot of 'Rock Star.'I was late so may have missed a philosophical discussion of the difference between a covers band and a tribute band (hmm, that may be worth thinking about for a few minutes). Having missed the '80's in music due to having a life, I did try to figure out if the fictional band was just a hair band, a hard rock band, a light metal band, thrash metal or what, as it's based on Judas Priest which is more metal and alienated than this.But with all those caveats, I was surprised how enjoyable the movie was, and with a fun authentic-sounding soundtrack with folks like Jason Bonham and Zakk Wylde in the fictional band (well, to me as a non-expert in whatever light metal rock genre it is with AC/DC, Bon Jovi, etc.).Mark Wahlberg is simply charming through all the hair extensions, much more like his earnest eager to please 'Boogie Nights' character than his would-be hero in 'Planet of the Apes.' Jennifer Aniston's character is surprisingly more intelligent and secure than her 'Friends' persona.The groupies here are much less benign than the Muses of 'Almost Famous,' but then this is a decade later in the travails of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. I don't think I've heard this line from a professional stripper in a VH-1 music movie: 'Hey I need to do you now cause I have to get to my job by midnight.'The production values are very high. The concert authenticity is excellent, as they filmed the scenes as opening acts to genuine metal concerts. The soundtrack is worth dancing around the kitchen and re-living '80's days I never had.

High Fidelity," The Patron Movie of Music Lovers
","High Fidelity is a laugh out loud movie for music cognoscenti.From the movie's snotty clerks (who are quite a bit like the clerks in the stores I frequent who though I give them a good chunk of my weekly pay check still look at me blankly or worse, are absolutely convinced I will not put rejects back in the right order, and sneer at my purchases until maybe twice a year do I earn some momentary approbation with an obscure selection) to John Cusack's 'Rob' reordering his CD collection (gee I have mine in alpha order, well mostly, and still my husband complains he can't find anything. Maybe he'd prefer how this character chose to sort his CDs autobiographically, as in he'd find stuff from when we shared the same taste in music) to the loving explanation of what goes into making a compilation tape (has anyone else been as hurt as I when I spend hours doing a mix tape for a friend or relative and they either just don't get it or worse never listen?)--and here the girlfriend even gets what it means. Too bad Iben Hjejle isn't otherwise convincing in her role.Critics have pointed out how unusual that this is a relationship movie from a guy's viewpoint and even more interesting that both characters do change. I of course adored Cusack before this (it was 'Say Anything' that convinced me that guys are in fact part of the human species though he didn't co-write that as he did with this though he didn't co-write of that as he did with this adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel I haven't read yet as well as pick the music) and I adore him grown-up even more.(originally written 4/19/2000)",10,0,1,19 December 2005
V for Vendetta," Feast for the Eyes More Than the Mind
","Since the almost 60 years since George Orwell's vision of '1984' we were due for an updated re-imagining of fascism and 'V for Vendetta' comes close.While it borrows far too much old-fashioned Nazi and Big Brother iconography and methodology for a paranoid future where disease has crippled the first world and chaos has brought in an ostensibly fundamentalist Christian totalitarian regime over Britain, the flashy production and sound design and snazzy editing mostly keeps us from realizing this is less about political revolution and more about personal vengeance, as if it's an addition to Chan-wook Park's trilogy ('Oldboy' etc.), which also borrowed heavily from 'The Count of Monte Cristo' or like the anti-homophobe revengeful serial killer in the TV mini-series 'Epitafios (Epitaphs)'.All of the power mongers, unfortunately, are seen more for their personal peccadilloes and homophobic theology, which makes them like hysterical updates from the Salem witch trials of 'The Crucible'. John Hurt as the big screen 'Chancellor' seems too much like the Wizard of Oz thundering away with smoke and mirrors (and ironically contradicting his rebel role in a filmed version of 'Nineteen Eighty-Four') and browbeating his underlings much like we saw Hitler in 'Downfall (Der Untergang)', though they are lit more dramatically in the dark. Scarier would have been a more insidious contemporary fear-monger, like the cynically folksy Andy Griffith in 'A Face in the Crowd'. There is amusing satire of media manipulation and a Fox News type egomaniacal, rabble rousing TV commentator watching himself adoringly in mirrors. Sinead Cusack adds needed gravity as a haunted doctor. The most intellectually captivating story angle, visually revealed through flashbacks that relieve talky explication, is a greedy 'Syriana'-like corporate conspiracy at the heart of the politics (or 'The Constant Gardener' as it's pharmaceutical companies) that is investigated by a craggily persistent Stephen Rea as an old-fashioned cop (reminding me of the career police officer who found himself a Nazi interrogator in the docu-drama 'Sophie Scholl - The Final Days (Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage)').Hugo Weaving has the difficult task of doing virtually an audiobook version of the movie, as he is masked in all but one scene, but his voice is marvelous throughout, particularly in his introductory monologue of V words. Flashy editing of his actions helps give him more expressiveness, including 'The Matrix'-like effects emblematic of writer/producers the Wachowsks. It was very effective that 'V' craftily brainwashes his minions into sacrificial fearlessness as much as the manipulative puppeteers of suicide bombers in 'Paradise Now'. His controversial climatic goal for inciting hope is actually a bit confusing in its intent and seems to confuse Kristallnacht with the bombing of the Reichstag as acts of rebellion, to continue the film's overt Nazi parallels. But 'V's own final battle brilliantly uses imagery from Ned Kelly's revolutionary stand that still spurs Australian nationalism. His and Stephen Fry's parallel collection of rescued masterpieces from 'the vaults of the Ministry of Objectionable Material' just seemed isolationistically nostalgic (complete with a constant symbolic background painting like a Renaissance Annunciation of a savior and a lot of Shakespeare quotes) and had little of the sense of comparative priorities we saw in John Frankenheimer's 'The Train ' which tensely weighed lives against the French art heritage. Natalie Portman's English accent is annoyingly, ungeographically bland and inconsistent but her visuals are so dynamic, especially with her eyes, that I was only distracted in unemotional scenes. Which is true of the whole film - that the visuals are so powerful they outweigh any thinking",8,2,5,3 April 2006
The Island," Good Looking, Bloated Patsiche of Dozens of Other Sci Fi Films
","'The Island' is a bloated pastiche of dozens of science fiction movies magnified with an enormous budget. The DVD could come with pop-up footnotes of every other movie that's referenced -- from 'Logan's Run,' to 'Brazil,' to '1984,' to 'Coma,' and even Woody Allen's 'Sleepers,' and on and on and on. With about forty-five minutes of exaggerated, laughably ridiculous chases from bad guys who can't shoot straight cut out, or else there's another twist that the lead characters are really cats with nine lives, there could have been a serviceable pedestrian futuristic thriller with visually entertaining production design, comparable to 'Imposter' and somewhat better than 'Paycheck,' though both had more substance from their Philip Dick stories than this film. It is refreshing to have a docile society broken-through first by human curiosity before it gets around, very briefly, to sex (as learned from Scarlett Johansson's Calvin Klein commercial), which somehow leads to the sudden development of a contagious moral sense of human bonds that abruptly crosses over to an effective Djimon Hounsou.Almost everything about it is confusing, from the time setting that is far enough into the 21st century for technological development and various building abandonment, but not so far away that a blizzard of contemporary product placement is still possible, as the social, economic, environmental and political structures seem pretty much the same as the present. Sometimes the plot holes that go by are quickly covered up further on with passing dialog. Humor also helps, particularly with Steve Buscemi and plays on Ewan McGregor's real life persona. But the faults of this film have to lie far more at the hands of director Michael Bay than the writers or the overwhelmed actors, whose blue screen outlines can be glimpsed. On 'The Tonight Show,' McGregor had described other filmed scenes that involved more human interaction and could yet show up on the DVD.The classical riffs in the soundtrack are borrowed to good propulsive effect to try and differentiate the endless chase scenes. While we do see where all the money went, shouldn't Bay get as much financial backlash as Cimino did for 'Heaven's Gate'?",4,1,2,18 August 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Listen to the Soundtrack and Skip the Movie
","'O Brother Where Art Thou?' features some of the best and worst tendencies of the Coen Brothers as they reexamine another movie genre. The cinematography is lush -- where 'Fargo' was visually about white, 'Miller's Crossing' visually about dark and 'Barton Fink' fascinated by the look of fire, 'O Brother' lingers over golden and amber waves of grain. 'In Fargo,' I thought the Coens had genuine love for their home turf underneath the satire and cruelty, but here we have a South of yokel myth, that makes Preston Sturges' magical 'Sullivan's Travels' --which this is close to a remake of--seem like a documentary. The Daughters of the Confederacy who walked out of 'Gone With The Wind' for showing that the South lost the War Between the States would surely walk out of this one.Like a humorous counterpoint to 'Dancer in the Dark,' this feels like a European musical's look at the South of the Great Depression, from corrupt politicians, to chain gangs, to river baptisms, to KKK rallies, road kill BBQs, and bank robberies. But it comes alive through the overpowering music selected by T-Bone Burnett that becomes the central focus of the movie (complete with a pilgrimage to a radio station as in 'American Graffiti' but with a commercial and political exploitation angle: 'Hey a man there will pay you for singing into a can!'). Few other than public radio listeners will feel disconcerted having the very distinctive voices of Allison Krauss, Emmy Lou Harris, Gillian Welch, the Fairfield 4, and Ralph Stanley come out of actors' mouths, like in 'Pennies from Heaven,' because the music is the basis for mesmerizing, highly theatrical set-pieces. It must have been at the directors' direction that John Torturro gives the worst performance of his otherwise exemplary career and Tim Blake Nelsonis worse, as their faces are frozen in Ma and Pa Kettle stereotypes. George Clooney tries a Southern accent for 30 seconds then gives up, which is ironic as he was born and raised in Kentucky. His container of Dapper Dan hair pomade becomes an ongoing leitmotif like the hat in 'Miller's Crossing' with no significance other than the visual. I did miss the opening minute or so due to strong hunger pains and a slow refreshment line, but I don't think seeing the opening quote from Homer would have changed my impression. I recommend the soundtrack rather than the video.(originally written 12/30/2000)",5,3,6,19 December 2005
