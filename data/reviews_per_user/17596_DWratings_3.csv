Despicable Me 2," Must see, adults and kids
","'Despicable Me 2' is one of those kid movies, that had the adults laughing more than the kids. This movie definitely delivers, and my kids and I had a great time at this one. The minions is what makes this movie so enjoyable, as kids will like them for them being yellow and weird looking, and the adults as they do things adults can relate to. (The song at the end is epic). Gru (Steve Carell) was great, especially his take on his daughter dating. I would highly recommend seeing this movie on the big screen. I saw it in 2D which was good for me, but I couldn't imagine 3D ruining it, like it does a lot of movies. This movie provides good family fun and is a must see 8 out of 10 stars-MUST SEE",8,1,2,8 July 2013
This Is the End," Seth Rogen at it again
","Seth Rogen and writer Evan Goldberg (who directed with Rogen) hit it again. All the actors in this movie have great chemistry with one another, which is way most of their movies together are hilarious. 'This is the end' is basically a joyride that will not let you down. Franco, Rogen, Hill, McBride, Cera and others will leave you with nonstop laughter in this comedy meets horror (Think 'Zombieland' on drugs). They're no real flaws with this movie other than the 'this will and could never happen' which is why you should just let your mind go and have some fun with this one. I give this 8 out of 10 stars - MUST OWN",8,2,6,29 June 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Started with such potential..
","First off, I have no clue why this movie is so highly regarded. I mean I'm still wondering how that got so out of hand so quickly. I'll admit, this movie started off pretty good, had my attention, had an unique story/plot going on, then out of no where I completely lost interest. It had nothing to do with the actors, as I thought they all played their roles to the best of their abilities, other than one very annoying voice. Another thing this movie had going OK was the special effects/graphics. The problem is how the movie ended. That seems to be very common now days, especially in the horror genre. Directors/writers get going and going and totally wind up off the deep end. I give this movie 4 out of 10-RENT IT",4,2,3,29 June 2013
