The Avengers," Finally got around to watching it after 5 years...
","This is one of the most overrated movies I have seen. I'm not much of a superhero fan, but I did enjoy Spiderman 1, 2, and 3 as well as Ironman. I've never seen Thor or Captain America so I know I'm missing a little backstory, but I doubt it would add a lot to the experience in this movie. The story was sub-par and very predictable. There is also no sense of danger whatsoever since these superheroes are near invincible, which is why I tend to avoid superhero movies. Action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99/100 times. I laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys. Do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats? Yes, the visuals are decent but that's not what makes a movie. When comparing this film to Guardians of the Galaxy, it's no contest. GotG had drama, humor (that wasn't forced), a decent story, and fantastic visuals. If you are a Marvel fan, you will probably like this film simply because you love the characters. I was looking for something other than mindless action and unfortunately I did not get that.",4,5,8,9 September 2017
Blade Runner 2049," A great film to put you asleep
","This film took me weeks to finish. It may be visually appealing, but that's about it. Everything goes at half speed and the story isn't interesting enough to keep you awake. Had they cut this down to a 1 hour 45 minute movie, I think it would be much better because there is just so much unnecessary filler. 'Hey, it's time to transition to the next scene, here's a 5 minute panoramic view of the scenery before we get into the dialogue.' I'm exaggerating a little bit there, but it's what it feels like throughout the entire film. I thought the original movie was ok, but I don't think it needed an almost 3 hour sequel.",4,4,7,17 June 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Watchable
","The film is more like a 6.5 but I decided to round up. Hollywood could have combined this film and the next Mockingjay (when it comes out) by adding maybe an extra 15-20 minutes in the beginning. There was so much filler in this movie, it was ridiculous. I was however, somewhat entertained throughout the movie even though there wasn't much action. It was probably the fact that the acting was decent. The one thing that will annoy you is Jennifer's whining in this movie.If you can watch it for free, you may as well (currently on Amazon Prime Video) otherwise I would not pay money to see it. You won't walk away amazed. You pretty much have to watch this in order to see the last one anyways, which is supposedly going to have lots of action (according to those who read the book). I refused to pay money so I waited so long to see this one because of the fact they split it up to make more money.",7,2,4,4 November 2015
Darkest Hour," Don't expect a history lesson
","While watching this film, I was glued to the screen. Everything from the opening title screen showing Hitler and his army, Gary Oldman's acting, the speeches, the costumes and setting... were all superb! But then after the film ends, there will be something in your brain that tells you to do some fact checking. There is one scene in particular which I guarantee that you will look up and be extremely disappointed that it never happened. Then after checking that fact, you will soon realize there are many other historical facts that were portrayed wrong in the film. I had given this film a 9/10 until I did further research. I definitely don't regret watching it, but I was hoping for a more accurate portrayal since this is a 'Biography' after all. If anything, this film will get you interested into reading more about Winston Churchill once you realize how inaccurate it is. The only reason to watch this film is for Gary Oldman's acting and the wonderful costume designs/setting.",6,3,4,4 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Thought this was Spiderman, not a PG-13 Deadpool Knockoff
","It felt like a Deadpool knockoff, except Deadpool was actually funny. What a joke they have turned Spiderman into and a huge slap in the face to fans of the original trilogy with Tobey Maguire. Tom Holland (who plays this Spiderman) is a complete joke in this film. I can't tell if it's bad acting or terrible script writing, but it just didn't work. Jacob Batalon (Spiderman's friend) was the only thing that saved this film from being a disaster. He plays his role so well and is a huge relief after dealing with Tom Holland's horrible attempt at comedy.The first thing that will strike you, is the fact that there was no backstory into how he became Spiderman. This takes a lot away from the movie. But then again, this was a comedy, not a drama so I might be wrong in that department. The next thing that will catch your eye is the terrible CGI. Spiderman bounces around the screen completely weightless. Moving on to the story, the love interest in this didn't feel real at all. Again, there was no backstory to what sparked them to start noticing each other. I also found it funny when the students started hating on Peter Parker for the dumbest of all reasons. There were so many cringe worthy moments with that as well as the love interest. The main story line with the villain and Iron Man was decent though. A few small twists here and there but mostly predictable. There is only so much you can do with a Super-Hero movie when sequels are inevitable and the actors want to play the same roles in the next movie for extra money.Overall, I'm shocked that this is listed as Action/Adventure, Sci-Fi and not listed as Comedy on IMDb. The comedy in this is horrendous with Jacob Batalon single-handily saving the movie. Maybe if you are 13, you will enjoy this movie. I had high hopes when watching this, but I found out it was gone 5 minutes after Spiderman was introduced in the film.",5,2,3,8 October 2017
Interstellar," Highly Overrated
","Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it. It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it. And just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie.",7,4,6,3 November 2015
Baby Driver," Was expecting more
","I went in this movie not knowing anything about it other than the fact that it was probably going to be a bank robbery type of movie. Now it had that, but it was simplified. The action scenes had a comedic aspect to them that just didn't feel right to me along with a lot of action happening behind closed doors. It does make sense since he is a driver and can't see what's going on, but there was one scene where the camera purposefully gets out of the way so we can't see. It really takes out the suspense in everything, which would've added a whole lot more to the movie.This movie could've been so much more had they not gone the comedic route. Unfortunately though, nothing was believable because of that. You have cops coming out of nowhere and action scenes that are unrealistic. I guess a big mistake of mine is comparing it to the movie Heat, because that's what I was expecting from what little I knew. It was still a decent movie with an interesting story, but it falls short because it resorted to comedy for the action sequences. If you go in not expecting Heat or A Dog Day Afternoon, you may enjoy it slightly more than me.",6,19,31,14 September 2017
Dunkirk," Critics must've been paid big time... Giant disappointment
","I have no idea why critics seem to enjoy this movie and I have no clue how this has an 8.5/10 (at the time of writing) on IMDb. I hope this is eventually corrected upon DVD release. This movie did have fantastic visuals and amazing sound, but I don't go to movies just for that. I need some sort of character development, which this movie offered none. The characters also looked very similar, so you tend to get confused at times. They try to get you to care if someone dies, but you just aren't attached to them so you won't care if they do die. They also talk about grand scale, but there is no grand scale here. Now, I know very little about Dunkirk, but I'm pretty sure there were hundreds of thousands of people. This film seems so small compared to that number.I get that the film maker wanted to put you at the center of the action to appreciate the grand scale, but it doesn't seem to work here. You may as well play a WWII video game instead of watching this movie. Honestly, this would've been better if it were a History Documentary instead. At least in that case, you would've learned a lot more with awesome visuals. Joking aside, I've actually never been so close to walking out halfway through a movie before. You will leave underwhelmed, or in my case, I was angry that I got duped by the critics.",5,10,16,7 August 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Review from someone who didn't read the book
","An Unexpected Journey was decent but during the Desolation of Smaug, I could notice a sharp decline in quality and things began to really drag out. The Battle of Five Armies continues that trend. The CGI that is used in the battle scenes are absolutely terrible, which I'm sure you noticed in the first two films. However, there is a battle scene that is absurdly long. There is no sense of danger whatsoever. It's almost like they are fighting on the moon, weightless. The orcs pose no threat at all! And that Azog character, what a joke! Not only does he look like a cartoon character, his role is so stupid! There's also so many new devices that the orcs use in battle that we don't see in the LOTR Trilogy... they really catered to the kids in this trilogy.The only good thing about this trilogy is that it pretty much forces you to go and watch the LOTR Trilogy again just to make up for this.",5,3,4,15 January 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Great Action, Lackluster Plot
","Positives: This movie had awesome action scenes. A bit over the top in some parts, but this is John Wick so that was expected. The location and scenery was absolutely spectacular. It also had some humor in it, more so than the first.Negatives: Lacked the emotion from the first film (won't go into detail because of spoilers). The plot line also got confusing at times. It wasn't as straight forward as the first film.Overall: Don't go in expecting a drama/action movie like the first one had. Go in expecting awesome fight scenes with a little comedy here and there.",7,2,10,10 February 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Decent story, poor execution, laughable battle scenes
","The film is split into 3 parts: The romance/backstory, boot-camp, and the actual war. The romance part was the most cheesy thing I have seen. I get that it's hard to really encapsulate romance in short amount of time, but they could of at least done a little better. Still, the buildup was decent enough to keep my attention. The second part of the movie was probably the best part. I won't spoil too much, but there was a lot going on that made it interesting. I will say that this part was a little too religious for me, but I knew that going into the movie. Now on to the actual battle part of the movie, this is honestly the worst depiction of battle I have seen. I felt like I was watching a cartoon for some reason. The actual battle map is the most ridiculous thing ever as well. One rope ladder? Are you serious? None of it was believable. It had the potential to be something, but they went for the Hollywood glorification. This is laughable compared to the battles in Saving Private Ryan. There was one scene where the main character was pulling a character on some sort of make-shift sled and the injured soldier was shooting and mowed down like 5 people. Not realistic at all. There is no emotional involvement in this film because the scenes made it so cheesy.",6,2,5,29 September 2017
