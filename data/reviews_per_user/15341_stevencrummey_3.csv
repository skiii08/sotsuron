Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie is definitely worth watching! Despite what people say!
","Ever since May 19, 1999, Older, Die-Hard Star Wars fans have bashed 'The Phantom Menace', which is the first episode of the saga. The reason why they do this is simple: No matter what George Lucas comes up with in terms of movie ideas, or no matter how good the movie is - it will never be as good as the Original Star Wars Trilogy, or A New Hope (Star Wars Episode IV). Older fans have to get over this. The original Trilogy are the Star Wars films that the older fans have come to grow up with, and I understand that seeing newer Star Wars films may disappoint them simply because of the fact that they never came out years ago when they could enjoy them to the fullest. Please, let the Star Wars fans who really understand Star Wars enjoy the movies without people saying how much they hate them simply because they will never like anything better than the original trilogy. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, but for God's sake, get over it, the Newer Trilogy is just as good as the older ones. Over all, I have to say that the Phantom Menace delivered what I expected and I enjoyed watching it for the most part. Although I wasn't to excited when I watched the Pod Race. This just prolongs the somewhat boring Tatooine part of the movie. Probably the best part of The Phantom Menace was the end, when the conflicts climax and the stage becomes set for the next five films. Although I don't think that Darth Maul should have died in the film, he wasn't in this one enough anyways, and I'm sure fans would have wanted to see him again in Attack of the Clones.The internal conflict is created nicely in Anakin Skywalker when he is freed from slavery. We see how he doesn't want things to change, in spite of his limited power to stop the change. His fear for loosing his mother is what surfaces Anakin's evil in this movie, and foreshadows events to come in the next movie (Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones). Thnaks George for the wonderful, action packed exciting film. It was what I expected. -Steven Crummey, 16",9,1,2,1 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Solid Continuation
","OK, I have to say this - In all of my movie reviews on this site, I'm expressing my opinion, which I am entitled to. These reviews are my opinion only, and nothing else. So let's dig in, shall we? This movie was a solid follow up from TPM. It contained (1) the beginning of the clone wars (Who didn't want to see that?!), (2) it also contained an older, more whiny, evil Anakin. Along with that, (3) we got so see where the Stormtroopers originated along with (4) Boba Fett. Okay, so this movie sounds pretty darn good just by reading that paragraph!(1) THE BEGINNING OF THE CLONE WARS - I'll never forget sitting in the theater in the summer of 2002 and watching the clone wars unfold on the big screen. I don't think I blinked through the whole thing. I thought that the special effects were amazing. To see those giant tanks get blown up and hearing the surround sound of the sequence. It was truly a wonderful, exciting experience. I'm my opinion, the 'Clone Wars' from Episode II was probably one of the greatest moments in the Star Wars saga (Not the greatest, tho). And to see all the battle droids, destroyer droids, and super battle droids, along with all the Jedi, and the Clone Troopers battle against each other was simply the best. The animators must of spent the better part of a year making this sequence. I thought that the 'Clone Wars' delivered big-time, and was one of the reasons that made AOTC the great film it is. (2)ANAKIN - Okay, I'll admit, Anakin could have been better in the film. But I still think that Hayden did a great job. I don't think that the reason people hated Anakin was because of Hayden's performance, rather because they were expecting to see an Anakin who didn't care about anything, and wanted to destroy everything in his path. But this is not how George wanted Anakin to be. How on earth could he fall in love with Padme in AOTC if he was evil? Anakin was supposed to be the whiny little brat he is in Episode II. That is how he really became evil. He never woke up one morning and decided 'Hey, I think I'll become Darth Vader today and kill everything I see!'. This was how George wanted Hayden to act the part of Anakin. Anakin was supposed to be whiny. And I agree with it. Anakin had to have feeling and emotional stress in Episode II, that is what the whole saga is about. It is about how Anakin tragically turned to the dark side through his confusion of love and loyalty. It is not about how Anakin 'woke up one morning and decided to kill everything'. How would that work to create and good, solid story? It simply wouldn't. I think that Anakin;s character was great in Episode II, but never the less, he could have been better in terms of his tacky, and cheesy lines. I think that the 'I wish that I could just wish away all my feelings' line was the worst line in the whole Star Wars saga. (3) ORIGINATION OF THE STORMTROOPERS - I thought that the Clone Troopers were done nicely in this movie. But I didn't like the fact that not one single Clone Trooper costume was created for an actor in the movie. All the clones in this movie was created digitally, and I thought that it never put any feeling in the clones. But I did love the back story of the clones, and it was certainly nice to see the our beloved Stormtroopers originated. Although not all the Stormtroopers in the original trilogy are clone. It says on the Star Wars official website in the data-bank that after the formation of the Empire, recruits were make for stormtroopers along with clones. (4)THE BOBA FETT THING - So Boba's daddy was the person that the Clone Troopers were cloned after eh? And this was all part of George's grand vision that he had back in the 70's and 80's eh? I don't think so. On the bonus disk of the original trilogy DVD's, good ol' George said himself that he never intended Boba Fett to become as recognizable and famous as he did, so how could Boba Fett and his father to have such a dominant role in Episode II? Anyways, all that mumble jumble aside, I think that Boba Fett was only put in Episode II for George and his team to make an extra buck, but I still enjoyed seeing more of Boba Fett. In conclusion, Episode II is probably on of my favorite Star Wars films out of all six. And I think that as time goes on, more and more fans will begin to see the film for what it is, and accept it as a classic, and a rich part of the mystical Star Wars saga.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Very Good, With Some Flaws.
","I really have to say that this movie was indeed what I expected it to be. After all, there wern't any surprises, we knew that Anakin ultimately turns to the dark side of the force, and that George Lucas would again, for the sixth time, make a mint off of his beloved Star Wars Franchise.Walking into the cinema on May 19, 2005 knowing that this would be the last Star Wars movie was really sad. I grew up with this story, and knowing that this would be the finale of the series was indeed sad. But most of all I was hoping that good old George wouldn't eff this one up. And he didn't for the most part.I think that George should have split some of the plot up tho, and put some of the events into the second one. But he never, and whats done is done. This movie takes off from the get go, which is good, but when it comes to a star wars movie, its all about the story. As soon as the movie started I never got a Chance to blink cause I thought that I might miss something everything was happening so quickly.I didn't like how quickly and effortlessly Anakin turned to the dark side. I mean after he killed mace you would think that he would realize what he did, and not become a bad ass. But I love Darth Vader, it just should have happened a better way... Come on George, just cause Sam Jackson wanted to go out with a bang doesn't mean u had to base Anakin's betrayal around it. I also didn't like at all how Padme died. What the blue hell 'she lost the will to live'. She had to kids to live for....but yet she doesn't care, if Annie isn't there nothing is worth it? Come on, that was lame.What I did like about this movie was the acting. There was, in my opinion, a lot of feeling and thought put into this flick. And it paid off, the actors seem to be 'in their zone' here and it looks really good on screen. Although Padme should have been in it more, Natalie Portman was the best actress in this movie. The end duel was excellent. But how in the hell could they find time to punch each other and kick each other around when all you could see for the most part was a blue blur? But i loved how it ended, tied everything up, and made a lot of point from the old movies fit into place. The rise of Darth Vader in then end was moving. You could tell he wanted revenge and the next three movies were easily put into place.All in all, i loved episode III. With some flaws, I think George Lucas delivered, and once again, made another excellent Star Wars movie.",10,0,3,30 May 2007
