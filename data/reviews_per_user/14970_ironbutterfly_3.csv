Catch Me If You Can," One of Spielberg's best...
","This movie, from the talented direction to the great acting is beyond terrific.  I hope Leonardo Dicaprio gets the academy award for this movie (and I never thought I would ever say that, but he is incredibly good in this movie).  Also, Tom Hanks should get best supporting actor at the oscars as well, because as always, he was great (BTW he was jipped for the oscar for castaway.  He pulled a one man show for 2 and a half hours on an island, and it still kept my interest.)  Come on academy, when will Leonardo ever get nominated for an academy award in a leading actor category again (nominated for best supporting actor for What's Eating Gilbert Grape; lost though).  Just give him this one, because he deserves it.",Null,0,0,31 December 2002
Spider-Man," Great comic book film, but a little bit on the corny side.
","I believe that Spider-Man is the best comic book movie there is, but that is half compliment and half insult.  Superman, Batman, and X-Men all suffered from the same thing; they all had a weak plot.  Superman's ending was an utter cop out.  Batman really didn't have a plot if you think about it, it was just moody. X-Men was completely rushed and Magnito's plan for mutant acceptance or whatever he wanted was stupid.  Spider-Man had a much better plot (Still don't know what Green Goblin whole plan was. He already murdered his enemies, then what)but the dialog was corny.  That whole hospital scene where Peter talks to MJ needs to go. Plus, Harry and J Jonah Jamerson should had been in it more.  I don't know why Harry and Peter were hanging out together because in the movie I could clearly see that they really didn't like each other too much, but in the comic they were two peas in a pod. Peter's character should had been more like MTV's Daria/Chandler on Friends.  He wasn't funny at all in this movie and that made Peter stand out as a character other than he being the only normal/down to earth superhero in comicbook land (Standing Ovation to Stan Lee).  Also I did not like Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane.  I would have chosen Eliza Cuthbert from 24 or Sarah Michelle Gellar, but they seemed more of Gwen Stacy candidates than Mary Jane.  I had read the book version of the Spider-Man movie, and it is 10 times better than the actual movie, and it is based off of it. 
  The 9/11 stuff had to go as well.  I know it happened.  America knows it happened, so I don't need to be reminded of it in a super hero movie.  That was an extremely BAD mistake and it brought down the whole movie.
   The music on further note was awful.  I have bad expectations for the Daredevil movie, but geez I heard some of the music to the soundtrack and it is 10 times better than Spider-Man's.  Danny Elfman totally failed me.  This is the person who brought us the theme to Batman and The Simpsons.  The trailer music by E.S. Posthumus should had been the theme song.   Next time get the composer from the Disney animated series 'Gargoyles' because he composed a great theme.  Theme songs are one of the best parts in a superhero movie, that is another thing why X-Men gone wrong.    Last and most is the action scenes.  I really didn't care about the CGI. People thought it look fake, but I thought it looked fine, along with the Green Goblin costume, but that, along with my review is my opinion.  They should have gotten Yuen Woo Ping and mimic 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's,' fighting moves or have 'Cirque de Soleil' choreograph the movie. It's SPIDER-MAN, the master of strings.  Who cares if people say, 'How can a teen-ager know how to do all those fighting moves.'  Just leave that question with the, 'How can a teen-ager make a foam latex superhero outfit to fight crime, he just can.'      Like I said before, this movie is the best comic book adaption, but that isn't saying much.  There were many flaws in this movie and I expected more from the person who wrote the brilliant script 'Panic Room.'  Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice to play Peter Parker.  Wes Bentley would just had made Peter look like the American Beauty role he played. The movie deserved all the money it racked in and I hope it still stays at number 1 of the highest billed movies to bring in the most money in the first weekend. Daredevil would probably suck like Tomb Raider. The movie is mostly hyped by the commercials, but when you watch it, it is awful because Mark Steven Johnson is cramming in 20 years of Daredevil comics into one movie by having so many characters in the first movie, while he could easily put half of them in the sequel that we all know is coming in 2005 of 06.  I applaud the screenwriter for not cramming all the comics into Spider-Man, but I hope he corrects some of the mistakes he did in the first one for the sequel.",10,0,0,11 December 2002
Am√©lie," Next to 'When Harry Met Sally', this is the best comedic movie I have ever seen.
","This movie is beyond great.  From the fantastic direction of Jean Pierre Jeunet to the illuminating leading lady--the beautiful Audrey Tautou (who is the next Audrey Hepburn)this movie is flawless.  It is about a shy,inquisitive,selfless young woman named Amelie Poulain.  Amelie occupies her life by making other people in her small town happy, but she is so busy making other peoples lives meaningful that she forgets about herself, and it takes an agoraphobic man with a fragile bone structure to help her believe that she too counts as a human being on this earth and deserves happiness, and the love of a lonely young man who collects torn up photos from the bottom of photo booths, to help Amelie start thinking about herself. If you buy the DVD, I would advise to read the English subtitles and turn the English dialog back to French because it spoils the whole ambiance of this magnificent tale, because the voices of the actors help bring its watcher into this movie.",Null,0,1,28 November 2002
