The Alamo," Texas history
","This film was very interesting and overall enjoyed it. I liked the part when Davy Crockett used his gun to shoot Santa Anna right above his shoulder, and when Davy Crockett played his violin when Santa Anna's army was playing the drum meaning they were about to attack. Over all i enjoyed it, it is very interesting to see how the battle of the Alamo came to be.",8,0,2,15 October 2018
