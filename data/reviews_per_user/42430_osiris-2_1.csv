The Blair Witch Project," Very good but not quite up to all the hype...
","Truly this is the scariest movie I have seen for some time.  It proves that a good horror movie doesn't need a lot of blood, guts, or special effects to be effective.  Many have ranked this movie with Psycho, but I would definitely not go that far.  While it is scary in the night scenes, the day scenes tend to drag on.  I was always anxious for it to get dark again - when all the scary things happened.  In my opinion, Psycho never dragged along.  But, regardless, I am telling everyone I know to go see it.  It will most likely be their best scare for quite some time.",8,1,1,24 July 1999
