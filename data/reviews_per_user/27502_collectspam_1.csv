Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Harshly judged by unworthy prigs. Brilliantly handled.
","This movie is just short of an entertainment masterpiece in its genre. The masterful weaving of actual recorded history and vampire-laden storytelling to recount a seriously-told but thoroughly entertaining story is truly a sight to behold.The cinematography is beautiful, seamlessly letting the viewer know when scenes are set in the relative past and present, and the action beautifully shot, well choreographed and entirely relevant to the story.A rating of below 6 out of 10 is absurd. This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, with fantastic performances from the entire cast, but especially so from Abraham himself, a (to me) completely unknown actor and thoroughly deserving leading man. While I suspect he won't become a huge Hollywood star, it is not for want of acting talent.While played seriously, the film works all the better for it. Highly recommended.",9,1,3,27 July 2013
