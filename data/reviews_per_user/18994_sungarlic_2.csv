Resident Evil: Afterlife," Just Awful. Worst action movie ever.
","I just can't understand why people give such a good reviews, because I went to the movie yesterday and I laughed out of disappointment mostly. The script is just awful. Mistakes everywhere. Zombies and ...people pop out of nowhere and everywhere. Shooting but leaving no dead corpses around. In the beginning Milla actually becomes normal human again but still survives jet explosion somehow. Peaple i beg you not to go to see this movie and support such a bad ekranization of really good game series. Do yourself a favor and try the game. The game makes a lot more sense and the plot is much better. I give this movie 1/10 because it actually worths just 1. I hate all the people who give more, because they mislead other people into buying a ticket and watching such a disaster. Peaple, get smart or die out of stupidity.",1,21,43,11 September 2010
Clash of the Titans," Sam Worthington couldn't be worse
","Sam Worthington made a shitty performance acting like pompous bastard. The whole movie was about HIM, and how great he is, and he is JUST a man and he spits on faces of gods. The whole movie was 2d no matter if you're wearing 3d glasses or not. the plot could have been good, but not with sam worthlessgton shouting lines from avatar... i.e. 'i need your help' and 'someone has to stand and say - ENOUGH'. This movie is a rip off and it deserves the worst evaluation. 1. It's obvious that director and other staff involved tried to make this movie look like avatar, but they have failed. It is NOTHING compared to Avatar, which in my opinion is great.",1,9,13,25 April 2010
