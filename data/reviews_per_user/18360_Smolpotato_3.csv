Hereditary," Disappointment
","At first, this movie seemed so promising. Debating mental health issues and how they tend to run in the family, building up a story instead of just going ahead with the scary stuff like a classical horror movie... it just seemed like this would really revolutionize the horror industry, since many 'scary' movies rely too much on jumpscares instead of trying to get under your skin. But this movie DOES get under your skin. You end up feeling sympathy for the main characters, and Milly Shapiro is just amazing and adorable (except for her thing with that bird...). I sat in the theatre, thinking that I was in for a real treat that would leave me with a lot to think about.That completely changed withing that last scene.They could have focused on the mental illnesses and how people with anxiety or schizophrenia tends to make everything worse in their heads, imagining things that will never happen. They could have gone in so many different directions, and instead they end up going with this weird cult-thing that nobody really understood? Everybody in the theater that I heard talk afterwards felt the same as I did. Vice called this the horror movie of the century, but I disagree",4,1,4,7 July 2018
Ready Player One," Masterpiece with rough edges
","This movie nearly has it all: The details of the animation are absolutely incredible, the storyline is captivating and the score is so fitting. This movie is almost perfect.Almost.There are a few things that it could have done better. Most of these things has to do with I-R0K.First of all, T.J. Miller was so miscast. They should have made his voice deeper so he would seem more terrifying. The point of I-R0K is that he's a big, scary guy, and he had everything - except for the voice and the courage. I know he's a free spirit that noone is really sure whether or not to trust, but that made him seem cowardly more that a person with no alliances. The 'battle' against him was cringeworthy. Wasn't he supposed to be tough and strong? The only reason IOI wanted him was because he knew how to activate the orb - but Art3mis could do the exact same thing, and it was apparently easy to learn. Also, couldn't they have sent a spy to take Parzival out? I-R0K could have been awesome, but instead he ended up being a pointless character. Otherwise, it's an amazing movie that I definitely recommend watching, whether you like video games or not",9,0,1,8 July 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Yeah, no
","This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I have to agree that the only reason it gets high praise is because of QT. It disrespects a tragic event, the dialogue has no meaning whatsoever, and the writing is bad. Its only redeeming qualities are the great acting (albeit with a bad script) and the fact that they used actual footage of Sharon Tate.",2,6,9,30 August 2019
