Sucker Punch," A Geek Masterpiece
","This is one of the best movies of the year so far, in my opinion. I've just seen it today, and I have to say, I was blown away. Yes, I've heard about, and actually saw some people who were so disappointed that they walked out on it, but I guess they just didn't understand what this was all about. They probably came in to watch some cool little popcorn flick with nice visuals, and got something else for their money. I'm as fond of decent popcorn flicks as the next guy, I'm not sure Sucker Punch fits the category.For this is a movie you have to pay attention to, and work it out for yourself. The plot develops on multiple levels, corresponding to different levels of psychological consciousness and/or insanity, and it is choke packed with symbols and archetypes, so much so that it is difficult to say what is the reality (in the terms of the story) behind the imaginary. Though it won't be necessary, it won't hurt either to have some superficial knowledge of psychology and mythic archetypes beforehand - for those who know what I'm talking about, think Hero's Journey.Don't get me wrong, there are some very nice visuals, the scenes are breathtaking, but if you're going in unprepared, expecting only a flick with explosions and hot chicks, you will be disappointed, for the scenes won't make any sense to you. Go in with an open and attentive mind, and reap the rewards.Sucker Punch is kind of an art movie for geeks, an amalgamation of colorful action and deep sources of meaning. But all this my opinion, of course; don't take my word on it. Go see the movie if some theatres are still playing it near you, or wait till it comes out on DVD, and make up you own mind. Granted, it's not for everybody, but my guess is if you're into geek stuff, you won't regret this one.",10,2,6,21 April 2011
