Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Roger, Roger
","Where does a piece like this come from? I just watched it again last night after about 2 years off. The little Greedo looking character says, 'Aww you're so funny Ani, he he.' How could the producers watch this without cringing? The little girl beside mini-greedo is wearing braces!!! Also, why is Yoda cross-eyed. I just watched Empire and ROTJ, Yoda was completely believable, he had so much character. In Episode I he has no character qualities at all, and you have no idea where he's looking! Also, how can they make Jabba's assistant (with the snake-deal around his neck) look nothing like the old one? Every second on Tatooine is worse than forgettable, I wouldn't mind forgettable, this is borderline offensive.Save for the two Jedi this is probably the worst acted film in the history of cinema, I have no reservations declaring it as such. It gets the 2 rating because the lightsabre battle was fantastic.",2,0,4,9 February 2005
