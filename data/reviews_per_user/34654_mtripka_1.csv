Walk the Line," THAT was Reese Witherspoon? WOW!!
","I am a longtime Witherspoon fan since 'Legally Blonde' but in this movie I forgot that was her as June Carter. I had heard that Joaquin Phoenix did his own singing as Johnny Cash--which was very good, I'm a longtime Cash fan--but I hadn't known that Witherspoon would do her own singing as Catter which was equally good, and I was watching the credits at the end thinking, 'Who WAS that?' Story did drag a little at times but was true to that part of their lives as I am familiar with it--and yes, Cash was indeed that self-destructive, and Carter was that much a part of his survival. As much as a story of rags to riches, this is a story of love and redemption.",8,2,4,28 November 2005
