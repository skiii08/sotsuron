Come and See," War personified.
","I absolutely loved Come and See. I found its new point-of-view on war a breath of fresh air. Furthermore, this film to me was more true to exactly what war causes to the psychological condition. Although perhaps director Elim Klimove did not set out to create a horrifying/scarring film about the injustices that occurred in Byelorussia. In fact, he does two great things in this film. He really makes the audience reflect of the horrors/tragedies of war as well redefine the war film genre entirely. What most affected me was the exact terror that the Nazi regime committed. As the film ends it informs us that the massacre that occurred in that village happened over 600 times just in the tiny area of Byelorussia. This made such a huge impact to me. Of course I had heard of the immense numbers of casualties of the war, but it took it happening to one small village for me to understand the atrocities. Something the director I feel achieved greatly was making the audience feel as though they were there in the battlefields with the main character Florya. This was done through great special effects along with dramatic sound effects. The experience of this film is unforgettable and in my eyes overrides countless films that glorify war.",Null,1,1,31 July 2010
