Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not the 'Comedy Classic' You've Heard About
","I finally got around to watching 'Borat,' and have to say disappointed doesn't even being to cover it. I can appreciate all kinds of comedy, and mockumentary is one of my favorite genres, but, this film really confuses humor with jokes at someone else's expense.I don't think I've ever been more uncomfortable watching something unfold. The Bed and Breakfast scene with the elderly Jewish couple was appalling, and to think that these people were duped into someone else's punchline makes it doubly so. Like someone else on this post pointed out, the scene with the dinner party was also cruel. Under a different guise, these people were opening their lives up to someone--in their minds, helping someone fit in, and they were rewarded by someone insulting them as being unattractive, having feces presented to them at the dinner table, and having what they believe is a prostitute show up on their doorstep. The antiques dealer has his merchandise destroyed in front of him, and women on an elevator are the target of what boils down to as indecent exposure. Why is it that Pamela Anderson can be totally in the loop on what's going down, but, other people are totally lied to? When I found out that the villagers in the opening scene weren't completely in the know, that was sort of the straw breaking the camel's back for me.If this is what 'the next generation' believes to be cutting edge humor, then, our society is in worse trouble then I thought. It goes well beyond crass humor. I'm as liberal and open minded as can be, and I am a firm believer in freedom of speech and supporting the arts, but, 'Borat' just seemed like a yuck fest that centered around little more than picking on the slow kid. I don't want to ever think that sort of comedy is funny.",2,21,42,7 June 2007
As Good as It Gets," The Torpedoe Intended to Sink 'Titanic'
","The epitome of everything wrong with Hollywood: We're to believe that Helen Hunt's character would fall for an obsessive compulsive, much older Jack Nicholson. Only in La-La-Land.This film fails on so many levels...down to Helen Hunt's in-and-out Brooklyn accent. What could, and with all arguments should have been a dark drama, instead, under the direction of James L. Brooks, decides to compete in the genre of 'Romantic Comedy.' Going for all the laughs, we're expected to believe that a waitress, who has an asthmatic son, is going to endear herself to a person who everyone hates waiting on...so much so that she decided to take a road trip with that person, accompanied by a gay man, who is the neurotic's neighbor--who has nothing to endear himself to the obsessive compulsive, other than his fairy jokes and insults. Oh, sure, Jack insists on taking Helen's kid to the hospital, but, outside of that, who cares? More unbelievable than Madonna playing a virgin, this film forces us to suspend our disbelief too many times for any free thinking individual to take it seriously.Sure--Hunt and Nicholson walked home with Oscars...but, look at what they had to compete with. And, where is Helen Hunt anyway? Now that the overrated 'Mad About You' has become Trivial Pursuit fodder, her career hasn't exactly taken off.",5,1,8,31 January 2007
Alexander," Something to ponder
","I have read through many of the comments on hear--most of them being mixed ranging from 'loved it,' 'luke warm,' to 'don't waste your time.'What I find the most fascinating is most people who knock the film find some way of stating throughout the course of the panning that Alexander was portrayed as too gay. I find it fascinating, because in the very next breath of a bad review, the tagline usually says, 'But, Angelina Jolie was hot.' Interesting double standard. Perhaps some people are 'too straight' to write an objective review, though I'm sure Ms. Jolie will take the compliment if not necessarily reciprocate it in all cases.James Bond through the course of 2 hours is totally expected to bed every woman he comes in contact with--all the while saving the day--but, for Alexander to be preoccupied with sex is totally outrageous in comparison with his quest to dominate the world as he knew it. If you think soldiers don't think about sex in the foxholes--think again. It's been said that the average male thinks about sex thousands of times a day. Just because you don't happen to agree with whom he chooses to make the apples of his eyes doesn't make it any less of a fact.For those others who like to categorize Alexander's sexuality as 'speculative,' read a book on antiquity. Before the days of Christianity (remember the days when they fed them to the lions?), ancient Greek and Roman men had homosexual lovers. Bare in mind, this was well before the birth of Christ. Once he was born, and the Christians got the upper hand as far as control, making Zeus and Jupiter pagan gods insuring a one way ticket to hell, it should come as no surprise that they wanted to damn everything that ancient Greeks and Romans did--down to their societal beliefs. The fact that it was 'hinted at' rather than graphically portrayed is probably due in part to the fact Stone wanted his film to 'play malls.' After all, it's called 'show business.' I say, if you weren't prepared to see what you saw, maybe you should consider it a gift. If you were expecting to see 'Platoon' in loin cloths and togas and feel you left the cinema cheated, think of how disappointed you'd have been seeing a historically accurate rendition of Old Alex's life. Good luck getting Colin Farrell to agree to that, too, I'm sure. There's an awful lot of 'Red States' out there, and just because you might not like history, questioning it's validity doesn't make it any less true. Not enough battle scenes? Possibly. Questionable accents? Definitely. A 'too gay' portrayal of Alexander? Doubtful.",Null,4,8,29 November 2004
The Devil Wears Prada," All the clich√©s, but...
","Meryl Streep saved this film, but, Emily Blunt deserves honorable mention in a tale that fell into place about five minutes into viewing it.'The Devil Wears Prada' doesn't follow a specific path that makes it outstanding among film. Nor, does it present a 'fresh and new' story that should make it rise above the films this year, or, even better, the last ten years. In fact, it's pretty formulated as far as plot goes.You have the misfit (Anne Hathaway) Andrea, who doesn't fit in with the job she's thrown into. You have the Ice Queen (Meryl Streep) Miranda who hires her anyway, and you have the Lady in Waiting (Emily Blunt) who is well qualified to succeed in a world that she's been brainwashed to believe is the Holy Grail. But, as far as movies go, we know who will win who over, who will move ahead, and who will graciously agree to step aside while the underdog has their glory.What makes the difference is the characters. Stock as they are, 'TDWP' provides us with two characters who actually take themselves seriously...Streep who epitomizes the 'don't mess with me kid' persona, and Blunt whom you actually give a damn about.So, for that reason, see 'The Devil Wears Prada.' The characters are too good to miss...even though the plot has been seen before.",8,0,0,15 January 2007
American Psycho," So Disturbing That a Second Viewing is Out of the Question
","Do not, I repeat, do not watch this film if you're up late and are looking for some 'go to sleep fodder.' Scary as scary can be, I could't possibly think of watching this film twice. It was brilliantly done. Christian Bale was phenomenal in his portrayal. But, the graphic violence is just too believable to view again. I found it to be one of the scariest films I've ever viewed, because it was without a doubt believable in its writing, acting, and execution.What makes his blood bath even the more scary is that no one knows who anyone is in this film. Which, in my opinion, is the reason, that in the end, he, himself does't know if he's done what he's done. A send up to 80's over indulgence, 'American Psycho' is absolutely worth viewing...ONCE",7,0,2,10 June 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Little Miss Sunshine, Best Picture?
","I was very surprised that 'Little Miss Sunshine' was able to garner as many nominations as it did for the Acadamey Awards. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film very much, but, I'm shocked--that's all.It's the story of Olive (Abigail Breslin), the ten-year-old pageant obsessed 2nd runner up to a Little Miss Sunshine title, who gets her big shot to compete in the National Pageant when the original winner has some sort of 'diet pill complications.' So she jumps in the yellow VW van with dysfunctional family in tow for a trek from Albequerque, New Mexico to Redando Beach, CA to take a shot at the crown. The trip proves to be as dysfunctional as the family, which includes her mother--trying to keep everyone together (Toni Collete), her positive thinking unemployed self help guru father (Greg Kinnear), her gay suicidal Uncle Frank (Steve Carell), her Nitzche studying vow of silence taking brother, who has dreams of being a military pilot (Paul Dano), and her brash, heroine snorting, old coot of a grandfather (Alan Arkin).Along the way, the family is forced to endure car trouble, former exes, mental meltdowns, job opportunities that go nowhere, and death. All the while, Olive's dream becomes their own and keeps them going to a finish that, while no one could probably predict it, isn't too far fetched to the average moviegoer.I have to say, it was a 'cute' little movie. I by no means wouldn't recommend it, but, Oscar worthy? I don't know. It makes me wonder if it was strategically placed to give competition to pre-Oscar hopefuls. Breslin, who, as far as child actors go, is very charming, may give Jennifer Hudson's Effie White ('Dreamgirls') a vote split--pushing through a dramatic performance upset in the Best Supporting Actress category (Hudson's award fell under Musical/Comedy at the Golden Globes). The same could be said for Arkin in the Best Supporting Actor category against Eddie Murphy ('Dreamgirls'), although, I think Arkin does a superior job, having seen both films. I also find it very telling that 'LMS' got the Best Picture nomination over 'Dreamgirls.' Though many might question 'Dreamgirls' ever getting nominated for the award in the first place, it certainly had the hype on its side. Maybe its a sign of the hype running out of steam, giving Breslin and Arkin a slight advantage to set 'Dreamgirls' as a whole up for a snub.Who knows? But, its a cute little indie film that might end up being the little engine that could.",7,2,4,27 January 2007
Dreamgirls," 'Dreamgirls' transfer to the screen
","Maybe it's because my expectations were so high that my eye was a little more critical, but, 'Dreamgirls'--while a very good film--didn't 'blow me away' like I guess I had hoped it would.Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a waste of time or money, but, with all the hype surrounding it, most notably the attention placed on Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, I was expecting a total jaw dropping breakout performance from Hudson, and a career performance from Murphy. What I got was what I was hoping not to get...just what I expected, unfortunately.What I expected from Hudson was an amazing voice and adequate acting...that's exactly what I got. What I expected from Murphy was adequate singing and go-for-laughs acting (trademark Murphy)...that's exactly what I got, too.Perhaps to his detriment, Murphy has made a career out of creating caricatures in his roles. It didn't help that when I remember back to early SNL, I remember Murphy did an impersonation of James Brown. I guess that's what I thought about during his performance of James 'Thunder' Early. When he does have a dramatic scene, we almost expect him to crack a smile or make a joke at the end of it. There are dramatic moments in his performance, but, for the most part, his presence on the screen is larger than life hysterics that left the audience chuckling 90% of the time he was on there. James 'Thunder' Early has a tragic side as well, and--except for the drug use scenes--Murphy didn't really convey them the way I'd hoped he would. In other words, it was really hard to distinguish between the role of Early and the actor, Murphy. It was almost as if Murphy was playing himself.Hudson, on the other hand, demands focus the moment she opens her mouth to hit the first chord we hear from her. No one can deny that she's got one hell of a voice. Unfortunately, it's when she's not singing that our focus from her drifts. Her line delivery isn't backed up with any expression to speak of, and no matter how they try to age her or transform her to later years, she still looks 22 years old. In musical numbers (with a few exceptions where her dancing looked a step off from the others), she comes alive. In dramatic scenes, she's a little overwhelmed. I don't know what kind of an acting career she can forge for herself if it's any role outside of a musical.Are these two Oscar winning roles? I don't know. The Acadamey likes to reward longevity, so Murphy definitely (especially with the Golden Globe nod) stands a chance. Best Supporting Actress is always the upset category, so, even though Hudson has been wracking up all the awards, with the clear front runners in other categories (i.e. Helen Mirren in 'The Queen'), I wouldn't be surprised if she has some unexpected competition. After all, the Oscar Awards are all about ratings, too. It is show BUSINESS. Why would they expect anyone to tune in if they already know who the winner is?As for the rest of the film, its visually appealing and very enjoyable. The music on the film, like in the Broadway production, is fantastic--and I didn't even mind the added-for-film song, 'Listen.' Beyonce Knowles is lovely and seems comfortable in the role of Deena. Anika Noni Rose does a fine job as Lorell, but, looks her age compared to Knowles and Hudson...about ten years older. Jamie Foxx doesn't really stand out, but isn't distracting. Danny Glover is as good as usual, and underutilized.So, go see 'Dreamgirls' and enjoy it for what it is. But, unlike 'Chicago' that transferred to the screen almost without any flaw, don't expect the same results.",7,0,0,27 January 2007
The Usual Suspects," Not 'The Usual Suspects'
","Everything a Hollywood script ought to be, 'The Usual Suspects' is smart, savvy, and totally unpredictable--thank you for restoring my faith in script writers.If you can honestly say you knew where this was going and where it was going to end, you're either institutionalized or a liar. I 'thought' I knew, until the last five minutes where Kaiser Sose's identity is revealed, and without giving too much away, Kevin Spacey delivers in spades.Why this didn't win best picture, I'll never know, but, I will say that if you're totally in the dark about this film, and love a good 'who-done-it,' you'll be well rewarded if you give 'The Usual Suspects' a try.",10,1,3,19 February 2007
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Having 'From Dusk Til Dawn' flashbacks....
","Well fleshed our characters-the ones that are fictitious, any way-and brilliant acting (especially from Leo and Brad), and a story that slowly (emphasis on slow) sucks you in as to where the fictitious storyline and the true crime story will end up...Tarantino has that ability when it comes to screenwriting...then, you get to the climax, and he hands it off to a 14 year old gamer boy, and says, 'Finish it'...said the same about 'From Dusk Til Dawn'...if you consider that one a classic, consider this one as 2.0...if you were unfulfilled the first time around, odds are high this film will leave you in the same predicament when the end credits roll....",Null,1,1,27 July 2019
Children of Men," Children of Men
","Since there is no 1/2 point system, I'll go 8--but, more like a 7.5.Having not read the novel on which it was based, 'Children of Men' came to me as story that--like most before it, and countless yet to come--probably didn't succeed in the transfer to celluloid with much satisfaction to those who loved the book. But, as a film, with no prejudice on my part, I was sucked in--but, it wasn't instantaneous, and I did leave with as many unanswered questions.This is the type of film that you've really got to stick with. I can remember saying out loud to those watching it with me, 'I have no clue where this is going,' but, with the words still in the air, it took shape.Theo, the 'hero,' is sucked in to a radical group formed from England's decision to deport all non-Brits. Society on a pandemic scale has broken down, and jolly old England is the only 'civilized' country left on earth. In order to preserve their empire, all immigrants out. Add into the equation that no child has been born in 20 years, and you've got the kind of chaos built for the year 2027. Kee, whom I gather was a black prostitute, has surfaced to the rebels as the lone fertile woman left on earth and she's great with child. They think the birth of her child will add to their cause. She wants none of it, so she and Theo with midwife Miriam in tow, set out to find the Human Project, and their ship 'Tomorrow' to take them away from all this.It was an exciting film that really heated up in the last third. Parallels are drawn to the concentration camps and genocide of wars in our history, current and past.Like many here on this board, I, too was sort of curious as to what was the cause of the sterility, and exactly who was this Human Project--but, through the writing, I got the sense that the characters in the story didn't know themselves, so I figured, 'Such is life. I don't have all the answers, neither do they. Typical.' If you're a purist to the novel, odds are, like every other screen adaptation, you're probably going to scream, 'Blaspahmy!' If you just want a thinking film where you leave with questions that lead to discussions, you'll probably like it. I did.",8,1,7,9 June 2007
Titanic," The Film That Launched 1,000 2+ Hour Films
","Remember when a film that ran over two hours was a shiny beacon among film that exemplified greatness? Extended length represented importance, and we all had to stand up and take notice to its magnitude.Now, add into the mix that we all knew what the ending was going to be. 'Titanic,' a very LONG story that history spoiled the ending to, made fools out of all the naysayers. Millions upon millions have seen this film, and we all know the outcome...brilliant! Where does that brilliance come from? Is it the acting? Well, nobody I know didn't want Gloria Stuart to walk home without a Best Supporting Actress Oscar...after all, we got her all dolled up and made her stay out late--but, it didn't happen.And, why didn't it? Was it the writing? Well, what can you say about a film that, for the last hour, at least, consisted of dialogue no more monumental than...'Rose!' 'Jack!' 'Jack!' 'Rose!' No, gentle readers, it's the special effects that kept the crowd there. As much as I hate the fact that I hate this film as much as I do on an intellectual level, I cannot deny that, no matter how many times I've seen that ship sink, I'm always mesmerized each and every time it does. Jim Cameron has indeed gone out of his way to stupefy us with his ending...and I bought it hook, line, and sinker.Although it took us almost two hours of banal dialogue to get there, the ending is absolutely spectacular in its delivery. No awards for acting or script--obviously--'Titanic' may sink, but the ending is not to be missed.",7,2,4,31 January 2007
War of the Worlds," 'War of the Worlds' Loses the Battle of the Plot
","'War of the Worlds,' revisited by none other than Steven Spielberg, may have been updated to enter the new millennium, but, it still suffers the same fate of its predecessors. Visually stunning as the special effects are in this installment of Alien Invaders' Flick, 'WOTW' didn't learn much from its distant cousins, like 'Independence Day' and 'Signs.' How many times are we to endure films that center around seemingly invincible space aliens coming to Earth, kicking our collective derri√®res pretty handily, coming oh-so-close to wiping us out completely, only to be defeated by simple, everyday obstacles? We're to believe that these aliens have the technology and capability to accomplish something that we as earthlings can't--intergalactic travel--but, can't prepare for the unexpected simplicities in life? In 'Independence Day,' the aliens didn't think to install Norton into their computer systems and were taken down by a simple virus. In 'Signs,' tap water proved to be their downfall. Here, in 'WOTW,' the aliens, who apparently need our blood to either operate their tripods or sustain their everyday diets, meet their nemesis in the form of bacteria...or microbes...or viruses...or...well, you get the picture. I'm not sure exactly why they needed our blood, but, they sure needed a lot of it, since it created some root system that encompassed the land far and wide. I don't know what that was about, it wasn't fully explained, but, it's pretty nasty all the same.At the end of the day, an everyman--in this case Tom Cruise's character, Ray Ferrier--steps up to the plate and saves the day when military intelligence and scientific minds fail. Ferrier is a divorced father with two of the most ungrateful kids (Dakota Fanning, as Rachel, and Justin Chatwin, as Robbie) I can recall in cinematic history. The threat of alien annihilation can't even seem to endear them to their old man--so much so that Robbie would sooner take his chances fighting the aliens along side the military, with absolutely no training whatsoever. Man--if you'd rather die a horrible death than put up with your father, that's pretty harsh.Of course, at the end of the day, score one for planet Earth. The tripods get some sort of dementia as a result of something in our blood that didn't set well with them, and their force fields--up until now, impenetrable--become nonexistent, so they can be blown up with no fuss or muss. Still, there are plot holes galore to ponder...1. When the plane falls from the sky at Ray's ex-wife's house, there are no bodies lying around it. Hell, as others on this board have stated, the family van they acquire was spared. 2. There is a train on fire still moving very steadily along a track without exploding or running off course. And, even though power is spotty depending on where you go on your quest to get from New Jersey to Boston, the train signals at the intersection work without fail. 3. When they reach the ferry, there are a whole bunch of working vehicles on it--so, why did Ray, Rachel, and Robbie almost get torn limb from limb a few blocks from the terminal by a hostile crowd that looked like they hadn't seen a moving car in eons? 4. As nutty as Tim Robbin's character is, wouldn't it stand to reason that as desperate as everyone in this film has been up until the point we meet him, Ray and Rachel wouldn't be the only ones he's managed to coax into his basement? And furthermore, with all the destruction going on all around him, even the craziest of lunatics probably would have had the good sense to run like hell. And what was that house made out of that left it standing, still in tact, anyways? 5. Probably the most inconceivable, how on god's green earth did Robbie manage to make it to Boston on his own when we saw him run over a hill that two seconds later was engulfed in an explosion that NOBODY could have survived--let alone escaped without so much as a scratch? And miraculously, the whole family was reunited at the in-law house in tact. When they came to the door it was almost as if they were expecting to see the Fuller Brush salesman. Did it not dawn on them that, oh yeah, it could be aliens coming to eat you alive? There are more plot holes, to be sure, but, not enough space to address them. Sufficive to say, with the length of this critique as further proof, for all the smarts it took to create CGI, the plot got the shaft for its Einstein moments.",4,2,4,4 February 2007
Ray," Spot on 'Ray'
","I'm giving 'Ray' a 6, and I didn't even finish it. Jamie Foxx does the best, bar none, impression of Ray Charles you have ever seen, and will probably ever live to see. For that reason, and that reason alone, you should at least attempt to view this film. Unfortunately, I couldn't last that long to see it to completion.I found the story uninteresting. Once I saw how amazing Jamie Foxx was as Ray, I couldn't focus on the material that was being presented. It rambled, it drug, in short, it lost me...I might have lasted an hour.Oscar win for Best Actor, hands down. But, would I recommend it? Hard to say...couldn't ride that horse to the finish line. Maybe you'll fair better.",6,0,3,4 February 2007
The Terminal," The Terminal (2004)
","This film just screamed 'Oscar! PLEASE, I WANT AN Oscar!' for Tom Hanks. It's films like this that make me think he's giving Robin Williams a run for his money as the highest priced whore in Hollywood, with Nicole Kidman and Jude Law running a close third and fourth, respectively. Meaning, each of them seem to be in any film. Good, bad, or indifferent, each of them is turning into the cinema's version of the Bible in American hotels...they're in every drawer.Give him an accent and a few closeups with teary eyes and swelling violins and we're supposed to be moved. Oh, I was moved, all right. Boredom has the tendency to make one fidgity.This film moves slower than the Macy's checkout line at Christmas. It only took about five minutes to realize this was an award vehicle for Hanks, and what seemed like six hours to endure it. Think Robin Williams' turn in 'Jakob the Liar.' Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a forgettable and insignificant supporting role as the ditzy Napolean loving flight attendant that we are supposed to believe would be happy with a Sbarro's pizza rather than a candlelit dinner. Stanley Tucci plays the 'mean old airport man' with one loud note throughout. Of course, the rest of the cast represents airport staff that we are also supposed to believe care enough to a) notice Hanks's character and b) become endeared towards him--to the point that his actual 'departure' from the airport would shut down operations to go see it. Anyone who's ever had a long lay over at JFK knows what a laughable premise this is.A huge disappointment to Spielberg fans. Hopefully, he's gotten these mushy feel good flicks out of his system.",3,2,7,24 December 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," The Greatest Film to Never Win an Oscar
","Far and away, 'The Shawshank Redemption' deserved, with every fiber of its being, to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. Morgan Freeman, who, until 'Million Dollar Baby,' had been robbed of an Oscar for films such as 'Driving Miss Daisy,' had his pinnacle performance for 'TSR.' Beautifully crafted, totally captivating, and flowing effortlessly with Freeman's narration, 'TSR,' for all its gray colors, paints an exuberant portrait of life behind bars--the wrongly convicted Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) adapts to prison life, all the while calculating an escape that spans three decades. Keeping his friends close, and enemies closer, Dufrane takes a seemingly innocent hobby and turns it into a redemption that takes him to Mexico, with Red (Freeman) serving his time and following suit.If there is a film that speaks more to the believer in all of us, I haven't encountered it yet. It doesn't matter what hour of the evening, or what mood I'm in, if 'TSR' is playing...I'm watching, and loving it just as much as the first time around.It's been fourteen years...if you haven't seen it, ask yourself, 'What the hell's wrong with me?'",10,0,0,30 January 2007
The Queen," What's the point? The point is...
","I always read the negative reviews on IMDb first. I do this because, sometimes, in my mind, I have a very 'blinder view' of a film and like to hear the opposing view...or, I like to commiserate exactly what I felt was lacking.In this case, I'm torn. Make no mistake--the film was wonderful, to put it mildly, but, I won't even begin to debate its authenticity of the plot line--given that I'm a born and bred American who hasn't a clue as to how the Monarchy is perceived in modern England.That being said, I had to think of 'Angels in America.' The play, later adapted to the small screen, took a particular community--that being those individuals directly living day to day with AIDS and HIV--and used them as a way to convey a bigger theme. Many categorize 'Angels' as being an AIDS play--but the characters and their individual challenges are merely a catalyst to the overall message.In 'The Queen,' I felt the overall, universal message was watching what you've known to be true become false before your very eyes. Here we have Queen Elizabeth II, thrown into a position that, while hereditarily probable, was quite unrealistic in the broad scheme of things. She learned, at an impressionable age, the rhetoric and protocol that she wasn't raised to enforce. So, sitting on the throne for 50+ years, she reacts the way she feels is her legacy. She's seen, while choosing to ignore it at first, that she is quite wrong in her assumption. The people want and need more. While none of us has sat on throne in England (save, of course, the loo), we can all identify with the conflict at large.Helen Mirren is uncanny in appearance and supposed conduct of Queen Elizabeth II. She conveys the confusion, agony, and submission of the Queen in such a palpable way that I stopped wondering or caring whether or not it was documented fact.This could have been any family in Anywhere, World, and the message--accurate or not in its conveyance--was abundantly clear. No one likes to be thrown under the bus--whether we're raised to be in that position or whether we find ourselves there through no other reason than happenstance.Ignore the details and enjoy the film for its message. If that's too much to take into a movie theater, then, look elsewhere.",9,1,2,17 December 2006
Shark Tale," Shark Tale (2004)
","Another American Airlines flight...another movies I'd never pay to see in a theater, but, since it was available to me, I watched.I've read several of the comments on here, and although the criticisms are different, the overwhelming theme is the same...who were they making this film for? I don't consider myself slow on the uptake at all, but, this film went too quick for most of us who've sworn off cocaine since our rock star moments from the '80s. Therefore, I'm not the least bit surprised that kids were bored and/or lost interest.So, was it meant for adults? Possibly, I guess. I don't know many toddlers who could make the connection between Katie Couric and Katie Current--but, then again, I can't say as I run in too many circles where toddlers are present, so, maybe I'm sorely underestimating our wee youth in America. All that aside, it had elements of 'The Godfather,' but was a little too hip-hop for me to truly identify with it. WAY too hip-hop, truth be told. Before I'm labeled as someone who's completely out of the loop, it's fine to have those references--but, there's such a thing as overkill. If you overkill with someone who doesn't listen to Missy 'Misdemeaner' Elliot on a regular basis, you can't be too shocked when someone feels alienated.So, what about teens? I can't imagine they'd pick up on 'The Godfather' references--but there again, I don't run in packs with teenagers. Also, the overall 'themes' the movie tried to hammer home--honesty and acceptance--would seem to be a little too remedial for anyone over the age of 10.Target audience aside, there was nothing truly spectacular outside of the animation. This is sort of disappointing considering the vocal talents cast list included the likes of Robert DeNiro, Angelina Jolie, Renee Zellwegger, and Martin Scorcese. I've always thought Will Smith in the flesh was so over the top that he bordered on being a walking 'Looney Toon.' To experience him in actual animated form is a bit like dropping acid and participating in a high speed chase from the cops on a stormy night in Vegas. Scorcese's puffer fish dancing the 'cabbage patch kid' was a little reminiscent of Barbara Billingsly speaking jive in 'Airplane!'--only not as funny. And, once again, we have a effeminate shark in 'dolphin drag' coming out of the 'vegetarian closet' to his mobster father shark. It doesn't tax the imagination too much to see where they were going with this, but, there again, the Island of Misfit Toys in 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer' handled it with much greater sophistication...after all, no one wants a 'Charley in the Box.' Cost of plane ticket aside, I wouldn't have seen myself renting this film, and, as I said from the start, would never have paid to see it at the cinema. I guess if you find yourself on a flight across the country and it's on, provided there's not a $5 charge for headsets, you could do worse as a captive audience.",3,1,6,24 December 2004
