The Blair Witch Project," Do whatever it takes to see this film.
","I live in Lubbock.  The premeire of BWP was in Austin.  I drove 400 miles, each way, to see this film.  The lines were the longest I'd ever seen, and it took over an hour to get to the front of the line.It was worth every freakin' second of effort.Never has a film given me the stone-cold creeps as this one.  Sleep after viewing does not come quickly or easily.  You'll be discussing the characters' situation and the quick, brutal ending for hours.  Negative reviewers are just trying to look smart.  Forget them, see the film, and never forget it.",10,1,2,18 July 1999
