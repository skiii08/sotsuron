United 93," open to opinion
","I've just finished watching this movie and i have to say it was one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen,, i also love the fact that to go with the conspiracy theories that are about such as 'flight 93' was shot down by US defences, the movie never actually showed the aircraft crash and fighter pilots were present in the movie to keep an open ending to the film, either that or this was for pure respect and didn't show the aircraft after the crash. all in all brilliant movie respecting all peoples opinions. the only down fall of this movie was the length but that does add to the individuality to the movie and doesn't over dramatise the events of 9/11 and shows the truth.",9,0,2,7 May 2006
