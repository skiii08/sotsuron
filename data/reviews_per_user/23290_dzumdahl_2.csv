It," Eh
","Underdeveloped twats star in this movie. Loved the chubby one. Second best comedy of 2017, only to my ACTUAL father, Ryan Reynolds' movie, The Hitman's Body Guard.",7,2,5,13 February 2018
The Martian," Fantastic
","It was well made, sure, but Childish Gambino was in it, so it's fantastic. Too bad Sean Bean did not die. Was disappointed. That'll happen.",9,0,2,13 February 2018
