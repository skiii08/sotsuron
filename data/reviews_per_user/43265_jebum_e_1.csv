The Hangover," Hands down, this is funniest movie I've seen in a long time.
","I don't normally go to theater to watch comedy movie but last night, I somehow ended up seeing this movie at the big screen, and I do not regret it at all. I absolutely loved the movie because it was funny as he11 but not corny or grossly funny. My wife was feeling a little skeptical going into the movie as well but we came out feeling pretty satisfied. I would recommend going to theater to watch this movie because, trust me, it is more funny when room full of people burst into laughter all at the same time. I actually do want to see this movie again. I loved the last movie credit part so make sure you guys don't miss that in theater.",9,2,5,3 July 2009
