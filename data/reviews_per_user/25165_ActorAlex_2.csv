Gremlins," Don't Miss Out On A Great Film! A Kid's Review
","SEE 'GREMLINS'. Everything about it is wonderful. I don't care if you stop reading this review. I won't be offended. Go to the video rental place, rent 'Gremlins', and enjoy this instant classic.For those of you that will wait a bit before you leave to be entertained, here is what the movie is about. The movie 'Gremlins' is about a boy named Billy Peltzer. For Christmas, he gets three unusual rules, (Don't get him wet, Don't expose him to light, and never, NEVER,feed him after midnight)and a cuter than cute as a button creature called a mogwai. The Peltzer family names the mogwai Gizmo, and instantly, and accidentally, for that matter, break the bright light rule. Gizmo is shocked for a moment, but recovers in seconds.They learn that bright light hurts Mogwais. The next 15-20 minutes are all just packed with extremely cute stuff that Gizmo and Billy do together. then, the water rule is broken, and Gizmo multiples. The new mogwais are nothing like Gizmo. They just seem meaner than Gizmo(and they all ARE meaner). The new mogwais have a leader mogwai named Stripe. (Stripe has a white puffy Mohawk on his head, so you can tell him apart from the other mogwai.) And finally, the new mogwais trick Billy into feeding them after midnight, and become (you guessed it) Gremlins. The Gremlins are as mean-spirited as they were when they were mogwai! They are still even lead by Stripe! And Stripe still has a puffy, white Mohawk! The only differences between the Gremlins and the evil Mogwais are: Gremlins are slimy and evil and can hurt you, and the mogwai are furry and evil and cannot hurt you (yet). The Gremlins reek havoc,(but worse, MUUUUUCH worse) on the town, which is very funny.The acting is tremendous and the puppetry is amazing and the movie itself is jaw dropping. See 'Gremlins'. one of the most unforgettable movies ever made.",10,0,2,17 April 2006
Back to the Future," A Masterpiece For Ages Young And Old! A Kids Review
","SEE 'BACK TO THE FUTURE'. I know I opened 2 of my comments like this so far, but I say this for a good reason. If your child says 'It's too boyish.', 'It sounds boring.', or some other kind of whine or nasty comment, MAKE them see it. I even said I wouldn't like it! I said it with 'Star Wars' too! Then my Dad FORCED me to see it, and now it's his fault I enjoyed these movies from start to finish. I'm sure you're child will be overjoyed with these movies too. If your a kid or teenager, take it from a 9-year-old, you'll adore it. If you came here looking for a plot line, sorry! In my opinion, one little hint at the movie could destroy one of the surprises, making the goodness of the plot crumble before your very eyes!!! That was a little too dramatic, but who cares! It's still a good movie, and you understood that. All in all, this is a terrific trilogy, which the world will cherish forevermore. 'Nuff Said!",10,1,2,24 June 2006
