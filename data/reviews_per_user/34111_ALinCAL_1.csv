The Blair Witch Project," There's a thin line between love and hate...
","This makes one of over 1500 entries about this film, and I've not seen one critique yet that's middle of the road. There seem to be many factors at work here. The arguments range from 'if you're from the city, you won't get it' to 'the production values suck.'I'm sure that things such as one's background, to one's expectations, have a lot to do with the incredibly divergent attitudes about this film.There are reports of people walking out, and others of people being riveted to the screen. In the end, opinions are like rear ends - everyone has one. So, if you're interested - I'll just tell you about my experience....because to me BWP was an experience.I went to see it based on the hype. I read brief synopsis' on it at Artisan's web site. I had little knowledge of the story aside from the 'teaser.' The theater I saw it in was small, probably seating 200 maximum - and it was 95% full. No one walked out. No one laughed inappropriately. No one made comments. What I experienced was an audience captivated by a film that could very well have been splices of 'home movies' made by genuine amateur filmmakers. The 20-somethings act the way I have observed many of them acting - using the 'f' word often and without reason. In addition the fear and subsequent babbling and weird behavior seemed real (I'm speaking from personal experience).When this film ended, the audience was stunned, and for what seemed a long time, no one headed for the exits. I usually stay to read credits, while everyone heads out the door (sometimes being rewarded when the occasional out-takes follow some films). When the first person began to leave, the credits were nearly complete. It's the first time I've seen a reaction like this, ever, and I've been to thousands of films.Personally, I felt I was given enough knowledge from the interviews to understand that whatever it was these kids were seeking, was an entity the town-folk didn't want to deal with, regardless of their points of view.It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, caused me to sink a bit lower in my seat, and even though during the last minute or 2, I guessed what the last scene would be, it still took me by surprise.I have no opinion on those of you who didn't like it, or weren't somewhat scared, because, after all we're all different - and liking or not liking something doesn't make folks in either camp more or less intelligent than those in the other. It's all just reflections of our backgrounds, religious upbringing, environments, etc. What I do have an opinion on is, despite my feelings of this being an unique look at an eerie subject, that for the guys who wrote and directed, this may be only a one time shot at using the method for creating this true 'horror' film. Best of the year? Hard to say. Maybe not, but pretty damned creative. I like films such as 'In Country,' and 'Inside Moves' (both widely ignored by critics and filmgoers alike) and I only watch 'Law & Order' or 'Homicide - Life on the Street' on TV (damn NBC!).And, I liked BWP, because it made me afraid for awhile and caused me to think about it long afterwards. When a film makes me feel, it works for me. I'd recommend it - with the preface that not everyone is gonna like this film. It's one of my 50 favorites, but I may not see it or watch it again for awhile. I keep seeing that last scene......",Null,1,1,10 September 1999
