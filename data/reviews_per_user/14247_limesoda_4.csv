The Blair Witch Project," Well I did smoke alot of weed......
","So that could be in part why this movie scared me wit-less, and the 'Seeing through someone-elses eyes' feeling was cool. I did re-watch the film while str8 a few days ago and it did scare me again... well the end did. So to cut a long story short you don't have to be high to like this movie, if only the same could be said for Battlefeild Earth.",10,2,3,27 February 2001
Final Destination 2," So far the best 'Part 2' Movie I've seen this year.
","Well, I would like to start my review by listing some stinker sequels that were released this year but then we'd be here for a while.I've been watching horror movies since I was 7 Starting with The nightmare franchise, and one thing I've noticed with horror lately is that instead of making you anxious and creeped out to get the scares, most Horror movies go for the BOOO! Scare where the killer jumps out of the shadows or there is a period of inactivity followed by someone jumping in through a window or some crap like that. To be honest I find that to be a cheap scare when done alone. In 'The Exorcist' there was an absence of the BOOO! Scare because they knew that the audience would be scared by what was happening on screen, the horror of the situation.  This is what I believe this movie accomplishes an actual good mix of foreboding and the BOOO! Scare. The movie is set up so you think you know what's going to happen then it kind of tilts it on it's ear. Most of the deaths follow a system that worked for me... The Set-up - Foreboding - The Fake out - Relief - BOO! Or in some cases just plain old surprise. I enjoyed both this and the original because of the main plot in both of them, which was how can you defeat something that isn't there?",8,0,0,14 October 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Here is 1 theory *SPOILER ALERT*
","*SPOILERS AND BAD SPELLING WITHIN*
Ok here is a thought. Agent Smith was able to steal a body and get into the real world via the host. I think that Agent Smith had become a virus which was why he was duplicating himself into other programs and people. So what if when Neo was born he was in reality an anti-Viris Program that had been installed into a new born. He grew up met Morphius was released from the Matrix (Still a program in a human body) then at the end of Revolutions Neo absorbed the Viris (Smith) and was able to repair the corrupted files.To discuss further (or check to see if i've been taking my medication) E-mail me at scandalsheets@hotmail.com",9,0,0,8 November 2003
Titanic," My 2 cents... I'll be quick.
","Well I am finally getting a little sick of people bitching non stop about this movie, Why do I feel half of you that rag about it are doing so because for some reason it's become very trendy to bad mouth this movie. Then of course are the sudo-intellectuals that believe that movie + profit Crap. I'm not standing on my soapbox and proclaiming that this is the greatest movie of all time, because it isn't. I don't need for you love this movie or even like it, because everyone has there own opinions (see battlefeild earth, I thought that was REALY bad) However this movie still has merit. One last thought for those of you that have said ad-nauseum 'worst movie ever made' Lets see your movie then. Go and rent 'Clue'.LimeSoda'Those that can do.
