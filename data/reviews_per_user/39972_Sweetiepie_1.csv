The Sound of Music," I am Sixteen Going on Seventeen...
","Where to start?! This is my favorite movie of all time.  The acting and directing is sensational.  The music and scenery is beautiful.  Movies are truly not made like this anymore! I first saw this movie in 1990 when it was re-released on video for the 25th anniversary.  I was 6 years old and I immediately fell in love with it when my parents bought it.  My favorite character was Marta, the second youngest, because I looked exactly like her as a child.  Plus she was my age! My favorites of the children were Marta, Gretl, Liesl, and Brigitta.  My favorite scenes are 16 going on 17, Do-Re-Mi, when the Captain finds the children singing to the Baroness, Liesl and the Captain singing Edelweiss, The party for the Baroness, singing at the festival, hiding in the abbey, and finally climbing over the mountain to freedom.  Christopher Plummer does a fantastic job of playing the Captain.  He is handsome and very charismatic.  Julie Andrews, of course, was the star of the movie and also was fantastic...but we already knew that!  I think that Eleanor Parker's acting as Baroness Elsa Schraeder was underrated.  She played her character perfectly.  I actually liked her character, although she was called the 'villianess.'  Richard Haydn was very good as Uncle Max, he made me laugh. I only wish that Charmian Carr, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath had done more acting as they got older.  With the exception of Angela, the other three stopped acting to raise a family.This is one of the greatest family films ever made! 10/10",10,1,7,26 June 2003
