Alien 3," Wish it had never been made.
","Did IQs drop sharply while this film was being made? How did the facehuggers get on to the Sulako? How? Watch the end of Aliens - the Queen is quite clearly NOT carrying any eggs. This is the worst type of sequel, one which undermines previous films in an attempt to eclipse them. The story for Alien3 doesn't consider Alien or Aliens at all. Unforgivably it instead does its best to wipe the slate clean killing Newt and Hicks off in the cheapest most anonymous way possible. This makes the rescue of Newt (the last 20 minutes of the fantastic and infinitely superior Aliens) totally redundant.The sets and music are on the whole good but lack the imagination and variety of the previous two films. The CGI is dreadful, the Aliens size is inconsistent and on several occasions it looks as 2 dimensional as the plot. Also the inter crew tension from the first film and marine banter from the second film is replaced with vulgar insults exchanged between the prisoners. Its a strange coincidence that the sole convict character with any merit is the only one with an American accent. Sigourney Weaver puts in a huge effort but its not enough.",5,496,542,27 July 2004
