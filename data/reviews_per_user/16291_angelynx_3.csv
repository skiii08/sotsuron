Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Non-stop high-energy old-fashioned FUN!
","Everyone, *ignore* the whiny negative advance reviews and go see this movie! It is such an exhilarating rush it literally left me breathless. Dense political machinations balanced out by stunning visual beauty, a touch of comedy and some of the greatest science-fiction action sequences ever. Already being a SW fan will help you appreciate much of the plot-establishing material (and a lot of the dialogue), but I think ANY movie fan can enjoy it for its astonishing visuals, its exciting battle and race scenes, the calm and clever bravery of Queen Amidala and the touching scenes between young Anakin and the mother he has to leave behind. (I know this will be one of 1000 reviews - can't wait to read the rest!).",9,0,0,19 May 1999
Blade," Dumb, soporific and underacted
","Expensive-looking but d-u-m-b. *Again* the cliche of the undead secret society that controls the world. *Again* the cliche of the arcane techno-magical process that ALMOST gives the villain total power but it defused at the last instant. And why on earth did Snipes, a capable actor, walk through this film with only one facial expression? - not even true to the comic book character. Skip renting this one and play a game of 'Vampire: The Masquerade' instead.",4,1,2,1 January 1999
Titanic," All that fuss about this?
","Sorry, but I just don't see what all the fuss is about here.  Handsomely designed and appointed movie, terrific special effects and costumes, etc., but the leads are so bland and lackluster that I wasn't able to care whether they drowned or not. Winslet has exactly one facial expression, deCaprio is much too '90s to be convincing as a 1912 roustabout, and neither of them made me believe they were passionately in love, which makes most of their actions in the last hour look simply brainless if not suicidal.  Most interesting relationship in the film is actually between Rose and the ship's designer...",5,1,2,30 December 1998
