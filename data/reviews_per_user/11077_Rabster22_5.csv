United 93," Lacking, but I don't know where.
","I have just recently watched this (much vaunted) film and found it lacked *something* but I couldn't quite work out where. The film doesn't rely on heart-wrenching phone calls (like Flight 93) but focuses on the confusion and impotence, of air traffic control and a military command centre that cannot quite grasp what is going on. Very true I am sure, who the heck trains for such an event? Yet it leaves the viewer feeling cold rather than emotional. The lack of govt. and indeed military response maybe the point, but when has that been news? The passengers and crew, having realised the situation are given just enough due credit for their actions, but it all seems to come to little too late in the movie. Upon reflection perhaps what was portrayed may have been realistic, but just too sterile.",6,0,2,8 September 2009
Apocalypse Now," Not Quite To The End
","A film that just cannot maintain it's quality to the end. A truly superb spectacle with first class performances all round, a stunning soundtrack, and thoughtful script, simply falls apart badly. Very badly. Dennis Hopper is a joke, Brando a bad joke. If you walk out, switch off or whatever with about twenty minutes to go, you will have seen something special.",9,0,1,27 October 2003
Schindler's List," A one watch wonder
","This film is truly riveting...if you have never seen it before. One can even forgive the excessive time it takes to tease out some sort of story. However, on subsequent viewings it quickly becomes tedious, unlike other films it retains no shock value, in fact it seems positively pedestrian. Watch it once, you will be captivated, beyond that it has nothing.",6,2,14,18 April 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," Perfect for this World
","I really couldn't say how wide the appeal of this film might be, it occupies a particular world and it is one that I know well. It is perfect for this world. The smallest detail is given as much care as the overall look and the result is laugh out loud cinema of the highest quality.",10,0,3,17 August 2003
The Breakfast Club," Drivel
","This film is awful, just awful. Five kids are in detention and each one is a Hollywood clich√©. We have the 'jock', the 'weirdo' the 'geek' etc. Even the teacher / supervisor is a disinterested clot. The 'tough guy' (he wears a leather jacket - ooh, scary) comes from the 'wrong side of the tracks' with a drunken father. Molly Ringwald is the gal who doesn't quite fit in. Yawn. The acting is fine, the script and storyline is woeful. The set-up dictates the opening tension but of course we are given (spoon-fed) the supposedly odd alliances between these (supposedly) different characters and a vaguely mutual anti-establishment bond is formed. If you like dialogue or are over eighteen and by great fortune have missed this dross then avoid at all costs.",3,2,8,11 February 2009
