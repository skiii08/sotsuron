The Blair Witch Project," Best horror movie of the 90s.
","I remember when I watched this film with family. My parents, myself, and my brother and his wife. After the ending when the recording went dead and the movie was over, the room was dead silent. As far as any of us knew, the events in the film really happened and that made it even scarier. 'Found footage' was not a genre yet when this movie came out, and that unknowing is one reason the movie was so effective. If you're one of those reviewers who hates on this movie 20 years later without taking that into account, you have no business giving your lame 1-star review.Don't get me wrong though, TBWP is still scary even to this day, and I'd easily consider it the best of the found footage horror genre.10/10.",10,0,2,5 April 2019
