Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," More Like Bore-at!
","I've had funnier poops than Borat: Cultural Learnings of America Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakstan.Where to begin? Sacha Baron Cohen is NOT a Kazakhstani TV talking head dispatched to report on the United States. He is instead a rather ridiculous presence, not to mention an arguably poopy comedian. There were times when I felt like I was watching a rerun of The Crotch Chronicles. And what's with the suit, Chuckles?Also, the whole 'Pamela Lee playing herself' thing is getting old. She ain't no Della Reese. They needed some real comic relief. You know who they should have brought in as comic foil? Bull the bailiff from Night Court. Sock it to me!One thing I will say is that Borat: Cultural Learnings of America Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakstan has some pretty crazy writing. It was making my brain switch gears back and forth like a dysfunctional slinky. Imagine that big Borat head on an IMAX screen.Overall, I do not recommend Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakstan.",1,29,72,31 October 2006
Deja Vu," More like Deja Pooh
","I've had more thrill-packed poops than Deja Vu.Where to begin? Denzel Washington is NOT a time-traveling do-gooder as he would have us believe. Instead he proves once again why he is one of the most inconsistent actors of our time, delivering a stale, if not poopy, performance. It was like The Crotch Chronicles all over again. Come on, Denzel! Mommy loves you.There are many more problems with the film, but there's not nearly enough room here to list them all (think Gabe Kaplan on a shrink's couch). I don't know what Val Kilmer is doing in this movie. As usual, he makes you long for the poetic subtlety of Robert Hegyes. Here I was hoping this would be the movie where they finally bring back Bull the bailiff from Night Court.What I will say is that Deja Vu has a pretty crazy performance from Paula Patton as Claire. This lady knows where to find the pickle! She's got a bright future ahead of her, if Hollywood knows what's good for it. I read she likes corn.Overall, I do not recommend Deja Vu.",1,19,36,23 November 2006
Star Trek," More Like 'Poop Trek'
","I've had poops that took me closer to the final frontier than 'Star Trek.' Where to begin? Chris Pine is NOT Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the starship Enterprise. If Pine was playing the role for laughs, bumbling around like Robert Hegyes after a wild night at Red Lobster, then he succeeded. There was about as much life in his performance as a bad rerun of 'The Crotch Chronicles.' But, I digress.Or do I? Can someone tell me what Oz Perkins is doing in this film? Heck, while we're at it, why don't we cast 'Sloppy Ivan' French in the role of the hunky alien? Villain-wise, I was not buying this Wookie claptrap. They should have signed Bull the bailiff from 'Night Court' instead: 'I could'a been a contenda''.On the positive side, no one can draw the most out of rabblerousers like Solomon Merasty quite like director J.J. Abrams. I'm convinced that guy could make a fecal stick exciting. But it's not enough to save this spoonful of chum liver oil of a movie.Overall, I do not recommend 'Star Trek.'",1,19,40,8 May 2009
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Days of Future Crap!
","I've had more heroic poops than 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.'Where to begin? Am I the only one who thinks Hugh Jackman is getting a little long in the shorts to play Wolverine? At this stage of the game he would be better off in an episode of 'The Crotch Chronicles.' As for the rest of the high-powered cast, may their next film have 'X' in the title not because it's a sequel, but because they'll have been banished from Hollywood and forced to make the naughty motion pictures!I caught this one at an early screening and everyone in the audience walked away looking like Robert Hegyes after catching the red eye. They found themselves actively rooting against the time travel plot, the Croation-looking special effects and the overall sense of poopiness. One child cried as the beans spilled out of his hand.You've got to give Bryan Singer a lot of credit. The man is the directorial equivalent of Bull from 'Night Court.' But what did all of that work amount to? Over two hours of glib gibber-gabber, George Foreman-like cinematography and even 'Facts of Life' ripoffs.Overall, I do not recommend 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.'",1,32,149,20 May 2014
Saw III," I was SAWing logs
","I've had more frightening poops than Saw III.Where to begin? Tobin Bell is NOT a scary madman named Jigsaw. He reminds me of my seventh grade bio teacher, the sort of character who runs around with licorice dangling from his pants pockets. (Bell is also a poopy actor, but that's neither here nor there). The whole Jigsaw concept reminds me of a really bad episode of The Crotch Chronicles. I felt dizzy.Also, was anybody in that theater buying this cockamamie plot about the dude kidnapping the doctor? What's that all about? Or the part where he maims that guy? I felt like I was watching a different movie. I'm comfortable in saying I'd be more frightened watching Bull the bailiff from Night Court. To infinite and beyond!On the plus side, I have to commend young Angus Macfadyen for his memorable role as Jeff. This guy is going to be the next Derek Daypuk! He had me believing all this warped nonsense was really happening right there in front of me. I had heartburn!Overall, I do not recommend Saw III.",1,5,10,31 October 2006
The Departed," Not Recommended!
","I've had more thrilling poops than The Departed.Where to begin? Leonardo DiCraprio is NOT the sort of man he portrays here. Instead he borrows a page from the Gutzon Borglum handbook. What I'm trying to say here is, he's a poopy actor in this one. Nothing against him personally, though. I just felt like I was watching my Aunt Freda's home movies (pumpkin pie, not!).Also, what is the deal with Jack Nicholson? The man's in his 80s and this is what he's supposedly doing? Running around like a squid that just had its ink squeezed out? I miss him when he was the Penguin. He should have been replaced with Bull the bailiff from Night Court. Up your nose with a rubber hose!I actually love Marty Scorsese, but what was he thinking? We have a word for movies like this back home, but I can't repeat it here (starts with a 'y' if you know what I mean). Hopefully he rebounds after this effort. As I sat through this one, I was really wishing that I was 'departed'!Overall, I do not recommend The Departed.",1,19,44,21 October 2006
The Holiday," I need a holiday from this crap!
","I've had more romantically comical poops than The Holiday.Where to begin? Jack Black is NOT a romantic leading man. Whatever happened to the days when he'd act like a maniac, jumpin' around and setting stuff on fire? Where is the Jack Black who would give you a wedgie while eating ice cream cake? Or the Black who climbs up flag poles to urinate? Kate Winslet is no help as the air-breathing damsel. Where's Robert Hegyes when you need him?And what about the writing? Can we get something with just a smidgen of originality, Nancy Meyers? I don't know, when I went and saw this movie I was hoping for the sort of comical romp reminiscent of The Crotch Chronicles. They could have livened this clunker up with Bull the bailiff from Night Court. What'choo talking' bout, Ivan French?In any event, applaud Nancy Meyers for trying. She failed miserably at whatever she was trying to do. I gots the hives. Kudos to Rufus Sewell, who is great in the role of Jasper. They should cast him as Jim Varney in the Ernest biopic.Overall, I do not recommend The Holiday.",1,4,9,9 December 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," More Boring Than Fiction
","I've had more entertaining poops than Stranger Than Fiction. And yes, that includes this morning.Where to begin? Will Ferrell is NOT a meek man whose life is being mysteriously controlled by a novelist. He's just a great big lug, chewing the fat and mingling the gums. I wish he would do Alf again... I used to love it when he'd eat cats and cough up hair.Also, what is with the Dustin Hoffman? What is this, his 1,000th movie and all of a sudden he tries to be Dr. Funnypants, PhD? He just wasn't right for the part, is all, homies. Why couldn't this be the movie where they resurrected the career of Bull the bailiff from Night Court? Dy-no-mite!One thing I will say is that Stranger Than Fiction has a good debut from Emma Thompson. This gal can induce laughter faster than that gruff homeless man who used to tickle us as youngsters. I'll take the glazed!Overall, I do not recommend Stranger Than Fiction.",1,8,46,12 November 2006
Casino Royale," Bet on this one and lose!
","I've had more suspenseful poops than Casino Royale.Where to begin? Daniel Craig is NOT secret agent James Bond 007. He is in fact a man-child, waving around a gun like it was his chocolate milk, nevermind that he's a poopy actor. He makes you long for Robert Hegyes. Craigers is hunky, but there are reasons not everyone can be Bond (i.e. cinnamon).This has got to be the lamest plot ever in a Bond movie. A banker winning at a casino to fund terrorism? Come on. That sounds like a bad rerun of The Crotch Chronicles. I miss Jaws, that lady who cracked your head with her shins, and Crackers McSnaggle. You know who would be a great Bond villain? Bull the bailiff from Night Court. You talking' to me?What I will say about Casino Royale is that some of the characters are pretty crazy. Judi Dench as M reminds me of my ninth grade home room teacher. 'Meat 'n' potatas.' High marks also go to Eva Green, who is NOT poopy in this one.Overall, I do not recommend Casino Royale.",1,12,38,17 November 2006
