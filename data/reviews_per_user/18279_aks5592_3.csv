Source Code," Keeps you on the edge.
","I was told about Source Code by a friend of mine who was psyched about it. So I decided to give it a try. I was expecting a usual action packed thriller with not much of a storyline. But, what I saw was a very well scripted, intellectually challenging movie with not too much action. I actually had to watch it again to get the full gist of it. The story revolves around a soldier played by Jake Gyllenhaal who did full justice to his role. This might be his best performance after Donnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain.Source Code, being a science-fiction, had some non-explainable facets to it. But, the writer did his best to keep things clear and not make it too complicated. It may probably not win an Oscar next year, nevertheless, it is the best thriller this year and deserves to be watched at least once.",8,4,7,24 April 2011
The Hangover Part II," It couldn't have been better
","Having seen the first part, you must be fooling yourself if you didn't expect the sequel to be absolutely crazy and awesome. The movie offers exactly that and much more. Its plot is more or less the same as the first, the only exception being Bangkok instead of Vegas. Even though the comedy is more hardcore and below the belt, it leaves you with tears of laughter and you're jaw stuck to the floor. Some scenes were so hilarious that for a second I almost forgot that it was a sequel.It may not be as good as the first movie, but it was a pleasant relief from the drought of comedies this year. The Wolfpack was awesome as ever with Zach leading the way. No offence to anyone, but, no one plays a weirdo better than Zach.Having said all that, I didn't quite like the ending, maybe because I knew what was going to happen next. This lack of originality may be the only reason for low ratings. But then, you don't expect the sequel of a movie like Hangover to be original, do you? I think the director did the best he could with this movie and delivered a gut-busting, rollicking experience.Hangover-II is the best comedy this year and if you watch it without any cynicism, you're sure to have a laughter riot.",8,20,40,26 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," A fulfilling end to a legendary trilogy!
","As this movie was the most awaited movie of the decade, I obviously wanted to watch it as soon as possible. My friend won some contest online and so, I got to watch it a few days earlier FOR FREE.The movie is everything you want it to be. The story is very well told and there is enough of Nolan-kind twists. Tom Hardy has some powerful lines as Bane but the enhanced voice doesn't work at all. But, he still does his character justice and performs to his full potential. For the first time in the trilogy, Batman wasn't the strongest. This gave a chance to Christian Bale to show off his acting skills without the mask and he did a fine job. The veterans Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine went about their job as if it was just another day at the office. But, a major surprise was Joseph Gordon-Levitt who portrays an ordinary police officer and pulls of an unexpectedly awesome performance. The special effects, sound and action were out of the world. Nolan spent a lot of money and he made it visible in the movie. The movie connects all the dots from the previous movies and provides a fitting end to the saga. Although, personally I liked The Dark Knight better. But, TDKR certainly came very close it.Finally, I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for portraying Batman in a way no one ever thought was possible and for making one the best trilogy of all time.",7,827,1375,18 July 2012
