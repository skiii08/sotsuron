Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Will the real Sasha Cohen please stand up?
","Yeah, it's kinda funny. Curious though how the targets of much of his humor are either M*slims or p**r people.I do have a great idea though.Let's get a guy to pretend he's from a place that know one knows about. Like say,the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia. (yes, like Kazakhstan it really exists - check Jewish Autonomous Oblast in wikipedia) But in reality, this guy would be a M*slim, from say Detroit, or Bradford in the UK. He would then go up a bunch of politicians, and associated dumb-asses in the US, pretending to be a reporter, with his mustache and funny accent, pretending to be Jewish, and coax them into say anti-M*slim things. This stuff would then be broadcast as comedy, on say,Al Jazeera.And he'd need a name, like say, Sashko Kohen.That would be pretty funny huh? Never been done before, has it? Oh wait...",3,21,147,7 September 2006
