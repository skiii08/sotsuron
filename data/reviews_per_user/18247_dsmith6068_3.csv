Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ups and Downs
","An uneven start to the series. Lightsaber battle much better than anything in episodes 4-6, although probably due to superior special effects. Having a little kid in the pod race and later shooting up the space ship is typical juvenile Hollywood antics.But the most illogical is having Anakin and his mother as slaves shows Hollywood's failure to understand slavery. His mother would have to be purchased, and she and later the boy, would have to be fed, clothed, trained, and prevented from leaving (even with the bomb implants which someone would figure out how to overcome.) All to get maybe 12 hours work or less. But in a droid based society, you would get 18 or more hours (after recharging) without the additional costs. Cost factors don't support slavery on these worlds, except possibly for Jabba's sex slaves.",6,0,0,27 November 2017
Passengers," Illogical Plot
","A ship on full autopilot would, when detecting a problem or malfunction, awaken senior members of the command staff, not a minor engineer. They would then awaken necessary repair staff. An android bartender who works but no (HAL 9000) type computer monitoring things is illogical.Jim could also have awaken the command staff to make repairs and fix a pod so both Jim and Aurora could go back into hibernation, so neither has to die.",1,8,13,18 September 2017
Concussion," CTE History and Sports
","A reasonably important movie to warn people (especially parents) about the danger of head related injuries from combat-style sports. And it does veer into the usual Hollywood conspiracy type movie of big bad organizations trying to suppress the knowledge from people.However, one important fact, Dr. Bennett Omalu didn't discover or name Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy as claimed in the movie. Although he was probably most responsible for extending it to American style football in his 2006 paper.'CTE was originally studied in boxers in the 1920s as dementia pugilistica. The seminal work on the disease came from British neurologist Macdonald Critchley, who in 1949 wrote a paper titled 'Punch-drunk syndromes: the chronic traumatic encephalopathy of boxers.' CTE was first recognized as affecting individuals who took considerable blows to the head, but was believed to be confined to boxers and not other athletes.' (Wikipedia) Also not mention is that in has impacted players in wrestling, ice hockey, mixed martial arts, soccer, Rugby, Australian rules football, baseball, and extreme (BMX) sports.
