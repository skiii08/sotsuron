Hereditary," Oof
","It's just not THAT good. It's incredibly slow and boring and not in the good way. It has its tense moments and the occasional disturbing scene, but it's mostly just sad. It also doesn't make any sense whatsoever by the end. It's not scary and it's really not even a horror movie. I'm being generous with a 6 because I appreciate the few tense and creepy moments and the disturbing parts and because I love the score (Colin Stetson does a brilliant job, as always). It could have been so much better if it were a half hour shorter and a whole lot scarier (and a final act that made sense). It's just kind of a confusing slog, and it's disappointing because I wanted to be disturbed.",3,1,4,2 October 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Believe the hype
","When I first saw this movie announced, I was skeptical. And by skeptical I mean I didn't care at all and forgot about it. But boy was I wrong. I love spidey but don't really care about the MCU, and this sure is a treat for any Spider-Man fan. Firstly, and most importantly, this movie has absolutely some of the finest, most impressive visuals I have ever seen in an animated film. There are tons of different art styles on display and it's a barrage of swirling color and sharp animation work. The character design is flawless - from the various spider-people to the excellent Doc Ock (who's a woman), Kingpin, and my personal favorite, the prowler. Speaking of The Prowler, who is by far the best character in the film, the scenes he's in are mostly intense, large scale chase scenes (there's an excellent homage to The Dark Knight when he gets on his motorcycle) and he is an intimidating and genuinely menacing character (although so is this Kingpin).
Also speaking of Prowler, the score and soundtrack to this movie are excellent. You've probably heard the soundtrack, consisting of great rap songs by some of the biggest names in the game right now. But the score is the unsung hero, specifically the sound design used for Prowler's scenes. Here, a sampled elephant call is warped and twisted into a ridiculously cool and terrifying sound that plays whenever Prowler is near. It's amazing at all other parts too, don't get me wrong, this is just the clear highlight.
The plot is immediately engrossing, incredibly emotional, and very, very well written, from the screenplay to the clever dialogue. I'm a huge horror movie fan who almost exclusively watches horror movies, but this movie is just absolutely stunning. My ONLY complaint is that I wish Prowler got more screen time.",10,1,2,15 July 2019
Joker," Some just don't get it
","This movie is spectacular. But there are some things you have to understand before you go and blast it - this is not a movie about the Joker. It's about a man BECOMING the Joker. Because of this, the 'Joker' we picture when we think of the character doesn't appear until the last 20-30 minutes of the film. The majority of it is a slow build chronicling a mentally ill man's descent into madness. This descent is a new origin story that takes more from The Killing Joke than it does classic Joker origin stories - and some people don't seem to understand that in comics, a character can be invented and reinvented and reinvented again. That's how we get characters like Miles Morales as Spider-Man. No origin is set in stone. For instance, The Dark Knight's Joker (I stand by The Dark Knight as one of the best movies of all time) has no origin that we know of. We have two unlikely stories he tells us. Batman (1989) calls the Joker 'Jack Napier'. So Joker (2019) doesn't follow a comic, it invents its own character. And it does so more in the style of Taxi Driver than a typical comic. It's really not a comic movie - it's a character study. And considered in that context, we have a purely excellent movie.
Phoenix is superb. Period. The music is epic. The cinematography is stunning. It's not 'overly violent', it's not 'too bleak'. The Joker is historically a violent character, first of all. Second of all, some of the best movies of all time are 'bleak'. Yes, it's gritty and it's kind of realistic but not really, and that's what you have to accept. The first hour and a half is good, great even, though somewhat slow - your attention is kept by Phoenix's excellent performance and some truly phenomenal scenes. But the last half hour is where it shines, creating one of the best final acts I have ever seen in a film. And no, it doesn't spark incel rage and if you can't tell the difference between film and reality, don't watch films.",9,1,1,5 October 2019
