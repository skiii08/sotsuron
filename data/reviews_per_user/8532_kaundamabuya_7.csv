Captain Phillips," Oscar Worthy, Extraordinary and Emotionally engaging
",This film easily falls under the top 10 films for 2013. Captain Phillips is an extraordinary film based on a true story of a Captain and his crew members who were boarded on their ship by modern pirates that tried to steel the valuable assets Captain Phillips and his crew were exporting.Captain Phillips is the one that tries with all his power to keep his crew safe. This is by far Tom Hank's best performance to date. Never have I seen so much energy and emotion invested by an actor. If you looking for a current film on the circuit that will leave you emotionally drained and beyond satisfied than this is the film. Every shot and scene in the film is ever so meaningful and does not waste any second of meaningless use. Definitely an Oscar Contender in the best screenplay category and best leading actor. Captain Phillips is a must see. You eyes are glued to the screen throughout the entire film.ps: Bring tissues,8,0,2,5 December 2013
Gravity," Emotionally engaging from beginning to end
",It's rare that I review a film as being been near perfect but Gravity was just that. The cinematography really tries to push the boundaries and perfectly executes the intention of making the viewers feel like they are in the situations unfolding on screen. Matt Kolwasky (George Clooney) quickly and easily attaches the audience to him. You love the character and feel for him. You want him to survive the entire film. George Clooney beautifully portrays a man that stays calm through extreme situations. This film would not be what it is without him. Sandra Bulloock does a great job some of the time but you feel the sense that sometime she is really forcing portraying the character of Dr. Ryan Stone in some situations but not so much that it was unbearable to watch. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n really out did himself here. The screenplay was well written no complaints there and the music score at the end just emotionally draws you in even more while watching this masterpiece. The only reason I gave this film a 9/10 was simply because what kind of film critic gives any movie a perfect. If I did then I would not be a film critic but from a personal point of view..........It's a 10!,9,5,8,17 November 2013
World War Z," Great science fiction horror action film
",I just have to say that if I had to choose the best Zombie movie ever made it would have to be World War Z. It's like any movie Brad Pitt stars in turns to gold. I loved the take on zombies here the fact that it was a virus that turned them into zombies and I commend the fact that they were not some dull slow moving sorry excuse of something you should be scared of. The main point of the movie is about finding a cure for the virus. This is a great movie to watch. A lot is explained in the movie but the things that have holes in it are explained why there is no answer. It is pretty a real movie down to there core with a great plot. Every scene has a captivating meaning. I feel that the movie deserves an 8/10 from a subjective and objective point of view.,8,3,6,24 July 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," More of a thriller
","It's rare that we get a serious Marvel movie these days since the first Iron Man but this was totally mind blowing. Captain America: The Winter Soldier too a risk and it worked. This was more of a thriller than just your ordinary super hero movie. This is the Dark Knight of Marvel. The story unfolded and a steady pace and for once no loop holes. Well written. This film dealt with real life government issues such as how far should the government go to keep us safe. The fight choreography leaves Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America in the Avengers by a gap. I have never seen so much character development in a Marvel movie as much as Captain America. In this movie we really get to see Steve Rogers flesh out his abilities. I am usually against Marvel movies so for me to incredible compliment this film is saying something. This is a must watch. Do watch it in cinemas. Truth is Captain America: The Winter Soldier beats The Avengers, Thor: The Dark Under World and Iron Man 3 by a gap.",8,5,9,31 March 2014
Interstellar," One of the most emotional films of 2014
","Interstellar is another masterpiece created by the genius known to the world as Christopher Nolan. I have to say though that every few minutes that pass in this film your heart really does ache. I mean although the film seems realistic, you don't want to imagine that the events in the film could ever really happen in real life. In the film 4 astronauts are sent on a mission to find an inhabitable world for humans to move to. The kicker about the mission is the duration it will take for the family the astronauts leave behind. This is a heart wrenching film and will leave you thinking about our world long after leaving the theater. This is a must see film for any aspiring filmmaker and film buff.",10,2,7,16 November 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Sorry as excuse of a reboot just to rake in some cash.
",If you have seen the previous Spider Man then don't waste your time watching this Spider Man. It was very childish not just compared to the Sam Raimi Spider Man but just on its own to. The Spider Man is basically the same story as the previous first Spider Man with minimal changes. From my understanding Sony was set to produce Spider Man 4 with the old cast and crew returning. Sam Raimi wanted an extended release date for the film so he could get it right but Sony was set against it. Sony wanted the cash cow franchise to rake in cash early. Sam Raimi felt he would not finish in time so Sony and the director parted ways. Sony released The Amazing Spider Man on the sole intent of making money. The fans interests were last priority to them. No franchise should be rebooted that fast. When comparing the Marc Webb Spider Man and the Sami Raimi Spidr Man the Sam Raimi take was much more mature. Remember...both Spider Man takes are both modern day takes and had big budgets and access to great special effects. Thus it comes down to who could direct the better movie. Sam Raimi wins by a long shot. Tobey Maguire portrayed a much more realistic nerd than Andrew Garfield. The Sam Raimi Spider Man had bigger and more entertaining set pieces. Last is the special effects and cgi. Marc Webb's movie looked way to fake. You could tell the burning cars were fake and the Lizard character looked to cartoonish. The smoke bombs the Lizard released looked like some out of a video game.,4,2,5,8 August 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Just Okay
",The movie is by all means not original but it is an okay pop corn movie. The action scenes is the only element the sells most pf the film. Captain America: The Winter Soldier beats Age of Ultron by far. Thus is not a must watch movie. You can really wait till it comes out on DVD. The film has too much going on and too short although there are 6 main characters. There is no character depth. Each character gets about 30 minutes of screen time at least except for Tony Stark. The film should be called Tony Stark and his followers. Quik Silver was wasted in this film. The best scenes are from Thor and War Machine. Thor is shown too be the mighty God of Thunder but at the same time he is downplayed with his powers. Don Cheadle delivers his lines extraordinarily well. This isn't a must see film.,6,2,9,24 April 2015
