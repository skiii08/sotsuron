Ford v Ferrari," Loved It .
","I've enjoyed Ford v Ferrari, Emotion is a very key element in the success of a film and also to connect the film with viewers, and this film has plenty of it, Matt Demon just killed it in the role of Carol Shelby, he emoted all the emotions perfectly especially in the close up shots, Christian Bale played the don't give a damn type of character of Ken Miles very well(atleast I looked at that character that way), his body language in the film suited the character very well. The storyline of the film is scripted in a way that it never felt boring, I sat on the edge of the seat during the Le Mans race. The soung design was perfect, watch it with sorround sound system and you'll like it, especially because it's a racing film, the sounds of foreground and background and the music behind were perfectly blended doesn't matter how many sounds you here at the same time. some shots in the film were also good. I recommend you watch the film.",9,1,2,1 February 2020
