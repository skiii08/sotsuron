Requiem for a Dream," Recommended viewing for fans of popular TV! - (Maybe spoilers.)
","I respect all those who think this is a great movie, and maybe it is. However, to me it seemed like an unrelenting nightmare that just got more and more disturbing. Moreover, it was obvious that it was just going to get more and more horrific from about one-third of the way through. With that foreknowledge, and not having known what kind of a film I was coming into, I kind of didn't want to stay, but did so only out of politeness.Having said all that, I would highly recommend this film to anyone who watches popular TV or likes the idea of taking slimming pills! If you are at all into stuff like that, go see this film!Oh yes, I suppose I did quite like the jumping fridge!",7,0,1,22 February 2004
