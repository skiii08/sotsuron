Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Enjoyable but forgettable
","It was a ridiculous concept making Lincoln a vampire hunter with the support of side kicks from the living and the dead. Also the idea that the former president is blessed with the flexibility and skills to shame a gymnast was too far fetched. Some of the support characters were weak and badly written, this was clear by the uncomfortable wooden acting. The sub-plots were also unclear as in the case of the characters Joshua Speed and Will Johnson. These characters seem to be added only to grease the wheels of the weak plot and they had little or no definition, both characters seemed to be hanging around the lead for most of the movie with no real reason other than to jump in at the nail biting moments and save the day. The movie for all its character flaws and plot line actually stood up, it was well made and the effects were good. The end result was enjoyable but thankfully forgettable.",6,0,0,24 February 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Very well made
","I'm not a huge fan of the Spiderman films and I had heard little or nothing in regards to this one from friends and colleagues alike.However the movie was I think better made than the previous versions of the character. Purists will find holes in some of the explanations of the character and his abilities if they compare it to the other movies, but better to take this movie on it's own merits rather than comparisons.I found the acting was very good from all the players and the filming had a very classy feel to it, the effects were enjoyable and not over the top. Above all there was a good sprinkling of humour from the character punctuated with good timing throughout the movie.Andrew Garfield played the part very well and surprised me with his clear acting abilities,Denis Leary is as good as always.It felt like money well spent picking this one up!",8,27,40,18 November 2012
Deadpool," A must see
","Deadpool is a must see movie.Ryan Reynolds was brilliant throughout. If you are looking for action, humour and some good music this movie has it all.There was never a dull moment and the superb writing and production combined with Reynold's timing and delivery made for many moments of really laughing out loud.This movie doesn't take the same serious approach as other super hero action movies, the central character is refreshingly flawed and likable for it, the movie was very well made on all levels its production values are as good as any of the blockbuster movies out there.I was totally entertained from start to finish.",10,2,7,25 December 2016
