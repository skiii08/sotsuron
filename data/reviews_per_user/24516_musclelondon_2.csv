Hereditary," When the audience laughs, things aren't going well
","If I could give this movie a zero, I would. Toni Collette had clearly been told to overact and probably make her lines up as she went along. Gabriel Byrne had been told to do the opposite and underact or he just couldn't understand why none of the lines were in his script.When you can't help yourself burst out laughing at the alleged scary bits they are filmed so badly, things aren't going very well. When have the audience is doing it with you, it does make you wonder why it was called a horror movie.When Gabriel Byrn catches fire, all the furniture had been pushed out the way to make sure it didn't burst into flames! Come on! How can anyone give this a ten!",1,7,16,25 June 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Not a perfect movie but still worthy of a ten.
","This is not the best movie ever made, it doesn't have the best plot, and it doesn't play all the hits all the way to the end. Boo boo! It's a movie not a concert. Having said that the audience I was in were stamping their feet, clapping their hands and behaving like they were in a concert and it was fantastic!Other movies may come along in time that delve more into Freddie's psychy but I don't care, I loved this movie with all its historical inaccuracies because it did what it was supposed to, it reminded me how brilliant Freddie was.",10,23,39,7 November 2018
