Requiem for a Dream," intense and depressing, but remarkable
","This movie is about drugs and sex.  And the bad things that can happen with drugs.  Ellen Byrnsten (i don't know if the spelling is correct) was great; she gave one of the greatest performences.  In the begining of it, this movie seems kind of dull.  But as it progresses it becomes more interesting. At the end you feel as though you want to kill yourself because it so depressing, but its truly a great film. Score: 8.",8,0,1,31 March 2002
Pi," very twisted, but interesting
","At first this movie makes no sense and seems dull.  But as you watch it, the movie becomes more and more mind-bending and extremely interesting to watch. Personally, black and white film usually makes a movie boring for some reason.  But the use of it in Pi gives you the feeling of being in Max's crazy mind.  Very intelligentlly put together and good to watch not more than once.",8,0,1,1 December 2001
Donnie Darko," dark and very original film
",I first wanted to see this movie when i saw a picture of this scary looking bunny in a magazine a few months ago.  I finally saw it and was blown away. I haven't seen any other movie like it.  The acting was great it in it.  I recommend this movie to anyone.,9,0,0,31 March 2002
