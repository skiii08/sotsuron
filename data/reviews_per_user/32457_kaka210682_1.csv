Skyfall," What they have done to 007
","I don't write reviews its my 1st review about any movie,I think Bond's Movies are somehow different than any Hollywood action movies,this character contains its own charisma and action,which isolates him with any other traditional action hero of Hollywood,but after watching Sky fall with a rating of 8.1/10, i started to think why this movie got 8,this is a traditional Hollywood action movie but it got something more special that it has no story at all,Danial Craig is pathetically wasted in this movie.Bond without gadgets is not Bond,stop making bond movies but don't don't make deteriorate this charismatic character in the hands of such Franchises which know how to deal with a bond movie.",1,9,18,18 November 2012
