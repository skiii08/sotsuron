Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This could be a great example
","I think this could be a great example to movie-makers. They could watch it and be given a real education....on how not to make a movie.True, it has a few good moments, but rub your eyes and you'll miss them completely. Whilst 'A New Hope' plunged us into the turmoil of interplanetary war and a small band of resistance fighters desperate attempts to fight back at an imperialist empire, 'Phantom Menace' introduces us to a couple of jedi knights who are off to some debate or other. Who on earth wants to go and see a sci-fi film just to watch politics, for crying out loud? Most of the central characters are irritating. There is a boring brat who tells us the best way to combat evil is to do nothing. And as for Jar Jar Binks as 'comic relief', the film already had C-3PO and R2-D2, so why did it need any more comic characters? Besides, those two droids at least served some proper function in the older films, and were kept in the background during serious parts of the story. This film takes commercialism to new lows. It is pretty obvious there are as many types of spaceship and (cartoon-like) aliens as possible in order to churn out as many toys as possible, and the film is full of scenes which are ready-made video/arcade games. The villains in this film lack any real presence. The stuttering robots are just laughable. And Count Dookya? I wonder, if 'A New Hope' had been made years later Grand Moff Tarkin would have been called Baron Froonkensteen. Worth going to see just out of curiosity, but I think only die-hard Star Wars fans will get much out of this.",3,0,1,17 December 2005
Army of Darkness," Certainly not short on action.
","Ash, from the first two Evil Dead films, is still trapped in medieval times. It seems the only way to return to the modern age is by the use of the Book of the Dead. Unfortunately it is also sought after by the deadites, the leader of whom has taken on the identity of Evil Ash. Alright, so aside from a few plot references, this is more of a follow-up to Evil Dead 2 than a sequel. But there is a lot more to it, and the story of Ash's quest to find the Book of the Dead is a genuine parody of dark-fantasy type films.Incidentally, there are at least two different endings to this film. Call me sentimental, but I much prefer the happy ending.",9,2,3,26 April 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the horror greats.
","I first saw this when I was quite young, and after that I was hooked on both Nightmare on Elm Street films and horror in general. The plot involves four teen-aged friends who find they are having nightmares about the same man, a horribly-burnt character in a red-green striped sweater and a battered old hat, wielding steel claws on a metallic glove.This is one of my favourite films and, in my view, is up there with the likes of Frankenstein, Dracula and so on. What really sets it apart from a lot of horror films of its kind is the surreal atmosphere, the well-written storyline, the genuine characters and the thin line between dreams and reality. This is one of those films which never grows old on you no matter how many times you watch it.",10,0,0,19 May 2005
