3:10 to Yuma," Drama or comedy?
","Oh dear, what a disappointment! Many great films -- not least Westerns -- require the suspension of disbelief. But on this scale? How did this film attract so much enthusiasm when it was overwhelmed by visual and spoken clichés? And you certainly didn't have to be a soothsayer to predict what was going to happen next, scene by scene. How nice it would have been to be surprised, just once.The film repeatedly pushed the boundaries of disbelief to breaking point. I mean, how did that guy manage to survive a stomach wound big enough to send a bull elephant to that great zoo in the sky? At this point, my wife turned to me and asked 'Is this supposed to be a comedy?'. Sadly, not -- at least not intentionally -- so she went off to do something more useful, muttering to herself 'it must be a boy's thing'.For those exhilarated or disappointed by 3:10 to Yuma, I urge you to see the outstanding Aussie contribution to the western genre, 'The Proposition'. Now! There's a film for grown-ups and one that won't have you shouting 'you must be joking!' at the screen.",5,0,3,20 April 2008
In Bruges," A great story, but badly executed
","Reading through some of the other reviews for In Bruges, I began to wonder if I had seen a different film.The one my wife and I saw  on DVD  had a great story, but a story that was destroyed by over-wordy, heavy-handed and unfunny dialogue and a director who seemed unsure of what he wanted the film to be. Was it supposed to be farce? Perhaps a gentle comedy? Maybe a thriller with comedy overtones? Perhaps a black comedy? Who knows? At times we felt we were watching an episode of the British TV sitcom 'Father Ted', but without the fun.As I have already stated, it was a great story, but it needed two primary changes: A script-editor with a ruthless approach to dialogue and a director with a true sense of what the film should have been.Finally, a thought: imagine what a wondrous film this would have been with the Coen Brothers at the helm.",3,4,15,24 August 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Shame! Shame!
","This is a great story, but dumbed down and splattered with dialogue and images that were a nonsense. The young actor playing the Nazi commandant's son Bruno indeed showed tremendous talent, but why was he asked to speak like an adult, rather than an eight-year-old? It was so unnecessary; so counter-productive. And how come that Shmuel, the Jewish kid in the concentration camp, was fatter than Bruno? How come the servant from the concentration camp looked better fed than the Nazi family? How come there was just a single, poorly constructed, non-electrified fence where Bruno and Shmuel met? How come there were never any guards patrolling the perimeter fence? How come in wartime did the commandant's wife have access to a seemingly endless supply of designer clothes? (And to nit-pick, where did Bruno get a modern-day, zip-up shirt?) And so the questions could go on. Not least how and why we are expected to believe how easy it would have been to penetrate the fence as the film moves towards its conclusion.To be fair, the acting was mostly excellent, though I'd loved to have seen it made in German rather than English. And I am immensely relieved – and a little surprised – that there was no cop-out with the ending. But as for the rest Oh dear.Movies often require the suspension of disbelief – never more so than in, say, the James Bond flicks – but to undermine such a serious, important, compelling story with a contemptuous approach to so many realities was seriously disappointing. Shame on you, BBC Films. Shame on you, Miramax. Shame on you, writer-director Mark Herman.",4,10,22,1 November 2009
