The King's Speech," Interesting story with wit and humour...and heart. 9.5/10
","The title of this movie is itself ambiguous...referring at once to the way the future king stammered when he spoke as well to the first speech he would have to give to his people, on the occasion of Britain declaring war against Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. So, it is a historical drama with, no doubt, some artistic licence. From the description above, one can see that it was an especially bad time for someone with a stammer to have to face up to the public duty of addressing his subjects via radio broadcasts. Long before that defining moment for King George VI (played by Colin Firth), his wife, the Duchess of York (later to be Queen Elizabeth, played by Helena Bonham Carter), seeks someone to help overcome her husband's stammer. She finds Lionel Logue (played by Geoffrey Rush), an Australian with seemingly good credentials for the task.Despite this unlikely subject for a movie, it does have wit and humour and warmth...from many of the principal characters. It also has some strong swearing at times, though this amusingly handled. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. Some of the actors provide glimpses of regality...I can believe that Helena Bonham Carter in some glimpses does indeed look like what I imagine the Duchess of York looked like in those years. She also conveys great charm and warmth...a pleasant change from the decomposing sorts she has been drawn to play in recent years. Guy Pearce as the soon to be King Edward VIII does look aristocratic in some aspects in scenes...or at least in a Hollywood kind of way.The royal couple's young daughters are pretty and nice. The actress playing the future Princess Margaret reminded me of the girl who played the daughter in the UK sitcom 'Outnumbered'. It turns out that it is the same actress. One would have been most amused if Princess Margaret in this movie had asked numerous probing questions of her father...say, during his bedtime story. Sadly, this was not to be...one would like the answers to questions such as 'What would Jesus do if he was attacked by a polar bear?'!One does get personal insight into this family...Prince Albert of York (that's the later King George VI...played by Colin Firth...still...oh do keep up!) is a very damaged human being as represented here. Some of his adventures with his brother are jaw dropping...and Geoffrey Rush's subtlety is marvellous when being told of them by Bertie (still played by Colin Firth). On the other hand, Elizabeth does tell a lovely story as to why she married Bertie...it would be nice if it were true.In a similar vein, one may be surprised to hear the slander spoken by the Duchess of York, concering the nature of Mrs. Wallis Simpson's hold over Edward, the next in line to the throne. That was not news to me, but I had forgotten it, perhaps. This may be one of those 'artistic licence' issues. Was the slander true? Or just a narky, plebian insult to hurled on to someone who dared to ignore aristocratic conventions? Interesting that the Duchess is made to voice that slander in any case.A fascinating glimpse into a bygone era. Bertie does seem to hold a modern view of the family in this movie though (he calls it 'The firm'). Ironically, he also holds atavistic views of the family, as witnessed in his reaction to Logue's suggestion that he (Bertie) could be king...a view mirrored by Edward's analysis of what Bertie is up to with his speech therapy.Lastly, this movie may even be educational for those with speech disorders...and inspiring too. There are some 'interesting' approaches to the disorder.Can't say that I've seen all the movies which have been talked about in relationship to Academy Awards, but I like Helena Bonham Carter's subtle turn as Elizabeth. It would not kill me to see Colin Firth win a Best Actor award either, but one wonders if stammering is sufficiently 'disabled' to appeal to the Academy! Geoffrey Rush would be an acceptable Best Supporting Actor too.",9,1,2,29 December 2010
Moneyball," Art vs science
","As an Australian, the thought of seeing a movie like this a few years ago would have been inconceivable...watching a movie about baseball would be on my 'things not to do' list...but watching a movie about statistics and baseball? Even more inconceivable! What changed? In the wake of Sri Lanka beating Australia (I think) in the one day cricket World Cup final many years ago (a form of the game that cricket 'purists' would no doubt deride as 'baseball' and not the 'real form' of the game...heaven knows what they now make of of the Twenty20 form of the game!), I did happen upon an article which argued that Sri Lanka had revolutionised this shortened form of the game with their batting tactics. That story intrigued me...I doubt if Sri Lanka's batting strategy was created from statistics or maths, but it was persuasively argued in the article that it had mathematical or statistical logic to it (no doubt with a big helping of common sense too).Furthermore, I had dabbled with free, customisable N.B.A. fantasy basketball leagues, where I had created two leagues with opposing philosophies...in one league, unsporting conduct was astronomically punished, whilst in the other league it was nicely rewarded. This created drafting conundrums...someone like Kobe Bryant could be a star in the fair play league...but would be a star in the foul play league. He was definitely a gamble in the fair play league though...in one year he could crush the coach's hopes, and in another year he would be a surprising star. I did get the distinct impression that coaches' who did well did so with the help of spreadsheets...to crunch the statistics...which is what this movie is all about. Before I start the review proper, I'll just mention that I may have been roped into joining someone's fantasy baseball league as a quid pro quo for them joining my league...just found the whole language of baseball gobbledygook...and never really hung around that sport for long. It's a good thing that this movie was not geared to those fans who love the gobbledygook (be it something called ERAs or whatever it's called).Based on a true story, this movie outlines the revolutionary approach to selecting a baseball team for the major league in the wake of having your star players bought for large sums of money by cashed up teams. That's a major theme of the movie...the underdog against an unfair system. The approach taken contrasts that taken in Australia for the game of Australian rules football (AFL), where a form of 'socialism' was instituted over a decade ago, I think, with 'equalised' drafting, priority picks and salary caps. This 'socialism' has seen a diversity of teams win the sport's major trophy. Perhaps the main character in this movie, Billy Beane, might have been content with such a system.Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, and it is striking how much Brad seems to be growing into Robert Redford's face as he ages. Billy is the general manager of an underfunded (by cashed up teams' standards) baseball team, the Oakland Athletics. As in many sports where distorted markets rule (e.g. European soccer, where American multi-billionaires borrow huge sums of money and buy famous teams and load them up with debt...which is fine...until the bubble burst and the teams might face bankruptcy...or, where Russian oil billionaires buy teams and eat into their own cash reserves, paying insane salaries for stars. In both cases, there really is no business model, apart from paying crazy money which you either do or do not have for purpose of winning trophies), Oakland has developed some players into stars...only to see them picked off by cashed up teams.Pitt plays Beane in the charismatic/brash way that Orson Welles played the youthful and exuberant 'Citizen' Kane, and he does a nice line in sizing people up and yet biting his tongue or taking sly amusement from their ways. This is interesting due to the history of Beane...he was seen as a potential star of the game and he does carry around some of that baggage with him at times. His experience illustrates the art vs science approach to baseball...he was drafted due to the former and he has to butt heads with his recruitment department in his new role as the team's general manager in order to bring a more scientific approach to recruiting.Peter Brand plays Jonah Hill, a smart draft by Beane, who recognises in this geek a man capable of revolutionising the thinking of his recruitment department. Peter/Jonah is the most unathletic man you could imagine...short of someone who would require a crane to take them out of their bedroom by a hole in the roof in order to be taken to a hospital. He's like me playing fantasy N.B.A...or that man in the Matrix who sees everything in terms of binary digits...even that beautiful woman in a red dress.For people who enjoy watching the game of baseball on the big screen, the last half hour has some nice moments for them. What makes this film more interesting for a general audience though is the intriguing insight into the backroom discussions of an elite sporting team. How players are valued and reasons why they may not be valued more highly are discussed.In some ways this story is like those horse racing stories where someone buys a horse for under a $1,000 which was destined for the knacker's yard, but it goes on to win a fortune. You do get the equivalent of horses bound for the knacker's yard in this movie, as far as the baseball players who are recruited by Beane.There was a scene I liked in this movie, where reporters discussed who was responsible for the team's turnaround...it was all attributed to the coach...which was in contrast to the tale that the movie tells.A well told story which did make me laugh on occasion.",9,12,15,14 November 2011
The Avengers," Entertaining and funny movie. 77.5%
","I can't say that I was that keen to see this movie, even with Joss Whedon's name attached to it - a man who has had a career in reverse, with his 'Buffy the vampire' TV series coming across as the culmination of a career in the industry, whilst other TV series of his that I've seen not reaching those heights - but the good reviews for the film made me change my mind. This is a movie which is as superhero movies should be...a rollicking spectacle. Generally I'm pretty selective about what superhero movies I watch (haven't seen the 'Captain America' outing as...I'm not American...jingoism doesn't sit well with me). Also, I tend to jump off a franchise pretty quickly too...Iron Man 2 was so-so, so I probably won't watch the next instalment. It will be interesting to see if this series can maintain the levels of the original. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments for me in it (I did see 'Thor' due to some amusing clips in a movie review TV show...but the clips showed the funniest bits...and they weren't as funny in the context of the movie). No doubt Joss Whedon's time on 'Buffy the vampire slayer' was invaluable in crafting the kind of comedy that works so well in this movie...hopefully the runaway success of this movie may see Joss given the chance to make a sequel to 'Serenity'...I want to see what that kick-arse chick is capable of!...I think the actress' name is Summer Glau...I'm not sure if Whedon has an intention to make a sequel to that movie, which was based on his okay TV series 'Firefly'.Anyway, the plot concerns Thor's younger brother Loki obtaining a device which can see him seize control of the Earth, via an unholy alliance with some ugly looking villains...and it's not clear who has the better end of that particular bargain. One of the biggest laughs I got was with Thor's comment about his relationship with Loki, after a comrade of his lists Loki's 'achievements'. Nick Fury has to assemble a team of superheroes in order to tackle Loki's allies...and there are some heavy hitters...the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America...then a guy and a chick...if you don't lump Captain America in with the 'B' team. The fight with Loki's allies - when it comes - is impressive. It was after finding some blockbuster franchises became ho-hum for me that I got a real kick out of the 'new wave' of superhero movies...like 'Hancock' and 'Kick-Ass'. They were the perfect antidote to when blockbuster sequels were merely lame attempts to cash in on a superior original. Time will tell if The Avengers falls into the same trap...and if it does, it's a pity that Chloë Moretz is now too old to have that same wonderful impact that she did as Hit-Girl in 'Kick-Ass'. Anyway, if Joss is onboard for the sequels to this film, I'm onboard...for at least one more time!I saw this movie in 3D in Xtreme screen. Didn't find the 3D particularly spectacular...parts of the movie are in regular 2D too.Just by the by...I'm not that familiar with Norse mythology or whathaveyou...but I do find Thor's hammer rather lame, in an amusing kind of way...it's sort of like his handbag or something. Is it Louis Vuitton?Lastly...this movie being called 'The Avengers', when I heard the name, I was expecting it to be about Steed and Purdie! Or Steed and Emma Peel...if I was older!",8,1,4,1 May 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Playful and with even more outrageous and preposterous action. 77.5%
","Tarantino seems to be in an even more playful mood with 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' than he was in the first one, after opening his sequel with a replay of the dying bride sequence of 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1'. For instance, The Bride narrates straight to the camera and at the audience. She even ups the ante with comments like: 'What the movie advertisements refer to as 'a roaring rampage of revenge''. Is she talking about the movie 'Kill Bill'? or merely likening her situation to that of such movies in general? Such playfulness seems to me to take the edge off some of the disturbing imagery in this movie...like the kinds of horrors that you only see in cartoons...the kind that is parodied in The Simpson's cartoon within a cartoon 'The Itchy and Scratchy show'. Such horrors are rendered dreamlike or, more accurately, perhaps, like a daydream or fantasy. Where to draw the line between what is in real in the movie and what is fake becomes more fraught when The Bride makes the viewer an accomplice to her 'roaring rampage' by saying 'the one I'm driving to right now, the only one I have left'. Again, this seems to erase the line between film and reality...movies don't talk back to you, do they? It's the film purporting to be real...you are there, with The Bride...sitting on the bonnet of her car...as she drives along a highway to mete out her next act of revenge!The other notable thing about this movie, going on my notes, are the inside jokes. For instance, Tarantino had me going with the books one of his characters was reading, i.e. 'The Carrucan's of Kurrajong'. Like me, Tarantino has a mistaken apostrophe. Anyway, I looked up this book just now and learned its provenance. The books just sounds like a real book...I'm pretty sure that there would be an Australian book with a not dissimilar title!Self-referential humour also plays a part in this film. For instance, Bill has a brand of bread called 'Blanco Bimbo'. The Bride is sometimes addressed as 'kiddo' too...which has a payoff later in the film.Watching the movie and the end credits, Tarantino seems to be providing the viewer with a syllabus to follow-up on: two characters watch 'Shogun assassin' together, for instance. A Charles Bronson movie poster adorns one character's caravan, I think. Not sure if it's this movie or the first one (perhaps both?) which also gives a nod to Charles Bronson in the end credits. Some nostalgia was brought up for me too...I'd forgotten that the cartoon series 'Heckle and Jeckle' existed, but Tarantino reminded me!For those who enjoy Tarantino's pop cultural riffs, he has a good one concerning superheroes and their alter-egos.Some notes to self:* Bill says 'Ah so' a couple of times in the film, I think...not sure if that is a nod to David Carradine's starring role in 'Kung fu' many decades ago.* The pianist at the church is described as a 'drell'...I've only heard that word with relation to a character in the sci-fi game 'Mass Effect 2', the word 'bar-kay' is also used. Not sure what they mean here! Just looked up the latter phrase...the pianist was in a real life band of that name? Hmm...see my point earlier about blurring the line between fiction and reality!* Bill makes a comment to the effect that B wears the costume of Arlene...and...I shouldn't have used an abbreviation in my notes! Not sure who the 'B' refers too...probably The Bride...and I'm guessing that 'Arlene' was a fake name she used at her wedding rehearsal.As with the first movie, from memory, I was toying with what score to give this movie...I think scoring this sequel 75% was on the cards but I liked how it played out, so I settled on a higher score so that I'd give it 8 out of 10, since this site doesn't give half stars.Lastly, if you like playful movies like this, I'd also recommend the horror movie 'In the mouth of madness' and the sci-fi movie 'The thirteenth floor'.",8,1,2,26 January 2016
Changeling," A powerful, harrowing true story which makes your blood boil
","Having overcome my reluctance to watch this movie (as I thought it would be profoundly depressing), I must say how rewarding and informative it was. Based on a true story of a mum (Christine Collins, played by Angelina Jolie) who is convinced to work on her day off, leaving her young son (Walter Collins, played by Gattlin Griffith) at home, alone, only to return later that night to find him missing. The rest of the story is an absolute nightmare. Christine must deal with a corrupt police force which is more interested in good press than good outcomes for victims of crime.Set in 1920's Los Angeles, attention to period detail is excellent, it seems to me. One of the ways that this movie is informative is in how it shows Los Angeles to be a spitting image of those present day, corrupt South American cities where the only thing worse than gang violence is...police violence. The revelations about police conduct in this era is jaw-dropping. Other revelations about civil institutions are also frightening.The cast in this movie is uniformly strong and effective. One of my reasons for being reluctant to see this movie was seeing excerpts on movie review shows on TV where John Malkovich's character, Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb was shown. He seemed really weird in excerpts, but watching the movie, he comes across a lot better, being a staunch ally of Christine in her dealings with the L.A.P.D.In the header, I mentioned that this is a movie which makes your blood boil. The main reason for that is just glimpsing how the city's powerful and elites function. Of course, your blood can boil so much that you don't give credit to the actors who push all your buttons and make you fume with outrage. Actors like Jeffrey Donovan, who plays Capt. J.J. Jones, and Colm Feore, who plays Chief James E. Davis. Other sundry characters who Christine encounters are similarly infuriating. As someone who lives in somewhat more enlightened times than Christine did, it's shocking to see how her case was handled, back in the day.Captain J.Jones is perhaps the most ghastly specimen of humanity in the movie. He is so narcissistic and selfish that his own incompetence (at best) does not register with him. It's doubtful I've ever seen a character who is more of a man-child than him.My blood hasn't boiled this much since I saw 'Capturing the Friedmans', a docu which also deals in crime and justice. The subject of that docu is morally ambivalent in a way in which Christine Collins isn't, but the conduct of the police against him is just as troublesome. There is also a brilliant Australian mini-series with similar themes of crime and justice in 'Through my eyes', which was also based on a true story.No doubt the facts of the story have been embellished and even fabricated no doubt, to increase the drama, but I have no doubt that the real facts of the case are sufficient for a powerful movie. It would be a pity if some fabrications have been made in order to make the Collins' family seem more heroic than they actually were-I do not think that they would be lesser subjects for a movie if they hadn't done half of what they are depicted of doing in this movie.Director Clint Eastwood has another movie out around the same time as this one, 'Gran Torino'. 'Changeling' is the superior movie in my view...'Gran Torino' is just average. Am not sure if 'Changeling' was up for Academy Awards in 2008-if it was released in time for that year's awards, I feel that it was definitely a contender for 'Best Picture' amongst other awards. If it was released after the cut-off date for that year's awards, then I feel that it must be a contender for 'Best Picture' in 2009, along with 'Watchmen'.Although the movie does not go into the ultimate fate of the 'changeling' of the title, the last we see of him just increases the number of unanswered questions the movie raises. A post-script to this aspect of the movie would have been appreciated. A meeting between Christine and a man with knowledge of her son's fate also seemed a proper subject for a footnote...I mean, I'm not sure that this meeting really took place, so this man's story could have been dealt with by a post-script to the story.A great movie.",10,3,4,24 March 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A better move to the big screen than with 'Ali G'
","A shameless remake of the vastly superior American movie 'Dubya: Cultural learnings of Iraqistan for make benefit glorious nation of U.S and A', this movie was, in any case, perhaps the funniest movie of that year...or at least one of the two funniest movies of that year.Borat, like Dubya in the earlier movie, is one of those gormless innocent abroad types...always putting his foot in his mouth or acting inappropriately. 'Borat' doesn't have a classic scene like 'Dubya' has (who could ever forget that achingly funny scene where the military police come looking for the draft dodger Dubya but can't find him, as he is hiding under his bed? Of course, when Dubya comes crawling out from under his bed and utters his by now trademark catch-phrase 'Mission accomplished', does the whole cinema fall about laughing helplessly) but it has many moments that approach the former movie's hilarity.For instance-when Borat stays at a Jewish American family's bed and breakfast and expresses patently absurd beliefs about them. For many people, the funniest scene is the gross out moment when Borat unintentionally engages in a '69' type position with a morbidly obese man.This is a very funny but provocative and ill-mannered pseudo-documentary about a bigoted foreigner in the US. Of course, that he gets away with his dreadful behavior reflects badly on the real Americans he encounters (most of the people in this movie are not actors but real people/dupes). In fact, the truly dreadful people are the ones Borat encounters, not him, as he's not exactly real, is he?This is writer/performer Sacha Baron Cohen at his best. I think he has brought his TV show ('Da Ali G show') to life on the big screen with this movie. It's a real shame that his first effort on the big screen ('Ali G indahouse') was a dud for straying from the elements which made his TV show so good...interaction with real people.This movie is hilarious but not for the squeamish or easily (or uneasily) offended.",8,3,4,3 July 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Solid action/thriller. 77.5%
","I watched this movie on DVD yesterday (Saturday, at the time of writing), after having seen the sequel, 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol', and not remembering certain developments in the main character's (Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise) life. I know that I'd seen the first two movies...must have missed this third one...perhaps because I didn't like its predecessor that much...or something (I watched the 4th in the series because the cinema chain showing it gave you the chance to win a car if you booked a ticket online...ah, marketing!).Anyway, this movie does indeed fill in the missing pieces from the 4th in the series. It concerns a romantically entangled Ethan Hunt no longer working in the field for the IMF organisation (his love interest's reaction to what that acronym stands for pretty much spoke for me!) and now working there part time as a trainer of would be field agents. Of course, the IMF comes calling on him again to help out in a mission to rescue an agent he trained who has been kidnapped (the beautiful Keri Russell as field agent Lindsey Farris...the IMF seems to have impossibly high beauty standards for new recruits!).Predictably, things go pear shaped and soon Ethan Hunt has to deal with a mysterious, shadowy figure called Owen Davian (played coldly and malevolently by Philip Seymour Hoffman...a chilling performance as a truly nasty piece of work). Davian is seeking to sell something of unimaginable value...and possibly something of great power.The best thrills/tension comes from when Ethan is stretched to his limits trying to save the women he cares for.The beautiful Michelle Monaghan perhaps has a thankless role (unless she had posters of Tom on her wall while growing up!) playing Ethan's love interest, Julia Meade. She is suitably adorable.Watching this movie I did get some odd moments with it...where I wasn't engrossed in the proceedings...like: * Ethan Hunt cracking a smile near the end of the movie...no doubt that is the 'money shot' for Tom Cruise's female fans...I can imagine the director wheedling that out of him with a 'Come on Tom! Show us those pearly whites!'.* Near the end of the movie, there's a moment which comes across as comedic, concerning some extraordinary measure which must be taken to stop Ethan from dying...maybe everyone knows it's all a bit silly, really, but maybe Tom just doesn't pull off those many moments where he has to emote in this movie...his expression in that scene comes across as something from a teen comedy.To close, the DVD I watched has some extras, including deleted scenes. There was a good action scene missing from the movie, featuring the beautiful Maggie Q as Ethan's field agent partner Zhen Lei. Hmm...I was watching a scene in the Vatican in the movie...she wears a very revealing dress...I played a scene slowly where she reaches for an item hidden near her leg...something struck me as 'weird'...had a look higher up on Zhen's body...the 'weird' thing was her underwear! I sort of got the impression that she had been digitally altered in some way...haven't seen Basic Instinct...but I was thinking in that direction...don't think anything was digitally altered though...it's just that in trying not have distracting underwear for the actress it actually proved a distraction! Watching the making of featurette did also remind me of another couple of instances I utilised the slow motion ability of my machine...there are two scenes where Ethan and Lindsey pirouette together in action sequences...apparently Tom went for that ostentatious move...it definitely does catch the eye though. It also seems that a middle aged, behind the scenes woman who is interviewed is not credited...have no idea who she was!",8,4,5,21 January 2012
Source Code," Brilliant concept. Great execution. A sci-fi classic.
","Another in a longish line of high-concept mainstream movies. In many of those movies it's fashionable to have a confusing story which people will interpret as being brilliant/genius and which has an in-built 'repeat' viewing factor due to the baffling nature of the story which has just been told. Think movies like 'Inception'.'Source code' is a far superior film to 'Inception' but will probably lack the kudos of the latter. Briefly, the story concerns a commuter ('Colter Stevens', played by Jake Gyllenhaal) on a train who has an identity crisis. Before he can resolve it, he dies with all the other passengers in a massive explosion. Afterwards (!), the man awakes in a weird chamber where he is questioned by military (or some such) personnel about who caused the explosion. Don't worry, this is not a 'spoiler'...it's established very early on in the movie that this is what has happened. Of course, you get questions along the lines of 'Which reality is real?'. Going with the sci-fi explanation (involving secret military experiments) you have a plausibility to the scenario which is very nicely unambitious and may in fact have some science (perhaps speculative) to it...involving information retained in the brain post-death...some 8 minutes...which gives rise to another gimmick of the movie...the character reliving those 8 minutes in order to solve the mystery of the train explosion. The latter part of the scenario may be hard to rationalise as remotely plausible, but I just ran with the premise...perhaps it might have been a more plausible story if the movie didn't go down that path...a more 'realistic' science fiction, perhaps.This is a great story which seems to have no loose ends to it, at least on one level...the film makers provide you with clues as to what is happening and you aren't left high and dry like similarly themed movies can do. P.S. on reflection, the part of the movie dealing with 'reliving' the 8 minutes of memory in the way that they did, did strike me as being a loose-end/plot-hole...but you just enjoy he ride at the time.A lovely, dark, morbid fantasy.If you like this movie, some movies etc. with similar themes include:12 Monkeys (film) The matrix (film) Dark city (film) Groundhog day (film) Assassin's Creed (video game...personally I don't find the first game in the series to be fun to play...the sequel is much more playable).",10,2,4,17 May 2011
Skyfall," A quite straight Bond. 82.5+%
","This movie plays as a more drama orientated franchise outing but it doesn't do away with the humour the series is known for. So, you can include this movie in the category of more 'serious' Bond movies. It's a solid entry in the Bond franchise but I'm not sure that it will have the same 'repeat viewing' attraction of some of the fluffier instalments. That being said, it is one of the best movies of the series, but I'm sure on repeat viewing the unusual endgame will drag for some, although it doesn't really on first viewing.My memory of Bond movies isn't so great, but there's probably other Bond movies which have this kind of plot to it...criminal mastermind wreaks havoc with super spy James Bond's employer, MI6.In this case, the criminal mastermind is Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem). His entrance is actually delayed in the movie and if you hadn't of been bombarded by the film's pre-publicity, you could miss his first appearance...he's quite self-effacing. There is much fun to be had when Raoul met James for the first time. Dare I say that Daniel Craig (James Bond) wasn't acting when he looked very uncomfortable in his presence? Awkward! Anyway, in previous Bond movies, I'm sure that Raoul would be really camp...but here he is insane yet full of pathos at times. I'm kind of hoping that there is a deleted scene of Raoul waggling his hips and finger and saying something like 'Nuh uh!'. I was kind of expecting that to happen in any case! To the movie's credit, Raoul has a very detailed back story so he's more than just a cardboard villain.The action sequences are impressive here...quite the Hollywood style spectacle, but maybe the franchise has those at ten a penny, so I didn't find them as incredible as in some earlier films...I'm probably just getting old! If I can have a little gripe here...Daniel Craig's running style...touch of the Forrest Gumps to it!One thing I did find odd about this movie was some lines either James Bond himself says or other characters say to him. Odd in the sense that they didn't seem as believable coming from him/them as they would of, say, in Roger Moore's last movie as James Bond, 'A view to a kill'. I just don't think of Daniel Craig's Bond being in the same boat as Roger Moore's Bond in his final movie.Adele's title track is amiable enough but it suffers from having a non-word shoehorned into the lyrics. I like other Bond themes more and even some with silly phrases in them (e.g. 'Goldfinger') could at least be justified on the basis that it was an actual name in the movie. If Adele wasn't contractually required to use the title of the film in her song, it might have been more alluring.The ending of the movie suggests to me that the future of Craig's Bond may lie in direct remakes of earlier Bond movies...ones starring Sean Connery, for example. So, I could imagine 'Dr. No' being next cab off the rank in the Bond franchise...or 'On her majesty's secret service'. If that's right, I could quite enjoy that...Connery's earliest Bond movies didn't seem very modern...they seem dated, even for the time.One of the best Bond movies.",8,1,8,6 December 2012
50 First Dates," A warm romantic comedy after a very quesy start
","It's a good thing I stuck with this movie as the first 15 or so minutes (really, up until the love story starts and we see the lovely/always cute Drew Barrymore appear) are just awful. In fact, I considered switching channels when this was shown on commercial TV the other week. The reason it was so bad? The comedy was pitched at a level suitable for primary school children. Perhaps that is the norm for Adam Sandler comedies (I don't watch movies with him in it merely for the fact that he is in it...hence I haven't seen too many Sandler movies). It's as if Sandler, perhaps, didn't trust the script and insisted on low-brow, juvenile prat-falls and gross out humour be included. If it was intended to appeal to kids, then it is very surprising that in one scene Sandler's character Henry drops the 'F bomb' in front of some primary school aged kids. The 'F' word isn't really suitable for kids, you wouldn't think...and a love story might not appeal to them either.So, if I had bailed on the movie early on, I'd have been forced to rate it 0 stars or a very generous 1 star. Fortunately, I soldiered on and the movie changed in nature...into something more watchable.The premise of the movie has 'high concept' written all over it: it draws on an actual medical condition-one in which a person has no longer any long term memory. To explain: just imagine that you get a knock to the head one day and you wake up the next day not being able to remember anything new-not after a while in any case. So, you could remember what you already knew before the knock to the head, but nothing afterwards...well, you could, but you'd forget it after a few short hours or whathaveyou.So, serial womaniser and liar Henry Roth (Adam Sandler), has to try and woo a woman who he finds irresistible but who can't remember any positive impressions he has made the day before...or even remember him.This movie has its heart in the right place. Not exactly plausible but nonetheless charming and at times poignant, mainly due to the lovely Barrymore. It's a rom-com, so criticising it for not being plausible is a tad ungenerous.",6,0,0,4 July 2008
Hereditary," This family is uniquely unhappy. 65+%
","Having heard good things about this film on Australian ABC radio (across multiple programmes or segments), I thought I'd watch this. Since I don't really watch commercial TV, I haven't seen any ads for this film, so I'll keep my description of what happens rather vague, so as to not to divulge any spoilers for you. The plot involves the aftermath of the death of the mother of Annie Graham (Toni Collette). As Annie says in her eulogy at the funeral service for her mum, Ellen was a 'secretive' woman. There are a lot of interesting titbits about Ellen for the rest of the film, as well as for Annie's fraught relationship with her own family (husband Steve, played by Gabriel Byrne, nearly adult teenage son Peter, played by Alex Wolff and their 13-year-old daughter Charlie, played by Milly Shapiro). There are hints of the supernatural in this film and it made me wonder how the rest of the film would unspool...would it be a supernatural horror film or psychological thriller? In either case, the film chooses to reach its conclusion at a funereal pace, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but may not appeal to those who cleave to the fast and easy thrills of Hollywood fare. Some films which 'Hereditary' brought to mind in terms of pace, characterisation or visuals included 'Rosemary's baby', 'Pan's labyrinth' and the rather good if obscure Australian film 'Summerfield'. The first and the last film could be considered good companion pieces to 'Hereditary', although I wasn't that keen on 'Rosemary's baby' but did quite like 'Summerfield'. Those other films aren't fresh in my memory and I don't mean to suggest that they are very similar to 'Hereditary'...I just find that there's a certain 'family resemblance' to them...cousins, so to speak. If you don't mind films which unfold at a measured pace, there is value in viewing each of them. Oh...just remembered...the original 'The wicker man' is worth mentioning as a 'cousin' of these films. That being said, there are a couple of gruesome scenes in 'Hereditary', so the film isn't devoid of some shock value for the unwary. It should also be noted that there is some artifice in 'Hereditary'. For instance, the Graham family is introduced to us via a cinematic device, which did make me wonder what implications that had for what we were about to see. Similarly, there is a scene with a very odd camera angle when showing Annie in a hallway. Maybe you could view that cinematic device as 'Hitchcockian'...and maybe you could also say that it alluded to a later scene with Annie at her home. I also liked the narrative titbits in this film which made me wish that I could rewind the film at the cinema to listen again to some comment or to pause a scene so that I could try and recognise certain symbols or strange objects. Speaking of which, there is also a novel visual cinematic device in this film to bring to the viewer's attention something uncanny occurring.  No spoiler here, but as for the ending, my initial impression was that it had a mystifying conviction, which, in retrospect, I no longer think is accurate. Tongue-in-cheek, you could perhaps say that the ending of the film follows naturally on from the mystifying psychedelic end-sequence of '2001: A space odyssey'.  Not really a criticism, but I did wonder how the events of the film all cohered to bring you the resolution that is revealed. Were the events leading up to it inevitable? I.e. was the fate of the key character at the end of the film 'ordained' from the outset, so to speak? This kind of question is what made 'Summerfield' such a good film, in my view (I've reviewed that title here, as I have 'Rosemary's baby' and 'Pan's labyrinth' (which I see that I gave a score of 10/10 to. 'Summerfield' got 8/10 from me and 'Rosemary's baby' got 6/10 from me). Still on the ending...I'm wondering how scary that outcome was, considering the domestic nature of much of the preceding drama. I would tend to think that maybe the resolution wasn't as scary at it was (perhaps) intended to be, assuming the ending was intended to be interpreted literally...which it may or may not have been, in any case!Random observations:* The actors playing the children aren't your typical Hollywood film teenagers, visually. Peter didn't even seem to have a family resemblance to Annie and Steve, in which case the casting is a bit odd in that respect...or is it? I dunno!* Maybe there could have been a bit more chills immediately following the wake for Annie's mum, relating to her, before the themes of Annie's loss and grief unspool.* What was that stuff about the black dots or whatever it was which Annie had on her finger? Or the bit where she touches her mum's corpse at the wake? Hmm.* On one film review segment on ABC local radio the reviewer did mention that he thought that Toni Collette could (would?) win an Academy Award for her performance. Toni Collette does get to display scenes of extreme grief, so that may catch the eye of the voters, perhaps.* An interesting reaction from Peter following a shocking event. In a way it was unbelievable and in another way, it was entirely believable.P.S. I'm a big fan of 'The exorcist', which is another film which does a great job in building tension and not rushing into its shocks. 10/10 from me and also reviewed at this site by me.P.P.S. ...and now I'm wondering how the film's title fits into its meaning...",7,1,2,28 June 2018
Rocketman," Daniel Radcliffe and Harry Potter are all growed up and transformed into Elton John. 75%
","This is the truthy story of Elton John (the pop-rock musical phenomenon who composed the song 'Rocket man', from which this film takes its title), from his time as a young boy who turned out to be a child prodigy on the piano, to the coda where we find out where Elton is at in his life right now. Like a Hollywood (or Bollywood, going on one scene in this film!) musical, the cast often breaks out into song - Elton's, naturally! - with various cast members singing, usually Taron Egerton, playing Elton, as well as other actors sharing the vocal duties with him. Mostly you hear fragments of songs, so be aware that you won't be hearing the original recordings as sung by Elton himself.Often in this film I would be wondering: 'Did that really happen?'. Seeing that Elton and his partner are listed as producers, I would hope that much of the dialogue which made me take notice did, in fact, take place. By 'made me take notice', I mean comments made to or by Elton, which were especially cutting or what have you. They could be read as being particularly telling or illuminating about the people involved.Often in this film it's quite obvious that what is depicted did not happen, which is why I say that the story has a 'truthy' quality to it. In fact, there are moments when magic realism is deployed...to good effect, at times. One such time involves Elton's first performance (from memory), in the US. Perhaps at the end of the film, an actual photograph of that performance is shown, which would naturally lead to the magical realism treatment of that moment. On a related matter, I remember years ago seeing a photo of a Buddhist man, I assume, levitating off the ground. The photo would have been presented as actually depicting that. However, many years later (and ago), I saw footage, I believe, of something of that sort. The video gives the lie to the saying 'the camera never lies'! Spookily, having looked up that phrase just now, I see that it is also the title of a song by Elton!Another example of the 'truthy' element to this film...I'd wonder if Elton really did write a song at a certain point in time. Then I'd hear a song which I KNEW was definitely not of that era! Sticklers for accuracy, you have been warned! It's magic realism, people!There is one scene where Elton is kissed by an African American music artist, before Elton had begun his solo career. I wondered if that really happened. Was it true, or truthy? Since I've been aware that Elton mostly composed the music to his songs (and not the lyrics), I also wondered if he really did write the lyrics to 'Your song', which the film gives the impression that he did. Even though that song isn't a favourite of mine, I must say that it evoked the most powerful emotional response in me of any scene in this film. Not affecting me quite so much, but I did note a moment in Elton's final therapy session, where he is asked a question which he has often asked himself. That was also moving, but I can't say that it made a lot of sense to me in the context of this film, as I didn't get the sense that this was a relationship in which it was germane to express that sentiment. Perhaps that sense could have been better expressed in the film? Maybe. In fact, there's one scene where Elton comments about how he feels about himself. Again, the film didn't show to me that Elton was feeling that way.In any case, one of the themes of this film is how we perceive ourselves and what we imagine that people expect of us. Elton's private life, as shown in the film, could be viewed as a performance piece of what Elton imagined what was expected of him, as far as relationships and his persona went.Told in broad-brush strokes and seemingly covering every dot point of Elton's life (not that I'd know), it did occur to me at the time, or after seeing the film, that I wished that we got to know Elton better, as the film often functions as a snapshot of his life. For instance:* What happened to Elton's piano studies at the Royal Academy of Music?* Who were his early childhood friends?* What was his first relationship? If that was shown in the film, why not delve deeper into it?* The film seems to imply that Elton made an immediate musical impact. I don't think that he did. I would have liked to have seen some scenes concerning this.* Elton's relationship and marriage to a woman is briefly covered. The scene dealing with their married life was quite telling. Was it like that from day one, though?* Elton mentions how promiscuous he was during one therapy session. There's nothing in the film to back that up.* Elton's last marriage appears to be off limits, apart from some (literal) snapshots of his partner). It seems that Elton is being very protective of his privacy here...but maybe also throughout the film?I suppose that my major criticism of this film is that what Elton says, for example, isn't clearly seen in the film, as is the case for his feelings for his manager. It therefore surprises to hear him say that.Miscellaneous:* Elton accounted for 5% of all records sales at one point, it's stated.* I think that the real Elton gives one of the all-time great rock vocal performances in 'Saturday night's all right'. Wouldn't trade him for Plant or Mercury et. al!* Sometimes Egerton reminds me of Elton (as opposed to Radcliffe!).* The trailer for this film seems to have a scene that I didn't see in the film, where a receptionist, I think, says to Reginald: 'That's my grandad's name!'.",7,0,1,5 July 2019
Gravity," The dark side of the moon...77.5%
","This is a highly unusual film to come out of America and be on mainstream release. It's pretty much what a bad day at the office would like for astronauts...and of course, it's pretty bleak. Hollywood 'names' George Clooney and Sandra Bullock star as astronauts orbiting Earth on a space shuttle. Disaster strikes. Who will live? Who will die? Will anyone survive?Bullock looks very unglamorous in this movie...until she gets most of her gear off and then...man, is her next role as a world class athlete or gymnast or something? Don't tell me that she went all 'method' to play the part of an astronaut! Um, astronauts don't look so fit! Not sure if I actually saw her bum...could have sworn she had an anvil where her buttocks should be.In favour of this movie is genuine tension as both the astronauts and their means of escape become endangered. I watched this in 3D and I actually blinked a few times as debris hurtled towards me. Bullock's character has the most fleshed out backstory (unlike her buttocks) which adds to the existential angst of the situation that they face and her will to survive.One minor gripe I had about this film was during one scene where time is of the essence and Clooney's character is just very chatty with Bullock's character...despite mentioning to her the urgency of time. All the time he was talking to her and she wasn't actually heading where she should be going I kept thinking 'Seriously? Come on! MOVE IT!'.There was an old scientific theory which posited that all of space was filled with 'aether' (maybe last year I browsed a scientific magazine which had some speculative science that something akin to the concept may be revived...in 'Scientific American'? I don't remember) and I just mention this to note the heavy use of symbolism in this movie. The astronauts floating about in the aether look rather like foetuses floating in amniotic fluid with an umbilical cord. There is an even more marked (yet subtle) image of Sandra's character floating inside a space station in a foetal position. These kinds of images suggest that there is some kind of deeper parallel being made by the film. Can't say that I put my finger on what it was - if it does indeed exist - I did wonder if maybe this was some kind of origin story for humanity...implying that our species had its origins in outer space and came to colonise Earth...which is actually a current hypothesis in physics, I believe...people like Pr. Paul Davies, I think, believing that the 'seeds of life' are present everywhere across the universe and so life may form wherever there is fertile ground to land on.But then again, maybe the symbolism in the movie is just nice imagery without such speculation going on. Must also note how excellent the simulation of weightlessness in this movie is...it looks real.",8,0,2,24 October 2013
Citizen Kane," One of the most charismatic performances of all time
","As a teenager, I saw a copy of this movie in a video store and seeing as the jacket sleeve had some high praise for this movie, I watched it. It's hard to say how my perceptions of this movie may have been influenced by the blurb on the VHS cover.The start of this old black and white movie is quite disorientating-a newsreel tells of the death of a powerful media tycoon in the US. You wonder if you have gotten the right movie, or the movie is something different to what you thought it would be.Soon, you get a more conventional narrative movie-the story of the tycoon in question...the Kane of the title. One of the hooks of the movie is the whole 'what does 'Rosebud' mean?' aspect of the story. It was Kane's last words before he died, and it nags away at you until it is resolved towards the end of the movie (pay attention to the movie for the resolution of this aspect of the myster!). Many years later I found out that the word 'rosebud' has a whole OTHER connotation, to do with a REAL media tycoon whom this movie was loosely based on (there is a documentary concerning this real tycoon's attempts to shut down the making/screening of this movie).If you've done Media Studies, you might have had to watch this movie and there you learn about all the technical achievements of this movie. That's all fine, but this movie has a narrative and performance charm all of its own.A scene from this movie is one of my all time favourites from any movie-it's the scene where a hugely charismatic Kane (as played by the youngish Orson Welles) outlines how long his business can stay afloat for despite incurring losses. This is a brash, lovable, charismatic American character. Great scene-alongside say, one scene with Robert de Niro in the otherwise mediocre Mean Streets, or that of Noah Taylor in 'He died with a felafel in his hand'. All these have a great scene where their character reveals themselves, emotionally speaking.Many other scenes from this movie will leave an impression with you.A movie about power and love.",9,1,3,19 June 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Like a Jewish daydream...
","In some ways this seems a movie written by committee, hence the ending. As the Irish might say: 'To be sure, to be sure to be sure'. Even though Adolf Hitler died at his own hands over 60 years ago, Tarantino's movie is a testament to the feelings that he invokes, decades later. Yes, this movie is entertaining, but is it cathartic for Jews, this kind of fantasy? Or is the emptiness of the daydream something that might just make them more impotently angry and uncomfortable in their skin? For non-Jews, I think that Hitler may just be a fairytale like villain...interchangeable and have the appropriate, vague pop-cultural cache of a dark icon. Perhaps he no longer has the hold on the rest of the world as he will always have for Jews. Still, a movie with Hitler and a target on his back? Yeah, why not? Sounds like fun!Brad Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine, a man who, like Indianna Jones might say, 'hates Nazis'. He leads a team of Jewish commando types who make it their mission to drop into Nazi occupied France and start huntin' Nazis, and instilling fear into them by how they kill them. So, you should be warned, there are a few scenes where Nazis meet their doom in brutal ways, and others have their skin violated in horrific ways. It's just a few scenes, and they don't dwell on the horror, but you should know that the camera doesn't blink when these horrors are perpetrated on the Nazis.Raine, as played by Pitt, is a caricature, amusingly done. He's at his embarrassing and awkward best in a scene inside a cinema where he draws on his knowledge of the Italian language. Good stuff, that. Pitt was embarrassing in a bad way in the movie 'Troy', specifically the scene where he meets Hector's father after a battle. It was meant to be drama but Pitt played that scene wrong, in my opinion. In a Tarantino movie, it's hard to imagine anybody being capable of playing a character or a scene 'wrong'. It's all good.This movie is also quite postmodern...it's playful, with some scenes having something analagous to a hyperlink....so, if 'realism' is your thing, these intrusions into 'reality' may grate. But if you like realism, there are plenty of other aspects that will annoy you even more.Another 'fun' character is Col. Hans Landa, played by Christoph Waltz. In a realistic drama he would come across the buffoon at times, but in Tarantino's world he is astute, menacing and...a lot of fun too. Landa is Raine's main nemesis. He is a senior Nazi who has the job of finding French Jewish citizens who are unaccounted for/missing. His performance has intensity, quiet menace and the odd comical touch.There are other welcome spotlights on characters...like a Jewish girl who we seem running from Landa earl on in the movie.Some scenes have a lot of dialogue and psychological hues to them. They create tension and fear underneath a veneer of civility.I'm not sure that this is the type of movie that will reward repeated views in quick succession, but it's a good movie first time around and will be a good candidate for future views years between drinks, so to speak.",9,2,9,10 October 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," An adequate fan fiction story with a megabudget 70%
","Rogue One sits between 'A new hope' and 'Revenge of the Sith' chronologically. If you're new to the entire Star Wars franchise, where should you begin your viewing? From my point of view, either with this film, Rogue One, or Star Wars: A new hope (episode IV). I came into this franchise at the beginning, with 'A new hope' and as a young person I found it exhilarating. Having seen that movie multiple times since (nearing double figures without the ridiculous number of viewings that the hardcore fans are capable of...going into the dozens), I'm confident that 'A new hope' would stack up well for modern viewers.Apart from Episode III of the prequels, that trilogy was very underwhelming. Rogue One isn't as exhilarating as I remember 'A new hope' being, but as an adult, I did find a couple of humorous moments in it which made me laugh...from memory the comedy in 'A new hope' was pitched to a younger audience. That being said, I suggest starting with the original trilogy (episodes IV-VI) and if you're still keen, see Rogue One next.What's the story in Rogue One? It comes across as a bit of fan fiction, as in it writes a backstory to things that have happened later chronologically in the world of this franchise, but earlier in the release history of the franchise itself. It could also be accused, perhaps, of justifying one element of 'A new hope' which was always subject to some mockery by those who thought a bit too much about the logic of the story. This might be the first Star Wars movie to not open with that iconic scrolling text introducing the story we are about to see, accompanied by John Williams famous score.Anyway, in Rogue One, an Imperial troop carrier lands on a planet. When we initially see that, it looked to me like it was one of those remote control toy spaceships...it just didn't look believable. Later on, you realise that it's meant to be very large and capable of carrying a troop of soldiers. That was really the only time in the film that the special effects were unconvincing. In Star Wars, the Empire (the Imperial side) is the dominant force in that galaxy and they believe themselves to be upholding order but they're obviously the 'bad guys' as they are ruthless in fighting for total control of the galaxy.The Imperial forces are looking for someone on that planet. In the movie we learn from the Rebels (the Alliance which is opposed to the Empire...regarded as 'terrorists' by the Empire, no doubt) that the Empire has a weapon being built which is dubbed the 'planet killer'. The person on that planet which is being sought by the Empire is someone who can help them build that ultimate weapon.Early on there's quite a bit of jumping around from one location in the galaxy to another as well as jumping from one time in the chronology to another. This made following what was going on difficult, although eventually one of those chronological jumps did me the favour of letting me know that the girl who I saw earlier on the planet was now the adult woman I was seeing on the screen. Perhaps that could have been made clearer earlier on. Also not clear...I was wondering the family on that planet were somehow related to the most recent Star Wars movie, 'The Force awakens'. Still not sure about that, but unlikely, in any case.The rest of Rogue One concerns the attempts of the Rebel Alliance to thwart the Empire's plan to use their weapon with planet destroying capabilities. There's a lot of action, the vistas are impressive, with a painterly look to them and occasionally the 3D images look alright. The film is nowhere near as impressive on the 3D front as Avatar was, and that earlier film's use of 3D was most impressive in the little things that it did, the subtle things. In other words, I don't think that it's extremely important to see Rogue One in 3D.There are some moments in the film which I suspect will be used in a video game, should a video game be brought out to tie-in with this film. i.e. you will be replaying those scenes from the film in the game and perhaps seeing cutscenes which match the film too.Random observations:* There are a lot of English voices in this film, as in the characters sound like they are from England. There's a French sounding voice too. Although I haven't seen the particular Japanese franchise, one of the characters in Rogue One brought to mind the Japanese character Zatoichi. I had to search online for that character's name...by typing in his attributes...you'll know him when you see him, I suspect.* Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn has a significant role in this movie. I just mention this because recently another Australian actor, Peter Sumner, who was in 'A new hope' died. There was an interesting article about Sumner, following his death, which dealt with his Star Wars history (see Sydney Morning Herald, 23/11/2016, 'Peter Sumner, Australia's link to the original Star Wars, dies at 74', by Garry Maddox).* There are some implausible moments in Rogue One, like when the woman who helps the Rebels brings out a weapon in front of her 'allies' for the first time.* You can finally hear John Williams' famous score...a little while into the closing credits.In summary, this is a decent entry in the Star Wars canon, which doesn't reach great heights but doesn't embarrass the franchise like the first two prequels did. The droid K-2SO was entertaining and reminded me a bit of C3PO...and Marvin, from the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.There are some familiar faces too and you do get to see them...eventually.",7,0,7,16 December 2016
World War Z," It's the end of the world as we know it. Again. 77.5%
","This is a movie about a zombie apocalypse. Hmm...actually I was wondering whether the 'monsters' in this movie were technically zombies...I didn't think so, but later in the movie they are described in a way which fits in with 'conventional' notions of zombies.The opening credits pretty much blames the U.N. for the zombie pandemic...which perhaps makes lead actor Brad Pitt's character of U.N. 'trouble shooter' Gerry Lane an ironic hero (not sure if that irony still remains after a scene in Israel with a key figure there).World War Z (I say it 'Zed' damn it! Perhaps it's meant to rhyme in the American way with '3'?) doesn't go in for long introductory scenes of life before the pandemic. There's a little of that at the start of the movie with Gerry's family (a wife and two girls). Such scenes are meant to ground Gerry but to me his family seem little more than props. Then again, Gerry doesn't seem a completely grounded character...but this is a zombie movie after all...what did you expect?Pretty soon the world has gone to Hell in a handbasket, overrun with 'zombies'. There are many tense scenes with Gerry (and his family) in imminent danger. Although retired from his U.N. duties, Gerry is roped into helping to defeat the zombie threat.Gerry ends up travelling to many countries trying to find the origin of the pandemic. Displaying the new fad of representing zombies, these hordes are not the shuffling slow pokes of a George A. Romero zombie movie...whilst not exactly supernatural seeming as in the movie 'I am legend', they are a force to be reckoned with. I liked how they posed a greater threat as a group even though they were acting individually...as if their collective intelligence was far greater than that of any one individual. In any case, the action is basically all Hollywood...incredible odds, then overcook those to make the hero seem even more heroic. Then there are the Hollywood clichés to add even more tension to an already tense scene. At times such Hollywoodisations just over-egged the pudding for me.Previously I mentioned that Israel is a location for one of Gerry's trips. That section of the movie was interesting. It did make me wonder what was the subtext here? That it turns out that it was a good idea for Israel to build a wall between itself and the outside world? All in all, this was a tense and entertaining movie. The movie's zombies are unlike those of such pioneering efforts such as 'Night of the living dead' and those not into gore and 'Ewww!' will appreciate the different emphasis of this movie.Personally, I'd like to see a 'slow burn' zombie movie...taking the time to establish life before the threat and to slowly build into the end of the world scenario...hopefully drawing sympathetic characters in the process. Equally important would be to have the 'zombies' not be some sort of super human monsters...more in the George A. Romero mould...but then again, not technically either! I.e. a compromise between these two representations of zombies. The mechanics of how people turned into zombies in World War Z didn't really convince me...but I was happy to suspend disbelief.Saw this movie on an extra-widescreen and in 3D. The extra dimension doesn't really warrant the extra money at the box office though...however, I had some loyalty reward points which meant that I could see it in this form for around half the price of a half-price Tuesday regular 2D movie.",8,1,6,25 June 2013
The Impossible," Harrowing and emotional experience
","After the tsunami hits in this true story, you really get a feel for the aftermath...I love the aesthetic of the holiday resort...it just looks really horrible and the cast and extras look suitably ragged. The special effects and effects are just great. In Hollywood movies when you saw a tsunami, it would be towering over a skyscraper, which just looked incredible. Seeing the news footage of the tsunami at the time, it was a different kettle of fish, but no less bleak. 'The impossible' really captures that moment and what happens afterwards.In one of the news stories I read about the even, it was mentioned that tourists on the beach noticed how far the tide was out before the tsunami hit. That strikes me as being invaluable information, turning a 'That's weird!' observation into - hopefully - a realisation that you need to run to the hills, so to speak, to save your life. However, this bit of crucial information is not mentioned in the movie, which I do feel was a pity...it could have been introduced somehow.Anyway, this movie is about one family's (the Bennetts) experiences of the tsunami and the aftermath...not knowing if they would live through the initial surge, worrying about further surges, and wondering if/how many of their immediate family have died in the initial surge.There are many scenes which establish how nice and good this family but the worth of this movie is in how raw emotion moves you. Naomi Watts as Maria, the mother of 3 young boys does just that, and is deserving of her acting award nominations. The moments where she does make you feel her agony deserves recognition...perhaps even winning any such awards. Ewan McGregor as Henry, the father also has one powerful scene. The one bum note in this move for me was where Henry came across as the 'star' of the movie, instead of just being someone in the same boat as everyone else...I mean how the non-central characters got involved in his story. It just rang false to me...because his plight was no more or less important than anyone else's. Tom Holland has the eldest Bennett boy also has some very good scenes where he powerfully conveys emotion. I'm not sure that the performances are of a consistently high quality, but when they hit those heights, Naomi, Ewan and Tom certainly deserve recognition for their acting. They truly moved me.This movie is a good candidate for recognition in the fields of acting and special effects and effects, costume and the like. There are some scenes of injuries suffered in the tsunami which are definitely not for the squeamish though.Have noticed at least one professional reviewer mark the movie down for substituting a white, Anglo family for the Spanish family this movie was based on. That seems really pedantic to me. The credits to demonstrate a very big Spanish role in the making of this movie, so it looks like a conscious decision to maximise the audience for the story in the West, and a photo of the actual family is shown at the end.If I was to quibble, the start of the movie emphasises the 'true story' aspect of this movie whilst it does have some very Hollywood like coincidences which didn't seem plausible. Maybe such coincidences did actually happen to the family, but in the movie it just seemed contrived...but not in a way which devalued the experience.The end credits lists 'tea boys' in the crew...that must be a first, surely? Pity I missed the person who 'always says...'...not sure if that was sourced from the original family or not...they do get mentioned a bit.",8,1,2,29 January 2013
Argo," Argo think about watching this movie...
","Glad I watched this movie...it had gotten some good reviews but I can't say I was excited to watch it. It concerns the true* story of a C.I.A. backed attempt to rescue diplomatic staff in Iran, during the 'Iran hostage crisis' of 1979. The diplomatic staff were not hostages, but their lives were in grave danger if they could not get out of Iran.Ben Affleck plays Tony Mendez, the C.I.A. operative assigned the task of coming up with a less bad scheme to rescue the U.S. embassy's diplomatic staff, who managed to escape the Iranian mob invasion of the U.S. embassy.Having missed most of the introductory narration to the movie, it felt as though the reasons for the Iranians anger towards the U.S.A. was too glib...easily dismissed as slogans/rhetoric by radicals. However, making a point of catching the next session of the movie to see the full introductory prelude to the movie, that impression was rectified. In an objective narratorial voice, the circumstances of the mob's invasion of the U.S. embassy are provided...at least the historical context is. This kind of information occasionally makes it in to Hollywood type movies nowadays...with films like 'Three kings', for example. The historical circumstances are debatable, but at least they're provided. Taking a position on this, one could say that the movie is about what can happen when corporate rights, coupled with the rights to resources come into conflict with human rights...bad things happen.Personally, not being that familiar with the Iran hostage crisis, I'd say that some more historical information would have interested me. For instance, I have seen reported that Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan played politics with the American hostages for his own political gain...i.e. he sought to have the release of the hostages delayed until after the presidential election in order to secure the presidency by making the Democrat president, Jimmy Carter, appear impotent in the face of intimidation. As president, Reagan also gave weapons to these 'terrorists' in exchange for the hostages (the 'arms-for-hostages' story). None on this historically interesting stuff is mentioned in the movie, so it's more of a Hollywood style movie, in that sense.Ben Affleck gives a highly unusual performance as the mastermind of the rescue. One cricket writer once said of the English captain David Gower that he 'was so relaxed as to be comatose'. I don't mean that as a criticism of Affleck. He does, however, make 'understated' look like the height of 'camp melodrama' by comparison. It's such an unusual performance that I would think it appropriate for him to be in the short list for Best Actor awards. Wouldn't think he would win it. His character seems to have anti-freeze running through his veins! Also oddly, in one scene Affleck looks quite buff...he had a Chuck Norris look about him before that, but that just solidified the impression...you almost expect him to whip out the nunchucks at some point!The power of the mob is effectively conveyed in the opening scenes. Even though this is a good movie, it seems to me that as a viewer I merely understood the drama in the movie rather than felt it as viscerally as I did the mob scenes. The end part of the movie is more effective at creating real drama for the viewer...although sometimes it feels cliché and put-on, as in the scene with the embassy staff in a motor vehicle heading for freedom. In that scene I just thought 'You have got to be kidding me!'.There does seem to be an element of ticking off dot points in the drama too. Some of these work well though, as in how someone who knows the embassy staff's whereabouts will respond to those Iranians who might seek to harm them. That was nicely handled.Even though this is a serious drama, it does have quite a bit of humour in it too. Perhaps the humour can be too self-conscious at times too, e.g. referencing possible roles Ben Affleck may have been discussed for. Anyway, such in-jokes didn't really detract from the movie for me.I did see 'Breaking bad' star Bryan Cranston in the movie, but didn't immediately recognise him, as he seemed much older in this movie. Some of the embassy staff also reminded me of Tobias Fünke (Arrested development), Bargearse (Bluey, via The Late Show) and a 1970s porn star (well, what I'd imagine a 1970s porn star would look like!).* Well, some Canadians have made a point of saying that the movie is more a work of fiction and that Canadians are the real stars of the real events the movie was based on.",8,0,0,19 December 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Saturday matinée action movie 75+
","A visceral follow up to the reboot of a few years back (it actually does seem too long a break for a franchise like this), this is an action packed movie well suited to gourmet popcorn. There is a plot...but only having walked out of the theatre just over two hours ago, I'm stuffed if I can coherently describe what the drama is all about. In other words, I suspect that Mr. Spock would have a field day with the logic of this movie. In any case, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise must travel to enemy territory in order to capture a human villain responsible for the destruction of a Starfleet building in London. Things do not go to plan, as the saying goes. No doubt the seeds of subsequent sequels are sown in this movie.As far as Star Trek movies go, this one is entertaining but I'm not sure how much repeat viewing it has due to its confusing narrative...or at least I don't think it would be repeated viewing in a small space of time. Of the original cast Star Trek movies, I most enjoyed the one about saving whales (whatever that one was called). I'm guessing this movie will also serve as the grounds for a reboot of a critically acclaimed original cast Star Trek movie. However, that one seemed to presuppose knowledge of the original cast TV series (which was before my time and I've yet to see)...and that won't be the case for the reboot...which is good.Any criticisms of this movie I have are minor...it's boy's own adventure material...absurd action scenes where you really could imagine Mr. Spock saying 'That's not safe!'...if he wasn't doing such derring do himself...which he does! For the reboot, I do remember Leonard Nimoy making an appearance in that...as he does in this sequel...which makes me wonder about the mechanics of his character's appearances and interaction with the rebooted crew. The villain of this movie also seems fancifully overpowered. And I worked out how an unfortunate outcome could be reversed before you got the visual clue. Lastly, Chris Pine's Captain Kirk seems a bit too young for mind, given his brashness and swagger. Be interesting to see if the sequel to this movie will be so long in coming out. The events of this movie make me wonder if consequences will follow for actions taken in this movie by the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise.",8,4,7,28 May 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A great movie which will appeal to adults too
","I intended to watch this when it was on the big screen but somehow never got around to it. Watched it on commercial TV the other night. Despite that huge handicap (incessant ads, banner ads etc.), I was totally enchanted by this movie, hence the 10/10 rating. Based on a series of books which I haven't read, I must say that as a movie, it worked wonderfully. In fact, it's even better than any of the Harry Potter movies I've seen (another book to cinema series of tales).Set during World War II in England, at the time of the German air-raids, it's the tale of the Pevensie family. The children are sent to the countryside to avoid the worst of the blitz. The children comprise the elder role-models Peter and Susan, along with their younger brother and sister Edmund and Lucy. I must say that Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie is absolutely adorable. Don't let that description put you off...these are English characters, not those highly annoying 'cute' kids American popular culture likes to foist on us.In this movie's favour is the humour...I was often amused by exchanges between the characters-like when Lucy first meets Mr. Tumnus.Anyway, from the grim opening of this movie, it eventually explores the fantastic alternative universe that is Narnia...a land of mythical creatures, both good and evil. On that level, this movie is a great adventure with great spectacle and terrific CGI effects (computer generated special effects-of places and creatures).Not exactly sure what age group this movie is pitched at, but I think it is a PG movie...perhaps a bit to dark for very young children-it does get into 'heavy' topics at times, which very young children might get upset by.Another big plus for this movie is the complex depictions of the characters. The eldest children are sensible. Lucy is good and Edmund has a more interesting trajectory to follow. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is brilliant-one of those 'complex' characters I mentioned earlier. She also happens to be more menacing than Darth Maul!One very small gripe-a little annoyed at one of the mythical characters that made an appearance in this moviesomething for Virginia, perhaps?Anyway, this was such a promising opening movie that I will definitely see the first sequel next week, at the cinema. Sometimes you watch a movie that you know will or may become a franchise. More often than not, you make up your mind to not watch anymore in the series. The sequel will have to be really bad to kill this franchise.P.S. I've seen the sequel to this movie and will post up my review now.",10,1,1,20 June 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not as good as the TV series
","This movie is like 'The sound of music', but not as funny. By that I mean it has the American passion for musical numbers (a passion that I don't share). If the songs were better, I'd give this movie more. It has nothing of the poppy catchiness of 'Dreidl' from the vastly superior TV version of this cartoon.Another thing which I think is noteworthy is that this movie made me react like Australian politician Franca Arena: 'The children! The children!'. In other words, I kept thinking how inappropriate this movie is for children. One moment of shock and delight happened when the boys in the cartoon sang a song with lyrics 'uncle f_r'. The lyric is not bowdlerised in the cartoon.The other shocking moment in the cartoon (at least when thinking of 'impressionalbe minds') is a scene where you see what looks like a photo of an erect penis (if it's not real, it looks very real).Anyway, I think this foray into movies is a very disappointing one for the boys from South Park: the foul mouthed passive aggressive/aggressive aggressive Cartman, the conscience of the trio, Kyle, the po' white trash of Kenny, and Stan...whatever attribute it is that he's meant to possess.Some regular characters of the TV series make an appearance in this movie: Saddam Hussein and Satan, as well as, from memory, Terrence and Phillip.Overall, the movie lacks the killer social and pop cultural satire of the TV series. And it has loads more music. Americans and music...what's up with that? I mean, I HATED those scenes in movies where characters burst into song, like 'Beetlejuice' and 'The wedding planner' (or whatever that movie was where they sing 'I say a little prayer'...UGGH!!).",4,0,4,3 July 2008
Ted," Disney meets Family Guy meets porno meets spooky...75%
","This comedy starts off like a Disney movie or something...a lonely boy wants a BFF and his teddy bear ('Ted') fills the breach. It's not as stupid as it sounds, as the boy - John Bennett (played by Bretton Manley) - makes a wish...on Christmas...with a falling star in the vicinity. Writer/director/voice of Ted Seth McFarlane obviously knows his stuff, as this plausible scenario is better than just about anything...save John's teddy bear being hit by lightning or something. In any case, Ted is now alive and John's BFF. We then catch up on John many years later, as a 35 year old (played by Marky Mark Wahlberg) with a beautiful girlfriend - Lori Collins (played by Family Guy regular Mila Kunis) - and Ted...as a bad influence on him.'Ted' works as a comedy film with a narrative arc which sustains it. That arc concerns whether John will live happily ever after with Lori, or whether Ted drives them apart.For some reason, Mark Wahlberg has a strong Boston accent...I'm not sure if that is acting or...everyone he plays has a Boston accent...because he does...or something. In any case, Mark and Mila have a nice chemistry in this movie and the presence of Ted in their world feels believable...I particularly like Ted's gait...as soon as I saw it, I though 'Yeah, that looks right'. Joel McHale as Rex - Lori's boss - does a nice turn as the office sleaze. As a movie, it's funnier than Seth McFarlane's lesser cartoon 'American dad' and about as funny as an average episode of 'Family guy' (so, there were many laugh out loud moments in this movie). Despite the Disney-esque aspects to this movie, it's really not suitable for children...really, really, really not suitable for children. There are simulated sex scenes between Ted and a checkout chick, bong smoking and some creepy people who become part of the story later on. In other words, it's the kind of territory explored in Family Guy...if you're familiar with that, you'll know the kind of humour to expect in this. Fortunately there's nothing that really drags in this movie, as there was in Family Guy...that whole over-flogged 'Stewie as an evil genius' plot arc...which I was glad to be rid of!",7,3,6,17 July 2012
Terminator Salvation," The future isn't what it used to be...
","It's been a few weeks since I've seen this film, but I remember it being a good 'popcorn' type of movie. In some ways the world it creates is in line with what the re-imagined Star Trek movie did (also released in 2009). So, if you hate what has been done in this movie, it's possible to rationalise and to hope for a better attempt at a sequel-reimagination. If you love this movie, then the world which this movie creates will be your preferred Terminator world.For me, this is by no means a great movie. It's entertaining but that's about it. Not sure that it has any repeat viewing value. Like I said, the world which this movie creates doesn't seem to gel with what we came to expect based on the earlier movies. Not into the mythology of this series enough to know whether paradoxes or contradictions are created.By far the most interesting character in this movie is Marcus Wright, played by Sam Worthington. He's a mystery character whom John Connor (played by Christian Bale) does not know whether to trust or not...is Wright a man or a machine? Friend or foe?For the second time in the last few years, Bale has been upstaged by an Australian co-star...the last time was with Heath Ledger's immortal characterisation of The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' Batman movie. It looks to me as if Bale is going down the route of trying to make a lot of money in movies...he's betting that there will be a Terminator series of sequels starring him, and that he'll make a fortune from them. Unfortunately, like Batman, John Connor is rather dull and a blank canvas. The parts which actors would jump at, like The Joker and Marcus Wright, are infinitely more interesting than the box office heroes Bale is playing...perhaps this truth galls Bale so much that he would be inclined to verbally abuse crew members making Terminator: Salvation?Anyway, lots of action in this movie, which is well done, and I did find the twists that this movie brought up to be interesting. Maybe other fans of this series will find those twists to be more of a problem for them than I did. Can't say that I am locking in viewing any subsequent movies in this series. The Transformers sequel has killed my desire to see any more movies in that franchise. Whilst having more action than this movie, Transformers is a whole lot less interesting and entertaining...but you would never guess that going on its extraordinary box office success.",7,3,6,23 July 2009
Juno," Engaging tale of a pregnant teenager and the choices she faces
","Engaging tale of a pregnant teenager and a married couple looking to adopt a child from her. This movie has a very 'indie cinema' vibe to it. I really liked the quirky, sort of folk music this movie utilises, though I could understand some people finding this a turn off.Juno is very much a 'star vehicle' for the charming Ellen Page. Page pretty much gets all the good lines to herself. This movie will stand or fall depending on whether you are open to the character of Juno.To my mind, Juno shares DNA (metaphorically speaking) with characters such as Darlene from 'Roseanne', which was a classic U.S. sit-com. Juno isn't as bleak as Darlene though. Another reference point for this film would be the delightful if short-lived U.S. comedy/drama series 'Freaks and geeks'. In fact, I was tempted to describe the character of 'Juno' as a 'freak' but thought better of it...until she uses the term to describe herself. For those of you not familiar with the caste system in the US, people fall into castes such as 'jock' (a sport oriented person), 'nerd' (an academically orientated person), 'dork' (socially awkward) and, amongst others, 'freak', meaning a person who doesn't really fit the 'desirable' caste category of 'jock' or 'cheerleader' (guys want to be jocks and girls want to be cheerleaders in the U.S. apparently).As an Australian, I tend to view 'freak' as meaning 'normal'-people like Juno are infinitely more interesting to know and seem like people you would like to hang out with, as opposed to the more desirous castes, who seem really obnoxious.A pleasure of this film is the interaction between Juno and prospective adoptive father Mark, played by Jason Bateman. Their conversations on the merits of movies/music is a highlight. Be warned, you do see a scene from a graphic horror movie for a few seconds.Juno is impossibly witty and sensible-as if rewritten by a mature adult. I'd give this film 7/10 but suspect it will have repeat viewing value, hence the 8/10. In fact, as my reviews for this that years Oscar contenders shows, this movie would have been a worthy 'dark-horse' to take out the 'Best Movie' Oscar. Not to be though.Anyway, must say how cool Juno looked in that scene where she is sitting on a couch, with a smoking pipe in her mouth, Sherlock Holmes style. Impossibly cool!",8,8,16,4 July 2008
Deadpool 2," Deadpool, dramedy, dismemberment 65+%
","The sequel to Deadpool begins with a bang...or should I say 'boom'? It then works backwards to how things arrived at this point, which is rather apt, given how the story will mirror this narrative device later on in the film. Deadpool 2 also revels in the whimper too...it must have the daggiest soundtrack ever used, anywhere...which isn't a bad thing. Right at the start, you hear Air Supply's classic soft rock love song 'All out of love'...which I like. Really like. And I'm not just saying that because I'm an Australian. Didn't mind 'Escape (The piÃ±a colada Song)' either...but not so much. It takes something like 15 minutes, I think, for the opening credits to start playing, and I regret not paying attention to this right away, because the film refuses to take this part seriously. If you've ever seen a James Bond film, you'll appreciate the pop-cultural references that Deadpool 2 provides. The plot of the movie concerns Deadpool being at a low ebb and taking it upon himself to help a troubled teenage mutant (think X-Men material) who flirting with the dark side, is he. That teenager's accent caught my attention...I wondered if he was Australian...or a New Zealander...fortunately Deadpool cleared that up for me...eventually. Even though I hadn't seen Deadpool since the cinema release and I had only seen it once, I didn't really feel out of the loop like I did with the latest Avengers' movie, 'Avengers: Infinity war'. Speaking of 'Avengers: Infnity war', since it's not around at the moment, I'll just say that it was good that Deadpool 2 had humour which actually worked. Its batting average for jokes was good, if not quite Bradmanesque. Cf. 'Avengers: Infinity war', which seems to be have been written by Marvel's C Team's 2nd XI's bench players. The humour is quite postmodern, as in it erases the boundary between the real world and the fictional world of the film...I believe that phrase 'breaking the fourth wall' is another way of saying this. One character (metaphorically speaking...since I didn't know nearly all of them) left me feeling a little out of the loop...the bloke from the future...made me wonder if I had missed some film where he appears. He's kinda, sorta introduced to the audience after he's been carrying on for a while. The Marvel Comic Universe (MCU) does seem to rely on having a fan base which requires no introduction to its characters...so none is given. Another disorientating feature of the film was the use of dream-like sequences. There's more than one. And it made me wonder if more of the film was actually a dream-like state than I had thought...which I don't think it was...but it would be have been good if this wasn't as confusing in the film as it turned out to be. As for the ending...it does make me wonder if there will be consequences for other MCU franchises, even though I haven't gotten the impression that the Deadpool franchise really sets the agenda for that, as the other MCU franchises do. Also, the ending would seem to require a sequel which directly follows on from the events of this film, although that didn't create any issues for me, as far as feeling tricked into being forced to watch the next one (I got enough out of Deadpool 2 to keep sticking with the franchise, whereas after having seen 'Avengers: Infinity war', I'm inclined to bail on that franchise...perhaps). Deadpool was tracking as a 65% kind of movie to me, meaning with my harsh rounding practice I would have given it 6 stars out of 10. However, given that I liked the ending, I've decided to add a '+' to the 65%, in order for the film to graduate to a score of 7 stars out of 10.N.B. It should be noted that this film is very violent at times, with accompanying gore...not for the squeamish at these moments.Random observations:* Check out what Deadpool writes on a cereal box in one scene* Near the end of the movie, it seems a plot hole to me that Deadpool knew what the guy from the future had done...well, not so much a plot hole, as an obvious difficulty in making such story elements coherent... 'paradox' would be a good word for it, I think* Lead...I don't think that lead has the properties attributed to it in this film by Deadpool...as with my previous point, I think it's just basically another example of Hollywood type narrative devices which don't really stand up to too much scrutiny...suspend disbelief, in other words* Also near the end of the movie, when Deadpool is supine, an expression does appear on his face, momentarily, which is uncannily reminiscent of how the Michael Scott character in the US version of 'The office' would mug. Doubt that that was intentional, just noticeable (to me).* What's a Jimmy Chunga? Not sure that I spelt that right, either...tried looking it up in the first week of July...didn't find it in the script, but I see my mistake, the word I'm after is 'chimichanga'...and I still have no idea what it means in the context...a meaningless catchphrase invented for the film?* Note too self: look up 'Juggernaut' on Wikipedia. I think that Deadpool says that that is his favourite Marvel character...or something...which I can't quite remember. Also look up 'Captain Marvel'...I came across this character when exploring something related to 'Avengers: Infinity war'.",7,0,0,8 June 2018
Spider-Man 3," Okay at best, embarrassing and cringe-worthy at worst
","Even though I don't particularly remember the previous movies, I'd have to say that this movie is the worst of the lot. I'd say that the original was the best.In this movie, new dynamics are added when goo from outer space lands on Earth, and affects Spider-man, amongst others, giving them variations to their power, which complicates their relations to others.A new villain with super powers is also created due to an accident.Of course, the special effects are excellent and one of the newly created super-villains is particularly spectacular.However, what makes the movie so disappointing is the fact that it seems written by small boys, for small boys. The most cringe-worthy parts are when Spider-man is affected by the space-goo, and his alter-ego too, Peter Parker. The scene where Peter Parker does a variation of Tony Manero (from Saturday Night Fever) is cringe-worthy. Other parts of the movie, where loose ends are tied up are also boy-like in execution.I know I may be too old for this kind of stuff...I just wish that the script was more sophisticated as well as the way the plot plays out.Kirsten Dunst, as Parker/Spider-man's girlfriend, has some perhaps ironic new dimensions to her relationship with Parker. I can sympathise with what the makers of the movie were trying to achieve, but I do think they could have done it better.In the same way that the second Matrix movie SHOULD have warned me off bothering to see the third in the series, this movie MAY signal that the makers are flogging a dead horse now.The embarrassing parts of the movie are what I take away from it, mostly. But yeah, the special effects are really good.",5,2,3,11 May 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A slow burn mystery...
","As with the last film I saw at the cinema recently (Hugo), this is another movie which has a leisurely, if not genteel pace. In my brief notes for this film I make a faux pas...I assumed it was based on fact. Not sure why I would think that...I've never seen any version of this story before, but maybe some names from it had seeped into my consciousness, like 'Smiley', perhaps.Even though this is an English spy story, it's unlike the kind which are usually brought to mind by that phrase (such as the James Bond series). There are some moments of shocking violence in this movie or the aftermath of same, but they are spaced at long intervals. If you are patient, the main 'hook' of this movie is guessing who the mole or double agent in the highest reaches of Britain's secret service is. However, I don't think that this is a 'proper' whodunnit movie, as in the viewer being presented with clues which allows one to deduce who the mole is. That's the thrust of this story...after a British operative is killed in an overseas operation, none of the senior spooks of 'The circus' (the name the spies give to their organisation) are immune from suspicion. So, a recently retired spook is brought in to find the traitor.Personally I found this a bit hard to follow...if I'd made my faux pas here, I would have said a documentary form would have been a better way to know what happened, assuming one was interested in the facts of the case. Some of the senior spooks seem like likely candidates for the mole...I'd often find myself looking to one or other spook and hypothesising them to be the mole. In a sense the clues are 'red herrings', but in another sense they are merely misdirections, as the suspect could have legitimate reasons for acting in a way which may cast suspicion on their motives. Anyway, my hypotheses did get a bit silly at times!The movie itself looks like it could have been shot in the late 1960s or into the 1970s. The narrative is told in an elliptical manner...certain events and details being returned to, on occasion. There are some interesting titbits in this movie...be interesting to know if they have a factual basis...e.g. the staff of The Circus singing the Soviet anthem! (I think that that's what it is!) and what we learn of American torture techniques, which sound ghastly. Also liked the line in this movie about choosing sides in the Cold War 'It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one'.One of the failings of this movie, I think, is that it's not always clear what is happening in it...there's one scene where the man investigating The Circus for the mole - George Smiley, I believe, played by Gary Oldman - is upset by seeing a woman fondled by another man. I had no idea who the woman was and perhaps the man touching her either. I can presume who she was and the man too, but really, the audience should have been explicitly shown who these people were so that they would know why Smiley was upset. If details were given, then due to the leisurely pace of the movie, one could assume that we would have forgotten this information...hence a reminder being given to us would have been useful.Some irrelevant observations: Toby Jones - played by Percy Alleline - reminded me of the actor Dick van Patten! Peter Guillam - played by Benedict Cumberbatch - reminded me of the actor Glenn Robbins...in Kel mode...or the guy who did the daggy dancing in the Fast Forward sketch series, I believe! I think it was Guillam who gave me this impression...didn't make a note on it...and it relates to my point of feeling in the dark about these people...difficult keeping tabs on all of them...who they are...what they do etc.Was amused by the use of the song 'The second best secret agent in the whole wide world'...might be interesting to look these lyrics up!Anyway, I was glad I didn't make the faux pas of including in my notes the observation that it was 'odd' that the film had the usual disclaimer at the end credits about it being a work of fiction...PHEW!",7,1,2,8 February 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," A wonderful fairytale for adults...
","Set in Spain, during World War II (I saw the version with English subtitles), this story concerns the family of a Spanish officer, Captain Vidal (Sergi López). Captain Vidal has had his wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) move to a region of Spain where he has to combat rebels. Carmen also brings her daughter, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), from a previous relationship. At their new home, domestic and military duties play out.Even though this movie is a fantastic fairytale, I don't think it is suitable for pre-teens, as it does have some gory violence.The English translation of the film's title is more specific than the Spanish title I think. 'Pan' is the name of a human/animal hybrid type god in Greek mythology (a satyr, I think...or analogous to that). The Spanish title for this film, I believe, merely refers to the kind creature that Pan is, not a specific creature.Anyway, little girl Ofelia encounters a satyr/faun near her new home. That (unnamed) satyr gives her three tasks to accomplish some objective which is not told to her. To someone unfamiliar with the specifics of the myths represented, I have to say I was unsure whether the creature was good or evil. There are some fantastic looking scenes for these elements of the story in any case.The melding of the everyday and fairytale imagery works wonderfully well in this movie. You could say that you can interpret the movie as working on two levels...a world where myth and reality co-exist, or a world where we experience the mental life of the child, Ofelia.To that extent, the ending is ambiguous...it works well however one interprets the status of this myth/reality we have experienced. If it was all Ofelia's inner mental life, then one can view it as something of a consolation for her.Highly recommended. You may also enjoy the movie 'Let the right one in'. Another story for adults. An American remake is being filmed...see the original, please!",10,2,8,10 January 2010
Knocked Up," When Slacker met Yuppie
","Being facetious, one could say that the premise of the movie is pure science fiction fantasy: a somewhat overweight dope-smoking slacker somehow meets an absolutely beautiful woman who has been promoted to an on-air role on an entertainment TV programme.The beautiful woman in question is Katherine Heigl, who plays Alison Scott. She has a terrific dead-pan persona when dealing with the slacker's ways & attitudes (the slacker is Ben Stone, played by Seth Rogen)...a real poker-face. I'm not sure if Heigl's teeth have been done by Industrial Light & Magic, but they are hard to look at without sunglasses.Anyway, as a result of Scott & Stone's union, Scott gets pregnant. This serves as the premise for which this odd couple spend more time with each other than one would ordinarily expect.Much of the humour arises from Stone's slacker ways (along with his friends too...each of which is horrifyingly interesting...like a car-crash). The way Scott doesn't give anything away in dealing with Stone is also funny.The good thing about this movie is the way that the comedic load is shared amongst the cast...from the main players to people with minor roles. E.g. the scenes with Scott's superiors are very funny...especially her female superior, who is a bit of a seething mass of resentment towards Alison.Or the married couple Scott and Stone hang out with (the wife is Scott's sister). Both married characters get to steal a few scenes with their face pulling or outrageous opinions.I especially like the scene where Alison's sister just has a melt-down when a black bouncer refuses to let her and Alison into a night club. What is even better is when the black bouncer gets to say some good lines in response.For me, the movie tends to fall a bit towards the end.i.e.when Ben and the husband take magic mushrooms before seeing Cirque de Soleil. It isn't quite as funny as it sounds.Things pick up for the funny birth scene.",6,0,1,20 March 2008
Blades of Glory," Absurdly funny movie
","This is the funniest movie I've seen at the cinema this year-it's funny in an absurd way. The premise of the movie is simple yet absurd...two brilliant male ice-skaters tie for a competition gold medal and end up fighting as a result. They are both banned from the sport for life. Due to a loop-hole they can skate competitively again...in pairs skating. You can guess what transpires here.The feuding skaters feud, no doubt, due to their completely different personalities. Chaz, played by Will Ferrell, is a macho, testosterone fuelled sex-addict with a butch skating style. Jimmy, played by 'Napolean Dynamite's' lead, Jon Heder, is an effeminate and graceful skater. Much of the humour involves them having stupid school-boy like exchanges.Another big factor in the comedy is how 'unseemly' it is for two male skaters to skate as a pair. Chaz can't seem to hide his disgust at some of the positions he and Jimmy have to get into for their art.One thing that I got great enjoyment from was the choice of music-some beautiful music ('Time to say goodbye') to introduce Jimmy, and the macho rock of 'Stroke me' for Chaz. And Queen's classic 'Flash' gets used to great effect too.Early on, there is some commentary of the two guys skating which would be very familiar in style and substance to that provided here in Australia by Roy and H.G. in their brilliant Sydney Olympics 'parallel' commentary for their short series 'The Dream' (should be on DVD, I think). Blades Of Glory is like what a sport would look like IF what Roy and H.G. described was actually accurate. For Roy and H.G. fans, you will see in the movie plenty of 'battered sav' and 'I'm a princess' skating moves.The film does feature some adult content, so is probably a bit too risqué for pre-teens. One of the highlights of the movie is a 'legendary' skating move called 'The iron lotus'. It is a truly stunning set piece & good for some Holy Grail type laughs.A competing pair also provides some laughs from left field-their last skating routine in the movie is right out of the Roy and H.G. handbook of interpretive dance!",8,0,3,24 July 2007
Suicide Squad," This reminds me why I usually avoid most superhero films...42.5%
","Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this film is the title...which was maybe just enough of a lure to get me into the cinema to watch it. After the closing credits had finished, I remembered why I tend to like the anti-superhero films the best...they're just more entertaining. Amongst those films that I really enjoyed are 'Watchmen', 'Kick-Ass' and 'Hancock', with the latter starring Will Smith, who also has a featured role in 'Suicide squad'.The plot concerns a secret U.S. government agency setting about to assemble a black ops type team of supervillains, in the wake of the events in some previous superhero film...which I couldn't be bothered watching...one with Superman...or something...the reasoning being that the world needs powerful fighters to combat threats like another Superman...but one committed to evil, not niceness. All the supervillains that the agency has in mind to recruit are in a high security gaol. Obviously a method to gain the supervillains' co-operation needs to be found...it's not like public service is very important to them. The agency's potential employee screening tests will be critically important...A subplot involves a 'romance' between two supervillians...Harley Quinn (played by Australian actress Margot Robbie) and The Joker (played by Jared Leto). Their romance is made more problematic by The Joker not actually being in gaol.Whilst the film does at least provide some sort of backstory or origin story for each supervillain, I just didn't find any of it (i.e. the characters or the film) engaging. My guess is that the people who will get the most out of this film will be those who have immersed themselves in this universe, via comics or other media. As someone who had not done so, I just didn't get a thrill out of seeing all these characters, most of whom I was not familiar with.Some characters I was familiar with, like The Joker. Jared Leto's portrayal provides hints of Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz in 'Apocalypse now', Jaws, from the Bond universe and a sort of a punk gangster...part Johnny Rotten, part the white singer from The Prodigy. Does The Joker command the screen? No. Of the 'conventional' superhero movies I've seen, The Dark Knight stands out for one thing...the performance of Australian actor Heath Ledger as The Joker. By the end of that Batman trilogy I realised one thing...Batman himself is boring. Whilst being a good movie, The Dark Knight could have been great...if it was 152 minutes of Heath Ledger playing The Joker in it.Anyway, since the early part of the movie concerns the recruitment of these supervillains, I was left wondering who on Earth they would be fighting...they do get to go up against a powerful character though, which is just as well (for the viewer).Throughout the entire movie, I laughed only once due to a character saying something funny. Can't remember who said the thing which made me laugh...The Joker? Harley Quinn? These are meant to be 'wacky' and 'zany' characters, right? Harley seems more like a rebellious teenager than a psychopath (but she is cute). The Joker is mirthless. Supervillains? They seem more like misunderstood and redeemable characters. And Captain Kangaroo (played by Australian Jai Courtney) is a supervillain? He seems more like a grown up The Feral Kid or a glorified goon. Not having explored these characters elsewhere, it just surprised me that the agency in this film would want to recruit somebody like Captain Kangaroo.What's the worst thing about this film? The soundtrack. It's not that I didn't like some of the songs used (early on you hear a lot of baby boomer era pop and rock songs), it's more that these songs function as a substitute for the film's inability to create characters or moments which capture your imagination. In other words, the music is supposed to create that thrill of excitement which the film is incapable of delivering. It's just lazy a lazy, ineffectual shortcut to affect. If you were born after the 1960s and 1970s and are unfamiliar with these songs, then it's hard to imagine these songs being able to manipulate your emotions and thus make up for what the film is failing to deliver. There are some songs from later though. You only hear a few seconds of these songs...not doubt used so as to be included on the soundtrack. Can't say that I heard enough songs that I particularly liked to want to own such an album though.Would I want to see this film again? No. It has zero repeat viewing value. Neither the characters nor the film captures the imagination. By the by: Rick Flag (played by Joel Kinnaman)? Weird name. Made me think of 'Ric Flair'! Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is...surprising. Hmm. She's with the government? M'kay.Will I watch a sequel? I very much doubt it.",4,1,2,25 August 2016
Taxi Driver," In retrospect, quite funny, in an odd way
","When I saw this movie again a few years ago, what struck me the most-compared to when I watched it on VHS as a teenager for the first time-was the humour of this movie. Hmmm, maybe the humour is unintentional...I dunno. Funny in any case.Here's a brief and (very) vague synopsis of the plot: a veteran of the Vietnam war (Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle) returns to the U.S.A. and works as a taxi driver. He forms relationships as a result of his work with two people on opposite ends of the social spectrum: a young, beautiful, middle-class woman (Cybill Shepherd as Betsy) who is helping a politician run for office, and an underaged sex worker (Jodie Foster as Iris Steensma). Perhaps the movie is part social commentary on the time of the Vietnam War...I dunno. In any case, Bickle seems to damaged by his experience in The Nam and by the world he comes back to. Towards the end of the movie, there is some gory violence, so, if you don't like the sight of blood, this might be one to avoid.Now, for the real reason I posted up this review...to share the parts of the movie that made an impression on me: firstly, as a young teen, I can't really believe how I did not form a giant exclamation mark over my head when Bickle takes Betsy to a hardcore porn movie on their first date. Man, that is just SO funny, on reflection! So yeah...that's another thing I should mention-you do see some shots of what the 'love birds' are watching...and I can't remember how explicit it is-there is naked flesh though.Lastly, another funny thing about this movie-who'd a thunk that taxi drivers discuss philosophy amongst themselves? And Bertrand Russell to boot! That's another thing that didn't trigger an epileptic laughing fit the first time I saw it. Hmmm...maybe if Bickle worked at McDonald's the scene would have been more believable?Parting shot-De Niro is very good in this movie. Can't say the same for 'Mean Streets'-well, I mean that the movie is not that good, not Bob. He does have a great scene in Mean Streets where he reveals his true nature. Kind of like a similarly great scene in the Australian movie 'He died with his felafel in his hands', where the main character's emotions bubble over the surface.",8,0,2,4 July 2008
Life of Pi," A compelling story. 85+%
","I can't say that I was very excited to see this movie but I thought I'd give it a shot and found it very rewarding. In fact, it has repeat viewing value, given the ending. What surprised me most, perhaps, was the wit and humour in the dialogue. Not having read the book on which it was based, I have nothing else to compare it to, and found the story worked well as a spectacle...of which there are many.Without giving too much away, the story concerns the life and adventures of Pi Patel. We see him as a small boy and as an adult recounting the adventure most of us would be familiar with via the commercials for this film...himself as a teenager (played well by Suraj Sharma) adrift at sea, with a wild tiger as both a constant threat to him yet a constant but uneasy companion. Most of the movie is set at sea and here the cinematography (which I saw in 3D) is absolutely magnificent. You really do feel a sense of the infinite as Pi drifts endlessly on an endless ocean. Even some of the urban settings in Pi's childhood do have a wonderful picture postcard quality to them.Another contender for most surprising aspect to this movie was the theme of religion. I just did not expect this to be part of this movie, for whatever reason. In a way the movie is about religion. Or stories. A story about stories, in other words. Some professional reviews do mention the issue of how to interpret the movie. Maybe it is a parable? Could it be like a dream, requiring Freud to make sense of it? In these interpretative strategies there is the problem of mapping one thing from the sea adventure to some other thing from Pi's ordinary life. And doing that to account for everything. The desire to do so is powerful but the adult Pi does comment near the end of the movie about the merits of this procedure.Some professional reviews I've seen criticise the narrative device of having an adult Pi interviewed by a writer. Since I don't know whether this was in the book or not, I can say that it wasn't so much of an issue for me. There was a concern before I saw this movie that it might come across like one of Kamahl's commercials for a certain brand of tea, but it worked well for me. The writer (played by Rafe Spall) functions as an 'everyman' asking the kind of questions the curious audience might want to ask. Being a literal minded person, I did really appreciate the writer's attempt to interpret Pi's sea adventure...it is that titbit of information which gives the movie repeat viewing value...I had expected to give this movie 80%, but it's this potential repeat viewing value which bumps my score up to 85+%.Special mention should be given to the special effects in this movie. It's great. Having this volatile mix of carnivores and herbivores on Pi's boat interact with each other in a believable way was admirably achieved. At times the tiger seemed to be a CGI creation, but maybe I was wrong on that? It's very rare that you think these special effects don't feel quite right.It was a surprise to me to see so many young children watching this movie at the cinema. Appropriately, perhaps, the animal life cycle was sanitised on the boat...there is no great gore to speak of, but there are some dark themes verbalised at the end of the movie, which makes me wonder how suitable it is for children. But that darkness houses felt pain, which was another rewarding aspect to this film. It has great humanity.Whilst a movie like 'Seven psychopaths' is my pick as the most entertaining movie for the year, I don't think I would be allowed to pick that as my choice for best movie. 'Life of Pi' seems a more intellectual choice to make and I do feel that an award for the best movie of the year would be well deserved, along with awards for cinematography. Ang Lee deserves a nomination for direction too. Suraj Sharma is also worthy of a nomination. This movie is a wonderful spectacle but the tale has hidden depth to it, which makes it ripe for revisiting and seeing it anew. Which viewing would explain the meaning of the movie best? That is the question. When Pi's father states his preference for the scientific story of life, I do wonder whether the movie agrees with him or not...or if there is truth in any story...just preferences for one story over another. Was the other story Pi told the writer true?",9,4,8,15 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: The rise of Skywalker. The final word: The force is strong with the final hour of this film
","My expectations for this film were quite low and I thought that I would be writing something like: 'A forgettable series with forgettable characters comes to a forgettable end' for the third film in this trilogy. Early on, things weren't tracking well, as far as my score went, as I found the action uninvolving and the comedy not grabbing me, such as when Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) and Poe (played by Oscar Isaac) were bickering early on in the film. To be fair, though, in retrospect the 'banter' between Han Solo and Princess Leia in Episode V, especially, I think, wasn't that great...when viewed again as someone who is no longer a pre-teen. Engaging banter isn't a strength of George Lucas, as it is for, say, Joss Whedon (e.g. the 'Buffy the vampire slayer' TV series).The film steadily becomes more involving, tracking to score about 70% for me. It's not until there is less than an hour to go when it finally becomes a worthy instalment in the Star Wars canon. Why? Because, for the first time in this trilogy, probably in the entire trilogy of trilogies, it made me feel this kind of emotion (Episode IV might have been the only film in the entire series which made me feel the emotion of exhilaration for the action scenes but I was a young child at the time). This is what the all the trilogy sequels to Episodes IV - VI lacked. Where on Earth was this film-making ability in the last two sequels? I should note that this emotion that I felt was not due to any character development on Disney's part, just the situation that the characters found themselves in (analogous to chess pieces, where we don't really identify each piece as a character...but when they get taken off the board, we feel emotion as a result). The final (?) trilogy reminded me of the final film in the 2nd trilogy, Episode III, in that in an otherwise dull trilogy, the final instalment set the bar for the trilogy where it should have been all along...higher than what the previous two films had attained.Anyway, Episode IX involves the final confrontation between the remnants of armies of the Rebel Alliance and the successors of The Empire. That's assuming that Disney doesn't resurrect the franchise, following on from the events of this...Episode X to infinity, no doubt.As I stated earlier, I have found the two trilogies which followed Episodes IV - VI to fall well short of an acceptable quality of storytelling, which was achieved for Episode IV- VI (well, especially Episode IV-V). Unlike Episode IV- VI, I haven't found any of the characters memorable and coming into each new film in the trilogy, years since I saw the previous one in the cinema, I've already forgotten the main characters' names and their backstory. These characters have all the personality of George Lucas' figurine merchandise. Unlike how 'The Empire strikes back' really makes a landmark of Luke Skywalker's training to be a Jedi, in this latest trilogy, Rey's journey is just a blur and when she appears in this film as a powerful Jedi, you just wish that the trilogy had paced her journey more slowly and deliberately, which I think I stated in my review here for the first film in this latest trilogy.There is fan service in this film, so some of the people who have watched the entire series in the main franchise may be delighted, no doubt, by the many instances of them, either through characters or places. Some of the fan service I liked and some I was indifferent to. Editing this review again over a week after seeing the film, I can't remember if I disliked instances of this fan service. Some of the imagery is stunning. When a planet with an ocean is visited, the scale of the waves is very impressive.Even though my knowledge of the series is not encyclopedic (I've seen Episode IV a handful of times or more and only its two sequels more than once), it does seem to me that there are a lot of logical holes in Episode IX or logical leaps, when not so bad. For instance, it didn't make sense to me why the person who targeted Rey's parents would want to do so. I think that Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) gives what is meant to me an explanation for it but I didn't quite catch all that he said. Just knowing the pieces in play for this event meant that I didn't find it believable. Sometimes what appears to be a logical flaw is shown to not be so by subsequent revelations. Still, when you think that people wouldn't do something in that situation or wouldn't know something that they do in the film, you have to query how alert the writers were to this. A variation of this criticism of mine is how people do something stupid, e.g. Finn (played by John Boyega) choosing a particularly inopportune time to want to chat to Rey on that planet with the ocean.For me, the great 'What if...? is 'How would George Lucas have written the final instalments in his trilogy?'. Now, this question doesn't weigh on me so much since he did such a bad job on Episode 1 - II (as well as showing an unfortunate decline in his powers in Episode VI), but what would he have done for Episode VII - IX had he been in the same league as he was for Episode IV - V especially? Really, I have no doubt that Luke Skywalker would have been central to it.That brings me back to Disney taking on this franchise, after Lucas, perhaps, lost his nerve in the wake of the reaction to Episode I - III. Many times in this final trilogy, especially for this final film, brought to mind analogies between George Lucas and Disney. Disney has been like a cuckoo, laying its egg in the world of Lucas' nest. Things get Oedipal too, in my mind. For instance (if you haven't seen any of the films in this franchise, then this sentence contains a spoiler), how Disney killed off Luke Skywalker, the hero of the Episode IV - VI. I just can't believe that Lucas would have gone down this path...the dark side, if you will! (The same thought applies to the fates of other important characters from the franchise in this final trilogy. How Lucas would have dealt with the Carrie Fisher situation is a live question, too, for me. I like much what of what Disney has done on that front in this film.) An emblematic example of this interpretation of mine is the final sentence that you hear in this film. It's Disney calling itself 'Lucas', in other words, when that is what is in doubt!That being said, this film eventually ends up being a fine film.Notes to self:* The ending...when the villain of the piece seems to change what they said were their plans due to the actions of their adversary...was that their plan all along? Hard to follow!* A lot of 'HOD' in the crew credits...what's that? The name 'Wedge Antiles'
there rang a bell for me...but my knowledge of that kind of detail isn't good.* As the film progressed, I was thinking of scoring it 70% once it started to pick up, then 75% (but giving it 7 out of 10 stars here as is my wont in such circumstances), then 75+%, which would have allowed me to give it 8 stars here. But, like I said at the start, the last 50 minutes or so of the film is good stuff, so I just gave it an unequivocal 80% (and 8 stars).The final order:IIII - Star Wars: A new hope. From before I began reviewing films (as a child I would have given it 11/10!)V - The Empire strikes back*. (* = From before I began reviewing films)IX - The rise of Skywalker. 80%III - Revenge of the Sith. 70%VI - Return of the Jedi?*VIII - The last Jedi. 70%VII - The Force awakens. 65%II - Attack of the clones*. Already forgotten it. YawnI - The phantom menace*. Jar Jar Binks? Awful. Just awful. Podracing? Boring. Just boring.",8,5,20,19 December 2019
Gone Baby Gone," Murky tale with moral ambiguity
","An interesting movie about what happened to a little girl that disappeared, involving characters like the mother of the missing girl, her relatives, the police and private investigators out to find her. The mother of the girl could be characterised as being 'poor white trash' and there are many nasty possibilities as to her fate.Casey Affleck plays Patrick Kenzie, one of the private investigators recruited to find the girl. He disconcertingly looks like the love child of Ben Affleck (his famous brother) and David Byrne, of the band Talking Heads, perhaps. HIs partner in the movie is the lovely Michelle Monaghan, who plays Angie Gennaro, his lover & fellow private investigator.Kenzie's qualities are illustrated in some formulaic scenes which establish his 'tough guy' credentials, as Hollywood leading men are supposed to have.This movie strives to be profound, I think, but it does leave unexamined some Hollywood clichés as to what is right & wrong. In any case, it does serve up some interesting dilemmas to engage the viewer.That is best illustrated by the character of Kenzie. He's meant to be some sort of model of justice and integrity, but really, some of his actions made me squirm and question his morality. The act that most troubled me (and I won't reveal it here) was, I think, a populist appeal to the mob. Plenty of contradictions in Kenzie for people who like their characters complex.This might be a movie best viewed on DVD so that you can go over scenes to nut out what is going on...a device which is used on TV cop shows would have been useful...a guy just summing up what happened, along with a flashback of it. There was some of that in the movie, but it wasn't entirely easy to follow (with regard to the crucial event at the quarry).Gennarro is lovely to look at but isn't very well fleshed out. She does have a crucial dilemma of her own to deal with but I was unconvinced by it, as she was otherwise Affleck's handbag for most of the movie.Dark at times in the subjects it explores...not for the squeamish.",6,0,0,30 May 2008
American Hustle," Dry, arch comedy with a straight face. 72.5+%
","The basic story in this movie is relatively straightforward...a couple of con artists (Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld and Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser) are nabbed by an ambitious F.B.I. Agent (Bradley Cooper as Richie DiMaso) who promises not to charge either of them so long as they can help him catch bigger criminals by using their skills as con artists. Irving and Sydney agree to this...Irving's wife Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence) isn't really privy to all of Irving's activities...illegal or adulterous. The start of the movie informs the viewer that 'some' of the movie is based on actual events. Presumably accuracy hasn't been kept at the expense of good fun.During the movie I frequently laughed out loud as the situation went from bad to worse for Irving and Sydney, or the stupidity of Rosalyn later in the movie (Lawrence shows a talent for character based comedy in this movie). Despite this humour, the movie did strike me as being a dialogue driven piece...a wall of dialogue. It's also 138 minutes long...putting those two things together, it was quite demanding of your attention, perhaps at the expense of just providing pure entertainment. It's not exactly intellectually taxing, just demanding of your attention. Even though I don't usually watch movies again, the thought of watching this movie again due to its demanding nature made me think that I wouldn't want to do that again in a hurry. I'd have to wait a decade, maybe. The way the characters relate to each other perhaps has a 'Brooklyn' vibe to it. Maybe some people might find that taxing too.A way that the movie attempts to keep you intrigued is by making you question the motives of the various players...are Irving and Sydney using each other? What is real? Where does the con begin and end? Who's conning whom? This may provide pleasure for some as a viewing experience.Can't say that I knew how to interpret this movie...initially I missed the introduction explaining that it was partly based on a true story. Without that knowledge, I was wondering whether the movie was a comment on the Hollywood factory (e.g. Bale putting on the bat costume, pretending to be a superhero as a kind of con) or a metaphor for the American dream...in the guise of reinventing oneself to reach higher...if that is indeed the American dream...I'm Australian...I don't know these things. If the latter, maybe that has something in common with the novel 'The great Gatsby', which is regarded as a classic in America and has also been turned into a movie...multiple times. Would still be inclined to think that on some level this movie is 'saying something' about the American experience, beyond merely fictionalising a true story.Another thing that struck me was how often the look of the characters reminded me of other people in movies or TV or real life. E.g. when I caught the start of the movie, with Irving elaborately doing his hair, I was reminded of Tom Cruise in 'Tropic thunder', I think it was; Jeremy Renner as Carmine Polito reminded me of a young Liberace perhaps...or that kind of Teddy Boy look...if that is the right phrase; Louis C.K. as Stoddard Thorsen reminded me of Bill Bailey (the English comedian); one guy kind of reminded me of a young Michael Douglas; there's one mob guy who kind of had a George Clooney in 'O brother, where art thou?' look to him (that I don't remember these character's names just reflects on how demanding of your attention this movie is); Bradley Cooper in one scene (or two) reminds me of Kevin Kline's turn in 'A fish called Wanda'. Sort of related, perhaps Bale channels Gandolfini as Tony Soprano in his performance at times. Jennifer Lawrence sort of reminded me of Renée Zellweger in her looks at times...but maybe that's just me?Speaking of self-referential moments...I got the feeling that a member of the crew had the same surname as the lawyer who appears in the end of the movie...something like 'Tellegio'...if that is the case, perhaps it's a sort of in-joke or something? Maybe there's more of that too?There is some good 1970s music etc. in this movie but it's not quite in the same league as 'Boogie nights' on that front, which was stacked with the kind of songs I love from that era.'American hustle' is a true ensemble work and I suppose in a year in which no particular movie or performance has screamed 'Award!' to me, the extra yards Christian Bale has put in to perform his role (putting on a lot of weight, by the looks of it...assuming it's not a fat suit), he'd be as worth a winner of a Best Actor award as anyone else. In other movies of his I've seen it occurred to me that he was often overshadowed by minor characters in star vehicles for him, like The Dark Knight (Heath Ledger's brilliant turn as the Joker) and Terminator: Salvation (Sam Worthington's character Marcus Wright was more interesting than John Connor). It's perhaps ironic that Bale may win an Oscar in a movie/character which isn't a 'star vehicle' for him. Unlike Batman, Irving is an interesting character...more filling and nutritious, acting chops wise than the caped crusader.One last thingthe endingI did wonder if the film took a morally dubious stance on the targets DiMaso was chasingi.e. not sure that I share those sentiments.",7,1,9,17 December 2013
Rush," Retro style excitement...77.5+%
","I saw an ad for this film in the cinema foyer and I thought to myself that the man in the racing car looked like Niki Lauda. I had no idea who the good looking blonde driver was meant to be though. Maybe that comes into it. Anyway, turns out the ad was for a fact based dramatisation of actual Formula 1 racing car drivers...so, Daniel Brühl already has some credit in the bank for his portrayal of the multi-time world champion Formula 1 driver Niki Lauda. This movie got a good review on 'At the movies' so that also made me more inclined to watch it. However, seeing Australian Chris Hemsworth as the 'other' driver (James Hunt) in the clip for the movie on that TV show made me think that his English accent seemed quite contrived...sort of a clipped, aristocratic accent...I'm thinking ball park Prince Philip territory here! In any case, this wasn't so marked to me in the movie proper, so it wasn't a negative for me.Especially early on, this movie has a sort of comic book feel to the proceedings...or perhaps 'Boy's own adventure' is another way of saying this...perhaps a bit of a 1970s English movie feel to the movie as well...or swinging 1960s style. In other words, it seems pitched more as entertainment than gritty, realistic drama. Personally I found the racing in the movie lacked much detail, insight and intensity, but on occasion the racing presented was all those things...as when Niki Lauda weaves between F1 cars after coming back from the hospital.Where the movie does hold great interest and drama is in the factual information presented to the audience via on screen text...i.e. who won a certain race or what the season leaderboard looks like. It's this aspect which makes the movie engrossing when the actual driving scenes don't. You're made aware of where Hunt stands in relation to Lauda in their fight for the F1 crown.Also fascinating is the insight into the business of racing at this time in the sport's history. You see what Hunt and Lauda were doing before they made it into the big league of racing...their time in Formula 4 (I think it was '4').Watching the movie, it occurred to me that it quite easily have been all about Niki Lauda and his journey. I can't say that I could have associated the name 'James Hunt' with the phrase 'champion F1 driver' but the movie is very informative in making a case for that proposition and justifies its approach of making the theme of this movie the rivalry between these two disparate drivers.In creating an approach based on rivalry it also occurred to me that perhaps the movie fabricated the interactions between these two drivers. On screen, they appear to be in each other's pocket most of the time and I really couldn't believe it was like that in reality. However, at the end of the movie there was some archival footage of Hunt and Lauda chatting to each other at a racetrack, which makes me wonder if there is more truth in this movie than I thought.That being said, there were many times when my credulity did not come easily. For instance, did Hunt really give that reporter an answer like to that to what the reporter asked Lauda at a press conference? Did that actually happen? Did Lauda really watch that on TV when he was receiving treatment? They had televisions in those rooms? Really? Those scenes make for good drama and narrative motivation, but still, I was wondering where truth ended and fiction began. To a lesser extent, I found it hard that Lauda accept the premise of the barbs Hunt would throw at him pre-race at times...surely, if that happened, Lauda would just ignore such a prat, right? If all this stuff happened though, than it is a terrific representation of the duality of Hunt's relationship to Lauda.Overall, this movie is like a philosophical representation of two competing life philosophies...in the form of two extreme, polar opposite personalities. No doubt the middle ground between them would be the ideal in life...perhaps. It would be lovely to think that Hunt and Lauda did have their conversation at Lauda's jet inside the hangar as depicted in the movie. I also liked in that scene how Lauda puts into words something that I was thinking about Hunt's status. Whilst unsure of the actuality of the scene, I also liked how Hunt proffered some home truths to Lauda when the latter unsuccessfully tried to have a race cancelled due to rain.Perhaps it was in 'At the movies' where director Ron Howard admitted having doubts as to whether Chris Hemsworth had the acting chops to pull off this performance. I found Chris performance engaging but he also has a couple of scenes where he gives good reaction shots to the dramas he faces...he really 'inhabits that moment' so to speak.'Rush' has a climactic race between Hunt and Lauda at the end of the movie. Initially I thought Lauda's action implied something, but on reflection I found it a cagey move perhaps worth the gamble, even if the movie posits an entirely different motive for his action.Just in passing, I'll note that Niki Lauda did get referenced in a song by The Music Men on the audience performance segment of the TV show 'Hey hey it's Saturday'. Seeing this movie, it does now seem cruel in retrospect.As mentioned in my opening paragraph, even though I am only slightly aware of F1 history and even less of James Hunt as a player in it, this movie does a sterling job of rectifying that situation.",8,2,4,15 October 2013
Watchmen," A masterpiece
","For a few years now Hollywood has effectively been driving a silver stake through the heart of superhero movies by flogging them to death. 'Watchmen' is a movie which isn't devalued by being released after a spate of superhero movies. For some reason, I've been watching these superhero movies. Sure, I like them, but how many of them have repeat viewing value? Not 'Hulk', but 'Hancock' definitely. In children's movies, 'The Incredibles' was terrific. Not 'The Dark Knight' either, though Heath Ledger's 'The Joker' was the sum total of that movie's greatness.Of all the superhero movies I've seen, 'Watchmen' is the ONLY one I'd call great. The rest look boys' own adventures in comparison.'Watchmen' will not be a movie for everybody. It's hardcore in parts. Here, in Australia, it is rated 'MA'. In my view, an 'R' rating is warranted. There are scenes in this movie that would not look out of place in 'The Texas chainsaw massacre' or 'The day of the dead' or 'Taxi driver'. Perhaps its gore is on a par with the terrific 'Sin City'. The camera does not blink-there is much strong and bloody violence in this movie. Apart from the gore, there are also brutal fight scenes. No punches are pulled.There is full frontal male nudity and sex scenes. 'Watchmen' is also not an ideal 'chick flick' either, as there is a strong rape scene in this movie.So, it's not my intent to put you off seeing this movie. Quite the opposite. Just be prepared for something a lot darker than 'The Dark Knight'. And if my preceeding descriptions of the movie have got you salivating with anticipation, then there is the flipside of this movie...it does try and get profound. More often than not, movies which try and do this bore one witless (as a kid, I remember 'Star Trek: The motion picture' being a terminable bore). However, the intellectual musings of this movie work well...just be aware that it is in this movie, and if it not for you, you will have to wait a while for the 'good stuff'...though the opening of the movie does constitute 'the good stuff' too.OK, how to liken this movie to others which may be touchstones for you? Think of it as part 'Apocalypse now' (for the philosophising on the dark side of man), '2001: A space odyssey' (for general philosophising and delving into 'The Profound') and 'Sin City' or 'Taxi driver' for graphic violence.No, 'Watchmen' is not a movie for the kiddies. It is a very adult movie. It can be confronting if you are lulled into a false sense of security about superhero movies based on what you've recently seen.Without going into the plot too much, it concerns a dystopian world where superheroes are being murdered for some unknown reason, by someone unknown. Having superheroes in a world can't but change the world...in this world, those changes include President Richard Nixon not leaving the White House in disgrace and hence continuing his term for another four years or more.And the superheroes who do inhabit this world give rise to thoughts in the viewer: what is a superhero? Who is a superhero? As far as superheroes go, there is a colourful gang in this movie. Are some/none of them worthy of the moniker 'superhero'?About a week before I saw this film, I bought the comic book it was based on. Did not read it before watching this movie. So, I'm unbiased towards the movie in that I have no preconceptions as to what the movie has to live up to. Like 'The Incredibles', having no great expectations for this movie allowed me to find the greatness in it, without being disappointed by any hype it may have had, or preconceptions. This movie did not disappoint...it exceeded all my expectations. Only a few cheesy glances between some characters struck the wrong note with me. Not enough to put me off this movie.This movie deserves some Academy Award attention in 2009, I think. Like 'Best film', 'Best adapted screenplay' etc. A cast of unknowns does justice to the terrific story.Unlike other superhero movies, this is a movie that will reward repeated viewings. It's depth assures that.Essential viewing...for adults. Enjoy the stunning opening to this movie...and the great music which is employed throughout it.",10,3,6,17 March 2009
American Psycho," Fortunately not as horrific as the novel extract I read
","Many years ago I read an extract in The Age newspaper of Bret Easton-Ellis' novel 'American psycho'. Didn't even manage to real all of it-I found it so absolutely vile I stopped reading it and knew that I would never read that book (the extract was the literary equivalent of coming across those photos from SBS TV autopsy shows in The Age-God knows why The Age feels that a TV guide needs shots of actual autopsies-again and again). The book then and now, presumably, requires it to be wrapped in a plain brown paper bag for taking away after purchase (as it's rated R).Anyway, the other night a commercial network here in Australia screened this movie around midnight. I PVR'd it and watched it soon afterwards. I'm assuming that it wasn't different to the cinema release.The plot: Christian Baile plays Patrick Bateman, a corporate high-flyer in the 1980's (with a touch of the Jim Carreys about him)- a time of corporate piracy and excess. He's about to get married, or so his girlfriend thinks and the petty jealousies at work fill him with such rage that he becomes quite the nasty psycho killer (Quest que cest?). This is the kind of slasher movie which has more in common with Hitchcock's 'Psycho' than Carpenter's 'Halloween'-i.e. you get a fleshed out portrait of the murderer and not some automotan killing machine. As in those movies, it isn't really a gore-fest, though one or two scenes in it are not very pleasant-to do with dismemberment.Apparently the novel was a biting satire of the excess of the times.That does come across in this movie, though I wonder if the book itself says more about the rivalry between artists (Easton Ellis) and the corporate world he seems to despise-in other words, perhaps the sickness of the novel says more about artists as a class than supposedly bad corporate raiders.There are a couple of telling scenes in this movie where others precisely pigeon-hole Bateman and you know they've nailed his character.Bateman is a very odd character-stylised and amusing at times.",6,0,7,19 June 2008
Knowing," Entertaining enough mystery/thriller
","At the start of the movie, a mystery is established: what is going on with a strange primary school girl and the voices she seems to hear? And what is the meaning of a string of numbers she writes down on a sheet of paper to be buried in a time capsule for fifty years?When the time capsule is unearthed fifty years later, and the strange girl's number string comes into the possession of John Koestler's son, Caleb, the mystery is about to resolved. John (played by Nicolas Cage) is a physics teacher who is very good at working out what numbers can mean.There is a thriller aspect to this movie as Caleb (played by Chandler Canterbury) seems to be stalked by some strange, unidentified men. Who are these men? Is Caleb in danger?'Knowing' combines certain pop/cultural strands of philosophy/beliefs in a surprising way...such that you wonder what adherents of either strand would make of this melding of belief systems.Generally, I think that this movie is interesting and entertaining. Doubt that it would have much, if any, repeat viewing value, but as a 'popcorn' movie for a cinema complex, it works fine. There are plenty of exciting special effects (concerning disasters of various kinds), and an engaging premise that piques your curiosity.The ending is sort of interesting too...there is an element of 'wish fulfilment' to it, perhaps appropriate to the times we live in.If some of this movie's elements appeal to you, you may want to seek out 'The incredible shrinking man', which does have some overlap with this movie (though it is slight).Recentish 'blockbuster' movies which have repeat viewing value in my estimation include films like 'Watchmen' and 'Hancock', which I've reviewed here.",7,1,3,9 April 2009
Hugo," Amiable mystery. 75%
","Can't say that I was keen to watch this movie. Reviews gave me the impression that it was aimed at people who had an encylopaedic knowledge of early cinema. Did read an interview in my local tabloid with Chloë Grace Moretz where she mentions fooling the director Martin Scorcese with her English accent when auditioning for her role in the movie. That was a sort of a hook into this film for me (I have seen Chloë in a couple of other movies where some random factoid also provided a 'hook' to see the movie). In any case, Chloë's accent is probably the least interesting aspect of this movie. If you like slow burning mysteries, there's a lot to like here for you.It's the story of the titular boy (played by Asa Butterfield) who is an orphan and lives in a clock tower in Paris. He has certain items which belonged to his father. Part of the mystery is how Hugo got to be an orphan. The other part of the mystery is the relationship between Hugo's father and Georges (played by Ben Kingsley)...they seem to have some connection as evidenced by Hugo's possessions.Georges' story becomes a reverential homage to the history of cinema in the hands of Scorcese (the character of Georges was unknown to me by name alone...so perhaps cinema afficionados would appreciate this movie on 'another level' if the name rings a bell for them). There does seem to be some factual basis to the story so my curiosity is piqued as to how much truth there is to Georges' biography in this movie (concerning what happened to him after World War I)...is there a lot of fact or a lot of wish fulfilment on Scorcese's part? Performances are uniformly strong. Chloë (as Isabelle) has an element of 'jolly hockey sticks' to her performance at times, which seems to be from another movie...if this movie has source material, perhaps this element was diluted in the movie? Wasn't so much of a fan of this aspect to her character. Asa has a very fine moment near the end of the movie where he emotes movingly (to the following person...). Sacha Baron Cohen has a major role as the station inspector where Hugo lives...often coming across as a hybrid between Inspector Clouseau and an Innitman. Some of his physical comedy is good in this movie and I guess that he may have improvised some of his lines...it seems at times that the people he is playing against are genuinely surprised and amused by his utterances. Ben Kingsley also shows many sides to his character and getting a take on his character early on his hard.A weird observation to make, but...looking at Chloë sometimes, she seemed a bit androgynous looking to me (had a touch of the Macauley Culkins to me, it seemed. Maybe she could have been framed better at times...although there is some effective 3D imagery where certain characters are grotesquely framed)...maybe she could play a boy in another movie and win an Oscar? That would certainly be a 'hook'! Isabelle certainly does have an interesting vocabulary...I had to paint the picture myself of how I imagined Hugo would process her utterances...but, again, this element of Isabelle's character is not overplayed, fortunately. Maybe Chloë was miscast, in the following sense...she is a big girl now and towers over Asa...so, unless Asa prefers more mature women...(hmm...tongue in cheek, Isabelle's interest in Hugo does come across as a little bit creepy with that height differential...not sure if any source material has an (probable) age difference like this).One pleasant surprise to me...have read in the past about the very first reactions to cinema, when it was invented...it was nice to be reminded of this in this movie...e.g. the black and white footage of a train pulling into a station.This isn't an action packed movie or a laugh a minute, but it does have an engaging story and people may get a kick out of the footage from the early days of cinema. Maybe I've got a melancholy disposition, but I could have imagined giving this movie a higher score if things took a dark turn towards the end...when Hugo is keen to show Georges something as a surprise.I saw this movie in 3D. Many times the effect is impressively realised through camera movement or framing.",7,4,5,30 January 2012
The Orphanage," Interesting Spanish 'haunted house' story...
","This is a Spanish language 'haunted house' movie with some creepy moments. Belén Rueda plays Laura, who buys as a home with her husband, the orphanage which she used to live in, for a while, as a child. With her is her young son Simón, played by Roger Príncep. Simón has 'the shining', if I can phrase it that way (a reference to another haunted house movie, 'The Shining', which I've reviewed here too). What this means is that Simón seems to be able to perceive ghosts. Of course, the old orphanage has some dark secrets which hang darkly over Laura's new home. When Simón goes missing, you wonder how much credence to give the supernatural overtones of the movie.There is some intellectual stimulation to be had in this movie...the mystery of the orphanage's dark secrets and the fate of Laura's boy. However, I did find myself not really connecting on an emotional level with the story. If you've ever watched the British sketch show 'The fast show', you'll be familiar with the machine gun delivery of the Spanish language. Fortunately, the subtitles are a bit easier to follow!Whether you are a sceptic or a believer in the paranormal, there is bound to be some redeeming features in this movie. I especially liked the 'pay off' at the end, re the eventual fate of Simón. The film is a bit enigmatic and will provide some fat to chew over after the ending. And that ain't bad.This movie isn't a gore fest-it's more a psychological drama, and it has a 'slow burn' pacing to it, so bear that in mind if you see it. Creepy at times, and intriguing.",6,1,2,20 June 2008
The Shining," A scary movie with artistic merit
","This is a movie I highly regard, namely for demonstrating some great artistic merit (some other movies in this category are 'Cat People', 'A clockwork orange' and 'The baby of Macon', which I've also reviewed here).When I first saw this movie as a teenager, I must say I was very disappointed, as it was a movie that was hyped for its shock value, and I didn't find it that shocking.Anyway, the plot of the movie concerns a family who move into a hotel during winter to act as caretakers during the off season. The father is a man who has struggled with alcoholism in the past. His son seems to have some sort of sixth sense, which gives him some very disturbing 'visions' in the hotel.As winter sets in and the isolation becomes more pronounced for the father, he returns to drinking. He starts behaving erratically and violently and may be interacting with his own demons or actual demons in the hotel.I don't want to give away too much more about this movie. In the past, I tended to think of 'The dead zone' as the best adaptation from a Stephen King novel. Having seen The Dead Zone many years later, it struck me as being little more than a midday movie.So, what made me change my mind about The Shining? One scene. It's the scene where the caretaker's son rides his tricycle inside the hotel...over floorboards and carpet. It struck me as great art-the sheer acoustic sensuality of the sound of the wheels travelling over various textures.It's odd, I know, but I really value that kind of art in a movie.The movie does contain some very creepy scenes, so it is not just a horror movie with artistic flourishes. I'm sure that many of the scenes will haunt you for a while.Just by the by, some years ago, I saw a mini-series of this story, which had Stephen King's involvement. I must say, I did find King's own mini-series to be really awful-especially the ending. Normally novellists complain bitterly about directors ruining their vision. In this case, it was all King's doing.",9,1,1,3 June 2008
Wanted," If you believe real world physics is important, this is not for you!
","In classical Greek mythology, three sisters, known as 'The Fates' were responsible for allotting life spans to humans. One of the sisters spun cloth which represented a human life, whilst the last sister cut the cloth, which ended a human's life at some point in time. 'Wanted' offers a variation on this story with a millennium old secret society, known as 'The Fraternity' supposedly reading cryptic writings found from clothe they weave and thus determining who 'fate' has decided to terminate. The Fraternity are assassins with almost super-human capabilities.That is the prelude to this movie. We are then introduced to Wesley Gibson (played by James McAvoy) in the present day. He is a put upon office worker who secretly wishes for a better life. One day it appears that someone is trying to kill him and Fox (played by Angelina Jolie) comes to his rescue and informs him that he is descended from a member of The Fraternity.Eventually Gibson decides he wants to be part of The Fraternity and become an assassin like them. His initiation is very brutal and bloody, so, on that level, this movie isn't really suitable for youngsters as the violence and gore is quite confronting.Stylistically, this movie is a bit like The Matrix...using similar kinds of visual effects. If you like realism in your movies, this popcorn fantasy/action movie wont be your cup of tea. Jolie makes a playful yet deadly assassin-it's an interesting performance.This movie will appeal to people who like to daydream big...here, the central characters are like Greek heroes...demi-gods who dwarf the abilities of ordinary human beings. The Greek connection is also kept up with some plot elements...the story of Wesley Gibson has elements of Greek tragedy to it.You can't honestly say that this movie always makes sense...incredible action scenes will hopefully make you miss all the plot holes of this movie. It's Hollywood style wish-fulfillment. The question is asked of the audience 'What are you doing with your life?'. The script-writers seem to imply that unless you are a highly effective killing machine, your humdrum life is worthless.Presumably writing derivative scripts is a step up from Gibson does for a living.A derivative but enjoyable movie. Very violent though. Not as good as movies it 'borrows' from, like The Matrix etc.69/100",7,2,5,21 August 2008
Salt," An exciting movie you can watch again...
","This is a superior Hollywood blockbuster, engagingly told. Some movies out of America seem to court repeat business by telling the story in an incoherent way (e.g. 'Inception') or by adding a twist that demands you see the movie again to see if it is consistent (e.g. 'The sixth sense'). Well, how about this...here's a movie you can watch again because it's a good story. Nothing more. Nothing less.Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a C.I.A spy. Her life is turned upside down when a former Cold War warrior, Vassily Orlov (played by Daniel Olbrychski) comes into her workplace seeking to defect in return for passing on information useful to the C.I.A. Orlov asserts that Salt is a 'sleeper agent'...someone working for the Russians and who will do their bidding...which will involve dire consequences for America.Salt does her cause great harm by running away, but not before letting her C.I.A. peers know that she is being set up. Orlov had asserted that their sleeper agent - Salt - was to assassinate the Russian President when he attended the funeral of the American Vice-President in America. The question becomes 'Is Salt going to try and prevent the assassination of the Russian president or carry it out like Orlov says she will?'.Almost an hour into the movie I was onto what the real state of affairs was and had formed some hypotheses about the characters and their motives. Which is to say that it was good that the movie kept me guessing for so long about what was going on.The action sequences in this movie are well handled. Cf the incoherent method used in the last James Bond movie 'Quantum of solace'. In fact, this movie comes across as being to Jolie what 'Casino Royale' was to Daniel Craig...an entertaining spy movie. This movie shades the best Bond movies, I think and it also has the advantage of not relying on unbelievable technology like the Bond franchise does. Sure, it has some extraordinary stunt work, but nothing which makes you think you are watching superhero movie.",10,3,9,2 September 2010
Silver Linings Playbook," Mama weer all crazee now. 72.5+%
","This is a very odd, unconventional movie. It's about a man, Pat (played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper seems familiar to me from somewhere...), who is released from a mental institution and who tries to win back the affections of his wife...but she has a restraining order on him! Pat had an undiagnosed mental condition which makes him violent, hence his wife's restraining order. We don't really see much of the wife in this movie. Pat is put into the path of Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence), another damaged personality who also has had dealings with the medical fraternity over her mental health issues.Here's why this movie is so odd and unconventional...Pat is a very unlikeable fellow. It's hard to root for him, hence my lower score. If Cooper was going for a very unlikeable portrayal of a damaged man, then I suppose Oscar recognition is not out of the question. Pat is clueless as far as his interactions with people is concerned and he also lacks self-awareness. Jennifer Lawrence is very sexy in her role (in a Meg Tilly kind of way...but more so) but she isn't a conventional leading lady either. It's hard to imagine what Tiffany sees in Pat...perhaps it's just a case of beautiful people being attracted to each other, even though they may be abrasive personalities (to say the least, especially of Pat)? Lawrence puts together a very strong performance and deserves her Oscar for best actress (I still prefer Naomi Watt's turn in 'The impossible' though, for drawing out powerful emotions from the viewer). I've bumped up my score (and maybe could have given it 75%, say) for the end game of the movie. The leading characters warm, as does the movie, as they/it become more conventional in a rom-com kind of way...you do start to root for the characters. So, eventually, this does turn into a date movie. Robert De Niro as Pat's father (Pat Sr.) is 'interesting'...you can see that Pat Jr. did inherit some of his genes from him! Jacki Weaver as Pat Jr's mother Dolores has some emoting early on in the movie and does give the occasional arch look. Her accent was good (Australians are better at American accents than Americans are at Australian accents)...I don't think she ever lost the accent but maybe once it seemed to lose its flavour. Have heard in the media (perhaps in Australia) that she was nominated for an Oscar in this movie for her performance in the great Australian movie 'Animal kingdom'...which is the way of Hollywood. Chris Tucker as a fellow crazy of Pat the younger is sort of a running gag in this movie. Did find some of the early shots in the movie rather awkward...a bit too self- conscious...perhaps with Weaver, especially. Two of the subplots in this movie were rather odd too...a business sideline of Pat Sr. as well as a 'Strictly ballroom' kind of turn (the Australian movie). Even when the leading actors were being abrasive (early on, especially), there was still much humour to be had in this movie.",7,1,1,25 February 2013
Rocky IV," The nadir of the series
","This was the movie which put me off seeing Stallone movies for years. I was a huge fan of his first three Rocky movies (which I consider to be great/classic) and 'First Blood' (the first of the 'Rambo' movies).In Rocky IV, Stallone turns the inspiring story of a no-name boxer who becomes world champion into part of the Cold War culture battle between the USA and USSR. Every opportunity is taken to portray Russians in an unflattering light...as drug taking cheats or what not (ironic, seeing as how the US Olympic team is now so heavily tainted by the 'drug cheats' smear).Stallone really embraced President Reagan's Cold War views on Russia. After reading some plot details of the sequel to 'First blood', I thought I'd give that movie a miss. I'm still yet to see that movie. Sounds like another Cold War, anti-Russian piece of propaganda. If you are a fan of President Reagan and loved his characterisation of the USSR as an Evil Empire, deserving nuclear annihilation (personally, I didn't find that 'joke' of Reagan's funny, as it smeared an entire people with the muddy term 'evil'), then I think you will have a lot to like in this film. It will confirm all your views about the US and USSR.It wasn't until a couple of years ago, I think, that I finally saw the next installment in this franchise...it was on commercial TV and on very late at night...might have even been the premier of Rocky V! In that film, Stallone, via Rocky Balboa, seems to backtrack from the excesses of Rocky IV. He seems to retract what he was saying in that movie. It was still a very silly movie (no doubt the next worst film in this series), but I'm curious now to see the latest in the franchise, 'Rocky Balboa'. Could be fun.Really, this movie is part of the Stallone oeuvre where you could bill his movies as 'Produced by the Pentagon. Directed by the CIA'. In other words, pure political propaganda, which played a part in Reagan's Cold War against the USSR.The nadir of the series.",1,32,74,4 July 2008
Dark City," Intriguing sci-fi
","This is one of my favourite movies of a spate of movies dealing with philosophical themes. This group would include The Matrix (reviewed here by me), The Thirteenth Floor and Gattaca.I saw this movie many years ago and it has stuck with me all this time. Don't be put off by my description of these movies as 'philosophical'-they are entertainment first and foremost.The philosophical theme of this movie is, I suppose, the old chestnut of nature versus nurture. Is there an 'essence' to human identity? To use a different example than that in the movie...if Hitler as a young child was reared in religious orphanage or some such, would he have ended up a jolly good chap? Or was he a bad seed who would still give forth rotten fruit? I suppose the flip-side of that would be how the Pope would have fared had he been placed in Hitler's circumstances.The movie deals with these kinds of themes in its own, intriguing way. I don't want to get into much more detail than this.I did read a review of this movie in the Halliwell film guide, I think, and was surprised how low it scored. Not sure, but perhaps the reviewer was misguided into thinking this film lightweight when it is so much more than that. Again, Halliwell seemed to give many poor reviews for movies that I would consider masterpieces, especially Australian movies like Mad Max 2 and Bad Boy Bubby. American snobbery perhaps?This is a terrific genre movie that should not be missed...along with the other movies that I mentioned above.",10,7,12,3 June 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man," The untold story begins...again...
","When I walked out of the theatre after seeing this movie, I saw the poster for it, which had the tagline 'The untold story begins'...to which the appropriate response is: 'Again?'. In another ten years they could again have another origin story for Spider-Man and use the same tagline again.I'm not that familiar with Spiderman lore, but I did read recently that this origin story is more in keeping with one of the comic book iterations of this story...perhaps the first comic book series? So, basically, it's a tweaking of the Tobey Maguire incarnation as the hero. Someone on the internet did call me an idiot many years ago for saying that I saw a Spiderman movie in the cinema where the hero, Peter Parker, gained his powers by a bite from a radioactive spider. That person just didn't believe that I saw this. In any case, genetic engineering is more 'current' in our society, so bites from radioactive spiders is out.Can't say that I remember, but I probably liked Tobey Maguire's turn as Spider-Man better. Perhaps if I'd seen this current version first, the situation would be reversed. In any case, Andrew Garfield is very good in the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man...but he did strike me as having a very Tobey Maguire type of vibe to his performance. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is also good in her role as Peter Parker's love interest. And, again, she is very reminiscent of Kirsten Dunst in her role as another love interest for Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man (a different character though...hence why this origin story is slightly different to Tobey Maguire's version). One annoying thing about this movie is the piling on of coincidence after coincidence as far as how some characters keep popping up in places where they are likely to meet Peter Parker...or indeed for having a relationship to people Peter Parker/Spider-Man has 'conflict' with.My biggest bugbear is the ancient cliché of the superhero displaying extraordinary powers in a sporting context. I'm Australian, so basketball or gridiron holds no interest for me. So, it's just so face-palming to see Peter Parker excel in those sports. No doubt it's aimed at the younger demographic for this movie...providing the lesson that yes, boys, you too can become an athletic superstar...with a little help from superpowers...and genetic engineering...and anabolic steroids too? This awful cliché reached its nadir in 'Bionic showdown' where an American human/machine hybrid won a gold medal at the Olympics...yuh...no cheating there, sir!The end of this movie does have a narrative hook to keep you watching sequels but I'm not sure that that will be enough to make me fork out to see it. Denis Leary as a prominent policeman in this movie was good for laughs and would have been a welcome return for any sequel.A solid movie but the similarities to the Tobey Maguire incarnation are too fresh for me to get that much out of the movie...not sure, but I may have bailed on the Maguire franchise after the first sequel...these kinds of movies tend to peter out, interest wise, pretty quickly. For those new to the franchise, it's a likable origin story with some good casting and acting.",7,1,3,24 July 2012
The Exorcist," Classic horror tale
","This movie is one of the all time great horror movies. Time may have rendered some of the scenes unintentionally funny, but it still provides a terrific template in how to construct an adult horror movie.There are a few different versions of this movie around - three, I think. The last time I saw this movie (some years ago) might have been with the anniversary edition. You'd do well to avoid the version with the silly subliminal flashes (that might be the extended version of the movie).Anyway, the movie is about a single parent family...a mum and her young teen daughter (the daughter is played by Linda Blair). The daughter slowly starts acting more and more alarmingly. What is so terrific about the movie is how the mum acts rationally to help her daughter...taking her to doctors in a desperate bid to cure her daughter.Eventually, the daughter's behaviour becomes so disturbing that she eventually consults a priest in a last desperate attempt to cure her daughter.The movie contains a lot of graphic language and has some disturbing sexual imagery, so it isn't really suitable for young teens. Also, if you are a Christian, you may find this movie disturbing too.Like I've said, the movie may have lost some of its power in this secular day and age, and some of the horror that was so shocking for the 1970s seems a tad ludicrous now, but the extremely intelligent way that this movie is constructed is a master-class for modern day horror makers who think that jumping straight into a gore-fest is somehow scary or satisfying.",10,4,7,3 June 2008
Now You See Me," Substantial style but what's it all about Alfie? 77.5%
","Fortunately the answer to my headline question is provided in the movie. I was tempted to headline this review as 'The closer you look the more you see' as the opposite is often asserted in this movie concerning magic...i.e. 'The closer you look the less you see'.Anyway, the plot of this movie concerns a group of disparate magicians who are brought together by a mysterious person and instructed to follow directions without question. These directions involve making money disappear, which leads to police interest in their activities.There are many herrings provided in this movie. It would be inaccurate to say, I think, that you can deduce the identity of the mystery organiser but the movie does often throw out little titbits which are fun to make you surmise who knows more than they are letting on. I was half expecting a revelation a la 'The usual suspects' as to who the mystery mastermind was. In any case, that revelation came as a surprise to me. Of some consolation to me was that I guessed (or at least was open to the possibility) of how the final heist in the movie was achieved, no doubt thanks to a little titbit on how a previous magic trick in the movie was accomplished...but, thinking more about that latter trick, I doubt that it would actually work in the way you see it in the movie! The closer you look, the more you see it doesn't stack up!Maybe it was on 'At the movies' where I heard the suggestion that 'Now you see me' is structured like a magic trick...all misdirection and sleight of hand. Not sure that that is right. It seems pretty conventional...insofaras all movies utilise camera angles and editing and plotting to create an illusion of coherent narrative. These movie tricks make it seem that something extraordinary is occurring whereas if you pulled back, you might see, for instance, that a very dangerous looking car stunt was actually very safe and only camera angles and editing made it look life threatening.Like I said initially, I was inclined to headline this review as 'The closer you look the more you see'. By that I mean the movie has plot holes which make the illusion disintegrate once you analyse them. One would think that the use of captions in the movie would be a sign of objectivity, but it seems to me, from memory, that even they misdirect...e.g. that scene early on in the movie where a French man takes part in an onstage magic trick. The caption used for that scene seemed a quite obvious case of misdirection (but I'm relying on my memory here as to what those captions assert).To the extent that I have a 'problem' with this movie is the very Hollywood like leaps faith required to make the story gel...hence my comment that the closer you look at things the more they fail to make sense. Maybe a movie like 'The game' is another example of this...there is a certain sense of implausibility when 'going with the flow' of this movie. The illusion is quite fun though, once you focus on the 'big' picture...and not get bogged down in details like how anybody could have the ability of foresight required by the plot of the movie.My headline also states that this movie has substantial style...a play on 'style over substance'. That would be my only quibble with this movie and why it does't score higher...since it doesn't hang together logically that much, you really want the principle magicians at the heart of this movie to sweep you off your feet with their charisma and make you swoon. They don't quite make you forget the artifice of this movie but they do display wit on occasion...but a bit more chutzpah would have been nice. Maybe it's also a pity that later on in the movie it becomes clear that the magicians have actually crossed the line between seeming to be criminals and actually qualifying as such.",8,0,2,20 August 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," The Chuck Norris story (Part I: The early years)
","An entertaining movie that can be interpreted as a biography of Chuck Norris in his early twenties. Presumably Chuck was taking lots of drugs at that time because if he saw this movie now he'd be thinking to himself 'Did that happen to me or did I dream it?'.The unbridled machismo glimpsed in star Michael Cera's role in 'Juno' is brought to fruition here. You really do believe that he is Chuck Norris...the pain...the rage...the dread that he will go berko on you...and maybe teabag you.Speaking of Juno...if you thought that that could have been a really good movie...if it had kick-boxing, then this movie will be your cup of tea.Anyway, in this movie Scott Pilgrim/young Chuck Norris is 'between jobs' and spends his (nothing but) spare time in his band 'Sex Bob-Omb', where he plays bass guitar. The more savvy reader will have noted the Buddhist chant pun in the band's name. This movie does have a lot of music in it. And it's interesting to listen to...sort of garage-punk. Beck Hansen wrote much of the music and it's fine in its own right.So anyway, Scott/young Chuck has found himself a schoolgirl girlfriend, but complications ensue when he meets Ramona Flowers/young Edna Everage. Dilemma. If Scott/young Chuck want to be with Ramona/young Edna, he has to fight a series of ex-boyfriends of Ramona/young Edna. The fight scenes are modelled on video games and is where Scott/young Chuck gets to amp up the machismo and kick-boxing to 11.74.Some of the scenes are 'cute'...i.e. you might see one conversation between people played out in different places over different periods of time. It's sort of dream like in that way.I'm not sure that this movie will have a lot of repeat viewing value in a short space of time, but it was entertaining first up and would be worth revisiting after a spell.It's funny, cute and comically violent. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona really nails the Edna Everage look...when Edna was in her prime. And who knew young Chuck Norris wrote love songs and sang them to his woman...on acoustic guitar? Fans of Seinfeld might like this too...remember that episode where George plays Frogger for real? This movie is like that. And as in Seinfeld, you get a lot of fun peripheral characters...like Scott/young Chuck's gay room-mate.",8,2,11,24 August 2010
Enchanted," Lacks the adult appeal of classics like 'The Princess Bride'
","Starting off a standard Walt Disney cartoon and then transforming into a live action movie, this is the story of 'true love' and those that would seek to deny it for their own reasons.The one seeking to deny others the chance of true love is the handsome Prince Edward's step-mother, Queen Narissa (voiced and then played by Susan Sarandon). She's a nasty piece of work because she fears losing her title as 'Queen' if her step-son marries the likely lass that has taken his fancy-Giselle. Hence, by magic the evil step-mother banishes Giselle to non-cartoon New York, in order to separate the would be lovers.My main problem with this movie and the reason I am giving it a low score is that this movie is very much pitched towards children and lacks the cross-over appeal of such great 'G' rated movies like 'The princess bride' and 'The Incredibles' (the former a classic and delightful comedy/fairy-tale, whilst the latter was a cartoon that I saw without great expectations and which impressed me). The latter films provide a reason to have kids!The actress playing/voicing Giselle, along with the other fairytale originating characters, play the live action scenes as if they were in a pantomime. It's a performance pitched at the very youngest of audiences.On the other hand, oddly, you get a very dour and 'realist' performance by Patrick Dempsey (of the medicated soap 'Grey's Anatomy', I think)-playing a character who complicates the situation with the would be lovers.At times I felt this movie tending to drag and I found myself cringing at some of the musical numbers (I'm not that into musicals though). However, in the movie's favour, there were a around a handful of laughs to be had. The film does poke fun at the whole 'fairytale' genre at times.There were a lot children at this screening and whilst they weren't riotously entertained they did enjoy some musical numbers and jokes.For the kiddies.",5,1,7,3 July 2008
Yesterday," I've a feeling Toto might not be able to tour in Kansas anymore. 75+
","As someone who regards The Beatles as the greatest pop-rock act of all time, the prospect of seeing a film which imagined a world in which they didn't exist but one in which somebody else gets to take the credit for their music was one which I found to be...appealing. Maybe there are some Beatles fans who feel the opposite way to me? In any case, I enjoyed this amusing film and would suggest that it would mostly appeal to people who are fans of romcoms and also fans of The Beatles, who don't take umbrage at other acts singing their songs. If you are unfamiliar with The Beatles, then, I'd say that this film will mostly be conceptual humour to you, as the jokes won't make sense many times if you don't know the band's lyrics or status in popular music.The high-concept premise of the film has Jack Malik (played by Himesh Patel) as a wannabe singer-songwriter, who has an attractive manager in Ellie Appleton (played by Lily James) who believes in his talent. Jack regards Ellie as a friend and is oblivious to her romantic feelings for him. Jack's music 'career' is going nowhere, fast and he is ready to give up on his dream. As to be expected, cliché of clichés, a narrative event intervenes to turn things around. Having read a synopsis of the plot somewhere, I was expecting the kind of scenario found in the film'The wizard of Oz'.As a result of a global 'weather' event, Jack is injured and wakes up in hospital to find that his Beatles allusions are being met with incomprehension (as such weather events are wont to do). Having proved to his own intellectual satisfaction later on that, yes, The Beatles are no longer a thing in his world, he is put into a very interesting position...he knows a lot of their music...what should he do with that knowledge?After putting out some Beatles' songs in the public domain - not attributed to them, of course - Jack finds himself in the orbit of the non-fictional singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran (played by himself). Some reviews of this film note that Sheeran's own story parallels that of Jack's, in some ways (Himesh Patel would seem an unlikely choice to be the star in this kind of film). Jack finds himself in a position, subsequently, to try and achieve global stardom. A lot of amusing scenes are to be had with Jack's wannabe American manager, Debra Hammer (played by Kate McKinnon), who is...blunt (to put it kindly!).Early on in the film, when Jack plays Beatles' songs before a crowd, there is indifference. This state of affairs isn't really explored as a possibility. Being a fan of The Beatles' music would lend itself to the view that this band's music is transcendent and universally 'great'. I would put myself in the position of most of the world's citizens in 'Yesterday' as far Ed Sheeran goes. I can't say that I know the names of any of his songs although I could get lucky and be able to pick a song on the radio as being one of his...probably just the one song. What pushed my review of this film from 75/100 to 75+/100 (and hence receive a bump in my score from 7 stars out of 10 stars on this site to 8 stars...I don't round up otherwise) was hearing perhaps my favourite Beatles' song in its entirety during the closing credits. Looking behind me, I noticed that people were walking out of the cinema at this point and by the end of the song it was just me there, basically. I did find that sad, really. I'm normally one to stick around for the closing credits in any case (sometimes there are Easter eggs in them!). This experience maybe reflects on the premise of the film about the stature of The Beatles. Speaking of which, it did seem to me that their music was (or had) disappeared from commercial radio ('Classic Hits' stations perhaps moving onto the next decade of music, as they did with the likes of Elvis Presley et al.). It's my impression that the TV documentary series 'The Beatles anthology' revived their fortunes in this respect. That series saw the release of a 'new' song which I regarded as one of my favouring Beatles' songs ever, 'Real love'.Whilst the high-concept of this film was a drawcard for me, I don't think that the authors/writer of this story (including Richard Curtis, who wrote the screenplay for the hit film 'Four weddings and a funeral' which I enjoyed) have fully understood the ramifications of this concept. For instance, in the world in which Jack finds himself now, trying to attribute ownership of 'Jack's songs' to The Beatles could have the following consequences: Jack being viewed as insane or Jack as making the ultimate 'concept album'. The comedy might not flow from the first possibility but having thought of it afterwards, the latter possibility is something that I wish the authors/writer had thought to canvas! Also, for the film's dénouement, I did think that Jack might give Ed a gift, which would put Ed in an interesting position too! Basically, one issue that I have with this film was that it raises more questions than anything.Now, to aspects of this film that I enjoyed:* There are two people who form a 'strange couple' later on in the film, who Jack meets after a performance, I think. It wasn't clear to me how that would go, but I like what they did with this.* One unexpected character is visited by Jack. Not sure how others will feel about this but it worked for me. Again, how does this relate to the film's concept?* Amusing product placement-alternate reality facts.* Liked impact on Sheeran of Jack's 'genius'.* The trailer for this film seemed to have a scene which I didn't see in the film itself, namely, where Jack 'spontaneously' writes a song on a talk show and sings it to a female guest.I've reviewed 'The Beatles: Eight days a week - The touring years' here.",8,1,2,5 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," New endings. New beginnings. 65+%
","A satisfactory finale to 'Avengers: Infinity war', which surprised me, as I scored the earlier film a 4/10 on this site.Why the improvement? Well, even though I hadn't kept up with the other films in this franchise (i.e. the Marvel Cinematic Universe) before seeing 'Avengers: Endgame' (which was no different to how I saw 'Avengers: Infinity war', this time I didn't feel as though I was missing important information or events from those MCU films which I hadn't seen. So, even though I hadn't seen the current 'Captain Marvel' film and she appears in this film, there just didn't seem to be anything that I was missing by not having seen that other film. That wasn't the case so much with the Ant-Man character, but I wasn't really bothered by not getting the payoff which I presume was intended from him.Since this is the finale to a sequence of MCU films, I won't bother outlining the story so far...you should at least have seen the previous Avengers films in order to be contemplating watching the finale. So, I'll just note some things which struck me, watching this film...it may, therefore, be more interesting to people who have already seen this film.General observations:* Whilst the film was generally satisfying, I doubt that it would stand up well to repeated viewings, as it isn't particularly briskly paced or action-packed (not that these are necessarily bad things, especially given how boring Hollywood films can be when they go down that route).* I wasn't a fan of the treatment of Thor in this film. Even though I've never read a Thor comic, or watched further than the first film of his own franchise, I have to say that the humour revolving around him didn't work for me. He comes across as a plummy sounding Englishman who watches way too much LA based teen comedies or something. Some of the humour was conceptual, though...in the way that Monty Python can be conceptual...your head recognises the joke but you just don't laugh. I didn't mind his pun near the end of the film though, concerning another MCU franchise. I am curious whether Chris Hemsworth went 'method' for this role though, or whether CGI was used instead.* Another big problem with the film is that it just lacks storytelling smarts, as far as the action sequences go, although that flaw is pretty much endemic to every action film ever made. The second Lord Of The Rings film, I think, conquered that common failing, in that the war scenes displayed military strategy and tactics in a dramatic and engrossing way...but perhaps that had more to do with the nature of the military technology utilised in that story? To paraphrase this point, I'm saying that you don't really get scenes where you feel that your favourite Avenger is kicking goals, so to speak (and as I don't feel particularly invested in any of the characters, this didn't bug me so much). You don't even feel as though they are in mortal danger. All you get is countless thousands of CGI fighters engaged in battle, as is Hollywood's wont. There was a missed opportunity to create drama in those set pieces. For instance, much drama could have been made of Ant-Man's abilities and how they could avert a catastrophic loss of lives amongst the forces of good. You really don't get much on that front though...you see a little bit of tactics but no drama there, whatsoever.* Connoisseurs of time travel stories might enjoy the proceedings of this film, as there is much meta-discussion about the merits of the logic of other time travel stories known to popular culture. For all I know, the theory of time travel espoused in this film might be as absurd or incomprehensible as that of any of the films that the characters in 'Avengers: Endgame' critique. The discussion is interesting nonetheless and I may try to find the script for this film in order to become more familiar with the ideas presented in it.* CGI plays a big part in this film, as I've already mentioned with regard to the battle scenes. It also plays a part on a more intimate level. For instance, I recognised John Slattery as the actor playing one of the characters in the film. He seemed too young though for it it to be him. I'm not sure whether CGI was used for him (maybe they just used conventional special effects?)...or whether John has discovered a new facial cream with wonderfully restorative properties for his skin. Speaking of John...his character has possibly the most bizarre handshaking technique ever represented on film. It also seems to me that Robert Redford got an even bigger CGI treatment for this film than Slattery did.* I doubt that anything at all hinges on a comment that one character made in this film, but it sounds like it should...'We deal with it by not dealing with it'. I'd be interested to know if the relevant MCU franchise ('The Black Panther') will revisit this comment.* The comment about Doctor Strange 'giving away' one of the Infinity Stones intrigued me. If that was in the previous Avengers film, I've forgotten about it. Maybe I should remind myself of the circumstances of that event? In any case, I'm not sure that this film sheds light on why he might have done that. Or did I miss something?* Since this instalment of the 'Avengers' franchise serves as a bookend, I wonder whether I can be tempted back to the MCU sometime, given that the MCU is very hit-and-miss, and mostly misses, it seems to me. If I can't, then not a bad way to end this fling with Marvel.* Curious about any lore concerning who may wield Thor's hammer.",7,0,4,1 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," Nothing special...disposable installment of the series
","Having seen the first of the Daniel Craig 007 movies and enjoying it, I was looking forward to this sequel. It was at the cinema that I saw Craig's first up effort 'Casino Royale' and I hadn't seen the film again. So, going into the sequel cold, I must say how disjointed it all felt. None of the baddies in the movie rung any bells for me, so I didn't really get a sense of this movie being a sequel, with Bond seeking vengeance on his girlfriend's murderers. Maybe the baddies in this movie weren't in the first movie, which would explain it.If this movie is meant to be about Bond getting revenge, it doesn't really function well on that level either. Sure, it has the usual quota of action set pieces, but nothing memorable...like my first Bond movie, 'For your eyes only' which had that classic scene of Bond driving a Mini at full speed down a winding hill road, backwards. Even 'Casino Royale' had that daring foot chase scene in some dangerous locations.The editing in this movie is hyper-kinetic. It's quite plausible, I think, to have this style of editing used to great effect-e.g.to create the illusion of something spectacular having happened when it would be very hard or expensive to actually do it (say for car chase sequences where dodging other cars is an issue), however, here the method is merely disorientating. You know something exciting is happening...you just don't know what it is...the camera spins and swoons and you're never really quite sure what is going on. Action fans may feel cheated by this. On 'At the movies', the director explained that he wanted to put his own personal style on the movie. Personally, I don't think that this 'style' is very personal or effective.Lastly, this just doesn't seem like it's following on directly after 'Casino Royale' and it lacks the old Bond movie highlights of a great opening sequence (a la the Moore years) and a great title theme (with the likes of the legendary Shirley Bassey singing the theme to more than one Bond movie.Action aplenty, signifying nothing.P.S. I have recently rewatched this movie the day after rewatching 'Casino Royale' again. This method does improve the coherence of the story (but not of the editing and cinetography, unfortunately!). So, I'd recommend watching this film soon after watching 'Casino Royale'. In that case I'd give this movie 75/100. It's a good story, with realistic evil schemes...just spoiled by incoherent and pretentious cinematography and editing.",6,2,3,18 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," A good film, but maybe just a tad over-rated?
","A modern day Greek tragedy...without a flawed hero-more of a flawed anti-hero. Josh Brolin plays Llewelyn Moss the complex man with more than one flaw and with some of them being a bit contradictory. He opportunistically comes across a large sum of money after stumbling across a drug deal gone wrong and he makes away with it. Now, you could argue which flaw of his is the most culpable or primary, but in any case he ends up having to watch his back as he is now being pursued by a similary complex crime syndicate gun for hire-Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem.On the 'good guy' side of the equation is law enforcer Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He has to nut out exactly what transpired at the scene of the awry drug deal and how people fit into the puzzle.This is a superior crime drama with fine, subtle performances by Brolin, Bardem and Jones. Garret Dillahunt as Sheriff Bell's sidekick, Deputy Wendell, provides some comic relief, as in the writers' other crime drama 'Fargo'. Kelly Macdonald, who plays Carla Jean Moss (Llewelyn Moss' wife) has a lovely, wifely Southern charm. The only false note in this film is by Woody Harrelson who plays Carson Wells, a peer of Chigurh, the man hunting Llewelyn. Harrelson seems to be playing a young Colonel Sanders or some such-a bit too showy for my liking.It's the strangeness and surreality of the characters which makes this movie so appealing. You can't help wondering what certain characters were thinking-Llewelyn for instance...or the guy stopped by Chigurh when he is driving a police car 'Would you stand still?'..what the? Come on man...if you saw Chigurh in that situation wouldn't you wonder....There are some gory scenes in this movies but it's more of a dramatic thriller with great characters.Since the performances were so wonderfully subtle, I can't say that any performance in this movie screams 'Best Actor' Academy Award (unlike, say, Sean Connery in 'The untouchables').I enjoyed this film, but can't really say that it is the masterpieces it is being described as.",7,0,2,3 July 2008
District 9," Return of the oppressed. 75/100
","This is a superior sci-fi movie, which comes across as a documentary feature, with 'talking heads' interviews, and some hand-held video taping. However, some of the point of view shots make any notion that some scenes were actually part of the documentary ridiculous.Pointedly set in South Africa, the 'documentary' tells of a massive alien 'mother ship' hovering over the capital of South Africa, Johannesburg. This movie could easily have been set during the 1960s in the US, as far as political commentary goes. However, 'apartheid' ended more recently in South Africa than it did in the US. Anyway, we get to see the aliens which live in slums in Johannesburg, as well as their technology, and the talking heads speculate about what is going on why a certain corporation from their country is involved with the aliens. It's this kind of speculation which lifts this above the 'B movie' realm.The central character in this 'documentary' is Wikus Van De Merwe (played by Sharlto Copley). Wikus looks and acts like a South African version of Murray Hewitt (played by Rhys Darby) in the TV sit-com 'The flight of the conchords'. So, to that extent, this movie does have some light-relief as well as some poignant drama. Wikus is a bureaucrat charged with relocating the unwelcome aliens, so he has direct contact with the funny odd looking aliens from space.Overall, this is a good movie. If you like this movie, some movies which have overlapping themes and which you may like include: Laserblast and 'The fly' (the remake).",8,0,1,27 August 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Return of the form...
","Have to say that I went into the cinema with a feeling of trepidation for this sequel, seeing as how weak and dull I found the first installment. It wouldn't have surprised me if it was as bad as the first one, which would have put in mind George Lucas' Star Wars prequels (where the final chapter was the only decent one of the lot) or The Matrix sequels, which diminished the legacy of the first one.In any case, I'm happy to report that the trilogy is on track now, which is a good thing...I can't imagine being motivated to continue watching the trilogy if the first two were plain rubbish.Even though I haven't refreshed my memory of the first one (why would you?), I sort of bluffed my way into the sequel, despite wondering on occasion whether this was the sequel to the great 'Lord of the rings' trilogy or the prequel. So, for those of you playing at home, it might help to watch the movies in quick succession so you don't forget the narrative. The sequel doesn't make things easy for the absent viewer by jumping straight into the middle of things without a preamble along the 'Previously on The Hobbit...' line.The movie was pretty action packed but not in a bad way. It was all entertaining stuff in other words. Can't say that I was engrossed/entranced by the story, but I liked how it was on track as far as the major threads of the story go (the dwarfs quest to reclaim their kingdom and vanquish the dragon living there now). Speaking of the dragon, into this movie I was wondering what a 'Smaug' was...one of the cons of only seeing these movies during their cinema runs. 'Interestingly', I 'learned' in the first movie that dragons 'covet' gold. In this movie I learned that dragons can speak. I initially thought that this was an effect of the ring worn by Bilbo Baggins, but turns out not to be the case. It kind of made more sense if you attributed that power speech to the ring (...!).One thing I liked about the movie included star of 'Lost' Evangeline Lilly's turn as an Elf...she was quite nice as an Elf.Managed to recognise some actors in this movie...picked Stephen Fry right away, despite all his makeup, as well as Sylvester McCoy, but that may have been due to having recently watched 'Doctor Who: The ultimate guide'...because I'm pretty sure McCoy must have played the same character in the first movie. I also thought that perhaps Fry did the voice for Smaug in this movie, but I was mistaken on that front.In my review of the first movie of this trilogy, I go into the things that bothered me about it. For this movie, I suppose the best that I can come up with is to question whether barrels really do have the floatative properties that they have in the movie. Hmm...actually, I forgot to mention how the Elves in this movie seem to knock the Orcs down like ninepins. Hell, one Elf would seem capable of taking out an entire Orc army!Just a minor observation...I could have sworn I saw the infamous name 'Alan Smithee' in the credits...around the bottom, right hand side of the credits...but now that I think about it, maybe it was in that section...I do remember reading somewhere that the director makes an appearance in this movie...so, perhaps he didn't use his real name? If this movie had turned out as bad as the first then it would have been fair enough for good ol' Smithee to take the credit for the directing in this movie too!Hopefully the final chapter of this trilogy will really make up for the poor start...something which really captures the imagination more and engrosses you. Whilst this movie was entertaining, it felt more like it was joining the dots as far as action and narrative check points were concerned. I'd like to be absorbed by the next movie and not just entertained.One last thing...I mentioned the Easter egg of the director's appearance in this movie...I also remember reading somewhere, I think, that Peter Jackson included a character from LOTR who doesn't feature in The Hobbit. Perhaps it was Legolas. Maybe that's a bit of a plot hole? As in, is it coherent that Legolas would be in that part of the world at that particular point in time? Since its been a while since I saw the LOTR trilogy and the first Hobbit movie, I have to say that at times I wondered 'Is that Legolas? Or is it the other blonde guy?'. They kind of looked similar.",8,2,6,7 January 2014
Toy Story 4," I wonder if this film will give very young children nightmares! 80%
","It's been years since I saw the last Toy Story sequel, which was Toy Story 3, I suppose (I had to look up the Wikipedia entry for that earlier film to see if the plot rang any bells for me). It sounded vaguely familiar, so I just might have seen them all by now. Perhaps the fact that I can't really recall any of the previous films in the series doesn't speak too well of them. Sure, I could recognise a photo of Woody, or Buzz Lightyear etc, if you had showed them to me prior to watching this latest instalment. On a good day, I could have even have remembered their names! It should be noted that I saw the series as a young adult at the cinema, not an impressionable child.That being said, I'm guessing that this is the best film in the series. It has quite mature themes of love, loss and sacrifice.The plot revolves around the group of toys' new owner (I'd forgotten their old one, to tell you the truth!) a young girl called 'Bonnie', adjusting to life starting kindergarten for the first time. Finding it difficult to fit in at kindergarten, Bonnie creates a toy from a plastic spork (i.e. a cross between a spoon and a fork, used at fast food restaurants). She becomes very attached to it and is unaware of its existential crisis caused by it being made into a toy.Soon after, Bonnie's family embark on a road trip, with her toys. Plenty of drama ensues.Now, to why I wonder whether this film might be scary to very young children:Things are decidedly creepy in an antique store some of Bonnie's toys visit on their road trip. As an adult, I was amused by a jump scare, which fans of adult of horror movies would be used to. No doubt completely going over the heads of children, there was, I think, the use of a song which can be heard in the classic adult horror film 'The shining' (based on Stephen King's novel of the same name).Two toy characters, who sound like African Americans, are almost psychopathic, one could say! They fantasise about being violent to humans and in one scene, it was implied (or I had inferred) that they had killed a human. Intended to be comical characters, they do strike me as an odd choice to include in a film aimed at young children, especially.Why do I mention this? Years ago I heard of a review in the US media about the Australian film 'Babe: Pig in the city' which commented that it would be scary for children to view. Not having seen that film, I can't comment about that criticism, however, if you feel such criticisms are important to flag, then I've just done that here.As an adult, I was amused by parts of the film. There is some slapstick humour to it. At least once I had a literal 'laugh-out-loud' moment. I also appreciated the subtlety of the film. For instance, at times the dialogue would make you realise that what you'd heard before was ambiguous, and the later dialogue would disambiguate what you had heard before. That was nicely done in a scene involving the toys Woody, Buzz and Bo Peep, near the end.Random observations:* There is a scene in the film inside the antique store. It struck me as having video game potential...kind of like a Toy Story meets Metal Gear Solid game.* ...what some of the toys do to a young man running a game of chance at the carnival struck me as being...somewhat socialist in nature! Bad for business, surely!* The closing credits has an 'R.I.P' for Don Rickles. Looking at Wikipedia's entry for this latest film now, I see that they used archival audio for his character's dialogue.In conclusion, since I can't remember much of the preceding films' content (and former The Age newspaper columnist Jim Schembri's hope that Toy Story 3 be the last in the franchise as he liked it so much), I'd say that Toy Story 4 is the perfect ending to this story. I like how it has ended and I'm not really sure where the creatives can go to from here to keep milking this cash cow. Sequels would be contrived and any 'final' film in the franchise would, no doubt, be subject to the studio not wanting to milk the series for more money...in which case they could reboot it...or start a new franchise with different characters...with maybe some cameos from the original series. I dunno.N.B. I was going to give this film a score of 75+% but I've bumped that up to 80% just for the scene involving Duke Caboom's last jump on his motorbike!",8,0,2,26 July 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Amusing with some nostalgia value. 77.5%
","It's hard to imagine who this movie is pitched at, as most of the humour arises from nostalgia for old video games which the target audience (children) would no doubt be ignorant of. In the cinema, I can't say that I heard a lot of reaction from the children watching this movie (which isn't to say that they didn't enjoy it...maybe they did). If you haunted amusement arcades back in the day or played on old consoles, then you should have fun with this movie...you just might have to convince your children (or grandchildren!) that there's something in it for them!The movie's premise is like that of 'Toy story'...an animated cast of characters from video games come alive when the arcade closes and lead an independent life. I did get a laugh out of things like a big exclamation mark appearing over one character's head...a pop cultural reference I am sure would go over the heads of the young viewers in the audience (from the 'Metal gear solid' series of games).There was one scene which made me enquire what rating the movie had...there's a scene where a zombie character has his heart literally ripped out by another character and paraded briefly, like a trophy. This was the only moment when I was aware of the audience reaction...it was pretty much along the lines of 'Ewww!'. The movie is rated 'PG' in Australia, which I suppose might be reasonable. Since no small children were obviously scarred for life by this scene, maybe I am just being too concerned about the 'appropriateness' of such content in this movie?Themes in this movie are good food for the target audience (children) to chew over...overcoming other people's perceptions or expectations for you; self-belief; the value of duty; trust; ulterior motives; assigned roles etc. The titular character in this movie has to deal with some of these issues...in a video game is 'the bad guy'...the one who destroys things. He'd like to be the good guy for once so enters other games in order to achieve this.Eventually it dawned on me that one of the voice cast for this movie was 'Ken' from the sitcom '30 Rock' (Jack McBrayer).The female character of 'Glitch' was one who I found engaging and she also has to deal with some of those themes I outlined above...she's something of interest for young female viewers no doubt...although one of her jokes at the end of the movie did seem quite dark too!Since I am most familiar with the older games represented in this movie (not that I necessarily played them or was a fan of them), I can't say that I know if there are any new game characters which would be known to a young audience and hence give them a reason to take a particular interest in this movie.There is some product placement in the movie...I mean, apart from the obvious use of characters who feature in these old arcarde or video games.As an adult, this movie appealed to me, hence the good score.",8,1,1,14 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Saturday arvo matinée fare...62.5+%
","It takes a little while, but eventually this movie does make the prospect of seeing more in the series interesting. Roughly 30 odd minutes. That first half hour is a real chore to watch and you wonder if you have the stomach for another two and a bit hours of it. In it you have Bilbo Baggins (as an old Hobbit...still played by Martin Freeman?) narrate some events which he was not a witness to in order to introduce us to the adventures he had as a young Hobbit as a result. I was actually wondering if the entire movie would be like a bedtime story! All this alternates in that first half hour with scenes of the old Bilbo at his home with his son Frodo (just Googled him...'adoptive heir' is the phrase used to describe him), preparing for some 'party'. It's all just so incredibly dull...perfunctory dialogue and action which just makes you question why it so lovingly depicted. In fact, the dialogue is just uninspired...low level writing...not showing but saying.Things don't improve that much when Bilbo is imposed upon by a small band of dwarfs, including their prince, Thorin (played by Richard Armitage). Thorin plans to reclaim his ancestral home from a covetous dragon. The dwarfs intend Bilbo to help them do this...something which Bilbo is understandably reluctant to agree to. The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) is set on having Bilbo join the adventure in any case. It's as tiresome and annoying to watch this deluge of dwarfs in Bilbo's house as it is for Bilbo, who likes his house to be neat. And when the dwarfs sing...hmm...entertainment ain't what it used to be!Anyway, the movie is almost ready to redeem itself...but not before having some perfunctory action scenes. Not sure whether the flaws of the movie are the flaws of the book (not having read either of Tolkien's famous novels but enjoying the previous 'Rings' trilogy...especially the second, which knows how to stage engrossing action scenes), but the film does not come across as great art. It's more like adequate Saturday afternoon matinée fare...and on that level it delivers...albeit in just under three hours! Whilst the early part of the movie comes across as a children's fairytale, the latter part of the movie is pitched more at adults...there is some violence which I think would not be suitable to a very young audience, perhaps.At some point the movie rises above these humble beginnings and makes you want to follow the story down the road. After the great work of the 'Rings' trilogy by the same maker (Peter Jackson), The Hobbit seems like a precursor work where those involved find it hard to reach the right tone. Richard Armitage's Thorin at times seems nothing but poses. Cate Blanchett's character of Galadriel doesn't seem to capture the ethereal tone she set much better in the 'Rings' trilogy. And the quizzical elvin poses seem style over substance often times too...suggesting dogs...or Spock. All this just adds to the sense of a story full of action which signifies nothing.Sad to say, these weren't the only times I found proceedings just plain silly. Imagine my surprise when told that dragons 'covet gold'! M'kay. When the stone giants fight, that just seems pure popcorn from a Saturday arvo matinée with no pretensions of greatness. With such silliness going on, the at times solemnity and earnestness is an odd fit for this kind of story.Since this trilogy will be a prequel to the 'Lord of the rings' trilogy, I now wish that I had remembered more of the story of the ring in that previous trilogy. It's also a pity that some of Gollum's intriguing riddles are difficult to understand and so are missed because the movie wants Gollum to be quite 'Other'. Hopefully the DVD will have subtitles!It was interesting to read the disclaimer at the end of the movie about no animals being harmed in the making of this movie. I think that that is what was stated. That might be false advertising as this movie has been in the news prior to its release for the number of animals that died during the making of it...goats and horses, I believe.Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, hopefully things will improve from here on in. Currently it seems like a glorified 'B' movie, with hammy acting and some nothing dialogue. But it would take a pretty bad sequel for me to give up on the trilogy.It must be noted though that the cinematography and special effects are a treat...an award for the latter would be deserved, if not the former...but I do like 'Life of Pi' for that honour.",6,4,8,23 January 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," Only for those who are heavily invested in this franchise...they'll be more easily pleased. 40%
","Firstly, let me just admit that I haven't been devotedly watching every film in this series with a tie-in to this latest Avengers' outing. Looking at my reviews at this site, the last one directly related to this one that I saw was this film's immediate predecessor, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. From the moment this latest film begins, with superheroes dead or dying on what looks like the aftermath of some epic battle, it gives the impression of having immediately followed on from some previous Marvel film...which I haven't seen...which may or may not be the case. I.e. perhaps there was a film which showed the epic battle of which the opening scene is the aftermath? If so, then, obviously, it might pay to watch every single tie-in film to this one to be in the loop*, so to speak.  Secondly, apart from possibly not being a true stand-alone film, the ending also makes clear that there will have to be another Marvel film which will directly follow-on from the ending of this one. There are some obvious story elements in this latest Marvel film which makes clear that I have missed certain developments from previous Marvel films that I have missed (i.e. chosen to ignore...it looks like the only other Marvel film that I saw before Infnitity War was 'Deadpool' and I do plan on watching the sequel to that sometime soon). Characters from other franchises also appear...e.g. the Guardians of the galaxy...another Marvel franchise that I have not seen (and the level of comedy that those characters reveal in this film doesn't make me feel like I've missed out on anything by not seeing that other franchise). Other characters, well...I have no idea who these people are... All that being said, I have to say that none of this is an excuse as to how low the bar has been set for this film, as far as the writing, characterisation and entertainment factor goes. This tends to be a problem with most films in this universe...eventually I just get bored of seeing the sequels...which happened after the first Thor film for me and maybe the third Iron Man film, if I made it that far...or the Spider-Man reboots...perhaps even the latter film(s) of the Tobey Maguire incarnation of the character. Anyway, the plot of Infinity War concerns a supervillain called 'Thanos', who seeks to gain great power by collecting 'Infinity Stones' (most of the names of these stones sound pretty unimpressive...I feel that marketing could have really put more work into coming up with cool sounding stones), which give him various mystical abilities which he uses for warlike purposes. He's already made a start on the collection of Infinity Stones (gotta catch 'em all!). Seeing Thanos in action against superheroes, he really does make them seem like boys fighting against men...who are warriors. An interesting aspect to Thanos' character is his psychology...he wants to collect all the Infinity Stones so that he can bring about much faster his plan to randomly kill fifty per cent of all life in the universe. He espouses reasons such as societies eventually collapsing and dying because there are too many people and not enough resources to sustain them. On that level, he does come across as rational...but is he? In other words, is he just so crazy he has to be stopped? Why fight it? Of course, such plans are anathema to superheroes and they try their best to stop Thanos. So, the reason that I score this film poorly...it just doesn't try very hard to be entertaining, apart from in the action department. It relies on fans being so obsessed with the characters in this universe that they will lap up every attempted joke the writers have to offer. And the writers lack the wit of a Joss Whedon. For instance, one scene has Thor made to look an idiot (the bit where he tries to harness the power of a star) and another character (Hagrid?) labouring that obvious point as a result. Generally, most of the jokes fail. The odd joke works, but they aren't particularly high calibre. If you absolutely LOVE this universe, the writers are relying on you to be so invested and so well predisposed to these characters that they will have to do very little quality work for you to lap it up. In my review here of 'Age of Ultron', I think I pondered whether I would continue seeing more films in this series. Based on this film, I think that it might be unlikely. Contrast that criticism with films that are based on stories unknown to the public and/or with a cast of unknown leads...they can sometimes create a great emotional investment in the characters and story or amuse you with their wit and comedy. With Infinity War, it's all shorthand...the invested viewer has to fill in the gaps which the scriptwriters don't provide themselves, as far as characterisation and humour goes. Some reviews that I've come across mention that favourite superheroes die in this film. Seeing what Thanos does immediately preceding such events makes me wonder how permanent such an outcome is. * Having to watch EVERY film with a tie-in to Avengers' films just seems like too high a price to pay. It's not worth it, just for the latest Avengers film to make sense. Being entertained is more important to me, and eventually the sequels bore or the spin-offs underwhelm.Random observations:* I saw this film in 2D. It's my strong suspicion that forking out more to watch it in 3D would be a waste of money...nothing really struck me as being particularly geared towards a 3D experience and often Hollywood makes rather pointless 3D movies anyway...just a vacuous way to extract more money from the cinemagoer.* The closing credits mentions 'Arrested Development character'...I wonder what that refers to.* Near the start of the closing credits the name 'Okabayashi' appears...not sure if I noted that accurately...but I did wonder if it was related to a a word I came across which related to the Star Trek universe: 'Kobayashi' (I had to search a list of Star Trek video games to remind myself of that name!).* Like a James Bond film, the closing credits have the phrase 'Thanos will return'!* What's that black thing in Captain America's ear? Which film did I miss to see the explanation of that?",4,2,3,3 June 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A truthy Tarantino film, with a little bit of fact and a lot of friction. 75+%
","It might be an idea not to see this film with a knowledge about its subject matter because even though I avoided reading reviews about it, I did manage to pick up that it did deal with historical people and events. That affected how I related to this film. What might otherwise have seemed a meandering story about two people in the TV industry in Hollywood turned into a countdown (dates regularly are displayed on the screen) to when that known history would intersect with the (presumably) fictional characters who are the subject of the story (hence my slightly low score for it). It helped that my knowledge of these notorious historical figures and events was vague enough so as not to know when that coming together of fiction and history would happen. Perhaps most people would be in my position: the names of the historical figures ring a bell but the details of the events are forgotten or not even known.With all that being said, the film centres on Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a fragile TV star and his stunt double, Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt), who is practically 'babysitting' him. Now, it struck me as being implausible that a TV star and their stunt double would socialise so much, let alone at all. However, this implausibility is addressed by the film and you just go with it and not overthink things. At times it seems that DiCaprio's acting is wooden, but that would just be more or less due to the character that he plays. His fragile ego is his shield, his sword. Or so I've heard. In some scenes Cliff Booth looks like the Marlboro Man, in others like Robert Redford. If you don't know about the historical references from the intersecting storyline, you would just take this film to be about the career ups and downs of Dalton and how that effects him. Speaking of historical references, there would be great nostalgia value for people who grew up watching film or TV especially, in the 1950s and 1960s, as you get many visual and audio grabs of popular US entertainment from that period as well as the popular music of this era.At this point I haven't looked to see if Dalton is a real person (perhaps with a changed name) or a truthy version/amalgam of some real actor or actors. His roles in TV and film suggest to me that he might be based in part on some real Hollywood figure...someone who starred in Westerns...and then played such roles overseas, for a while. So, I was wondering if that real person might have actually lived where 'Dalton' lived...or somewhere nearby.That question becomes more pronounced when Booth meets some people who I wondered if they were part of that intersecting story arc. In other words, I wondered if there really was a Cliff Booth type character involved in the historical event in question and whether he may have, in some sense, prompted that moment in history.One character (an actress), mentions the kinds of films which she has been in, which seemed a salacious detail to have in the film. The Wikipedia article on her is too lengthy for me to quickly confirm that detail but so far I don't see anything to confirm it. If the detail is false, it does make you wonder about how writer, director and producer Quentin Tarantino is mixing fact and fiction in this film. Anyway, looking a bit further in the article, I can see, perhaps, a candidate for what film she was talking about. I'd just need to check her film chronology (assuming this film is accurate or that a filmography would include such a film) in order to confirm that.For some people, I suppose, the heart of the matter is whether Tarantino is respecting the history of these real people and events. Maybe I shouldn't presume that Tarantino has done much research into the historical events that he portrays? For example, in one moment in the film, right towards the end, there is a scene which made me wonder whether Charlie was, in fact, responsible for the historical events. No, don't lookup 'Charlie' if my reference has baffled you! In any case, that was an inference I made based on what a male character says to some women in a car with him. Does the real historical event allow for such an interpretation, as gleaned from this film by me?In a more trivial vein, there were a couple of times where I wondered if Cliff Booth was imagining something. In the first instance, there is his encounter with a man who would become a major Asian star. It's not clear to me whether the event depicted actually happened (i.e. in the film) or whether he was imagining it. There is another scene, towards, the end, where I wondered the same thing and this relates to my previous point about whether Tarantino is respecting the history. That latter scene brought into stark relief how these two intersecting story arcs would play out. Which narrative would envelope the other and which would be enveloped? Even though I can say that I was maybe expecting the unexpected in this film's ending, well, I wasn't really expecting that ending! Maybe I just haven't seen enough Tarantino films or something! In some ways, this film reminds me of another Tarantino film...they have some things in common. In any case, I was okay with the ending. I'm not sure how anyone personally affected by the historical events of that time would feel about the ending though but it was a long time ago, in any case.Miscellaneous notes:* At least two Australians are in the cast, perhaps three, if you don't assume a good impression of our accent (wise! Based on a real person?)* A stunning depiction of Cliff Booth's personal circumstances.* I liked Rick Dalton's scene with a very young actress who took her craft more seriously than he did! She would also hate me referring to her as an 'actress'! I didn't catch the name on her chair: based on a real person?Recommendations:* Tarantino is one of the interviewees in the documentary: 'Not quite Hollywood: The wild, untold story of Ozploitation!'* Summerfield. An Australian film that I've reviewed here. It has a similar vibe.",8,6,9,5 September 2019
Django Unchained," Entertaining and witty movie...85%
","Like director Quentin Tarantino's earlier movie, 'Inglourious basterds', this one is about the return of the repressed. In the earlier movie, that was the Jew, with the added twist that this time he was taking the fight up to Hitler! This time, it's the negro slave just before the American civil war which outlawed slavery. Not sure if Tarantino has mined all the wronged ethnic groups...Jews and black Africans...that's it, surely? Stay tuned. In any case, like 'Inglourious basterds' this is a highly entertaining day dream of the 'What if...?' variety. A revenge fantasy in other words.The story involves a secret bounty hunter (Dr. King Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz) who poses as a travelling dentist, in order to find his latest targets, three brothers wanted for murder and robbery. He needs somebody who can identify the brothers for him, so needs a slave to buy who knows them by site. That turns out to be Django (played by Jamie Foxx). Schultz is a German and has an 'innocent abroad' way to him, as far as America's slave system goes. He marvels at people's reactions to what Django does when he is with him. It is curious to me why Tarantino chose a German to be in this role. Having recently watched the interesting documentary series 'Civilisation: Is the West history?', I know that Adolf Hitler's views on race were shaped by a German 'scientist' in colonial Africa...in the late 19th century. This link came to me in a scene involving a skull in this movie...there is a very horrific story in the documentary series concerning this German 'scientist' and an African woman, also concerning the creation of a skull.Anyway, despite Schultz being no advocate of slavery, he realises he needs this cover for his bounty hunting activities (his main cover is that of being a dentist)...Django will play the role of his servant. For this reason, Schultz helps turn Django into an effective bounty hunter...a skill that will become useful to him as Django seeks to reunite with his wife, Broomhilda von Schaft (! played by Kerry Washington), who is a slave on a notorious plantation.In Hollywood movies or TV series of decades ago, you would often see African Americans in roles...as slaves or as house servants in modern set stories. For the latter, particularly, it's not clear to me exactly what the meaning of this is...that African Americans have 'improved' their lot in America? That they are now treated better by white Americans? There is no such mystery in 'Django unchained'. Django is the unconventional hero with a quest...where he gets to kill white people. Unthinkable decades ago in US pop culture...that would ordinarily make the character a villain.Things I liked in this movie: * A collage of visual styles, taking their cues from genre movies or movies from other countries.* The visual aesthetic of place...e.g. the boggy Main St. in some tiny town...it really made the place look like a dung hill...which is unusual for Westerns.* Leonardo DiCaprio's gaze of searching intensity on Django (DiCaprio plays Calvin Candie, a notorious slave owner who Django must deal with in order to get his wife returned to him safely).* An interesting question asked by Candie to his dinner guests, where he uses a human skull as a prop. Be interesting to know if the answer he proffers was the 'intellectual' explanation of the day. It's this scene which brought to mind the scene in the documentary series 'Civilisation' and the question of why Tarantino had a German play the role of the bounty hunter. Irony? * I especially liked the scene where Big Daddy (who I didn't realise was played by Don Johnson...hey, I never watched 'Miami vice'!) discusses with one of his female slaves how she should treat Django...it's witty and shows real human character and psychology at play. Good screen writing that.* There is also humour in Django's early fashion sense, once he becomes part of Schultz' quest to claim the bounty on three brothers.* Speaking of actors I did not recognise...I had heard that Samuel L. (for 'Ladies love...'?) Jackson was good in a disturbing role in this movie. I was enjoying the humour of a certain character in this movie and then...it dawned on me that that was Mr. Jackson hisself! Most amusing was his character's paraphrasing of William Shakespeare's Richard III (who, by the by, has recently been discovered under car park in England!). Other points of interest: * I was browsing a newsagent magazine rack and noticed a feature on this movie...there was a particularly horrific picture from the movie...it might have been on the cover of this magazine, which was a horror magazine. Glad to say that this scene is not in the movie...even though the movie is bloody and violent, this particular shot (which I assume to be in the slave fight scene in Candie's mansion) was just too gruesome, in an over the top manner. Which begs the question: has the Australian release of this movie been censored? If not, is that scene to be included in some 'director's cut' of the film for DVD? * Quentin Tarantino plays an Australian in this movie...for some reason. Australian John Jarratt also is in scenes with him, playing an Australian. This just seems really random. Jarratt piles his 'Australianness' on thick and Tarantino's accent is good in parts. Well, good in part, singular. Still, Robin Williams could no doubt learn something about Australian accents from Tarantino. Which isn't really saying much! All this stuff is anachronistic, but fits in with some of the caricatures of Americana found in this movie.* Story wise, I did find it odd how Schultz' and Candie's final interaction with each other played out, considering what was at stake...beforehand, it was Schultz always advocating Django to be judicious.",8,2,5,6 February 2013
2012," 10/10 purely for the special effects. Makes the genre redundant
","If you would like to know what front row seats to The Apocalypse would look like, look no further. Suspend disbelief and count the number of times the central family in this tale nearly get killed in a spectacular way by the unfolding disasters. Yes, disasters. Plural. Want tidal waves? Gottem. Want exploding volcanoes? Check. Want earthquakes? Man, you are really sick! Tick. Instead of looking at every kind of disaster movie ever made, do yourself a favour and just watch this one. You'll save yourself a lot of time and money.Save your breath if you want to argue that the scenario presented in this movie is somewhat implausible. I'm sure it would be more plausible to have some of the events depicted in this take place over several decades or centuries. You gotta think things through better...you'd then need the central family (do you really want a name for them?) to have an extended lifetime due to medical or scientific advances and...who could be bothered? Just enjoy this for what it is...a great popcorn movie.Just by the by, I've heard how the more 'charismatic' Christian cults in America often had leaders who declared the end of the world. Get that prediction wrong once, then shame on you. Get it wrong twice, and as Dubya might say 'More shame on you'. Eventually these 'charismatic' leaders just gave up showing up for 'work' with egg on their face, so they just stopped making these predictions.Perhaps by the law of averages, ONE OF THESE DAYS SOMEONE is going to get a prediction like this right. This movie is what it will look like when they do...if adherence to strict scientific theory isn't a major sticking point for you.An entertaining movie with terrific special effects, which doesn't get bogged down in the 'boring' stuff...like lots of backstory...when what you want is The End Of The World.Enjoy.P.S. the end credits make mention of this movie being inspired by the book 'The hand of God'. Tried looking for this, but had no luck...would appreciate any pointers to finding it...just having looked in Amazon now, there are a few titles by this name. Not sure which it is though. Help appreciated.",8,1,9,13 December 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," My pick as the superior episode of this trilogy
","Of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, adapted from the famous book(s) by J.R.R. Tolkien (which I haven't read), this second installment is my favourite. It should have been the one to sweep the Academy Awards, as the last chapter in the trilogy did. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I get the feeling that the Academy jumped on the juggernaut/band-wagon for the final episode.The main reason I liked this movie so much was for the engrossing war scenes. It's one of the few films where there are countless thousands of soldiers fighting yet is nevertheless fascinating. Notable failures in this respect include one of the early Star Wars prequels (hey, apart from the third installment of that prequel trilogy, they're all pretty forgettable). In that movie, countless thousands of computer generated soldiers fighting each other was just mind-numbingly boring. As was the giant brawl between hundreds of apes in one of the sequels to the 'Planet of the Apes' series.In 'Two Towers' you get one things those failures didn't have...military strategy. Tension is built up by seeing military tactics and equipment deployed. It's just not one humongous but mindless fight scene. The best example of that is when one of the castles is besieged and attacked.In any case, this if a fine trilogy. Watch it from start to finish. It's just the second chapter that I'd give 5 stars too, though.",10,0,2,4 July 2008
I Am Legend," A good evocation of a catastrophe and derelict major city
","Having posted up some reviews of 'old school' zombie movies here (by George A. Romero), I thought I'd post up one for this Hollywood blockbuster variation (Romero was not mainstream and worked on shoe-string budgets).Will Smith, playing military scientist Robert Neville, finds himself in a world which has imploded after a medical virus which seemed to cure cancer goes feral, creating 'zombie' humans and seems to leave him as the sole, unaffected survivor-at least in New York, but perhaps the world too.Smith manages to hold our attention despite being the sole human character for much of the movie (there are flashbacks where his character is seen with his wife etc). One of the strengths of the movie is the relationship Smith shares with his pet dog-sort of like the relationship Max has with his mutt in Mad Max 2 (I posted up a review of that here earlier today).Perhaps the best reason to see this movie is for it's depiction of a derelict New York. These are the most effective evocations of a world gone wrong.One gripe about this movie is the representation of the 'zombies' in this movie. In the latter scenes, these affected humans cease to be plausible representations of victims of a mutant virus (um, I don't want to get into a debate about 'realistic' depictions of zombies though!).In fact, one of the most effective scenes is when we see these things up close for the first time. It's really unnerving and scary. That was a bit of an opportunity lost, I thought, in not going down that road. In trying to be novel about the zombies, it goes in a less satisfying direction than it could have. Even with a budget, Romero didn't overdo the zombies in his movie.Given the subject nature of this movie and the fact that it is an American movie, it's not really surprising that you get religious references in this movie-from posters, to theological discussions. Not a huge downer, but it does get tiresome having many American movies behaving like God botherers.Watch this movie for its evocation of a derelict New York. It looks REALLY cool.",7,0,1,3 July 2008
Kick-Ass," Delivers on the promise of its title and revitalises a tired genre
","The premise of the movie isn't actually exciting for an adult...a movie about child superheroes? Sounds REALLY lame. However, watching a movie review TV show here in Australia it was mentioned that this movie is very violent and the male reviewer expressed concern about the scenes with the young girl superhero. Righto...this could be interesting!Kick Ass is a pastiche of movie genres...it has an indie cinema vibe to it early on (think 'Juno'), a teen sex comedy element (think of any number of American movies where teenage boys try to 'get laid'), adult comic vibe (superhero movies with 'dark' themes and scenes, like the all time classic 'Watchmen') etc. And it all works very well together. You'll see scenes and be able to cross out stylistic 'borrowings'...be it 'The Matrix' or the experience of playing a first person shooter video game (like 'Doom', say).Anyway, the movie starts off like it is going to explore what would really happen if anyone tried to become a superhero. The reality is very violent, so it's not a movie I'd recommend for pre-teens. Sure, it has elements that would appeal to them, but the contrast between childish notions of superhero-dom and the 'reality' is very marked and unsuited to younger children...there's some confronting violence in this movie...by characters such as Hit-Girl and towards her character, for instance.Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass and is appropriately geeky as a wannabe superhero/lady's man. The movie contrasts a geek-boy fantasy of being a superhero with 'real' superheroes. In this way the movie is reasonably novel...the crowd after a 'pure' superhero movie may not be so much into these parts of the story.As for the real superheroes in this movie, Chloe Moretz (as 'Hit-Girl'...looking like a very young Dame Edna Everage!) is the REAL Kick Ass superhero. Recently superhero movies have been disappointing me...especially sequels (Transformers 2 is a big let-down). Moretz transforms and revitalises the genre with a vivacious performance. She has a really bright aura around her...whereas Batman was a dull character in The Dark Knight, overshadowed by Ledger's brilliant turn as 'The Joker', Hit-Girl makes for an exciting heroine. And all round, this movie is superior to The Dark Knight...take Ledger out of that movie and it suffers for the loss. The incongruity of Hit-Girl (a pre-pubescent girl) in the superhero genre has really killed my fatigue with the genre. Getting a bit paternal, it would be great to see Moretz become a poster girl for climate change scientists or quantum mechanics...but hey, a career playing Hit-Girl would impress people more, I suspect.It should be noted though, that Hit-Girl uses very strong language, which is another reason this movie is unsuitable for very young children...perhaps. You could say that either Hit-Girl swears like a policeman or that she brings the language of the playground into movies. Of course, there was the similarly young Regan in 'The exorcist', but her language was attributed to demonic possession...Hit-Girl can't blame supernatual entitities for her potty-mouth though...which is why it's embedded in realism.Speaking of Batman, Nicolas Cage channels Michael Keaton's Batman at times, in his role as superhero 'Big Daddy'.Was thinking of giving this movie 10/10. I'm sure that this movie will have great repeat viewing potential, but I'm just marking it down one point for the bits of pastiche that aren't as exciting as the comic book showdowns...I mean all that geeky stuff.In a way, the prospect of a sequel for this movie is very exciting...be great to see more of Hit-Girl. However, this is such a great fun movie you wonder if creating a sequel would sully its legacy...I doubt if I will see Transformers 3...the first sequel sucked so badly.",9,4,14,30 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," Good 'fly on the wall' type treatment of bomb disposal in Iraq...
","Many years ago I remember being a fan of the English TV series 'Danger: UXB'. It was about a unit in World War II who dismantled bombs dropped in raids by German planes on English soil.The Hurt Locker has a similar premise, except this time the unit is in enemy territory. It depicts a close unit who have to deal with a new bomb disposal expert...the new guy is taken to be a maverick.Found this to be a good movie, but I'm not as big a convert to it as many critics, who give it full marks.Generally the action seems quite realistic, but one sequence seemed improbable to me...when the maverick (Sergeant First Class William James, played by Jeremy Renner) takes his unit on a mission which wasn't part of their duties). Not sure if stuff like that really happens.Otherwise a tense drama about the possibility of death at any moment. Unlike 'Green zone', which was released around the same time as this movie in Australia, 'The hurt locker' does not delve into the motivation for America's invasion of Iraq. Both movies have the same setting (Iraq) and are of the same time-frame. Green Zone is also a good movie...it's just more political.",8,2,7,30 April 2010
Transformers," Good popcorn movie
","This is an entertaining action movie concerning the invasion of Earth by living robots that can mimic Earth technology, like cars and planes etc. Parents should be warned though-the movie is based on a cartoon show which was based on toys...which means small kiddies will want to collect the ENTIRE 'Transformers' collection of toys, cartoons, etc. So, this movie is potentially dangerous to your wallet and mortgage.Firstly, seeing as the genesis of this movie is so rooted in children's' toys and cartoons, the movie is quite adult in parts-with matters concerning sex and masturbation...so, it's quite odd to see this kind of material in a movie which is presumably not suitable for its child consumer audience.Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie quite funny in parts, especially as I groaned at some of the early 'humour' of one of the 'Transformers' (a car, in this case) playing certain songs on the radio which shadowed the car's driver's expectations (in getting laid).The movie features the Italian Dustin Hoffman, John Turturro, as well as John Voight, who both bring the occasional B movie melodrama acting in a self-conscious way...to good effect.The movie is pretty much non-stop action, but yet not in a bad way, as some action scenes/movies can be (like the mass fighting scenes in one of the Planet Of The Apes movies as well as Attack Of The Clones, the second Star Wars prequel). The special effects are excellent in this movie...from the transformation of cars etc. into humanoid looking fighting robots, as well as the scenes of destruction brought about by the Transformers in urban environments.I doubt that this movie is something that can be enjoyed so much on a second viewing, but you cannot fault its entertainment value on first viewing.Its saving grace for older audiences is (apart from the action scenes), is, as I say, the humour. From teenagers, to parents (especially the Transformers themselves), each brings some comedy to the proceedings.However, some of the 'philosophy' in the movie is painful to listen to-the 'Transformers' spout some non-sense, which is presumably to guide how children play with their toys or something. It's a very ODD combination of adult material and material for children. The movie can't seem to make up its mind on what its target audience is.",6,1,2,20 March 2008
Lincoln," Yes, President... 77.5%
","Found this movie rather dry yet often witty. This true story concerns the closing days of the American Civil War, where President Abraham Lincoln was keen to abolish slavery and make it no longer possible to ever practice it again via an amendment to the American constitution (the Thirteenth Amendment). It is a wordy movie, often seeming stagey or as if written by a playwright...although sometimes it does go for farce. Initially I was going to say that this movie reminded me of 'Yes, (Prime) Minister)' but that it was more lowbrow...but then I remembered that whilst the satirical British sitcom was often wordy and witty, it too went for populist laughs.Not being American, I can't say that I've had a lot of exposure to representations of Lincoln, but it would be easy to believe that Daniel Day-Lewis brings great verisimilitude to his performance. Lincoln here, as represented as Day-Lewis is a fully realised human. Sometimes he looks like what I remember Lincoln to look like, in pictures...as in you see him, and think, 'Yes, that's Abraham Lincoln'. Day-Lewis' Lincoln has the look/sound of an Amish-apothecary-Anglican minister about him. He has the amusing trait of always willing to tell a story...which would sometimes befuddle his audience or drive them elsewhere (as in that scene with a general, I think). Lincoln here is an obscure chatterbox, making points that some may not understand or just bore some. Perhaps a bit like Sir Humphrey Appleby in 'Yes, (Prime) Minister'?Seeing Lincoln in this light, you also sometimes wonder what on Earth he is talking about and how it relates to what someone has just asked him, but, lo, it does relate. Then there are the farcical stories he tells...I enjoyed his anecdote concerning an American politician, I believe, who was in an estate of the landed gentry in England...their toilet had an unlikely artwork in there. The punchline is most amusing (presumably the story is true...or at least makes for a great story!).There are other farcical elements to this movie. Much of the movie is taken with the project of getting the numbers to pass the Thirteenth Amendment. Strategies which would now no doubt be seen as corrupt are presented here as farce here, at times.Day-Lewis' Lincoln is an heroic figure here. He verbalises his internal struggle with the great conundrums he must face...often involving choosing the lesser of two evils. Perhaps the movie portrays Lincoln through rose-coloured glasses? I did read an article before watching this movie ('Lincoln sheds little light on some of history's dark deeds' by Chris Berg, in The Age newspaper...07/02/2013?). The author is with the I.P.A. organisation, a right-wing think tank here in Australia. Actually, it seems that they are secretly funded by big tobacco and - surprise, surprise - they advocate for them. Anyway, from memory, the article mentions that many innocent Americans were tortured or murdered by Lincoln's orders. You don't see stuff like that in this movie, if it is true.Despite this, the 'lesser of two evils' that Lincoln chooses seems justified...unlike, say, the justifications President George W. Bush gave for his policies after invading Iraq. In that case civil liberties were were trampled underfoot after a country which had nothing to do with the attacks on the Twin Towers was invaded by the U.S. The president knew that his business partners in Saudi Arabia were implicated in the attacks on the Twin Towers. So, for me, what I see Lincoln do in order to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed seem justified on the basis of it being 'for the greater good'.Sally Field as Abraham's wife Mary shines in some scenes and she would be a worthy winner of any best actress award, along with Naomi Watts in 'The impossible' or Helen Hunt in 'The sessions'.Tommy Lee Jones as the Republican Thaddeus Stevens is interesting as a character. There is a nice pay off with his character in his final scene where he arrives home. Didn't see that coming! An unkind person might say that Tommy Lee Jones is playing Tony Mokbel. Not sure what that is all about (pop cultural reference...excuse me!).Another surprise was the suggestion in the movie that the theorems of the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid influenced the Thirteenth Amendment! When watching the parliamentary (?) debates in the movie, it did have a very English feel to them. A modern viewer would no doubt be most amused by the 'slippery slope' argument against abolishing slavery...no doubt stuff like that was said, but it does give the movie a very lowbrow feel as far as the humour goes.When watching the movie, I was thinking what to score it...75+% was my first move. Ended up giving it 77.5%. Maybe this movie has some repeat viewing value and a score of 85% wouldn't be out of the question in any case. Daniel Day-Lewis would be a worthy winner of any best actor award. The script might deserve an award too. The dryness of the movie makes my scoring less than extravagant though. Like I say, it is a very wordy movie. Lincoln's tug of war between principle and effective governance is compelling viewing though (the whole theme of how Lincoln defines his presidential powers).* Random observations...The credits mention Kevin Kline in one scene...didn't notice!Sometimes the artifice of the movie intrudes being lost in the moment...from the score sometimes trying to manipulate your emotions to that scene with Sally Field where a jarring change of camera angle detracted from the moment.Right near the end of the movie, I suddenly remembered what ultimately happened to Lincoln...the movie did not delve much in to that.",8,0,1,19 February 2013
Mulholland Drive," An interpretation of the film's 'meaning'
","Here's my take on that film. In a nutshell, the film's theme is 'Hollywood dream turns into a nightmare'. The rest is just embroidery.I'm not much of a linguist, but I like the concepts of 'semantics' and 'syntax'. One is to do with meaning, the other to do with structure. MH seems to be heavy on syntax, in the sense that there are some syntactic games being played-characters being played by different actors along the lines of, to relate this back to syntax:'The DOG chased the CAT' 'The CAT chased the HOUSE'I.e. there is a syntactic structure that is being played around with. When you do that, meaning may lag or be absent from the sentence. Just because a sentence is syntactically valid, does not make is meaningful, or perhaps an interpretation has to be arrived at, one that makes that syntactic expression meaningful. E.g. has one been arrived at for the final trip scene in 2001: A space odyssey?So, what does it MEAN when actor x becomes character y then z in the film? Maybe it's just a game...or maybe that is where deeper meaning comes into the film.Also, at the start of the film, I thought that the acting was really bad, but it improved. I can give a charitable explanation for this-apart from the acting starting out bad...the film is sort of like a parody on the wannabe actor phenomenon...people going to Hollywood with stars in their eyes-being undeveloped people/characters. These wannabes are interchangeable-hence, perhaps, why the actors/characters in the movie are interchangeable-i.e. these people are a dime a dozen. Once the grim reality of trying to make it in Hollywood dawns on these people, they become more real as people-they no longer have stars in their eyes...much like the female leads in this film.As for those people in the lunch-box...your guess is as good as mine!Confusing movie, sure, but boiled down, it is, like a say, a fable about the Hollywood dream turning into a nightmare.",Null,0,1,7 October 2004
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A morality tale on the Nazi era
","For most of this movie, you get the impression that it might have been based on a true story. It concerns a German family during the Nazi era. The father is an officer with the SS, I think, and has to relocate his family to run a 'work camp' for people, including Jews, when he receives a promotion.The father (played by David Thewlis) has a young family...a young boy and a slightly older daughter (she is 12 years old in the story, the boy is 8 years old). The story is told from the perspective of the boy, Bruno, played by Asa Butterfield.The period detail of the era seems very good, and the central family is human...just because the father is an important Nazi does not mean he is caricatured as an evil villain. Some of the Nazi propaganda/paraphernalia which the daughter becomes taken with seems genuine.From the perspective of Bruno, the 'work camp' is a farm where the farmers wear strange attire (striped pyjamas). Exploring that farm's boundaries, he meets a young boy about his age, called 'Shmuel', played by Jack Scanlon. Shmuel looks like an urchin from a Charles Dickens novel...grubby faced, and with rotten teeth. Bruno and Schmuel form an unlikely friendship, one which is unknown to his parents and sister.Despite the grim setting of this movie, Bruno's naivete is charming and provides much of the humour which this movie possesses. However, despite being very naive, Bruno is faced with some serious moral dilemmas, and these provide some of the most dramatic moments of the movie.Any thoughts I had of finding out if the movie was based on a kernel of truth went out the window towards the end of the movie. It's here that the movie obviously goes into 'morality tale' mode. The movie is intended to be manipulative here, which isn't a bad thing. It's just that I felt that manipulation was not successful, as it needed to be, given the turn of events. In fact, the strange turn the movie took distracted me from the intended manipulation...I was formulating hypotheses on where the movie was given...even wondering if there was another, hidden level to Shmuel. My working hypothesis went out the window, as the turn was in keeping with the preceding events.Despite being an art-house movie, this movie has been in Australia's top 10 movies at the box-office, I think, for a few weeks, meaning that it has found a mainstream audience.Overall, Bruno and Shmuel are captivating characters...ones you will be glad to have known. For me, it's a pity that the movie lacked more of an emotional punch...but others may feel it succeeded splendidly on that level. Perhaps the denouement was a little too sudden for me.",7,1,2,23 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Improves slightly over the previous film & takes some narrative risks. A little crazy too. 70%
","Following on from the previous movie in this final (?) trilogy, whose name escapes me right now (looking it up on Wikipedia now...ah, yes, 'Star Wars: Episode VII'...just kidding...'Star Wars: The force awakens'...actually, it just came to me now...I didn't even need to look it up!), we get to find out what happens when our young heroine, Rey (I had to check the spelling of her name on Wikipedia) meets Luke Skywalker, who may prove to be the Resistance's final hope (I had to Wikipedia what they were called...I initially typed 'the Alliance') in staving of the wannabe New Empire (The First Order?). Things get complicated between them. The good news is that the film doesn't suck. The bad news is that it doesn't reach any great heights, although it does have more going for it than most of the other films in the series (especially episodes I and II, and, to a lesser extent, episode VII. Of course, there will be battles with the New Empire or whatever they're called. Anyway, I suppose I'll be happy enough to see this trilogy through to the end, as it is improving slightly on each outing. 'The last Jedi' was tracking to score about 65% for me, but a little bit of daring on its part as far as what happens to characters goes pushes my score out to a flat 70%. In other words, I liked how the film created certain character expectations and then subverted them. Okay, to general observations about this film. I mentioned earlier that it doesn't reach any great heights. Why not? Well, part of the problem as you might have observed from my opening paragraph is how forgettable the character's names are, unlike the characters in 'A new hope'...or is that just me? Having seen 'The force awakens' only once, and when it was originally in cinemas too, most of the new characters' names didn't stick with me, apart from Rey and Kylo Ren. I would mentally thank characters for mentioning the name of those familiar looking characters, e.g. the black Resistance fighter from the previous film...er...Finn. 'The last Jedi' has one Resistance character get a lot of screen time and I wondered if that was the bloke who was supposed to be an ace fighter pilot in 'The force awakens'...I'm guessing that it was. I wasn't kidding when I said that I couldn't recall the name of the previous movie, until it came to me...or maybe I unconsciously noticed it on a Wikipedia article about 'The last Jedi'. Maybe it's me, but I just don't find these new characters as iconic as those of the original trilogy. Another criticism for me is that the trilogy doesn't really feel epic, with a grand narrative arc and a large, historical sweep. It might have elements of that, but it feels more like an exercise in ticking boxes. It looks like the next film is going to wrap-up the trilogy but that will seem as though it's been done very quickly...the events of the previous film and this one seemed to have happened all very quickly...it doesn't really feel like an epic war between the forces of good and evil, with an ebb and flow of fortunes. As with 'The force awakens', this next instalment also relies a lot on gestures. It's kind of like a pretender to the kind of movie that it wants to be. Whereas 'A new hope' had those exhilarating moments which excited the audience (and me), 'The last Jedi' has characters whooping it up and almost high-fiving each other, as a proxy for the way that film wants the audience to react. Except that I didn't react that way. Then again, I'm not a small boy, like I was when I saw 'A new hope'. Then again, the largish audience I saw 'The last Jedi' with didn't seem to share the joy of the characters either...if they were, they must have been doing it 'on the inside', as George Smilovici might have put it. Sure, there is action aplenty in this film, right from the start. However, I just didn't find it particularly engaging...there's certainly not the emotional pay-off you get with 'A new hope', especially with Luke Skywalker's flight to the Death Star. Some positives from the film include that it has humour...at least I found some scenes amusing and had one moment make me laugh out loud...unlike the 'humour' of the early Star Wars prequels which I just found cringeworthy, to be honest (Jar Jar Binks, anybody?). On the other hand, it is perhaps sad to see Chewbacca being reduced to comic relief cameo status. Also interesting was the expansion, perhaps, of The Force lore in Rey's time on the planet where she found Luke Skywalker. That definitely had some narrative intrigue as to what would happen next. However, the relationship between Rey and Luke is in stark contrast to the narrative arc which occurred between Luke and Yoda in 'The Empire strikes back'.Random observations: I can't remember if there was much made of any connection between Kylo Ren and Rey in the previous film, but in this film it is a focus which piques one's interest and does get resolved later in the story. Just by the by, I could have sworn that Kylo Ren is often called 'Ben' in this film...I'm not sure if my ears deceived me or I'm missing something which would explain why that happens. Some things in the film surprised me...there's one scene with Princess Leia which I just found silly...maybe you'll recognise what I mean when you the film. Another scene with Luke Skywalker I just found flat-out crazy, but, on reflection, it's not as crazy as it seems...if it wasn't explained the way that it was, I'd wonder what the scriptwriters were taking as far as illegal substances go. An early scene has a villain with an English accent, which gives his words a very theatrical air...quite pantomime dialogue, really. Interestingly, Mark Hamill has credits for two roles in this film! I didn't notice his other role though! For the record, his other credit is for a character called 'Dobbu Scay'. The military strategy and capabilities of the Resistance are 'interesting' to say the least...and the bad guys do love to tell the good guys how they are going to defeat them...at great length...which is probably not the best thing to do...when time is of the essence! There are scenes and some dialogue which harks back to earlier films in this franchise...which might perhaps provide some fan service. The iconic John Williams score at the start of movie seemed to me to be under the influence of valium at times...but maybe I just imagined that? I did wonder if there was a continuity problem at the end of the film...that boy...how did he know of Luke Skywalker? Is the film pointing to a reboot of the series or another trilogy...like an endless Buddhist cycle? Lastly, I do wonder if events in the real world will force changes to the original plans for the final in this trilogy. It would be sad if it were so. I would not be against CGI being used to allow certain characters to fulfill their intended narrative arcs, if this wasn't possible in reality. Anyway, I can't really imagine wanting to rewatch the final trilogy of this series, although I will see how it all ends. Only the original trilogy (episodes IV to VI) had that kind of appeal. There lies the difference.",7,1,11,14 December 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A timeless collage about a criminal bent on revenge. 77.5%
","This is a 'timeless' movie in the sense that director Quentin Tarantino is like a lyrebird, drawing from sources covering different eras in pop culture. The introductory credits reek of 1970s Asian martial arts movies (in fact, the movie seems to represent itself as being the product of such a company) and text on the screen stating that 'Revenge is a dish best served cold' is attributed to an 'Old Klingon proverb'!Soon we see what looks like the final moments of a battered bride, just before she is about to be murdered, for some mysterious reason, by a gang of unknown thugs. Early on in the film we can hear Nancy Sinatra sing 'Bang bang (my baby shot me down)'. Having just searched that song, I see that it was initially a song recorded by Cher and Nancy Sinatra covered it in the same year! Tarantino's pop cultural references here are both apt and illustrative of his eclectic approach and 'borrowing'. Anyway, Uma Thurman's 'The bride' is not one for dying and we soon embark on her backstory and thirst for revenge. I say 'The bride', as her name is not revealed to the viewer in this movie. It's odd hearing her name bleeped out when it is mentioned by characters. My attempt at lip reading made me think that her name was 'Patricia'.Presented in chapters, the movie has The Bride seek all those that would have killed her, in order to return the favour to them...but this time more successfully. As per the title of the movie, 'Bill' is the one that The Bride must ultimately confront.Another way that the movie is a fragmented collage is demonstrated when an Asian sounding man takes on the narrating duties for a short stint. Who on Earth is he? Mixing up the temporal sequence/information like this is one way that Tarantino get the viewer to ask questions like mine (that character sounds like he says 'Engrish' at one point in time and 'English' just a few seconds later). The order of the movie's chapters isn't even chronological...when The Bride has visited the first thug the viewer sees, we later see her cross that name off her list...but another name has already been crossed off her list...and we did not see that confrontation with The Bride. Also intriguingly, one hears The Bride using the phrase 'does one'...a peculiarly English (toffee) figure of of speech. The Bride also flits between referencing Shakespeare and Star Trek...from eyebrow culture (as Kath & Kim would say) to lowbrow culture.Patently playful, Tarantino indulges in a backstory for one of the thugs that The Bride is pursuing. That backstory makes use of the cartoon form to inform the viewer, instead of live action flashback. Other times The Bride seems to have access to her would-be killers' personal histories which she should not have (perhaps). It seems to me that Tarantino also has The Bride walk past an actual poster of Uma Thurman at a Tokyo airport! I'm assuming that Uma actually did paid work for that poster before the movie was ever conceived.Since this movie is 'volume 1', it's not spoiler to say that by the end of this movie, The Bride has crossed some names off her list. The end credits are also interesting to read too. There's an 'RIP Charles Bronson' as well as the more mysterious 'Dustbusting David Geoghegan'. Huh? Perhaps most interestingly, the actor Sonny Chiba (who plays Hattori Hanzo in the movie) is later credited with being the movie's Samurai sword adviser. Maybe I'm a bit reticent, but I suspect that the credit stating that the character of 'The Bride' was created by Q & U refers to Quentin and Uma...but I haven't bothered verify that. Some puzzles for me: when The Bride wakes from her coma, she looks at the lines on her palm...what's the signficance of that? There's also something weird going on when the perspective on a sniper shot seems to change.If you're watching this movie on video, maybe check out what The Bride has written on the soles of her shoes! It's near the end of the movie, where there is a glass floor in a restaurant.",8,0,4,17 January 2016
Logan," Emotional. The best X-Men movie of the series (that I've seen). 85+%
","I became interested in seeing this film after I saw Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart interviewed on ABC TV's (Australia) 'Lateline' programme. Here's the link to that interview (01/03/2017), with a transcript and video of the segment:http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2016/s4628874.htmI'm surprised to see that it looks like I've only reviewed 'The Wolverine' at this site, which I scored 72.5+%, however, I have seen the first X-Men film in the series, at least. Which is to say that I'm a casual viewer of this franchise and I'm not particularly invested in the characters, so for me to like a film in this series so much speaks volumes for what they've accomplished here. It's a movie which effectively manipulates your emotions, in a way that other, lesser films, attempt to do, but fail, for example 'Star Wars: The force awakens'. Seeing as 'The Wolverine' was the last X-Men related film in this franchise that I've seen, I can't say that I've kept abreast of what's happened in this universe. By the looks of it, the mutants of this world are no longer a force. The reasons why are, presumably, covered in previous instalments of this franchise. In any case, there seems to be a little expository dialogue by the characters to help you understand what's going on better.Logan (The Wolverine) and Charles Xavier (Professor X) are living in less than ideal circumstances. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are both very good in the physicality of these now older, more feeble mutants (maybe that's not so much 'acting' from Stewart!). Jackman's Logan looks a bit like Saddam Hussein, just after he's emerged from his 'spider hole' (foxhole)!The major narrative arc of this film concerns Logan having to – unwillingly – escort a young girl to safety from what looks like a paramilitary operation which desperately wants to capture her. Visually, the film has touches of movies like Mad Max 2 for its vehicle action and it probably has similarities to an American Western which is regarded as a classic, but which I don't think that I've seen. In case naming that film might provide some spoilers, I'll refrain from doing that, but this film does show clips from that old movie and even reiterates dialogue from it. There's a scene with Logan and his ute which reminded me of a similar scene involving Basil Fawlty from the TV series 'Fawlty Towers', but stripped of the hilarity of that earlier Britcom. There are actually some amusing scenes in this film...an unintentional example of that was Logan at a funeral near the start of the film...seeing what he does with litter, the phrase 'Keep America tidy' popped into my head! It should also be pointed out that the film does get 'meta' at times...there's an interesting series of comic books which appear in this film!There was an enjoyable interlude in this film with a family which invites Logan, Charles and the girl to dinner. Seeing as what the family looked like, I did wonder how things would develop and my hypothesis was borne out, as far as the family was concerned.Back to the topic of emotion in this film (as a viewer response)...it's delivered. Near the end of the film, there's a scene where Logan enters the fray. Whilst it didn't fill me with joy, it was pleasurable, which is unusual in these kinds of Hollywood superhero or action movies where they aim to produce this feeling in you...but fail. The last scene featuring Logan also produced an emotional response in me, of a different kind. Again, the contrast with 'Star Wars: The force awakens' is marked, where the scene designed to produce that feeling in you failed to deliver it, again.Miscellaneous observations:* A Johnny Cash song opens the closing credits. For a moment I thought that the song was 'A boy named Sue'...which would have totally spoiled the moment! Firstly, I'm not that familiar with Cash's music, but I did realise that I knew the song that he was actually singing (vaguely). Interestingly, the credits list the song's writer as 'John R. Cash' and the performer as 'Johnny Cash'! Also interesting was hearing the line, perhaps for the first time, concerning what the singer was kicking against...I had heard it before with regard to Australian alternative artist Nick Cave...but looking up that phrase now on Wikipedia, it seems that perhaps both Cash and Cave were referencing a bible quotation, surprisingly, rather than it being a case of Cave referencing Cash. Just looked up the name of the song that Cash sings in the end credits, 'The man comes around'...it mentions that Cave actually sang on that Cash album of cover songs!* I have no idea how or if this film differs to any comic book treatment of the life of Logan. Whatever the case, I do like how this film deals with his story.* It's possible that the Lateline interview has Jackman mentioning that he wanted this film to be rated 'R', for artistic reasons. Here in Australia, it has an MA15+ rating, which means that children under 15 years of age can't see the film except with an adult accompanying them. Interestingly, the 'R' rating which this film gets in the US means that children under the age of 17 can't see the film, except with an adult accompanying them. As for this violence, the film does get quite bloody but doesn't reach the point of requiring the next restriction in Australian ratings, 'R', for people 18 years of age or older. Not even being accompanied by an adult would allow somebody of under the age of 18 to be able to view such a film.In closing, I appreciated the sombre, gritty nature of this film and the lack of the previous instalments' risible elements, such as bizarre mutant abilities (like controlling the weather, ffs!).",9,3,8,10 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Fight fight fight, talk talk talk. The Avengers Show. 65%
","Not so much bigger and better than it's predecessor (which I scored 77.5% at this site) than bigger and worser. Presumably this movie is superhero action fanboy porn. If it succeeds on that level, it was more of a letdown for me. The first movie was quite funny and I remember enjoying it...even if I now don't remember much (or anything) of it. So, here's why I think this movie isn't that good...personally, I can't imagine wanting to watch this movie again, even if it was passable entertainment. Perhaps - one day - I could return to watch the first Avengers movie but not this one: the entire movie is one frenetic fight scene after another and whilst being action-packed, it just didn't engage me at all. A sign of a good movie of this sort would be having characters that you feel for and revel in their heroics...you want to - ideally - be exhilarated and overjoyed by their derring-do. You want to cheer them. Literally. There's just no euphoria watching the action unfold. That just didn't happen for me. If the next movie in this series is similarly 'bigger and better', I probably won't watch it. Already feel that it would take something special for me to continue watching this series (I never watched the second Thor movie, nor have I even seen one Captain America movie). Also, it seems that this movie features some characters from a TV series based on this universe...so...I had no idea who some of those people were. I n that way, perhaps, the movie presupposes too much knowledge (or interest) in some characters. There are some vaguely interesting themes in this movie but it just doesn't feel like a good story. It feels more like a Readers Digest version of a story...as told by someone with ADD. That's the critical flaw of this movie...not a great story...just a lot of fighting, some talking and then some more fighting. And the fighting - whilst spectacular - isn't particular impressive as far as aesthetics go, or drama. Instead of good drama, you just get more bodies on the screen...fighting.A positive of the movie is the incidental humour. It's not exactly quotably funny, but it's funny in a 'you had to be there' kind of way. A negative of the movie is the sometimes indecipherable dialogue from the main cast. Even though one character has an excuse of not having English as a first language (the female mind reader character...whatever she was called) , I was amused to think that she said to the villain of this piece (Ultron, towards the end of the movie): 'Do you know how to fart?'. Some later contextual vision gives me a better idea of what she said...but not much.In this movie, stuff happens...that's all a bit silly. This would actually be a good movie to score purely on a 'pass'/'fail' basis. It's a pass. That's all.In some ways, this franchise is like the Iron Man franchise...starts off well, then peters out. I do think that I've seen all three (?) Iron Man movies though. Not sure if I'll stick with that one either.Just by the by, I noticed in the end credits listings for Film Victoria and Australia, I think. Not sure why.",6,3,8,7 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Too much of The Joker is barely enough!
","Having seen the original of this new series years ago, I can't say that I can remember much of it, apart from remembering that it had a really long pre-amble to how Batman came to be. So, I'll have to admit that it was the buzz around Heath Ledger's performance as 'The Joker' that roused me to watch the sequel to the first movie. More on that later.Since I've seen this movie not too long after I saw another super-hero movie, 'Iron Man' (starring Edward Norton), you can't help but notice the debt that Norton's character owes to Batmannamely, an impossibly wealthy man with a sense of noblesse oblige who, with their financial resources, provides the kind of service that the U.S., the wealthiest nation on Earth, can't seem to provide its own citizens. It's a monopoly service at thatonly Edward Norton's Tony Stark/Iron Man and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman have the resources to provide a high level of security and they don't share those resources with the military or the police, who could really use their high-tech gadgetry.Anyway, this latest installment in the Batman franchise sees Wayne/Batman pondering whether his hometown really needs him anymore, as a hero with a known identity , Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart), is doing a good job cleaning up the city in his role as the District Attorney for Gotham. Wayne thinks that maybe a masked crusader is less effective than someone like Dent, who does not hide their identity. The efforts of Dent and Batman see organised crime try to tilt the playing field in their favour.The joker in the pack is, of course, The Joker, played by Heath Ledger. Having seen Jack Nicholson play this role in the previous Batman franchise, I am inclined to think that Ledger's and Nicholson's Joker are not light years apartthough my memory is decidedly wonky on Nicholson's movie. They are both light years apart from the live action TV series interpretation of the character in any case. It must be said, however, that Ledger's Joker is better written and acted than previous incarnations (well, his Ledger's interpretation of the character resonates more powerfully today, perhaps).Ledger deserves to be nominated for acting awards for his performance. Not only is Ledger brilliant in his role, this role is brilliant for him. He steals the movie. In contrast to Bale's mostly dour and earnets characters (Wayne/Batman only rarely has something amusing to say, unlike Stark/Iron Man), Ledger commands attention. His Joker is menacing and thuggish. For him, it's 'kill or be killed' and either outcome is welcome, unlike for us mere mortals where the first is hard and the second is terrifying. You enjoy his philosophy on life and you want to hear more of it...from a safe distance! It's rare to see such a worthy adversary for a hero...complex and with an onion skin. I kept wanting to see and hear more of Ledger's Joker. Ledger's death robs us of the possibility of an encore performance. This movie and role is as good as 'Two hands' for Ledger (an Australian movie).Even though the first movie in this series wasn't very memorable, I think that Ledger's performance could see this sequel as being the Batman movie which has a lot of life in it...a movie that you can return to every few years and enjoy it as much as you did the first time around. That is a very rare thing for such a movie.R.I.P. Heath Ledger. Hopefully the producers of Dark Knight will now rest The Joker too...it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role now. The last thing I'd want to see would be an inferior version of Ledger's Joker.P.S. Is it just me, or does this movie seem a bit of an apologia for President Bush's actions during the so called 'war on terror'?78/100",8,1,4,30 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Main characters seem to go AWL...
","(This is a review of the IMAX version, which has some 3D parts.)The basic story arc of this latest installment in the Harry Potter franchise is the attempt by The Ministry of Magic to change the curriculum at Hogwarts' in order to prevent some sort of conspiracy against them. This involves the movie's Big Bad, Mrs Umbridge teaching a 'theoretical' course at Hogwarts, involving no learning of practical magic. Umbridge comes across as a cross between the Queen of England or ex P.M. Margaret Thatcher, crossed with Attila the Hun, and fuelled by a crystal meth suppositary somewhere it would be impolite of me to mention.Our hero, Harry Potter, feeling this beaureaucratic meddling at Hogwarts to be a threat to the students' safety, takes matters into his own hands.Daniel Radcliffe, playing Potter, seems to be growing too fast for this role. Perhaps future installments, requiring a more believable incarnation as the hero, could employ Ronnie Corbett as Potter.The lovely Emma Watson, has less opportunity to be lovely in this movie than previously. She seems to be greying to fast for my liking. If Watson gets too greedy with pay demands, perhaps Germaine Greer could play Hermione in future Potter movies. Watson does steal a scene in the movie though...where she defends Potter's kissing standards to Ron Weasley.Helena Bonham-Carter appears in this movie and hasn't looked so alluring since her star turn in the great 'A room with a view'.And one girl, who apparently won a contest to appear in this movie, makes a good show as a dreamy girl who, like Harry, can see things others can't.Now for why the IMAX version is the one to see, if you can. The height of the screen makes the viewing experience more immersive than even the new supersized suburban cinema screens. And the sound isn't as deafening as in those same suburban cinemas. Yet you get marvellous, floor shaking sound at IMAX (literally).The 3d is astounding. Flying creatures seem to reach into your lap at times! However, apart from that scene, the 3D isn't as utilised as well as it could be...e.g.the setting concerning the location of a magical orb isn't as impressive as it could have been-if there had been more scenes as impressive as the one in which Harry's ride seems to jut out meters in front of the screen and very near you, it would have been more impressive. The IMAX 3D system is vastly superior though, to the awful red and blue glasses version, which just gives bad 3D and looks hyper-ugly on screen...the IMAX glasses look like sunglasses-they don't even seem to be blue, like I think I remember them being the last time I saw an IMAX 3D film, many years ago.NOT having read any of the Potter books, I just wonder if the movie is true to the book-as old favourites like Hermione, Ron and Malfoyle seem to have very little to do in this movie.",7,0,0,20 July 2007
Elysium," Mad Max...with a Hollywood budget. 80+%
","This film really grabbed my attention with its opening shots...an urban canyon with decaying skyscrapers...such an iconic image. Where can I buy the poster? Anyway, it's that image which put in mind the thought that if the Australian movie 'Mad Max' (or its sequel) had a budget, that's how it might have spent the money instead of doing it on the cheap, on the outskirts of Woop Woop. There is definitely a 'Mad Max 2' aesthetic at work in some scenes, especially the ones featuring cars. Then you'll see a grand image outside of Earth and think that image was taken from '2001: A space odyssey'. Or you'll see an image and recognise 'The terminator' reference. 'Elysium' nicely homages these movies without feeling derivative.The plot of the movie concerns Max's (hmm...surely that's not a co-incidence? Played by Matt Damon in any case) need to go to the titular space station in order to cure himself from a terminal disease due to a workplace accident (the scene where that occurred put in mind those Work Safe ads you see here in Australia!). The Earth that Max lives on is basically a slum like environment. Even though I haven't read any books by Charles Dickens, the phrase 'Dickensian' definitely comes to mind for that vision of Earth's future workplace!In contrast to this future Earth, Elysium is a paradise orbiting Earth for the privileged. They have clean air, acres of private gardens for everyone and a medical pod in each home which can literally cure anything. Watching the movie I felt quite clever for seeing the implications of this state of affairs. Surprisingly, the movie rams home the implications for that at the end. I like that narrative device in the movie...you really can't argue the toss on the morality and ethics of that situation. On Elysium, to be without privilege is terrifying for the inhabitants...hence the martial presence which is subtle in those early scenes.Apart from movie homages, I was playing 'spot the real world equivalents' throughout as well. Much of the movie is set in a predominantly Spanish speaking Los Angeles. It made me wonder if this represents an actual fear of some Americans. Of course, the modern day equivalent is the situation with Mexicans attempting to sneak into the U.S. for a better chance of success in life in America. In this movie, you could view Elysium as 'New America' and Los Angeles as 'New Mexico'...which is probably historically accurate, as the U.S. sneakily annexed land from Mexico centuries ago and incorporated it into what is now the U.S. of A. Anyway, for obvious reasons many of the people of Los Angeles also wish to escape to Elysium for reasons of a better life or just to save a loved one dying of something.If Elysium is meant to be 'New America', it is disguised...perhaps they speak French there? (there was language switching in Los Angeles too, but I don't know if that was meant to show bilingualism or a transition to something the audience wouldn't require subtitles for). Jodie Foster plays security bigwig 'Delacourt' on Elysium. Perhaps she is meant to have a South African accent but if she does, it's an interesting 'failure'...a hybrid of South African, English and perhaps French too...which I liked. In a film like this there really wouldn't be a 'wrong' accent...like there would in Meryl Streep's take on Lindy Chamberlain in 'Evil angels'. Definitely sounding South African is dodgy security contractor 'Kruger' (played by Sharlto Copley). For some reason he brought weird South African music group Die Antwoord to mind...I mean the male singer of that...not that I've heard much of them! You even see the South African flag on his spaceship...in Los Angeles.Other modern day equivalences are brought to mind by this movie. The role of the current U.S. government in military operations and surveillance is brought to mind as was the previous government's reliance on private military contractors (like Blackwater). Some shots with thermal vision (I think) remind me of that Wikileaks' footage of U.S. helicopter gunships killing innocent civilians abroad and Kruger actually brings to mind some of the atrocities of Al-Qaeda (I mean his work with his sword).If I have one criticism of the movie it is that it reverted to Hollywood type as far as the actions of Elysium's regular President at the end of the movie (played by Faran Tahir). It didn't have to play out like that and in fact the eventual outcome isn't really justified by the personal histories of those we have come to know in this movie...it assumes too much for what happens, in other words.I like 'Elysium''s mythic quality, one which it shares with Mad Max 2. Emma Tremblay was really sweet as the daughter of Max's young love 'Frey' (played by Alice Braga)...especially in that scene where she tells Max a story. I'm guessing that internet forums devoted to this movie will have plenty of people wanting to know what moral Max gleaned from that story at the end of the movie.A very nice movie and I think it will have repeat viewing value...my provisional score for this movie kept going up as it progressed...from 75% to 75+ (which translates from 7 stars to 8 stars on this site) to 77.5% to 77.5+%. Final score 80+%.",8,4,7,27 August 2013
Avatar," A magical world...
","I was reluctant to watch this movie as it did have some less than ringing endorsement in some reviews. Mostly I was reluctant to watch this movie as it was as huge as James Cameron's 'Titanic', and I had some issues with how the story in that was told...watching 'Titanic', I kept thinking that there were better ways that the story could have been told (I reviewed that movie here too). The positive comments I'd heard about the 3D experience made me want to see this movie...eventually. Watched it last week.Anyway, I had less problems with this movie than with Titanic. There have been numerous articles in the press about plot-holes in 'Avatar', but I steered clear of reading them. Can't say that I really noticed too many or thought that they ruined the movie.It was my choice to watch this movie at iMax, here in Australia, as I find their screens more immersive and, more importantly, their sound levels are loud and deep and powerful without being deafening like the suburban chains are.The plot of the movie concerns a human expedition to an inhabited moon in a far flung galaxy. Humans seek to mine a certain mineral but have humanoid natives to deal with. They try to get the humanoids to accept mining on their moon voluntarily. There is also a large military contingent accompanying the humans...presumably just in case the natives are amenable to their plans.To get the natives (known as 'Na'vi') to accede to their desire to mine their moon, the human contingent have created hybrid human/Na'vi bodies, in which to transfer the consciousness of people like scientists and military personnel. These hybrids are the 'avatars' of the title. The strategy is to gain the trust of the Na'vi and have them agree to their plans.Things don't go according to plan. One of the humans, Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), falls in love with one of the Na'vi (Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana) when he is inhabiting the human/Na'vi hybrid. Part of Jake's essential conflict is a moral choice between carrying out the humans plans versus respecting the wishes of the Na'vi.Pandora, the moon the Na'vi inhabit, is magical to look at, and even more magical when experienced in 3D. It is a well realised world...copious plants and exotic animals dwell on it. It's this world which makes 'Avatar' such a compelling movie-going experience.My initial impulse was to give this movie 9/10, but I'm giving it 8/10 as the one thing this movie lacks is an emotional core. It's wonderful to look at, but it was mostly spectacle to me, and not much emotional involvement.I do have to say though that it's my impression that it's a very human characteristic of colonisers to at first wish to destroy anything which does not bow to their will. After all resistance has been crushed, nostalgia is created for the vanquished...place names take on native titles, as do streets etc. One can say that 'Avatar' has its heart in the right place, but it is a heart full of nostalgia for what must 'necessarily' be destroyed in the real world of the coloniser. In this way 'Avatar' is a 'what if' kind of story...and maybe one I feel sympathetic too, as applied to the real world.",8,1,4,7 March 2010
The Artist," The future of filmmaking? 72.5%
","I'm guessing that the world has been screaming out for silent, black and white movies this year in the wake of slow and plodding cinema releases recently like 'Hugo' and 'Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy'.This movie deals with the historical transition from silent movies to 'talkies', in the late 1920s, and the effects that this has on an established star of the silent movie era (George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin).Even though this movie is in black and white and is, for the most part, silent, it's entertaining enough, in its own way. Dujardin must be a good actor, because in one scene, in front of a mirror with an attractive woman, he is actually looking at the woman's reflection and not himself in the mirror...the narcissistic nature of the acting profession means that that sight is as rare as hen's teeth. He is also amusing in the moments where he readies himself to be filmed for a scene. The cast do tend to recreate the acting styles of the silent era and one could say, perhaps, that Dujardin's eyebrows are more expressive than Laurence Olivier's ever were...that's a joke...not in the sense that Olivier's eyebrows were peerless...never mind...Dujardin's face is quite ye olde expressive, even if his eyebrows may not be...which I don't remember in any case!I did enjoy the scene where rising star Peppy Miller (played by Bérénice Bejo) has a moment with Valentin's coat. Nice.The film does lightly touch on some significant moments of the era, like the Other event of 1929.Some people just seem born for this era of filmmaking...can you imagine how big a star Fran Drescher could have been at that time?Anyway, this movie has some good physical comedy and 'lines'. Many critics are mentioning the dog as being a star of this movie.Did manage to predict things in this movie...e.g. the kind of thing to happen when the feather dropped...what was in that locked box in Valentin's house.If there is actual sound recording of the cast of this movie acting, that might be fun as a DVD extra for this movie...I would definitely give that a burl!",7,1,4,15 February 2012
A Clockwork Orange," Has one of the best scenes of all time
","I'm writing this review years after seeing this movie. The reason? Just because I think it has one of the all time great scenes in movies...the scene where the anti-hero of the piece finds religion. When you see why he is attracted to Christianity, you will soil yourself! I think this scene illustrates the human condition...we believe all sorts of things without really understanding them, which is why this scene is so funny.Anyway, this is a movie about a gang of thugs who terrorise people. The State captures one and tries to 'reform' him...using some quite disturbing techniques. Perhaps this film is about human nature and whether it can be changed or not.This film has many images that will stick with you forever-the sequence where the anti-hero discovers religion; the scene where the State tries to 'reform' the anti-hero, and some of the bizarre art featured in it-like the statues of the ladies in a bar, or the giant rocking gonad.A disturbing yet funny movie about bad eggs and 'remedies' for them.",9,3,6,20 March 2008
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," More a celebration of sickness and perversion than fascist critique
","You cannot watch this movie. No, I mean literally you cannot watch it. It's been banned in Australia (on and off). Many years ago I took the opportunity to watch this movie when it was briefly unbanned and I had heard good things about it on the original Movie Show, with David and Margaret. I think David said something along the lines that this movie was a scathing critique of Nazism or fascism or something-my response to this later.Anyway, the movie is based on a book or something by the doomed pre Revolutionary French aristocrat the Marquis de Sade (can you guess how this will turn out yet?). From the writings of de Sade, we get the term 'sadism' (guessed yet?). Oddly, whilst browsing the 'classics' section of a bookshop, I noticed that it contained stuff by de Sade!The movie updates the setting of the original to more contemporary times-the Mussolini era of Italian history, I think.Back to Stratton's comments on the movie-I couldn't disagree more. I found this movie to be a celebration of sickness and perversion. Sadists would like this movie, I think, but not if they baulk at murder. Masochists (named after the Dolphin de Maso...look him up) would not, as the cruelty in this movie is not consensual...no 'safety' words here, like 'God that hurts!!'-words being unutterable in some cases in this movie.Even though I don't remember too much of the context of the movie-I do recall what you would call 'the victims' entering this environment-maybe it's some military establishment or something. And I remember some of the EXTREME cruelty perpetrated on them. There is blood in this movie and some of the scenarios are really horrible.Also memorable are the scenes of 'feasting'. Eating what? Er, I'm not talking cannibalism here...but gee, you wouldn't want to plan eating sticky date pudding afterwards!I also remember one scene-in long shot, thankfully, where I blinked before the director did...in other words, when something gory is about to happen, you don't get a cut away...you have to endure the horror, unless, like I did, you turn away in horror.Perhaps this movie is rightly banned, at least here in Australia-not a case of nanny-state meddling. Now, THIS is hardore.",1,7,23,20 June 2008
Titanic," Spectacular, but with lots of flaws
","After seeing this movie years ago at the cinema I thought it was one of the worst movies of all time (as far as major studio pictures go). Thinking about it before posting up a review here, maybe I was a bit too harsh.In short, this story is a fictional tale of two star-crossed lovers on board a real life, famous ship (the 'Titanic') that sank, killing a great percentage of its passengers and crew (um, sorry if that is a spoiler, but sheesh, you SHOULD know that!).When I am feeling particularly unkind about this film, some of my criticisms are: only director James Cameron could look at the story of the Titanic and think 'Hmmm. That story could make a good movie...IF ONLY IT HAD MORE DRAMA!'. Yeah, sinking ship, hundreds dead, needs MORE drama!Another peeve about this movie is how Cameron can't resist manipulating our sympathies to characters by resorting to melodrama and crudely drawn characters who we find easy to hate, in order to have us rooting for other characters. E.g. Billy Zane's character of Hockley. Didn't quite throw a chihuahua into the ice-cold ocean, but nasty enough to do everything short of this. Really, a more sophisticated script could have made him a figure deserving of our sympathy too.A minor peeve is how one of those star crossed lovers, Kate Winslet's Rose, is quite prescient and insightful about the ship's situation...just didn't seem very plausible for one so young and unschooled in such matters.Despite thinking this movie one of the all time stinkers (for a major studio release) I did, at the time, think it a master-stroke to have the two star-crossed lovers at the centre of this tale (Kate Winslet's 'Rose' and Leonardo DiCaprio's 'Jack'). It is just a brilliant device in order to hook you and reel you into this great historical drama/tragedy. Again, it was a great pity that Cameron chose not to make a victim of people like Hockley as well, instead of demonising him. And it's not as if Cameron didn't have alternatives in his own script. For instance, Jack's sketching of Rose could have provided a more believable foundation on which to base a relationship on instead of the hysterical melodrama Cameron resorts to to get them together.Perhaps the time-frame of the sinking made melodrama necessary.Truly spectacular but deserved Razzies for things like script and direction.Despite my criticisms, when Titanic eventually hits the ice-berg, the movie is an absolute thrill ride and quite exhilarating.P.S. must put in a word for the great Australian song by Flash and the Pan 'Down among the dead men'. It's not in this movie (Celine Dion does the theme song), but the Flash and the Pan song is actually about the Titanic and is a brilliant pop song...beautiful too. Look it up on You Tube.",4,5,8,4 July 2008
Castle in the Sky," Enjoyable fairtytale with some great graphics...
","Saw this on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled 'Laputa: Castle in the sky'. I had enabled subtitles and I think SBS provided their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality.Just looked up 'Laputa' on Wikipedia and it confirms what I suspected...the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel 'Gulliver's travels', which was published in the early to mid 1700s.Anyway, this is an engaging Japanese fairytale, which features an English speaking voice-cast. It's suitable for young children, I think, but it does run at just over two hours in length, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me.The story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it. The children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, the army and spies looking for the island too, and looking to capture the children (Sheeta, the girl, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) in order to help them find it.The graphics are magnificent...sort of photo-realistic at times, especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch-light, or the pretty scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or mist.Recommended.",7,1,3,10 September 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," What a GREAT ad for the movie! Classic!
","Seeing the ads in cinemas for this movie made me keen to see it, despite misgivings...the ads had a great sense of drama and gravitas to them. On this site I gave the original movie 7/10 and called it a good popcorn movie, even though the early part of that movie was really bad and took a while to improve.Did start hearing bad things from movie reviewers which made me think I should give this movie a miss...but a cinema chain here in Australia had a promotion where I won a discount ticket, so I waited until this movie was off the No Free List category to see it.So, where does this movie go wrong? Well, at least the original movie had humour going for it...it took a while to get going, after initially being cringe-worthy. The sequel doesn't have any humour worth noting. It's not even cringe-inducing. You just have a blank expression when they try it on.Worst of all, in an effort, perhaps, to compensate for the mechanical characters' lack of charisma and empathy, the movie goes down the awful George Lucas route, creating a couple of mechanical characters (known as 'Don't Know' and 'Don't Care'...just kidding on that, although I really don't know these characters' names) modelled on Jar Jar Binks...loosely based on racial and ethnic stereotypes in the human world. Not being American, I can't say that I really find their brand of American jive-talk very entertaining at all. It's really awful...small boys may like their humour and machismo though.What is watching this movie like? Well, it's like spending around two and a half hours with drunk, spaced out, self-obsessed teenagers talking about EVERYTHING...or, watching small boys play in a sandpit with Transformers toys, and listening to their running commentary-for two and half hours-...or watching teenage boys playing the new Transformers video game...for TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!Sure, there is LOTS of action in this movie. But to tell you the truth, this series ends here for me. Enough is enough. Director Michael Bay would really have only one way to 'improve' on this movie next time round...two and a half hours of a single Transformers chase where pretty much everything en route gets destroyed. Even if he did this, I wouldn't watch it...because this is just one big, stupid, action packed movie. The destruction wreaked in the first movie was entertaining. And the ads for the sequel seemed even more exciting, in this regard. But it just doesn't impress as much when married into this tedious movie.Like the first movie, the film makers either seem to not know who they are pitching this movie at, or, more likely, perhaps, they are trying to appeal to all ages, which makes some of the material in this movie inappropriate to young children (there is much leering camera work in this movie of young bodies etc).With regards to the sexual aspects to this movie, I must say I have been misinformed...seeing girlie calenders in motor mechanic garages, I always thought that the scantily dressed beautiful young women draped over motorcycles were being sexually exploited...turns out they were putting artwork on the bikes instead! Megan Fox's character demonstrates this early on...and you get a nice, leering shot up her shorts...think you see panty too.In other words, this is about two and a half hours of things blowing up (for small boys) and titillation (for teenage boys).Do yourself a favour-record the ad for this movie when it plays on TV. And when you think you want to watch the movie, watch the ad instead. It's really good!Three words: T.D.S.",4,3,9,23 July 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Dated, but of historical curiosity
","I saw this movie a few years back and I just want to note something that I found intriguing about it. Before that, however, I'll just provide a brief synopsis of the plot: a newly married couple move into a town-house & prepare for the birth of their new child. An element of surreality does enter into the equation & I suppose part of of hook of the movie is wondering whether the wife's paranoia about her unborn child's nature is well founded or hysterical. In the movie, there are hints that her circumstances are a vast conspiracy-involving her husband, neighbours and...Satan!One thing that this movie did clear up, was the question of what inspired the 'Tupperware witches' sketches in the Australian sketch comedy show 'Fast Forward'. I think that this movie may have been the source of these sketches!Interestingly, an SBS TV (Australia) documentary in September 07 entitled 'The history of the Devil' mentioned this movie too, along with another movie that I've reviewed here, The Exorcist. I'll mention those points below, but first a warning...the comments below are spoilers, to a lesser or greater extent. Maybe read the stuff below after you've watched the movie.Potential spoilers: In the documentary above, The Exorcist is described as a Christian fightback to this movie, in that in Rosemary's Baby, the Devil triumphs. The Exorcist sees Good triumphing over Evil.Rosemary's Baby is described as a product of the counter-cultural movement during the Vietnam War in the 1960's, a time when The Establishment (Government, Capitalism and Religion) were viewed with suspicion and hostility. During this time, Satanism was seen by some as an antidote to The Establishment.Anyway, I wasn't overly impressed with this movie. It's OK. what I did find intriguing was the implication that God did a poor job designing humans. In the metaphysical conflict between Good and Evil, God seems to have made a monumental mistake in allowing a woman's maternal instinct to over-ride eternal consequences.",6,1,3,3 June 2008
Zero Dark Thirty," Odd mix of the serious and Hollywood action movie clichés. 75%
","'Zero dark thirty' is quite a dry movie and its endgame looks like a fly-on-the-wall documentary. Presumably you are well aware of the resolution to this tale - the execution of Usama bin Laden - but are more interested in how his demise came about. In broad-brush strokes, this movie tells that story. One issue I had with this movie was just being baffled about who the terrorist suspects were...I feel that an actual documentary would just have a greater feeling of coherence as to how all the pieces of this 'jigsaw' puzzle fit together. Sometimes it wasn't even clear to me what was happening...as with that sequence where a Middle-Eastern looking man is fitted up with...something...and notices women (?) in full Muslim cover around him.Jessica Chastain stars as 'Maya', a crucial C.I.A. operative in the hunt for U.B.L. At the start of the movie she comes across as being a work experience would be torturer or something and progresses to following the script on the strategy to get information from detainees. I'm not exactly sure what Maya's position title in the C.I.A. was, but she does appear to have more clout than her seniority would dictate.I am curious if many of the comments she makes actually happened. It's these moments of bravado or vulgarity which make this movie come across as some sort of Hollywood action movie...Maya's dialogue is along the lines of something you would expect Eddie Murphy to utter in 'Beverly Hills cop' or Bruce Willis in 'Die hard'. They didn't really ring true to me. Fair enough if she actually said this, but hopefully these weren't inventions to make the movie function as a C.I.A. recruiting ad. Other times Maya looks like a sitcom character or a Little Princess having a hissy fit. I have in mind that part of the movie where Maya writes numbers ostentatiously in lipstick on her superior's window. Again, fair enough if this actually happened, but if not, it just seems a clumsy way to make Maya look 'sassy' or...whatever.For a while I made a point of not reading reviews of this movie or articles which delved into it and the topic of torture. That was short lived. Before watching this movie I did read a couple of articles, one a review, I think, and one on the topic of torture. What I saw on the screen was not particularly horrific...I was perhaps expecting some stomach-churning gore as you might see (implied) on the TV drama '24', as practiced by the anti-terrorism agent Jack Bauer. There was nothing so bad as that...which is not to say that the torture you do see inflicted by the C.I.A. is not horrific if you imagined yourself being subject to it. It's just not horrific, in other words.From my own point of view, I think there is one issue which is relevant which the movie does not cover...all the times that torture was inflicted on people who were actually innocent. In the movie, the tortured were always guilty, so 'the end justifies the means', one could argue. If we saw depicted horrific torture which was of no purpose, our views on the practice could be challenged.One of the articles that I read was 'Tortured justifications' by Waleed Aly in The Age newspaper (07/02/2013?). His view was that since director Kathryn Bigelow got most of her information from the C.I.A., the movie is pretty much supports what they did. Before I had watched the movie, I did read Bigelow's article where she said depicting the torture in the movie was not condoning it. Years ago I watched a very interesting documentary called 'Operation Hollywood' which outlined how movies which used U.S. military props or whathaveyou were subject to censorship by the U.S. military...in other words, they got to say how they were depicted...for instance, they insisted a story element from 'Lassie' be removed...one which implied that the U.S. military might make defective products. The point of raising all this is just to suggest that I hope Bigelow isn't a C.I.A. dupe or apologist...the former charge being more serious, perhaps.In any case, the torture was not that big of an issue for me. And I had even less problems with the U.S. taking the action it did against U.B.L. without authorisation from the sovereign nation (Pakistan) where he had been 'hiding'.Points of interest: * I did find the actions of one C.I.A. woman in this movie incredibly stupid (naive at best), which had devastating consequences for U.S. citizens...the one where she does not follow strict protocol.* Was it necessary to shoot (kill?) U.B.L's wife? * I get the impression that a British actor played the role of a senior (government?) figure in this movie...and I wasn't convinced he was an American...I would have guessed it was the guy from 'The thick of it' who swears a lot (I've not seen that series though)...but looks like I'm wrong on that.* Usama bin Laden is referred to as 'UBL' by the Americans...I had read somewhere that the U.S. made a point of spelling his name 'Osama' as they didn't like the fact that he had 'USA' in his name (i.e. 'Usama'). So, it's interesting that they call him 'UBL' for that reason. Calling him 'Osama' in general thus seems like a propaganda move.* Surprised to see two Australians in this movie...the Edgerton brothers.Personally, I would really like to see a movie or documentary concerning the events following 11/09/2001...the fact that the president of the U.S. (George W. Bush) ignored all evidence of Saudi Arabian involvement (the Bush family had lucrative relationships with Saudi royalty, I think, who were implicated in the attacks on U.S. soil in 2001. He also waged war on a nation not involved in those attacks on U.S. soil...as a useful diversion since Saudi Arabia was implicated?",7,3,5,12 February 2013
There Will Be Blood," A good, old fashioned Hollywood character study
","To me, this movie seems a throwback to movies of yore-character studies, usually with a famous Hollywood male or female lead to bring in the punter. It's title is perhaps designed to bring in the stoner who will at some point leave the theatre feeling totally ripped off that this isn't a horror/slasher movie.You will probably need to have a quite clear idea of what kind of movie this isn't before you can enjoy it. It isn't a horror/slasher movie. It's not a cowboy movie. It isn't a gore-fest. It is costume drama of sorts...it's set in turn of the last century America. That is one of the strengths of this movie-it's brilliant sense of place...barren American wasteland, drawing people there for one reason only...the promise of fortunes to be made, through finding gold or other precious metals. The landscape is befitting of the two protagonists of this film...uncompromising and unforgiving.Enter Daniel Day-Lewis, as Daniel Plainview. He is a gold prospector. He doesn't find much to rejoice at...until he finds oil. The early scenes go along way to defining the strengths and weaknesses of his character. The sheer toil of oil work is brilliantly evoked, along with the horrific work conditions...where death is one mishap away.One of the pleasures of this film is the relationship Daniel has with his son, H.W. Especially pleasurable is one scene he has with his baby son on a train...entrancing. The trajectory of that relationship, over the 30 year span of this movie is also fascinating, from a character study point of view.Another pleasing scene is where Daniel is at the altar of Eli's church. There is some wonderful byplay there. I don't think the byplay is of the story, but the actors seem to be having a ball and it shows. It's not of the movie, but it works well in any case. Um, I'm trying to say that I think the camera captured the actors having fun at the time and decided to leave the scene in there because it works.The other character of note is Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. Along with Day-Lewis, I think, Dano deserved to get nominated for some kind of acting award...supporting actor, say. Any criticism of Dano is ill-founded...he embodies all the qualities of Sunday perfectly. Perfect casting, in my view, as a preacher man on the make. Day-Lewis himself shows great diversity of emotional shading.For those who look to these things, you can interpret this movie, as was intended, I think, to view this as sort of a parable of the dance between religion and business in the US. This part of the movie is rewarding and you can interpret the movie in many ways-as being cynical about religion and preachers, or as demonstrating that God is. For instance, there is a scene where an oil platform catches fire. In a way, this scene is crucial. But, I suppose, the question you might want to ask yourself is: Is God here? I have my own opinions-to me the preacher man is parasitic on power, seeking it to elevate his own power and influence. Of course, you could see God in this picture and argue the reverse. The way Daniel must court religious influence for pragmatic reasons is also telling.Perhaps my favourite scene is where Eli tells Daniel of his business fortunes, near the end of the movie. As with the dates which flash up, time is important.Lastly, I can't say whether Daniel Day-Lewis does a bad American accent or not...he has a touch of the Sean Connery's with it. But that is easily rationalised, I suppose, due to the history of immigration to the US.It was my intention to give this movie 7/10, but the ending was brilliant-it really got to the heart of what this movie was about, I think.8/10",8,2,4,4 July 2008
Joker," Joker begins. Why so serious? [Score: 50%]
","Perhaps you should be careful what you wish for, as my review for 'The Dark Knight' had the headline 'Too much of The Joker is barely enough!' and I wrote near the end of my review, here, of Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker: 'You enjoy his philosophy on life and you want to hear more of it...from a safe distance! It's rare to see such a worthy adversary for a hero...complex and with an onion skin. I kept wanting to see and hear more of Ledger's Joker. Ledger's death robs us of the possibility of an encore performance. This movie and role is as good as 'Two hands' for Ledger (an Australian movie)'.Anyway, here it is, although I can't say that I was dead keen to see someone else in the role of Joker (Joaquin Phoenix, in this case). This film does seem to be critically hyped, with even talk of Oscar nominations, if not wins. Personally, it doesn't strike me as being a particularly good film...it would have to be a very weak award field for this to win anything, I think. Perhaps an award for cinematography? I dunno.The film 'Joker' provides a backstory to the creation of the supervillain Joker, from his origin as the depressing sad case Arthur Fleck. It is a dour film, seemingly aiming to be 'serious', so as to be eligible for Academy Award nomination consideration (Heath Ledger deservedly won an Oscar for his acting performance in 'The Dark Knight'). Not being a superfan of comics (well, not for a long time, at least, and not for Batman comics), I have no idea how the Joker's backstory in 'Joker' gels with any 'canonical' portrayal in comics or cartoons. I'm just struck wondering whether the backstory needed to be the one given to us. Couldn't it have been something else? Something better? 'Joker' is so dour that I can't really imagine anyone wanting to watch it again, 'for pleasure', as I could imagine myself doing for 'The Dark Knight', purely because of the character of The Joker and Heath Ledger's compelling portrayal of him.That being said, if having a backstory for Joker is of interest to you and you wonder how that ties in with the first in the recent Batman trilogy ('Batman begins'), this will no doubt be mandatory viewing for you. For me, I just wondered whether the intersection of 'Joker' and 'Batman begins' was too pat, too unnecessarily intertwined. Again, I have no idea whether this intersection is merely canonical or just too cute by half.Watching Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck (surely his entire name is deliberately apt, if you imagine a Cockney saying it?), many times, especially early on, he struck me as being mannered, stylised, with his twitching, occasionally effete manner and slumping around. In other words, he looked like he was acting. His appearance and physicality reminded me, at times, of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. De Niro has a significant role in this film as a nightly talk show host. There is an odd movement that Arhtur/Joker makes which made me scratch my head, figuratively speaking...is he doing Tai Chi? It looks something like that but perhaps it's a weird dance? Or both, depending on the moment? I dunno.Fleck is troubled, of course. He has 'problems'. At times I found myself wondering just how deep they went, though. For instance, it wasn't clear to me what was in his mind when he was looking rather too intently at a neighbour's daughter...on more than one occasion.The editing is dreamlike at times, lulling you into missing the slide from the reality of the world of the film to that of Fleck's mind. The editing can then make you aware of what's occurred but sometimes I'm not sure whether what I've just seen actually happened or not, e.g. when Arthur receives visitors at his flat.There are moments or things in the film which strike me as being unbelievable or implausible. The main one is that the world of this film is too like our own for it be plausible to me that someone like Arthur/Joker could actually become a supervillain...I'd have to assume that the police must be incompetent for that to transpire. On a more personal level in the film, I found that a relationship that Arthur formed to also be unbelievable but there is a resolution to that scenario which I found satisfactory.Early on and throughout the film you do get a sense of Gotham being a city divided by class, from the early newscast (which I unfortunately didn't pay a lot of attention to) to the flat where Arthur lives. That being said, this representation of an underclass didn't hit me with nearly the amount of force that I was hit with when I saw how Cliff Booth was living, in the recent Quentin Tarantino film 'Once upon a time in Hollywood'. The class divide in 'Joker' serves mainly to serve as a prop, in any case.Overall, 'Joker' hasn't captured the magic that Heath Ledger brought to the character in 'The Dark Knight', where I had my first stirrings that the character of Batman was boring and I just wanted the entire film to be about Ledger's Joker. These Jokers are poles apart. Ledger's was engaging and entertaining, whereas this film is neither of those two things. 'Joker' comes across as a cringe comedy...without the comedy (Fleck's first appearance on the talk show really did make me cringe...I just wanted the scene to stop!) or a mock-anti-epic...without the mockery. I did get one laugh during the movie (maybe two at the most, but I can't remember the other incident), i.e. an incident with a sliding door. In essence, this film is saying: 'This is serious!'. For this reason, I have to say that the film is not only not particularly engaging, worse, it's not entertaining to boot. Personally, watching this film again some time in the future holds no attraction for me.Miscellaneous:* The occasional violence in this film strikes me as being nastier than what I recall being in the last Batman trilogy, especially the murder of one man.* Odd POV moment with the camera when Arthur dives into the fridge.* Anachronistic: why was the audience in the film laughing so hard at an old Charlie Chaplin film? Canonical reference?* Train shootings: I didn't feel that the sleazes 'deserved' what happened to them.* Canonical that Joker's real identity known very early on?* I've reconsidered my score a few times: 60% to 55+% to 50%",5,2,9,13 November 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," An intriguing slice of Americana from living memory
","Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, this movie combines truth with fiction to illustrate a certain time in America's history. It takes a while to suss out the nature of this movie or what it's about. So, we're sort of like the nominal central character of the movie, 'Scout' (Mary Badham), the young daughter of Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), a hick town lawyer in America's Deep South (in the 1930s). Therefore, the early part of the movie has Scout be the centre of attention along with her childish concerns and relations with her younger brother and a new friend who is visiting.Later, this child centred point of view comes to encompass more adult concerns and, particularly, a legal case Atticus Finch has decided to take on...the defence of a black man charged with raping, I think, a white woman. At first, Atticus, seen from the children's' point of view is nothing special or exceptional. One of the pleasures of this movie is how their father transforms into someone to celebrate.Brilliantly evoking an America which existed even as little as 40 odd years ago, this movie and the book it was based on must have seemed a pebble in the shoe to a country which eulogised itself and its virtues.Finch, in court, is a quiet and smouldering figure exemplifying integrity and the pursuit of justice. Perhaps the court scenes aren't the most realistic ever filmed but the evidence conveyed is plausible and lucid. In fact, it's superior to the jury deliberations found in '12 angry men' which are somewhat logically jumpy. In other words, this movie seems to want to keep the court room evidence to a minimum for fear of boring us. It's brevity isn't a major flaw though.Sensitive issues are dealt with subtly in Mockingbird, but I do wonder if the fate of Finch's client was glossed over superficially without Finch type analysis from the film makers...or author?In black and white. Check out 'The curse of the Cat People' which I review here and also deals with the world of childhood.",8,1,1,30 May 2008
Edge of Tomorrow," Entertaining movie but lacks inspiration. 75%
","It was interesting to learn that this movie was based on a Japanese 'manga' called - amusingly - 'All you need is kill' by Hiroshi Sakurazaka (it sounds like one of those awful translations generated from a poor web based translation service!). Wikipedia says it was a novel with pictures but then turned into a manga as well. Be that as it may...The story itself is nonsense on stilts - of the kind that a small child could punch holes in the logic of - Earth is invaded by aliens humans dub 'mimics'. For the life of me I can't work out the relationship between that name and what they look like. The aliens look pretty abstract, which perhaps affected the way that I responded to them. They look computer generated and not nearly effective aesthetically as the non-computer generated alien in the movie 'Alien' or its sequels.The biggest nonsense of this movie is that the aliens have the ability to control time...to 'reset' to an earlier point in time which allows them to learn from their mistakes and thus defeat humanity's best efforts. If you've seen any ads for this movie you'll realise that Earth's hero, Major William Cage (played by Tom Cruise) acquires this time shifting ability of the aliens.Earth's resistance is co-ordinated by the UDF (United Defence Force), of which Major Cage will soon become a servant. The UDF's leader is General Brigham (played by Brendan Gleeson), an Englishman who - early on, especially - has a pinch of Winston Churchill about him. Tom Cruise's Major Cage has a pinch of Jack Nicholson about him early on too. Perhaps it was a choice of the film makers not to have the Earth's defences led by the US...as in it comes across as a 'team' effort to defeat the aliens, not the Americans being the sole heroes...then again, perhaps it's in the original novel too?Whilst set in the future, the imagery is not unlike something you might see in representations of World War I...and its sequel too, perhaps.More than one professional review mentions how this narrative device of time travel is like a video game. I can see that. Perhaps like a 'noob' war video game player, Major Cage is a coward but by a process of constantly dying at the hands of the enemy (that is where the time travel 'reset' device comes in), Cage eventually becomes a worthy opponent to the aliens...a hero, in other words. It's this kind of unrealistic and video game like 'cheat' which makes you wonder how much honour there is in potentially defeating the aliens by dying at their hands so often...but that is how the aliens came to be winning the war against humans in any case.The female character of Sergeant Rita Vrataski (played by Emily Blunt) has an interesting strand to her backstory. It concerns how she got the epithet 'Angel of Verdun' and how that relates to the aliens' 'long game' as far as their war with humanity goes.The concept of this movie was exciting and interesting to me but despite being an entertaining movie in itself, it didn't scale any greats heights for me. It lacks joy. It is, after all, a boy's own adventure tale. It just did not sweep me away like a movie of this sort should. Ideally you'd want the movie to be rousing and to love the characters. Perhaps one could say it is a little bit sterile in this regards?A sort of similar movie to this is 'Source code', which I gave 10/10 to on this site. Even though my memory of this movie has faded, I do remember that I loved it. Like 'Edge of tomorrow', it is not the acting or the characters or the script which win you over. Despite both having this 'flaw', 'Source code' manages to achieve a level of greatness which 'Edge of tomorrow' doesn't.Lastly, I'll just mention liking the score for the end credits...after the song. I liked the stereo field created in the cinema...how the music pans from one side to another and creates an aural space.Not a bad movie, in other words...but nowhere near as good as 'Source code'...or the truly great 'Dark city'...or even 'The 13th floor', which are all similarly 'concept movies.",7,1,3,4 July 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," If you grew up watching films from this era, you might enjoy it...
","The story is set in the 1950s, at a film studio where Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin) is a 'fixer'...if a problem arises in the making of a movie (be it with actors or whathaveyou), he'll 'fix' it. That could include things like getting an actor out of a difficult situation off the set, or...something more dramatic, as we sell when this film unfolds. Expecting to see George Clooney in this movie, for a moment I wondered if Eddie Mannix was being played by him...all old guys look alike, maybe?As I child, I'd remember seeing movies on the ABC (Australia) about cowboys and million dollar mermaids etc, so if you were growing up when those kinds of movies were being made and you went to the cinema to see them, you might get a lot out of the characters in this movie which play the knock-off versions of the real actors from that bygone era. For instance, I'd say that the character of DeeAnna Moran (played by Scarlett Johansson) is intended to be interpreted as being Esther Williams, who starred in 'Million dollar mermaid' (about the Australian swimmer Annette Kellerman). 'Million dollar mermaid' no doubt had some choreographed dance routines done in the water which were created (I would learn in a documentary many years later) by Busby Berkeley...and you get to see that recreated in this movie...or reinterpreted, as I'm no expert on this subject.Since this movie is billed as a comedy, I have to say I did get a few laughs out of it. E.g. there's a funny scene early on in the movie where Mannix is holding a meeting with various religious leaders of different faiths and denominations about a movie his studio is making ('Hail, Caesar!') and it's funny seeing how these leaders react to the premise of the movie. Actually, there's a line in the end credits of this movie which relates to this scene.Also making me laugh was a scene between Wraith Fiennes (as Laurence Laurentz) and Alden Ehrenreich (as Hobie Doyle). Presumably Hobie is meant to be Gene Autrey (I'm not sure because I don't think that I've ever seen an Autry movie). Tongue-in-cheek, the scene is about electrocution. By the by, speaking of knock-off characters, I'd say that Channing Tatum (as Burt Gurney) is meant to be Gene Kelly. The dance routine with Burt Gurney reminded me of a sketch on 'The late show' featuring Mick Molloy...demonstrating how anachronistic such fare is in the modern world (this clip might even be on You Tube).Since this was the era of senator Joe McCarthy, I have to say that I do find it a pity that the film's treatment of this era seems, if not fanciful, then at least insubstantial.My initial notes for this film gave it a score of 75% but a few days after seeing it now, I'll just dimish my score a tad...if I had of put '75%' in the header of this review, my practise is to round down my scores, not up, so the net effect is the same...this film gets 7 stars from me.",7,1,2,6 March 2016
Hancock," Intriguing superhero movie with an interesting twist
","Intriguing superhero story with a novel twist. Stars Will Smith as John Hancock, a derro and a wino who we learn has superpowers but despite this, he seems to have given up on life and is anti-social and even more unloved by the people of Los Angeles, for his careless destruction of property when doing 'good'.After accidentally bumping into Public Relations/marketing makeover wannabe Ray Embrey, played by Jason Bateman, John has the chance to attempt to re-invent himself as a hero the people can actually embrace. Charlize Theron also stars as Mary Embrey, Ray's wife. Charlize looks really beautiful in this movie...sort of like the blonde from ABBA (erm, the girl, obviously). It was only on reading the end credits that I realised that it was Theron...shows how much I know about pop culture!There is fun to be had in Smith's convincing depiction of a down and out superhero. Lots of good action scenes and humour that will appeal to both adults and children-whether through visual comedy or the banter.I like the fact that this movie is self-contained. It has an interesting mystery at its centre: who is John Hancock really and how come he has superpowers? We get answers to these questions, which is pleasing. Now, I mentioned that this movie has a novel twist. That's as far as superhero 'backstories' go. I don't think I've ever come across a superhero with Hancock's background in this kind of genre. When that background is revealed, you can either groan (for it being the kind of stuff you'd expect from the US) or just run with it. I did a bit of both, to tell you the truth. If this backstory interests you, I saw a vampire movie which goes down a similar path. From memory, that movie was 'Dracula 2000'. Saw it on free to air TV a few years back, a premiere, I think. Should say here that I watch and enjoy watching the TV series 'Heroes' despite finding the nature of their powers idiotic! So, if that TV show doesn't bug you, I don't see why Hancock's story would.There is an unexpected twist in this movie which I enjoyed, though, perhaps, it did have some continuity errors. Won't spoil the surprise for you though, perhaps, it did have some continuity errors.Unlike a lot of movies I give good scores to here, I think this could have repeat viewing value. 74/100. Hopefully there won't be a sequel. Wouldn't be interested in that unless Hancock gets some foes like him, but a bit 'anti'. In other words, it's hard to see a sequel with the same kind of villains being engaging. If the makers of this movie do go down the sequel route, they will hopefully rephrase the origins of Hancock's powers so that it isn't so cringe inducing.",7,0,2,16 July 2008
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A satisfactory conclusion to the series. 72.5%
","I'll just provide a brief impression of this movie, as it's the 3rd of 3, so if you've made it to this movie, you'll be familiar with the story so far.After a poor first movie, the second movie was quite good and where you'd expect a movie of this budget and background to be. The finale falls somewhere between the quality of the first two. I was considering giving this movie a simple 'Pass' score (as opposed to 'Fail'), but it's a bit better than that and my score of 72.5% is there or there abouts.One thing that is interesting about this series is that the first movie seems made for children but by the time of the final movie it is more adult in tone and themes. That would work for a young audience viewing these films as new releases but not so much if a young child was to view all three films in quick succession on disc or online. From memory, this final film has a shot of someone being beheaded.Positives about this film include:* Ryan Gage's performance as Alfrid. Gage is quite funny at times in this role. He puts into mind the very first series of Blackadder...he reminds me of that sitcom's titular character there...but funnier.* Moments of poignancy regarding characters and relationships.* Some of the large-scale battle scenes were well done. Some movies can't get this right, e.g. George Lucas' Star Wars movie 'Attack of the clones'. Director Peter Jackson did a magnificent job in this regard in the best movie of the 'Lord of the rings' trilogy, I think, in 'The two towers'. This isn't up to that standard, but it's good, nonetheless...has a touch of Saturday matineee swashbuckling to it, amidst the more sombre fighting scenes.Not exactly a negative, but when you first hear the voice of Dain, you immediately know who is playing him (perhaps...not all people would be familiar with him though). It makes you wonder if Tolkien's world had that actor in it!By the by:Watching the end credits, the sheer number of people is staggering, especially with specific crew titles. In one category I counted over 50 crew and in another category I couldn't keep up after I counted over 80 crew members in a particular category...there would have been around 90 or so there, I imagine.Lastly, I'll just say that the final film in this series does make it worth watching the series. That's a pointed comment to series like The Matrix, which starts off magnificently and goes nowhere fast from then on. 'The Hobbit' series started off as 'The Matrix' series finished but quickly established a reasonably good outcome.",7,3,8,11 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of the Sith a return to form for Lucas
","I was quite young when Episode IV came out, and I loved it for its excitement. Having within the last year or two rewatched the original series, these are my observations:IV is the best of the series. V is good, but the 'romantic' banter between Han Solo and Princess Leia was really bad. VI is OK, but it turns cheesy, and has a happy clappy, Caspar the friendly ghost type ending. The Ewoks were the most marketing/toy driven characters of the first trilogy.Episodes I-II Awful. Jar Jar Binks was a hopeless attempt at creating a new comedic character along the lines of R2D2 and C3PO. Lucas seemed to have gone crazy with CGI, especially with Attack of the Clowns. Sure, he had millions of CGI fighters, but the scenes were a MESS. Contrast that with the brilliantly done scenes in Lord of the Rings II. It too had millions of CGI fighters, but it worked brilliantly because you could see military strategy and tactics being utilised and creating tension.Revenge of the Sith-back to basics story telling-kept simple and easy to follow. Many analogies were drawn with today's 'war against terror', with Annakin aping some of Bush's 'arguments'.Anyway, sure there were some clunky and barely serviceable dialogue, but the story was good enough. Maybe Annakin's venture to the dark side could have been handled differently and better, but I liked the fact that he made his decision impulsively.What I'd like to see...now that Lucas has done a Star Wars worthy sequel, I'd like to see him REDO episodes I-II!!",7,3,5,24 May 2005
Inception," Intriguing tale...multiple interpretations possible, maybe. 75/100
","Perhaps the most recent ancestor to this movie that I can come up with is 'The 13th floor' which I really enjoyed...probably more than this movie. Whilst 'Inception' is entertaining and has thrills, it also is very long. Don't go into the cinema with the idea that you may want to go to the toilet, but will refrain...you'll regret doing so. It's the length of this movie which may diminish its 'repeat' viewing value...at the moment I think I 'get' the movie, so don't feel the need to revisit it in order to 'nut it out', like I did with 'The sixth sense'.Anyway, the plot concerns a criminal - Cobb (played by Leonardo Di Caprio)- who has the ability to steal secrets from people when they are dreaming...or to plant ideas in their head when they are dreaming. He needs accomplices to do this and access to the victim. There are some nice details in the movie about the mechanics of this ability...Cobb allows the victim's mind to furnish his deception with its own detail, making the crime virtually undetectable. Cobb's ability is called 'inception' and he targets people who have valuable secrets or whose actions can earn him a big payday by those willing to influence the victim via his inception.The movie may be confusing to viewers...Cobb wants to up the ante in his activities in order to better the chances of success against his victims. That means dreams within dreams. And dreams within dreams within dreams. Watching the movie I did feel that I understood what I was watching, but sometimes I wondered if I had been lead astray...i.e. it struck me that what was in a dream might actually be real...but my initial interpretation was right. Some may be lead astray right from the start! That's assuming I haven't been!Anyway, I'm just wondering if I have interpreted the movie correctly...on the surface level, Cobb seems to have an unsuccessful attempt at inception. Which leads him to be vulnerable to blackmail. Like the amount of dream layers in this movie (3), I can see 3 possible victims/targets in this movie...one of them - the initial intended victim at inception - was a ruse. I.e. not a failure at all. Which would make Cobb a willing victim of his own powers, perhaps. The surface interpretation is just the literal outcome of the movie...failed inception at the start, blackmail and then alternative job done for the initial victim.In short, depending on how you interpret the movie, the ultimate 'victim' is either Cobb, Saito or Robert Fischer. Depending on who you think the 'real' victim is, the events of the movie change in meaning. Another way of saying this is that it might be plausible to view the entire movie as being a dream...having dreams within it...or you may want to pick out one of these elements as being grounded in reality...which is where the endless debate on this matter comes in...everyone may have their own theory on what is real in this movie and what is a dream.",7,2,4,4 August 2010
Prometheus," Raises more questions than it answers. 72.5+%
","This movie will no doubt particularly interest fanboys of Ridley Scott's movie 'Alien' who wondered who (or what) the space jockey was in that first sci-fi horror movie. The end of Prometheus visually matches what the crew of the spaceship Nostromo in 'Alien' discovered on their 'rescue' mission to that alien planet...except - it seems to me - the space jockey is not where he should be! I.e. he is not in the same place we first saw him in 'Alien'!Scott's new movie acts as a prequel of sorts, to 'Alien' and I can imagine it having a sequel which coincides in timeframe to the journey of the Nostromo to the alien planet...but with different characters to that in 'Alien'. In any case, this prequel addresses mankind's big questions (like 'Where did we come from?') and posits up some answers. Fortunately - or unfortunately, depending on your perspective - Scott allows for some mystery to what he reveals, leaving it up to the viewer to critique the coherence of the narrative, or to pose further questions about story.The opening of the movie is just one of those moments where the viewer must ponder what it all means. In any case - as the movie's commercials reveal - mankind has discovered that Earth seems to have been visited by advanced aliens millennia ago...and mankind thinks returning the favour would be a good idea. Uh oh!Some of the tropes from the first movie are recycled in this movie...character types, visual imagery, etc. (in fact, some of the visual tropes even echo material in a TV series like 'The X-Files'...however, this new introduction to the lore of this franchise is either confused or confusing). I can't say that I found this movie scary as such, although some of the horror is visceral, it is not beyond the pale, so those seeking a gore-fest should look elsewhere. One thing which detracts from genuine chills in the movie is just the sheer stupidity of the crew of the spaceship Prometheus. Did they get their 'Occupational Health & Safety' credentials out of box of cornflakes? They're as stupid as horny teenagers in a slasher movie! Personally, I would have found it much scarier if the monsters in this movie had enough rat cunning to find their way to our crew despite their best defences...or just the use of brute force/sheer numbers to outsmart our best and brightest. But, like I say, our 'best and brighest' are stupid enough to drive the narrative to its conclusion. With all the 'big' ideas in this movie, some subtlety to the horror and danger would have been appreciated.Random aside...I was wondering where a certain Australian actor was...and reading the end credits, I can now see why the old man in this movie looked to be the result of prosthetic makeup.Also, look out for the final line of the end credits...it's a bit of a joke which is intended to 'explain' perhaps, why we can see this movie...sort of a 'found' footage narrative device, a la 'The Blair witch project'.Not a bad movie. Interesting aspects to it. Just nothing special. A sequel might be interesting...at the risk of giving a detailed 'explanation' for where we came from...which might be risible...or obscurantist.",7,0,5,12 June 2012
Halloween," A classic of the 'slasher' genre
","'Halloween' is one of those horror/slasher movies that parents of young children don't like them to watch. Surprisingly, however, this movie is not a gore-fest and for that reason may disappoint hardcore slasher fans.What it does have going for it is a scary central character, Michael Myers (no, not the guy from 'Wayne's World'!) and a highly effective, creepy soundtrack composed by the director, John Carpenter. In fact, years ago, I had considered buying the soundtrack to this movie but thought it could wait as it would always be around...silly me! Hopefully the new Rob Zombie version will recycle the original score and be out on soundtrack too.The plot is pretty simple-during Halloween, a young boy, wearing a mask, murders his sexually active sister. Years later, on the same day, that boy, Michael Myers (now an adult), has escaped a mental institution and returns home...with more of the same kind of mayhem in mind.This movie was directed by John Carpenter and is perhaps his best movie. From memory, it's stated in media that this movie was once the most successful independent movie of all time (since surpassed by Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11', I think).Jamie Lee Curtis has her first, at least major role, in this movie I think, as a would be victim of Myers. She is an effective screamer, as was her mother, Janet Leigh, in perhaps the first slasher movie, Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho'.Not sure, but Halloween may have been the inspiration for the subsequent spate of horror/slasher films that followed, many of them having an impossibly difficult to kill psycho at their centre, as in 'Friday the 13th' (parts I to xy).Anyway, despite the dark, gloomy, murky chills this movie provides, there are moments of fun, as when Myers dons a rather bad Halloween outfit, which creates an absurd look for him.You might want to check out this movie's first sequel, which I really liked, as well as other Carpenter films, including: 'The Thing' and, for fans of the PS 2 game 'Metal Gear Solid', check out Carpenter's 'Escape from New York' for influence.",Null,0,1,19 June 2008
Taken 2," Best to quit while they're ahead...67.5%
","I remember quite liking the first 'Taken' so I did have an interest in seeing the sequel. The law of diminishing returns is kicking in though now...and there might just be scope for at least two sequels given the events of this movie.Anyway, the plot concerns the father of one of the slain people traffickers of the first movie seeking revenge for the carnage caused by ex C.I.A. officer Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), who was ruthless in rescuing his daughter from a terrible fate in the first movie. The tables are somewhat turned in the sequel.The first act of the movie is a rather lengthy depiction of a lot of nice people (Bryan, his ex-wife and their daughter)...which basically establishes that they don't deserve what is about to befall them and to justify the further actions Bryan will be forced to undertake (pun intended).Seeing Bryan's old work buddies in this movie reminded me that they were in the first movie too...gosh, they must have had about two minutes worth of screen time for both movies! They're little more than plot devices in any case, which is overstating things!One is reminded of the Death Wish movie franchise...in that series, the vigilante was forever avenging the murders of those closest to him...eventually he must surely have been avenging the grocer he shops at, right? Which is to say I wonder how many criminals Bryan can tick off to provide fodder for this series...and whether revisiting the premise will prove entertaining at all or just ridiculous.I could have sworn I reviewed the first Taken here, but don't see it.",7,2,4,15 October 2012
Mary and Max," Grungey odd-couple comedy/drama...but how true is it?
","This is a hard movie to rate. I do remember seeing posters, I think,  which stated that this movie was based on a true story. That wasn't  enough to make me want to watch this movie. So, when the TV show 'At  the movies' reviewed it, and I saw some funny things, I decided to  watch it.  Watching this claymation movie, I had forgotten about the claims to  truth of this movie, which made me think that this was a very strange  movie indeed. It concerns the titular characters: Mary (voiced by  Bethany Whitmore for the child, and by 'The sixth sense''s Toni  Collette for the adult), a young Australian girl, and Max, an  American middle-aged man (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Feeling  bored one day, Mary randomly picks a name out of a phone book and  writes to them...which is how she sends Max a letter. The movie airs  the contents of their letters over many years, and displays each  character's psychological state. Barry Humphries provides the narration  in the movie. That element doesn't work particularly well in this  movie, I don't think, as the story-book format can drag at times.  The clip I saw on 'At the movies' was indicative of the quality of the  film...there are some genuinely funny exchanges between Mary and  Max...laugh out loud funny at times. However, forgetting that this  movie was supposedly based on a true story, I would think that the  content of the movie was very odd. It was quite dark at times. For that  reason, I don't think that this movie is appropriate for pre-teen  children, even though it is made with claymation (plasticine figurines  which are moved and photoed, to create the illusion of life in cinema).  So, as I said, this movie is hard to rate. It is genuinely funny at  times, but sometimes gloomily overwrought, which pegs it back a little.  If this movie bares no relation to reality, then I'd give it 6/10. If  there truth to it, I'd give it a score closer to 7/10. Did read an  interview with the movie's maker, Adam Elliott, in a local suburban  paper where I live (The Monash Leader, 14/04/2009, i.e. ten days ago),  where Elliott admits that the movie is based on his penfriend-ship with  an American when he, Elliott, was a child. On that basis, the high  melodrama that you see in this movie with Mary doesn't really seem to  be based on anything that Elliott himself experienced. On that basis  I'd mark this movie down a bit...it's gloom seems unmotivated. I'll  give it around 65/100.",7,6,37,23 April 2009
The Wolverine," Turning Japanese. 72.5+%
","I have to confess that I haven't been following this series (of franchises) religiously but returned to it for this instalment (this might be my first movie in the Wolverine's franchise). Generally I might watch the first in a franchise but stop after that one or the sequel (because they're 'meh'). Fortunately this movie doesn't have anything as silly as a mutant with a gene which affects the weather (!!).Anyway, in this movie you get to see the title character's back story, as far as his pre-present-day existence...i.e. his time fighting in World War II (at least in the Wolverine's flashbacks or nightmares). An important relationship in this movie is shown in that back story which will lead the Wolverine to return to Japan (where he fought in World War 2) in order to meet the Japanese soldier he was imprisoned by back then.An interesting element of the plot concerns the offer to Wolverine to give up his invincibility in exchange for a mortal life.There are some good visuals in this movie (although the 3D option wasn't much of a positive...but I saw the movie on a smallish screen...but I doubt that by itself diminished the effect much) and the fight scene on the bullet train is one of the all time great action sequences, equivalent to the vehicle chases in 'Mad Max 2' or the car chase in 'For your eyes only' as far as exhilaration goes. The fight scene is visceral despite obviously being a computer generated effect.As for the cast, Tao Okamoto as the WWII Japanese soldier's granddaughter Mariko is elegant and beautiful in a Grace Kelly kind of way. Mariko's childhood friend Yukio (Rila Fukushima) puts a praying mantis to mind. Since the film is set in Japan, there are obviously a lot of Japanese names. Following or remembering who was who became an issue for me as a result (i.e. when names were dropped in conversation and that person wasn't there at the time).There are slow parts to the movie and I liked the incidental Japanese music which I sometimes noticed during these passages. There are also some good incidental jokes in this movie which I liked...e.g. the scene where the Wolverine is required to clean up for a meeting. Also liked the joke about the pool...although I'm sure I've heard the same joke in another movie...I just can't remember which!). Other times there are lots of fights between Wolverine and ninjas or Yakuza. I get the impression that I missed some back story provided in an earlier movie but it didn't detract too much...i.e. the topic which gives the Wolverine nightmares.Miscellaneous: <ul><li>The end credits have plenty of crew using Japanese script for their names.</li></ul><ul><li>I get the impression that the entire film was shot in Australia, in which case...I didn't notice that it wasn't in Japan! </li></ul><ul><li>As per usual(?) there are sequences from a forthcoming movie featuring at least Wolverine...another X-Men outing it looks like...and I haven't been following that franchise since very early on.</li></ul>",7,2,5,13 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The end? 77.5%
","This movie breaks Alfred Hitchock's maxim 'The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder' (it runs for 164 minutes but I did manage to avoid a 'pit stop' for its duration!). It doesn't quite reach the same heights of its predecessor ('The dark knight') where Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker catapulted that film to near greatness.In the final (?) instalment of this trilogy (?), the arrival of new villain Bane (played by Tom Hardy) provides a worthy adversary for Batman (played by Christian Bale). Bane's visual and aural aesthetic is very much like that of The Humungus (played by Kjell Nilsson) in the classic Australian movie 'Mad Max II'. One of my criticisms of this movie though is that it's often hard to decipher what he is actually saying! The plot concerns the psychopathic plan of Bane to bring the city of Gotham to its knees as well as to destroy its icon, Batman. There are many references in this movie to story elements from the first in this trilogy ('Batman begins'). Since I haven't seen that movie or its sequel since their cinema releases, I have to say that most of this lore went over my head...so, some reminders in the movie would have been appreciated.Oddly, for most of its running time The Dark Knight Rises doesn't really come across as a superhero movie...it's a busy dramatic movie in any case and leaves one slightly befuddled as to who some of these characters are and why they are important to the story.Despite this, there are some nice twists and surprises in store for the follower of this franchise. It's not particularly funny, but I did get a laugh out of the performance of a 'judge' in this movie and Buckley's choice given to Commissioner Gordon by the 'judge'.There is one particularly cliché moment in this movie...when Bruce Wayne gets his own - dare I say it? - push-up and chin-up montage...well, near enough to such a montage.One distraction for me was the actress playing Selina Kyle/Catwoman. She looked familiar and I was thinking it might have been Penélope Cruz or Salma Hayek. Turns out it was Anne Hathaway...obviously I haven't seen her in a movie for a while! In any case, she's a minor character who makes her presence felt and appreciated.A related criticism of this movie...well, it's the same one, again...later in the movie one character, Miranda Tate (played by Marion Cotillard), has some important dialogue, but, once again, I found it hard to decipher what she was saying. In this case the issue was her heavily accented English. It is a charming accent...just a wee bit hard to understand though.I'm not sure what to think of the ending. It's intriguing. If the franchise does continue, it makes me wonder what the story of Batman will be and what his true identity is.In conclusion, this is a solid, if long and serious superhero movie. It didn't engross me though, although it did entertain and interest. There are elements of class warfare to the story. To me, that seemed to boil down in the movie to Buckley's choice: a world where the super-rich live in shiny castles and the poor lead their bleak existences, or one in which the rubble is shared by everybody. Seems like a false dichotomy to me.",8,1,4,31 July 2012
Iron Man," Enjoyable, but won't have repeat viewing value
","This is the brazilianth superhero movie to come out the US in the last picosecond. And it's not too bad, but, like with most of them, I doubt I will be as willing to see any subsequent sequels.In its favour is the performance of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man. The movie is basically boot-camp for people unfamiliar with the titular hero. In other words, you get the genesis of the character 'Iron Man'. Stark, as played by Bob Downey is smug, but fortunately comes with a dry sense of humour. Stark is a brazilianaire who inherited his fortune from his military industrialist father. Utilising his own scientific brilliance, Tony Stark has carried on in his father's footsteps and is now the supplier of choice for the US military.His Personal Assistant is Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Quirky name, but not in the same league as Pussy Galore, or Alotta Fagina. Paltrow provides her character with a degree of warmth...and coolth. She is reminiscent of some of Woody Allen's leading ladies at times, too, like Mia Farrow or Diane Keaton.Anyway, the story is basically about how Tony has a crisis of conscience after he gets a taste of his own medicine, arms wise, in the Middle East. Generic Middle Eastern terrorists are one of the main bad guys in this film.In a way this is an American fantasy about itself. In Hollywood movies like this, America plays the hero in the Middle East and Americans care a lot about not inflicting civilian casualties. This is ably demonstrated by Iron Man in one scene where the phrase 'surgical strike' is not pure spin.A theme of this movie is the struggle between the individual conscience and that of society or bodies like the military/Pentagon. Stark has a foot in both camps and thus sometimes mud will stick where you least expect it to.As I was just about to leave the theatre, after the end credits, an extra scene appeared, hinting at the nature of the sequel. Dunno if I'll see it.7/10",7,2,4,30 May 2008
Casino Royale," Classic 'Classic' Bond...87.5/100
","22nd of 23 Bond movies (21st of 22 official Bond movies) Daniel Craig makes his debut as James Bond, agent 007. In fact, this movie starts the franchise from scratch...it's actually a prequel...to a time before when James Bond actually had a licence to kill. The odd mixture of new elements and returning elements make it exist in a twilight zone world, like all the other Bond movies. By that I mean it's impossible to view all of the Bond movies and find coherence in them. This movie shows solidarity with the Brosnan era Bond (by the presence of a female M) and with the unofficial Sean Connery as Bond movie 'Never say never again' (by the presence of a black Felix Leiter).Anyway, Craig makes for a serious Bond and the absence of Q and Moneypenny in this debut is a promising start...I felt that by Dalton's time as Bond, the balance between seriousness and lightness was too much in favour of the latter, especially by the presence of Q and his gadgets. This is back to basics Bond, and it is done in a modern style, surpassing Connery's first forays with this character.I'm giving this movie 87.5/100. Just deducting a little bit from it for two reasons...one: it's a long movie; two: there is a great deal of focus on the game of poker here. Personally, I enjoyed this, but for people who are bored silly by this game or just don't understand it, I'm sure they could find it terminally dull for long stretches.Exotic locations: Czech Republic (thus placing the restart of this franchise in a post-Cold War era), Uganda, Madagascar, Bahamas, USA, Venice in Italy.Plot: MI6 is trying to find out how a network of terrorist groups is financed. A person by the name of Le Chiffre is central to this...he acts as a reliable banker to 'freedom fighters' (i.e. dictators and the like). When Le Chiffre proves less than reliable, he quickly needs to recover the money he lost, lest he be pursued by disgruntled African dictators. To that end, he organises a high-stakes no-limit poker game...with the hope of winning it himself (sounds foolproof, right?). Bonds spots an opportunity to mess things up for him...if he knock Le Chiffre out of the game, he may leave Le Chiffre with no option but to seek sanctuary with MI6...in exchange for information on the organisation that MI6 is so ignorant of...his own.Franchise clichés: Pre-title sequence - Black and white MGM lion; black and white Columbia animation. The action proper is black and white too. Odd, because the action takes place after the time frame of most Bond movies, although it does serve to hark back to the 'classic' era of movies...even though no Bond movie was ever in black and white! Anyway, this action shows how Bond acquires his '00' status and defines what actually constitutes '00' status as well. You then get the iconic gun barrel sequence, which, for the first time ever, is tied to the action proper. A nice touch.Theme song - 'You know my name' by Chris Cornell and David Arnold. Cornell sings. Has a retro feel to it...sort of like a Rat Pack kind of song (perhaps). The accompanying visuals are unique to the franchise and interesting. You also hear the famous Bond theme at the end of the movie...since you associate that with the agent licenced to kill, it would perhaps be inappropriate to play it at the start of the movie...before he has actually earned that status. Q - As with 'Dr. No' - the first official Bond movie - there is no appearance by this character. I really hope that Craig's time is marked by the absence of this character...give him a bit of a rest and reinvigorate the franchise.M - Another odd casting choice...Judi Dench continues in the role from the preceeding Bond, Pierce Brosnan. It doesn't really make sense as far as the franchise as a whole goes, but if you forget that, it's fine. Some nice exchanges with Bond, including: M - 'Bond, this maybe too much for a blunt instrument to understand but arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand'...Bond - 'So you want me to be half monk, half hit-man?'. An element of this movie is M's lack of trust of Bond and his methods.Moneypenny - Another welcome absence from the franchise. The only time they were remotely interesting was in Lazenby's and Brosnan's time as Bond. However, there is a neat allusion to her: Vesper - 'I'm the money'...Bond - 'Every penny of it'.Silly female character names - Vesper. Bond remarks on it. Her relationship with Bond is one of the superior ones of the franchise...I like their cat and mouse ways with each other. A noteworthy relationship for Bond, as far as character and dialogue go...almost up there with Lazenby's Bond and Tracy di Vicenzo.Sexism/misogyny - Can't say that I noticed any. That seemed to end with Roger Moore's reign as Bond, I believe.Wine buffery - Interestingly, when he orders a 'vodka martini' and the waiter asks him 'shaken or stirred?', you could knock me over with a feather if Bond doesn't say 'Do I look like I give a damn?'! Another line for the buffs...Bond says - 'A dry martini. Wait. Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet, shake it over ice, and then add a thin slice of lemon peel'. Did you get that? Would sir like a parasol on that? Yeah...I'll just have what he's having! Hmm...on reflection, I'm not sure that he wouldn't give a damn about whether his vodka martini was stirred or shaken. The lemon peel has an interesting name...one that Bond gives to it. No clues!",9,0,2,6 October 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," Humour, pathos, reality. 100%
","An amusing and entertaining account of the protracted efforts of Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) to acquire the film rights to the novel 'Mary Poppins', by Pamela (Mrs!) Travers (played by Emma Thompson. The reasons why his efforts are so protracted become evident throughout the movie.Firstly, I have to confess to never having seen the movie nor read the book. Truth be told, it took me ages to work out who the titular character was! Now that I have the seen this movie, exploring the source material and more seems worthwhile.'Protracted'wellMrs. Travers sort of comes across as a female version of Basil Fawlty in this movie (of the famous U.K. sitcom 'Fawlty Towers')! She is brusque and has the manner of a stern, toffee English woman. Mrs. Travers is consistently and insistently brusque throughout the movie and most amusing for that. That being said, seeing as how 'Fawlty Towers' never found favour in the U.S., it might be hard to picture American audiences being much amused by her. There is some nice, subtle humour in the performances of those Mrs. Travers has to work with in the moviethe would be song writers for the film 'Mary Poppins'I recognised one from the U.S. version of 'The office' (B.J. Novak).If Mrs. Travers was nothing more than a female Basil Fawlty, then I suppose I might not have enjoyed this movie so much. Thompson, however, brings a great sense of pathos to her role. She is a woman who miserably carries her cross with her all the time. Not having read her book, I wonder how much of a 'disconnect' there is between the author and her creation. Having seen a few award bait movies recently, I can't say that any have particularly grabbed me. As Travers does have a narrative arc or sorts and displays multi-dimensional emotions, I think Thompson deserves a Best Actress award. The recently held Golden Globe awards gave that honour to actresses in 'American hustle', but to me 'Saving Mr. Banks' is the superior movie and Thompson a more deserving recipient (I have no idea if Thomspon was even nominated in those awards).Tom Hanks is also recognisably Tom Hanks in this movie, but it didn't detract from his performance. Seeing as how positively I responded to this movie, I would be generous in giving him a Best Actor award. Seeing as how this movie is made by Walt Disney Studios, it's no surprise that his representation is imbued with a vaseline glow. I was trying to recall what the controversy was with him, so I looked him up on Wikipedia to see if it was mentioned thereit isanti-Semitism and racism. Of course, I doubt if a movie of this sort would really have any business delving into that aspect of his character.What is good about this movie is how it attempts to ground Mrs. Travers personality with her childhood experiences. To me, it seemed to provide a basic level of insight into her, which wasn't harsh. Without having explored this aspect myself, it seems to me that the film does provide some sort of explanation for the relationship between her book and her childhood experiences. Perhaps I would have liked more insight into the relationship between her childhood experiences and the woman she becamethey seem pretty tenuous in the film, but then again I'm not sure psychonalysis would be of much help here. It's just my sneaking suspicion that there is more to her adult form than what we see in the movie. This aspect is intriguing to me.If I do have one criticism of the film, it is that it appears quite obscure on her family's story. It wasn't clear to me what Mrs. Travers' father did for a living before he moved his family to the middle of nowhere in Australia. Did he have to change jobs? Also, there is a scene with Mrs. Travers' mum (when she is also a child) where her mum pockets some liquor at the clothesline. Was that drink for her? Or was she hiding it from her husband? More clarity would have been appreciated here.There was one scene which I appreciated in this movieafter a moment of crisis between Mrs. Travers and Walt, Walt travels to England to see her. He connects with her on a human level, I felt, and displayed empathy with her. The less pleasant scene (although it is played for laughs) comes later, when Mrs. Travers returns to see Walt, unexpectedly. It seems an affirmation of what Mrs. Travers might have imagined their relationship to have been all alongmerely mercantile (on his part).This movie portrays Mrs. Travers as having her D.N.A. (so to speak) all over Walt's movie. Since the movie is regarded as a classic, it seems her efforts were entirely positive and beneficial to Walt's movie, perhaps? In which case, she's hardly deserving the scorn that she draws at times, right? If she hadn't of been so insistent on her vision for the movie, would have it been as so unutterably awful as she imagined it could have been?On reflection, it also seems to me that Mrs. Travers is, in fact, a kind of unintentional heroine of this Disney movie. Recently my Duckduckgo (a search engine) app had an interesting news story feed on itvia the 'filmschoolrejects' website. The story was called '6 things the film industry does not want you to know about'. Number 6 concerned studios stealing scriptspoor script writers submit a script and an eerily similar one gets made into a movie later on with no compensation for the original script writer. I say 'Bravo!' to Mrs. Travers! A true hero!If the movie's script isn't just basically the conversations transcribed verbatim at the time from tapes, then I'd also give this film a best Script award. It's also my personal Best Film so far.",10,0,1,14 January 2014
Lucy," Silly but entertaining sci-fantasy. 70+%
","Some of the movies that 'Lucy' recalled for me included 'The matrix', 'Videodrome' (or other Cronenberg titles), '2001: a space odyssey' as well as, oddly, Aesop's fables (not a movie, but thematically). It's definitely a movie worth viewing but I don't think it really captures the imagination like the first 'The matrix', for example, nor does it get as trippy as the end of '2001'. The plot of the movie revolves around an American tourist - the titular character, played by Scarlett Johansson - who is duped into becoming a drug mule for a nasty Asian drug syndicate. Due to her being assaulted by one of the syndicate's goons, the drug is released into her body, giving her extraordinary powers. Lucy now has her chance to get revenge on the syndicate. On the level of a revenge movie, the movie also fails to deliver (as it did with its 'trippy' aspect).The high concept of the movie is the premise of: what would happen if humans could use more than 10% of their brain? Lucy creeps closer to a figure of 100%, as the screen constantly reminds you. Now, I'm not sure where the figure of '10%' is pulled from, but I'll be so bold as to predict that someone attaining 100% brain capacity will...not in any way resemble Lucy's personification of this feat! In other words, her abilities are somewhat implausible and the movie comes across as more science fantasy than sci-fi. However, I do get the impression that the movie mixes actual science facts (or provisional facts, if you will), with just pure, escapist fantasy.Performance wise, I found Scarlett's representation early on (pre-drug effects) to be a bit 'Laverne & Shirley' like...although I haven't actually seen that TV show...just brief clips. I.e. she seems sort of working class...Brooklyn (?). Like the movie, I didn't find that she created a sense of excitement for the concept. Morgan Freeman also plays a scientific expert. Again, his performance didn't really grab me. So, from my point of view, whilst Scarlett and Morgan being int he film helped to get it sold, I personally wouldn't have minded had the cast been complete unknowns. Morgan pretty much does what he's been doing for years in these kinds of roles...quietly oh so Morgan. I did enjoy the amusing performance of...- this site bills him as 'The limey'! - Julian Rhind-Tutt.The movie itself is jokey at times (as with 'The limey'), amusing, dark, violent and fantastic (as in hard to believe). At the start of my review, I mentioned 'Aesop's fables'. By that I mean that the frequent juxtaposition of shots of animals in the movie serve to provide a moral lesson for the bind that Lucy is about to find herself in. Some may be put off by this random juxtaposition of film.If I had any other issues with the logic of the movie, one might be the scene where Lucy meets her namesake. It made me think that perhaps the world that our Lucy lives in might have been changed by that meeting.Some interesting titbits from the end-credits:* Oddly, there is a 'Special thanks' to Monsieur Hulot! Guessing that the director doesn't take these things all to seriously!* I enjoyed the music at the end of the movie...was unsure if it was one song or me. I particularly like the song that plays last in the end credits. I thought that that might have been by Blur's Damian Alburn ('Sister Rust'), but it turns out to have been by Roary, with a song called 'God's whisper', which I'm not sure is even mentioned in the end credits. He's a new artist...not even on Wikipedia yet!As I say, it's an odd but interesting movie that is well worth seeing, but doesn't have a big pay off if you are after a 'straight' sci-fi movie, 'trip' movie or revenge movie. If you like screen violence/fighting/car chases etc., that's all there too. In fact, on reflection, the anti-climactic 'fight' scene with Lucy up against a bunch of syndicate goons is amusing for the way that it deflates boyish fantasies of revenge.",7,3,12,7 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The brand is strong with this one. 65%
","'Star Wars: The force awakens' could easily be retitled 'Star Wars: The next generation' because this long time coming sequel to the original trilogy introduces a new cast of characters, as well as some familiar ones. Providing a lot of fan service to those who've seen the original trilogy, those who see this new chapter in the franchise will find a lot of this fan service goes over their head if they haven't caught up with the original trilogy (a cynic might say that the movie is a rehash though). It seems pitched at a young audience at times ('cute' new robots etc.) but occasionally I'd say that the action is more suitable to young teenagers.I'll refrain from giving away too many details about this movie, apart from the basic plot concerning the search for Luke Skywalker (the hero of the original trilogy) in order to restore 'balance to the force'...or some such. Becoming a key player in the search for Luke is our heroine, young Rey (played by Daisy Ridley). She's not far from being this movie's analogue to Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy, as in it seems to be her journey that we will be following the most, although other new characters are a focus of this movie. Rey comes across as potentially a character to root for but I'm not convinced that the story or script has done Daisy any justice in accomplishing this.Towards the end of the movie, it was tracking to score 60% but I quite liked the last 30 odd minutes of this movie and so pushed my score up to 65%. You can tell from that score that this movie didn't really excite me that much. Maybe that is due to it being a recycling of story and references from the original movie? No, not that. Here's my biggest fault for this film: it's designed to push your buttons, to manipulate you into a state of euphoria...and fails. It's this failure which sees my score so low. In other words, I don't have a problem with movies trying to push your buttons or to manipulate you...but please, just be good at what you're trying to do!The brand is strong with this one, though, as worldwide box office receipts are showing. Maybe this movie could become the highest grossing movie of all time...or enter the top 5 or even top 3 spots. That it's having this impact speaks volumes for the work of George Lucas, whose first movie in this franchise ('Star Wars: A new hope', which is episode IV in the series!) created the 'Star Wars' brand, from nothing. If that film had bombed at the box office, we'd have heard no more of this space opera. Maybe I'm nostalgic for the original trilogy and this colours my views on the revival of this franchise by Disney Inc.? I doubt it. Ordinarily, I don't see movies more than once, but I have returned to the original trilogy more than I have for most other movies (from memory, I've seen the first ever Star Wars movie maybe about half a dozen times or so). To tell you the truth, the prequels to Star Wars I've only ever seen once. They were that mediocre. 'The force awakens' is roughly in the same league as the very last of the Star Wars prequels, and that was the only good one in that prequel trilogy. That being said, I can't imagine returning to this current movie. If this current movie repeats its founding movie's status as the highest grossing movie of all time, will it have the same repeat viewing value? THAT is the test of its worth, in my view. Lacks that, it does. Reminds me of those reports about blind taste test between various colas...when you know you're drinking Coke, you rate it the best, but when blindfolded, you prefer the taste of other colas...not even brand names, necessarily. I suspect that that's the case with this new Star Wars movie...the brand is selling it.The movie walks a tightrope between being ponderous (and therefore uninteresting) and intending to be euphoric with its action. Characters are 'hothoused' (like Rey) and not allowed to grow as characters over time. Other characters are foisted upon us with metaphorical cardboard signs around their necks, telling us how to relate to them. E.g. one X-wing fighter pilot is spotlighted as being 'the best pilot in the resistance'. As if we couldn't be SHOWN that. And what I did see wasn't that remarkable. There's a huge contrast between this tightrope balancing act when compared to the great TV shows of recent years...even shows which have no action to speak of, like Mad Men. Sure, nothing much thrilling happens, but it sure is engrossing. And even a great show like 'Dexter' had some characters remain static for years, only to suddenly evolve to great effect near the end of the series. It's a pity that Rey's evolution was fast tracked.Back to failing to push the right buttons...the fate of one character should have moved me but...no...I was indifferent to it.A very minor gripe...the cheesy dissolves between scenes in this movie.I saw this movie in 3D. Barely noticed the effect...except for a few stunning scenes which demonstrated vast scales. It's a pity that more couldn't have been done with this, e.g. exploring the huge battle cruisers.Speaking of failing to manipulate...the final scene didn't even rate as unintentionally funny, with that long, soapy gaze from an old character.On a positive note, the villain of this piece becomes interestingly complex in the last 30 odd minutes of this film, contributing to my higher score.Lastly, I'm surprised that the bad guys don't go broke in this galaxy...expensive infrastructure is a favourite of theirs!Disney's Neverending Story? I may lose interest in this franchise at some point then.",6,10,17,28 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A great ending after treading water in the last film...
","(Viewed in a megaplex in 3D...the 3D was unremarkable...I'm not sure if I would have been more impressed with iMax 3D.)After watching the first part to this finale, I felt that that movie was 'treading water', which put me in mind of The Matrix sequels...I also felt that The Matrix Reloaded was treading water...but that didn't put me off seeing the finale. When I did see the finale (The Matrix Revolutions), I was really let down by it...all the sequels seemed unwarranted in retrospect. Happy to say the final Harry Potter movie delivers a great story.Another analogy is also brought to mind...'Quantum of solace' (the direct sequel to 'Casino Royale'). In the case of the rebooted Bond franchise, the sequel (QoS) was asking too much of viewers if they had not seen the first movie in a timeframe where they wouldn't have forgotten half of the story. At the time QoS looked a badly edited and incoherent mess. It is a much better picture though when the first movie is fresh in your mind.Anyway, that's what's so great about this Harry Potter final instalment...even though I had not reacquainted myself with the Potter movies before seeing it, the movie was there to remind me of the story or provide strong hints at worst. It didn't feel like I was disorientated with the story...the movie was there to help me. It should be noted too that I have never read any of the books the movies are based on, and with the finale, it just nicely wraps up the movie version of the story, without making you feel like you need to be a complete Harry Potter geek to enjoy (a 'geek' as in having read all the books numerous times and having seen all the preceding movies...numerous times).Like I said, the first instalment of the finale felt like it was treading water. With final instalment, it is all action and forward momentum. It even strikes me as being the kind of movie that has repeat viewing value on its own (as in not requiring seeing the earlier films at all to enjoy...or perhaps just in case you are already familiar with the movies).Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 has made watching the series from the beginning 'worth it'. I can't remember what the other Potter movie I particularly enjoyed was called (the one with an element of time travel to it), but as much as I liked that (quite a bit), I'd say that the finale is in a league of its own, as far candidates for the best entry in the series goes (like the first Narnia movie). It's a great movie, full stop.Hmm...I wonder how far the Potter/Narnia/religious parallels go...",10,0,1,13 August 2011
The Matrix," A cool fantasy
","This is a movie that combines style with substance. It's basically a riff on the age old philosophy of Scepticism-a philosophy that holds that we can know nothing of the world we live in as it is all an illusion. The hero of this movie, Neo, finds himself in just such a predicament. He is told that the world he lives in is just an illusion, controlled by inhuman monsters. He is given a choice: accept the illusion, or break out of the illusion.You can't really say that the events in the movie are philosophically coherent or satisfying, but on a visceral and emotional level, it gives a tremendous thrill ride.The movie plays like every small boy,s fantasy-a chance to play a god-like being against other all powerful beings. The music adds to this macho, gun-toting, martial art practising fantasy. For example, a variation on Led Zeppelin's classic guitar riff song 'Kashmir' is used to great effect later on in the movie.This is a marvellously executed boys' own adventure. It was one of several entertaining movies from Hollywood in this period which dealt engagingly with profound philosophical issues. Rest assured, this is not a movie for the intellect only-it uses this old philosophical chest-nut in order to create an exciting, but scary world where apocalyptic battles are fought.Other movies of extreme interest from around this period include Dark City and The Thirteenth Floor. The latter is like The Matrix, but more so, if you get what my mean. The former deals with profound philosophical issues, but of a different sort.In a different vein, is Gattaca. All of these movies could be described as science-fiction/fantasy movies. See them to see a different world imagined.Lastly, The Matrix was so good, you would have hoped that it would have had sequels made. No such luck. Of course, it would have been so easy to make nothing sequels that reviewers would not want to acknowledge. Yup, the makers of The Matrix knew when to quit-after one movie. A monument.",10,0,1,3 June 2008
Looper," Too many ingredients in the narrative. 75%
","Not a bad time travel story concerning executioners known as 'loopers' who kill people sent back in time by criminals. The film is set in the future where, we are told, time travel has not yet been invented. Criminals in the 'loopers'' future need to 'dispose' of people from that future time by sending them back in time as people are so easily identified in the criminals' time that you can't have anonymous corpses then.Of course, the executioners are well compensated for their work. Their biggest payday is earned when they execute their future selves! That is know as 'closing the loop'. They then have 30 years in which to live it up before...they get sent back in time to be eliminated (in order to cover the tracks of their future criminal employers). This, of course, brings many time travel paradoxes into play.Whilst an interesting concept, the biggest drag on this movie is having another genre staple in the mix...telekinesis. Time travel is hard enough to get your head around but the addition of telekinesis strikes me as just naff. The movie could have been improved by tightening it (with the removal of that element). The characters aren't particularly engaging either and they're not sympathetic for the most part. One looper - Joe - is the subject of the movie. His younger self is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his older self is played by Bruce Willis (who has a superior time travel movie to his credit...'12 monkeys'...although his performance in that earlier movie wasn't what was good about it either). Perhaps another detracting element from the film is the logic of time travel...the scenario as I outlined above seems to contradict scientific understanding of the limits of time travel. That understanding was best illustrated in the more brain hurting movie 'Primer'. I've reviewed that movie here and commented on it requiring flowcharts and notes to keep tabs on what is happening. 'Looper' does pretend to be that complicated (Old Joe mentions the pitfalls of discussing time travel) but isn't. So, aside from seeming to portray an impossible form of time travel, it also seems to become incoherent in other ways too. When Joe has to 'close the loop' on one occasion, the movie does seem to lapse into 'Groundhog day' territory (a terrific comedy with some overlapping ideas) but then becomes confusing. I'm guessing that's because of bad story telling rather than any problems with the notion of time travel itself. That scene seems either inooherent or misleading. Anyway, I did like the ending to this movie...even though I'm not sure it followed its own internal logic of what time travel entails!Recommendations:12 monkeys Primer. You really do need a flowchart and a notepad to keep up! Groundhog day",7,1,6,10 October 2012
Deadpool," Another entertaining anti-superhero movie...
","Comic book hero movie franchises can often get off to a good, fun start, then peter out so badly that you lose interest in watching more sequels. 'Deadpool' has gotten off to a good start and hopefully being more anti-hero in genre will hold the (wannabe) franchise in good stead.Ryan Reynolds plays the titular anti-hero in this movie and you get to see - through fragmented and out of sequence story - how he came to have the extraordinary powers that he does. If I've seen any of Ryan's films before this one, I don't remember them...at least for him specifically. In that way, he's kind of an 'unknown' actor for me and I do like the way that the character of Deadpool is underplayed by him. As for how Deadpool came to have the powers that he does...I'm not so sure why he's so upset...given the alternative that he faced.With the vulgar and violent nature of Deadpool, it could have been easy to make him much larger than life...like Jim Carrey's performance as The Mask...or maybe demonstrate the kind of exuberance you see by the superhero in the first Spider-Man movie, starring Toby Maguire. As it stands - in this first movie, at least - Deadpool isn't as charismatic as one might have been lead to believe (I've never read any of the comics for that character. Apparently he had a small part in one of The Wolverine movies...if I saw him there, he meant nothing to me) and nowhere near as charismatic as Chloë Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl in the 'Kick-Ass' franchise. Again, this isn't a bad thing...at least not yet.The action scenes in the movie are well done...stylised and exciting...cf. the second Avengers movie where 'more' most definitely translated into 'less'. Also enjoyable was the humour in this movie...Deadpool doesn't take much seriously. If you have wide pop cultural knowledge, you can play 'Spot the reference'...e.g. there is a variation in this movie of an even longer Monty Python sketch which stretches the joke to breaking point. There's also a paraphrase of a famous quote from 'Notting Hill'. If you've seen 'American psycho' you might get a kick out of the discussion on the merits of 'Wham!'. It's hard to say if the anti- hero's tast in music is meant to humorous too...I suspect that it is! The humour of Deadpool also gets quite 'meta' at times...he refers to actors...who play characters in superhero movies...You do see other superheroes from the Marvel universe in this movie...I just have no idea who they are...but their super powers are...suitably silly. Some of the reviews that I read for this movie made it seem like it was particularly violent but I didn't find it particularly confronting. Some of the dialogue has sexual references, so, combining that with the violence, I'd say that this isn't a movie for the youngsters.The character of Deadpool reminds me a bit of the Tom Baker years as The Doctor, in 'Doctor Who'...but more violent. Have to say that I'm more a fan of these anti-superhero type movies than the more conventional kinds...so, I like Deadpool...as well as Watchmen, Kick- Ass and Hancock.",8,3,14,28 February 2016
Cube," Mysterious but intriguing thriller
","'Cube' is an odd little movie which you could describe as a 'high concept' film. In other words, it was probably made on the strength of a pitch which went something like this: 'Seven people awaken and find themselves inexplicably trapped inside of a giant cube. They have to navigate there way to the outside, but find many compartments to be death traps. Who will make it out, alive, from THE CUBE?!'. Sound interesting? Perhaps you could view this thriller as an inverse scenario to the classic horror movie 'Hellraiser' which I've also reviewed at this site.Anyway, this movie fortunately gives a wide berth to any humbug about the nature of the cube these seven people find themselves in. If it had gone down that direction, I'm sure it would have been laughable, but you can imagine your own scenariossomething of a scenario like in the 'Saw' franchise of splatter movies? Another possibility is hinted at when the film ends, which I won't go into, to let you come to your own conclusions. All very mysterious, which is as it should be for this kind of stuff.Since I've given this film a score of around 6/10 (and I'm going on memory to rate this film), why should you see it? Well, it has the most aesthetically pleasing scene of human butchery I've ever seen. Hmmmsounds badwell, it's not really that bad. Right at the start of the movie, there is a scene which is sort of realistic and sort of cartoony, which provides the 'Wow!!' factor. And if Windows' 'Vista' made you say 'Wow!', you really should get out more! So, 6/10 for a wondrous death scene that will have you reaching for the 'freeze frame', 'frame by frame' or 'slow motion' buttons on your remote! Intriguing movie.",6,0,1,4 July 2008
Incredibles 2," Incredibles 2 (D) - Mature, adult animation. 65%
","This must be quite a belated sequel and I saw it because I remember really liking the first film, whenever it was released, even though I went into that not having any great expectations for it, seeing as I took it be a 'children's film'. Even though I remember very little of that first film, due to having only seen it during its original cinema release, I would say that I found it very entertaining and probably quite funny. If I had been scoring films here back then, I would guess that it might have gotten a score of around at least 80%, if not 90%. Perhaps due to the sequel seeming to be of a different nature to the original, my score might be quite harsh. I was planning on scoring it at a perhaps generous 60%, but have bumped up my score. If you're expecting a film pitched at a young audience, you might also be similarly harsh in your views on this film, but if you view it from the perspective of being like an animated Marvel or X-Men film, you might fare better. Humour isn't really this sequel's thing though, as I did find it quite 'serious'. Anyway, the plot concerns 'The Incredibles' family, a family of superheroes, living in a world where superheroes are now criminalised. A technology tycoon gives the family an opportunity to try and overturn these laws through public relations. Some of the themes raised in this film include the notion of 'just' and 'unjust' laws, as well as what it is right to do in the case of the latter. The notion of pop culture as reducing the experience of humanity is also touched upon, briefly. Perhaps you could also interpret the film as dealing with post-11/09/2001 issues as well.  As I say, the film doesn't seem pitched at a young audience and it probably isn't suited to children who aren't mature. There's scenes of destruction, not too far removed from visions of September 11, 2001, especially early on. Death is alluded to as well and in a sign of the film's 'mature' orientation, Mr. and Mrs. Incredible have marital tensions to deal with, such as how gender roles define them, for better or for worse. I saw the film in 2D and I'm not sure how worthwhile it would be to see the film in 3D. It did occur to me watching the end credits that the film may have been released in 3D, and later end credits did confirm to me that that was indeed the case. Visually, the film does dabble in realism, as far as outdoor scenes go, with the human characters usually looking caricatured, although occasionally realistic. Even though I didn't find the film particularly funny, I'd say that it was funnier than 'Avengers: Infinity war' (which isn't saying much...at all). Like I say, I see this film as more akin to an animated Avengers or X-Men film...but probably better than most of those. I'd be curious to see the first Incredibles film again, to see if it was quite funny and more entertaining (as opposed to 'serious', like its sequel).Random observations:* Musically, there seems to be some nods and winks to the James Bond films and the film 'Shaft'.* Maybe the music and perhaps the end credits as well have a touch of 1960s and 1970s era films to them, including the visual style of the end credits.",6,1,4,22 June 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," Superior comedy horror movie. 85%
","If you're after a horror movie, this probably isn't for you. It's way too arch for that. The genre is mercilessly battered to a pulp in this movie. So, if you enjoyed movies like 'Scream' or 'Evil dead II', this will be just the ticket for you! Might I also recommend 'In the mouth of madness' as a good example of a postmodern horror movie?Anyway, seeing this movie's title might lead you to have certain expectations as to what it's like. These are met...but with a twist. Even the opening scene is a spanner in the works...people in lab coats or whatnot. So, basically, you get two different settings...the young adults in that cabin in the woods, and some mysterious people in a high tech facility who are in some way connected to their fates.The movie does meet certain horror movie clichés...gore happens, as does a sex scene where you get to see boobies and everything!!Anyway, where this movie sets itself apart from its brethren is the whole 'high tech facility' component to its story. The workers there function - you could say - as a Greek chorus on what transpires in that cabin...which is in the woods (for those who weren't concentrating!). Perhaps they could also be stand-ins for the kind of people who make horror movies...the ones parodied in this movie. In any case, they provide a meta-narrative for the genre as a whole...or a meta-explanation for the raison d'être of the world depicted in any such horror movie. If you think horror movies are just an excuse for the ritual sacrifice of pretty young things, well, this film has something to say on this.If I do have some quibbles with this movie, they are minor...like the mysterious guy you see as the pretty young things leave in their van for that cabin...which is in the woods. He seems pretty redundant. There's also a scene which I think overplays the whole 'high tech' aspect to the story...I'd like to pretend that the horror story could be real (!) but the bit with the eagle near the start of the movie just made me think that this was set in some alternative universe. Lastly, you see a name actor near the end of the movie. It's entirely self-conscious...the acting and the use of the actor.As Joss Whedon is a major player in the making of this movie, you do expect a lot of liberties to be taken with genre forms. Fortunately he delivers. The dialogue and situations are frequently funny and the performances are engaging. And it is so whilst picking at the scab of the genre's conventions.For some reason I thought that Fran Kranz had an Owen Wilson vibe to his look/performance. He plays the stoner 'Marty'. I like how his comments in the van at the start of the movie bookend with what happens at the end of the movie. Anna Hutchison (as 'Jules') has a 'That's just wrong!' scene...she's quite the foxey lady though! I did get a laugh out of the comments concerning the outcome in Japan. My pop cultural references didn't extend to knowing the deal with the Sugar Plum Fairy. Must have missed that episode.Anyway, I think this is a funny movie with repeat viewing potential. I missed the start of it and watched the start of the next session to catch up on it...some of it still made me laugh.",8,1,5,30 June 2012
Spectre," An average Bond movie but worth it for the backstory and lore. 75%
","Possibly Daniel Craig's last outing as English superspy James Bond, this movie sees our hero confronting a mysterious organisation with corrupt roots which spread deeper in society than anyone knows, let alone suspects.The cinematography in the film often has visual cues to previous Bond films, be they 'Live and let die', 'From Russia with love' and no doubt many others too.Whilst no element of this film stands out, there is some situational and character based humour which lightens to the tone, somewhat. That being said, the violence in this movie can be quite confronting, putting in mind the phrase 'Be careful what you wish for', as scenes that would otherwise play out like 'Classic' era Bond movies begin to push the envelope until it makes you squirm uncomfortably. Which reminds me...another point of comparison for this film: 'Licence to kill', due to this strong violence.,,but it's not as extreme as that earlier Bond movie.Speaking of 'Classic' era Bond movies...'SPECTRE' is indeed a throwback to those early Connery movies, like 'From Russia with love', as far as tone and pacing goes. For the Connery movies, this was a negative to me, as he wasn't of my era and this approach dated those early movies for me. However, the more modern sensibility of Craig's Bond films makes this approach more tolerable, if not entertaining.Despite being escapist entertainment, my rational brain did resist the film's logic, especially early on. E.g. the helicopter fight scene...this didn't strike me as believable and I did wonder if Bond had missed some important OH&S seminars at HQ! Apart from the escapist aspect of this film, it does broach contemporary concerns in a more serious manner, for example, contemporary politics and the surveillance police state.After viewing this movie I was thinking of scoring it 70% but that would put it pretty low on my list of Bond movies (see my List on this site for my ranking of the Bond movies), so I upped my score (relative to other Bond movies only) to reflect the fact that I found this movie more enjoyable due to it having a more 'modern' character as well as for being good fan service as far as James Bond's backstory goes as well as the lore associated with the franchise.Daniel Craig's series of Bond movies are probably the ideal way for someone new to this franchise to enter the Bond world and that includes this movie too. You get more of Bond's backstory here as well as that of characters and organisations which were a staple of the 'Classic' era of Bond movies, i.e. starting with Sean Connery's Bond. At least Craig's Bond movies have an air of coherence to them, which the earlier ones don't, really, unless you have a photographic memory.By the by, the Herald Sun's 'Hit' lift-out reviewed this movie and also included some factoids about it. Personally, I find it hard to believe that this film was so expensive to make. There's also the factoid that the movie made the Guinness Book of world records for the biggest ever film explosion, utilising 8,418 litres of fuel and 33 kg of explosives. Also, the film just made me look up 'dirty Martini'...not a variation on the dirty Sanchez (fortunately!), but a cocktail which features olive product.Lastly, whatever Daniel Craig decides to do with his career, the end credits of 'SPECTRE' assures us that 'James Bond will return'!",7,0,4,8 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Apocalyptic, surreal, exhilarating. 82.5%
","As with Mad Max 2, this latest instalment of the Mad Max franchise presupposes no prior knowledge of the preceding movies. The term 'reboot' has been applied to it, which is perhaps fair enough. Having a new star as the titular character (Tom Hardy) lends credence to this view. As with Mad Max 2, Fury Road begins with a voice-over narration setting the scene. In Mad Max 2, that voice was some nameless man, acting as a teller of the myth of Max. In Fury Road, it is the voice of Max himself. Mad Max 2 struck me as more mythic, but Fury Road does not eschew this approach but it does appropriates other stylistic genres. Perhaps the driver of this story is a variation on the story of The Iliad...all Hell breaks loose when the wife of a powerful man goes walkabout...off the reservation, so to speak. There seems to be more emphasis on a picture of a post-apocalyptic society here than in previous Mad Max films, although perhaps Beyond Thunderdome did delve in to this aspect...it's just that I remember very little of of it, apart from that cage-fight setting etc. Early on in the film, at least, it's more about creating a sense of place and society than focusing on Max. Most of the movie is one long, frantic, car/truck/motorcycle chase sequence...which might sound like a bad thing but director George Miller makes it exhilarating...although perhaps falling short of the standards he set in Mad Max 2...which happened to be my introduction to the franchise and made me conclude as a child that he had outdone Hollywood (later watching the first film in the series was a disappointment, I have to say). How does Tom Hardy fare in the role? In this, he seems a marginal character a lot of the time...an accidental/incidental hero, if you will...low intensity often, too. He looks buff compared to the lithe Mel Gibson in the first three movies. His accent seems a bit weird too...I can't remember if I found it to sound South African at times...or maybe that was one or two other characters? Some of the other characters have weird accents too...either they're not nailing what they're going for, or it's just a mixed bag of accents. Max's costume accessories at times recall his role in The Dark Knight Rises. Sometimes Max's predicament puts in mind Daniel Craig's James Bond being in a similar, outlandish circumstance (e.g. being a hood ornament... literally!). In this mad world, it's good that Max isn't the be-all and end-all. Quite a lot screen time is spent on Charlize Theron's character...the fancifully named 'Imperator Furiosa'. One has to give Charlize great kudos...I doubt that any other actor has taken The Method to such an extent as to have their forearm amputated for the role! She is, in a way, a rival to Max's myth.Also impressive about the film is the cinematography and style of it all. The sea of humanity early on in the film, the aesthetic, which seems to draw on such diverse sources as 'Beneath the planet of the apes' (perhaps...foggy memory!), underground American horror films about the backwoods people and Freaks...etc.etc.etc. The refugee camp aesthetic has a distinct looking cast but I don't think that they have the memorability of the goons in Mad Max 2, with the likes of The Humungus, Wez and The Feral Kid (although he is not a goon!). Let's not forget The Gyro Captain in that latter camp too! Some really impressive visuals can be found in the dust storm sequence, which seems positively of The Apocalypse and one setting which brings to mind wastelands enchanted by an evil spell...a la 'Lord of the rings' or 'Excalibur' like. The latter setting has a surreal feel to it in stark contrast to its stark, monochrome colour palette. Perhaps for the first time in this series, the 'mad' part of the title character seems to be literalised. He has demons which torment him. To be honest, I wasn't sure where to place these in the chronology...before going into this movie, I suspected that it was set some time after the events of the original movie and perhaps before or after the events of the second. Max has numerous flashbacks which unsettle him. I did wonder if one of the faces I saw was meant to be the Feral Kid or another was meant to someone from the first movie...but the age of the character in the flashback I Fury Road made me doubt that...although the original movie isn't clear in my mind. It might very well be possible that the events of the flashbacks could be fodder for a sequel to Fury Road...assuming that they haven't been covered in the prior movies.My casual reading of the series is that the first movie was set in a remote, violent community. Some time between the events of that movie and the second, some sort of global catastrophe occurred which brought mankind back to a primitive, dog-eat-dog state. Speaking of which, there are some nice, seeming references to Mad Max 2...from the truck driven by Furiosa (is that where this movie's title derives from?) to a nice nod to the dog food scene...but turned up to 11 (something the squeamish may want to close their eyes momentarily for!).To be honest, I would have been happy for Mel Gibson to reprise his role as Max and I didn't really need 'name' overseas stars brought in, but Charlize is probably less of a marked choice than Tina Turner in Beyond Thunderdome (although she had a couple of great songs on that movie's soundtrack!). I'd place this movie behind Mad Max 2 and above Beyond Thunderdome, which I saw before rating movies at places like this. It's an exhilarating ride.",8,5,15,14 May 2015
Donnie Darko," A dreamy, intriguing and paradoxical story
","An intriguing, paradoxical and dreamlike movie about...well, that's the question. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a teenage boy who, one day, has a jet-engine drop onto his bed, seemingly from nowhere. We learn some things about Donnie...he is on medication...he sees weird things. Maybe the things he sees are the result of his medical condition, or the drugs he takes for it...or, what happens in the movie is real...could involve time travel and alternate planet Earths. The entire movie plays like a dream-which is to say it is dreamy. Some of it is a bit creepy and disturbing...so, this isn't really a movie for the kiddies.The main 'hook' of the movie is a countdown to some impending catastrophe which Donnie is trying to avert...every now and again text on the screen alerts us to the time remaining until something horrible will happen.Hopefully this description isn't too off-putting. There is humour in this movie and it is very poignant towards the end. I said before that the movie was paradoxical...which is to say that any movie dealing in this sort of subject matter will bang up against the same kind of wall. However, for me at least, I didn't let the paradoxes get in the way of appreciating this story. It probably doesn't really make sense, but you know what is being attempted and you are happy to play along with it. In any case, the movie does tie up neatly (sort of!) the issues it has been dealing with.Can't omit a truly wonderful sequence in this movie...when I saw this movie for the first time on SBS TV a couple of years ago, I think, I was reminded of what an all time classic song 'Head over heels' by Tears For Fears was. That is one of the great 'pure' pop songs of all time. It is featured in this movie...brilliantly. The sequence is dreamy and a bit like a music video. Can't tell you how aesthetically pleasing it is (presumably it works better the more you like the song though!).Seth Rogen cameos in this film-his debut? Check out '12 monkeys' if you like this kind of territory. It too is dreamy.",8,2,6,3 July 2008
The Social Network," Idiot savant
","Took a chance seeing this movie, as a film about the founder of Facebook didn't really sound that interesting. It's gotten good reviews though, so I took a punt watching it. A good thing too, as this is a great movie. Many times I found it laugh out loud funny. Some of the reviews that I had come across mentioned Justin Timberlake. Not into the top 40 music scene, so I was wondering about which person he played...and made a wrong provisional guess in the process. Timberlake does make a great entrance though.What's it about? It's the story of Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg), a talented university student who studies computers/I.T. If you don't know the name (like me), you'd know of his most famous creation...the social network website 'Facebook'. It's this website which provides the drama for the movie. Who really claims ownership of it or the idea for it? We get to see the contenders via flashbacks, prompted by legal arguments between Zuckerberg's lawyers and those attempting to sue him for recognition for their contribution to the site/concept, namely the Winklevi and one time friend Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield).What's to like about the movie? Even if the movie was intended be a demolition job on Zuckerberg (which I doubt), I like the way that you see enough of the context of events to even have sympathy for him or at least see where he was coming from when he does the things he does.Jesse Eisenberg gives a sterling performance as Zuckerberg. Only after seeing this movie did I see Eisenberg for real (in the final episode of 'The virtual revolution', namely 'Homo interneticus?'...good docu series on the web...it's history and impact). Not sure that Eisenberg gives a mimicking performance, but that's not the point...if you want reality you'd read a scholarly article, right? In any case, I suppose Eisenberg would be a worthy winner of an Academy Award for Best Actor.To my 'Idiot savant' remark in the header...that's how Zuckerberg comes across to me. No doubt he is very knowledgeable and highly intelligent, but sheesh, his Emotional IQ is at 'idiot' level. One illustration of that is in the opening sequence of the movie, where he is on a date with a student he likes (Erica Albright, played by Rooney Mara). In a way, this scene is the entire movie writ small...it's what the entire movie/life is all about, it's contended ('synedoche'...thanks to a movie by that name which I haven't seen, I now know about this word!). There's a 'cute' scene to end the movie...probably artistic licence taken there, but it bookends nicely with the opening scene.Another example of Zuckerberg's idiocy...there's a perplexing scene where Zuckerberg does what Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) tells him to do. Zuckerberg would have an IQ twice that of two people of average intelligence (presumably), but you can't help but think 'What the hell where you thinking?'. Not sure if that even was based on fact, but if it was, it paints Zuckerberg as someone who might just have jumped off a garage roof with a towel around his neck pretending to be Superman. It's that idiotic. Zuckerberg as a genius man child.One thing about Eisenberg's portrayal is that he kind of struck me as a Hannibal Lecter type figure...I mean, it wouldn't have surprised me if Zuckerberg was in fact a psychopath about to embark on a rampage. I'd modify my initial impression of him now to 'idiot savant psycohpath man child'! Here's the savant part...Eisenberg's Zuckerberg is like a robot...he seems to pull out zingers out of nowhere...like he's computed the optimal bon mot for any given circumstance. These are laugh out loud funny at times (in a 'Humans are the funniest animals' kind of way). Here's the weird thing...he comes out with this kind of stuff, but it seems like he doesn't get his own jokes. I don't know of anyone at all like that. Apart from Steven Wright. But he really is a robot. Who writes jokes for calendars. Back to Zuckerberg...he's metaphorically lobbing hand grenades left, right and centre, oblivious to the havoc he is causing, because his mind his multi-tasking, and his attention is always on something more important to him.Finally, as far as the resolution goes...interesting. Since I'm not trained as a lawyer and you don't really hear this stuff in a legal manner, I have to admit a degree of surprise with the outcome, as far as the Winklevi are concerned (that amusing term is used by Zuckerberg in the movie). Even though the genius that is attibuted to Zuckerberg in the movie seems to rest on him knowing abstract geeky stuff, to me it seemed to rest on just thinking bigger than those around him. But the rationale for the outcome is suggested by the female lawyer at the end. The outcome for Eduardo Saverin is undisclosed, like in reality. I sort of get why Zuckerberg may have done what he did...as in striking a bad deal with him, perhaps. A more lawyerly account might have made me disregard that. I certainly hope that he surpassed the Winklevi...I'm not sure that they really deserved anything.As a morality tale, this has some subtle shades of grey in it, which is what makes it a superior movie...I would have liked to have been on a jury to hear this case, but it neve got that far...and I'm Australian...so would have had to change my nationality to do so. Anyway...If you like this movie, I also recommend: 'The pirates of Silicon Valley'. It's another fact based drama on I.T. legends. Saw it on TV some years ago. Bill Gates is covered. I found myself to have more sympathy for Zuckerberg than Gates, who doesn't seem to have the same aspersions cast on him in reality as Zuckerberg does in this movie. A pity.",10,1,2,10 November 2010
The Simpsons Movie," Back to form
","Gave this movie a miss when it came out onto the big screen. In recent years this cartoon had become the kind of cartoon I always feared it would be...safe, catch-phrase laden and unfunny. In fact, I'm pretty sure that I didn't watch this cartoon for the first few years of it getting its own show-an early promo by Channel Ten in Australia made it seem like the show it would become in recent years. Was a fan of the original show though, when it was just a feature of The Tracy Ulmann Show.In any case, it's obvious from this movie that the writers of The Simpsons still had enough fuel in the tank to make a feature length movie which was actually top notch. That gives them one over South Park, which to my mind at least, failed in its transition to the big screen (I've reviewed that South Park movie at this site today).This movie is very funny with plenty of laugh out loud moments. In fact, I had a sort of Homer Simpson (main character of the show...a big, dumb guy) moment watching this...I watched the DVD extras and found myself being reminded of hilarious scenes which I had just seen not minutes ago and had forgotten about! One of my favourite scenes is where Homer is driving a sledge pulled by dogs....lots of comedy gold in this scene!Be sure to watch the end credits of this movie-there are more jokes and what must now be baby Maggie's THIRD lot of 'first word ever uttered'- that's three lots of different first words over the course of this series!One issue-this movie is in an extra wide screen format. You really need a big TV- preferably widescreen-in order to get a good sized view...especially if you like to read the end credits...which some of us do. Not quite as bad as what Channel Ten does to the end credits of programmes, where they shrink the screen to highlight those all important ads. Nearly as bad, though.A 'must see' cartoon comedy in any case.",8,0,3,4 July 2008
Alien: Covenant," You know the drill by now...but now the plot holes are starting to bother me: 70%
","This sequel to 'Prometheus' and prequel to 'Alien' treads the well-worn path of films in this franchise: a spacecraft intercepts a distress signal and changes its course in order to investigate...and then the crew come face-to-face with the horror that is the alien species which will either eat them or use the humans' bodies as a means of incubating its alien offspring.Since it's been many years since I've seen 'Prometheus' (I saw it during its cinema run as well), I have to say that I'd already forgotten the details of it when I sat down in the cinema to watch this latest instalment. For that reason, I'd suggest that you watch 'Alien: Covenant' soon after watching 'Prometheus', if you can, unless you have a really good memory! That being said, I did recognise Guy Pearce from the previous film...but drew a blank later on in the film when the character Elizabeth Shaw is mentioned...and she was the main character from that film! In other words, I couldn't remember what happened to her at the end of the previous film.When I saw a trailer for this film many, many weeks ago, I have to say that I did find it misleading...it started off as if it was a film about humans colonising a new planet and then the trailer seemed to morph into an ad for a new 'Alien' film. It made me wonder if I had missed some sort of break between trailers for two different films. I'm still wondering if a scene from that early part of the trailer was actually in the film! That being said, yes, 'Alien: Covenant' does start the story off with a spacecraft (the 'Covenant' of the title) travelling through space, carrying a cargo of breeding age humans, to colonise a new planet. Apart from one male, all the other humans are in suspended animation (anabiosis), seeing as the planet that they are going to is so far away. This being part of the 'Alien' franchise, you know that things are going to go pear-shaped pretty quickly!At times you wonder if the narrative is just meandering, like the spacecraft repair scene...but it is actually tight, as it moves the plot forward...eventually.The ending of 'Alien: Covenant' is obviously the starting point to another sequel, but I do wonder how well it will explain the aftermath of that ending as well as providing a bridge to the events of the original 'Alien' film. i.e. presumably there is a lot at stake with the ending of 'Alien: Covenant' but I'm not sure that there was any signs of how that played out in the original 'Alien' film. It just seems going around circles, which isn't really satisfying, from my point of view. Going around in circles...yet another distress signal...with yet another spacecraft going to investigate, like a fly into a Venus flytrap...with yet more lethal aliens to encounter.From memory, I found the earlier film hard to follow and looking at my review for it now, that is confirmed, along with some other elements of the film which I had forgotten. Even though 'Alien: Covenant' tries to spend more time explaining the origin of the aliens, I have to say that that often raised more questions than it answered for me! It mentions 'the virus' and I have to confess that I have no memory of that concept being used in 'Prometheus'! There's also scenes of what looks like fungi being trodden on by humans, which releases what I assume to be 'the virus'...and that really doesn't make any sense to me. Is it a virus? Is it fungal spores? How does this all hang together? Okay, let's talk about all the other things that bug me about this film...the plot holes, if you will, or just the absurditiesOne thing that bugged me a lot in this film was just how rapidly large, lethal aliens developed in such a short time. Of course, this is narratively driven, as the film wants to focus on a very short period of time and it's 'required' for the aliens to develop quickly as a result. Well, that just made me wish the film was set in another context! E.g. on a farm, where the alien could prey on livestock...or small children...before it was big enough to kill even armed adults. Perhaps this was still an issue in the original 'Alien' film...but I suppose it was just less pronounced in how quickly the alien grew to a scary size.Also, in this film the alien seems different in kind from previous films in the franchise...it's more akin to a psychopath in a slasher film than something that needs to kill humans in order to eat or create offspring. Even though I shouldn't have thoughts like the following, I can't help myself! Okay, I'm having problems with the notion of just how sustainable a human-alien co-existence would be. It seems to me that the aliens would be an existential threat to humanity...in which case, if they no longer have any prey, how on Earth are aliens themselves going to continue multiplying?Miscellaneous notes:* The end credits have an 'In memory of' for Julie Payne. Not sure who she is.* Katherine Waterston as Daniels 'Dany' Branson is good...she is small in stature but continues the franchise's form in having strong female characters...she's the alpha female, so to speak.* Looking at my notes for 'Prometheus' I noted the stupidity of the crew in that film...with this current film, I have to note how the latter part of the film is just Murphy's law writ large (ignoring the franchise trope of how humans keep coming into contact with the aliens!).",7,57,112,26 May 2017
Evil Dead II," Slapstick horror classic
","This particular movie is my favourite of the entire Evil Dead trilogy. It's a slap-stick horror-comedy classic! The first movie didn't impress me much because it was over-hyped when I was in high-school, and I didn't find it as horrific as it was made out to be. In fact, I tended to view the first movie less than scary for having monsters in it that reminded me of muppets!Anyway, this movie continues the plot of the first movie-the dire consequences that ensue when the notorious Tibetan Book of the Dead is read aloud, namely, the unleashing of lots of demons intent on killing humans.This movie contains some paradoxical time travel scenarios, which is most enjoyable.The hero of the movie has some great scenes involving parts of his body being possessed and how he goes about defeating the demon possessing him. It is riotously funny!If the first movie in this trilogy was a muppet horror movie, the second was pure slap-stick comedy and mind-bending plot-lines. The last movie in this trilogy I tend to remember as being like one of those matinée sword and sandal epics-like 'Jason and the Argonauts'. Really, three movies, yet three different genres.For the second movie, get together with some mates, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the strangeness and silliness that ensues.",8,1,2,3 June 2008
Law Abiding Citizen," Nasty intent, and execution...
","If you've ever watched 'The Texas chainsaw massacre' and thought it would have been a whole lot better if 'Leatherface' was treated sympathetically, you may enjoy this movie. Seeing the ads for this movie I thought it was some sort of bog standard vigilante movie. What separates it from that genre, I think, is the 'twist' in the 'hero' of the piece. Perhaps you could intellectualise the movie and presume that it takes the genre to its extreme, logical conclusion. Well, okay. All I saw was a movie with a heart of darkness...an insight into the American psyche...a fixation with 'justifiable homicide' in which the vicious murder of your family is a 'blessing' in that it allows these gun lovin' folks to show us how 'righteous' their blood lust is.Years ago, as a child, I saw 'Death wish' on video. Perhaps by the standards of the day it too was extreme. By comparison, 'Law abiding citizen' is torture porn, if not explicitly, then by leaving you in no doubt what manner of atrocities are committed on the 'deserving' criminals. Gerard Butler plays Clyde Shelton, a family man whose life is destroyed by a particularly vicious and brutal home invasion. The context seems implausible, and the nature of the crime even more so. It's basically the pretext to 'justify' his subsequent actions. That's why the crime is so nasty.Released around the same time as this movie is Mel Gibson's comeback, 'Edge of darkness'. I may have seen the original BBC TV series that this was based on, but aren't certain of that. I doubt if Gibson's version closely follows the original. In any case, I only raise this other movie as an example of superior story-telling. The crime there is more motivated, and Gibson's character doesn't descend into some sort of horror movie psycho, like Shelton does. Perhaps this is where the 'intellectualising' comes in...why am I not sickened by the murder of Jews during World War II yet am horrified of revelations that Nazis made soap out of the corpses of Jews and lampshades from their skin? Well, I suppose that one can rationalise and say that in war, death is certain and you can invent justifications. But when you start making furniture and cosmetics out of your victims, that is just beyond justification, right? No, Shelton does not make lampshades out of the skin of his victims, but he says what he will do to them, and we see him about to embark on some of the things he has promised to do. That's what I find so nasty about this movie...it's torture porn wrapped in the flag of righteousness.Not being from America, I find all the justifications for Shelton's actions flimsy...he often rails against the legal system...he sounds like what I imagine a rabid Fox 'News' 'journalist' would sound like on this subject.That's my take on this movie...it's a Fox 'News' story...and wet dream, all rolled into one.If you don't like your revenge fantasies to turn sick, I'd stay away from this movie...go see 'Edge of darkness' instead...much more intelligent...inclined to see the BBC version again, too.",4,7,13,23 February 2010
