Scarface," A good rendition of what's to come
",Interesting movie but the essence of it was much exaggerated to almost a caricaturised degree. The action is solid but the characters are very weak and light minded. Hope to see a remake that will more accurately portray the underlying spirit of the archetypes from which the movie was inspired. It's good to see good chemistry between the characters of the movie but I believe that was only added for artistic reasons. There are a lot of things I would add to this review but I think keeping it brief increases its reach. Overall I am feeling hopeful for a continuation of the series with different reworked characters with a better ending. Happy new era everyone.,9,2,4,10 January 2016
