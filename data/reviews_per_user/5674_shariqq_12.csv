The Incredible Hulk," You're making me sleepy... You wouldn't like me when I'm sleepy!
","HULK SMASH! Yes, the Incredible Hulk does utter those lines in this newer, updated version of the comic-book superhero movie. He does the Thunder Clap, uses two halves of a squad car as boxing gloves and does not fly for miles. The studio has spent a lot of money, hired an A-list star cast, got a famous director and even distanced itself from Ang Lee's critically-panned outing five years ago. Edward Norton re-wrote the script and Marvel has made sure the movie is littered with direct references from the Hulk comics and the Marvel universe that fan-boys will geek over. Yet, this movie misses the target quite spectacularly. It suffers from the same problem that X3 did  the movie just does not come together due to extremely poor execution and hence seems mediocre at best.The movie starts with Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) hiding away in a Brazilian town doing small jobs while researching for a cure. In the next tedious 100 minutes, we see Banner/Hulk returning to USA, fighting the US army, reuniting with Betty Ross, and facing & triumphing over arch-nemesis (a grayish, spiny, talkative Abomination).Now you hardly expect Ed Norton to go wrong, especially when he's writing as well, but this has to be the vainest attempt by the actor yet. Bruce Banner's portrayal fails because his green monster brings never brings any sense of threat to his scientist. We see him suffer without clothes, money and shelter but we never really see him suffer under the weight of guilt or responsibility for the force of destruction within him. This not only makes the Hulk that less effective, but his oft-repeated roar and mayhem seems superficial. A bimbo Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and reluctant semi-pacifist Gen. T Ross (William Hurt) don't help matters much. Tim Roth (pre-mutation) comes as a huge saving grace though. His Russian-born, British-schooled operative Emil Blonsky may just be the one of the best supervillain characters yet. Without much of a backstory, and with absolutely no insight into his psyche, he still makes the vile and single-minded Blonsky a formidable opponent  one that I cheered for! Yet, the bad CGI and campy dialogues bring any momentary expectations crashing down. (It has one of *the* worst dialogues this year: 'You're making me hungry you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry'!!) It comes as no surprise though that the deathmatch finale is all mind-pollution. The numerous plot-holes and the unforgivable sin of using Hulk for comic relief just plunges the standards of this movie lower.One thing though  with Ironman and now with Incredible Hulk, Marvel studios has hit the perfect formula to close these movies. Even if the movie is bitter or bland, you finish with a touch of excitement.My rating --> 2 of 5 p.s.: The movie can't help but make references to Ang Lee's movie through out its running  the starting notes of the theme music, the opening scene, the dialogues ('he has managed to stay unseen for five years', HULK released in 2003). IMHO, I think it is about time the world revisited HULK, and give it its due.",4,6,10,19 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Put Jack Black's voice in a warm big fluffy Panda, and you just have to love him.
","Even though he is as much a motor-mouth as so many other actors who become annoying with time, there is something incessantly likable about Jack Black. Put his voice in a warm big fluffy Panda, and you just have to love him. Put this Panda in a Kung Fu setting complete with training-school dojo, grand masters and a nemesis to fear, and you have the first Dreamworks Animation movie that can stand up among Pixar's annual excellence as one of the best 3D animation movies made.A Giant Panda is a 250-pound black-and-white bear that lives in the mountains of China, and although carnivorous, the panda has a diet which is 99% bamboo. That's how pacifist it is. But when Po (Jack Black) gets accidentally selected as the mighty Dragon Warrior by the Grand Master, there is no option left but for Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to train the clumsy Panda into a Warrior of the highest order  much to the resentment of the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Crane, Mantis). But Po, as much as he loves Kung Fu lore, would rather eat. Yes, that's how pacifist he is. But Master Shifu has not much choice as his ex-student, the evil Tai Lung, has escaped from his maximum security prison to claim the position of Dragon Warrior for himself.Some sequences in this movie are breathtaking, I exulted at the thought of animation finally telling us such diverse stories. Two sequences (and this is not a spoiler): Tai Lung's escape from prison and the foot-bridge fight are extraordinary in exigency. Dreamworks has been churning out animated movies for a few years now, but apart from Shrek, none of their movies have really hit any mark. But this is easily the best animated movie out of their bucket yet. The voice cast, although stellar, does not overshadow the characters with their star-power. The likes of Jackie Chan and Angelina Jolie get limited voice-time, but just as much as the movie requires. Jack Black & Dustin Hoffman are wonderful as loud obnoxious student & controlled cool master. And unlike Madagascar, the movie has very soft colors, curves and a glowing focus. It works very well with the cuddly look of the Panda.A special mention for Tai Lung. Not since Lion King's Scar has a villain taken himself so seriously. Tai Lung is a warrior extraordinaire, and he is beyond humor or humility. Just like Jeremy Irons' Scar, Ian McShane's Tai Lung speaks with a sense of superiority. It makes him that much more of a nemesis  a villain worthy of a much more formidable opponent than a pacifist panda. See, that's how impressive his sense of superiority is!

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A very simple fantasy story made into a very simple movie with spectacular results
","The box office record of USA does make sense when comparing the Narnia movie to King Kong. Although the latter is a better movie in my book, there are a sizeable few who didn't like it. But Narnia is a movie that everyone can like & enjoy - from Kids to Parents, Guys & Girls.The movie starts off with an introduction of the Pevensie children in the middle of an Air Raid during World War II. Promptly, their mom packs them away to the country house of an Elderly uncle where soon they discover a wardrobe that opens into the Magical Land of Narnia. A once peaceful and serene land of talking beasts is now taken over by the Evil Witch Jadis, plummeting the world into a perpetual winter. The children are there as a part of a prophecy that the witch would be defeated, and warmth will shine on Narnia again.Adam Anderson successfully makes a movie that, unlike the Harry Potter series, never tries too hard to be grand. And for the same reason it becomes a wonderfully grand piece. Here is again a director who really knows his subject well, and you can sense his understanding of the world from the creative liberty he takes with the story. The extended opening scene, the prep & actual battle are not in the book at all. Yet he unfolds it like it were from the mind of C S Lewis himself. He also presents the movie from a beautiful eye, which more than helps to make this a lock for the home-video market. Although the CGI of the movie is at its best it is not unlike the best that we have already seen. That makes it less noticeable and more awe-worthy. This combined with good voice-work, the talking animals come across with all authenticity and no corniness. The children themselves do a good job of acting in the company of these imaginary creatures, with the best turn coming from the second youngest: Edmund, mainly because of the dilemma he faces.At the end, it all works because it is a very simple fantasy story made into a very simple movie with spectacular results.My Rating ---> 4/5",8,0,0,16 January 2006
Cloverfield," Strong Stomach? Be ready for a fun ride!
","Cloverfield is to monster movies what Blair Witch Project is to horror movies. But while the latter was a gimicky low-budget fiasco (forget Box Office, it is no measure of quality), Cloverfield is a decently budgeted polished piece of film-making.Shot entirely from the POV of a hand-held digicam initially being used to make a home-video, the movie takes us through the disaster that NY faces through the experiences of a small group of youths. So while the camera focuses on the bunch of three-four friends, the backdrop shows us what we would have seen in full-focus in a Godzilla or Independence Day - Buildings collapsing, destruction all-around, the monster in attack-mode, the army retaliating, etc.What really impressed me was the way the movie uses most of its budget (physical/visual effects) only for the background. The production has done a wonderful job in recreating an extraordinary event as it would look, and have a few regular people to react to it. Soon after the first disruption, immediate thoughts go to survivors of 9/11 and their experience to the actuality of the disaster.Mixed reactions to the movie are mostly because hand-held video for the entirety of the movie can induce motion-sickness though. There were a few walk-outs mid-way, and I know of people running to the toilets due to the shaking effect throughout. As long as you are prepared for and have the stomach for it, be ready for an experiment of a movie that actually works as an experience.",8,0,1,8 February 2008
Wanted," Slo-mo moves out of the shadow of The Matrix.
","n the midst of slow-motion action, gravity-defying leaps, bullet-time sequences and curving bullets, the hero puts on a pair of sunglasses, then promptly takes them off quipping 'Bad idea!'. Wanted belongs to the generation of movies after The Matrix that have benefited from the success of slo-mo stylized and choreographed action sequences. But Wanted distinguishes itself in the most prominent way possible: it enjoys what it is.Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a regular office cubicle-dweller who discovers, in quite style, that he is the son of a legendary assassin. Mastering his 400-beats per minute heartbeat to super-sense makes him one of the Fraternity, a group of assassins led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman) that exist as the hand of fate. As Fox (Angelina Jolie) says: Kill one, maybe save a thousand.Timur Bekmambetov, the Russian director of visual stunners Nightwatch and Daywatch, brings the same manic imagination to Hollywood that has become his forte. Kids with toys hardly come up with wilder sequences. These set-pieces occur in frequent intervals through out the movie with enough story filling in-between them to make the movie work, starting with a jaw-dropping gun-fight involving two skyscrapers. Almost all of the action is physically impossible, so the movie does require a suspension of belief. But having Angeline Jolie as the instigator of most of these scenes only adds to them; she resonates the screen with a coolness that makes it far easier to enjoy what could otherwise be quite absurd. Look out for her scenes with the red car  who else can pull that off with such charm? Morgan Freeman, as the leader of the assassins, is voice and presence. It is always a relief to watch Morgan Freeman play characters like Sloan (or The Boss from Lucky Number Slevin) after all the serious work he does.Surprisingly, after the movie is over and you have left the cinema, you are not left with just an imprint of some screenshots of visual beauty. Wanted has a life longer than usual popcorn summer movies. It has a rare mix of arrogance and humility that brings it closer to home and makes it likable in retrospect. Saying any more would be giving away too much.My rating --> 3.5 of 5",7,1,4,20 July 2008
Twilight," As good as mediocre can be.
","When watching a movie that is clearly not intended for you, it's best to let yourself flow with it and judge it on its own merits rather than on pre-conceived notions or prejudices. So with that in mind I walked into a screening of Twilight, clearly aimed at the tween female audience, expecting to watch a vampire-love-story - and it actually turned out to be exactly that! So, in essence, it was not disappointing.Twilight is the first movie in a four-part saga adapted from Stephenie Meyer's best selling books, and is mostly depicted and narrated from the viewpoint of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). Bella is the beautiful girl-next-door type that exists only in movies. She moves in with her Dad, Chief of Police at Forks, Washington and joins the local high-school where she eventually befriends Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) who turns out to be a vampire.The Cullens, family of seven including a father & mother figure with adopted 'children', are good vampires who are just trying to live a normal life in a city that keeps them away from the sun as much as possible. But there are Vampires of the bad kind too and do make the essential appearance. Yet it is mostly Forbidden Love that keeps Bella and Edward as the center of attention in this tale.As vampire movies go Hardwicke has made an interesting movie that, while realizing there is not much new in the source material to add to the myth, concentrates on the relationship and dilemma of Bella. And barring a melodramatic outburst, Kirsten Stewart succeeds in delivering a performance that mostly requires her to look inquisitive and pretty. Robert Pattinson, on the other hand, has to be the most underwhelming B-actor to debut in a box office phenomenon. Apart from the confused/constipated look that he sets a new standard for, Pattinson's performance has 'wannabe' stamped all over it; definitely something that does not add to his portrayal of a vampire. Most of the other actors are acceptable in performances that would be equally at home in a TV series. The one that does stand out is Peter Facinelli as Dr Carlisle Cullen, Edward's foster father. Facinelli, although on screen for four scenes, plays his character of a vampire trying to be good with a cool resonance and more importantly, looks the part.Hardwicke's movie will please the target audience, that there is no doubt about. It's quite visible in the way she harmonizes the scenes - the colors, music & visuals are very soft and pleasing to the senses. It makes Twilight an easy time at the movies - there's no intelligence here, but no stupidity either.My Rating --> 3 of 5",6,1,3,25 December 2008
The Hurt Locker," Putting Bombs Away
","Kathryn Bigelow is one of the few woman directors in Hollywood who can make a good action movies for the boys. With Heat Locker, this protégé of James Cameron turns up the heat in a movie clearly for the testosterone audience. Set in Iraq, the movie looks at a bunch of Bomb Disposal experts who are stationed in Baghdad for a count of days. As these men go through bomb after bomb losing fellow-soldiers along the way, the movie impresses upon the hopeless state to which the war-zone has fallen, and the mostly thankless high-risk job of the soldiers that risk their lives there. Yet the movie is not about the war, or its politics, but a zoned in look at one team's existence in it. While one soldier counts his days until they're relieved from duty, another lives at the thrill that the risk of their job brings them. Some great bomb sequences, a supremely-confidant lead performance by Jeremy Renner and a few awesome great cameos make this a great time at the movies. At least for the boys.",7,35,76,10 January 2009
The Dark Knight," A saga of crime that is not expected of a superhero movie
","One week of release and The Dark Knight has broken every major box-office record it could, even touching IMDb's top spot in highest rated movies. This fervor, attributed mainly to the ingenious viral marketing campaign and the tragic demise of Heath Ledger, dictates the response to the movie being as emphatic as it is. Once the noise settles, sifting through that manic praise, the movie surfaces as a great crime-saga, even one of the best ever made. It just happens to be a Batman movie.In the closing moments of Batman Begins, we believe that Gotham city now has a savior in Batman. And quite so, The Dark Knight begins with batman-wannabes combating scared criminals, and nervous mob bosses holding meetings during the day. In the tradition of 'Gravitas, Pietas, Dignitas' the new district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), joins forces with Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Batman (Christian Bale) to rinse Gotham of the crime wave that grips it. What they or the criminals don't expect is a madman, the Joker (Heath Ledger), taking matters into his own hands.Much like Batman, the Joker uses fear as his main weapon. But what makes him truly scary is his lack of moralities  he crosses every line that holds Batman to good. In doing so, he becomes Batman's opposite. And equal. Heath Ledger plays the Joker with an eccentric freedom hardly seen before, and in doing so comes as close as humanly possible to the demented Joker of the comic books. His stammering speech and shuffling walk exemplify the chaos in his mind. The Joker brings such dread, that you anticipate yet fear his arrival on screen  there are no limits to what he would do. In facing him, Batman and Harvey Dent are pushed to a limit that neither should cross.At 2hrs 32mins, the movie is relentless and unforgiving. 'The night is darkest before the dawn', proclaims Harvey Dent in once scene. 'Why so serious?' asks the Joker in another. Christopher Nolan humorlessly depicts Gotham at its darkest hour, and weaves a saga of crime that is not expected of a superhero movie. The characters are given a depth that makes them as believable as timeless. Indeed, the movie transcends the comic-book-movie genre to reach a level of sophistication hardly ever attributed to superheroes. It makes for almost-a-must multiple watch.In becoming what it is, where the movie does disappoint is in its superhero parts. In favor of the story, sacrifices are made of Batman. Being one of the world's favorite super heroes, it does become injustice to not depict his iconography  visual representations of his towering persona, the batcave being replaced with a secret garage, the Harvey Dent arc in favor of the Batman-Joker conflict. Christopher Nolan, in making an exemplary movie has sacrificed Batman and pushed himself into a corner. If he does complete his trilogy, he would have to go back to the dark knight.",9,3,8,25 July 2008
The Happening," It might be cliché, but it has to be said: The Happening is not happening.
","Shyamalan has proved to us earlier that he can be as good as the best with masterpieces of cinema with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Yet, since then, he has declined steadily. Signs and Village were good movies, but with Lady in the Water and now The Happening, he has touched a level of incompetence that could never have been expected of him.The Happening is about a pandemic that is gripping north-eastern USA. It starts with a stunning sequence of events that show people succumb to an unspecified threat  the brilliance of this opening repeated only once more for a five-minute sequence towards the end of the movie. Unfortunately, Shyamalan's writing is a big let-down for the rest. As the focus moves from metropolitans to towns and from crowds to smaller groups, the sense of fear is lost  the biggest sin a horror movie can commit. In the oft repeated criticism for its director, this movie would have been best served as a half-hour episode of Twilight Zone to make it really work.And to add woe, the actors do not do much to better the experience  Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are grossly miscast as the protagonists. Any of his previous leading men (Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Paul Giamatti) can be imagined to have done a better job for the Science teacher that Wahlberg plays. The camera scrutinizes the performance to a degree that requires an actor with strength in emotions  Wahlberg instead brings a physical presence that the role does not need. Zooey, on the other hand, struts around like in a Disney movie, not for once threatened by the pandemonium.This time, though Shyamalan humbles his vanity  you don't see him on screen. He now should swallow his pride and leave the writing to the writers. Armed with a better script, we can still expect Shyamalan to make his future movies worth waiting for. For now it is only the memory of the opening sequence, which can be proclaimed as mind-numbing greatness, which is really worth taking away from this movie.",4,495,858,12 June 2008
Iron Man," Like a Cheese Burger - nothing more, nothing less.
","Since Batman Begins released three years ago, most new superhero movies have been particular about their casting  especially about the non-lead characters  and also great care is taken to please the geeks with trivia scattered all about the movie. Iron Man is the first such 'production line' movie for Marvel since they have started producing their own movies. And with all our luck, they succeed. Iron Man balances a big budget/big explosions popcorn movie with a host of intelligent actors to make it a worthy opener for Hollywood's Summer Season this year.Iron Man is an origin story that focuses on how genius billionaire industrialist playboy inventor Tony Stark goes from creator of WMDs to an iron-clad superhero standing up against selfish war-mongering. Robert Downey Jr. plays Stark as a fast-talking faster-thinking man-boy, yet instills likability to his shallowness. Get this: his secretary reminds him it's her birthday; he asks her to get herself a present from him; she says she already has; he then actually asks her if she likes it! The secretary (& babysitter) is played by Gwyneth Paltrow in a very cute turn - she harbors a secret crush on her boss yet is conscious of their social difference. Terrence Howard plays Stark's best buddy and the Army's liaison to Stark Industries (fanboys: hint, hint!). The supporting character that does stand out though is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane in a menacing bald & beard look accentuates his jaunty performance. It just shows how important it is to have a strong actor in villain roles (think Brian Cox from X2).John Favreau does not really carry a legacy to set any valid expectations for his latest movie. Considering he did a passable turn with Zathura, most of the anticipation for Iron Man comes from recognition of the superhero himself and the wonderful cast. Each of the four actors brings a conviction to their characters that lend the required believability to the world they inhabit. And yet, the movie recognizes itself to be an entertainer and sticks to its purpose. It finds a niche spot between the successes of Batman Begins and the Transformers movie. Much like the Cheese Burger that Tony Stark craves  it is fun, fulfilling and easy. Nothing more, nothing less.",7,0,3,7 May 2008
300," Wonderfully visceral and testosteronefuelled experience
","Before, during and after watching this movie I realize this movie was made with just one purpose - to entertain. No social messages, no character study. Just plain fun. Well, maybe not so plain, but sure as hell lots of fun.I have not read the book; hence I am not in a position to judge how true the movie stays to the book - in look or in feel. Watching the movie in itself is such a wonderfully visceral and testosteronefuelled experience that it stands for itself apart from the book.In essence, Snyder has taken the elemental attraction from what was Blade's Blood-Bath or Matrix' Security Shoot-out and made an entire movie out of it. Over-done? Heck no. Exhausting? Heck Yeah!The movie depicts the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C of 300 Spartans that held the Persian Army of thousands for three days (giving Greece enough time to raise their own army for defense) before falling, but told in Frank Miller's heavily-exaggerated and violently Politically Incorrect style. Gerard Butler plays the bearded, screaming Spartan King.The exaggerations of Spartans into Herculean warriors and of Persians (and their army) into grotesque mutant abominations are as much a part of fictionalized and stylized story-telling as are the fantastic beauty-enhanced visuals. From the expansive use of Slow-motion (most of the movie was shot at high-speeds between 50-150fps vs a norm of 24fps) and painting the movie in shades of only three colors (Black to White, Yellow to Brown, Red) to the extensively choreographed battle moves and formations  this movie does not have a single frame that does not look like an art-still. And as a story-teller, Snyder (or Miller?) spins his tales large but roots it firmly within the world realized in the movie with a dramatic voice-over by David Wenham (much like his Faramir of the LOTR trilogy). And the movie has some amazing dialogues - as dramatic and exaggerated as everything else within the movie. (Xerxes: Cruel Leonidas demanded that you stand. I require only that you kneel.) Snyder has set a new bench-mark for stylized visuals with this movie  something that tends to be set too often now-a-days. But upping the ante can only bring better things to us as viewers. 300 is exactly what it set out to be. Looking for historical facts, trying to tie it down to current events or expecting deeper meaning within this fun-fest is being fool-hardy.",8,22,45,23 March 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," A wonderful celebration of hope, destiny and Cinema.
","Once in a while you get to watch a movie like Slumdog Millionaire. A well-crafted, well-written tale of destiny and triumph, Danny Boyle and Lavena Tandon take us through three timelines simultaneously in Jamal Malik's journey from Dharavi's slums to the Hot Seat of the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. Encountering a wave of colorful characters along the way and events that leave lasting imprints on his mind, Jamal eventually plays the game with one purpose - and it's not winning.Laced with a wonderful engaging soundtrack by A R Rehman, many scenes of young Jamal are presented with such charm and down-to-earth honesty that you start rooting for the protagonist early on. A few Bollywood actors fill in some of the supporting roles, notable Anil Kapoor, Irfan Khan and Mahesh Manjrekar, to bring added vibrancy to a movie set against and for the undying spirit of a city that's seen it all.Unfortunately, and in a bad choice by the makers, they have made the movie predominantly in the English language. Those familiar with the city, country or the culture will find it absurd that a boy from the slums speaks with a British accent, let alone that most of the other characters are conversing in English (the cop & his 'havaldar' or the 'bhai').This glaring issue aside, the movie succeeds on all accounts as a wonderful celebration of hope, destiny and definitely of Cinema.",8,1,3,20 December 2008
