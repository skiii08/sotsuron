Source Code," A genre mainstay until another far-fetched killer brainchild comes across the big screen.
","This has got to be the best Sci-Fi/Love Story plot I've ever watched since The Lakehouse. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who has got a knack of dealing with mind-boggling scenarios while enjoying the melodramatic mood. This of course has some violent scenes typical for its own stretched-out plot of a time bomb set on a train and afterward the possibility a citywide holocaust. Jake's acting has been driving and very involving. Michelle Monaghan is cute. She did it well and much relaxed. Though the mystery is easy off since the crime perpetrator can be guessed off pretty in the early minutes of the movie, the winning part of the movie is by how every piece of evidence is stitched into one whole revelation and the realization that this has go to be a love story. The ending surprisingly is most rewarding and would bring you to several what- if's and how-come's. Definitely worth watching and a genre mainstay until another far-fetched killer brainchild comes across the big screen.",9,2,4,13 May 2011
