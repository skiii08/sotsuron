United 93," a perfectly, greatly done film!
","I think that everyone in the world should see this film. We are all on board United 93 whether we like it or not. We all can imagine what each of us would do in such a terrifying, harrowing situation -- how frightening to be trapped on board an airplane completely out of our control! But the film goes far beyond that. It is simply the finest crafted film I have ever seen. What got me the most was the fact that no matter how many times I have seen it, it seems so profoundly real -- because it is real! The acting and direction are superb. It is excruciating and chilling from the opening scene, and I was holding on with gripped emotions during the entire movie. In all honesty, this film moved me so much that it made me wish I was on board United 93 fighting those totally mad terrorists! Their courage and (and intelligence) to surmise what was happening and put a plan together to fight back, I will never forget or cease to be inspired by. My only struggle -- and a big one at that -- is the intense anger I feel over our own stupidity in letting these terrorists on board with knives!",10,0,1,9 September 2007
