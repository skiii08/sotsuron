Skyfall," Just Awful !
","This movie was so bad, the wife and looked at each other, got up, and WALKED OUT of the theater!The plot is muddled and boring, the dialog is stilted, the characters are all cartoonish and ridiculous, the gadgets are old hat, the danger is laughable, the cinematography, editing and direction are awful, the acting is wooden and uninteresting, and so on...Bond just ain't what he used to be. Fleming intended Bond to be a low-key, sophisticated, Gentleman spy. Sean Connery's interpretation was as close to that as any of the Bonds. Daniel Craig's Bond is just a low-class thug.Ms. Broccoli... You have single-handedly RUINED the Bond franchise!",1,17,35,10 January 2013
Bridesmaids," Garbage! Run the other way from this movie!
","It's another one-idea movie that isn't funny and has some really bad acting! It must be embarrassing for such a talented actress as Melissa McCarthy to be in such a piece of excrement. Kristen Wiig is untalented and not funny (like her characters on SNL). Maya Rudolph is as obnoxious as usual. The other girls are instantly forgettable (thank God).Kristen Wiig's script is LOUSY. It rates right down there with Ishtar. They should have hired a real writer. The jokes are forced. They might be funny if you're 12 years old and get a giggle out of bathroom humor. And when is Hollywood going to realize that 'Akward' character reactions aren't funny. They haven't learned it since Jerry Lewis did them all 50 years ago!I can't believe I actually bought the Blu-Ray for my wife. I can never get those 2 hours of my life, or my money back. I wanted to walk out, but then I wold have been in my front yard watching the grass grow....which would have been FAR more interesting!",1,14,28,6 March 2012
Murder on the Orient Express," Simply awful
","IMHO... The acting was wooden, the screenplay didn't flow very well, and that stupid mustache that Kenneth Branagh was wearing was ridiculous. I couldn't pay attention to the movie because I was staring at that stupid mustache. The original movie, which I saw in the theater when it came out, was 10 times better and a perfectly executed masterpiece. There was simply no need for a remake.",2,2,2,1 May 2019
