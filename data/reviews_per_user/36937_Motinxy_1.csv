The Devil's Advocate," It could be a masterpiece
",The Devil's Advocate (1997)I happily was avoiding those unexplained things until that ending portion came up where Kevin get that it was just a thought and he thought all those just in a second. When that second was over the whole movie just got killed.I liked it till that last scene. I was ready to avoid mistakes like :Mary Ann gets sicker and sicker but why was she actually getting sick? Loneliness? For real? She was not actually that lonely? She had friends next door. making her sick was really a very important part but She gets sick miraculously no one knows the reason.What was Pacino doing in the last scene? he was never real in the whole movie then how he ended up being in reality? It could be a great movie with some changes. They just could have ended the movie where Kevin shot himself. They wanted audience to leave theatre in a good mood. But 4 minutes was not enough to do that.All characters were well developed but not the story. Some changes and it could be a masterpiece. This was a very beautifully acted movie & what a beautiful background score. It's just the story that making me sad.after all I enjoyed it.,5,1,3,21 April 2018
