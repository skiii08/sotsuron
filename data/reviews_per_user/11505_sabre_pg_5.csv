Skyfall," Bond is back!
","I'll jump straight to the point here. This has to be the best Bond movie since Connery shhhluurped his way through his last on screen vodka martini! The trademark 'pre-title' sequence is back in all its glory with a fantastic chase through Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, taking the audience on one of the films many white knuckle rides. This sequence closes into the opening credits backed by the powerful voice of Adele belting out the movie's theme song.The storyline is about a stolen computer drive containing the names of NATO agents embedded in terrorist organisation's across the globe for which Bonds chief 'M', played again by Judi Dench, must take responsibility. Ultimately the story focuses on Dench's character as she becomes the target for revenge by a former agent, Silva(Javier Bardem)she abandoned to the Chinese some years ago.The action rockets the movie through some fantastic scenes which are mostly played out on Bonds home territory, with some explosive action through the London streets and on the tube, and a fantastic shootout finale' in the Scottish Highlands which may leave a lump in your throat! Daniel Craig's Bond has matured since his last outing yet still has moments where he is shaken and stirred a little more than his Martini, even though he seems to prefer lager straight out of the bottle these days. I've often thought that Connery's Bond was tough enough but with not enough emotional side and Timothy Dalton's Bond was sophisticated but far too sensitive, a mixture of the two could make the perfect James Bond, in Skyfall Daniel Craig come's closest there has ever been to that Bond!",10,7,23,26 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disney hated Star Wars so much they bought it to destroy it.
","I really dont know where to begin with this chaotic final slice of Disney's disastrous efforts to complete the Star Wars Saga. The Force Awakens was weak, The Last Jedi was awful, but The Rise of Skywalker truly sticks a dirty big middle finger in the faces of the fans. Disney must have hated Star Wars so much they had to buy it so they could destroy it. I'm really not kidding when I say this either because having the Star Wars tag in front of the title meant Disney knew whatever pig swill they churned out was always going to make them a big fat profit. I genuinely believe they absolutely despise Star Wars, its lore, its creator and its fan base, this is the only possible reason they made this sequel trilogy with such utter contempt for everything that made Star Wars great.The prequel trilogy was about Anakin Skywalker
The original trilogy was about Luke and Leia Skywalker
The sequel trilogy is about trying to destroy the first two trilogies.From this day true fans will say that the Star Wars saga ended with Return of the Jedi.",1,272,531,19 December 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," CAPTAIN America! made in England
","I only went to see this US propaganda pantomime because I watched some of it being filmed in Liverpool England, and although watching it being made was a long drawn out and painful process I didn't realise watching the finished movie would be a far worse experience! Im really going to keep this short and to the point (which is what the films production team should have considered doing) The film starts slowly picks up about a third of the way through and then coughs and falls over! The action scenes are poor and not what you would expect if you have ever read the comic book, however the acting isn't bad but then quite a number of the cast are British playing Americans.The whole thing would have been much better as a computer animated movie with plenty of tongue in cheek humour thrown in! If there is a sequel I hope they don't make it in Liverpool again as I could do without that dock road being closed for another two weeks as I have to drive home from work down there! also I would rather lose a limb than have to watch anymore of this tripe!",Null,0,1,14 October 2011
The Queen," An entertaining 90 minutes but don't forget the beers!
","Helen Mirren makes every effort to look as miserable as possible playing Mrs W, but sometimes you just feel she is about to burst out laughing, especially during a crucial scene! James Cromwell, as the Duke of Edinburgh, follows her Majesty around like some demented corgi while trying to say as little as possible, and quite rightly so, as every time American actors try to sound English they usually sound like American actors trying to sound English, and the least said about Michael Sheen the better! I've noticed some of our American cousins who have watched this movie have taken it to heart, and as usual believe everything they see on the screen. No commercial movie ever made has ever portrayed the absolute truth, telling the truth doesn't make money, and this film is no exception. Its about as far removed from reality as most other Hollywood money spinners.I'm British born and bred, and I grew up following the lives of the royals as my parents found them amusing. The movie is quite funny and does entertain as long as your not stupid enough to place your faith in it! so have a few beers and enjoy it... but set your alarm clock just in case!",5,14,48,9 September 2006
Casino Royale," Fantastic!
","This is the real deal, Ian Fleming can now rest in peace, his 'James Bond' has finally come to life! With just one movie Daniel Craig takes Sean Connerys crown as the best Bond ever, and will catapult him from obscure British TV actor to massive Hollywood mega-star.This movie is well scripted, brilliantly directed, beautifully shot, and professionally written. The action scenes leave you completely breathless, especially the chase around the building site, and with one or two unexpected frights during quieter scenes be careful not to choke on your hot dog!Its a shame we can only give this movie 10 stars,Simply awesome!",10,1,4,17 November 2006
