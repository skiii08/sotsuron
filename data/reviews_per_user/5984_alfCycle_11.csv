The Mask," Still fun after all these years
","I loved this movie as a kid in the 90s. I couldn't say how many times I've seen it. A safe bet would probably be more than 20. However, I hadn't watched it in about 15-20 years. There are lots of movies I loved as a kid that don't hold up too well when viewed as an adult. This one is still a whole lot of fun to watch even today. Surprisingly, the special effects are still pretty damn good. I've watched some 90s movies more recently where the special effects looked awful and distracting by today's standards. I can't say there was any particular scene in The Mask where I thought the effects were noticeably lacking. This movie does not take itself too seriously. It is basically a live action Looney Tunes cartoon. This could easily come across as obnoxious and dumb, but this film really pulls it off in the best possible way. Jim Carrey was perfect for this role. I can't imagine anyone else as The Mask. I also loved the use of music in the film. The song and dance numbers are highly entertaining. Overall, The Mask is just a really fun movie and anyone that enjoys those old Looney Tunes cartoons should have a good time watching.8/10************SPOILERS************Recommended for those that enjoy looney tunes super powers, really smart dogs, nice guys that can't catch a break, bumbling cops, douchebag gangster villains, 90s henchmen, condom jokes that go over kids heads, sexual innuendo, breaking the fourth wall, atomic wedgies, anally intrusive consumer feedback, swinging dance numbers, conga lines, ass biting, head p*ssing, bomb swallowing......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: 10+",8,2,2,7 June 2017
Alien 3," Passable Sequel of Diminished Quality (Assembly Cut)
","This is a review for the Assembly Cut version of the film. I have not seen the theatrical version. This film is a considerable step down from the first two. However, I still found it mildly entertaining. Most of the positives probably stem from the built up equity from the first two films and the character of Ripley. Some of the special effects do not hold up well. The scenes where the alien is moving around look pretty awful. I found the final act to be a bit jumbled and disorientating. Too many alien pov running shots. Overall, if you really like the first two movies and want to know what happens next, you might find some entertainment in this film, at least the assembly cut version. 6/10...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once",6,0,2,27 April 2017
The Birth of a Nation," Technical Achievement or Racist Garbage?...
","As a piece of technical film making, it is an amazing achievement for its time. As a piece of narrative storytelling, it is the most absurdly racist pile of garbage I've ever seen. I understand this movie's importance in the history of film, but as a balance between craft and subject matter, the putrid vile that is the latter undercuts the historical significance of the former.1/10...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once",1,3,12,26 April 2017
Alien: Resurrection," Fourth Installment Is Worst of the Franchise
","This was actually the first of the Alien movies that I watched back in the late 90s as a 12-13 year old. I remember thinking that it was pretty cool. Watched it again recently and, well, not so much.... You basically need to check your brain at the door to get some fun out of this movie. Not much of the plot makes sense, so you just have to go with it. It's not god awful, it's just pretty bad. If you're a fan of the Alien movies, as I am, you can watch out of curiosity to see where the franchise goes, but I wouldn't go in expecting to actually like the movie. Recommended for those that enjoy aliens, alien clones, human clones, human/alien clone hybrids, human/alien clone hybrids with mommy issues, ricocheting target practice, basketball, impressive lung capacities, underhanded military douches, underhanded military douches getting their comeuppance, extreme suction...4/10...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Twice",4,1,2,27 April 2017
Alien," Horror / Sci-Fi Classic
","This movie is a classic of the horror and sci-fi genres. The direction and pacing create a great sense of tension and suspense. For new viewers, the sense of suspense may be diminished, since they will have likely seen many of these horror devices used in countless other movies that were released after this film. The design of the alien is still one of the best in movie history. The interior design of the ship looks great. The iconic chest burst scene is still awesome to watch, even for those that have seen Space Balls. 'Hello my baby, hello my honey...'8/10...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Twice",8,1,2,27 April 2017
Predator," AVP: AHHHnold vs Predator
","As far as 80s action movies go, this is one of the better entries. Plenty of great one liners and probably one of the best AHHHnold performances. Some of the special effects are dated, but it shouldn't detract much from the enjoyment of the film. I felt the jungle setting was well utilized. The third act manages to to be highly entertaining with barely any dialogue. Overall, this is a fun, well made action movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Recommended for those that ain't got time to bleed!7/10...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once",7,1,1,28 April 2017
Aliens," Mostly Watch This Movie At Night, Mostly
","Unlike the first film, which is mainly a horror/suspense film, ALIENS is a balls out action movie. I think I actually enjoy this movie slightly more than the original. The character of Ripely is more flushed out and she goes full on badass in this movie. I also liked the supporting characters in this movie more so than the first. Likely because the adrenaline levels are turned up and the characters can be more colorful (or colourful in Canadian!). This is a review of the theatrical version, as I have yet to see the directors cut. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made. Recommended for those that enjoy aliens, aliens killing people, people killing aliens, aliens laying eggs, creepy children, underhanded corporate douches, underhanded corporate douches getting their comeuppance, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Forklifts, badass marines dudes, badass marine ladies, android parlour tricks... 8/10...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Twice",8,3,5,27 April 2017
Independence Day," Big, dumb and fun
","This is an example of a big, dumb summer blockbuster that's also quite entertaining. As a kid in the 90's I couldn't get enough of this movie. I've probably watched it about a dozen times in my life, but watched it as an adult for the first time recently in preparation for the sequel. As a kid I didn't really see all the flaws that this movie has, and it does have many! I just really enjoyed the spectacle of it all. I can still enjoy that spectacle, but the weak and often ridiculous plot points definitely stand out now as an adult. This movie is full of cheese, which makes it both fun at times while inducing eye rolling at other times. You can't really take this movie too seriously without realizing just how stupid it is, but if you turn off your brain you can have fun with this movie. I think it's able to keep itself from crossing that line into the overly obnoxious that most of these types of movies often go crashing through (ahh-hem Michael Bay!). The special effects still hold up pretty well, especially when compared to other movies of that time frame. Overall, this is not a good movie, but it is fun and entertaining.6/10************SPOILERS************Recommended for those that enjoy alien invasions, hot shot pilots, cable repair nerds, patriotism, rousing speeches, exploding cars, exploding helicopters, exploding jets, exploding buildings, exploding landmarks, exploding cities, exploding spaceships, universal cross- platform compatibility......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: 10+",6,0,1,15 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," One of the most entertaining Marvel movies
","I really enjoyed this movie. It's full of great characters, humor, special effects and fun action scenes. Oh!, and of course the fantastic soundtrack! I would definitely rank this as one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first time I watched it the villain, Ronan, kind of annoyed me, but on the second viewing I didn't get the same feeling about that character. His kind of over the top menacing bad guy routine sort of works with the overall goofy tone of the film. I love how this movie takes these virtually unknown characters and really makes you want to see more of them in the future. I also admire how this film doesn't take itself seriously without crossing the line of becoming a full on parody of the superhero genre. This comes from the skillful execution and placement of the humor throughout the movie.8/10************SPOILERS************ Recommended for those that enjoy K-Billy's super sounds of the 70's, orphan abduction, hot shot renegade smart alecks with big hearts, disgruntled ex-blue man group members, green is the new black, daddy issues, literal interpretations of the spoken word, talking space rodents, talking space plants, I am Groot!, I! am Groot, I am! Groot......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Twice",8,1,2,15 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Lots of fun, not quite as good as the original
","This movie is a lot of fun. It brings back most of the things that made the first film so enjoyable, including lovable characters, great humor, action and amazing music. I would say that this sequel probably has even more humor and laugh out loud moments than the first. Also, baby Groot just puts a smile on your face every second he's on the screen. However, parts of the movie just seemed a bit too overblown and it felt like it was maybe 10 minutes too long. I'm all for long movies, but that third act just seemed to go on a bit longer than it needed to and the non-stop barrage of special effects action was kind of exhausting by the end. At least that's the feeling I got while watching. Maybe that would change on a second viewing. Anyway, I did enjoy this movie a lot, but it didn't quite stand up to the overall experience of the original.7/10************SPOILERS************Recommended for those that enjoy more of K-Billy's super sounds of the 70's, hot shot renegade smart alecks with big hearts, planets with big brains, daddy issues, sibling rivalries, complicated family trees, green is the new black, gold is the new white, literal interpretations of the spoken word, emotionally unstable talking space rodents, dancing baby talking space plants, robo-space-hookers, man/planet hybrids, this is your life mannequin reenactments... ...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once",7,1,4,15 May 2017
Wonder Woman," Very entertaining, well made superhero epic
","I was not looking forward to this movie at all. The first three DC Extended Universe films were all poor entries into the superhero genre. I can't say that I enjoyed any of them. Batman V Superman was OK, I guess. It had some good things mixed with a lot of crap. One of the positives being Wonder Woman. I thought Man of Steel and Suicide Squad were both pretty crappy. Based on this track record, I was not in a rush to see Wonder Woman and kind of forgot it was even coming out. Then I saw some online buzz from some sources I trust indicating that this film was actually really good. So I decided to go see it and I'm glad I did. This was a very entertaining, well made superhero epic. I felt the pacing of the movie was great, taking time to develop the characters and the world they inhabit. Most of the action sequences were very well done. Also, the film does a great job of incorporating humor without feeling forced. I think this movie was pretty successful at making me buy into the mythology, which could have come across as too silly, even for a superhero movie. My least favorite of the Marvel films are the Thor standalones, mostly for that reason. The only real negatives I had were with the less than compelling villains and the big CGI fight sequence at the end. I've kind of grown tired of the big laser, lightning, fireball exploding green screen fight sequences in these movies. I enjoyed the more, literally, grounded, well choreographed hand to hand, sword, arrow, gun battles that came earlier in the movie. Overall, if you like fun fantasy adventure films, you'll probably enjoy this movie quite a bit.8/10************SPOILERS************Recommended for those that enjoy strong kickass female characters, Xena Warrior Princess Island, Captain James T. America, gas sniffing German Bane, German mad scientists, phantom of the opera mouth, crotch grabbing, lie detecting lassos, awkward pillow talk, rag tag teams of misfits, female vs male, female vs bullet, female vs gun turret, female vs tank, female vs top of building......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once",7,4,10,5 June 2017
