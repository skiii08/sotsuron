Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I have left the movie theater before the last chapter
","Nothing, not even the dark humor of From Dusk Till Dawn, the cool Killer from Pulp Fiction,  nothing was catching, interesting, funny, breathtaking there was simply nothing there. An annoying Urma - and yes I had a Ninja Shaolin training - what was actually her problem eating with the chopstick? the missing central heating? - and am crying like a child because someone is going to bury me but he just gave the choice between the lamp and the gas even a Van Dame or a Stalone is looking smarter in this type of situations.Part of the worth film that I have seen. 1/10",Null,0,1,3 May 2004
