Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I cried when I heard the music!
",I'm a huge Star Wars fan and have greatly anticipated this movie.  I wasn't disappointed in this movie at all.  I was surprised that Samuel L. Jackson wasn't in this movie more with all the hype about him being in it.  I LOVED Darth Maul.  He was a great villain.  Senator Palpatine played great sleaze. I'm ready for the next 2 movies!!!,Null,0,0,21 May 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Too long!
","I saw this move pretty late at night and I don't know if I was in the wrong frame of mind to watch this movie but I thought that they were trying to do too much in one movie. Too many plot lines, too many characters, however interesting they may be, too many story lines. My main problem with this movie is the length. 150 minutes is a long time for any movie, but especially one of this nature. This has huge entertainment value, in other words people come to see this movie for fun. It loses much of that due to some slow parts during the movie. Possible I need to watch the first movie again to get into the spirit. However the effects of Davy Jones and his crew are impressive.",6,2,4,13 July 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," This movie shows Tarantino's growth as a director and writer (slight spoiler)
",I am thoroughly impressed with Tarantino's growth as a writer and director and liked his homage to the martial arts genre.  The anime was a nice added touch.  My only complaint is having to wait until February to see volume 2. This movie is by far Tarantino's finest.,10,0,0,10 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," This is my very favorite movie!! Bobafett is my favorite character
","I love this movie dearly.  We find out Darth Vader is Luke's father, Han and Leia get together, and Boba Fett makes his appearance.  Let's not forget the wonderful Cloud City, Bespin, is first shown.",10,1,2,2 October 1998
