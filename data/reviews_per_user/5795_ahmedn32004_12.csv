Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A great action movie but not a great Holmes one
","This movie is amazing.... and I would have given it a 10 rating only if it was the same movie without the Sherlock Holmes character I mean it is a great action movie but lacks the deduction parts of Sherlock Holmes I mean if you counted them in this movie they will be less than 4 or 5 deductions. And I didn't expect that from a Holmes movie. So, I rated it 8 because it is really good: full of chases and actions and fights. Of course, I recommend watching it but I still insist on my opinion that this shouldn't be a Holmes movie. The first part of this movie was a far exciting than this one because the deductions were many and amusing. But the effort done in this one is pretty good too.",8,0,1,10 May 2012
Requiem for a Dream," A very good drama , but a lot of sexuality and nudity
","For people who love emotional, passion and tragedy films, this is movie is the one. A movie full of society problems with drugs, old aged people and family. You may cry at the end of this movie. it is very affecting. The only problem with it that it is full of nudity and sexual scenes. And not a partial nudity, it contains scenes for full naked bodies. So, I was disappointed because I cannot recommend it to family members because of this. But my full and final rating that the movie is very good and the acting was the best. Especially the old woman character in the movie. Ellen Burstyn played her role perfectly and she was very persuasive. You may think for a moment that this is her real character.",9,0,2,6 January 2012
The Hangover," Hilarious Movie
","The Hangover is a very good comedy movie. I spent almost all the movie time laughing. This one will make you laugh till you fall on your back. I can rate it one of the best comedy movies in history. . A group of friends meets many situations in which they act, think and talk some comedy. I didn't laugh this much a long time ago. I loved every second of the movie. and I'm ready to watch it again and again and again and I'm sure I will not be bored. All the four characters are amazing in this film. They played their roles very professionally. So, if you want a good comedy movie, this is the one you are looking for. As I can see (in the moment I wrote this review) it has a rating of 7.9 and I'm sure it deserves more than that. I rated it 10 stars as I love comedy movies especially good ones like this.",10,2,3,9 November 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Very Awful and Horrible movie
","This movie is the worst one I saw in my entire life. I watched it from the first moment to the last and still didn't understand anything of it. This movie is Crap. Please don't waste your time watching it. I'm very disappointed of this high rating it took on IMDb. What happened to the people? I mean this one takes 7.8 and a movie like 'The Three Musketeers' takes only 6?????!!!!!! C'mon people for God's sake. The acting is very poor, the story is very poor, everything is poor in this movie. I REALLY didn't understand anything in the story. I hope this review of mine will help you avoid wasting your time on this crap. I regret on every moment I wasted on this. I cannot say more because I spent most of the time trying to figure out what is going on. I even didn't know how the movie ended.",1,5,13,13 January 2012
Horrible Bosses," Amazing Movie

Bad Teacher," What the **** is this?
","I love Cameron Diaz. I really do. But this? What actually this is? I can't consider this as a comedy movie. Comedy movies should ALWAYS end up with a good end. I expected that Diaz will end by being a good person and confessing all her crimes including those against the good teacher who was unfairly accused by using drugs and was transferred to another school leaving her friends. I expected her to return that stolen glass dolphin statue and to give her students some real lessons. But who the a.....e who made up that end? Which comedy movie on earth would end up by the evil wins and the good pays the price? I can accept that in Action, Sci-Fi or Horror Thriller movies, but not in a comedy movie. It's like 'The Truman Show' ending up with Jim Carry couldn't get out of that artificial city and still stuck in it for whole his life.",6,2,6,7 September 2012
The Conjuring 2," Good movie bu lacking attention to details
","I liked the movie, the story, the acting, ..... etc. But the only thing annoyed me was that the direction was not that good. Two things made me say that. There is a scene where it rains on the road concrete where there was a small pond of water from earlier rain. When it started raining, it was pretty obvious that the rain was covering most of the pond not all of it which gives away the fact that this is just 'artificial rain'. Yeah we know artificial rain is the most used rain in movie industry but it cannot look like artificial rain. The thing is I wasn't paying attention and still I noticed it which is bad. The other thing is I know movies based on true stories always have additional details for the sake of drama. But the director and the authors should pay attention to details. I mean the demon was so scared from the small cross in Ed's hand but he is totally OK and jumping around in a small room full of (at least) tens of crosses with different sizes. It was even moving them around the wall. This was just ridiculous to me. Being a true story this leaves me with the certainty that only one of those two contradicting facts have actually happened in the real story.The movie had some other minor directing faults that shouldn't have gone under the radar of a professional director.",6,1,2,19 October 2016
The Hangover Part II," Another Hilarious Part
","I made a review on the first part 'The Hangover' and I said it was a hilarious one. This time I say that this one is very hilarious too. And I'm ensuring on this because at the time I'm writing this review it has a rating of 6.8 !!!!!!!!!!!! WHY!!!!!! I mean people say that it is the same story!!!!!! SO WHAT? The three parts of Matrix were the same story,,, the three parts of transforms were the same story,,, the five parts of Fast and the furious were almost the same story.... the three parts of transporter were the same story. I like to show the difference between two major types of movie stories: 1- A story that can not be repeated like most of the movies (King Kong, Crank, Memento, The Matrix, The three musketeers, ...etc) I mean they cannot be made in another series of movies (they still can be remade of course).... 2- A story that can have infinite parts like (Final Destination, The Hangover, ...etc) I mean when Final Destination had 5 parts with the same story why didn't you people reject it? This is the same situation here, We have a story that can have an infinite number of movies with different scenarios.Finally, This movie is as great and comedy as the first part and I'm eager to see the third part.If you want to die of laughter, watch this one.Thanks",10,4,6,9 November 2011
3 Idiots," The best Indian movie ever
","To be brief, THIS IS THE BEST Indian MOVIE EVER CREATED..... I know it is old but I just heard about it recently so I watched it yesterday. I think this movie should be one of the best 250 films in history on IMDb rating. I rated it 10/10 and believe me it worth more than this. I don't want to make spoilers in my review so that you will enjoy every minute of the movie. This movie is 2:44 hours length full of laughter, joy, tears, drama and passion. And of course, the most interesting part of the movie is GENIALITY. I loved every moment of this movie. and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this. I'm also waiting for Ferrari Ki sawari movie to watch. It is starred by one of the 3 idiots. Thank you India for giving us this brilliant movie.",10,41,65,15 January 2012
Limitless," Amazing Idea
","My friends recommended me this movie, but in fact what encouraged me to watch it was Bradley Cooper. I like this man. This movie worth every minute of watching. The brilliant about this movie is the story. A new way to make the mind work 100% full power. It showed us a lot of possibilities about what can be 'The Full Power' of a human mind. I read about these stuff every now and then, but I didn't imagine it like that. The writer who had this idea and this scenario is genius and have a lot of imagination. And also the ways Eddy handled his problems with were very interesting and smart. I mean every problem he faced, he found a quick solution for it. At last, he managed to balance his life. VERY AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!! 10 out of 10...............",10,8,11,1 December 2011
50_50," Brilliant movie
","This movie took the cancer disease problem from a perspective of a real story and made a good affecting film that will make you cry at the end. This is one of the few movies that made me really cry. The acting was super good. The most wonderful character in this movie was Anna Kendrick. She was very cute and acting very professionally. Another good part of the movie that it almost talked about all the problems a cancer patient may face. I mean all the social issues like increasing love, sympathy, people making use of the patient case, betrayal and loyal people. I recommend this movie for you if you like these types of movies. I rated it 10/10 and it does worth it.",10,0,0,14 January 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The best part of the three
","This movie is AWESOME. I actually don't know why so many people are criticizing the movie this bad, or why the movie is rated 6.5 only????? Every thing in the movie elements is fantastic (ie. Graphics, fights, story, acting and production)In my opinion, the hero of this movie is 'Garrett Warren' the fight choreographer (and if there are more). The fights are amazing and very very exciting. Those men have really shown their creativity in designing the fights' moves. especially for 'Bumble Bee' and 'Optimus' fights.The Special Effects are very amazing and crazy. The graphic designs are perfect. The music of the movie is really great. I still can't understand why people didn't like the movie !!!!!!!!",10,16,24,27 October 2011
