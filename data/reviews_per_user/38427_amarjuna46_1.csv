Iron Man 3," Below my Expectations !!!!!
","Director Shane black on his second outing with Robert Downey Jr. takes you for fun ride giving you a Action packed, Humorous ,Smart and Jaw dropping experience.the movie is full fun with eye popping visuals and catchy dialogues.This movie focuses on tony stark's personal life and his vendetta with Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce ) who plays the antagonist and his relation with Maya Hansen.all the actors justify their their roles.Although the movie runs on its clever direction and screenplay and really give you fresh feel ,somewhere round the corner you start feeling the movie to be clumsy and being dragged.The story line could have been better and gives you a feeling that this movie was a WASTED OPPORTUNITY .This movie could have been a lot better.It is surely not a movie you will go and watch again,but a single viewing with surely be full of fun.ON COMPARISON WITH DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY ( THIS IS FOR FAN BOYS ) :Honestly iron man 3 would never match near any of the Nolan's trilogy ,but it would be highly inappropriate to compare iron man 3 with them.This is the first time Hollywood is making iron man trilogy,where as batman has already been made more than half a dozen times.Fan boys must note that dark knight had an ensemble star cast and a very good director,where as ironman 3 had an inexperienced director .had iron man been made with a experienced director it would have been a lot better. AFTER WATCHING DARK KNIGHT PEOPLE EXPECT OTHER SUPER HERO MOVIES TO BE IN IT,S FLAVOR BUT IRON MAN IS SURELY A FRESH NEW FEEL.WHY WATCH IT : SMART, HUMOROUS,AND FUN.WHY NOT CATCH IT : YOU BEING A BATMAN FAN BOY.",8,0,1,14 May 2013
