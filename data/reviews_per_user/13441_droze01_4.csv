The Incredible Hulk," Not so incredible
","Not so incredible. I was anxious to see The Incredible Hulk because of the ratings on IMDb and the trailers looked intriguing. Perhaps due to high expectations, the movie left me expecting much more.If you want to see a good super hero flick, see The Dark Knight  a superior show in every respect. Although Iron Man was not as good as the Dark Knight, it was also substantially better than this movie.While the movie did not get off to an overly poor start, it quickly lost its footing. It became slow during the sappy portions of the film. While I generally like Liv Tyler, I found her miscast in this movie. She just does not strike me as the academic type.The movie wasn't all bad. Edward Norton was good as always. I also thought Tim Blake Nelson had a semi-interesting role.Is this really worth a 3? Maybe a bit higher, but I wanted to add some balance with regards to most of the other ratings this movie has received.",3,4,7,16 September 2008
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A spectacular movie
","With the ever-growing number of poorly construed movies out there, it is great to be surprised when a movie is so much better than you expect. When I saw this movie, staring Emma Watson of Harry Potter fame, I wasn't expecting anything overly spectacular. I was wrong.The movie extended far beyond what could have been a run-of-the-mill, coming of age movie, to a thought provoking look into some of the challenges that face young adults as they work their way through high school. The movie takes you through a number of highly relevant issues in an intelligent way, with very good acting. It looks at early relationships, homosexuality, mental illness, bullying, and sexual abuse as well as our concepts of self-worth.This was a wonderful movie. One of the best I have seen in a long time.",10,1,2,4 February 2013
The Dark Knight," It is that good!
","I was beyond shocked to go to this movie and have it live up to the hype. Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was how good Heath Ledger was in this movie. I expected his death to be playing a major part in the reviews I have heard regarding his performance. That is not the case; he was great in this flick. My wife even liked it, and I have to drag her out to films like this.Does this movie deserve a 10 out of 10? No. I would only rate it that highly if it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. However, in the sea of mediocrity that has pervaded the movies over the last couple of years, this movie clearly stands out as a must see.",9,6,14,11 August 2008
In Time," Great start, decent follow-through.
","As others have said, the idea of this movie was excellent. You could call it a skeptical analogy of what is happening in some parts of the world – the richest people of the planet abusing poor.What I liked about the movie, especially in the early stages, was how much the movie made me think. It was also bizarre to think of what things would be like if nobody looked older than 25. The movie played upon the possibility of multiple generations would look the same age – at least for those rich enough to afford to purchase the additional years. The story was also well thought out in relation to how people would act within the differing classes of society: the rich would take their time and take few risks. The poor would treasure their time, moving quickly, and, with less to lose, would be less risk adverse.Great premise, great start to the movie, decent follow-through. Although I wish the strong start was able to be carried throughout the movie, I found this movie quite enjoyable to watch.",7,174,216,20 January 2012
