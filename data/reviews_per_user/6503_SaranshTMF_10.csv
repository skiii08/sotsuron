Captain Marvel," Marvel: Making films just for the heck of making films.
","Absolute garbage are the words that come to my mind after the credits rolled. I wish they spent 1/10th the budget in making a script and a storyline rather than wasting everything on un-funny, desperate, and mis-timed jokes. The whole script is a joke in itself. So are the villains. Nothing against Brie Larson. She looked badass and a perfect addition to the Avengers but Marvel killed her character. Nobody needs an oversmart, invincible, miss know-it-all heron Where's the fun in that? the fight scenes could've been the saving grace for Marvel but even they sucked to the core. The entire first half is like watching a 90s action film. The second half seemed to be picking some pace but then again wasted because of weak villains and non existent storyline. Dear Marvel, Please don't screw up the end game.",2,51,103,8 March 2019

Hugo," Dreams and imagination are often indescribable but not this time! Unfortunately an empty dream.
","story: Hugo is an orphan boy living in the walls of a train station in the 1930s in Paris. He fixes clocks and other gadgets as he learned to from his father and uncle. The only thing that he has left that connects him to his father is an automaton that doesn't work. Now here is the kind of film that divides the audience into two equal halves. The decision weather the film is good or bad depends completely on one's point of view. On one hand, it is something more than just a visual treat. It is film making at a whole new level (cinematography n vfx wise). this film is a craft that only an artist can understand. Whereas, on the other hand, it is an empty candy wrapper. It is void, null, blank, hollow and similar adjectives. Both are right according to their point of view !Unfortunately, i fall in the 2nd category......the adventure which the movie screams about is non existent. Movie just goes on at a constant pace without an iota of fluctuation. film is catastrophic in the sense that almost entire film is shot in a train station(only a part of station), repeated loops of same imagery makes one feel nauseated. Main storyline is hardly of any interest. Its just plain dull. the character of HUGO and Isabella are unlikable and underdeveloped. they just lacks the punch. Its like gazing into an A4. In simple words 'it is boring as hell' ! For the storyline part, it is in 2 parts. (spoilers) 1st part is the first three lines of this review. 2nd part is about a depressed and broke film maker who want to forget about his past. Had the film is about only the 2nd part, i would have given it a 10/10 and maybe entitle it as a masterpiece. Trust me It was that good ! Apart from that, probably the best ever looking film i'v seen in last 3- 4 years. Visuals, art direction, cinematography -> every single frame is speechless stuff. It is beautiful! like an imagery which forms in your mind when you read a novel or a story book....something that can't be expressed practically. I can go on and on about it but that would only make this review long. best characters: station inspector and Georges melies(film maker). For me, it is epitome of beauty and i can't imagine a more beautiful movie than this one. I Bow before you Sir. Scorsese, you will always be the greatest director ever born on earth.Apart from that, as i said, It is an empty candy wrapper ! ps: went in with no expectations and presumptions. Unadulterated review !",5,4,7,25 February 2012
Dunkirk," Average at best. Over-hyped unnecessarily.
","The film is about an unacknowledged story of WW2 where 400000 men, on a beach, were struggling to survive. Movie shows that despite large in number but still helpless to fight, 300000 soldiers were rescued off the beach by civilians. And instead of getting booed for their cowardliness, they were respectfully welcomed in their homeland. Basically showing a fresh perspective on war that sometimes survival is also a victory. The moment you walk out of theater, you will forget the film. No strong characters, unnecessary time line shifts to show a straightforward story made me loose interest in the film. IT IS JUST AN ORDINARY FILM. What could've made it interesting? A focus on how the French sacrificed a lot as an allied force knowing that only 30,000 can survive and British were the first preference. A focus on why only 30,000 soldiers could be saved. This is an interesting one. The water at the beach was very shallow and only one ship could sail ashore at a time during high tide (every six hours or so). A proper background of the events that led to 4000000 soldiers stranded on the beach. It was one of the most clever plan by Germans to make them helpless. Leaflets were thrown (start of the film) asking the french to look at the map. They are surrounded by German army on the front and ocean on the back. There is no way but surrender. However the french saw the shallow ocean as an opportunity to escape ad survive. All these details are missing.",6,19,32,23 July 2017

The Departed," great plot and twists and strong direction
","PLOT - a men from Police and an undercover agent who also works with an Irish mafia are off to find one person who is causing chaos in a happy going business.Now the twist and strength of movie lies on that the person's identity. How ???...you have to watch the movie to know the answer ;) Both of them are able to gain confidence of this mafia and are on a mission to find that person and also to take down the mafia.Saw this one last week.Its Scorsese ,so the plot has to be ridiculously complicated yet enjoyable. Its like a never ending maze.Movie becomes damn exciting after knowing who that person is :D.In entire flick,the two men were making plans and gathering info bout Irish mafia struggling to find that person who is eating the entire system from inside and causing much trouble to everyone. !st half of the movie is quite confusing and boring (as it should be) but in 2nd half things took a sharp turn and suddenly everything opens up.Its full of thrills and excitement,those guys are on their toes to catch the culprit but when they come to know the truth, they were shocked just like viewers watching the movie :D Just watch this damn thing :D.....amazing movie from another lord of directors 'Scorsese' !!!",7,1,2,24 December 2010
