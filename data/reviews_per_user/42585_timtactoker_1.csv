Requiem for a Dream," Shocking I agree but not fantastic by a long shot.
","Yeah this film was shocking and disturbing. But that's what it was supposed to do. The camera work was elaborate but did it really need to be? I think it was over elaborate, too arty and generally tried too hard to be dirty, hip and dramatic.The drug issue was not tackled all that well as I think it was overly biased towards the bad effects of drugs.  It ends up almost trivialising the matter by portraying the message Drugs are bad, do not use them. Here is what will happen to you.' Rather than simply saying Here is what can happen...'I think it could have been done a lot better and if it had then the film would be brilliant. However I came out of the cinema with the feeling that they had tried too hard, and that distracted the viewer from what could have been an excellent film.",Null,0,0,7 February 2001
