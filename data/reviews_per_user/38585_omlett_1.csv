Requiem for a Dream," Great, Heartbreaking
","I didn't know anything about this movie, before watching it (I've just finished it) ..... and I've got to say: this is the BEST MOVIE I've seen the last 3 months ;) I've seen Pi some years ago, but I had no idea it is the work of Darren Aronofsky ... that man knows how to make good movies ;) It's a heartbreaking story, and although you can figure out the ending, you keep watching it. And congratulations to the man (or woman, I don't know) who got the music for this, because that made it even ..... look, I'm out of words :) ..... the music made it even greater :) Bye.",10,0,1,14 December 2004
