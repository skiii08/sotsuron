Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A hit and miss comedy
","I admit that I really expected to loath this movie as I had seen a few clips and wasn't impressed at all.I didn't loath it but I also certainly didn't love it either.It is very hit and miss so far as comedy goes but it did at least make me laugh a few times.The parts that worked for me were the scene with the feminist's.Boy,did they take themselves seriously!Baron Cohen obviously focused on this and just had to take the Mick and it was genuinely funny.The naked wrestling was quite funny at first but went on too long.I also liked the scene where he walked into the hotel lobby after speaking to some black dudes.Again,this was laugh out loud funny.I have to say though the when the comedy missed,it missed by a mile.Calling the coloured guy a 'chocolate face' wasn't funny or witty.It was childish and desperate.I also found the scene where he insulted a guy's wife to be cruel as you could see the hurt on her face as her husband glared at Borat.As for the scenes at the rodeo,I didn't laugh at all but boy,did it make for uncomfortable viewing.Talk about a bigot!Again,you could sense the disbelief on Baron Cohen's face as he knew he was getting movie gold.So why did the critics rave so much about this movie?Maybe they wanted to feel in touch with a modern audience,maybe they genuinely did think it was the funniest movie they had ever seen.I doubt it.So it isn't as bad as I thought it would be but it definitely isn't as brilliant as so many people would have you believe.",6,0,1,22 February 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," Saved by the ending
","At first I found this film hard going and I was even getting a little bored with it.I thought that it was trying too hard to be clever and it seemed to be going nowhere.I have to say though that the last 30 minutes or so of the film saved it from a lower mark out of 10.I won't give anything away about the plot,but it is all explained very nicely at the end and in a clever way that makes sense of all that went before.Josh Hartnett is fine in the lead role and Morgan Freeman is his usual reliable self,though I have seen him better.Ben Kingsley(I'm sorry,SIR Ben Kingsley...give me a break!!)is hit and miss as a Jewish gangster and Lucy Liu talks so fast at first the I couldn't tell what she was harping on about half the time.She does get better though.Bruce Willis does a solid job in a role that doesn't really push him.If you decide to watch this movie and are struggling a bit to care about any of the characters,stick with it.It is just about worth it.",7,2,4,15 November 2006
The Sound of Music," Well made cheese
","I honestly thought that I would never watch this film in a million years.I had seen many clips over the years and it didn't appeal at all.Then my girlfriend goes and says that she want's the DVD and I go and buy it for her birthday.My better half then insists that I watch the film with her.Of course,being the man of the house,I agree immediately.Guess what?I enjoyed the movie!!!! Of course,it is cheesy beyond belief at times.But when cheese is as well made as this it isn't really a problem.There are times when I had to stifle a chuckle.When the Mother Abbess bursts into 'Climb Every Mountain',I really struggled to take it seriously.But the story is charming,the acting is fine and the scenery is just stunning.The movie is also very well photographed with excellent lighting and fabulous interior shots.The songs don't all hit the mark,but are in general excellent.I especially liked 'The Lonely Goatherd','Do-Re-Me' and 'Edelweiss'.It has to be said though that the best thing in the movie is Julie Andrews,who shows again what a fine musical actress she was.Just as in 'Mary Poppins',she totally convinces as Maria and gives an excellent performance.She is sparky,dippy,strong and romantic and fits the role like a glove.So then,'The Sound of Music' isn't perfect.It is too long and there are cringe worthy moments.But all in all it is a fine family film with it's heart in the right place.",8,1,8,25 November 2006
Deja Vu," Boy does this try to be clever
","Sometimes you watch a movie and couldn't give a monkey's what happens to the characters.That is how I felt about this movie.It started out pretty promisingly but lost itself up it's own rear end by trying to be way too clever,so much so that it ended up bugging me.It isn't all bad.The acting is pretty solid with Denzel Washington,Val Kilmer and Jim Caviezel all giving good performances.The action scenes are decent and well staged.Then the film tries so hard to be smart,so much so in fact that it quickly becomes a pain as it shows us just how intelligent the film makers are.Hey look everybody!Denzel isn't really dead after all,he saved the passengers of the ship and also the girl that was found dead at the beginning.BIG DEAL!!!!!!!!I will not watch this movie again for the sole reason that when a film tries so very hard to make you think,you just end up wishing you had done the washing up instead.'Donnie Darko' was a cracking film that really did make you think as it sucked you into Donnie's world.'Deja Vu' is about as subtle as a sledgehammer and I won't be suffering from Deja Vu with this movie as it is an experience that will definitely NOT happen again,at least as far as I'm concerned.",5,4,9,14 May 2007
Hostel," Not horror,just one long yawn
","If ever there was a film that was designed for teenage boys ready for puberty,then this is the one.I had heard things about this movie and I wasn't very confident that I would like it at all.I wasn't wrong.Full of topless women,blokes making their way around Europe in an attempt to screw everything in sight and a batch of really annoying characters.The guy from Iceland wound me up as soon as I saw him and he wasn't the only one.Then there was the so called horror.It's just an excuse for blood and gore and isn't scary in the least.I can imagine a group of young guys watching this and having a right laugh as they gaze at the bevy of boobs and level of sicko thrills.I dunno,maybe I'm getting old,but this movie was a drag and even though the DVD I watched conked out ten minutes from the end,guess what????It didn't spoil the film at all.",3,1,2,25 November 2006
The Notebook," Cliché after cliché
","I don't have a heart of stone and I do like a bit of romance.This was a movie that I had read about on IMDb and it had many a glowing review.So why did it leave me so cold?I'll try and explain.First the good.It is generally well acted,especially Ryan Gosling and James Garner.I did think that Joan Allen gave probably the finest performance though.Mmmm,now the not so good.I found the two romantic leads to be slightly annoying,what with him hanging from the Big Wheel and lying in the road waiting for the traffic lights to change.Grow up sprang to mind.I just didn't connect at all with either of them.Then there is the cynical attempts to make the viewer sob uncontrollably.The boy's father dies(where did that spring from?).They drift apart,she meets someone else,they meet again and fall in love.I have seen this so many times that this movie just didn't offer anything different.*MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*----Then there was the ending.What the hell can we do to have the audience sobbing their hearts out?Yep,They can both die in bed together.I may seem an unfeeling oaf,but I didn't feel the slightest twinge of emotion because I could kind of guess something like that would happen.That was the major fault of this movie.There are just so many clichéd moments you can take.When emotion is done well it can work brilliantly.The endings of 'It's A Wonderful Life','Gladiator','Braveheart' or 'City Lights' are classic examples of the viewer being gradually drawn in in a very subtle way.'The Notebook' may well be a very popular movie amongst many people,it just 'aint my cup of tea.",5,1,1,28 March 2007
The Great Dictator," A brave and essential movie
","I watched this movie the other night and was surprised at just how effective it still is today.While it might not be Chaplins' finest hour,it underlines what a brilliant film maker he was.The first thing that struck me was just how quick he must have been to spot the dangerous undercurrent's of the Nazi regime and although some of the humour might not seem to be that daring by todays standards,in 1940 this film must have ruffled many feathers.Chaplin was under a lot of pressure not to make this and we should be grateful that he did.He stuck to his guns and delivers a movie of some power.The story involves a Jewish barber and a tyrant Hynkel who is obviously Hitler in disguise.Both roles are played by Chaplin and he is superb in each guise.To cut a long story short,the barber is mistaken for the dictator and this gives Chaplin the chance to deliver his plea for world peace.Make no mistake,it is definitely Chaplin speaking and not the barber.This speech has come in for much criticism over the years.It has been called naive and mawkish but I think that is a direct plea from the heart and you can't disagree with what Chaplin asks for.I personally thought that the moment that Paulette Goddards' character Hannah talks to herself hoping for an end to the suffering in the ghetto was more soppy and unconvincing.She is fine in the role although she is so obviously gorgeous before she is cleaned up by the barber.The acting in general is first rate and special mention must go to Jack Oakie as Napaloni.His portrayal is funny and hits the mark every time.There is good chemistry between Chaplin and Oakie and they looked as though they really enjoyed their scenes together.There are many scenes of brilliance on show here.Of course there is the globe segment,the final speech and Hynkel's opening speech of gibberish.One scene that impressed me especially was when the barber and Hannah escape to the rooftops and his shop is destroyed.He simply says 'There goes the barber's shop' with his back to camera.While Hannah tries to offer him words of comfort and encouragement,he stays silent and you can just sense the fight escaping from him.He looks desolate just by his body language,very impressive acting in my opinion.While many scenes may seem pretty tame,Chaplin shows a Jew getting shot in the ghetto,Hannah getting smacked in the face by a storm trooper and a public lynching.This was very daring for it's day and a credit to the sensor's for leaving these scenes in.Charlie Chaplin deserves his place in cinema history and this movie shows that he was a true master of his craft.He is up there with the greats and rightly so.",9,5,8,13 January 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," This is a mess!!
","I enjoyed the first two pirates movies although I did think that the first one was a bit overrated and the second wasn't as bad as I'd feared.This one however is definitely one POTC too far.One of the biggest problems is that they try to cram just to much into this movie.At times I didn't know what the hell was going on and I have to say that I didn't really care.There are too many scenes that just don't work including one that I will come to later which was so awful I watched through clenched fingers.The multitudes of Captain Jack Sparrows,the uninspired comedy moments,the over use of CGI,there are a lot of things wrong here.This film seems to have lost a lot of the charm that the first two had and relies far too much on gimmicks.It is also way too long by at least 30 minutes.It isn't all doom and gloom.Johnny Depp is as reliable as ever and Geoffrey Rush clearly has a ball as Barbossa.Although there is too much of it,the CGI is very well done.Oh yes,I really liked the monkey as well!One big problem here though is that Keira Knightly is very badly miscast as the tough heroine Elizabeth.This is where we come to the scene that I mentioned earlier.Yes,that's right,it's when Elizabeth gives her William Wallace speech to the pirates.It is truly dreadful and she sounds like a schoolgirl shouting in a playground.I'm not saying that Keira can't act,she most probably can.It's just that she is woefully out of place in this role and many of her tough girl scenes are just laughable.Orlando Bloom?Well,he is certainly good to look at for the girlie's but isn't the worlds greatest actor to be fair.He does look the part though.I was toying with either a 4 or 5 out of ten for this.I settled for a 5 because the monkey was so good!",5,2,3,27 February 2008
Spider-Man 3," Disappointing
","It has taken me a while to watch this third instalment of Spiderman and I can't say it was worth the wait.I found it to be definitely too long,cheesy and also a bit on the childish side.It lasts for over two hours and that is at least 20 minutes too long.One thing that I have never been convinced about with these Spidey films is the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker.He comes across as just too much of a geek.His relationship with Mary Jane is also very tedious and has always slowed the films down way too much for me.It isn't all bad.Thomas Haden Church gives a fine performance as Sandman and the CGI of this character is excellent.Some of the action scenes are well done but a film needs so much more than that nowadays.I felt that the story dragged far too much at times and the scenes where Peter Parker becomes a macho man were just plain embarrassing.Maybe this is one Spiderman too many but my guess is that there will be another one.It needs to be better than this effort.",5,1,2,1 November 2007
Zodiac," Zodiac??? More like Zzzzzzodiac
","I honestly don't understand film critics at all.Films they tend to rave about generally leave me cold and a few films they have rubbished have been OK,at least to my tastes.When this film was released the critics were universal in their praise.'Brilliant','tense','gripping','superbly acted throughout'.These are just some of the phrases I remember being said about 'Zodiac'.I wonder why I found it so boring then?Firstly,it moved at a snails pace and how it can be described as gripping is beyond me.It is also way too long by at least 20 minutes.The acting?Pretty good really especially from Robert Downey Jr.The rest of the cast are alright although Chloe Sevigny looked half asleep and Anthony Edwards was fair but no better than that.He looked a bit lost at times to me.I just wanted the movie to get going and it just didn't seem to go anywhere.It is not a patch on David Fincher's other works,especially the excellent 'Seven'.This film was a major disappointment to me and I'm just glad that I didn't go to the cinema to watch it.I really don't think I would have lasted till the end credits.",5,6,12,28 September 2007
The Prestige," Clever,maybe a bit too clever..
","This was a movie that I had heard many good things about and I was looking forward to watching it. Did it live up to my expectations? If I am honest, I was slightly disappointed.The movie is stylish and very well filmed and the acting is also mostly fine. Of the two leads, Hugh Jackman is definitely better and gives probably the best performance in the movie. On reflection, Christian Bale isn't that great and his accent really seems put on and not natural. Michael Caine is fine and Scarlett Johansson is mostly OK, though she doesn't always convince. There is also a nice little cameo from David Bowie. The effects are clever and the actual story is pretty good. So why wasn't I more blown away with this film? I think that the movie relies a great deal on the twist or twists and I could kind of see them coming a mile off and this certainly diminished some of the impact. I also felt that the movie was trying too be just a little too clever at the end, trying to fit in too many twists.I didn't get ALL of them but certainly the most important ones. Obviously,I won't even hint at the outcome and it is fun trying to work out the story before it reaches it's conclusion.This is a movie worth watching but it may not live up to your expectations.",7,3,6,8 March 2007
Cloverfield," Unoriginal and annoying as hell
","Rarely have I been so bemused by comments on IMDb about a film as I have with this one.'Jaw dropping','Awesome' are just a couple of the reviews that I read.I have just watched this film and feel compelled to give it the lowest mark I have ever given.Why?Because it is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen and extremely unoriginal.Hand held camera?'Blair Witch'.Monster attacking New York?'King Kong','Godzilla'.Some of the scenes are even lifted straight from the 9/11 attacks.I got the impression that a lot of the dialogue was off the cuff and unscripted.This really didn't work at all and became irritating and poorly acted.Yes,the effects are OK but if ever a film needed more that just nice effects it was this one.It lasts less than 90 minutes but still felt way too long.It really didn't work for me on any level and don't even get me started on the first 20 minutes!Boy,what a crowd.My brother used to mess around with tapes when he was younger and try to tell spooky stories using incredibly basic sound effects.He was about thirteen at the time and this film constantly reminded me of those tapes.My brother's efforts were more original and had much better story lines.'Cloverfield' made pots of money but it is a very poor relation to many much better earth under attack movies of the past.It even rates a 7.5 on IMDbs overall score.Like I said earlier,I am completely bemused.",2,0,1,17 June 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," A dark and powerful fantasy
","Without a doubt,this was a movie that I had already assumed that I would like before I saw it.I wasn't wrong as it is a powerful and dark fantasy which was what I expected,but then again it did manage to surprise me.I will try and explain what I mean without giving away any of the plot.I vaguely knew the basic story of this movie through the reviews I had read but it certainly helped that I didn't know that much about it.So if you are kind enough to be reading my take on this movie,I won't spoil any surprises that this excellent story has in store.Firstly,I must say that the movie is beautifully filmed and it comes as no surprise that the cinematography has picked up a sackful of awards.The acting is first rate also,especially from Ariadna Gil(Carmen),Sergi Baquero(The Captain) and Maribel Verdu(Mercedes).Special mention must go to Ivano Baquero(Ofelia) who gives a compelling performance as the young girl that the story revolves around.The story is very well told and draws you in as you watch the events unfold.It has to be said that this film is very dark and is most certainly not for young children as it can be brutal at times.The effects are very good throughout and add to the quality of this fine movie.As I stated earlier,I will give nothing away about the plot.Suffice to say that the backdrop is the Spanish Civil War and the fantasy world of the young girl.This is a movie that will suck you in and leave you wondering about what you have just seen.It is a journey well worth undertaking and is a piece of film making that will stand the test of time.It is moving,sad and thought provoking.I must also mention the fabulous musical soundtrack,both haunting and descriptive.It compliment's the movie perfectly.",9,2,5,17 March 2007
We Are Marshall," Like a cup of tea with 20 sugars...YUK!!!!
","When I decided to watch this movie I guessed what it would be like and it didn't let me down.A totally over sentimental load of tripe.Firstly,I am from the UK and I don't like American Football at all.It's like looking at an olive to me.It looks promising but when you have a taste of it you realise that it's pretty awful. The fact that it was based around American Football didn't put me off .If a film is good it doesn't matter what the subject matter is.What really put me off was the way almost every scene ended up with tears welling up in eyes and then the emotional music crept in.I cannot abide movies like this which fully intend to make you cry all the time and this movie was one of the very worst of it's type.It was a truly awful experience sitting through this mush and I am amazed at some of the very positive reviews this film has had.It was tedious,tried way too hard to tug at the heartstrings and was incredibly predictable.You could almost guess every scene in the movie.Oh yes,Matthew McConaughey was really annoying in this and quite what that fine actor Ian McShane was doing in this drivel is beyond me.No wonder he looked bored stiff.I know that it is based on a true story and what happened was a tragedy on a large scale.This saccharine attempt to tell this deeply moving story failed massively because of it's attempts to grab hold of the viewers emotions in a not very subtle way.The worst film I have seen since 'Hostel' and that's saying something.I only gave this three stars because it started promisingly.Boy did it go downhill rapidly.",3,9,21,24 September 2007
Forrest Gump," Why so high in the Top 250????
","I just can't believe that this movie is rated so highly in the IMDb Top 250.I only just watched the film recently and I would't watch it again.I am definitely in the minority amongst people I know that have seen the movie.They all seem to love it.So why didn't I?I'll give my reasons.First off,it is too long and I almost gave up on it half way through.I have to say that I found Forrest Gump to be annoying as well.I know that he is supposed to be a bit slow,but getting hit in the 'ButtOCKS'(You know the way he says it!!!) and 'My name is Forrest Gump,they call me Forrest Gump' had me turning down the volume.Let's not forget 'Life is like a box of chocolates',on second thoughts,maybe we should forget about it.I have seen Tom Hanks' performance described as astounding in other reviews.He is OK,definitely not astounding.The best acting came from Gary Sinise and even then they sugar coated his character at the end.The major problem for me though was when he got it together with his lifelong girl friend.I couldn't believe how contrived this felt and the only reason it happened was to tug at the heart strings in a cynical way.She dies of course but she has given birth to Forrests' child.Boy oh boy,did they really want you to sob your heart out.It didn't work for me at all.I can feel emotional when watching a movie,'It's A Wonderful Life' gets me every time.But this type of clinical and unrealistic 'emotion' left me cold and bored.So this film is rated above 'Gladiator' is it?Not in a million years.'Forrest Gump' is often described as a heartwarming tale.Just watch it again to see how cold and manipulative it really is.",5,4,9,2 December 2006
Ratatouille," It's OK but not Pixar at it's very best best
","This movie is brilliantly made and the story is pretty good too.So why have I only given it a six out of ten?I just don't think it is Pixar at it's very best.I found the film to be a little bit too long and I even felt a bit bored after about an hour or so.There can be absolutely no doubt that there has been a hell of a lot of hard work gone on here and the makers can feel proud of their efforts.It's just that the movie didn't hold my attention too well though it did pick up towards the end.It feels a little churlish to only give such a well made film an average mark but I have to be honest and say that I would rank it below other Pixar works such as A Bug's Life,Finding Nemo and well below the two Toy Story films.It is well voiced,it looks fabulous but at the end of the day it didn't float my boat.I know there are loads of you out there that will disagree strongly with this review and I can understand that.But when you are up against the likes of Toy Story you really do have to produce something special and this wasn't it for me.",6,1,4,28 February 2008
Control," A fitting and worthwhile tribute
","As a fan of Joy Division and also hearing so many positive things said about this movie,it was with some trepidation that I watched 'Control'.So often it is the films that you really look forward to that can disappoint the most.I am glad to say that this movie is very well made and a fitting tribute to the life of Ian Curtis.Filmed in black and white,this gives the film the atmosphere needed for the subject matter.While we may all know the outcome,the ending is done with subtlety and handled in a very professional manner.The movie never tries to gloss over the darker phases of Curtis' life but there is never the slightest hint of sensationalism and you get the feeling that the story of his life is being told in an honest and accurate way.As for the acting,it is uniformly excellent throughout.Sam Riley gives a very good performance as Ian Curtis especially when he is on stage.He truly becomes the troubled singer and deserves the plaudits that he has received for this film.He could have a pretty good future ahead of him.Samantha Morton is as reliable as ever as Deborah.She shows the torment but also the love she felt for Ian Curtis in a convincing way and it is to her credit that she manages to portray a woman quite a few years younger than herself in an always truthful and honest way.I was also impressed with Toby Kebbell as the manager of Joy Division Rob Gretton.He brings humour and a touch of cynicism to the role and almost steals the movie.Actually,there aren't really any dud performances in this film at all.This is a fine film and captures the spirit of the time perfectly.Well directed,beautifully shot and a very good script.Recommended.",8,3,4,23 February 2008
No Country for Old Men," A good film but NOT a great one
","I expected a lot from this movie.Showered with awards,raved about by the critics and it looked excellent from the trailers I had seen.So what did I think?I thought it was a good movie but most definitely not a great one.I need to explain why.The film started so promisingly and had me pretty much hooked.But at the end of the movie I felt distinctly underwhelmed and that is a shame.I just felt that the ending was too open ended given what had gone on before.The acting is very good and although Javier Bardem is the one that seems to have received the most glowing tributes,I felt that Josh Brolin,Kelly Macdonald and especially Tommy Lee Jones were equally as good.The cinematography and sound are excellent and the direction by the Cohen brothers is tight and crisp.But,and it's a big but,this film promised so much and ended up feeling almost unfinished.Yes,I know a lot of you out there who are reading this will think that I don't know what I am talking about,but this is my opinion and NCFOM just wasn't as good as I expected.This isn't a terrible film by any means but the ending is pretty weak and I reckon that I'm not the only one that will think so.I won't give away any of the plot to those who haven't yet seen the movie,but there are just too many unanswered questions and more than one instance where you are left wondering just what happened.Did it deserve the best picture Oscar?I honestly can't say as I have yet to see the other contenders.I will be very surprised though if I will judge this as the best of the bunch.",7,2,8,4 March 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Too long and way too slow
","This is one of those movies that so many people on this web site absolutely love.I have read many of the reviews posted about this movie and find myself in disagreement with most of them.It isn't all bad but I will try and explain just why I can only give this film a five out of ten score.Firstly,I will admit that the cinematography here is fabulous.A really great job was done on the look of this movie.Also,the acting is pretty good throughout although I think that the praise that Casey Affleck(Robert Ford) has garnered has been overplayed.He is good but not brilliant.In his early appearances in the movie he tries too hard to be the naive and slightly odd youngster and his voice is grating.You can just tell he is acting.He is much better later on as he becomes a more cynical character.But it must be said that there are other actors here that are just as impressive especially Garret Dillahunt(Ed Miller) and Sam Rockwell(Charley Ford).Also impressive is Sam Shephard(Frank James),who is very much underused.Brad Pitt is fine as Jesse James.Not an award winning performance but he is OK.Now I come to the two biggest problems.The film is way too long and also way too slow.There are just too many times when the pace drags almost to a stop and there doesn't appear to be anything going on at all.I have no problem at all with films almost three hours in length if they hold the attention.'Godfather 1 & 2','The Good,The Bad & The Ugly' and 'Once Upon A Time In The West' are all wonderful movies simply because the stories are so compelling.They are involving and the pace moves towards a gripping conclusion.With 'The Assassination Of Jesse James' the pace flags too often and by half way I was losing patience and interest.I have read reviews where people have compared this to the films of Sergio Leone.Don't make me laugh!It comes nowhere near to the tension,the sheer drama his westerns can muster.Many people will think my review is a load of rubbish but I stick by it as this is a ponderous movie.Great to look at maybe but a journey that will most definitely make you saddle sore.",5,0,3,23 October 2008
Transformers," A total blast
","Every now and again there comes a movie that you don't expect to like at all and then it goes and surprises you.'Transformers' was a real shock to me as I have never been a follower of the cartoon series and the trailers I had seen didn't do much for me.The simple truth here is that I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to.It is pretty much action all the way here and the movie very rarely let's up.It is perhaps a touch too long but it never really feels as though it drags at any time.The acting is pretty good and Shia LaBeouf does a good job in the lead role as he shows humour and a serious side when he has to.There were a couple of moments when I was worried that things were going to get too cheesy but luckily the action soon kicked in again.Also,there were genuinely funny moments and the film didn't seem to take itself too seriously,that would have been a BIG mistake.The direction is crisp and Michael Bay deserves credit for such an entertaining ride.There will be many people that will turn their noses up at this movie as just a brainless action flick but that does the film an injustice when it is as well done as this.The effects are brilliantly done and I recommend this film to anyone with an open mind.My mind was already made up before I watched it and the film proved me wrong.",8,21,40,29 February 2008
The Dark Knight," A good solid effort
","Walking into the cinema to watch 'The Dark Knight' I so wanted to award it a 10 when I walked out as so many people have done on IMDb.Batman has always been my favourite superhero by a mile and when I saw that it had soared to No.1 in the top 250 my hopes were raised considerably.I guess that the whole idea of writing reviews is to be totally honest and I can't give this fine film the maximum mark.I think it is about an 8.3.It is a good film,there is no doubt about that but it isn't the best film I have seen this year although it deserves a lot of praise.Why not a 10 or even a 9?I think it is a bit too long and it dragged ever so slightly at times.I must admit that I found the voice Batman used to be a little too gruff and he sounded like the guy who does the Carlsberg ads.The character of Two Face didn't have time to develop enough in order to show his switch from upstanding citizen to murderous psycho.These are pretty minor niggles compared to the movie as a whole though.Christian Bale is fine as Batman(apart from the gruff voice!) and is pretty much making the part his own.Michael Caine is solid as Alfred and Morgan Freeman is his usual reliable self as Lucius.I thought that the most forgettable character was Rachel as played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.It isn't her fault as she is fine in the role but her character was easy to forget,at least for me.The most surprising performance came from Aaron Eckhart.He did very well as both Harvey Dent and Two Face and he was better than I expected.The honours for acting in this movie are tied between Heath Ledger as The Joker and Gary Oldman as Gordon.Ledger is very good although I still believe that the best performance I have seen this year is Daniel Day Lewis in TWBB.That is a hard act to follow and Heath Ledger's performance doesn't match that although to hear some people it is the best performance ever!This is where I must praise Gary Oldman who is excellent here.Never overshadowed by anyone he shares a scene with,he is the equal of Ledger and gives a performance of poise and class.With many very good action scenes and some fine acting,there is a hell of a lot to enjoy here.On second viewing this movie may well creep up towards a 9 but for now it is a rock solid 8.",8,2,6,4 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Another entertaining addition
","The fifth film in the Harry Potter series was always going to be the one that could have been a problem in my opinion.I say this because the book 'Order of the Phoenix' was very long and there were parts of it that were drawn out too much although it was still a good read.I am happy to report that I feel that the film makers got it just about right with what they left out of the book and left in the film.I won't bore you with the plot as you probably know it already.Needless to say,the special effects are very good and the final face off between Lord Voldemort and Dumbledore is very well done and creates just the right level of tension and,importantly,it isn't overblown to the point of being ridiculous.The story flows pretty well although some of it does seem a little rushed at times.Acting wise,Daniel Radcliffe gives his best performance yet as Harry.I also felt that Emma Watson was back to her best as Hermione.Rupert Grint wasn't really given that much to do to be honest and the same applies to Emma Thompson,Brendan Gleeson,David Thewliss,Alan Rickman,Julie Walters,Maggie Smith and Ralph Fiennes.It must be said that they are all very good with what they had to do.As for the newcomer's,Imelda Staunton scored as Dolores Umbridge and clearly had a ball playing her.Young Evanna Lynch does well as Luna Lovegood although she didn't always convince.Helena Bonham Carter makes a great impression as Bellatrix Lestrange but she only appears late on.I do feel that the best performance came from Gary Oldman as Syrius Black.He really seemed to become the character and I was impressed with the way he acted with just his facial expressions.He was very good in this,just as he usually is.This is an entertaining movie in it's own right and keeps the epic tale of Harry Potter ticking along nicely.",7,1,1,9 August 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Didn't deserve the battering it got
","I was almost put off going to see this film as it received such savage reviews from the critics.Some of the reviews were terrible.Anyhow,having read the book I thought that I would go to the cinema and make up my own mind.I was pleasantly surprised.The film was pretty faithful to the book although some parts of the story weren't properly explained.The actor's were all fine and fit their roles very well apart from maybe Audrey Tautou who looked a little bewildered at times and seemed to struggle.Special mention must go to the music which complimented the film well.Also Ron Howerd deserves credit for his taut direction and he didn't deserve the kicking many critics gave him.The film is an enjoyable thriller which I have now seen twice and enjoyed both times.So why were so many critics so harsh?Dunno,maybe they are a very religious bunch that didn't wan't people to go and see the movie.Check it out,it really isn't as bad as you may think.",8,2,4,9 November 2006
The Departed," Well acted and directed but NOT Scorsese's best
","When this movie started I thought that it was going to be great.The way the lives of the two rookie cops were intertwined was very well done initially and I was definitely hooked.Gradually though,as the film wore on,I realised that I was clock watching a little and had lost a bit of interest.Why?Tough to explain but I'll try.The acting is pretty much first rate with Matt Damon(Colin Sullivan)particularly impressive.I thought that Vera Famiga(Madolyn)gave a very nice performance also.Every one else was fine,there were no duff performances.I started to have a problem with the movie when Madolyn two timed her boyfriend with Billy.This seemed very contrived and it didn't convince me at all.I also felt the movie was a little too long and the music was a bit overpowering at times.It is a good film,but certainly not a great one.No one can begrudge Martin Scorsese his Oscar,he certainly deserved to win one at some stage.But I would most definitely put 'Goodfellas','The Aviator','Taxi Driver' and the one he should certainly have won for 'Raging Bull'above this.It is a clichÃ©d sort of a film and I thought that it got a bit crazy at the end when almost everybody was getting shot in the head!When I came to mark this movie I couldn't decide to give it a 7 or an 8.I then wondered if I would want to watch it again and I can't honestly say that I would.So,by no means a bad movie but definitely not Mr. Scorsese at the very peak of his powers.",7,3,6,30 March 2007
There Will Be Blood," An instant classic and a performance of extraordinary power
","I have read many reviews of 'There Will Be Blood'on the IMDb pages.Many have called the film one big bore while several have said that Daniel Day-Lewis overacts.I think that these people are wrong in a very big way as this is a film that will stand the test of time with a performance by Day-Lewis that will rank amongst the very best in years to come.This is a long movie at around two and a half hours but it never seemed to drag at all.It can be argued that it is a story about greed versus the church,but I thought it was more of a character study of one man and his dreams,passion and drive.The direction by Paul Thomas Anderson is excellent throughout and he gets the best out of all of his actors.A special word must be said about the cinematography which is superb.As mentioned,the acting is pretty much first rate and Paul Dano does a fine job as Eli Sunday although at times he does seem a little young for the role.The story is very well paced and although not exactly action packed it is never boring despite what so many people say.I wasn't too sure about the soundtrack at times but gradually it did win me over and suited the mood of the movie.Now we come to the lead role and it may take me some time to write about this so please bear with me.I'll start a new paragraph as it is a performance that needs a section all of it's own.Daniel Day-Lewis is nothing short of sensational here and it is the finest performance I have seen for years.He absolutely becomes Daniel Plainview to such an extent that you forget that your are watching an actor and feel that you are watching a real character.It truly is a fantastic performance and well worth the Oscar that he won.I know that a few reviewers have called his performance theatrical and over the top especially towards the end of the movie but believe me they are completely wrong.It is acting of the very highest order and Day-Lewis convinces in absolutely every scene that he is in.Towards the end of the movie we see a man who has aged and become very bitter with strong hints that he is verging on the brink of insanity.It is played beautifully.The character of Daniel Plainview is a complex one as at times he is tender,arrogant,frightening and desperate.Make no mistake here,Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance of such raw power that this role will be talked about in years to come as one of the very best in cinema,it is that good.Just watch the scene where he kneels for forgiveness in church and see him wince due to the pain in his leg.It is simple but brilliant.'There Will Be Blood' is a very good film and the only reason that I haven't given it a 10 is because I think a movie needs more than one viewing before you can give it a maximum mark.When I watch it again it may well hit that 10 mark.I have seen 'No Country For Old Men' and consider TWBB to be by far the better film.It deserves to be in the top 30 and in time may very well approach the top 10.Don't listen to the negativity and watch this film with admiration and for a performance that just may be one of the best ever.",9,3,7,6 March 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman is great but this is over hyped
","Batman has always been my favourite superhero and I thought that the first two movies in this franchise were very good. It was almost a shock to me then that when I finished watching 'The Dark Knight Rises' I felt a sense of disappointment. All of the reviews I had read or heard rated this as a brilliant movie but unfortunately for me, it didn't impress me anywhere near as much as I thought it would and obviously I need to explain why;THE BAD; Despite a pretty good opening section, the movie took too long to get going and I actually felt bored at some points. The movie is too long, definitely. At least twenty minutes could be trimmed from this. Catwoman. I love her character but I couldn't even see why she had to be in this movie and a couple of her scenes with Batman were cringe worthy. She should have had a Batman movie where she was the main villain and this felt like padding to me. I wasn't 100% convinced that Anne Hathaway was right for the part, she was OK but that's about all. I see that plenty of reviewer's here have singled her for praise but she isn't at the top of my Catwoman list, that's for sure. I also didn't think that the relationship between Batman and Catwoman worked particularly well, indeed it's the least convincing I have seen and I include the Adam West version in that statement! A couple of scenes featuring Alfred and Batman were cheesy to say the least and not that brilliantly acted.THE GOOD; The closing forty minutes or so were very well done and quite gripping. The twist towards the end was good and I didn't see it coming. The acting is generally good especially from Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy and Christian Bale. Some of the settings look fabulous and the music fits the mood perfectly.'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't a bad movie but it isn't a great one either. I fully expect to get ripped to pieces for this review but it is honest and I still think that 'Batman Begins' is the best of the three.",5,4,9,24 July 2012
Casino Royale," Not bad but not as great as the critics said.
","I finally got to watch this movie last night after several of my mates had been raving about it being the best Bond film ever.Mmmmmm,so why wasn't I blown away with it?The first thing I have to say is that,as with so many movies nowadays,it is definitely too long by at least 20 minutes.If it had lasted about 110 minutes or so it would have been so much better.I must admit that the action scenes are very well done and the movie is great to look at with several gorgeous locations.The story isn't too bad,it just takes a long time to reach it's conclusion.The acting?For the main characters I rated Daniel Craig(James Bond)as very good,Mads Mikkelsen(Le Chiffre) as good,Eva Green(Vesper Lynd) as no more than average with an accent that seemed to alter in several scenes.She didn't convince me as a Bond girl I'm afraid.I have to say also that I found Judi Dench(M) a bit wooden and I have felt that in all of her performances as M so far.I guess the main talking point here is does Daniel Craig cut it as Bond.I have to say the the stick he got for taking on the role was ridiculous and good for him that he put in such a solid performance under so much pressure.I am still not 100% sure that he is a Bond though,but as an action hero he definitely cuts the mustard and he is the best thing in this movie.This is not a bad film but I enjoyed Terminator 3 more as an action movie because it moved at a faster pace and the length of the film was just right.I know a lot of people will give me stick for that opinion,but it is one I believe to be true.I was in a dilemma about what score to give this,a 6 or a 7.I finally decided on 7 because Daniel Craig deserves praise for a convincing performance of a character that I am still not sure really suits him.",7,1,3,12 May 2007
La Vie En Rose," A fabulous central performance
","It is always a pleasure when a movie more than lives up to expectations and this one was definitely better than I expected it to be.I didn't know too much about Edith Piaf apart from the fact she was French and had the nickname 'the little sparrow'.I was shocked when I realised just what an eventful life she had and it is told in a very convincing way.There is an excellent atmosphere throughout and it acted supremely well.Gerard Depardieu is impressive in a relatively small role and Emmanuelle Signor is very good as Titina,a prostitute that cares for a young Edith.I have been critical of her in the past but have to eat humble pie here as she proves what a fine actress she is.But the movie belongs to Marion Cotillard as Edith.She is quite simply brilliant,especially as Edith is hurtling towards the end of her life.Around the time of the Oscars I was spouting that Cate Blanchett should win best actress for her part as Elizabeth in 'the Golden Age'.As much as I think she was great in the movie,I now believe that the academy got it right in awarding the best actress gong to Marion Cotillard.It truly is a performance to remember.This is a fine film.Moving,well directed and very well made.Don't let the fact that it is subtitled put you off in any way as dubbing would have probably ruined it.Nine out of ten and richly deserved.",9,1,3,28 June 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," The finest actress of her generation
","The above comment of course refers to the wonderful Cate Blanchett.I have seen this movie today and once more find myself at odds with the many people who seem to have hated this movie.I can't understand this but I guess that is what makes IMDb such an interesting site.So many differences of opinion plus the chance for all of us to become reviewers.For what it's worth,these are the things that I wasn't so keen on in this film.It isn't historically accurate but that didn't bother me too much.I wanted to be entertained and not given a history lesson although I did learn quite a lot.The story did drag slightly at times and I felt that the battle scenes at the end were rushed,although they were very well done.I would say that the first movie 'Elizabeth' was better but that was a hard act to follow.A good job has been made of this sequel and it definitely is a worthy follow up.What impressed me was the quality of the acting with Geoffrey Rush,Clive Owen,Samantha Morton and Abbie Cornish all giving fine performances.It was a pity that Rhys Ifans wasn't used more as he was impressive in his role.The cinematography was excellent and the musical score was well suited to the movie.It must be said though that the movie belongs to Cate Blanchett who once again shows what a fabulous actress she is.She has a wonderful screen presence and I could't take my eyes off her whenever she was on screen regardless of who's she was acting with at the time.She probably won't win an Oscar for this film but she should do.I can't think of anyone that could have given such a commanding performance and this movie would be so much less without her.So 'Elizabeth:The Golden Age' isn't a perfect movie,but there is enough about it that is right and it is well worth watching.Plus there is Cate and that is reason enough to give this 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,6 November 2007
Munich," Well made but overlong
","This was a movie that I really didn't know what to expect.I knew the basic story and also knew that it was based on fact,but I hadn't felt the need to watch it as the trailers had left me cold.Was it worth seeing in the end?Yes,it probably was.But it isn't one of those films that I could watch over and over again.The things that I liked about this film was the level of tension that was built up before each 'revenge' mission.They are all dealt with very well and are also well staged.The acting is also fine with no dud performances.What I wasn't too keen on was the length of the movie.As with many films today it was too long and could have been at least 20 minutes shorter.The main problem I had was the way the revenge gang suddenly developed a conscience towards the end.This felt forced and unconvincing and only Daniel Craig's character Steve showed very little remorse throughout.From being a clinical bunch of professional killers,too many of them changed their political viewpoint.So 'Munich' is a well made movie but no classic.Worth a watch but a slight disappointment.",7,1,4,6 January 2007
300," Gloriously over the top but I liked it!
","I have to start off by saying that this movie will never be described as subtle.It smashes you over the head like a sledgehammer.I had read pretty mixed reviews but like every other movie I have ever seen,I decided to make up my own mind.I was pretty impressed.Just about everything in '300' is over the top.The acting,the use of slow motion,the battle scenes,everything.But the thing is that it works.It will not be everyones cup of tea but it will appeal to a lot of people.I have to say that the thing that impressed me most was the overall look of the film.It looks fabulous from beginning to end.It isn't in the same league as 'Gladiator' which I have heard it compared to,but it is a fine piece of work.Just be prepared to have your senses bashed!!I think that I ended up viewing this movie as a kind of live action comic book.It IS historically inaccurate,you DO have to suspend belief at times.But I think the whole point of this movie is for it to entertain.Each scene was like turning over a page in a comic and I really do think that many people would enjoy it more if they looked at it this way.You can't take it too seriously but I still maintain that the film definitely works in the context of good looking entertainment.It is as camp as a row of tents,way over the top and a macho overdose.Ultimately though,as a piece of comic book action,it IS a film worth seeing.",8,3,7,31 March 2007
Braveheart," 'They fought like warrior poets'.
","As a piece of film making,'Braveheart' is a fabulous piece of work.Mel Gibson deserves high praise for his performance as William Wallace,his direction, and his determination to get this film made.He should be proud of his efforts as this is an epic,sweeping tale that is gripping,emotional and involving from the very start.This is the story of Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace.I am ashamed to admit that I had never heard of him until this movie but I can safely say that he is now world famous because of this film.Of course,many people have admired the man for many years,but 'Braveheart' has spread the word in a way that will ensure he will never be forgotten.There are several moments of historical inaccuracy on show here but it doesn't really matter as we are given an insight to the history of this character and we do learn quite a lot about him and the very harsh times he lived in.It is after all a movie and not a history lesson.There is an excellent cast on show here.Brendan Gleeson(Hamish) and David O' Hara(Stephen)give solid support with a few comic moments thrown in.Sophie Marceau(Princess Isabelle)and Catherine McCormack(Murron)look fabulous and handle their roles perfectly.James Cosmo(Campbell) and Brian Cox(Argyle)are impressive and Ian Bannen(Robert the Bruce Sr)holds the attention brilliantly as a corrupt man that wants the best for his son no matter what the cost.As his son,Angus Macfadyen does a great job as a man torn between what is best for his family and his country.His obvious torment is well told and well handled.I do feel though that the standout performance comes from Patrick McGoohan as King Edward 1st.He is the personification of evil and spits out his lines with relish.He really should have received an Oscar nomination for this.The cinematography is fantastic and the musical score by James Horner is worthy of the highest praise.The one thing about this movie that I was never too sure about is the romance between William Wallace and Princess Isabelle.It has always seemed a little contrived to me but it does ultimately lead to a great scene towards the end of the film concerning the dying King so in that sense it is perhaps justified.This is a fine film and Mel Gibson truly deserved the praise that was lavished upon him.I very rarely mark anything as a ten as perfection is virtually impossible in film making.But this does score 9+ and is among my top 10 movies of all time.",9,3,7,4 November 2008
Gladiator," A return to epic film making
","When I checked out the latest Top 250,I couldn't quite believe that 'Gladiator' was only ranked at No.138.It just had to be higher,especially when you consider some of the movies that are above it.I thought it would be top 20 at the very least.Why is it so low?Beats me,it truly does.This is a film that scores in every department.Great cinematography,fine acting,excellent story and genuine emotion.It is a film that has gone on to influence several films since and I dare say that a few movies wouldn't have even got made if it hadn't been for the success of this stirring adventure movie.As stated,the acting is fine throughout with Joaquin Phoenix,Connie Nielsen,Oliver Reed and Richard Harris all impressive.But this film belongs to Russell Crowe who gives a powerful performance full of compassion and turmoil.I saw a recent poll that listed the most undeserved Oscar winners and Russell Crowe came top for this performance.Now that is totally pathetic and people obviously voted for the personality and not the actor.You know and I know that there have been many other performances in recent years that have won the coveted Oscar and shouldn't have.Crowe deserved his award without any shadow of a doubt and it his role of Maximus for which he will be remembered,a fact that would probably bug the hell out of him.This film is gripping from start to finish and is one of the finest releases of recent years.No,it isn't perfect.There are too many gaffes for that.The guy wearing jeans,the gas cylinders on the chariots and the headrest for Maximus' death scene(just look at the long shot!!).But it is a cracking movie of a type so rarely seen recently.I know that it is in my top 10 movies of all time.",9,1,1,2 December 2006
Atonement," Pretty good but not memorable
","Did this movie live up to the hype?No,not really.It is a watchable film to be sure but at the end of the day I felt it was OK and nothing better than that.I won't go over the plot of the film as I am guessing that you have already watched it.It is a good story and very well filmed but I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters at all and felt no emotion throughout the film.It is nicely directed by Joe Wright although I did feel that the Dunkirk sequence was overdone and almost felt as though it was the directors way of showing how clever he was.He does do a good job overall though in fairness to him.Acting wise,James McAvoy was fine as Robbie but Keira Knightley was average at best and I am puzzled that a lot of people were pushing for her to be nominated for an Oscar.She struggled at times to show emotion and though her performance is reasonable,believe me we are NOT talking about award winning stuff here.The two best performances for me were from Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and Vanessa Redgrave as the old.They are both excellent and the best things about the film.So 'Atonement' is a pretty good watch but not for me a classic.It is one of those films that I was struggling to mark,maybe a 6 or a 7.I decided on a 6 finally because it isn't a film that I would watch again.",6,1,2,28 March 2008
V for Vendetta," Much better than I expected it to be
","I have to admit that I never really liked the look of this movie.The trailers I had seen didn't make me want to rush out and see it and I had heard a couple of bad report's about it.Anyhow,I got hold of the DVD and settled down to watch it.At first I thought that my doubts were correct.I wasn't sure at all where the story was going and wasn't convinced by Natalie Portmans' character Evie.I decided to stick with it and gradually the film sucked me in.I have always thought that Hugo Weaving was a bit hammy but to be fair he is excellent here as V.He gives a performance of power and elegance and although his face is never seen it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role.I think that it is his best ever performance.There is always a time when you are watching a movie when you can sense whether you are going to be impressed or not.The time in this film for me was when Evie is thrown in a cell and finds a letter.It is from a previous inmate,a lady who was arrested solely for being a lesbian.She gives vent to her feelings in this letter and it is very well dealt with and the story really starts to unfold.I must add at this point that my initial doubts about Natalie Portman were unfounded as she gets better as the film progresses and is very convincing towards the end.The film reminded me of Phantom of the Opera,Beauty and the Beast and 1984.But it is a film that other films will be compared with in the future and that is a fitting tribute to an impressive movie.",8,5,9,17 November 2006
