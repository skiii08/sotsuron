Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as good as the prevoius one, but is a good start for the story...
","I know Jar-Jar Binks is annoying, and the special effects were overused, but I think is a good start to the story. Once Episode II and III comes out we will understand the movie better and be able to look at it as part of a 6 episodes.I think people are being too hard calling it the worst movie ever, the expectations were too high and face it this one was better than the Return of The Jedi which the only advantage that had over this one is the fact that we knew the characters very well and we wanted the end of the Saga. I will give it a 9!!!",9,1,2,9 August 2001
