The Blair Witch Project," Boo!
","Am I the only one who has noticed that the movie is based on the Grimm brothers fairy tale 'Haensel & Gretel' (dunno what the title in English would be)?This is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen, maybe even THE scariest.  Best of all, the feelings of horror and suspense are not produced through the usual set of Hollywood techniques -- expensive SFX, overimposing sound track, and the usual plot line of 'girl / couple get killed after / while having sex'.One word of warning though:  you MUST see this film on the big screen, it just will not work if you see it on video.  I guess that is the reason why a relatively high percentage of people gave this film 1 / 10 points.  And you have to be prepared for a cinematic experience apart from the Hollywood mainstream.  Conclusion:  if you like horror, this is a must - see.  Just don't forget to bring a spare set of clean underwear.",10,2,3,19 March 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," My Eyes Are Feeling Blessed
","I just came back from seeing a 'Kill Bill' double feature, i. e. volume 1 and 2 back to back, at a good cinema with a large screen.  That is the way 'Kill Bill' was supposed to be seen, not one after the other with a few months in between but as one movie, and definitely not on a TV mini screen with commercial breaks.  I am a happy man now;  I purely enjoyed it;  I don't want to talk about it.  Folks who didn't like this monster movie, please hold your peace and lead fruitful lives.  Probably you're right, maybe it's just monstrous garbage, but the message that got across to me is: Quentin Tarantino loves this garbage and he's top at it.  Quentin, thank you for alleviating my cynicism.  Dissenters, thanks for dissenting.",Null,0,1,3 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cinematic Crime Of The Century
","On top of everything that has already been said about 'The Phantom Menace', how it is such a god - awful piece of trash without any redeeming values whatsoever (and that's the simple, non - negotiable truth, Ruth), I would just like to point out that even the special effects are crap! Unbelievable!  The interaction between the real actors and the CG characters is terrible, all the CGI is completely run of the mill, and the composite images (real life and CG) just never fit together, it's like they have been pasted in on a photocopier.I went to see this at the cinema when it came out, and I am still angry about how I have been had.  I am going to boycott Episodes 2 and 3, that is going to be my little revenge on George Lucas for stealing my money, wasting my time, and boring the living hell out of me.",Null,2,4,21 April 2002
Meet the Parents," No Fun To Watch
","I really could have done with a good comedy, but this movie was just painful to sit through.  To give you an idea, a good deal of the gags is built around the lead character´s name, Gaylord Focker (the rest of the jokes deal with a potty - trained cat).  This could have been a classic comedy, with a good cast (including one of my favourite comedy actors, Ben Stiller) great plot idea, big budget, experienced director, etc., but the script was obviously written by a retarded 3 year old undergoing toilet training.  Wait for it on TV, or rent 'Keeping The Faith' instead.",Null,1,2,26 June 2001
Akira," Not Disney, Thank God
","This was the first Japanese animation movie I ever saw -- I was totally unprepared what I was in for, and left the cinema stunned and amazed.  For me, without any doubt, Akira is a seminal film.  The story, animation, everything is perfect.  The soundtrack is something else, absolutely the best I know and a piece of art in its own right -- the voices of the dolls Akira sees in his nightmare, for example, are pygmies, not children or a studio effect.  I bought the OST as a super expensive import CD for one of my girl friends, and the daft cow completely failed to appreciate it ... oh well, her loss.This movie makes Disney look very, very old.  Absolutely a must - see -- 11 / 10.",10,4,7,1 March 2001
Inglourious Basterds," Life's a Tarantino movie, and then you die
","Great movie, but let's face it: it's a bitch to review. Which might be the reason why so many professional critics weren't so glowing about it.I went into this expecting a spoof of 1979 Italoxploitation schlocker 'Inglorious Bastards', a boyish fantasy of a band of gallow birds mcguyvering against the Third Reich. There is that aspect to the movie, and maybe this was Tarantino's original intention, but it's just one aspect of it. In fact, I'd say it's by far the feeblest subplot of the entire film: Brad Pitt leads an ultracruel bunch of renegades who massacre any German (viz Nazi) they can lay their hand on. I thought that Pitt was miscast and underdeveloped, and he reminded me too much of his role in Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels.By the way, professional critics empathized that the 'Basterds' are Jewish and that the movie, therefore, was inverting the movie stereotype of portraying the Jews as sympathetic but ultimately lethargic victims. However, this isn't really the story that the movie, at least in its final cut, tells us: granted, all the Basterds are somewhat swarthy and one of them is called the 'Judenbär' (Jewish bear), but their leader is a former Southern bootlegger and supposedly a gentile. Overall, and other than in the original 'Bastards' movie, the background, personalities and motivations of the Basterds is mostly left in the dark. So many professional critics seem not to have watched the final release of the movie very attentively.By far the greatest antihero of this movie is SS colonel Hans Landa, brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Waltz. He's like James Bond out to catch and kill Jews. Easily one of the evilest characters ever created by cinema, he's the Ernest Stavro Blofeld of the new millennium (or the Second World War, if you will).The movie is an amoral, surprisingly sober roller coaster ride. I won't go into details -- it's a Pedro Almodovar-like brew of great storytelling and eccentricities mixed with Star Wars-like megalomania. But trust me, if you like Tarantino's other movies, the Basterds won't let you down.",9,2,8,26 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," When I was fourteen years old
","I saw the first Star Wars movie when I was around 14 years old at a friend's birthday party, his father owned the first VCR far and wide. The tape was probably rented from a video store. Thirty years later, it seems that they have nailed the concept. There's a lot of soap opera, a surprising amount of Holocaust movie tropes (families being torn apart and genocide by crazy dictator), and there is a strange fixation on daddy (he will make it right, but he's the incarnation of evil, but they made him to do it).Rogue One is the umpteenth part of the franchise, and in no way a 'stand alone' as Disney would have us believe (maybe in order to prepare us for the fact that they'll be churning out more 'episodes' annually.Hold on, I've just googled it, actually the studio has ANNOUNCED that the next episodes will appear annually.In brief, I liked the spectacular effects in the last third of the movie. Storywise, it's a wild rehash of tropes from all genres. The combat scenes are pretty much 'Platoon' with lasers (the rebels even wear GI-style helmets all of a sudden), the intrusion to the VCR storage tower are lifted directly from '2001'.I actually wouldn't have seen Rogue One at the cinema, but the town I was in has one of the biggest screens in the country, and Rogue One was what was on. I've just had my fill with Star Wars. You kids enjoy.",4,6,12,31 December 2016
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Painful
","I haven't read the book so I'm not anal about the movie digressing from the original plot. But it's still a horrible movie. If you want to make a schlocky love movie with Nicholas Cage affecting a risible Italian accent like out of some Little Cesar's Pizza commercial, be my guest. But please show some respect and don't base it on a real tragedy, the bloody German-Italian occupation of Greece in the Second World War and the 1943 massacre of 9000 Italian troops by the Germans.To be fair to the movie, Penelope Cruz does her usual excellent job of playing an attractive girl who painfully holds out against her romantic feelings before eventually giving in to love. The only problem is that I've seen her in this role before. Other than that, the movie is 1950ies-type of inane. The Greeks are proud archetypes (but hey, daddy's still all for emancipation and that), the Italians are jolly opera boffins, and the Germans uptight, evil maniacs. Beautiful, proud Pelagia is betrothed to a resistance fighter but has the hots for a jaunty Italian soldier. You connect the dots. That's really all there is to it.The sad thing is that the entire plot's long been done before, a million times better, and with infinitely more charme, in the 1991 Italian movie Mediterraneo. If you like the general idea of a romantic comedy about Italians occupying a Greek island, and going native in the process, you've struck gold. Captain Corelli's Mondolin, on the other hand, is trite sh*te.",3,5,9,19 August 2009
Zootopia," Great entertainment with a bizarre agenda
","I wasn't actually too keen on another furry Disney / Pixar movie, but I was swayed. Zootopia is amazingly good and entertaining on so many other levels but cuteness. If nothing else, the whole mobster subplot with 'Mr. Big', a godfather in the shape of a shrew (that's a small mouse), won me over. It's amazing how such a large production that requires cooperation on so many levels can still be creative, fun and original. The movie is on a qualitative level with the best of Pixar productions (possibly because Pixar man John Lasseter acted as creative supervisor).What I didn't enjoy at all, however, was having the the usual Disney schmaltz about a young girl making it in the Big Apple against all odds whilst fighting for a multicultural society where all animals, and even rabbits and foxes, live together in peace and harmony to the sound of Shakira, into my face.",8,4,6,15 August 2016
Argo," This just in: Seventies taches win Best Picture
","Argo showcases the little-known Canadian Caper during the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-81. Six US embassy workers had managed to escape capture and were secretly hosted by the Canadian ambassador and another Canadian embassy worker. After about three months, all US citizens managed to escape with fake passports on an ordinary scheduled flight. Nice story, happy ending. What adds some zazz to the story is that an elaborate cover story was created, in which the group of Americans had been scouting in Iran for a film location for a cheesy sci-fi flick. To corroborate this, a film script was created (or actually, re-used), a production company was set up, ads were put in Vanity Fair.Fantastic story, but one that doesn't actually translate well into a movie. The storming of the embassy creates the movie's only visually dramatic scene. The agony of spending three months in a fairly cushy prison doesn't come across well on the big screen. The same goes for the setting up of the Hollywood back story. The film then tries to create a second dramatic highlight when the group has to go through passport control before boarding the plane, and it does so with lots of old-fashioned Hollywood cheese. In the end, the plane is chased across the runway by cars full of gun-wielding soldiers but manages to take off. Whew!Argo isn't terribly bad or anything, it's just unremarkable.",4,4,7,4 March 2013
Public Enemies," Public Enemy, but not Chuck Dee Public Enemy Public Enemy
","Decent Michael Mann movie. Kept me riveted to the chair as I was watching it, and I don't demand much more of a movie.A few points of gratuitous criticism, though:*The movie takes a few too many liberties with history; I realise this is not a History Channel documentary, but it should at least loosely adhere to the real order of things; to point out one rub, we see Pretty Boy Floyd getting shot at the beginning of the movie, although he was actually killed after Dillinger.*Most of the movie is shot in digital video, on a Sony HD video camera; I was disappointed. The images were grainy and too contrasty, and even skewed -- circles looked like ellipses. The few scenes shot on regular film were a visual relief. Basically the cinematography was crap.*In one scene a fed beats a girl and is wrestled down to the ground by his boss. I found that scene unbelievable and gratuitous -- after all, innocent bystanders are getting killed, and a hard-as-nails cop takes umbrage against a gangster moll being roughed up?*Unlike shown in the movie, Dillinger was dating other women than Billie Frechette; e. g. the girl he went to the Biograph with was his actual-life girlfriend.*Unfortunately, the movie makes no mention of the Great Depression and the economic circumstances it was set in. In the current economic crisis, many people would have liked to see more of the situation in a previous one.*A few scenes didn't gel. For example, I could have sworn that Dillinger got shot dead in the Little Bohemia shootout scene, and in the next scene he's jumping around. Maybe I'm just slow.What I really did enjoy were the cinema gags. For example, Dillinger sits in the cinema when the lights go on and the voice from the silver screen tells viewers to look left and right if their seatmate is John Dillinger.I also liked the detail of Dillinger going with the times and sporting a (badly cut) Clark Gable-moustache at the end of the movie.",7,1,3,18 August 2009
Madagascar," We killed them and ate their livers ...
","I'd heard some lacklustre reviews and seen the equally so-so ratings here on IMDb (currently only 6.6 out of 10), so I started watching Madagascar with a sense of guilt about my cinematic masochism -- 'I'll probably complain afterwards that this movie was a complete waste of my time, and spend another half hour writing a scathing review on IMDb'. To my delight I found out that I was not driven by masochism but by my keen instinct for good movies, which had lead me directly to the perfect feature-length cartoon! The humour is fresh and surprisingly edgy (though not vulgar), less along the lines of Disney and leaning more towards Tex Avery and Chuck Jones. The animations are amazing. The voicework is also ... amazing (sorry if I'm repeating myself here).Kids are going to enjoy this one because it's a brightly coloured buddy movie with cuddly animals, but their accompanying adults will love it. The film is brimming with cultural references and doesn't mind taking a little risk for a good joke. For example, there is a couple of suave monkeys, whose intellectual musings invariably lead to the conclusion that they are going to fling poo at people.Like I said, the voicework is amazing. Chris Rock as Marty the zebra is so good, you kind of start seeing Marty before your mental eye even without the animation. Jada Pinkett Smith as Gloria the hippo is a gem. It's ironic that the actress herself is thin as a stick but succeeds in sounding like the 'ought to watch her weight a little' Gloria. Gloria is at the same time sexy and motherly and in charge -- she's a whole lotta woman. Why don't I ever get to date hippopotami like that?OK, towards the end, for about ten minutes, the movie gets a bit sickly-sweet and heavy on morality. Alex the lion discovers that he is really a lion and that life consists of eating other animal which are also cute and furry. He solves this by discovering ... sushi. So maybe you should refrain from informing your children that sushi consists of fish such as Nemo, eaten raw on a bed of soured rice.Bottom line: if you like cartoons, Madagascar is a must-see. And if you don't like cartoons then stay the hell away from me, you sorry freak.",9,0,0,31 January 2009
Pirate Radio," The Boat That Sucked
","I don't give the lowest ranking lightly. Especially not to a movie so jam-packed with talented actors, a decent director and the world's greatest setting: a pirate boat that broadcasts rock music in the Sixties. Who wouldn't like to dream oneself away to that place and time? What groundwork for great comedy! But director Richard Curtis opts to go for a bit of listless tomfoolery with famous actors instead. Let me correct myself: director Richard Curtis opts to go for OVER TWO HOURS of listless faffing about. With famous actors.The story: in 1966, a pubescent boy is sent by his mother to stay with his godfather onboard 'Radio Rock', a radio station on a ship obviously modeled on legendary Radio Caroline. Yes, the script is THAT hammy. Various antics ensue. The all-male DJs play various pranks on each other. Every two weeks they are visited by groupies, and, oh yeah, this is the Sixties, so everybody is real loosey-goosey, takes drugs and shags groupies. Richard Curtis must have mistaken the Austin Powers movies for documentaries.",1,3,9,25 January 2011
Hot Fuzz," Fuzzy Stuff
","This one is pretty easy to review: a solid comedy. Worth catching on DVD or TV, but not quite something I'd need to see on the big screen. If you've never seen anything by Wright or Pegg you're in for a treat. If you've seen Shaun Of The Dead then basically it's the same ticket, albeit somewhat less successfully so.One major snag of this movie is that it's difficult to empathize with the lead character Angel -- he's a bit of a stiff. Whereas Shaun was instantly congenial.In the DVD commentary Simon Pegg repeatedly mentions that he didn't want to 'overegg the pudding' -- I think that he ended up underegging it. There are many good jokes in Hot Fuzz, but I would have preferred a barrage -- the rapid stream that Shaun threw at you.",Null,0,0,25 April 2008
Spotlight," Lecture me
","It's not that this isn't a star-studded gripping movie about an important subject. It just wasn't best picture to me (for which it won an Academy Award, along with best screenplay). For that it played it far too safely. Much of the movie reminded me of the 1994 'The Paper', also headlined by Michael Keaton.In a way, The Paper was better because it was entirely fictional and therefore could go all-out. 'Spotlight' (named after the editorial crew of the Boston Globe that uncovered the scandal) kinda had to try to fit the facts. For example, the journalists seemed to do relatively little uncovering themselves, for that they relied heavily on attorneys, experts and interest groups, and at times they even blocked the investigation. Boston is described as a type of mafia territory where you can't escape the Catholic church, except for when you're Jewish or Armenian. That seemed a pretty shallow explanation.Rachel McAdams didn't seemed too much of a Hollywood blonde to fit into the newspaper. Have you ever seen newspaper journalists? There's a reason they don't work in front of the camera.For me, I'd rather have a great movie about a trifling subject than a good movie about an important subject. Because I don't like being schooled by mother.",7,5,8,26 March 2016
Youth," A lesson with Sir Michael Caine
","This is not a good film, but a first-rate lesson about the nature of film making.When you start out, you have no equipment, no funds, no stars, no technology, no clue, but hopefully a good story.Many years later, when you've come up in the world, you're shooting a scene with Sir Michael Caine in a plush mountain resort which you and your crew are occupying for months on end. You have set expert designers, cameramen, sound people, beautiful extras, the works.You might feel like you're on top of your game. But when you don't have a great script, with a good story and dialogue, all the great set designers in the world, and not even Sir Michael Caine, won't be able to stop the movie from going down the drain.Because making a movie is not much more than telling a two-minute fireside story with a lot of ballast.I watched this movie because of the witty photo with SMC (Sir Michael Caine) and Harvey Keitel ogling a babe at a swimming pool. Unfortunately, that turned out to be the only appealing aspect of this movie.",2,5,6,10 September 2016
Blades of Glory," Blazing Blades!
","Strangely, professional ice skating is yet unmarked comedic territory -- or at least I can't think of another comedy that deals with it -- which Blades Of Glory boldly enters. Hollywood's top gauche actors, Will Ferrell (that burly one with the overly closely set eyes) and Napoleon Dynamite's Jon Heder (should consider closing his mouth once in a while and losing that perm) team up to reach for gold. For about one hour it's pretty solid, if predictable, comedy: Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder) are top figure skating champions who lose their license for duking it out on the podium. After a while in the doldrums, they discover a legal loophole and storm back onto the ice as the world's first all-male pair skating team, only to face the world's most pernicious Teutonic siblings on skates ...Amazingly, both Ferrell and Heder learned to skate well enough to blend in seamlessly with the SFX, which makes the figures look surprisingly authentic (no mean feat, and of the directors remarked quite believably that this movie was like a Waterworld on ice). It's mostly cheap but effective jibes against the colourful world of ice skating, where primadonnas perform amazing feats in glittery spandex (and that's just the men) -- and the references to Tonya Harding, Brian Boitano and Elvis Stojko come thick and fast. The movie is at its best when it just lets Will Ferrell rip -- such as in the Sex Addicts Anonymous scene. Will Ferrell might not be the comedian to impress your in-laws with, but he is like the Boris Spassky of silly fun. The movie runs out of steam and gags towards the end and can't escape predictability, but, hey, it's still good entertainment on a slow evening.",6,1,1,1 February 2009
Malcolm X," Malcolm Big
","There's two ways to look at this movie: as an entertaining evening filler, a roller-coaster of a movie, it's very successful -- strange, and no mean feat, for a biopic about a radical black leader from yesteryear. As a biography however, which is supposed to tell you the truth about a person, I think it's simply a piece of blatant propaganda. I see it as a lost chance to do the man Malcolm X Little justice, and also to show up the critical aspects of his persona.The acting is great, I particularly enjoyed Angela Bassett as Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz, as well as director Spike Lee playing Malcolm's zoot era friend, the wily Shorty. Overall this movie is well made, as can be expected of a great director such as Spike Lee.OK, let's focus on content, then. Malcolm X wasn't Martin Luther King, but this movie portrays him like he had been King's ghetto version. In his autobiography, Malcolm X describes himself as having started as a street thug, although one who was driven to this life by racism, who was transformed in prison to a black minister and leader. An alternative but possibly more enlightened way to describe his career would be that he took up the same profession as his father, that of a black separatist minister (his father had followed Marcus Garvey, Malcolm followed Elijah Muhammad instead).Another fact that the movie didn't bring out is that the Nation Of Islam are no Muslims. They were an idiosyncratic black American sect which borrowed some formal aspects from Islam, and sold Elijah Muhammad instead of adhering to his prophet namesake. One interesting question to ask yourself about Malcolm X is, when did he figure out that the NOI were about as halal as ham hock? If he really only became wise to the game after Muhammad had kicked him out, that would have made him seem a bit dim in the intellectual department (and I don't think that he was anything but sharp). But if he found out before then why didn't he leave the sect by himself? Does anyone really buy his magic transformation into a proper Muslim and non-racist on the hadj he went on after he had been forced to leave NOI? In the movie, Malcolm starts to doubt Elijah Muhammad pretty abruptly when he finds out that he has fathered children with his -- very much younger -- secretaries. This is shown melodramatically where the mothers are dressed up in their full freaky NOI costume, have their darling children playing around their feet and profess that they are only worried about their toddlers' wellbeing, i. e. present the picture of purity. I didn't buy that either, neither in the film nor in Malcolm X's life.There are simply some aspects this movie should have addressed, some questions it should have raised. Instead it 'cultivates' and adulates Malcom X. Apart from being a fierce speaker and writer, what actual plans did Malcolm X have? Did he implement them, did they work out, did they fail? How serious was he about separating the races, or was that just rhetorics? Did he actually further or hinder the Civil Rights movement? Didn't he, especially in the light of Obama, fail quite badly by his own standards? One scene I didn't buy at all was when Malcolm liberates a black man from racist police imprisonment. He threatens the officer in charge by telling him to look out of the window, through which we see a thin row of NOI goons standing before the police precinct. Somehow the captain freaks at the sight of 20 dudes in suits and ties and immediately gives in. In the following scene, Malcolm gives them a sign and they turn around like robots and march off. Wow, that's how the NOI fought? Too bad Martin Luther King hadn't thought of that. Although I'd advise anyone not to don suit and tie and descend on the local police outpost yet. Spike Lee feeds us off with simple cinematic razzle-dazzle.Spike Lee also tells us quite unambiguously that Malcolm's father was murdered by the KKK, where this is at best highly speculative.Another point: were the NOI with their guru, their uniforms, their sex separation and their bodyguards not perhaps a pretty scary outfit? Scary not only in 'the KKK had finally met their match'-sense but more as in 'made the KKK seem like a regular bunch of guys with a hood fixation, and the John Birch Society like a bunch of hippies'? Just a thought.Then in the final scene Spike Lee serves up a 'I'm Malcom X' scene which wouldn't have looked out of place in a Stalinist propaganda film.Malcolm X once said that all his achievements should be blamed on Allah, and only his failings on himself. Spike Lee should have taken his word. If you want to learn more about Malcolm X, then even his autobiography is a better choice.",4,32,66,21 December 2008
The Devil Wears Prada," Two movies for the price of one
","There are two movies here: one is a terribly vapid, insipid, shallow, hokey, schlocky (you get the impression) small-town-girl-in-the-big-city flick that will appeal mostly to small-town girls and their sympathizers. I couldn't make up my mind which was the schlockiest bit, when Anne Hathaway, the girl who holds the Guiness world record for biggest lips and eyes and who makes anorexic nymphs look ungainly, has to play the fat, unstylish, ugly duckling, or when she has fake moral qualms about telling her colleague that she will supplant her on a dream trip to Paris. I was writhing on the floor in agony and shaking my fist towards the sky at so much cinematic glucose. And, of course, in the end our ingénue gains everyone's respect including that of her demon boss, and does the right thing by writing stirring stuff about servants on strike for a newspaper where everything and everybody has a greyish hue of brown (viz, the real world). And her boyfriend's a cook (Jamie Oliver's influence becomes palpable here) who makes her grilled cheese sandwiches with 'five dollars' worth of Jarlsberg' in them. Retch!Luckily there is also the other movie, one that features The Streepster as the fashion editor which makes the devil on his throne with his troop of succubi and incubi dancing around him look meek; Stanley Tucci as the extravagant fashion expert; and most of all Emily Blunt as our lead's super-sarcastic colleague (the one who doesn't get to go to Paris). Emily Blunt is a real discovery and pretty much makes this movie. I'm surprised that she hasn't been in every movie that was ever made since then. On that level the movie is really well-made and fun. All you have to do is to tune out of the scenes that don't feature the aforementioned three actors, and you'll be sound as a pound.",7,2,4,6 April 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Personal Rant
","Reasons why I will boycott 'Star Wars Episode II -- Attack Of The Clones':*  The 'original' Star Wars was exciting because of the ground - breaking special effects and because of the saga character.  A generation on, the Star Wars 'Episodes' have nothing new to offer, especially in the field of special effects.*  'Episode I -- The Phantom Menace' sucked badly, especially considering that it was one of the most hyped and highest - grossing movies of all time.*  It really, really, really, really sucked.*  And I will only be suckered once.*  There is no such thing as a 'must see'.  Especially not in the field of Star Wars.  I want to see Star Wars to be entertained, and not to join the Millions who can claim that they have seen the entire series.*  George Lucas is a rich enough man already.*  George Lucas should limit himself to producing and the technical aspects, and leave the creative bits (writing and directing) to someone with talent.*  Even the special effects in E1 were awful -- to speak nothing of the story, dialogue, acting -- in fact everything that makes a movie.*  Jar Jar Binks in Episode I is the single most annoying, unfunny nd offensive character in movie history ... and Lucas thought it necessary to roll him out again for the sequel, because, as he told German magazine Spiegel, he is not one to be swayed by public opinion or prescreenings. Sure signs of megalomania are beginning to show ... where are the guys in white suits and rubber sneakers when you need them?*  So what if E2 is 'not as bad as' or even 'better than' E1 -- the 'Mentos - The Fresh Maker' commercials are cinematic genius compared to E1.*  There is romance in E2.  I just don't trust George Lucas with romance, the same way I wouldn't trust Jane Campion with sci-fi or action.  And the reviews I have read so far vindicate me.*  The original Star Wars was likeable because it was aimed at nerds.  The 'Episodes' are strictly Disney, clean, wholesome, family fun, and utterly boring.  Even worse, often they are just a boring, long advert for the tie - in video games and similar merchandise.*  It will come out on video rental or TV soon enough anyway ... I am not that desperate to be parted from my money.That's it, I'm done ranting.  Thank you for your attention.",Null,2,5,17 May 2002

Burn After Reading," Laugh While Watching
","Burn After Reading is an infectious comedy from those pesky Coen brothers. Too bad that many reviewers here couldn't appreciate it. Like all Coen movies, it's strange and often unlike anything else you've seen before. It's fairly characteristic of them rather than a departure from their previous style, so if you've enjoyed their old movies then you should check this one out.I think it's the kind of movie that grows on you, and which you're going to like even better over the years; the movie has many subtleties in it which you can only spot and appreciate over repeated viewings. But don't worry, you'll get most of it the first time.Essentially, the movie shows fairly average beltway denizens behaving stupidly, with a good amount of bureaucracy and bad luck stirred in for good measure. It's not so much intellectual satire as much as smart slapstick. I'm not going to go into the cast, but it's both A-list and excellent. Even the bit parts are memorable, and will hopefully provide rich pickings for other directors. And it's got David Rasche (Sledge Hammer) in it, and he's awesome yet again!Kind of hard to rate this one, but for sheer entertainment value it'd be a straight ten.Just a few Q&A's you might want to know about this movie:*Is it a poignant satire of the CiA? A damning indictment of the American secret service and military community in general? Or of the Bush administration? -- Not really. It's not political, it's simply a comedy.*Many people seem not to have liked this, why? -- Beats me. Maybe they were expecting poignant political satire, when really the movie is just comedy. And the story is fairly complex so that you're left a bit puzzled when the titles roll.*What's that wedge pillow which Clooney's character takes with him when he's leaving his lover? -- It's a sex wedge, a pillow designed to facilitate the bumping of uglies. Apparently.",8,2,6,9 November 2008

High school kid aspires to be Evil-Knievel-type stunt man and starts out by attempting to jump across the city swimming pool on his moped, before eventually taking on the inevitable row of school buses. Could have been a good comedy, and the actors would have had it in them, too. Unfortunately, good actors, the Eighties (or was it the late Seventies?) and a funny premise alone don't make it a comedy. The main problem here is predictability. You can watch the first and final ten minutes of the movie and draw the lines. And the dialogue is equally predictable.",3,4,12,28 January 2013
Armageddon," Cinematic Armageddon
","I will say this for Armageddon:  it is the only movie I have ever watched at an outdoors (car) cinema, and it was perfect for that, with all its overblown tackiness.  In all other imaginable settings though, be it regular cinema or TV screen, I would rather give it a miss.  Man, is it awful!",Null,0,1,16 April 2001
U-571," Shipwreck
","I rented U-571 thinking that a movie with submarines and Harvey Keitel in it would at least be vaguely entertaining, but boy, was I wrong. As for its mindless entertainment value, if you have only ever seen one u - boat movie you will essentially have seen U-571 because it goes to great pains not to miss any cliché in the book; the first third in particular is an almost exact copy of 'Das Boot'.What really angers me about U-571 though, apart from it being a really bad movie, is the premeditated way it tries to remanufacture history. Without going into details: the actual Enigma machine was relatively well known, the difficult bit was cracking the code -- which was brilliantly accomplished by the British (after some spadework from the Poles). Next there is the cheap attempt to whitewash racial segregation in the US by throwing in a black sailor and then putting the onus on the Germans by showing a German sailor being shocked at seeing a black person -- maybe it was the historical inaccuracy he was astounded by. Even worse, the film promotes an almost fascist type of ideology, namely the leader principle, mindless submission to authority, the objective must be achieved regardless of the cost of human life (enemy or comrade). So ironically, U-571, with reversed sides and minus the special effects, could pass for a German propaganda movie of that era.",1,47,70,20 October 2007
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Flawless fun in Africa
","What can I say, I'm stunned. It's that good.The creators of Madagascar use computer animation to boldly take slapstick to the next level. How 'bout duking it out with a nice old lady? Hey, let's run her over with a car! Something you'd expect to happen maybe in an ultra-gory mafia movie, but here it's fun for the entire family. But she rebounds Terminator-style, so don't worry, ma, it's only pixels.You could watch this movie scene-by-scene and it'd still be great fun. Those penguins are amazing. Rico ... manual!!! I like Skipper best of all (with Private, Kowalski and Rico a close second), and he's voiced by Tom McGrath, who's actually moonlighting as a sync actor but the movie's director in the real life. No mean feat. There's a cute lost son story for the kids, and lots of slick, crass urban fun for the adults.This is the Blues Brothers for the 21. century. I'll bet this'll go classic!",9,1,1,16 August 2009
Jarhead," Half Metal Jacket
","Jarhead is an innovative war movie which held my attention well and does have its moments. It's actually a lot like Full Metal Jacket, without being exploitative of the former, and unfortunately, also without being quite as good.The movie follows the autobiographical account of a marine sniper (Surveillance / Target Acquisition = STA) in the first Gulf War. This was a fairly boring war, in that the US military fully exploited their technological advantage to bomb Iraqi forces into submission, which didn't leave a lot for the ground units to do. Kind of like the current Iraq war in reverse. The bottom line is that the author, although highly trained and motivated, saw practically no action.The movie is (as far as I can judge) realistic in that it reproduces the soldier's perspective pretty well: you're never really on top of things information-wise, and doubly scared that you might either buy it or not see any action at all. The latter comes true for the narrator, who doesn't even get to fire his rifle once. Overall, he probably left the arena feeling that despite all his efforts, he contributed absolutely nothing to a war that was fought out by 'zoomies' (planes and rockets).The movie doesn't have a lot of action, and consequently struggles a bit to fill its length. I didn't like the scenes which seemed to have been taken out of some gay softporn flick, with lots of cute but moody underwear models lounging around in army outfits and being a bit too physical with each other. The burning oilwells-scene was visually overdone. But there are many great scenes, too, such as when the STA team beg for being allowed to kill at least one Iraqi before an airstrike because 'It's not fair, he's going to die anyway!'. Or in the way the movie displays the interactions between the comrades. Or when the returning unit are being greeted by an enthusiastic but clearly encumbered Vietnam veteran, who gives them a scary view of what's in store for them once the parade is over.",7,1,1,16 August 2008
Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher, good comedy
","I saw this in a special presentation in a cinema full of teachers. And judging from their guffaws they seemed to enjoy the movie.Liz is a brassy blonde who, at the end of her thirties, is on the verge of fulfilling her lifetime ambition: marrying a rich simpleton. But then his mum calls of the wedding, and Liz has to return to her reviled breadjob as a middle school teacher. To her never-ending amazement, all her other colleagues -- the middle-aged loner, the hippie, the preppy goody-two-shoed apple-cheeked nightmare -- seem to actually enjoy teaching spotty dropouts. The script does an excellent job of lining up every comedic angle of the dreary hell that is school life and linking it together with a fast-paced storyline. Cameron Diaz is excellent because she isn't afraid to actually look old, spent and wrinkled (but never unfoxy), and Phyllis Smith and Lucy Punch also stand out among the excellent cast. Justin Timberlake -- eye candy for the ladies, in case you wondered. The soppy, romantic, test-audience-compatible ending -- best ignored.This is an enjoyable light-but-dark comedy that everybody who has had anything to do with school life can dig. And I hope that most people here have encountered a school at some part of their lives.",8,36,71,26 June 2011
Tigerland," Popcorn Movie Director Has A Go At Realism
","I think I'm going off 'Vietnam'-movies for good. They just seem to have become (or -- probably -- always have been) a vehicle for hunky young actors to allow them to pose in macho garb (t-shirts, camo fatigues and dog-tags -- you know the score) and to toy around with guns and explosives. Tigerland at least uses a fairly innovative setting (a training camp in the US rather than the actual war theatre -- which had the nice side effect of making it a fairly inexpensive movie to make, and which spared me the usual 'Argh! Oh no, Johnny! You bastards!!! Takatakataka'-battle scenes), but any attempts to deliver new insights are stunted by director Joel Schumacher who instead prefers to go for a visual celebration of hunkiness coupled with wobbly hand-camera / digital video visuals.One particular scene that stuck to my mind, if only for it's unabashed campness, is when the film's lead buddies hang out together after they have just had sex with two nightclub floozies (like in all Vietnam movies, when the soldiers are not being yelled at by sadistic drill sergeants or engaging in battle scenes with more fireworks than July 4.th, they're instantly having sex with whorish women). They seem to be so into each other, and so completely disinterested in the girls, that I wouldn't have been surprised if one of them had broken out the baby oil ('Here, let me soothe you -- do you work out?' 'Oh, it feels so good...'), thereby earning this scene a cult following in the gay community.The only thing that can be said for Colin Farrell is that he disguises his Irish brogue effectively and that he has poster-boy looks. If you fancy him then this movie probably is a must-see for you. You even get a glance of his naked butt.",Null,0,0,17 July 2004
Bridesmaids," Rom-Com alert!
","My problem with this movie is that in my parts it was touted as a breakthrough female comedy, where women lead a raucous comedic existence of their own. Which is pretty far off the mark for a good but conventional rom-com (half romance, half comedy) that was designed to evoke chuckles, and the occasional tender sob, without offending anyone. Probably one positive aspect of the movie's hybrid nature is that it's never at risk of becoming the female version of 'The Hangover', on the other hand the romance between wayward Anne and that Irish State Trooper is very bland and sickly. There is lots of comedic talent on board, but it's used very ineffectively. Indeed, the hilarious movie trailer consists mostly of scenes that never made it into the final cut -- why they wasted great scenes must remain the producers' filthy little secret.",Null,0,0,7 August 2011
Man on the Moon," Flop
","I didn't know Andy Kaufman before Milos Forman's movie, and after watching it I have no interest in learning more about him.  Jim Carey no doubt gives an outstanding performance, but his character still comes across as annoying rather than funny or even captivating.  Forman used to explore unconventional personalities in his movies, such as 'One Flew Over A Cuckoo's Nest' and 'Amadeus', but at least since 'The People Vs. Larry Flint' he stopped exploring and started displaying.  I found myself fast - forwarding through this one, thank god I didn't have to sit it through in a cinema.",Null,1,2,12 June 2001
Good Will Hunting," I Feel Dirty And It Won't Wash Off
","I first saw this movie when it came out in the cinema and enjoyed it. Then I saw it again today on TV and was dismayed at much I had apparently been sucked in by the Hollywood hype:  two kids write the screenplay, star in it as well, it's an utterly brilliant film and gets an Oscar -- and I fell for it hook, line and sinker.  OK, I will let this be a lesson to myself.  The way I see it today is that it is a well - executed film, but the story is pure drizzle.  Not just non - academic yob turns out to be talented, that would have been a realistic premise and could have made for a likeable movie.  But not good enough for Hollywood -- instead it has to be a janitor at the MIT, and of course he is a gazillion times more brilliant than the professor (who is of course a field - medal - aspiring genius in his own right) of the very building he is working in.  Hold on, I'm not finished. And this dude is also a genius in other areas, at least enough so to impress the judge with his legal cognizance, and he can quote lengthy passages out of philosophy books and he's into organic chemistry just for kicks, and he is a total fire - fighter - cute hunk as well, and he's good at fisticuffs too, and he wins the heart and hand of this super - intelligent, cute and rich chick who turns out to have a heart of gold and is the only one to accept him for what he really is, but he has got this problem facing his own genius because he would rather continue his squalid life of petty crime and dead - end jobs (hey, don't we all?), but then this brilliant psychiatrist who looks ten times more like Sigmund Freud than the man himself comes to the rescue, and -- totally unexpected -- things tie up to a happy end. HOW ON EARTH COULD I EVER HAVE FALLEN FOR THIS CRAP?  Did Hollywood temporarily lobotomize me?  Please, someone, shoot me!OK, the bottom line:  highly forgettable film.  End of bottom line.",Null,4,6,30 March 2002
I Am Legend," Zombies, again
","I know that this movie is based on a 'legendary' book, and I presume that it received a lot of hype when it came out stateside. From the fact that it's already out on DVD, I guess it didn't do too well at the box-office.I caught it on DVD and without expecting too much, which allowed the movie to surprise me positively. It is very entertaining while you're still trying to figure out what the duck is going on. Will Smith's acting is outstanding, and the movie builds up the suspense very effectively. It's an intelligent and at the same time entertaining movie which brings a fresh breath of death to the often rather stolid horror genre.That said, it's not perfect either. For instance, the CGI-zombies don't work that well (they look fake, like out of a computer game), and there are many other elements of the movie which overstretch the viewer's credulity for the cheap benefit of a quick thrill (strangely in those movies, the viewer usually buys the general premise -- aliens from Nebulon-3 have invaded earth and are now feeding on puppy's brains -- but gets stuck on fairly minor details such as 'Sgt Brubaker fires 13 rounds of transmuto-semtex at the slime-bot when the clip of the T7/A1 holds only 12'). Right at the beginning, for example, Will Smith hunts deer in a ghost-towned New York City by pursuing them in his shiny Ford Mustang -- cool, spectacular, but also pretty moronic, especially as it later turns out that while he never manages to shoot a single animal for food, he has absolutely no difficulty capturing those blood-guzzling zombies alive. Less would often have been more in this movie, the zombies would have been more effective if they had been less visible, the basement lab would have been more believable if it had been a bit less vulcano-lair-ish and his flat more plausible if it had looked less like straight out of the Ikea catalogue, etc. The movie is best in its quiet moments, like when we realise how the relationship between Neville and his dog represents his last bond to his previous life, or how he uses his daily routine of 'renting' DVDs from a store to keep sane (with varying success).The movie kind of jumps the shark when Anna and that little boy arrive, but luckily it wraps up the story fairly neatly and quickly from there on.And I really can't get over the fact that Anna's never heard of Bob Marley. She's never seen his face, heard his name, and doesn't recognise even his biggest hits. Even my grandma can sing the chorus to 'No Woman No Cry'. From that point on, I was rooting for the zombies.Overall, not a classic but still a solid, entertaining, thrilling movie, with a fantastic performance by Will Smith, and a new twist on an old theme.",7,0,0,9 November 2008
Gran Torino," Kowalski meets the Hmongs
","This is certainly a likable movie for a plethora of reasons, but unfortunately it isn't all that good. Clint plays a disgruntled elderly WPC (white Polish Catholic) and Korean War veteran who's just lost his wife and who, although he hates to admit it to himself, is at the end of his line. To make things worse, a bunch of 'gooks' (Hmong) are bringing down his neighbourhood -- he even catches one of them trying to steal his prized 1972 Gran Torino. When the perp's family sends the li'l rascal over as Kowalski's dogsbody to make amends, the unlikely duo eventually warm to each other. When Kowalski finds out that his neighbours -- gook or not -- are being bullied by a gang of Hmongs gone bad, he decides to settle the affair the old-timey kind of way ...OK, could've been a showcase for old bone Clint, but the story's just too thin and predictable, the story-telling is far too hammy. For example, when Kowalski decides that his new-found protégé is too meek, he takes him along to a friend to show him how real men talk. The two old fogeys then present a model dialogue along the lines of 'What do you want, you cheap Polack SOAB?' -- 'A haircut, if your hectic schedule allows it, you lazy Irish MF.' &c p. p. Kowalski is also being harried by a puffy-faced Catholic priest, with whom he suddenly makes amends at the end of the movie. And he lets on that he's killed at least 13 Koreans in the war, and that he sees their faces each night. It's just all a bit 'seen it before, and better'.It was an OK movie to watch, but it never really goes anywhere.",5,7,14,18 September 2009
No Man's Land," A live mine of a movie
","This movie was up against 'Amélie' in the 2002 Academy Awards and won. So I have to say this right up front: unduly. 'No Man's Land' is a well-made movie about a very worthy subject. Amélie is a groundbreaking masterpiece.Now that that's off my chest and I can sleep soundly again, to the movie itself. No Man's Land starts off with a small platoon of Bosniak replacements getting lost in no man's land, and being consequently viciously cut down by the Serb foes when the sun rises. Only two of the platoon survive badly wounded. One of them is being discovered a a Serb patrol, taken for dead, and placed on a live mine (in order to assault Bosniaks trying to salvage the body). The other Bosniak manages to take one Serb hostage. So now we have three wounded, inexperienced soldiers in the middle of mine-riddled nowhere. The movie takes on a parabolic, abstract note because the soldiers are all wounded, but are surprisingly active and talkative. The first half of the movie deals with the three inept, wounded soldiers confronting each other, without having the guts to gun each other down.Then UNPROFOR gets wind of this conundrum and comes to the the rescue. This is when the movie takes on a satirical twist, and becomes more bearable than the realistically dire first half. But eventually there are no winners in this movie. The knights in white (the warring factions call them the smurfs due to their white uniforms and blue helmets) withdraw and leave a mess behind. We are stuck in Bosnia, a far sight away from cute Hollywood endings.Overall a painful but memorable movie.",6,1,3,18 October 2010
Dumb and Dumber," I thought the Rockies were a lot less flat? -- Me too. That John Denver is full of sh*t, man!
","I didn't like this one much when it came out, but I've changed my mind. It's a great, funny, very entertaining movie. That said, I'd still hold that it's not anywhere near being the 'best comedy ever', as claimed by some fanboys here on IMDb, or even the best Farrelly Bros. movie. That would be asking too much, it being, after all, their first feature movie, and as a consequence still a bit rough around the edges. Namely the plot is a bit on the thin side in that it consists of little more than our two likable losers traveling halfway across the US of A (a nomial distance of 2,200 miles, which they manage to ratchet up to at least 3,000) to return a suitcase to a girl, because one of them has 'that old-fashioned feeling, where I'd do anything to bone her', and then rampage through the city of Aspen.This is because the culmination of the plot, an elaborate kidnapping story, was more or less dumped unceremoniously from the final cut. A very wise choice, as the movie is now essentially a showcase for the perfect comedic duo, the gentle and laid-back Jeff Daniels and the obnoxious-aggressive Jim Carey, in their hilarious quest to cast aspersions on the definition of humans as a sentient species.Jim Carey went on to rise to greater comedic stardom, but Jeff Daniels is just as brilliant here, and a lot more likable.Just as a side note, I always marveled at Carey's brilliant 'chipped tooth prosthetic', until I read here on IMDb that those are his real pearly whites -- he does actually have a chipped tooth and just took the cap off.",7,1,3,5 August 2008
Jerry Maguire," A Feel - Good Movie That Made Me Feel Bad

However, a drunk SYSB is already beyond him, and giving him the part of a SYSB - turned - caring - new - man, as in this movie, is almost cruel.OK, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s acting is outstanding and genuinely funny (he got an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's 'disapproving older sister' minimises the damage done by Cruise and Zellweger somewhat. But why do so many Hollywood flicks have to be so totally devoid of suspense and plausiblity and so full of sugary fakeness and drawing - by - numbers plot?Don't get me wrong.  I like escapist stories, I fancy Renée Zellweger something rotten, and I enjoy walloping in Hollywood mainstream middle - of - the - roadness, once in a while.  But 'Jerry Maguire' is just shallow, sickly sweet garbage designed for people who think that 'Beverly Hills 90210' is deep, meaningful and true to life.WARNING:  people with diabetes or a nervous stomach should avoid the scenes with Dorothy's child Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki) at all cost.",2,21,45,26 February 2001
Quiz Show," Very Well Made, But I Don't Care Much For The Movie's Message
","'Quiz Show' is a pleasure to watch, a very accomplished and engaging movie which I have seen repeatedly in the cinema and on TV.  What I can´t get over, though, is the movie´s finger - wagging moralism;  I mean, it was only a daft 1950`ies TV quiz show that had been rigged, and not a presidential election.  The NBC president is portrayed as a less reputable character than Jabba The Hut, whereas Charles Van Doren comes out as the poor victim for loosing his $80+ / week lecturing job while grossing over $100,000 in quiz show revenues.  The movie's finale comes across as a fairly ridiculous attempt by Hollywood to smear dirt on a competitor.Just as an aside:  quiz shows aren´t educational and Geritol does not really make you 'feel stronger fast'.

The Dark Knight," Darker than dark. And that's pretty dark.
","A much-hyped movie, but rightly so. So far I've hated that posterboy Heath Ledger with all my little black heart, but I have to hand it to him here: he really can act. Wow. I take back everything I've said about 'A Knight's Tale', Heath, especially about the symbolism of men attacking each other with penis-like contraptions, for I was blind to your genius! Ironic that 'The Dark Knight' turned out to be his penultimate film ... but what a way to go.OK, let's cut to the chase: the movie is very impressive in its first half, and possibly a perfect ten. But when Harvey Dent switches sides, it goes haywire. I couldn't really follow the plot anymore, much stopped making sense and was bull (the scene with the two ships that can blow each other up), and there was just a general air of suckiness. It's not terrible, but it did detract from the movie.Part of the problem with Bat- and Superman movies is that the whole idea of being Bat- or Superman makes a lot more sense in a comic book. In a movie, this boyish fantasy comes across as rather gay, especially that Bruce Wayne character with his butler and his fixation on must-have gadgets. And all his relationships with women are platonic and he keeps a toy-boy named 'Robin'. Could it be any more obvious? That's why they had the good sense to downplay Batman and hand the leading part to the much more modern and intriguing Joker. And they really made the most of that role. This Joker will stay in your mind for a long time. A newspaper columnist wrote that this Joker is a reflection of the type of self-sufficient and excessive aggression used by modern terrorists such as Al Quaida, and I agree.I'm just a bit worried about the message of 'a good leader must lie for the greater good, the public must be fooled', especially in an election year. Maybe the makers were trying to tell us something here?On a side note, I'd never have recognised Gary Oldman, one of my favourite thesps! When the titles rolled, I was like, where was he? Who was he?Anyway, a great movie for kid and intellectual alike. And clearly the best Batman movie ever! To be seen at a good cinema.

However, having been told about how good this movie was until my ears dropped off, having seen it referenced on innumerable occasions, and having watched the Spinal Tap-episode of the Simpsons, I kind of anticipated a comedic legend, one of the funniest movies in the history of movie-making, but the buildup turned out to be too big for the actual movie. Ideally you would have seen this at 15, an age when rock 'n' roll still really mattered, and when it came out in 1984, at a time when tediously pompous rock bands in spandex were still all the rage and hip hop and 'alternative' music were still in the offing.

Plus I am not exactly a fan of the Farelly brothers (in fact I pretty much hated their earlier movies, 'Dumb & Dumber' and 'Kingpin'), nor of Cameron Diaz (even though I have since found her quite impressive in 'Being John Malkovich'), and the 'hair gel scene', which featured heavily in the trailers and even the print adverts, seemed to make this movie one to avoid.So when I saw the movie, completely by accident, I was really pleasantly surprised.  Probably the reason why I enjoyed it so much is that, underneath the barrage of silly jokes, it tells a surprisingly accurate (at least from the male point of view), if over - the - top, romance.  I am ashamed to admit it, but the desperate quest of the male characters to get close to Mary, the dream girl who digs men in braces, seemed almost too close for comfort.Conclusion:  men should watch this for fun.

Now the good times are gone, Ellie is dead and Carl about to be shipped off to a retirement home.

The Wind that Shakes the Barley," The Text That Reviews The Movie
","The Wind That Shakes The Barley is a very ambivalent movie. I could write several pages about its pros and cons, but I'll try to be more concise here.TWTSTB laudably deals with an underdealt historical topic, it tries to address a plethora of subjects and tries to be even-handed. And it absolutely isn't, by the way, anti-British. Maybe it's pro-Irish, but that isn't a crime.From an artistic-technical point of view, the movie is flawed in such a way as to make it somewhat long-winded and boring. Probably the main mistake is that it tries to achieve far too much, that it tries to be too balanced and multi-faceted and thorough. Although this attitude certainly suits its very complex and somewhat ignored subject matter, and would be laudable in a 10-hour TV docu-series, in a two-hour cinema movie it just doesn't fly. Loach should have tried to focus on one or two aspects of the conflict instead.Then Loach completely fails to build up his characters. Instead he shows us an excessively violent crime being committed by the British right at the beginning, probably to let us know right off the bat which side he's on (erm ... we already guessed, Ken), which casts a propagandistic pall over the entire movie.I didn't really enjoy watching this movie, but it made me reread about the Irish interbellum struggle, and so did me some good after all.",6,4,7,16 September 2008
Sicario," Sicario, Sickario, Psychario
","I was really stoked about Sicario and went to see it the night it opened. Why was I excited? Well, the posters looked cool and I knew that celebrated director Dennis Villeneuve was expected to deliver a fresh and intelligent suspense movie with a nice dose of action.That, plus Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are in it, and I think they're cool.What I got was a gritty action movie, but unfortunately it wasn't intelligent or thought-provoking. When I'm watching Expendables 3, I'm ready to sit back, enjoy the ride and hold back on the nit-picking. That's not really an option, though, when you have to pay attention to follow the story, and are promised new insights into a deep-rooted problem.*** Spoilers ahead *** I thought it was clever that we see the plot from the perspective of an ingénue, this time in the form of a 'small-time' FBI agent (Kate Mercer played by Emily Blunt). After her SWAT team storms a horror house run by the Mexican cartels in which two of her fellow officers are killed, she's ready to go after the big guys. Her new CIA-lead team is willing to use 'unconventional' (read: highly questionable) methods. They extract a drug lord from a Mexican prison and torture him for information. Kate is told that she is there to 'watch and learn', but ultimately she finds out that she is only there as a goon to legitimize the CIA operating in the homeland. Her function is not to 'watch and learn' but to shut up, keep out and to sign a paper at the end. For the time being though, the team storms a tunnel used to smuggle drugs across the border in a scene that seems to take a page straight out of Zero Dark Twenty ...*** Spoilers thick on the ground from here on *** Sicario really annoyed me because it brings together so much promise with an incredibly lackluster plot. I feel like I could write an entire book about it. What's the point of the horror house at the beginning? If the cartel is using it to dispose bodies, why would they shrink-wrap the corpses? Why are there gun-toting criminals in a house full of incriminating evidence? Why are the corpses behind dry walls (is the cartel planning on renting out the house)? Why is the trap-door booby-trapped? Why do police have to anticipate that in about six months every further crime scene will be booby-trapped if they don't stop the cartel now? When they are illegally extracting the cartel boss from the Mexican prison, why are they doing it in a highly visible convoy? If they anticipate being ambushed just before the frontier, why don't they keep a lane open? Why didn't they use a helicopter? Why don't they just torture the guy in Mexico? What are the ambushers trying to achieve? What is the role of the crooked cop? Could he be any hammier than carrying a gel bend around that the cartel uses to hold their bankrolls together?

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Thank You Mr. Ritchie, Sir
","To those who can find nothing wrong with 'Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels', here is some serious food for thought:1.  The title isn't that good.  I mean, it's kind of lengthy. 2.  Guy Ritchie is old enough to take decisions for himself, but personally I wouldn't have married Madonna, now that she has stopped singing 'Like A Virgin' in her underwear and has jumped on the 'pop diva' bandwagon and has had one in the oven from that dago dancer.But that's just me.  Other than that, I have to concede that Ritchie has come up with a perfect film, which is all the more admirable since it has only been his second directing effort.  I just wish that he will continue to do films like that for the rest of his hopefully long life, and never venture into new territory.In fact, Guy:  leave that scrawny pop tart and marry me.  OK, so she is loaded and famous and a girly and all that, and I am only an overweight cinema boffin who still has his hair cut by his mum and a dubious personal hygiene regimen, but I'd do ya if necessary, and I can give you more love and admiration than this trollop ever will.",Null,0,2,30 March 2002
The Departed," Sad effigy of a Scorsese movie
","I love all Scorsese movies (except maybe Kundun) and thus was stoked to see 'The Departed'. And then sorely disappointed. The movie feels as if Scorsese had made it after a suffering major stroke, as a mere shadow of himself. All the ingredients are there (including the Stones-laden soundtrack) but they don't gel. The movie seems hammy, over the top, vain and self-indulgent, implausible, and simply boring. Like small-time director meets over-sized budget. We follow the stories of two young cops (Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) in a Boston dominated by the god-like Irish mobster Costello (Jack Nicholson); one cop infiltrates the gang, the other cop is on the mob's payroll and infiltrates the police. My first problem here was simply that the two cops are physically so similar that I had a hard time keeping them apart. Then: the script is always hammy, always implausible, never original or intriguing. For example, I didn't buy the scene where one student at a police academy tells another that his girlfriend won't, erm, fellate him until he passes. Crass, yes, supermasculine atmosphere, check, but how gay is it to tell the guy jogging next to you about your sexual regimen (or lack of it)? Throughout the movie men spout abuse at each other to a point that it seems more like SNL on Tourette than Scorsese. Maybe it's the erroneous vision of an old man about how young bucks interact these days. Even Nicholson as the mobster comes across not so much scary but more like an old queer. In one scene he walks through a restaurant after he has been 'interrogating' young members of his gang ('One of them gave the wrong answer!', and he is covered in coagulated blood like a butcher at the end of a long day at the slaughterhouse. Lay it off Martin, I'm not buying it. And finally the movie is about an hour too long for the thin plot.Another hole: the cop infiltrating the mob is stressed out and goes to see a police psychologist (even though his mission is so super-top-secret that only two men at the PD know about it). This sexy shrink happens to be the girlfriend of the other cop (the one who works for the mob). And although she's just moved in with Matt Damon, for Christ's sake, and although her patient is clearly on the edge and aggressive, she starts an affair with him. Despite this the movie makes her out to be morally impeccable to allow her to be morally incensed about the double-dealings of her boyfriend.By the way, I haven't seen the original and don't care how it compares to it. 'The Departed' could not do justice to the original and still be a good movie -- unfortunately, it isn't a good movie.",Null,1,2,14 August 2011
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Has the world gone mad?
","8.5 / 10 IMDb points? 66.th best IMDb movie? Many reviewers' favourite movie of all times bar none? Has the world gone quite mad? To me it's a highly forgettable movie. I'm not really addressing those lost souls who actually enjoyed this, to quote Bill Hicks, p. o. s. film, but to warn those impressionable souls who still haven't seen it: beware! Beware this p. o. s. film!As for the plot, this movie falls roughly into two halves; in the first we follow a contingent of British soldiers in Japanese captivity in Burma during World War II (the one with the funny mustaches). When the dastardly Saito orders the officers to work alongside their regulars -- a breach of the Geneva Convention -- he is faced off by the impeccable colonel Nicholson. Eventually Saito gives in and the British soldiers build him a magnificent railway bridge.In the second half of the movie we follow an American soldier, Shears, who has managed to escape from Saito's jungle camp. Against his will he is sent back on a secret mission to blow up that very bridge.At the climax, two men are pitched against each other: Nicholson, to whom the bridge is a symbol of his perseverance and supremacy, and the American, who has gone through hell and back to destroy it and do damage to the Japs.My major problem with the movie is that colonel Nicholson is obviously a complete idiot. His nemesis Saito may be an evil sadist, but at least he has a weak and human side as well. He is a pudgy little fellow who's been to art school, but now has to make do as a CO. My heart went out to him, whereas I fail to see how anyone can sympathise with the blimpish Nicholson.It's only after the bridge has been completed that a single officer mildly questions the wisdom of building the most magnificent bridge of all times for the Japanese, who are, after all, not exactly their allies. And I never saw what was so unethical about officers working alongside their troops in the first place.Apart from that, it's a pretty conventional, John-Wayne-style war movie. The enemy is inscrutable and evil, Asian women are almond-eyed, servile foxes, the soldiers are undyingly loyal and war is hell but fun (in a rough, it's-a-man's-world sort of way). The production is excellent but overall it's a very dated movie. I'm surprised how anyone would consider this a classic rather than just an old movie. Its only benefit is that it allowed director David Lean to make Lawrence Of Arabia.",3,6,15,25 November 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Uganda -- the great outdoors
","I was curious to see a movie about the notorious Idi Amin but also had the erroneous notion that this movie would be about him in exile in Scotland, or something.Then I was pleasantly surprised at how this movie managed to draw me in immediately. The story of a Scottish young MD doing a stint as a bush doctor had me from the start. James McAvoy as the protagonist Dr Nicholas Garrigan is great, the story is extremely well told and captivating. It has enough flesh on the bone to make a palatable movie on its own. Then Idi arrives on the scene, played exceptionally well by Forrest Whittaker. A behemoth of a man who could charm the pants off the pope. Young Nicholas gets his chance to live the good life at first as Amin's personal doctor, then as the health secretary.I switched off the DVD player after about one hour and had the impression of an exceptionally good movie, one which believably, authentically captured the situation in a post-colonial African state. As I found out the next day, the movie sadly declines from there on and becomes an African version of Escape From Castle Wolfenstein. Nicholas -- otherwise a sensible feller -- elects to shag one of the dictator's wives, who is consequently, inevitably, brutally murdered and dismembered (this is based on a true-ish account of how one of Amin's wives died in a botched abortion and her lover committed suicide). Then Dr Nick becomes involved in the Entebbe hostage situation, suffers horrible torture when Amin reveals to him that he 'knew all along' that he'd been shagging his missus but had apparently waited for an international diplomatic drama to evolve to spill his beans, and eventually escapes James Bond-style.OK, so the first 60 minutes are great, the rest is a bit lacklustre. Still a remarkable movie overall, if a pretty fictionalised one. Keep in mind that it's not biographical and take it as an occasion to do a bit of reading-up on Uganda.",7,0,1,12 March 2009
"Hail, Caesar!"," It's no Llewyn Davis
","... but just another Coens brothers film. This time there is actually a plot (something that's often missing from a Coen movie): We follow top notch movie exec Eddie Mannix through 27 hours of his extremely busy schedule. Although he has lucrative offers to switch to a real company, one which builds bombs and planes rather than make razzle dazzle movies, eventually he decides to stay on.There is a plethora of plots underway, most importantly the star of sandals epic 'Hail, Caesar!' (about the life of Jesus Christ) gets, well, kidnapped by Hollywood's communist conspiracy writers. Joe McCarthy tried to warn us of these SOBs, Arthur Millar tried to warn us of a supposed modern-day witchhunt, but the Coens finally managed to capture them all in full glorious detail. Nothing witchy about them. They love Joe Stalin, they are portly intellectuals who could bore the hell out of a dead sloth, and they conspire against the US of A. Thanks for the heads-up, Coens! I had great fun. Many scenes are brilliant, unknown actors star, stars appear in bit parts. Again, an excellent movie. If you don't like it, you probably never liked their movies in the first place, so stop whining about how disappointed you are.",8,0,1,7 March 2016
American Gangster," American Great Movie
","I knew next to nothing about this movie before renting it, and when I saw that it was running at close to three hours, I expected to be colossally bored by another vanity epic. But then I was riveted, my head blew off and my eyes melted. I sat transfixed in front of the tube not thinking about the time, and after the titles rolled I started to watch the director's-comments version until I was forced into bed because the birdies started to tweet outside. What a movie.Ridley Scott simply strikes a right balance between action and authenticity. It's like a triple whopper with extra onions which is entirely made out of organically harvested yogurt. OK, that sounds gross but you get the point.While it's the many garish scenes of action, sex and brutality that keep the viewer's interest (let's be honest, folks), many of the subtler scenes stuck with me. For example when crime don Lucas buys his mother a lavish home (a gangster movie staple, big gangsters always buy their mum a nice house), there is also a brief scene in which he shows her a dresser he has had made for her, which is a copy of one which the family has had repossessed many years ago. Or later there is a brief scene where his mother tries to set him straight for planning to murder a bunch of cops. Or how Lucas chats up his later wife. These scenes strike home amidst all the mayhem.Another thing that this movie gets right is that it shows Lucas as being, maybe very clever, but not a criminal mastermind. He does make mistakes, and they do come after him. And while he may think of himself as a gentleman, we also see his unbridled brutality lurking under this veneer.Two things which I didn't 'buy' from this movie:* the scene where Frank Lucas shoots a rival point blank in the head and in coram publico: that would be a pretty stupid thing to do as murder isn't exactly legal, not even in New York City, and Lucas isn't stupid.* Richie Roberts and the women: Roberts is the hard man women think is good to find. I get it. But the endless stream of foxy attorneys and salacious stewardesses who beg him to 'Furp me like a cop' is just a bit too puerile (or maybe I'm jealous).Anyway, great movie.",9,0,1,4 December 2008
The Reader," Wrong on so many levels
","Recently two German movies (Jud Süß -- Film ohne Gewissen and Goethe!) were summarily scolded for not being historically accurate enough. The critics that agreed should better steer well clear of 'Der Vorleser', which ploughs through complex issues such as sexual abuse and the Nazi dictatorship like an icebreaker through a box of Ben And Jerry's. In a nutshell: in the 1950ies, a 15-year-old boy who looks surprisingly like a 25-year-old underwear model, begins a sexual relationship with a sexy older woman. As it turns out, she's illiterate and lets the guy read to her -- strictly the classics, of course. It's one of those sexual- sensual scenes that chicks go all mushy over. When her employer is about to find out that she's illiterate, she runs away from the job and her lover. Years later, the boy is fully grown into a law student and meets his lover again, this time she's tried for having been an SS guard and having let 300 prisoners burn to death. Again, she doesn't want to let out that she's illiterate (and therefore couldn't have written an incriminating report) she is being sentenced to prison for life. Twenty years later she is about to be let go, and her former lover -- who knew all the time that she was innocent but for some reason did nothing to free her -- accepts to take care of her (pretty creepy lack of responsibility on the side of the authorities there), but there is a sudden turn of events ...As it is, the movie is a flood of sensual images stapled together by a ludicrous and highly irritating story. Possibly the book was a lot better because you can be much subtler in writing.",3,6,14,9 November 2010
Dark Shadows," Dark Shadows, bad dialogues
","Dark Shadows is visually a great Tim Burton movie, but the script is totally insufficient. It's based on the eponymous late-1960ies soap opera, which is still one of the longest TV series (in terms of episodes) in history. I didn't know about the series, and it's hard to gauge how many out of the 2012 audience have it on their radar -- very few will have actually seen it. Director Tim Burton is apparently a huge fan of the series, which may have lead to him getting carried away. Or maybe condensing 1125 episodes into a 90 minutes feature film is an impossible feat to begin with. What Burton came up with is the story of a 200 year old vampire resurfacing in the colourful early 1970ies (roughly the era when the run of the original series ended), which is mainly characterised by macramé, troll dolls and Alice Cooper. And a few stoner hippies. Unlike the original series, the 2012 feature film is a comedy, and the culture clash between the ancient vampire and his modern-age family and surroundings could have been a functional plot motor, but unfortunately it falls completely flat because the script -- and especially the dialogues -- sucks. Hard to fathom in a movie that cost US$ 150 million. The result is a movie that is so disappointing that I can't even recommend it for home viewing.",6,1,1,15 December 2012
Inception," Shock-And-Awe style of filmmaking
","'Inception' is certainly the cinematic equivalent to a roller coaster ride. It also features unique, creative imagery, and an equally creative premise: a company has created a technology to intrude dreams to manipulate thoughts. They can insert hired dreamers into one person's dream, ideally with the intruders knowing they're on a job and the target dreamer being unaware that he is being manipulated.To make things even more complicated, dreamers can dream within dreams, and things happen faster in dreams than in reality. And 'inserters' can create places and settings and adopt different appearances. This makes the setup pretty complicated to understand -- you probably won't get it all in the first viewing. To aggravate matters, the rest of the plot is long and winding like the Chinese wall, and action-packed like a He-Man episode.I'd call this a big-explosions blockbuster with brains. Personally I wasn't able to fully buy the premise -- for all the action, I didn't see how burglaring a dream could lead to change one person's thoughts, so I wasn't able to sit back and enjoy it as much as I'd have liked to.",6,3,6,2 September 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Good, but no Ritchie
","I'm a huge fan of director Guy Ritchie's firstlings, 'Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch', two movies dealing with petty criminals on the streets of London with infective humour and a great, high-velocity visual style. Then Ritchie married Madonna and turned out a load of cinematic rubbish. Now the newlydiv is back with Sherlock Holmes, not your regular, stout Sherlock but a superhero flick set in Victorian times.I'm not too sure about the result. As a retrograde superhero movie it works great. If that's your thing. Ritchie still knows his stuff, and Robert McDowney Jr. (Sherlock) and Jude Law (Watson) are impressive. On the other hand, great superhero movies are a dime a dozen, and Guy Ritchie used to be unique when he was still making small-budget films.I weep a tear for the good old times and curse Madonna.",8,0,0,20 September 2010
The Waterboy," Brainless, And No Fun
","With so many people stating that this movie is 'brainless fun' you have to worry.  I can only agree with the former part of that statement -- there isn't a funny moment in it unless you are tickled by a Southern retard making it big in football -- oops, major spoiler, I just revealed the entire plot, sorry.  Anyway it certainly, definitely, for sure isn't intelligent, so why bother.  I saw it on TV and was just stunned by the lack of everything that makes a movie, the only entertaining bit was seeing Cathy Bates in the most humiliating role of her distinguished career, if you are into that sort of thing.  And if that wasn't bad enough, it was actually a CLONE of an EARLIER, equally DISMAL, Adam Sandler flick ('Happy Gilmore'), only this time it's with football rather than golf, AND both movies were major box office hits!  Please gag me with a tongue depressor before I start ranting about a world inhabited by morons with too much money to spend ... there, I did it.",1,1,3,28 April 2002
Stalag 17," Nazi Prison Camp Rigmarole
","Stalag 17 is easily the strangest movie I've ever seen. It's a whodunnit, a slapstick comedy, a thriller, and a gritty war movie, all rolled into one. Made by people, Billy Wilder among them, who knew full well about the horrors of Nazi camps, and a mere eight years after the end of the war. And this wild concoction managed to snaffle an Oscar and was later ripped off as a TV series. Wow.While this has some hallmarks of Billy Wilder's genius, it's simply too wild a mixture. I never knew whether to laugh about the prison guards or to be afraid of them, and ended up doing neither. For the same reason the suspense doesn't work. The humour from the comedic trio Animal, Shapiro and Sgt. Schulz ('Do you speaken ze German?' - 'Ya!' - 'Then droppen Sie dead!') or Marko The Mailman ('Alright, at ease, at ease!') was a bit too low-brow and grinding for my taste, and eventually got onto my nerves.Watch out for the evil Nazi camp commander played by Otto Preminger, an Austro-Hungarian Jew like Wilder. I'm sure he had a blast in his role.While it's probably safe to say that no real POW camp was much like the depicted Stalag 17, the movie wasn't that far off the mark in many aspects. For an Anglo-American or French POW, life at such a camp probably was an ambivalent experience. I guess the jovial rapport between the prisoners and guardsman Schulz, for example, wasn't entirely without precedent. But don't make the mistake of mixing up the relatively sheltered situation at camps for Western POWs with the situation of Russian POWs (who were routinely murdered), the situation in concentration camps inside the Reich or even the large extermination camps in Eastern Europe.Incidentally, I visited the memorial site of a real Stalag the day after I saw the movie. The contrast couldn't have been bigger. While the depicted Stalag 17 was like a summer camp behind barbed wire set in idyllic California, the camp I visited was an enormous, industrialised affair, with many tens of thousands of prisoners from all around the globe. And the nearby camp of foxy female prisoners was sadly lacking.The title is erroneous, by the way. A POW camp set inside of the German empire would have been numbered with Roman numerals, i. e. 'Stalag XVII'.Anyway, the movie. Like I said, it's a mixed bag, and hasn't aged too well. There are better Billy Wilder movies.",6,3,5,31 August 2008
Arrival," Departure (from the cinema)
","I just watched the original 'Alien' movie, which was made in 1979. Incredible. And then this botched remake of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. And then I had to take in the stellar reviews here on IMDb. Wow.Where did it all go wrong? When was the collective decision made that movies are great just because they have an uplifting message? 'Arrival' starts with an interesting premise, twelve spaceships suddenly appear all over the globe, and in the USA a linguist is dispatched to communicate with the aliens. And they always take along a canary bird for some reason. OK, that's great so far. I guess the big payoff is that the aliens look like octopi buuuuuuuuuut they have only seven legs and are caring-sharing-karma-believing hippies who want to help us out so that we will help them out in, like, three millenia. By talking in whalesong.All over the world, the greatest minds are trying to establish some sort of understanding with the spacefreaks, but then Amy Adams, or the scientist she's playing, has the wonderful idea to write down the sentence 'Hi, I'm Amy' on a piece of paper, and the aliens are like: Wow, we traveled over hundred of lightyears, and wanted to communicate with you in writing, but we wanted YOU to initiate it. And now you did! Let me throw some circles at you! And Amy's like: Oh finally, CIRCLES! Why, that's so much easier to decode than the whalesong you did before, let me draw some scientificy-looking vectors, and there! I've solved it! And by the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis I can now look into the future! And that totally explains all the weird flashbacks throughout the movie! But most of all: OMG, the protagonist is a woman scientist!

Trainspotting," Who Needs Immaculate, Just Excellent Is Good Enough For Me
","I have just watched this movie for the umpteenth time, and throughly enjoyed it for the umpteenth time, so I would be hard pressed to say anything negative about it.  Expertly balanced dialogue, visuals, acting, music, each element on its own is excellent, and together they make for a memorable cinematic experience.  Hell, even the graphic design of the print advertisements (which were used to promote this movie when it came out, and also on the book cover) were nothing less than seminal.  So my obvious conclusion is, if you haven't yet seen it, go see it, if you have already seen it, you could do a lot worse than to watch it once again.Still, I have some problems with, not the film itself, but its popular perception and media reception.  There has been a lot of hubbub about whether this film glorifies drug abuse or truthfully 'tells it as it is', or that it even carries a stern 'don't do drugs' message.  I think that this discussion entirely misses the point, and that Trainspotting (the film) takes neither of these three attitudes.  It simply uses a fascinating (yes, squalor on celluloid mostly IS fascinating, end of discussion!) setting to showcase several interesting and entertaining episodes, the bottom line being entertainment, as opposed to documentation, education or political statement.  There is no morality here.  War movies use a war setting, detective movies use a crime setting, and who would claim that 'American Pie' was a truthful portrayal of American high school and college life in the early years of the third millennium?  Expecting Trainspotting to break the mould and be both brilliant entertainment and a brutally honest documentary wrapped in one is simply asking too much.  Just enjoy it for what it is.And to anyone still sounding off about how Trainspotting is an accurate portrayal of addiction in mid - Nineties Edinburgh -- have you been there, at that time, in that scene, and lived to tell?  Not bleeding likely, boyo. Please shut up.",Null,0,1,3 April 2002
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Ice cold entertainment
","I instantly regretted having gone to see this with my nephew. It all seemed to be heading straight to Overlylineardevelopmentsville: the old team of Mannie (the mammoth), Sid (the sloth) and Diego (the sabre-toothed tiger, which are not real tigers, by the way) is split up because Mannie has gone square and founded a family. Sid then decides to do likewise and adopts three eggs, which gets him into all sorts of hilariously predictable scrapes ... but after about 10 minutes the story picks up speed, stops being anal about plot development and promoting family values, and just delivers punch after punch. You see, underneath the ice, our three friends discover a lost world where slapstick and fart jokes reign king! Overall, a very successful third episode from the Ice Age venture (and the umpteenth instalment of Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World plot). The lost world is beautifully done, and I especially liked the new character of Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg), a hyperactive weasel who compliments the often very staid characters of Manni, Diego and Sid nicely.And Scrat the nut-fancying rodent finally finds happiness -- and loses it again ...",8,1,3,20 July 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," The Die Hard franchise becomes run-of-the-mill action movie
","If you're into effects-driven action and unwavering heroes with hairy chests, then Die Hard 4.0 will be right up your street. Brainless fun where helicopters are taken down by running cars up an improvised ramp (made out of cars) and computer software makes chirping noises like a teletype. It's a Bruce Willis movie, so you can't really complain about the lack of realism. His co-stars -- Tim Olyphant, Justin Long -- are remarkably good. My only real regret is that the unique premise of the Die Hard movies has been scrapped. In the original run, John McClane is an antihero who just wanted to pick up a pint of milk at his local 7-Eleven (or something along those lines) and then got engaged by international terrorists, a fact which he bitterly and repeatedly contemplated throughout the rest of the movie. That stance made the series so unique and so much fun to watch. To bad it evaporated.",5,1,3,6 January 2013

Munich," Unfortunately 'Courageous' Doesn't Equate 'Good Movie'
","After the Oscar-awarded but factually flawed 'One Day In September' I was really curious how Spielberg would treat the subject. And judging by the media hooplah, Spielberg had apparently gone off his rocker and turned out a shlocker that advocated the complete annihilation of Israel, or something to that effect. As it turned out, 'Munich' falls short of both counts -- it's mostly an action movie with little regard for historical accuracy that seeks to propagate an agenda that I would term 'slightly mellowed Zionism'. I would have thought that Spielberg's position is in accordance with what seems to be official doctrine, that the existence of Israel is non-negotiable and that Israel has the right to defend herself, but that she is not simply awarded carte blanche for doing so. Strangely, judging by the uproar surrounding this movie, I seem to have been out of synch with reality in that at least a large part of media commentators seems to assume that Israelis are beyond the pale of moral considerations and somehow invested with unalienable right to act with complete impunity.But back to the movie. It's actually quite convincing as a sort of alternative James Bond movie, one in which the hero is married with children and has moral qualms, but as such it almost mandatorily falls short of its claim as a polical movie or as a truthful -- if not factually accurate -- portrayal of a historical event. Maybe you can't have both, or at least Spielberg, in this case, couldn't. The film eventually hits rock-bottom in an unforgivable scene in which Avner and his wife play a round of 'hide the kreplach' interspersed by stroboscopic takes from the final shootout of the Munich hijack.",Null,0,3,8 March 2006
What We Do in the Shadows," At last, a vampire movie that doesn't suck
","I'm in the twilights of my years and no longer part of 'Generation Twilight', so initially I wasn't so hot on a vampire mockumentary. The idea seemed good enough for maybe 30 minutes of comedy, and not for a full feature movie. But What We Do In The Shadows is brilliantly done and really buckets of fun. It rides on the great actors, but also on a wonderful script and an ingenious mix of wobbly 'porno camera' and perfectly placed special effects. The movie addresses various aspects of being a vampire in New Zealand today:* sunlight leaking into your habitat* vampire wannabes hassling you* virgins can be incredibly hard to get by* Wellington itself feels so dead you constantly have to remind yourself that you're actually undead* discrimination is rife against immigrants (especially blood-sucking vampires from Transsylvania like yourself)* same goes doubly for Nazi vampires* feminist 'familiars' (servants) constantly bickering while they're ironing your frills* werewolves and vampire hunters constantly riding your ass* mortal friends and chums frequently dieing off* flatmates refuse to do bloody dishesSo you don't have to be part and parcel of the vampire hype to dig this flick.

The Hangover Part III," What's with all the flak?
","OK, so I actually loved this movie. Hangover 3 manages to pull off the near impossible (and super rare) feat of being true to the original while presenting a fresh story. In part one, I'll remind you, four friends travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, but instead of a few pleasant antics involving alcohol, recreational drugs and maybe a one-night-stand they wake up with their lives in complete disarray and without a clue as to what happened the previous night. Part 2 was kinda the same deal, but this time in Bangkok. Part 3 starts off completely differently: Alan has finally lost it, and the wolfpack sets off to take him to the looney bin. Then they end up in Tijuana, Chow turns up, and it looks as if we're in for another Hangover, this time in the Mexicali. Then things take a completely unexpected turn.I would bet good money that you will love the third installment if you were partial to the humour of the original film. If you're not into its innovative but very physical and crude humour, then you should obviously steer well clear of the sequel.What I don't get are all the highly negative reviews, both on and off IMDb. Much of what I read is just plain wrong. The jokes a spot on. The plot is anything but a sad rehash of Hangovers one and two. There is no obvious or excessive product placement (if there is any). And so forth. Hangover 3 is bound to be one of the best comedies of this year, and even my girlfriend liked it. So there.",10,9,13,4 June 2013
The Thin Red Line," War poem
","To its credit, The Thin Red Line is a novel approach to the war movie genre, which otherwise tends to be rather formulaic. It's a war movie that also tries to display the thoughts of its characters, and it visually showed me the war in the Pacific in a way I hadn't seen before -- for instance, by showing us not just soldiers but at least some of the native inhabitants of the islands (although basically as mute savages).I didn't really enjoy the long poetic stretches though, at least not on DVD. I thought they were too elaborate, too well formulated to be realistic, and too ditzy. It's something that came across better when I saw this movie for the first time in a proper cinema.The narration has its flaws, too. It was only after I read the synopsis on Wikipedia that I learned that Pt Witt had gone AWOL with the natives prior to the main events of the film; before, I always wondered how he got to hang out with them. Apparently the movie was heavily rearranged during editing and many scenes ended up on the cutting room floor (I would have loved to have seen Mickey Rourke in this!), so that may account for the choppy narration. It's also difficult to follow the individual story threads as the film switches around quite a bit, and those actors all look pretty much alike (all Latin lover types except Nick Nolte).Oh, and I thought that the shell-shocked soldier ranting on about 'Leaves! In the wind! That's what we are!' was too histrionic.So, this movie may not live up to all its aspirations, but it's still absolutely watchable. And as always in war movies there are muscular, rippling torsoes a-plenty, if that's your cup of tea.",7,0,0,3 March 2009
Spectre," Let's shut down the 00 section. To shake things up a bit.
","Was there ever a Bond film that didn't work on the premise of a new MI6 boss, home secretary or pizza delivery boy wanting to shut down the double-oh section because it's obsolete now we have the railway, manned flight or the internet? Why doesn't someone tell them? 'We've tried to shut them down, honestly, we did. Then we realised it's a shite idea that always ends up with us being dead villains. But if you really must, please don't let Bond 'say goodbye to Q first' before he leaves the building.' After the fairly novel plot of Skyfall comes a run-of-the-mill Bond adventure with the women being somewhat less foxy and more self-assured than they were a few years ago. Only Monica Bellucci is a throwback to old times and gets horny just from hearing Bond talk about gunning down villains (including her husband). It's good to know that there are still old-school foxes around.Spectre is another Bond movie. But not an especially distinctive one.",7,5,21,5 November 2015
Happy Feet," No story, no fun, no point
","Me and my girlfriend watched this for half an hour and then unanimously decided to give up on it, which doesn't happen often. In retrospect I found out that this even won an Academy Award for best animated movie of the year: wow, it must have been a very dire year for animated movies - - or otherwise this is further proof how worthless the Oscar really is as indicator for good movies.Basically this is March Of The Penguins as a computer-animated cartoon with a bit of humour thrown in. They tried to make this look relatively realistic and non-anthropomorphic rather than cute and cuddly. In consequence, the movie is still far too unrealistic to be educational or enlightening, and it isn't very entertaining either. The jokes are few and not that good, the dialogues not that witty, and the plot is pretty inane: a penguin couple hatches an 'odd' chick which stumbles strangely. A little later we learn that every penguin has its 'heartsong' (pass the sick bag, please), except for our little penguin, who prefers to dance (incidentally, the dancing isn't that impressive, probably because animated tapdancing rarely is). He is ostracised by his peers but starts to win the heart of this penguin girl. At this point I switched off. What probably would have followed is a story about inclusiveness (it's OK to be different) and to thy own self be true.Incidentally, we saw another but excellent animated movie about penguins immediately afterward, Surf's Up, which I can highly recommend. Just to show you that I'm not biased against penguin-themed cartoons per se.",2,1,2,9 August 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Indian Love Story
","Slumdog Millionaire tells a fairy tale of a young Indian 'slumdog' (i. e. slum dweller) who wins his childhood love, alongside a handsome cash prize of two million rupees, through the Indian edition of the internationally popular game show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. With each question, we get to see another chapter from his life, starting as a young kid working on a skip, until we return to the present of him working as a humble chai wallah (the Indian male version of a tea and cakes lady) in a call center.I'm a big fan of Danny Boyle, and as usual his visual style packs a lot of punch. But this time the story is terribly thin and cheesy. Romantic as it may be, I don't buy that someone can fall in love at the age of about 6, and for this love to work when he's a young man. And I don't buy that someone who barely learned to read and write can win the jackpot at WWTBAM.That's not 'modern fairy tale', that's just bad storytelling. Sorry.",5,3,3,8 July 2010
The Breakfast Club," John Hughes' Spruce Goose Equivalent
","Like anyone with a set of eyes and a video cassette recorder I'm favorably disposed to a great number of John Hughes movies (what's there not to like?) but 'The Breakfast Club' is a bit of a porker.  A bit like 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' without the humor and the action -- I can only suspect that Hughes got a whiff of the vapors and wanted to do a 'serious', 'introspective', 'sensitive' movie for a change and for me it just didn't work out.  Though lots of other commentators obviously think otherwise, but then there's got to be some people who keep Schwarzenegger in office and the Twinkie-makers in business.  The characters are unintentionally, comically overdrawn -- the prospective prom queen with a rich beemer-drivin', divorce-undergoing daddy, the bad-to-the-bones-but-really-quite-sensitive-rebel who rebels so hard as to make Charles Manson look like a pushover, the brainy nerd with an overambitious mom and latin-, math- AND physics-club memberships (and he's a virgin and his mum packs his lunch), the disturbed artist chick with self-harm-, body hygiene- and eating disorder-issues and the jock, who's just a complete jock, OK?  And then there's the evil teacher (why does everyone in this forum think he's the principal?  which principal has to go in on a Saturday to supervise detention?) and the janitor with a heart of gold who's really a philosopher.  Not just a social dropout.  In short, it would have been nice to have at least ONE character who's not from the teen-movie identikit.  Next, the plot is so paper-thin (some kids bond during a really long and tedious detention) that some gratuitous action scenes were thrown in just to get some movement on the screen -- too bad that John Hughes didn't care to think the plot through more thoroughly when he was writing it.  (But to compensate he chose to throw in that totally patronizing and sappy ugly duckling makeover -- goth chick puts on some lippy, a white dress and a hairband and instantly bags a boyf -- bring me a bag, I think I'm going to be sick.)  Then there's the predictable blame-it-all-on-your-parents mumbo jumbo which seems to have been lifted straight from the great book of teenager psychology (in my experience, teenagers may think like that but they never talk this way -- and if they do, I don't care to see a feature-length movie about it).  And finally, at the end everyone acts like they have had this life-changing experience and jump-started a revolution.But I'm being a bit harsh.  The acting is generally very decent (totally unlike today's teen movie fare) and I give Hughes credit for trying to take a compassionate, engaged view on teenagers.  So overall it's a movie that bears watching, even though it consider it to be far removed from it's ascribed cult status.",Null,4,7,12 February 2004
Gladiator," Too Long And Not Very Good
","In German there is a good expression for movies such as Gladiator (G): 'Historienfilm' -- it means that it is a movie which has a historic backdrop, but is not a movie ABOUT history.  What worries me is that many people will think that G is realistic, that the historic context of it or even the entire story are accurate, which is not the case.I found the movie definitely too long -- it would be much better if it had been cut by 45 or 60 minutes.  The story line was too pompous, without much suspense, and ordinary.  The 'look and feel' (camerawork, lighting, sound track, decoration, casting, etc.) is high quality, though too glossy and commercial - like for my taste.  As for believability -- oh well.  Maybe seen from America ancient Germany is just a quick horse ride away from Rome and right next to a gladiator training center in the middle of the desert, but trust me -- it is not.  And I do understand that there has to be a bad guy, but did it have to be a hare - lipped, father - killing, sister - fancying, paedophile dictator?  And did the good guy have to be such a sickly - sweet mixture of George Washington, Rambo and Walt Whitman?  And -- on a slightly jingoistic note -- if the ancient Germans were such club - swinging barbarians ('hunh?  cavalry attack from back, that no fair'), how come the Romans never did capture the territory?Conclusion:  if the movie had been shortened, I would have found it OK to watch on the small screen (rental or free TV).  As it is, I did not like it. And I find it depressing that such a great director as Ridley Scott seems to have dedicated himself to producing glossy, mind numbing garbage.",2,0,2,3 March 2001
Contact," Bizarrely Bad
","Have you ever wondered why SF movies always seem to feature the same elements, warp drive spaceships that make WOOSH sounds in vacuum, laser guns, nuclear grenades, super fast computers that take 2 seconds to fill a screen with graphics a C64 could handle, the Russian female scientist in a tight fitting t-shirt who at one point discovers that she is only a woman after all and needs some sexual healing from her American colleague, slime - filled aliens who look like oversized cockroaches, swirling galaxies, astronaut uniforms that have more flags and labels on them than a formula 1 racing overall, etc.?  It is because, even though that stuff is naff and repetitive, it is somehow enjoyable to watch.  'Contact', on the other hand, desperately tries to be intelligent and different ('hey, our spaceships don't even move'), only to arrive at an even greater level of naffness. Funny that so many reviewers on IMDB seem to have enjoyed this movie.  All it did to me was to see Star Wars instead or read a good philosophy book.",Null,2,3,15 April 2001
The Great Gatsby," Are my mom and famous Hollywood director Baz Luhrman ONE AND THE SAME PERSON?
","Director Baz Luhrman narrates the story of 'The Great Gatsby' the way my mother would: linearly, as a third-person narrator, and always trying to wow you with depictions. 'So he's driving this big car, yeah? REALLY big and expensive car, yeah? And he's driving it REALLY fast, yeah?' until I cave in and go like: 'Wow, now I get it, really big car, huh? I'm impressed, please proceed with the plot.' Another thing they have in common: They never fecking listen to me, but when THEY tell a story, they suddenly have all the time in the world. In the case of The Great Gatsby, almost two and a half hours.Oh, and my mom and Baz Luhrman also share this: plausibility, logic, positivism -- they all mean sheet when they are telling THEIR stories. 'Hey mom, so he's this mousy bank clerk and cousin twice removed of this famously beautiful debutante and her millionaire sports champion husband, how come he's always hanging out with them?' -- 'Shut up when we're talking, son!'And the music didn't really work, either. Jay-Z kinda tries to cross over from contemporary hip-hop to 1920ies Jazz and Swing, cute idea, but it turns out as muzak.Consequently, I found 2h20m of this movie hard to sit through. Kind of like when I have to listen to my mom's old chestnuts.",2,4,8,18 August 2013
The Simpsons Movie," Yellow Jell-O
","I saw the Simpsons Movie on DVD three days ago, and already I couldn't tell you the plot -- it had something to do with a gigantic glass dome over Springfield, or other. It was an entertaining roller-coaster ride of an episode and in wide screen and longer and yellower, but overall the quality of the plot and the gags was below that of one of the better TV episodes. I had the impression that the makers couldn't wait to get their hands on their profits, and that consequently not a lot of love an dilligence went into the production.Overall, the movie was entertaining but also a bit of a let-down, especially after the brilliant 3D-bunny-rabbit commercial. You will get better mileage out of watching a few classic episodes.",Null,1,3,16 June 2008
All the President's Men," I you liked this movie hang up before I count to -- hello?
","I think I can sum up this movie rather succinctly: great on style and acting, but paper thin on narration. If you are willing to invest the time to read the original Woodward / Bernstein book beforehand, you might be in for a treat -- the movie offers the same story, but with a cool soundtrack and some real babes thrown in. Personally, I haven't read the book and am not too clued about the whole affair, and consequently I might as well have watched the whole thing in Chinese. This is not the type of movie which takes the average interested-but-clueless viewer by the hand and gently guides him through the narrative. It's the type of movie which hits you over the head with a phone book and then expects you to know the number of Newman, Wilbur on 1024 Beech Ave (Glenwood). Talking heads turn up, say a few cryptic things, names are thrown about, everyone gets real excited, and I get an eerie déja-vu feeling of when I took that semiotics course in college. If there is someone who equally watches this movie equally unprepared and gets everything in it, I would like to congratulate him and shake him by the hand, but I can't claim the same for me.Oh yeah, and the ending was a bit of a let-down. And I thought that the 'Please confirm this information indirectly by doing something silly'-schtick wore real thin towards the end as well.",Null,0,2,19 March 2008
The Island," I can't believe I made myself sit through the whole movie!
","OK, based on a story by HG Wells (allegedly), directed by Michael Bay, starring Steve Buscemi and Ewan McGregor. Could have been interesting. Turned out awful. And just farrrr too long.You have to hand it to Michael Bay. He can turn any plot into a Michael Bay movie. You fax him a script about, say, an elderly Moldavian lesbian finding true love amidst the Biafra famine, and bang, there'll be a car chase with helicopters that ends up in a disused warehouse (just where does he find all those disused warehouses?). Here he does Kafka. And dystopic science fiction.The movie starts out in an eerie ultra-modern environment in the near future. If you don't instantly get the feeling that 'things might not be as they seem' you should check your pulse. I saw this on DVD and paused it after 45 minutes, and actually had a bad dream afterwards. Then our heroes escape to the real world and the movie gets interesting for about ten minutes, mainly due to the increased screen presence of Steve Buscemi. Then it goes into terminal coma again. It looks nice and all, but it's never engaging and just too damn ridiculous.My word is to avoid this; people who want action will be annoyed about all the tedious 'critical reflection of our society today' bits, people who want deep, introspective, mind-boggling stuff will just not buy into the story and their minds will go unboggled. This is the stuff that Uwe Boll always gets castigated for. Thanks for reading.",4,0,0,26 February 2009
