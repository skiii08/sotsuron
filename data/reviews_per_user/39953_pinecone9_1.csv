The Blair Witch Project," Excellent
","At my age, I'm surprised that any movie could genuinely scare me anymore, but this one surprisingly succeeded. Maybe the key was that it had so much 'realism' in it, and in cases like this, perhaps less is more. A very well done terrifying masterpiece! Proof that a low budget movie can be just as good as one with a lavish budget. The creators and directors must be geniuses. I'd like to see the footage they scrapped, too. Even the name 'Rustin Parr' is too perfect! Can't think off hand on how this movie could be improved except I wish it was longer.",10,2,3,28 June 2001
