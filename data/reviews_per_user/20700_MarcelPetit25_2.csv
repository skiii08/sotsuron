The Longest Yard," Great - not better than the original - but great watch
","I have to say this is a very entertaining movie - I do have to say Kevin Nash stole the show from everyone - good for him - he deserves it - Steve Austin character was boring(too bad) - Nelly's character could have been better also - Chris Rock, well he never changes he either is funny or not - most times in movies unless he is doing his stand-up he is not funny - Burt Reynolds is always good to see, he is such a talent and a forgotten talent that should be used more in movies - Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone that asks me about it - The character Turley was amazingly huge - wow where did they find him - The one thing that I do have to say it is to bad that this is the only type of movie that the old crews from the WWE can be in - which is to bad - Have fun with this movie and enjoy - I wish they would have put more fumbles and screw ups on this DVD also - The soundtrack is great too - I had to go buy it after watching this movie - good music to listen to -I have not tired of it yet - Take care and have good time watching this movie",Null,0,2,18 October 2005
The Machinist," Excellent
","Good Movie - Worth watching - Mr.Bale pulls off an amazing performance - Writing was great - Bale with his weight loss added to the his and the movie's freakishness - glad to see it was not too predictable either - Mr Bale only gets better - I hope he does a lot of parts like this rather than try to get to mainstream - This is one the best movies of the year, no doubt about it - With more people watching and hearing about it - It will live on for quite a while - From the start to the end we are brought into a strange, strange world and what a ride we go on - I want to tell everyone to watch this movie - Enjoy this movie and enjoy Bale's performance - There is also the talented Jennfier Jason Leigh who I can't say anything bad about her - she is amazing in anything she does",Null,1,1,24 July 2005
