The Ring," Worthy Interpretation Of A Horror Masterpiece!
","As a fan of the original Japanese version of 'Ring' ('Ringu') I am pleased to say that 'The Ring' (starring the great Naomi Watts from the David Lynch masterpiece 'Mulholland Drive') for the most part complements the original cycle of films and stands as one of the best American horror pictures of recent years.At first I thought the film had already blown it in the first scene. Hideo Nakata's original opens with a nod to horror movies like 'Scream', only Japanese style.  The American take on the same scene however, seemed to speed up the telling of the urban myth that sets up the film's premise and came across more like a second rate 'Scream' clone than a well crafted homage. However, as the opening sequence goes on, it's handling improves and it reveals that this remake is quite capable of serving up scares of it's own.The pace is more urgent in this version and the first few days of the curse fly past.  Events and characters also play out differently and much of the revelations are last day rather than spread out.  Such is the tension (a combination of direction and Naomi Watts's brilliant and riveting performance) that I almost completely forgot that something we're led to believe about Rachel (Watts) 's uncovering of the curse and impending doom is a red herring.'The Ring' retains the dreary rainy grey look of Hideo Nakata's original and the music and sound effects are also eerily reminiscent, which helps keep the creepy mood and gives the story anunsettling atmosphere.  There are also a few teasing nods to scenes and events from the Japanese sequels 'Ring 2' and 'Ring 0: Birthday'.  One of 'The Ring''s strengths though is that it can both complement and differentiate from the Japanese cycle and stand in it's own right.  Sometimes I was unsure of what would play out and how it would play out from the original story.  If you're comfortably familiar with 'Ring' there's still a few surprises in store.  Brian Cox (of 'Manhunter' fame) plays a character who is actually an amalgamation of two characters from the original and the protagonist's mother is a bit different to Shizuko (her Japanese equivalent).  Shockingly so in one crucial scene.  There's also a real heart in your throat scene on the ferry involving a horse which is completely new and very effective.  Another main difference is that Noah initiallly seems oafish and gets properly involved in Rachel's investigation of the cursed tape a lot later on than in the Japanese version.  The film also concentrates more on building a family link between characters making their fate more emotionally important to the viewer.Now to some criticism of the film.  The backstory of Samara and the curse doesn't play out as effectively as that forSadako in 'Ring' (1998) and seems a bit half sketched in comparison. Unfortunately the scary finale is one place (like the initial opening) where this film suffers in comparison to it's predeccesor, seeming more overblown and more sped up at the expense of subtlety and building tension.  This scene did seem to work well enough, it has to be said on audience members who probably hadn't seen the original, judging by their nervous giggles when the credits came up.Overall if you're a fan of horror that dares to be creative and genuinely scary, I'd urge you to see both this well crafted, spine-tingling, supernatural thriller and the terrifying Japanese films that inspired it.",Null,0,0,24 February 2003
Ed Wood," Hilarious and poignant cult masterpiece
","I first saw the real Ed Wood's films 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and 'Night Of The Ghouls' as a kid and had become interested in the fascinating story of the director and his bizarre group of friends and their experiences in later years.  His films are enjoyable and fun (which is more than can be said for a lot of truly awful movies that others have raved about to me).This film is a fitting tribute to Ed's dreams.  I know it has it's inaccuracies but it's never less than true to the spirit of Ed Wood's amazing (and sometimes touching) story.  I even went back and discovered that some of the things I assumed were artistic lisence in the story were actually drawn from Rudolph Grey's book (Nightmare Of Ecstacy). Much of the film is hilarious and has a lot of quirky humour and bizarre moments.  There are also some beautifully poignant moments and a definitesadness to some parts of the film.    The style of the film is great and really recreates the atmosphere of Ed's movies and also accounts of his life. Shooting it in black and white was an inspired and bold move on director Tim Burton's part and is an example of his obvious affinity with the material. There were many colourful characters in Edward D Wood Jnr's life and the film really captures them and almost makes you want to join in with his wild dreams and eccentric films.  The cast is uniformly excellent. Johnny Depp, apart from being in some of my favourite films(Cry-Baby and Ed Wood) is also one of the finest actors around and has an interesting film career (Sleepy Hollow, From Hell, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Edward Scissorhands etc).  He's a great choice for the lead role and gives the film a lot of energy and wit.  Martin Landau (Space:1999, Cleopatra) is truly excellent as Bela Lugosi and it's great to see him acting alongside hi lovely, talented daughter in some scenes.  Martin Landau provides many laughs in the film but also some of it's more poignant moments and makes you feel true sympathy for Bela in the film.  Juliet Landau (Drusilla in Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel) is perfect for quirky character roles and is a delight here. Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex And The City, Mars Attacks! )has some great bitchy moments and is another great actress.  Patricia Arquette (True Romance, A Nightmare On Elm Street 3) is sweet in her role and brings out the poignancy of Ed's following his dreams.  Both Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray are great in their roles.  Criswell was a bizarre character and I enjoyed the real person's opening monologues in Ed's pictures. The film is mostly funny up to and including the making of'Bride Of The Monster' but gets sadder and grimmer for a period when dealing with Bela's addiction and time in hospital but the film gets funny again for the making of 'Plan 9'.  The end gives the viewer some additional information about some of the main people portrayed and the film ends on a beautiful note (even though the reality for the characters isn't so great).  Ed's left in the film with his dreams of fame and the film is an inspiration to dreamers and non-conformists everywhere.  Funny and sad and always fascinating.  Another stroke of genius from Tim Burton.",10,0,0,2 November 2002
Mulholland Drive," Adventures of a Jitterbug!
","I love this movie!  From some of the reviews I'd read beforehand I expected it to be a difficult movie (despite being a fan of Lynch) but I really enjoyed it on first viewing and watching it again reveals new things easily missed before.  It's right up there with David Lynch at his finest. The two beautiful female leads both do a wonderful job of separating their dual identities in the movie.  Naomi Watts as Betty is amusingly all 'Gosh, gee!  This is superfun!' through much of the film but gets to show her acting chops in the scene where Betty is auditioning for an acting role and later in the film when she becomes Diane, a tragic victim of unrequited love and guilt in the Boulevard Of Broken Dreams.  Laura Elena Harring is frightened and helpless as Rita but as Carmilla, she becomes more confident and hard edged.  Justin Theroux kind of reminds me of Bruce Campbell in his role as a director and it's great to see 'Twin Peaks' star Michael J Anderson appear in the movie.There's lots of great scenes in the movie including the aforementioned audition, Theroux's meeting with 'The Cowboy' (note the use of electricity in this scene, a familiar motif from David Lynch's other work), the hitman's first scene which reminds me of both Quentin Tarantino and the Coen brothers, the erotic love scene between Betty and Rita which is tender and is there to do more than titillate we male viewersand the surreal and touching scene in the Silencio club.It's great that David Lynch was able to turn his passed over tv pilot into a masterpiece of cinema with his familiar elements. Even by the time we get to the Pandora's Box cliffhanging ending of the pilot, we've been on quite a journey with the two girls, but the second part of the movie is just as interesting in it's way in showing an even darker side of trying to live in the Hollywood illusion.  A great exploration of dreams vs reality and the consequences of guilt.  Often amusing, mysterious, erotic, touching and heartwrenching in it's final revelations.  This film is red hot!",10,2,3,22 January 2003
Halloween," A genuine classic!
","This film is a genuine classic of the horror genre and not for nothing is it the most celebrated of slasher movies.  Contrary to popular myth it's not the first movie of it's kind (nor is the also terrifying 'Black Christmas') but what makes it a classic is the performances, writing, cinematography, editing and above all it's flawlessly crafted by John Carpenter who was at the time a master of his craft.  Not only is his directing effective but his theme for the movie is one of the most recognisable horror film themes and gives the film a sense of ominous foreboding throughout.  The direction also gives a sense of unease to even the daylight scenes. Donald Pleasance, Jamie Leigh Curtis, Charles Cypher, Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles all give great performances in the film and the teen characters are well observed.  The film spends just enough time with the teen characters to convince you that they are believable characters.  Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles have some amusing quips throughout the film that keep the teen scenes enjoyable. Dr Loomis is a great character and Donald Pleasance gives a quirky neurotic performance that can be both amusing and gives some gravitas to the proceedings when he rants about how evil and dangerous Michael Myers is (and the film gives us no reason to doubt this). Some superb scares and thrills throughout.  This film scared the hell out of me when I was a kid and still packs a punch.  One scene in particular will always have you checking the back seat of a car before getting in. The end of the movie when Laurie Strode finds out what has been happening to her friends and discovers that there really is a'boogey man' is tense and gripping throughout up to the end credits.  John Carpenter was my favourite director when I was akid and this is a masterful exercise in why that was.",8,0,0,2 November 2002
