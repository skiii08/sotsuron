Requiem for a Dream," Best Movie of 2000
","This movie is incredibly hard to watch, but well worth it! Best movie of 2000 - Has a way of making you physically uncomfortable. You want to look away but it's almost like your eyes are pried open (like alex in a clockwork orange)Everyone was great in this movie, especially MARLON WAYANS. I never knew he could 'act.' I'm so used to seeing him just make jokes. I'm anxiously awaiting the DVD release.",Null,0,0,11 April 2001
American Beauty," my only complaint...
","I may not be a teenager anymore, but I know for sure teenagers don't talk like the teenagers in this movie do, at least not where I come from!That's my only  complaint, honestly. This movie is touching and hilarious. Kevin Spacey shines in this brilliant performance, but then again, doesn't he always?Wes Bentley is magnificent, as well. I'm very happy to see he hasn't made a string of cheesy movies after this. The score is magnificent, also.",Null,0,0,12 April 2001
