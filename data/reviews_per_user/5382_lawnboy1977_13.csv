The Longest Yard," Tough to do a remake
","This has certainly become a trend in Hollywood lately, remaking classic films with plot revisions and new actors. Occasionally it works, but for the most part, remakes need to be avoided at all costs, this is my opinion with 'The Longest Yard'.The original film is considered one of the greatest sports movies of all time. Paul Crewe takes a rag-tag bunch of convicts up against a well oiled machine of a football team, and on shear determination and the fact that this is their only chance at glory in their prison lives, beats the guards. Classic of course, timeless story, so why not remake it with a more comedic twist and more action packed football scenes including pro-wrestlers and ex-pro football players? The filmmakers got the football scenes right, but not much else.The great thing about the first movie, was that you really felt for the prisoners who were seemingly up against insurmountable odds, not only on the football field, but in life. I never really felt that was established in this movie, which moves way too fast to establish anything.Quite a few scenes were changed, sped up, or completely removed from that were in the original version that took away fro the story in this movie. In this one, Crewe becomes too well liked too quickly, while in the first one, he goes through a long period of earning himself in prison. It never really established Crewe's downfall from pro-football and how much of an impact his point shaving scheme had on his life and those around him.I give this movie a 6 only because the action was up to par and the football scenes were better than the original, which they should have been considering they had a bigger budget and bigger effects.the worst part of this movie is Sandler and Chris Rock. You would think that these two comedic all-stars would be able to write much funnier lines for themselves, but they don't. I have actually been very disappointed by all Chris Rock films, he's a great stand up, but horrible actor.If you want to see a great football movie, rent the original 'Longest Yard'.",6,0,0,6 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Looking back this episode is much better
","This episode of the Star wars saga was criticized by some when it came out for having wooden dialogue and too much digital landscaping to be any good. I wasn't overly impressed with it myself, but having seen all 6 films now, AOTC is actually a very important and well done section of the overall series.Lucas has said time and again that this movies are meant to be seen as one long film, not to be taken as 6 individual movies. This particular installment features so much that affects every other episode. The discovery of the clones, the immaturity and arrogance of Annakin, the beginning of the clone wars. All of these events happen in this one movie, which is actually a lot more than what happens in some of the other films. I don't consider this to be the best of all 6 by any means, but it is certainly not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.",8,292,476,28 November 2005
Spider-Man," Cool flick
","Definitely a good movie.  I was skeptical like everyone of Tobey Maguire as Spiderman.  However, he delivered.  This film would have sucked if there was some overpowering hunk playing Peter Parker As much as I like guys like The Rock and Arnold, it just wouldn't have worked.  I can't wait for a sequel.",8,0,0,5 May 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," dissapointing
","This was a letdown.  I wasn't expecting Pulp Fiction, but I was expecting more than what I got out of this movie.  The movie just dragged on and on. It seems like it was all buildup to vol 2.  My question is why bother with two movies.  Seems likie he could just put everything into one film.  Total letdown.",3,8,13,11 October 2003
Big Fish," More than just a Tim Burton movie
","Most Tim Burton films are wild fantasies glorified by the elaborate characters and settings.  While this film had all that it also contained something much more, a human element.  Films like Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow had this element, but it was always on a much darker level. Big Fish makes the viewer look at themselves and their family.  How does that person relate to his or her father?  That's the truly lasting element of this film is the way it can strike a cord in the heart of the viewer. Compare that with Burton's other films and it's just a little bit more.",8,0,0,10 January 2004
Saw," A lot to be desired
","I don't want to give away too much in this movie, but all i can say is that the amount of buildup an suspense created by this movie leading up to the end, was not worth the ending. This film started out with a good premise, 2 guys trapped in a room with no clue of how they got there or what the point of them being there is. The more this film unravels, despite the shock factor, it is just too far fetched to be believed. There were too many questions left unanswered, what was the deal with the wife and the child? How does the killer actually hunt down his prey and how why does he do it? There wasn't enough motive there it was all based on shock an gore factor, which leaves a lot to be desired.",5,2,3,11 April 2005
Love Actually," Did I miss something?
","I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into watching this film, I just rented it to see what it was all about. I did expect a total love story with a bunch of different characters, which is what the movie pretty much is. I expected more of a connection between all the different stories that for me didn't quite play out the way I expected. I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of British comedies, a lot of the humor just doesn't make sense to me, which might have been my major problem with this film.There were certain elements that really bothered me about this movie though. At the beginning, we see the characters being introduced. One scene has Colin Firth saying goodbye to his girlfriend, saying I love you about 27 times while doing so, while on his way to his French cottage to work on his novel for several weeks. For some reason he falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper who he never says a word to because, alas they don't speak the same language! We never again here from the girlfriend the rest of the movie as he runs off at the end to marry the housekeeper, because he has finally learned to speak Portuguese. That didn't make much sense to me, but I guess running away from someone you say that you love is funny to some people, not to me. I guess the point of that story was that true love exceeds culture and language.Another story that bothered me was the one involving the best friend of a newlywed groom who is secretly in Love with the bride. The bride, Keira Knightley, finds this out when she comes over to view the wedding video, shot by the best friend in a stalker-like fashion where every single frame is a close-up of the bride. She apparently find this to be cute, and doesn't run off in a terrified state of 'oh my god this guy is obsessed with me'!! They don't run off together but still remain friends, for some reason.I think I need to watch this film again with someone who understands it because I felt like a lot of the humor was over my head. I guess since I'm not in love, and rather cynical about it, I didn't quite get a lot of this movie.",7,0,2,23 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Saga is indeed complete
","When George Lucas announced over 10 years ago that he was going to make prequels to his original trilogy, this was the movie everyone was expecting. Everything that happens in this one chapter, ties together all the other 5 movies, completely. Starting with Episode I when Anakin Skywalker was a young child on Tatooine, a lot of what happens in that movie explains why he turns to the dark side. Anakins inability to let go of his past, and constantly worry about his mother, is a major factor that Sidious uses to turn him to the Dark Side of the Force.The way that Skywalker deals with the struggle between good and evil in this film, and faces the decision that would destroy the Jedi and the Republic, is remarkable. There are moments when it looks like he wants to stay a Jedi, and turn Sidious over to his Masters, but in the end he succumbs to temptation, all to save the woman he loves, or so he thinks. Palpatine uses his attachment to Padme to his advantage in order to turn him.We now know why Vader is unaware of his children until the time of Episode V.All in all, this is right up there with Empire and A new Hope as the best of the series. Every question I had about the formation of the Empire, the fall of the Jedi, and the fate of Skywalker, is now answered. The circle is indeed now complete, and the saga will now live on forever!",10,11,15,19 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Masterpiece
","This movie is quite simply one of the greatest of all time.  I have never felt for characters in a movie like I have in this one.  It would have won the Academy Award for best picture if it weren't for Forrest Gump.  I love that movie too, however, I think Shawshank is a more enduring movie.  It's tale is more about the human spirit, and overcoming probably one of the most difficult situations anyone could ever face.",10,0,0,12 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," What more can be said?
","What more can be said about the original Star Wars film, or as we now know it, Episode IV: A New Hope. This movie changed all the rules, and then some. The beauty about this movie is that it has spanned generations of fans and will continue to be passed down to generations of fans as those who love these films share them with their children.My earliest memories of Star Wars are just owning a bunch of toys, and having a few coloring books. I was too young to remember experiencing the films when they were first released, the original came out 2 months before I was born, but that has not affected my fond memories of these films. I really didn't begin to love these movies until I was in high school, sometime in the early 90s. To me that just demonstrates the power and effectiveness of these movies all together. By the time I saw Episode IV, the special effects were old hat, but the stories resonated with me so much, as with anyone else who loves these films, that they will always be my absolute favorites.So much can be said about the Ep IV itself, the fantasy adventure, the groundbreaking effects, the fun and brilliant performances including Alec Guiness who was nominated for Best-Supporting Actor despite his attempts to dist5ance himself from the movies. I recommend anyone who loves Star wars to go out and rent some of his films such as Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai and Ladykillers, all classics.To myself, this original film represents innocence, not only in the characters but in its legacy. The innocence of Luke Skywalker as he leaves his farm boy life to pursue his destiny. The innocence of the children and millions of fans who love this movie to their death. That to me is what Star Wars is all about.",10,1,3,23 May 2005
Fantastic Four," Disappointing...to say the least
","I have to say I had high expectations of this movie coming into it, probably because I hadn't read any reviews of it yet. After leaving the theater, I had that empty feeling, much like the one you get after you eat Chinese food. I was full for a minute, but 20 minutes later I was hungry again. This movie left me hungry, and not for a sequel, I was hungry for more content and more substance to the actual film. It was basically a movie about really cool superpowers and what the 4 of them do with it. There was almost no attempt to make us love the characters or understand how they really really dealt with these new amazing powers. The movie was way to short and basically had the feel of something in the making for over ten years that had dozens of scripts changes and in the end was finally put into theaters just to get it out there.",5,1,3,10 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best sequel ever!
","'Star Wars' broke all the rules for cinema and provided the entire world with a new way of making and watching movies. It also left everyone wondering, how are they going to top that? With 'The Empire Strikes Back', George Lucas delivered one, and arguably the most successful sequel of all time. 'Star Wars' was, with the exception of 'Jaws', the first real blockbuster film, and Empire was without question the first blockbuster sequel.This film took all the storyline elements of the first film and took it to an entire new level. It took the special effects in the first movie and advanced them even further, with the help of a much bigger film budget this time.We all know what happens, Luke trains to be a Jedi, finds out his father is Darth Vader, and nearly falls to his death while trying to escape the Dark Lord. Leia and Han fall in love, and Han is put into carbonite at the hands of Vader and Boba Fett, with a little reluctant help from his buddy Lando Calrissean. The character of Lando was in interesting and often overlooked element of this film. When we first meet him we think he is Han's friend and Billy Dee Williams does a great job of concealing his intentions before handing him over to the Empire. Of course Lando was in a bad spot, if Darth Vader told you to do something, would you say no? Most people contend that this is the best 'Star Wars' film, its debatable. The original is always going to be the first one that comes to people's minds when thinking of the whole series. However, if Empire is number 2, its a close number 2. The deepness of the story in Episode V goes beyond what was introduced in Episode IV, which is the reason many claim it is the better of the two films, and the best of all 6 films.Nevertheless, Empire ranks right up there with some of the greatest blockbuster films ever, and its hard to argue it is the greatest sequel ever made.",10,0,1,23 May 2005
Sin City," Rodriguez does it again
","Throughout his Career Robert Rodriguez has done things his way. Making movies he wanted to make and extending the boundaries of filmaking in the 21st century. It started with El Mariachi and continues now with the cinematic achievement Sin City. This movie is unlike any other movie that has ever been released by any major studio. This is not your run of the mill comic book movie where the actors seem out of place and the scenery is overdone. Sin City is a comic book movie, and it is what comic book movies should be. Everything about it, from the amazing cinematography to the cleverly acted roles by Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Roasrio Dawson, fit perfectly into every single aspect of this film. Whats great about it, is that every story has an ending, there are no loose ends left on any of the films 3 story lines. Despite that, there can be a sequel because there are so many Frank Miller stories to pull from. If there is a sequel then I am looking forward to it.",9,0,3,4 April 2005
