The Avengers," A pure instant classic and as epic as it deserves to be.
","I'm glad to see the response to Marvel's The Avengers (Damn that Uma Thurman movie for making me have to print the full title) has been VERY VERY positive. If there was ever a case for expectations being unreasonable then this was it. Also, we always get some anal fans that are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Either Avengers stayed very close to its root origins or people are judging it as the fine film it turned out to be. It's both to be honest and it seems most enjoyed it as much as I did. Anyone worried that Joss Whedon would make something this epic look like TV work needs worry no more. Visually it is a sight to behold and as epic as it deserves to be. I don't remember when I enjoyed a film THIS much and I really loved a lot of 2011's offerings. This movie just hits the highest level possible for me. It works on all of its own terms, there's no weighted enjoyment or cinematic slumming involved in enjoying it. It really IS a smart action film and the cast really delivered as expected. With this exceptional cast involved, how could it not? Whedon knew who his aces were and how to play them. Downey and Jackson are CLASSIC. That's not to say every major character didn't shine at one point it's just that when the beats mattered, the big guns when front and center. I also LOVED what Whedon did with Loki and how much of a home run Tom Hiddleston hit. Avengers truly a remarkable movie treat and I'm glad to see that the majority of film fans agree with me. The movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. Best of all, you leave the theater smiling and completely wanting more.",Null,2,6,11 May 2012
Fury," This movie is the definition of dour stupidity. Awful in every way.
","Black Friday Blu-Ray hunting led me to buy this movie. I had never seen it before and usually only buy things that I know are good. A great reminder to at least do your homework before buying anything, even at Black Friday prices.As I read another review here, 'Insulting to both Americans and Germans' to say the least. This movie is the definition of dour stupidity. It's poorly written and is awfully paced. There are some good, strife-filled performances but certainly a film no one would ever want to watch more than once. It's sole purpose seems to try and link modern fatalistic anti- war sentiments with the past. Thus, it's main goal is to tarnish 'the greatest generation' or reduce it to millennial BS perceptions. Everything about this movie reeks of a one dimensional tone and one long sour note.",Null,7,11,4 December 2016
Captain Marvel," As bad as feared if you are being honest. 2/10
","I'm shocked to say Captain Marvel is Marvel Studios Green Lantern movie. In fact, I honestly think Green Lantern may be better. Think about that for a minute. As bad as Green Lantern was, at least the lead actor was somewhat likeable. In Captain Marvel, Brie Larson is as bad and as uncharismatic as we all feared. Both films revolve around asinine plot turns and badly written characters. More is the pity for Captain Marvel since it sits directly in the MCU and what has come before has been so great.Everything was ham-fisted and poorly handled with no story arcs at all. Meaning everything is actually flat lined. She is the exact same character on the inside first act through third act. Seriously.What they did for her powers may have seemed like a brilliant idea but all it does is water down what has come before and reeks of desperation to tie this new character to better heroes. Once fully powered, her power levels are so inconsistent. Even before, nothing matched and everything felt off.As disappointing as the lead is, the supporting cast was worse. Nick Fury shows flashes of cool but was in fact a simpleton played for humor. Phil Coulson is barely in the movie. THAT is a genuine let down. Also, the less said about the cat the better. All jokes go through the cat. If you thought the humor in Thor: The Dark World was fit in to the wrong places at the wrong time then this will be even worse for you.Overall, lame attempt at world building, lame lead and extremely average action. Captain Marvel is indeed the absolute bottom of the MCU barrel",Null,475,1019,7 March 2019
Iron Man 2," EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more!
","The makers of this film held nothing back. When it works, as it does here, it rekindles even a cynic's movie love. So kudos to Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, Scar-Jo, Rockwell, Rourke and especially Favreau. What a film! It is a sight to behold. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on armor action or the charismatic 'down time' delivered by the best cast possible. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about? It's good to see the response to the movie has been, for the most part, positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. (X-Men and Wolverine fans I'm looking right at you!) Iron Man 2 stayed close enough to its roots and I hope most judge it as a film first. If you do, I'm almost certain that everyone will enjoy it as much as I did. It easily fulfilled and then exceeded all of my expectations. The only thing I worry about is that they may be setting expectations for that Avengers movie too high. How can it possibly live up to the standard these movies are setting and setting up????? Iron Man 2 is EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more! It is a special treat when a sequel reaches up and delivers an excellent film that you thoroughly enjoy as much if not more than a beloved first installment. It truly feels like they just paused and kept telling the same story but with more of an edge. Hopefully, they can do it again and skip that third movie curse. Think of it as another installment and they'll be fine. Fitting Avengers in to the mix is even more fun to think about but I heard that Favreau will be involved with that as an executive producer. So, I'm not worried. In the meanwhile, we can all enjoy this film because it stands on its own but as a great part of a running saga.",Null,36,74,27 April 2010
Aquaman," Some Fun But Mostly Bad Cheese
","There's no question that they really needed to cut at least 40 minutes out of this CGI monster. At times it was way more fun then I was expecting but at a point every new video game type crescendo started to all look the same. The CGI chaos actually became boring.The plot is nonsensical and the cheesy dialogue was dialed up way past high. By the time the main bad guy declares himself 'The Ocean Master' in full over-the-top B-movie mode I reached my cheese limit. Aquaman's power base also seemed all over the map in silly eye rolling ways. One minute he's super-farting a submarine and lifting it out of the water and the next he has trouble lifting his own body weight.What elevates this movie above the other atrocious DCEU movies that have come before are the visuals, the cast and some of the action beats. The whole Aquaman vs Black Manta scene was a joy to watch. Yes, Black Manta has the silliest and forced inclusion in the movie but it paid off in that brawl.The entire cast was really good. Mamoa gets the praise but Amber Heard was amazing and perfectly cast. The one edge I can give WB/DC over what Marvel has done is their casting of female leads. As with Wonder Woman, they allow their talent to be complete and captivating. That means strength of character but also not afraid to show female skin or deny that their heroes can be feminine as well as tough. Well played and I hope it continues and hope that Marvel learns from them in that regard.Overall, more fun than I was expecting and if they limit all the over-used CGI cheese I would want to see more of these characters.",Null,0,1,3 January 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," I don't remember when I enjoyed a film this much
","One of the year's best. It's a complete movie that flows so very well. Unlike similar films that are geared mostly to kids, this one has something for the grown ups. The way you're drawn to the main character as he grows from a a bullied kid with problems to an intense true hero is remarkable. As a viewer, you are constantly vacillating between intense sequences and fun moments. Needless to say, there's nothing to dislike about this movie. In every respect, it's a better film then any other effort of 2011, so far.This film works on all of its own terms, there's no cinematic slumming involved in enjoying it. I thought it was smart and the cast really delivered as expected. With this exceptional cast involved, how could it not? It truly is the best movie produced this year to date and I'm glad to see that the majority of film fans agree with me. The movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. Best of all, you leave the theater smiling.",Null,9,18,30 July 2011
Bridge of Spies," negotiations, posturing and dialogue done very well
","It's more than clear that Spielberg still has something left in the tank. This movie is masterfully crafted and given the subject matter, a master's touch was very much needed. The middle of the film does feel long and bloated but the set up and especially the third act negate that drag. Every scene that takes places in West Berlin and East Berlin and what follows was enthralling and a delight to watch. The entire film is basically negotiations, posturing and dialogue. So, showing both sides of the Cold War to a degree was an excellent decision. Tom Hanks was good as you would expect and the entire cast was serviceable. It's all about story in this case.Overall, an enjoyable 'turn your brain on' and enjoy type film.",Null,1,3,29 October 2015
Dunkirk," Bad movie that is emotional-less, heartless and stale.
","Dunkirk is a glorified History Chanel documentary. The movie is emotional- less, heartless and stale. Anyone saying otherwise is a Nolan slappie that would rave about him filming dogs pooping in a yard.The movie starts and throws you right in to dreary action. From there the entire run time is spent in jarring fashion that's meant to simulate being in an actual battle or being attacked. What it fails to do is be an actual film or tell any kind of tale. It's a two hour long dragout scene and not an actual movie. There is no real act structure so you can't even call the third act a failure.This thing shouldn't even be labeled a movie, just a two hour visual experiment on par with a Transformers level 'story' or VR experimental cinema.",Null,24,44,19 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," ***** Let's hear it for Captain America! The Best Movie of 2016 *****
","This movie stands above any other comic book film because it combines all the elements that make a film great. It's smart, well written, shot flawlessly with the best action imaginable, has superb performances, top notch effects and plot twists and turns that keep a viewer guessing and on the edge of the seat.From great character definition to well orchestrated action to funny lines to moving emotional scenes to true conspiracy and thrills to the powerful structure of the film, this is one superbly written film.THE best movie of the year because it remembers what the cinema is for... SMART ENTERTAINMENT. It never wants to insult intelligence like other big budget movies usually do (and some have already done so this very year). Civil War is smart but fun and thrilling. THAT is what the cinema is for and to quote the first film 'Let's hear it for Captain America!'",Null,9,20,3 May 2016
Django Unchained," one dimensional and unpleasant... terribly overrated
","I have to say that it's the love people brought for the creative talent in to this film that has won the day...not the film itself. People have passion and apparently blinders on for Quentin Tarantino, Leonardo Dicaprio, Jamie Foxx, and Christoph Waltz working together. It is the ONLY reason this tedious and poorly crafted movie is rated high at any site. It's blind love and certainly not justified in this case because the movie itself is terrible and one dimensional. I've read proper reviews that call Django Unchained a most unpleasant experience on par with the mindless horror films others rightfully dismiss. That fits and it certainly doesn't quality as entertaining or high quality. I have no problem with violence or the subject matter. I have a problem with bad writing and poor pace.Anyone rating this higher than a 6/10 really has the blinders on.",Null,5,7,31 January 2013
Thor," Dramatic yet FUN, Very Well Done!
","Thor works on so many levels. It meets its toughest challenge and that is to make its super powerful blond godlike lead character relatable and spark a connection to the audience. For all the action extravagance and adventure, a surprising and pleasant amount of time is devoted to character establishment and development. This certainly isn't some wild video game popcorn flick. It also packs the perfect amount of comedy, with most of the jokes at Thor's expense. Cutting a god down to size, is important for two reasons. One, the story itself is about Thor learning humility and two, it makes the character more believable and more relatable. It's what Marvel does best, give us heroes with flaws.A lot of this film takes place in the modern era on contemporary Earth and that was absolutely the right way to present the film. That's not to say that there aren't fantastical element, Asgard is breathtaking and incredible. Still, they manage to be dramatic and serious most of the time but balance it with a sense of humor. Thor finds the right mix similar to the way Iron Man did back in 2008. The film never becomes too self-important or portentous but still is dramatic and fun. The most fun outside of the incredible action sequences is when the consequences of the culture clash is played up. That is something to savor and enjoy. The fish-out-of-water angle is played up perfectly. They take a 'hero' or wannabe hero who is arrogant by temperament and used to having his own way and place him in a position where he has to grow. All the while using comic friction as a great tool to advance the plot and the development. Thor tries to continue to live his own reality because in his mind, he's still prince of Asgard. It's both fun and interesting to watch him come to grips with his situation. As he is humbled and out of place, audiences enjoy recognizing his human traits. Sure, viewers are thrilled by his powers, but we relate to his emotions and his flaws. Add some intense sibling rivalry, great action and romantic entanglements and Thor may just be the best movie of the summer.",Null,1,4,6 May 2011
Thor: The Dark World," Great fun, great film.
","Thor The Dark World was everything I was hoping for and quality entertainment from opening scene to the last. The director presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend of action and humor and yet it still remembers to pack a heart. The pacing was perfect even though I would've liked to have seen more quality time spent between Jane and Thor. That would've added more credibility to the chemistry and longing they both display for each other. Besides a few minor shortcuts in story, this film packs quite a punch and is every bit as good as I hoped it would be.Just like Iron Man, they played both sides of the fence perfectly. You need know nothing about the character to enjoy the film yet the fans were respected and spotted the little things that service the story but don't really register to non-fans. There are heavy ties to the events of Avengers but since everyone saw Avengers, that's a good thing.I think this sequel is very well written and proves the character and the mythos have layers to explore. They can't jam everything from the past forty years in to one film but they delivered enough smarts to go along with the spectacle to be sure.",Null,5,11,10 November 2013
Sin City," AWFUL, Save your money ... violent stylized stupidity
","I can't remember when I left a theater more disappointed then I did when I was walking to my car after Sin City. I knew nothing going in about the story or the graphic novel but I knew Frank Miller's work. His crafting of both Daredevil and Batman is legendary. All I could think of as I waited for this movie to end (which I NEVER thought it actually would) was that either Frank Miller went insane after he left Marvel or else the comics code held that insanity in check.This movie isn't creative or artsy, it's just flat out bizarre. I can see why Tarentino wanted to be involved with this stupidity. Two words spring to mind when thinking of Sin City  stylized stupidity. OK, maybe three words violent stylized stupidity. This movie is only about testing the audience's tolerance for violence as EVERY actor takes an over-the-top approach to EVERY shallow character. It's nothing more then an ultra-violent cartoon pretending to be something more. How many 'tough guy' characters can we follow around killing in spurts of blood? I enjoyed the early sexuality of the film but by the fifteen minute mark it disappears and all that's left is cartoonishly twist crap.The trailers and the TV commercials have showed EVERY frame of Jessica Alba's alleged striptease. Hard as it is to believe, there's NOTHING sexy about her character. The only redeeming factor about this waste of time was the extended nude scene of Carla Gugino who played Karen Sisco on the short lived TV show (I may have to check out Spy Kids 3 now!). Other then those two minutes, this movie was flat out awful.If this illogical and cartoony thing is any reflection of the twisted things going on in Frank Miller's mind, then I'm glad he's out of the mainstream. Save your money.",Null,11,25,1 April 2005
Coach Carter," a plodding, pretentious, and ultimately preposterous rip-off of Hoosiers
","As so often happens at films like these, my thoughts turn towards logging a film in the 'worst movie of the year' category. It is during the excruciating ineptitude that I think ahead to that happy time, less than a year from now, that this film will get what it deserves with an entry on most people's 'worst of' list. Unless, of course, a crop of even more fetid films crawls out from under a rock between now and then. For all our Coach Carter is plenty bad enough to tide us all over until next year. And maybe the year after. It wasn't aggressively horrible, but it was bad. It's just a plodding, pretentious, and ultimately preposterous rip-off of Hoosiers.",Null,14,30,15 January 2005
