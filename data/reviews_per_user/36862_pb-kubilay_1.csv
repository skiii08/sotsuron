Iron Man 3," awesome!
","It can be the most gripping film I've ever seen. You can't get your eyes away from the movie. Acting and special effects are amazing. I am a big fan of Robert Downey Jr who had also starred in Sherlock Holmes. I also watched Iron Man and Iron Man 2. I was waiting for this movie. Some people think it is awful but I can recommend it to everybody. It is a spectacular film because it's not dull, slow and predictable. So, I suggest you to watch it. I might love this film because of the love I have towards Robert Downey Jr. The man is funny. When I watched Sherlock Holmes, I was impressed immediately too. Let's all get ready for a great film! Everybody should see Iron Man 3!",10,11,24,1 May 2013
