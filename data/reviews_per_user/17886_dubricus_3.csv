Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," An avid Sherlockian LIKES it
","I think I've collected every radio, every film version of Holmes that there is... Wotner, Ronald Howard, even Stewart Granger's TV movie.I have to admit I was less than satisfied with the first film. I found Downey's performance somewhat off-putting for the same reason that I found Jeremy Brett's earlier episodes a little challenging - too frenetic. I also found the style difficult. It took getting accustomed to the flashbacks and the 'thought' segments... and rapid-fire video work.The first film also had an implausible ending. However, this film, despite some faux-pas and inconsistencies, which I feel were done knowingly... to serve a film that was sort of 'in-it-for-the-fun' rather than sticking to the canon or to history. It's good melodrama... in the way that the extreme Victorian stage melodramas could be so over-the-top as to be actually good fun.Therefore, I can overlook things that were ahead of 1891. I must admit that the look of the period was right on. The ladies dresses were spot on for ca 1890, rather than a more 1900 look, which is a very easy error.I'm also willing to allow Downey the deviation from Canon. Watson wrote in the Canon that Holmes was fastidious in his appearance, and cat-like.... tho' Holmes was not neat otherwise. Downey plays him consistently Bohemian. There is leeway... Doyle never really allowed us to see that 'other' side of Holmes' life... that mysterious world of opium dens, Bow Street Runners, going undercover, disguises, boxing, fencing, etc. It is this secret side to Holmes' life that recent versions have made hay from.What I actually really liked about this one was the foreshadowing of WW1... the munitions firms, anarchists, revolutionaries, sabre rattling. All of that was happening in the 1890s, but Queen Victoria and then Edward VII, kept the lid on by the fact that they were the senior members of a vast European Royal Family. The war waited until 4 years after Edward's death in 1910.Moriarity's machinations were in keeping with the Canon.... and with real rumors that were circulating at the time... that the munitions barons, etc were exacerbating problems and, in fact, promoting war.I find it an interesting pairing that 'War Horse' was released at the same time... Despite their extreme differences... I would strongly urge people to see both films... within days of each other.Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows lays a not too unreal groundwork, while War Horse will show the absolute futility of it all... the decimating of a generation of young men.... For what? All that WW1 really did was sell armaments and munitions.. and lay the groundwork for WW2, which laid the groundwork for the EuroZone... and today's problems.The linkages in Sherlock's extreme melodramatic fiction to the realistic War Horse... to our present problems is somewhat intriguing.",9,0,1,20 December 2011
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A wasted opportunity
","1. The film has a good, quite authentic look to it - at least as far as props, costumes, sets, etc. The sound of the old, wood-frame houses was right on. The landscapes are obviously not where they are supposed to be, but that follows an old tradition in Westerns. Canadian locations have become very identifiable & are obviously not Missouri nor any adjoining states.2. Brad Pitt made a good Jesse James. I know Jesse's photos quite well & was able to forget them. Mr. Pitt did his best to be enigmatic - I don't know if that was intentional in his portrayal of Jesse or simply because he didn't know how else he could carry on through this script.3. The rest of the cast did as well as they could. Sam Shepherd seemed a bit old for Frank James, but then I always thought that Frank looked old for his age in the few photos that exist.4. Now for the bad part - it is as slow moving as molasses in winter.5. Almost every film that has extensive voice-over explanations has had post-production problems. When it's all been put together, they've found that the explanations are needed, because the film had become a muddle.Having been a professional genealogist who has researched Jesse Woodson James & family & who has worked with celebrities, I understand what they were trying to do with this. In an oblique way they were using Bob Ford as 'stalker' ... as well as exploring Jesse's emotional-mental issues (which included drug use) & the various family connections that that are often neglected. It is rare that any film for popular consumption has mentioned the murder of Jesse's favorite cousin, Woodson Hite, by the Fords. It also often goes unmentioned that there was a lot of blood relationship amongst these various outlaw clans. Therefore, there were family issues, as well as the historical background that is more commonly known.I commend them for the attempt, but such an exploration was perhaps better left to print. Despite knowing most of the story already, I found it almost impossible to follow. Perhaps, the problem was that it simply could not retain my interest enough to follow it. Sometimes, a work that is very literary, with lots of explanation & internal action, but little real physical action, can be impossible to transpose to film. I suspect that is what happened.I really wanted to like this film, but sad to say, I didn't. Perhaps one day a mini-series will do justice to the complexity of these people & their era & will still manage to be entertaining.",1,27,53,3 October 2010
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Golf is not an easy sport to make into an exciting film.
","My father was a life member of the PGA. He joined in 1931, so he was in the group of golfers that followed Francis Ouimet & Harry Vardon. I grew up with golf & found the film to be quite good, but I suspect it takes a golfer or one who knows the game to not be bored. It's not an easy sport to make exciting. However, if one has ever been present at a tournament which is match play, you know that the suspense & tension is such that you can cut it with a knife.My main issue with the film is that, while it spent quite a lot of time dealing with Francis Ouimet's social inferiority in 1913 society, it didn't fully tell the story. Today top professional sportsmen & athletes are superstar celebrities, wealthy, & the elite of society. Back then it was far different. Francis Ouimet was poor & had caddied as a child. He competed as an amateur, but an amateur was supposed to be a gentleman & a person of wealth & position.... elite. Ouimet had to step into this elite society.... but at least he could... as an amateur. Professional sportsmen were considered & treated as mere 'tradesmen,' because they played for cash prizes. We get a couple of scenes that show the social tension, but unless a viewer is already aware of the situation, it's not fully explained. We see Harry Vardon idolized by the galleries & theatre goers, but viewers who are unaware of the situation are left to wonder at the snide, rude remarks made towards & about Vardon by the so-called 'gentlemen.' Professional golfers, like Harry Vardon, were not allowed in the club houses nor the use of any of the club facilities. They had to change clothes in the caddy shack or in their cars & if they ate, it was in the caddy shack with the caddies. These class striations persisted until after WW2 when Ben Hogan refused to play in tournaments unless the pros had equal access to club houses... the dining rooms, locker rooms, showers, etc... as the amateur players. It would not have taken much to clarify this situation, but as it was, I suspect that the film left many viewers confused.",8,0,1,30 July 2015
