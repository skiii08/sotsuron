Black Swan," Kindergarten filmmaking
","Mix horror, thriller, childish 'boo!' effect, lots of corny camera movements, simmer it with over-dramatic music and lighting, the result is an art fraud that'll fool audience and critics alike. That's Black Swan for you. First of all, what acting? Portman has only one facial expression which was magnified by the endless, tiring, and meaningless close-ups. 10 minutes into the film one is already sick of her shifty eyes and short breaths. Then there's the very shallow plot and lousy dialogue. There's no character development. The few talking parts are inconsistent and one-dimensional. Most people are mere blurry passing shadows. The crucial night out was totally incoherent. Things happen for no particular reason. The girl still shows no sign of desperation or desire. And it's supposed to lead to her 'letting it out' and 'living a little' by having red eyes and imagined feathers? wtf?And the lack of continuity! You'd think someone flipped the negatives. So bad I was hoping it's deliberate; an effort to display the mirroring yet twisted hallucination. But it's too subtle - one thing this film is anything but! The dichotomy of the white and black swans is symbolized literally (and solely!) by the white and black outfits. It's unforgivably lazy to convey a person's inner transformation by simply pulling a black singlet over a white one, and later covering all with a gray sweater - this is the filmmaking for the kindergarten! Finally, this is perhaps the only film about an art form that doesn't portray any of the beauty and passion of that art. Ballet is brutally and shamefully dismissed. It's reduced down to no more than the wooden doll spinning on the toes. Such annihilation is a blasphemy. Why does the filmmaker pick a topic he has absolutely no interest in? Instead of the power of ballet itself the film opts for the CGI effect which adds neither visual pleasure nor emotional value. wtf?Someone needs to wake up to the fact that female masturbation and lesbian sex don't make a film avant-garde. What happened to good scripts? Can nobody learn anything from the masterpiece 'The Piano Teacher'? Yet 'Black Swan' receives such undeserved rave reviews...... wtf?",1,71,131,31 January 2011
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great fun!
","You all have heard about its eye-popping, thrilling, entertaining, and electrifying actions and adventures, and yes, they are all true. On top of all that, this has got to be one of the most carefully choreographed action films. Each scene - the composition, the body language, the movements (including camera), etc â€“ is an exquisite design in impeccable coordination with the music score. When characters make eye contact you can literally see how their sight travels across the screen. If you plan to see this film again (like I do), watch how the visual is in perfect harmony with the sound. It's seriously a stunning musical in disguise.One extra star for casting Cumberbatch. He out-performed Quinto.",8,2,5,30 May 2013
The Hurt Locker," It's a worry!
","Yet another one-sided, simple-minded, righteous, and racist American's definition of 'war'. The locals are portrayed as uncommunicative, ignorant, cunning, cowardice, pitiful, barbaric, and slightly scary if you find yourself alone in their community. Other times just keep pointing the guns and shouting then maybe they'll suddenly get English.Undeniably the topic (the job) is interesting, but I fail to find the viewpoint and focus. There are very classic moments - like the first time we see our hero on duty, and like the desert scene. But there are also extremely dull and forced moments. The tension becomes a boring routine and by the last quarter of the film whoever dies will not surprise me at all. All characters are stereotypical - you see them in almost every war film. Even the little unnaturally conducted relationship with the local boy is stereotypical. The few confrontations and the last soul-to-soul chat make everyone uncomfortable, including the camera.If this was not the film that just won the best motion picture, I probably would've been kinder. But a best film should possess better quality in script, in character development, in story, in acting, AND in continuity (it's a shocker!). Unfortunately this is a long film about 3 not-so-interesting people.I wouldn't call this a war film. The only war is a guy fighting against his own passion for work. This film is not trying to say (and criticize) that this guy is just a piece of war machine not unlike the suicide bombers. No. It's saying that if that's the only thing you love (your own son included), then go for it and be a hero. And this film won so many awards, it's real a worry.Finally, what's with the taxi driver?",2,6,12,21 March 2010
Inception," A very sad case of Matrix-wannabe
","Everyone knows no matter how absurd it is, a dream is as real as (sometimes more so than) reality. Instead of taking advantage of this (lack of creativity? too scared?), the film confines itself to mirroring reality in every way - be it time, space, surroundings, physicality, ideas, or behaviours. Under the incoherent, made-up-as-we-go logic, the film is but a low-grade action film in a sci-fi disguise. The story line is laughably childish, the music is over dramatic and there's zero character development. It's a shame to see Ellen Page and Michael Caine's talent abused in this dribble. It's such a pity, really. In the right hand the same material could flourish and treat us to mind-blowing wonders and imaginations. Christopher Nolan has missed the point completely: dreams can be absolutely anything. Anything! We want to see rules bent and physics defied. But instead we were given the action sequence and plot from a 70s B movie. Entertainment-wise it's not that bad a film (admittedly there are far worse action films around), probably 2.5 stars if you leave your brain outside the theatre. But given the current unjustified high rating, I have to give it a super low one to tip the balance.",1,93,187,16 August 2010
RED," My son loved it!
","It's really not that bad for an action comedy that targets audiences of age 10. It's what I call a 'comfortable' film as you find yourself surrounded by familiar faces, characters, and story lines. You can sit back and enjoy it like you do with Bugs Bunny. There are exciting shootings and explosions (and importantly the heroes come up with blackened faces only). The funny moments in the trailer are still funny because it's the kind of joke that you forget as soon as it's over. One big major flaw is the romance between ancient Bruce Willis and a young girl - the concept is too disgusting for children. Really, where's the censorship.",5,1,3,18 June 2011
