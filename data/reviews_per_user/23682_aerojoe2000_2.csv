Scarface," 'Say hello to my little friend!'
","A fantastic movie. I do think that 'Say hello to my little friend.' is the only line without the F word in it. In my opinion, this movie is a work of art. The direction, the performances and cinematography is just outstanding. As long as you don't have a soft stomach and mot afraid to hear the F word about 300 times, you will love this movie.",Null,0,1,5 October 2003
Casino Royale," 'Do I look like I give a damn?'
","Certainly not! Daniel Craig jumps into the James Bond tux with aplomb, throwing skeptics and critics aside like an evil henchmen. There is no doubt that producer Broccoli's choice for the newest Bond was right on the mark. Craig captures the screen and never lets go with the truest representation of Fleming's Bond yet. You will even see that Bond has a soft spot and actually lets his humanity show more that enough times. Eva Green also shows brightly as Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelson grows on you to become one of the more sinister baddies of the Bond franchise. The story falls a bit toward the end before a shattering climax and a brief glimpse of a now polished and learned Bond at the ready for his next mission.Take a seat and hold on for the ride!",8,1,3,18 November 2006
