Requiem for a Dream," Burstyn Robbed of Oscar
",Incredible movie about the crippling spiral of addiction.  The movie remarkably captures the psychedelic warping of the mind and the hallucinagenic loss of control and it's tragic aftermath.Ellen Burstyn gives one of the most harrowing performances of any actor in many years....possibly ever.  To give Julia Roberts the Oscar over Ellen is sheer ridiculousness!!!,10,1,1,8 August 2002
