Saturday Night Fever," A beautiful film that captures the spirit of adolesence
","This film was Gene Siskel's personal favorite film for a very good reason. This film captures the spirit of youth, and uses the metaphor of the dance contest for the struggle of life. It is appealing on many levels, and effectively conveys the idea.",Null,0,0,4 June 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Brilliant and Effective Masterpiece by Kubrick
","A Clockwork Orange was Stanley Kubricks second greatest film, and is in my personal opinion the 7th greatest film ever made, one-upped by Citizen Kane, The Godfather, 2001, 8 1/2, Fargo, and La Dolce Vita. Its one of the few i have a copy of in my personal collection. It mixes images, sound, and emotion in a masterfull way that when combined with fanastic cinematography, editing, and direction, reveals a spectacular work. Worth seeing by any cinema lover.",10,0,0,15 June 1999
