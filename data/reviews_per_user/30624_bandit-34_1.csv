The Rock," A heart pounding, action packed adrenaline rush!!!!
","This movie is the KING of action movies!!!!! This movie has 3 of the best actors in the world, Connery, Harris but the real star of this show is Nicolas Cage. He has the best lines and the overall best performance. He would always crack a one liner in the most tense situations. Even though this movie may not be that believable, it still scores at the top on my list. Any Cage fan must see this movie. I give it ****1/2 out of *****",10,3,3,15 August 2000
