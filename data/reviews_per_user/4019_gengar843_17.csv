Source Code," Absorbing and Conservative
","I don't often see a modern film that I thoroughly enjoy, but this is one of the exceptions. From the start, you are immersed in the world of secret ops, a soldier subjected to experiments in the hopes of gaining some advantage over the enemy. However, this familiar theme changes abruptly. Rather than engaging the audience on a secret level (revealing a surprise only at the end), and rather than leaving prior information to itself, the screenwriter both elevates the level of consciousness and conscience as the movie goes forward. The viewer is expected to adapt to new situations almost as fast as the protagonist, and the ante is raised at every turn. Just when you think you understand what's going on, a new twist is added. The greatest of these is in the exploration of paradoxes. Many films, notably Back to the Future, have attempted to logically explain the space-time continuum, but none truly satisfactorily. This foray, I think, has done a superlative job. Even the deeper questions have plausible answers, according to the premises set. The ambiance is actually more like Groundhog Day, but the engineering is closer to The Matrix.As to the plot, it is riveting, and includes quite a few subplots which are handled with delicacy and efficiency. Everything from the romantic interest to the family background is explored (though some with more superficiality than others). The person with whom I went cried at one poignant moment, but not for the reason I believed! This film has depth.Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as a combat soldier (much better than a Ben Affleck), and he brings the correct mentality and fervor to the part. Sure, a bit over-the-top, but it suits the predicament(s). His co-stars are ancillary, but fit the blend.You will be warmed, shocked, and surrender to the outlandish ending. I hope when the DVD is released they include several alternate endings. Not that the theatre version is bad - not by any means - but I would like to imbibe in a few different avenues.As to the conservatism, I thoroughly enjoyed the respect given to the American soldier, even as the military-industrial complex is exposed (yet again).A few more twists delighted me, particularly the equal time given to a black genius seeking to exploit the naive white patriot (in typical casting, you might expect someone like Mos Def to be the hero and Anthony Hopkins to be the villain).All in all, different and worth several viewings.",10,4,7,15 April 2011
Shaun of the Dead," A Fair if Late Review
","The main plot is that 'Enders' get embroiled in apocalyptic London. The soap opera points are played for laughs, as is most of the film.The soap opera itself is too underplayed to make a suitable impact, and therefore the pathos is mainly of comedic nature, which unfortunately does not engender sympathy for mostly unlikeable characters, except Simon Pegg's. Yes, even 'Ed' hasn't enough depth to bring him alive, and therefore his end is rather benign, heroics notwithstanding. The one poignant scene is the stepfather telling the stepson how much he is loved.As for the zombie portion of the film, there are a few gruesome scenes which will keep any hardcore fan nodding lethargically, but there are some real issues with continuity and/or the arrow of time. For example, in the bar, the windows are smashed out and the zombies are comin' in, but a few minutes later the windows are NOT smashed out and the zombies are back out again. A serious error. When the rifle is utilized, it is shot from longer range rather than point blank; but if Simon is brave enough to use a sticky wicket or other handy instrument (a running gag), why not get closer with the firearm? Curious.The star of the film is Simon Pegg, and he IS worth the price of admission. Cool under fire from some bad scriptwriting and various staging problems, he rises above to create a character worth watching. His comic timing has never been better, and in effect he drags UP the other actors, who otherwise would bore.The other star is the swift editing, which is a nod to Sam Raimi, as is the line 'Join us.' Speaking of lines, Night of the Living Dead gets at least one obvious smile-bringing reference.As a whole, the film is slightly ordinary, having a somewhat-tense waiting period at the start, with media clues in the background of daily life building to the inevitable, a hackneyed caught-in-the-structure sequence, and a catch-all ending, before the surprise one-off punchline. For sheer chutzpah, Return of the Living Dead did it better, and Evil Dead 2 is the king of absurdity while still maintaining complexity and chills. Shaun of the Dead has a place in the canon, but not as high as Dawn of the Dead or Zombieland, because this is, after all, Cheech and Chong Meets the Living Dead.",7,1,2,18 March 2015
Alien," I'm Lucky
","I saw 'Alien' at the theatre in 1979. At the time, I was on a horror/ sci-fi binge. From 1977-1980, I went to the movie house to see STAR WARS, STAR TREK: THE MOVIE, PHANTASM, JAWS, HALLOWEEN, THE LAST WAVE, CARRIE, SUSPIRIA, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and loads of other great and not-so-great films.I consider myself lucky to have seen films such as ALIEN when they were completely new and unknown. When this movie came out, it was a revelation. While STAR WARS gave us the technology that was so missing in earlier Sci-Fi, ALIEN was a gift of design, hearkening back to such efforts as FORBIDDEN PLANET and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. But more than that was the absolute deviltry behind it all. H.R. Giger's symmetrical ideas are the gross marriage of the human organism and the great machine. From the 'boneship' which sends out the Warning beacon, to the hydraulic embodiments of the Nostromo, to the Alien itself, Giger's vision is nothing less than disturbing. In contrast, Ash's milky android is merely a shock vehicle. The Alien is, to me, the incarnation of Satan: invincible, unstoppable, human in form but completely alien, malevolent but calculating. The Nostromo becomes Hell for the crew in the same way that THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE converted a 'haunted house' into a nightmare-world of sordidness. Another great revelation of ALIEN was Kane's demise. For the first-time viewer who has heard nothing (me in 1979), an eye-popping experience awaits.Imagine being in the audience of the local movie-house, among the first to ever witness this! Another enjoyable feature of the movie was Veronica Cartwright. In 1979, I was 17. When I was 10, 11, 12, 13, LOST IN SPACE had been one of my favorite TV shows in reruns, after school. Does anyone else remember how wonderful those days were? While the character Lambert was not much more than a nervous Nellie, she was to me riveting, as I watched Penny Robinson all grown up, chain-smoking and cussing. Let me comment on the plotline also. I usually find many plot holes in Sci-Fi films. When I saw DEEP IMPACT, for example, I found the plot so objectionable that I actually engaged in a physical altercation with my movie partner. LOL With ALIEN, there was little to quibble over. Sure, Parker should've used the flamethrower rather than attack the Alien by hand; yet I DO understand Parker's unwillingness to put Lambert at risk. Some of the plot vehicles were somewhat convenient, such as the space shuttle's velocity near the end; but that falls under the heading of 'possible' more than 'improbable.' I've seen this film probably a dozen or more times since the first, and it loses very little luster. Of course, I'm no longer surprised where the director intended, but the understated characterizations leave something to the imagination of repeated viewings (unlike the more conventional ALIENS) and Giger's panoply never fails to awe and disgust.",Null,0,1,16 May 2004
Doctor Strange," Visual Treats Ahead
","This film hates itself, and loves itself, much too much.Why hate? Stephen Strange of comics fame was arrogant but firm, not the childish whelp which is written for Benedict Cumberbatch, who amplifies the wiseass teen persona quite naturally, which is irritating, and I think the writers and director wanted that. There is an alienation in this version of DOCTOR STRANGE which says 'Love it or be cast out!' I feel as if Iam being coerced into a cult of Cumberbatch, but Doctor Strange should need no such coercion. There is so much here to attract and potentially inspire, and yet we are subjected to acerbic banter rather than philosophy, and emotional band-aids rather than life lessons. I've said elsewhere the animated 2007 offering did it better. Sorcerer Supreme here is arbitrarily female, bald, with English accent, and a cheater in ways of magic; the animated version respected not only the original Sorcerer Supreme but also every ethos of Shamballa, Shangri-La, and other Tibetan adventure stories. Stephen Strange here is quite sarcastic for a man on a mission, unlike Tyrone Power in the wonderful LOST HORIZON, and more so for being out of his scientific element and such a klutz as a sorcerer until his miraculous transformation, which, honestly, must all be credited to the Cloak of Levitation. I don't buy this Mordo either, but happily I liked this Wong. As for villains, only Dormammu was worthy, the dark-side 'Nazi-ish' Kaecilius really very feeble for all his expertise and stolen knowledge, as well as power from Dormammu. One more thing, did not like the generally-terrific Rachel McAdams in a wasted role full of snark and disbelief, an exaggerated version of Dana Scully. So in these fashions, I feel the film has a self-loathing, and perhaps a razor blade for the audience, giving us dregs of characters.Why love? The film dotes on its effects, from the casual walking through a magic doorway or membrane to the ultra-spectacular meeting with Dormammu. There is of course a necessity to overwhelm with these visual delights since the characters are basically paper-thin and the story so disjointed. There are inclinations of INCEPTION here on the FX, but I can honestly say DOCTOR STRANGE does it better in any case. The film is overlong at 1hr55 (counting credits and teasers) but there are enough different cinema tricks to keep you entertained. That's why I say the film loves itself too much - it could easily have done everything without losing any eye candy in about 1hr40. The Dormammu confrontation was pretty clever, with the time loop, although more exposition of how that is accomplished should've been forthcoming. Honestly, the comic books are MUCH better at information than are most Marvel movies, and I don't particularly enjoy having to suspend my disbelief when I know the answers are on page 14 of issue 37 or whatever.I was also happy that Mordo turns out to be evil, which is correct for the character, but the explanation here, that the Ancient One had broken a rule to save the universe, and Strange to save Earth, is just a bite too much for me to swallow. I really liked the animated version reasoning better - Mordo is just not a guy who accepts second fiddle.",7,1,1,27 May 2018
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Rankin-Bass
","... made The Hobbit in 1977 and Return of the King in 1980. Great songs, excellent dialogue and voice characterization, and memorable.LOTR from Peter Jackson was awesome, everything I'd hoped for. Elijah Wood kicked butt and everyone was on task. Great effects and scenery, super battle scenes (even if the siege looks directly from Army of Darkness). Characters have plenty to do, and we CARE!The first Hobbit from Jackson was a travesty. Rude dwarfs invited by a disjointed Gandalf plunder a pleasant Baggins abode, and this take an HOUR. By the end of the first film, I actually wanted half the dwarfs to die. Arrogant, not worthy of anything. The 'roller-coaster' rides were unending, and the fall through the Goblin kingdom was worse than a video game. Bilbo was cool, as was Gollum, and so I gave it B+.This Hobbit is better, but not by much. Smaug, as many have pointed out, is an idiot. He may have a fine speaking voice and a vocabulary, but he has ADHD issues, and it's not funny, and not TRYING to be funny! Sad. The dwarfs are even MORE ungrateful, and Thorin's turn for the Arkenstone is tired after knowing the Ring is of the same persuasion.I also found there to be many problems with logic. For example, if the eagles are willing, why bother with a land quest? Just take Eagle Airlines to Lonely Mountain.As well, I'm really tired of Orcs who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, and have no talent with weapons. Remind me again why we should be afraid of these pathetic creatures? Oh yeah, there's lots of 'em. Like cockroaches.Bilbo's innocent act also wears thin. He doesn't grow weary OR that much more courageous, as both Frodo and Samwise do in LOTR. Bilbo acts like it's just a ride at Disneyland.I'll stop now. I feel bad dumping on it like this.",6,1,1,14 April 2015
Mr. Nobody," Heart-Rending Tale of Regret and Isolation
","What if your true love never crossed your path because you made a different decision? In essence, this is the film. It is a study in paradoxes and time travel, also encompassing whether reality is real or imagination, and vice versa. Don't worrry, this review will not spoil it for you. There are no words to describe Nemo Nobody's adolescent love affair, which is so idyllic yet also typical, for the time it is permitted to thrive. There are also no words to describe the betrayal and loss Nemo experiences in the course of his interdimensional travels.The casting couldn't be better. Furthermore, there are no conflicts of interest between storytelling and moviemaking. The politics of today do not enter, no distractions from Left or Right, meaning you can relax and let the writing, acting, directing, and effects wash over you as pure cinema.In the 155 minute version I saw, some elements seemed extraneous, but not to excess, and therefore it retains a 10 score in my book.",10,0,0,4 May 2018
The Mist," From Lovecraft to Cloverfield
","EDITED REVIEW:Stephen King likes to pretend he doesn't believe in traditional religion but he obviously does. He just likes to rain on everyone's parade. Whether this is a personal cruelty or just a joke, it still comes off as crass and, frankly, forced.In THE MIST, a main character, Mrs. Carmody, a fundamentalist Christian living in Maine, of all places, preaches that what comes in the titular mist is vengeance from God. Stephen King makes it clear it certainly is. In fact, King is obviously angrier with misuse of technology than with misuse of the Bible. The end of Mrs. Carmody is savage in a way that appeases people who just want her to shut up, not really people who don't believe in God. What Mrs Carmody is saying is not truly out of the real of possibility, it's the way she says it. She's vulgar, curses a lot, and it seems obvious she is bipolar. This then is King's little joke, that you'd have to be literally mentally ill to be fervent. The next level down for King is fear. If you shiver for your life, you'll follow anyone. This many be true, but this is more a commentary on charismatic leaders than on religion. That Mrs. Carmody's message is at the right place and time to sway the shaken crowd isn't an indictment that she's looking for someone to lead, but rather that for the first time in her life her own faith seems to be showing itself. I don't see how anyone can fault Mrs. Carmody for that, but, like I said, she acts more like a demon than an angel, so it's not a great surprise that she gets hers.As for the character David Drayton, played by the great Thomas Jane, he is the antithesis of Mrs. Carmody. He begins with a sense of fairness, as when he helps his neighbor, Brent Norton, after the thunderstorm, and watches it dashed to pieces, as when Norton accuses Drayton of trying to make him look foolish rather than trying to save his life. Of course, the deepest fall for Drayton is at the end, when he commits the ultimate acts of faithlessness one minute too soon. We can talk about whether it was murder or assisted suicide, mercy or thoughtlessness, but there is no doubt that whatever faith in himself Drayton had disappears in that moment, and he now realizes he should've had faith in the Almighty to rescue him, even if not in Mrs. Carmody, who obviously was not going to save anyone. This brings up an interesting question: Did the people in the supermarket ultimately survive? If they did, was it not by the crazed and herself-murderous Mrs. Carmody that they did. Alas, we don't know. What we DO know is that the character played by Walking Dead alumnus Melissa McBride DID survive, and seemingly was rewarded for her own courage, if not faith. Speaking of Walking Dead, THE MIST is written/directed/produced by Frank Darabont, co-creator of that winning series, Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath on WD), and Laurie Holden (Andrea on WD), a veritable what-what!?.The beasts from THE MIST are Lovecraftian, and the premise is slight, that the military has released them into our dimension from another, through an unknown scientific process. THE MIST predates CLOVERFIELD by one year, but these monsters and their sounds seem awfully familiar. Is it possible the films take place in the same timeline universe? Watching them back-to-back, there is a feeling that CLOVERFIELD is a continuation, as perhaps beasts which escaped destruction in Maine, although CLOVERFIELD seems to indicate those might've come from another planet.The pace of this film is well-suited and there is little filler. The characters are briefly-delineated but sufficiently so. There is a feeling of anxiety but not rushed. The effects are well-done and the atmosphere is pretty great.9/10",9,6,18,22 November 2007
I Am Legend," Nope!
","You're gonna hate me. Oh yes you will.*SPOILERS AHEAD*Wil Smith: good actor, fine actor. This movie: hard to say. The script was not very good. I guess he did an adequate job with the material, as well as the physical part of his role. If anything, it looked like an exercise in 'see how well I can act.' I'll take Ali, Men in Black, Independence Day, thank you.Special Effects- Disaster: half-and-half. The cityscapes were well-done, evoking that ache which is desirable for this type of apocalyptic theme. However, details! Why are there lions roaming Manhattan? Did someone let out the zoo? And why are there 'herds' of deer. First place: deer don't congregate like that. Second place: where did they come from? Manhattan's sealed off, remember? A further bone of contention: the deer have *what* to do with the plot? Special Effects- Zombie/Vampires: terrible. 'The Last Man on Earth' (1964) did it right. The returned should be weak, feeble, and feeble-minded. It just makes sense. Also, why do all the creatures look alike? Are they albino? What's with the razor teeth? And how come they can howl like a banshee? Furthermore, the CGI hordes were just ridiculous, regardless of how much work that took. They can climb buildings like Spider-Man? And since when do NYC brownstones crumble like dust? Those buildings are built like tanks.Logic- As many have pointed out, what's the story with the lack of guns and ammo? How much sense does it make to have autos rigged with explosives right outside your house? Seriously, an electric fence makes much more sense. And how do all the lights in the area work? They shouldn't, since he needs a generator or three to keep his place going. On that, where are these generators?- it seems awful quiet in that house! And how did the vampires cut off power to all the lights at once? I could go on all day about logic.How did Anna's presence cause the vampires to disperse? Did she have halogen lights? So what if she did? How did she get Wil Smith to the car? They should have showed her strength. Who is Ethan? We get no background, and ultimately end up not caring about him. How can such a kid survive, one who doesn't know enough to keep his trap shut when a ceiling-hanging zombie is nearby? Oy.Here's another thought: the grenade at the end. What is it packing, a mini H-bomb? And if the blast is that powerful, shouldn't Anna and Ethan be trapped in the chimney? I want logic! So, a nice visual movie, with great sound, pleasing to the senses. But it makes very little sense.",6,3,3,5 April 2008
Amadeus," Scribbling and Bibbling
","I would like to make some short comments. 1. Acting - a. F. Murray Abraham - there wasn't much for him to do except brood. Flashes of intensity, but for the most part, he seems swept through the action by happenstance. b. Tom Hulce - over-the-top performance still made believable by the restraint of the script. Especially convincing is Mozart dictating to Salieri. c. Elizabeth Berridge - unconvincing, underplayed to a fault. Relying on script and costuming is a poor way to make a living as an actress. d. Jeffrey Jones - made an impact on me as a catalyst and not a flunky of the circumstances. Leopold's brief interactions are nonetheless very important to the storyline. 2. Writing - the plot line is pretty cool: a little bit of Hitchcock straining at the leash, but mainly we're treated to a chronology of Mozart's works, albeit truncated and jumpy. The subplots concerning Mozart's father and Wolfie's wife are thin, and to me don't add any substance to the transitions nor the ending. What stands out is the God-given talent of Mozart, which is brilliantly displayed in both the context and the acting. Hulce brings to life the torture of genius. What it feels like to be blessed by God, which can also be a curse. He has all the music in his head, and the rest is just 'scribbling and bibbling.' To say that Mozart worked himself to death wouldn't be outlandish, even knowing that his alcoholism contributed mightily. But which was the killer? Was it the strain of dealing with all the music that wanted to be released, or was it liver and/or kidney failure? The ambiguities here and in Salieri's story are riveting, if ultimately unsatisfying. One moral I came away with: be happy for what you DO have, for jealousy will drive you mad as surely as ambition will drive you into the earth. 3. Design - costuming was heroic, and the settings were impeccable. The extras were very believable, and the atmosphere reeked of baroque. A little more definition of Vienna was perhaps needed just to reel you in a little deeper, but I'm being trifling here. 4. Music - I'm not crazy for Mozart, but I walked away with a greater appreciation for the prodigy and his vocation. I've always looked on Wolfgang Amadeus, the composer, as very pompous in his assumptions concerning the listener, and this was pointed out in the film as well. Nevertheless, the pieces are short enough to placate my A.D.D. and yet long enough to satisfy my curiosity. 5. Objectionable Material - concerning sexual content, there is no nudity, but there is some adult speech. No violence.",8,3,6,16 March 2005
Super 8," Jurassic E.T.
","BOTTOM LINE FIRST: I liked it!
THE GOOD: 
Spielberg doesn't disappoint in production values. 
Abrams keeps his trademark POV action sequences. 
You may cry during the schmaltzy reunion scene. 
The logical advance of plot is mainly intact, though holes will naturally occur on a storyline this broad. 
The cast is pleasant, bringing to life distinct characters that will keep you caring (a VERY important point for me).
1979 setting is realistic enough, including haircuts, vehicles, and so forth, also 'breaking the fourth wall' for some Back To The Future memories (and yes, Noah Emmerich will remind you of Biff Tannen).
Some very good comedy relief.THE SORTA-BAD:
The monster is mostly typical, with the requisite heart of gold misshapen by his human military captors. On the plus side, the monster's situation reflects that of the main adolescent characters.
The action scenes, while thrilling, do jump the shark in terms of escape.
Quite a few unresolved or scantily-sketched subplots.It's a popcorn movie for sure, with a few deeper moments, but it's very well-done, so it gets a 9. You really can't go wrong.",9,0,2,6 May 2018
Groundhog Day," Awesome!
","SPOILERS One of my favorite films!  Just like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' Harold Ramis sets this quirky fantasy-romantic comedy in a small, snowy town.  Unlike Jimmy Stewart's character, however, Bill Murray's (one of my favorite actors of all time-- so, shoot me!) has virtually zero compassion factor at the start.  Through an unknown mechanism, our 'hero' is forced to relive Groundhog Day over and over until he 'gets it right,' that moral being in the hands of the filmmakers.  On the way from ruffian to sweetheart, Phil Connors gets his face slapped repeatedly, robs a bank, becomes a romantic scoundrel, commits various suicides, and generally runs rampant as he knows that tomorrow is NOT 'another day,' but the same day!  Great fun and loads of laughs, smirks, and 'cool!''s even after seeing more times that I can count.  When Phil finally starts to 'settle down' after 'sowing his oats,' the Capraesque elements start creeping in, until you are swimming in Americana, heroism, and sentimentality.  Granted, you have to like Bill Murray (which I do), and you have to enjoy the old-fashioned sensibilities that the movie wants to impart (and I do).  I give it 10/10. :-)",10,1,4,26 March 2004
Inception," Not All It's Cracked Up To Be
","Like Avatar, we have with Inception paper-thin characterizations with groundbreaking special effects. Interestingly, both films concern consciousness while dreaming.Avatar held us to the false-choice premise between good and evil, and carried out its mission by making the bad guys completely unlikeable, and cowardly in many respects, while at the same time creating a magical Lion King-like symmetry that scratched some primal desire to start all over again, preferably in a jungle setting among American Indian-type lifestyle. Nothing complicated, and the simplicity held until the end.Inception, on the other hand, asks us to believe that Cobb (DiCaprio) cannot find any other way to get back to America except through the sheerest of cliffhangers which involves putting all his compatriots at risk, of whom only the newest and most ignorant seems to care about her own safety, which is also sacrificed for some unknown reason, as we are held by the filmmakers to also sacrifice ourselves to Cobb's pathos rather than to the caper itself.This is the main weakness of the film: that Cobb couldn't simply buy his way home, through the various means of the rich, such as private jets and private airports, which do not undergo immigration checks as we, the lower classes, must endure. That Saito had access to such wealth and transportation only adds to the heavy sighing one must yawn while being kidnapped through this terrible screenplay.Meanwhile, the altruistic Saito also grates on my nerves, as we are to believe this ruthless businessman is also so very generous in his offers, brave in joining them, and important to save.The wisecracking Brit had to little to impart except as a foil to the urbane Arthur, and Arthur honestly did not add much more.Michael Caine in a thankless role, and Ariadne, who was puffed up from the start as the next level of architect, is no more than an impulsive wide-eyed ingénue who does more to move the plot with her interference in personal issues than in her skills.There is little chemistry between the characters, as we are never given the chance to learn about them, which is the more amazing since this film is 140 minutes! The use of Mombasa as a location was gratuitous, and Saito's ability to get Cobb out of a jam at the last minute completely jumped the shark.The interaction of Cobb and Mal is without very much depth or pity, and therefore I felt little for their love or loss. Mal's suicide was unnecessary, her psychiatric ploy not within the realms of how things work in reality, and even the mind trick which Cobb says he planted in Mal's head is confusing and ultimately stupid. In fact, Mal's inability to distinguish, and the ease with which she dropped away, causes me to revile her for the shallowness of her understanding. I am to believe that after 50 years alone in a world of their own making that Mal cannot know what Cobb did even after he confesses? It made her insane? I should care? The effects in the film are mind-boggling. That's all I can say. Cinematic high.I can't say this film rates an 8.8 or even an 8, but the effects at least take it from trite 6 (including the James Bond ripoff ski scene) to a passable 7.Enjoy!",7,2,5,27 March 2015
Iron Man," Duuuunn---duuun---da-da-daaahhh
","Yeah! This movie was flamboyantly ROCKIN'!! Robert Downey Jr's quickly-delivered one-liners were barbed with bite by marvelous Marvel scriptwriters, and Downey's delivery was as impeccable as his Malibu house.**SPOILER ALERT** The story begins crisply as Tony Stark's military escort in the Mideast sands is ambushed by terrorists. This scene is swift, and very realistic for this type of flick.Then, we get a major flashback which uploads tons of information on Tony Stark's character, career, and friendships. Here, we get big bang for the buck invested in this background.A mini-story then transpires, giving us a glorious new beginning for the man of iron, including a terrific technical segment long enough to linger, and short enough to keep our attention. Here, Tony also receives his motivations for the remainder of the movie.After a battle royale, and rescue (I don't want to give away too many details), Tony Stark continues constructing an updated version of the suit.Engaging enemies in foreign lands, and taking to the skies like a rousing rocket, Iron Man is born! Of course, Iron Man meets a formidable enemy, but it won't be who you think it is.Other great aspects to this movie are a generous portion of good-natured and true humour, a very believable Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, an unobtrusive Cuba Gooding Jr, great Lucasfilm robotics, and a cool music score.Now, some bad points: (1) Iron Man's major foe has two question marks which are not explained - namely, how can the foe exist if the technology is not backwards-compatible with Tony Stark's creation? and how can the foe be formidable without any experience with the technology? (2) Major explosions generally cause great damage, injury, and loss of life, yet the finale will have you scratching your head as to realism in these things.However, these negatives aside, 'Iron Man' was worth the price of admission.9/10",9,2,4,9 May 2008
Mother!," Self-Conscious Absurdity Without A Point
","God, a noted poet with writer's block, lives in a house with his 'wife' Jennifer Lawrence (gorgeous as usual), who is renovating it from a previous fire which destroyed everything, including God's previous wife. OK, first off, it's difficult to keep straight if Jennifer is supposed to be The Holy Spirit or Mary, mother of Jesus. Second, it's a pretty abstract cinematic device, so let's leave this alone for now. Third, I suppose the message is, God has done this before, which is not really Biblical and also quite disheartening.God invites a stranger (Ed Harris, let's call him Adam) to stay the night in the house (let's call it Eden). During the night, Adam loses a rib while in a vomiting fit. The next morning, the stranger's wife (Michelle Pfeiffer, let's call her Eve) shows up and begins vamping it up. Eventually, the two sons (let's call them Cain and Abel) arrive, and Cain slays Abel, receiving a mark on the head from God. OK, so we are now clear that God resides in Eden, and has begun the process of creating mankind. If you want a film to have a moral, there must be rules which are to be obeyed and consequences for not. In THIS film, God never establishes any rules but just lets everyone run amok. While you might be able to make an argument that's what happens in the Bible, there is still the little detail called 'don't eat from the tree.'After this, the movie picks up a little steam. God invites everyone into His house and they begin to destroy it, and each other, and to use God's name in vain for their own purposes (don't worry, radicalism was not omitted from the list of sins). I must say, these scene were quite Dante-esque, with a little Peckinpah for good measure. Jennifer tries to save the house, and her baby, but fails in both. First, the film again and again fails to recognize that God makes specific commandments for men to follow and they don't. Instead, God is depicted as extremely permissive, which is false. So the film blames God for not giving us instructions, which is as obnoxious as it is not true. Second, let's just say the cannibal scene is an interesting slap in the face to Christianity, specifically about 'eat my flesh and drink my blood' which is obviously not supposed to be taken literally, or else this film shows what! The film also puts the cart before the horse, claiming that God wants to forgive men for murder because, well, 'we have to.' The truth is, men were told not to murder, but they do anyway. Most reasonable people should think the film is subversive here, slapping both God and man, as if the writer is smarter than all. No, I don't take the film to be a representation of the Bible, but a knowing leer. If it's not, the filmmakers are quite ignorant of what the Bible says.FInally, after two hours of browbeating, the film mercifully ends by lending Jennifer the mise-en-scene as Christ off the cross, being carried. Confusingly, God takes her heart (her 'love') and begins the process all over again, making us feel small and unimportant. After all that God did and hoped for in the film, He basically wipes the slate clean, like an Etch-a-Sketch. There is no hope, no love, no process. It's all despair, despite the sunny bedroom ending.This is only 'art' in that the filmmakers obfuscated their ignorance and biases by exaggerating the action and characters to absurdity. It's really more of an avant-garde cartoon, only without any humor. In fact, the intensity of every moment is so self-conscious as to feel like the joke itself, mocking any piety. As I said, Jennifer Lawrence looks amazing here, and I will superficially give this a 6 rather than the 3 it deserves.",6,0,1,12 May 2018
Beowulf," A FANTASTIC Epic!
","Though the plot focuses on action, there is great tenderness for the Viking tradition (even if some say this is Anglo-Saxon), and it is not marred by needless updating. This alone makes a film worthy, especially these days. The lustiness and heroism of these great warriors is not muted by apologies, and one may enjoy this film as a standalone historical (or perhaps mythological) epic. In this vein, and for this genre, the film is meaty. Could it have done more? I think not, given that Lord of the Rings used a trilogy to squeeze out characterization and subplots. Beowulf on the other hand traverses at least two different stories in the two hours afforded.The characters are marvelous, if somewhat familiar. A perfect respite from the wise-cracking Thor of Marvel films. Ray Winstone is the epitome of Beowulf, Anthony Hopkins does a wonderful job as King Hrothgar, Brendan Gleeson is the great sidekick, and Angelina Jolie is ravishing as Grendel's mother. Like subplots, sub-characters, such as John Malkovich's Unferth, don't get enough time, which is good, because it means you wanted more. Even Grendel (Crispin Glover) is somewhat brief. Everything seems realistic and characters act like real people, not caricatures, which seems to be the norm lately. The dialogue matches expectations, even if there is more we'd like to know.The high point of the film is the extravagent NINE-MINUTE battle between Beowulf and the dragon, which in 3-D is dizzying. This is also an emotional battle, so there is extra energy to it. In CGI, there is so much more that can be done, and I like the balance director Robert Zemeckis struck between keeping it real and milking the fantasy with animation. The music is rousing and fitting. I enjoyed the overture and the theme song, but I am sucker for Enya and Celtic in general, as well as Scandinavian traditional.Like Alien and Independence Day, this is a film I could watch over and over. It over-delivers on its promises.",9,8,10,9 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Monument to Mediocrity
","From the virtue signaling of social justice, to the cheap-jack plot-line which was easily discerned in advance, to the awful acting which evoked little but hooting from me, I was, as you can see, disappointed, and in some cases outraged. If you dare to join me, I will explain.I have nothing against diversifying the Star Wars universe, which is why I LOVED Star Wars 1, with its Oriental villains, Jamaican Gungan, Jewish scrap dealer, and more. It was a delight of indulgence which fleshed out characters of charm, making the experience vivid and interesting. But after Lucas received flak for ethnic portrayal, Jar-Jar became boring in Star Wars 2. In Star Wars 7, this pandering becomes intolerable. It's fine that Leah has the force, and it's fine that Rey inherited it, but Finn is gratuitous in his race. I would have nothing against this either but they make Finn formidable with a light-sabre against Kylo Ren. And please don't soft-soap me that love gave Finn the strength and skill to take on a pupil of the force - only hate has that power, the dark side. Otherwise, one must be cool and focused. Given this, I dismiss Finn and therefore it irritated me to watch Kylo Ren sword-play with Finn and not simply crush his windpipe with a wave of his hand, or penetrate his mind, which seems to be Ren's forte. As for Kylo vs. Rey, a bit more believable, but it made Kylo seem almost inept. Really? Rey's raw ability with zero training is tougher than Kylo with training? Not even close to believable.What didn't I like about the plot? Well, first, aren't we simply replaying Death Star destruction from the first trilogy? Why, yes we are. And it looks like the Supreme Leader made all the same engineering, logistic, and tactical errors as the Emperor, just on a grander scale, including the convenient 'having to recharge the cannon' just long enough for the Resistance to 'win the day.' Yawn. Second, much of the plot was geared to exploit the Skywalker/Solo family tree, and there was no thrill to any of it. Darth Vader is Luke's father - WHOA! I jumped out of my seat. Han is Kylo's father? Zzzz. Even if you wanted to say this was a remake, which it's not, it doesn't have the pizazz, never mind the oomph, of the original. But what does? But the acting is where I think I really blew my cool. I can understand characters of convenience, and plot-lines of olde being rehashed, but it has to be acted well to pull it off. Even in Star Wars 3, as sappy as it was, the acting was GREAT, IMO. In Star Wars 7, Harrison Ford is just about limping to his finale, Carrie Fisher looks doddering and not commanding, Daisy Ridley grits her teeth so often I thought she was Red Sonja, John Boyega makes a concerted effort to appear naive at every turn (which makes his good fortune all the more unbearable), Adam Driver does not look torn in the least, and so forth.I can point to hundreds of interesting and thrilling moments from the first six episodes of Star Wars which makes a complete weekend binge-watch, over and over again. Star Wars 7 does not add to that excitement. The tech seems standard, the CGI a little too self-conscious, the nostalgic cheese forced, the push forward too bossy and not natural. Still, I give this film a 6 in the hopes that Star Wars 8 will push the envelope once again.",6,14,17,21 June 2016
Godzilla," Fair Vote for a Fair Movie
","Let's begin with my biography, which appears to be mandatory for rating any Godzilla movie. Love Godzilla. Now I have cred.(1) The opening buildup was fantastic, and the death scene of scientists trapped beneath the crumbling nuclear facility was crushing. So... why all of a sudden am I 15 years in the future when I have invested so much emotion into that little family from 1999? I now have to begin all over again getting to know new characters. Within 5 minutes I hate them. Young Ford was worthwhile, adult Ford is a chiseled dummy. His wife is so damn cute and that is a problem, because I know where this is leading, that she is the bestest in the whooooole world. And she is. And that is not the world we live in. And I am not willing to suspend disbelief and invest myself into that single-dimension female, just so I can be manipulated by her perfect nose! (2) Godzilla comes to our attention in this movie with too much fake mystery. There is a false sense of wonder about a creature we obviously know and love for 60 years. OK, the 'reveal' is important. But this one is not spectacular. This Godzilla is somewhere between a big fat oaf and a steroid-filled athlete, like Mark McGwire's forearms. He's formidable, don't get me wrong, just overstuffed.There is also an issue with Godzilla's origin, which seems far too fluffy, to the point where Hiroshima is but a sidebar. Let's face it, it's 2014, and today's audience does not have the same perspective on 1945 that audiences did in 1954, 1964, 1974, 1984, and so forth. More exposition was necessary.(3) As one reviewer pointed out, there are umpteen plot holes, stupid plot devices, inconsistencies, scientific protocol errors, film continuity misses, and so forth. Where does one begin? Let's take the bridge scene. Really? Firing towards monsters while the bridge is filled with military personnel and civilians? Really? A bus driver maniacally running down cops and soldiers without being shot at? Really? The bus is blocked by a giant piece of bridge which is magically gone the next shot? (4) These MUTO's are straight from Cloverfield, with a bit more characterization, mostly boring. Most Godzilla monsters are cool, these are sterile. The EMP-causing gimmick wore thin, was unbelievable, was badly carried out by the director of the film, and was circumvented by errors in continuity. My biggest issue was the egg-sac being dragged around on the female's rear end. In one scene, the egg-sac was displayed so that Ford could've simply shot it out and ended that menace. But I guess we needed to save the eggs for the 'suspenseful' sequence where Ford 'heroically' sets fire to the eggs with a 'convenient' gasoline source. Cut-rate Aliens.(5) I liked the Godzilla fight scenes but, honestly, they lacked depth. The 1990's Godzilla movies are famous for entire-city miniature sets being destroyed by rubber-suited Godzilla vs. cool nemesis. Those scenes rock, even though you can tell they're fake. This movie aspired to realism, in some degree, yet was ultimately stymied on how to improve on the rubber suit, even with CGI. It's a close call but I don't agree that this Godzilla was particularly amazing. He was fairly clumsy, pretty lucky, and not a good fighter. His laser breath was good, but, as with most Godzilla movies, why didn't he just use that breath earlier and end it? The CGI was, honestly, not THAT impressive, and Godzilla's roar was not authentic, nor particularly stimulating or scary, just typically hysterical for our age of imitation.(6) I think Ford's son was so much dead weight, almost a mental cripple. I don't think he said one word in the film, because even his 'mommy' was yelled off-camera. Maybe I'm wrong about that one detail but wow, I really hated that kid.Speaking of kids, what was the purpose of the separated Japanese child in the subway? To show Ford's bravery? And that grabbing scene is straight out of Aliens.(7) I've seen Prometheus several times, mostly because I like it as a train wreck of acting, plot, dialogue, and etc. This film is not even half as bad as Prometheus, and therefore must impress me otherwise. In that respect, I would watch this Godzilla because it's Godzilla, and for Elizabeth Olsen's pert nose. Maybe on TV it will translate better.Cloverfield and Pacific Rim were sold 8-9 in my book. This film is a 6, maybe even a 7 if you are very forgiving of senselessness and illogical situations.",6,1,2,20 May 2014
