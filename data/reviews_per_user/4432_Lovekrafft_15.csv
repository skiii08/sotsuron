The Lobster," Worth the watch
","The Lobster is one of those movies where metaphor and allegory fly under a rather straightforward script about relationships. But the plot is similar to 'The Anti-Christ' where setting and dialogue are sparse and forceful. A thinkers movie, for sure.The beautiful resort and surrounding forest is contrasted with horrific implications for the residents and I am sure everyone can identify on some level with characters from the movie. Reminds me of a cross between Grand Budapest Hotel and Melancholia.",Null,1,2,20 February 2017
Blade Runner 2049," An Immersive Experience
","I went in with very little knowledge of the plot, in order to get a fresh, unbiased viewing. Was I ever impressed!Great acting, set design, soundtrack. Stayed true to the source material while offering expanded worlds to explore. A subtlety to the emotion contrasts with the grim plot line, and these interactions fit perfectly in establishing and developing the plot. Further viewings will help fit the pieces together as to how the characters come together.Very little to criticize and the director deserves a great amount of praise for a sincere continuation of Ridley Scott's original masterpiece.Ryan Gosling was a perfect choice for the lead, Jared Leto also impressed, with relative newcomers Ana De Armas and Silvia Hoecks giving stunning performances.",Null,0,3,10 October 2017
Hereditary," Brilliantly disturbing
","Well-paced, with a buildup to a chilling conclusion. Small clues as to the final plan of the cult are thrown throughout and leave the viewer only partially able to grasp the scope of the plan. The viewer is also startled through the insertion of horror elements when least expected (for me, it was the cultists outside the home in the final act standing silently).I recently read Ramsay Campbell's 'The Parasite' and it has similar themes. Casting is superb. The music, locations (a vague, generic layout which implies that this plot could be anyone's neighborhood) and acting are all excellent. Toni Collette, especially when she flips between moods show an incredible range and dedication to the role.",Null,9,17,13 June 2018
The Babadook," Further viewings will flesh out the subtext
","After watching it a second time, I realized there's more to this movie than at first glance.The acting is superb. Great atmospheric score and timing and selection of sound effects adds to the viewing. Simple settings also draw one into the film.Second viewing opens up themes about psychological pain of losing loved ones, the insidious influence of having untreated trauma and stress. It's possible that the monster represents the mother's trauma and how she copes with it, with the ending being a realistic but disheartening revelation (quite refreshing from the tragic or resolving ending).",Null,0,0,11 November 2017
The Irishman," Woke DeNiro ruined this movie
","Technically supreme, but the deranged rantings of DeNiro against President Trump over the past three+ years has eliminated my ability to see him as an artist. He's an obnoxious, lie-riddled Soros activist/Good job, Bobby",Null,9,19,21 December 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Visually Stunning, Great Acting. Too bad the story just fell flat
","Seems to be a recent trend in adventure/superhero movies to have this theme of diversity and multiculturalism and tolerance as this pinnacle of a society, and the villain or conflict coming from those who want to resist that.Fine, if you're five years old. But if anyone has paid any attention to global events over the past, say, five years, open borders hasn't exactly worked out so good and in fact is quite disastrous for those having to live 'on the ground level.'So, basically, I am saying that I wish the producers would give the audience some credit and start writing some stories that actually reflect the world we are living in, if only allegorically through these movies.",Null,0,4,14 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Oozes woke
","One just gets the sense that this movie took a subtle yet noticeable shift away from what captured many people's hearts in the earlier MCU movies.The actors give off the feeling of being forced to portray a role that used to be natural fits in order to impose various woke messages. There are so many but they come at a rate of every couple of minutes, ranging from blatant grrl power, to emasculation and so on. Muddling along.Aside from the odd action scenes, this movie could pass as a drama.",Null,87,145,3 August 2019
Silence," A well laid-out film
","Technically superb, and the attention to detail helps the movie's pacing and context. Little superfluousness and extravagant scenes keep the Japanese mode of minimalism and efficiency front and center in a movie that has deep spiritual meaning.And I do not wish to second-guess the writers when I speak of the theme of the film: whether Japan is justified in maintaining a rigid social order using violence when faced with Christianity. How one views Silence depends on their perception of social order and this is why Silence ends up being about more than 17th century Japan. Christianity heavily centers around FAITH - that one's suffering and calling to speak out against oppression may meet up with a force that dominates on the earthly realm.",Null,0,1,20 May 2017
Midsommar," Slow pace establishes the perfect ending
","Part psychological horror, the subtheme of Midsommar is about roots and finding one's place. A metaphor for how our destinies play out when conflicting forces are at play. Dani feels her abandonment by her family as so devastating that she falls prey to the cult. In her eyes, things were both in and outside her control.
But to the viewer, we see someone almost willingly walking towards a conclusion.The soundtrack is mesmerizing, and the slow pacing creates a brooding suspenseOverall, a horror movie that deserves cult status",Null,4,9,22 April 2020
The Shape of Water," Blatant Oscar pandering
","Boring, stale tropes of the evil corporations/military oppressors over the misunderstood and gentle working class.Classic cultural marxist drivel.",Null,3,8,5 June 2018
There Will Be Blood," Atmospheric Soundtrack was superb
","Sparse at times, dramatic at others, the music in There Will Be Blood acts to regulate your engagement. By building up to a crescendo, the listener is watching a movie that calls for your full attention. The characters are from a specific era yet you can sense that the dramatic process is a universal one. Each of us watches There Will Be Blood and identifies with the players who are bound by fate to follow forces they had no hand in making.",Null,0,2,26 February 2017
Life," Engaging morality in the face of adversity
","Underneath the common alien monster movie is the message of optimism may not necessarily be a good thing when reality comes crashing down. Also, that no matter how many safeguards are put in place, events sometimes conspire to render them ineffective.I liked how at various times in the film, the protagonists succumbed to desire, selfishness, bravery and having it result in more misery and disaster. We are treated to great acting, soundtrack and special effects while offering up a stern lesson about how good intentions often go awry.Recommended.",Null,0,0,22 October 2017
Annihilation," Fans of H.P. Lovecraft may enjoy
","HPL's story 'The Color out of Space' was, I am guessing, one of the inspirations for this story ('Invasion of the Body Snatchers' elements as well).For the visuals alone - creatures, vegetation etc - I recommend this movie. The movie at times gets bogged down in dialogue but that is just an opinion. A slow suspenseful build up to a gripping ending makes it worth it.",Null,4,8,12 March 2018
The Nice Guys," Vague Pedophilia
","Although at first glance, this seems like a delightful buddy cop movie, with stylish costumes and sets from the 1970s Los Angeles era, further reflection compelled me to write this review as a warning for future viewers.In the scene where Ryan Gosling's 14-year old daughter follows him and Crow to a drug-fueled party as part of a case they were working on, we witness the your girl being exposed to hardcore pornography and no one really bats an eye. Subtle wearing down of our inherent revulsion at child abuse.This is now in light of Russell Crowe being used by Weinstein (notorious lech) to help scrub an expose in the New York Times in 2004.'Weinstein, Matt Damon and Russel Crowe pressured her to stop her hit piece, the story was gutted.'",Null,0,1,9 October 2017
Alien: Covenant," Disappointing follow-up
","For some reason, this movie went on a pretty wide detour from the preceding Prometheus (which set the audience up for a movie with as much scope and cosmic implication).So although Covenant can stand on its own as an adventure sci-fi from the angle of colonist preparation and awareness (as opposed to a militaristic theme like 'Aliens'). This is why Covenant is given a so- so rating. There are numerous problems that most reviewers have covered so far, so I won't go into them. But the fact the crew failed to ensure basic protection when exploring the alien planet either means lazy script writing, or some subtle dig at optimistic people (?).Back to the main point: Prometheus set the audience up for high expectations that Covenant failed to deliver.",Null,6,12,1 June 2017
