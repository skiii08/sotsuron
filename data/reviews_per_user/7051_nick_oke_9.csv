The Blair Witch Project," A project which was bound to disappoint
","A movie that only works if you think it's real - rather difficult when it's been hyped beyond all reason for six months before it opens!I didn't so much watch the film as study it - the clever use of the handheld cameras, the disorientation of the viewer, the improvised script. I wondered how much of the participants' reactions were real and how much were acted. I wondered if the directors were really hiding in the trees and disturbing the actors in the middle of the night.And that's the problem - the concept of the whole project got in the way. The sensationalist mass media world we live in today, where information is available at the fingertips 24 hours a day, cannot sustain the 'believablity' required to make this a great scary movie. Orson Welles' War of the Worlds could not happen today.A huge disappointment, and certainly not the scariest movie ever.",Null,0,1,23 July 2002
Se7en," Stunning
","One of those films that cause you to leave the cinema in a daze. A film about many things: fate, retribution, sin, religion, evil, society.A tale about a serial killer who murders people for their sins, and a mismatched buddy cop duo who must stop him before they too become part of his 'game'. When you break it down to its basics you realise that this could have been a disaster - Joel Schumacher directs Seagal and Van Damme in a shoot 'em up action movie where our heroes save the girl in the nick of time...The fact that the story works so well is testament to Fincher's marvellous vision and the performances of Spacey, Freeman & Pitt. The depth and originality that are added draw us into the picture and make us care about the characters. Think for moment: in a movie about a serial killer, how many people do we actually witness being slain? This isn't Jason or Freddie. What makes this scary is that John Doe is presented as a real person - a guy from the big, dirty, rainy city who just might live in the apartment below you. The fact that he is not just a random psycho who kills due to irresistable urges or the cycle of the moon makes him so much more frightening.For sheer edge-of-the-seat cinema, the final twenty minutes are as good as any you will see. All of the pieces of the jigsaw come together and - unfortunately - they fit perfectly...",Null,0,0,29 July 2002
Memento," ...think might you as good as Not
","Very, very clever - making the audience empathise with the lead character by manipulating the time line. Not since 'The Usual Suspects' have I seen a film which so cleverly played with the viewer's perceptions as the central plot device. The sheer effort required to study every detail of every scene ensures that you just can't take your eyes away from the screen for a second in case you miss something. However...Without the reversal of the time line the movie is a low-key affair with some OK acting and artistic camera work: Guy Pearce makes a passable hero and Joe Pantoliano obviously wishes his surname were Pesci instead.But after the final frame of the film I had that feeling of 'so what' which is the dread of every film fan - at least when you know a film is crap before you see it, you're never disappointed by it - occasionally you find that it's not as bad as you were told.But when a film is lauded as a landmark and voted into a top 10 placing as a result, you expect a little more. This film is a long way from crap though - the problem is that the concept IS the film and it can't quite carry the plot. Consequently, you're left with a feeling of resentment at having to expend all of the effort required to unravel the mystery.",Null,0,2,8 December 2002
The Terminator," Typecasting?
","The perfect role for Arnold - an emotionless, musclebound robot who talks monotonously in a series of mono-syllables. Pity he thought that he could act after this, but on balance, I forgive him as this is one of the best sci-fi thrillers ever. Better than the sequel? In that respect it is similar to Alien/Aliens - the shift in emphasis makes comparison very difficult. Personally, I prefer to look at all four movies as classics in their own right.But give Cameron his due, rather than retreading old ground with his main characters, Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley are fully rounded and deeply affected by their experiences. No Jamie Lee scream queens here. Compare the burger-flipping waitress in Terminator with the gun-toting borderline psycho in T2. It's almost as though she's turned into an emotionless, musclebound robot...",Null,1,1,29 July 2002
American Beauty," It's life
","As with all movies that gain a deal of critical acclaim, win awards and make a pot of cash, the comments on these pages veer from 'the greatest movie ever made' to 'overrated garbage'. And I knew before I had even clicked on Favorites that this would be no exception.But reading through the comments here, barely ten minutes after having viewed the film, I am drawn to one particular contribution, the gist of which is that you either get it or you don't. I did... but I can understand the comments of those who didn't. To those people I would like to say one thing:You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry, you will someday...",Null,0,0,31 December 2002
The Game," Don't believe the hype
","As usual, Fincher's darkly stylish themes are to the fore - in lesser hands this could have been a disaster. But ultimately, the far-fetched ending lets it down: it's like one of those elaborate jokes which go on for twenty minutes only to have a punchline like 'Rudolph The Red knows rain, dear'. To suggest, as have some comments below, that this is Fincher's best work is an even bigger joke. It provides an interesting segue from 'Se7en' into 'Fight Club' but is certainly inferior to both. Compare and contrast with Scorcese's 'After Hours'.",Null,0,1,10 November 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Religious musings?
","Reading through the comments by other contributors here, I begin to realise the reason why this movie features in so many all time top 10s - the film means different things to different people.As straightforward prison drama it is head and shoulders above others of its type - an epic story told with sensitivity and emotion, superbly acted and brilliantly shot. What makes what would have been a good film into a great one is the subtexts and themes which run through it that allow the viewer to actually think.Personally, my more recent viewings of the movie have highlighted the religious subtext - the way that Red is influenced to 'get busy livin' (and find his way to the Promised Land) as a result of meeting Andy, the Crucifixion/Resurrection/Redemption metaphor of Andy's escape as he stands with his arms wide letting the rain wash away everyone else's sh*t/sins.To be honest, I hate it when people try to look too deeply into art and identify supposed meaning of which the artist probably had no intention at all. I might be way off with these religious musings but the fact that I have been stirred to comment on them merely reinforces the power of this movie in the way that it can move us.",10,1,2,13 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I must have missed something
","I was 10 years old when Star Wars was released. I had the merchandise (pen, ruler, lunchbox, frisbee), I was smack in the middle of the target audience, all of my mates loved it. So why does this film leave me cold? I want to like it, honestly. It should be a defining movie moment for someone of my age - the film that held an entire generation in spellbound rapture.I think I can answer my own question by referring to the opening titles of the film. The fact that this took place 'In a galaxy far, far away' made it unreal and something to which I will always fail to relate. That is probably why I consider Close Encounters a better way to spend two-and-a-bit hours of my life.And another thing, why does this feature in the top 5 of so many 'all time' lists? I can name more than five better movies made in the 70's alone.If you've never seen Stars Wars take my advice - if you want sci-fi try Blade Runner; if you want adventure try Raiders of the Lost Ark; if you want humour and a bit of romance try Aladdin.Just say no kids.",Null,1,2,15 July 2002
Goodfellas," Joe Pesci - a funny guy
","Pesci gives one of the finest cinema performances of recent years. He encapsulates the mood of the film - funny, disturbed, violent and with a total disregard for other people's lives. Yet we still love him!The 'funny how?' monologue in the restaurant is one of the great movie speeches, right up there with 'you talkin to me?' and 'tears in the rain'. It is there that we discover just who we are going to spend the next couple of hours with - a borderline psycho with a sense of humour! A man who recreates the western 'dancing' scene with real bullets, a man who cold-bloodedly assassinates Sam Jackson's doped up musician then asks his dim-witted sidekick to make the coffee 'to go'.If I ever meet Mr Pesci I'd like to think I had the bottle to thank him for one of my favourite movie turns. Or maybe I'll just ask him to go get his shine box...",10,0,2,13 July 2002
