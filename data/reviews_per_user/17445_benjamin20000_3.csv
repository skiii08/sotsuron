The Ring," Worst remake ever !
","It's so cliched and falsely profund. I watched that film because my brother said it was one of the best horror flicks ever. I thought it was just plain dumb. Visually, the film is good. Beautiful style. But the plot is just a complete non-sense.",1,1,4,6 April 2003
Resident Evil," Revolutionary score !
",This film would be nothing without the Manson/Beltrami score. The film is very unrealistic and a bit stupid but very effective. I had never been scared like this before... The ending is just awesome. Best video game adaptation ever! Acting is not so good though... Paul Anderson is still a so-so director but this is unquestionably his best achievement so far.,6,0,0,6 April 2003
Grindhouse," Unique cinema experience!
","Grindhouse is a unique cinema experience. I'm 21 years old, I've seen a lot of B-movies (on VHS or DVD) and I've never experienced anything like this. The cheap retro B-movies that Grindhouse honours have never reached the movie theaters of my northern city, Montreal. Words cannot express the joy and excitement I felt watching these two films on the big screen. The grindhouse experience brought all the viewers together... like a special bond. We all laughed and felt sick in unison. Even the 80 years old man sitting next to me joined in. The young man sitting behind me fainted during Planet Terror, we took care of him... gave him water and escorted him out of the projection room. It was a close community that lasted 3 and a half hours.I don't want to spoil the experience for those of you who haven't seen it. I'll just say this:Planet Terror is one of the best zombie films I've seen in my whole life.Death proof is more character driven. It has the most satisfying ending I have ever seen. It just delivered.Mr. Rodrigez, Mr. Tarantino... thank you SO much.",10,0,3,29 April 2007
