The Blair Witch Project," Cool Movie, way out there
","I recently saw this movie and loved it solely because of the way it was filmed. I honestly don't think it was scary, except for the end which I SO won't tell, but if it had been filmed in another form besides with lousy cameras by a bunch of kids, the movie wouldn't have the same impact. It seemed so real because of that. I enjoyed it very much, but i think people have to look at it as a film acheivment rather than an actual motion picture. People I know either laugh or shudder when I told them I was going to watch this movie, so I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard that it seemed so real from a few people that I really wanted to watch it. I don't scare easily, so I congratulate the makers of this movie for making me think and completely getting inside my head. Movies like this where you can not separate what is fake from what is really going on never cease to amaze me. If you liked this movie, rent The Exorcist, too...the only other movie I've ever been scared of.",10,2,4,16 November 2006
To Kill a Mockingbird," Woah!
","I just saw this movie for the first time. I read the book about a year ago and i am glad i waited to see the movie. Although the movie is a bit different from the book, it is one of the best screen adaptations i have ever seen (along with Mystic River) and i am awed all over again by the underlying message in this movie!I am thrilled that i have to read this again in High School simply so i can make sure i have gathered everything there is to get out of both the book and the movie. This is definitely a timeless classic that will be kept in my collection forever. Even my younger brother who usually has no tolerance for movies like this, much less something in black and white, sat through it and actually got something from it. I would watch this movie 100 more times.",10,1,3,28 January 2007
