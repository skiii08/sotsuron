Ford v Ferrari," Fast Paced, Pure Thrill, What More Could We Ask For
","Interesting story overall, great acting, and a surprise ending for this true story. It would be hard to image non auto racing fans not enjoying this thrill ride.",9,3,6,20 November 2019
Captain Marvel," If mediocre was ever a cinematic theme, we have arrived people.
","Wait for the DVD, very bland and predictable. Very disappointing and boring.",4,9,16,8 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Worthy effort
","Worthy effort, but to a point. This film felt like you were on an adventure. The acting was well pursued, as was the timing. JJ abs had a huge gap to fill and with this he cleared some things up. I personally could of held out another year to explore certain things better but overall felt satisfied with what tools they had and time allowed. I left the theater feeling like the force awakens had some closure along with a part 2, even though it's the third installment of the trilogy.",8,4,13,20 December 2019
