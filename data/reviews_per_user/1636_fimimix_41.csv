"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," ..a tragi-comedy not to be missed..
","As EVERY comment has pointed-out, 'Priscilla' is about two drag-queens and a trans-gendered performer who get on the bus in Sidney and take a perilous journey through the outback of Australia to do a gig at 'Alice Springs'. I won't comment on too much of the plot, because that's the secret of this most entertaining movie. I am DELIGHTED there were so few negative reviews. I am NOT surprised that those who loved it, truly did - they were almost all female or gay, but also a couple of 'heterosexual' males....plus some married folk who certainly have open minds and/or know some 'dragons'.....maybe some plain-ole gays.I particularly loved the innocent-but-wise attitude of 'Mitzi's' (Hugo Weaving) son.....I think there are a lot more little guys like him, but mom and dad just don't know about it. 'Mom' (June Marie Bennett ?) certainly was a wild-but-clever enough woman to educate him about his dad - why wouldn't he like him? 'Alice Springs' looked a lot like Las Vegas - I think it had some off-color business going-on there; I'm sure you noticed one of the parking-attendants screamed 'here are the drag-queens' without batting an eyelash, and the audience wasn't all that excited about the show. The situation between dad and son was one of the 'tragi-comedies' which didn't materialize -one of the heart-warming sub-plot of this beautifully-told screamer. 'Bob' (Paul Hunter) played his role with ultimate skill; that does happen, as 'Brokeback Mountain' proclaims. Female-impersonators have 'stage-door Johnnies' you wouldn't believe.......This is dangerous territory for me to write about: some of you will know from my other reviews that I am a retired drag-queen-female-impersonator......I could write volumes. However, some other 'users' have poignantly written about the hidden tragedies in 'Priscilla'; I hope others have read those reviews and understood the message. I just want to make a couple of factual remarks.These performers were outrageous 'drag-queens', NOT 'female-impersonators'. The latter entertainers attempt to look and be as feminine as possible, in every detail - taking themselves dead-seriously. They see 'drag-queens' as campy freaks - they seldom want to be associated with them, in comparison. In professional revues, however, it's the 'freaks' who usually are most popular, if they get their stuff together. 'Bernie' (Terrance Stamp), 'Mitzi' (Hugo Weaving) and 'Felicia' (Guy Pearce) gave fantastic performances, and would reign supreme in many American clubs, because it was apparent they did-but-didn't take themselves seriously.......in performing. Lizzy Gardner provided costumes ANY 'drag-queen' would give their eye-teeth for (and maybe another vital part of their body) . BRAVA, Liz ! How do I know? I performed for decades as an attractive female-impersonator with gorgeous wigs and costumes - and talent - but, discovered how wonderful it was to be a 'drag-queen' for the last part of my career (I really don't take that term seriously.) I called myself a 'drag-queen', because I had the pleasure of working with many and admired them greatly.To 'Michael-3B', 'LesGirls' was a fabulously successful nightclub in Sidney that featured female-impersonators AND drag-queens. It toured all over the Asian-Pacific. There are several more clubs in a certain area of Sidney where 'drag' is featured and many gay people congregate. 'Bernie' portrays one of the original performers, who actually did become trans-gendered - she visited a club I worked in in Los Angeles. She did a 'guest-performance'.....a lovely person. That such an outrageous film would ever be filmed in Australia is astounding. Not too many years ago, ANY gay person could not get into that country, as could not Blacks nor Orientals. Homophobia was the country's second name. It wasn't until the AIDS-epidemic did it become acceptable for gays to even be recognized, but it took a lot of screaming and kicking. NOW-A-DAYS, Australia - especially Sidney - is full of 'drag'........a second club was opened in Kowloon (China), to which I was going from Hawai'i. Sissy ME in China ? Not on your life.Americans cannot get it straight about men who dress as women; they are all lumped into the term 'transvestites'. SURPRISE; 'transvestites' are straight men who like to dress-up in women's clothing, and would not dare to leave home in that attire until recent years. SURPRISE NUMBER TWO; their wives couldn't care less, and usually accompany their husbands when they go out into public, especially to gay bars. So, all you macho numbers, we've been onto you for a very long time.I agree that Terrance Stamp played his role with vivid feeling. There are so many people like that character, but we want to think of them as being eternally, ecstatically beautiful. T'ain't so - the most successful trangendered-sex-changes are the ones you don't know about.The cinematography of Australia was breath-taking - there was plenty of room for those miles of flying fabric on 'Priscilla'. I can attest every drag-show in THIS country tried to imitate it. Stephen Elliott certainly brought-out the very best in the entire cast; unlike some 'users', I didn't find one weak scene in the entire movie; I DID in that American 'Thank You, Julie Newmar' thing. The songs by Abba were so appropriate - who dares to think they're dated? The last song on MY VHS is one sung by Whitney Houston (I think), and is so appropriate. I worked with a performer who sang it 'live', just as well. So touching....I shall inform you I have a 'critic' of my reviews, whose opinion of this one should be scalding. 'Priscilla' is delicious, may it live forever - yes, it did deserve an Oscar. I also suggest that those folk who didn't enjoy it should watch it several times again, to truly understand the sub-plots - and see Guy Pearce's fine buns.........you know I give it a 20.....",10,13,19,10 October 2006
Black Swan," ..it's only a movie that makes you think..
","I truly don't understand why some of the reviewers hate this film so ! You never know if you are going to enjoy a movie - however weird or boring - it is 'til you've seen it. I fully intended to buy this title, to start replacing thousands of titles I gave-away or threw-out....wish I still had them all......Although the sex-scenes in this film truly shocked me, it wasn't the first time I've been shocked before. As the movie unraveled and we saw how the childish-but-brilliant dancer 'The Swan' (Natalie Portman) was maturing (through masturbation) was beginning to survive the fanatic dominance of her mother (Barbara Hershey), it should have prepared us for the not-so-unusual scene with 'Lily' (Mila Kunis) - every ballet-themed film I've ever seen has had mucho sex-scenes, of all kinds....except for 'The Red Shoes'. I respect one's preference in sexual matters, but we DO need to be aware that our own preference isn't the only one. As many have written, there are lots of other strange goings-on in this movie, which make it the interesting film it is. I was not aware that director Darren Aronofsky is especially famous for his unusual plots - also unfamiliar with scriptor Marc Heyman; but, I don't go to see any particular film to see what its creators are presenting. I'm hoping to find a plot that isn't readily foreseeable, and will provide me with a different story.The only disappointment with the untidy-and-quick method the ballet-company's lead dancer was disposed-of. No doubt, there was much more to this story than was presented in tne finished product.Not to give-away too much of the plot, I will only say 'The Red Shoes' also featured a brilliant ballerina determined to destroy herself than not be able to dance. I shall also let you know ballerina Margot Fonteyne added years to her career with the arrival into the company by a fabulous, Russian male-cancer (many years her junior). The method of self-destruction was different and more understandable than 'The Black Swan' used, but any true artist does live for their art, whether they can adjust to catastrophic changes in their careers, or not.I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Black Swan' and got its message immediately. I look forward to many move viewings, because I always find something different in every viewing. Those folk who only like one kind of film certainly narrow-mindedly limit their enjoyment (and life's-knowledge) by not finding the true message of any film, no matter what genre it is. Bravo! for 'The Black Swan'.....",10,1,2,23 May 2011
Ghost," ..not much without Whoopi..
","...and she wasn't even listed as one of the actresses !! Can you imagine this movie without her ? Of course she over-acted in every scene - what else? This movie needed all the help it could get. I couldn't see where in New York City this film was shot, but that's the way it looks, guys. SO chic to have a million-dollar loft in dangerous parts of the city.I think Patrick Swayze and Demie more and Tony Goldman (and the many extras) did their roles o.k., such as they were. I don't think Jerry Zucker could have done much more with Bruce Rubin's script. I suspect there was a lot of re-writing as the movie was filmed. The love-story aspect was good - thank heavens Swayze had 'the subway-ghost' to teach him........I thought it was a much more recent movie - sure I saw an ad in the local paper for it. Re-release? At least the cinematography was good.Without Whoppie Goldberg, hang it up. If you want a good 'Ghost' movie, take a look at 'City of Angels'...........",8,0,1,11 August 2006
Lifeboat," ..so few people have seen this great work..
","Again, I watched 'Lifeboat' tonight - and, again, I read every commentary posted here. AND - again - I'm asking myself how the couple of folk who gave it a 'phew' revue could be so assured it is a piece of junk, when were unfamiliar with the acting-skills of a film made so many years ago, nor they've never been in anything near the situation of surviving in a lifeboat. I wouldn't even go to sea in one of those mega-ships; don't even suggest a skiff ! Actually, though, lifeboats are larger than we generally picture - they had to accommodate a number of people. There are a couple of long-range shots of the boat which shows it is larger than we visualize.Only one commentator gave the film's age - 60 years !; only one commentator wrote that director Alfred Hitchcock considered ONLY Tallulah Bankhead for the female-lead. Several mentioned that Ms. Bankhead was a terror on the stage, so we can certainly assume she gave a lot of input to Hitchcock on how she would build this character. Many wrote that she was not cast in many movies - our loss !! Because the entire film was based-on close-ups, this is a testament to her beauty and skill in acting.I was taken aback again on how scrawny John Hodiak looked in the movie, as he was one of the big box-office hotties in that period. His acting was superb, but the body needed a lot of work for the bully he played.We all know by now that he took-over as captain of the lifeboat, but was bested by the rescued, German U-Boat captain - sneakily condescending for his own safety - by Walter Slezak - skillful ! As the movie was purposefully intended to show the reaction of dissimilar characters in a desperate situation, few people commented on the wonderfully-under-played role by a young-and-handsome sailor, Hume Cronyn. William Bendix was William Bendix, although he got higher billing than both Hodiak and Cronyn. Remarkably, no one commented on Canada Lee's question 'I get to vote, too?', in those days a loaded line by a Black actor. I was engrossed in how these dissimilar people reacted to one another. I really didn't see this film as a huge, political statement. I only saw raw emotions - well depicted.AGAIN - I wish to explain that I do not watch movies because of certain actors-actresses - although Bankhead was one of my favorites - I love the movie, as a whole. I was lucky to see it when it was first released and have NEVER lost interest in it. 'Lifeboat' is a true-to-life, suspenseful thriller that never drags nor gets boring - it's got my 10-to-10....",10,6,6,19 May 2006
Chinatown," ..now I know what a 'film-noir' is..
","...and I lived right through that era - even before ! I guess people use that term to let you know they are 'hip' about film-parlance. I'd call it drama........'Chinatown' CERTAINLY is a classic, because - as many people noted - it is so nearly perfect. Robert Towne wrote the best screenplay; Boo! to 'Citizen Kane' being the best ! AND, it's in rich color - colors that we see and feel. Some commentators noticed how glamorous Ms. Dunaway was, how lovely the autos were, the open lushness of the early San Fernando Valley before it was cannibalized by greedy developers. In the late 30s and 40s, there WERE ranches out here more than a-square-mile.The film did not bring-out why Chinatown was considered to be as dangerous as sections of Los Angeles is now - because of the Chinese 'tongs' - referred to once but not really explained. Who even knows, today, what they were? Mention 'MS13' and almost everyone will know what it is - one of the most vicious gangs in the country, which is finally experiencing how it has spread. A 'tong' was the Chinese version: if you were Chinese, you belonged to one of its thousands of families, no matter in which city you mention - very similar to The Mafia families. Today, we know that the Chinese race is not the scum it was labeled to be; couldn't even become citizens after opening-up The West. They moved south to Mexico: many Mexicans have slanted eyes because of inter-marriage. I once heard Chinese being spoken with the musical lilt of Spanish - beautiful !The USA was beginning to come alive again, POST-depression - movies helped its citizens escape the drudgery of every-day life. The best movies were produced then - so many fabulous film-stars. Can you use more than one hand to compare today's stars with them? Nah........everyone told the story: detective film....It is my opinion Nicholson's role was so effective because Polanski allowed him to be himself - not much acting here. Dunaway was the perfect 'femme-fatale'. Polanski's bit-part certainly didn't cause any sensation - most likely to save money, although his direction was brilliant. Huston was the epitome of depravity and megalomania - 'The future, the future?' He may have stolen the vastness of The Valley, but it was his partner - Hollis L. Mulwray - who made it bloom by opening the valves to bring-in the water - 'there it is, take it'. You can still find those 'steps' the water cascades down into a reservoir where they found his body. Anyone know the name of that steep, winding road down the mountains and across present-day Freeway 101 ? Very similar......Towne just switched the spelling, because that family is still very powerful in Los Angeles....Mulwray wasn't murdered, that's a Hollywood story; he brought the water in and lived to a ripe old-age.All the ingredients were magically mixed to make this wonderful movie. If directors-actors-actresses-producers fought during the making of film in that era, they knew they were doing important work - it can't be repeated today. Every re-make is surely to be doomed. That 'Chinatown' was produced so like the REAL classics is a miracle. Yes, there are wonderful, modern film, but they are of a different genre: why? The originals had STORIES ! The only reason younger generations can 'review' them is through the miracle of preservation on VHS and DVD. They've missed the real thing......If you like good dialog, under-played action and skillful cinematography, then 'Chinatown' is a movie for you - if you do not like to wait till character-development can be done, then watch James Bond. If a modern-day star wants to be really noticed, let them arrive at The Academy Awards with that era's look and glamorous gowns - not one of the stringy-haired stars could compete.Indeed, 'Chinatown' is a film that can survive for ever. It shows what most people have missed, but some can still revel in......Bravo!",10,1,2,29 June 2006
Citizen Kane," ..at least, I liked the opera..
","Although only 'one-of-one' reviewers thought 'Elle S.A.'s' comments were noteworthy, please read that comment to understand all the technical innovations 'Citizen Kane' pioneered. I appreciate Welles' genius, but liked him in 'The Stranger' much better than this movie. All through his career, he started many 'masterpieces', but never completed them. THAT, as much as Hearst's campaign to prohibit 'Citizen Kane' from being distributed to theaters (he even tried to buy the original print from RKO, but it was owned outright by Welles), no doubt hampered his being able to get funding for future work.I am amazed that people consider 1941 as having been in the dark-ages of film-making......wouldn't 1921 be a more appropriate era ? There were many wonderful movies made before 1941....'Gone with the Wind' ?? 'Kane's' re-release in 1950 - after ten years of rampant curiosity over the controversy about it - had as much to do with its popularity as Welles' brilliance, simply because black-and-white movies were old-hat by then. I'm sure I saw its original release, but I don't recall being smitten with anything near 'best picture I've ever seen'. I guess I also saw it on TV; same comment. It wasn't until 2006 that I bought the VHS from eBay.........I've watched it twice since then (once last night) - and while I certainly agree it's a great movie - I truly can't say I'm flabbergasted by it. Maybe the DVD will give me a greater appreciation for it. I saw the floral 'Rosebud' on the kid's sled and recognized all through the movie Kane was looking for the happpiness he could never buy with all his money. He was ruthlessly narcissistic.Am I mistaken that Kane's 'mother' (Agnes Moorehead) gave him up to 'Thatcher' (George Coulouris) after the property they owned became worth a lot of money - like gold ??? - 75 million would have made him a billionaire, today. I DID like the opera-scenes, and suffered right along with 'Susan Kane' (Dorothy Comingore), off-pitch and all. I'm impressed that this movie was Joseph Cotten's (Jed Leland) American debut as I am with Welles. Ruth Warwick (Emily Kane) impressed me not, but was good for the role. Ray Collins' (Boss Gettys) acting was right-on, as was Everett Sloane as 'Mr. Bernstine' (?). The cinematography was great, but some camera-angles had been used in other movies.As for Welles' aging make-up, does anyone remember the fantastic make-up jobs done by Lon Chaney in his horror-films - 'Phantom of the Opera'? I have to constantly remind myself that people who are younger than the film usually are more easily astounded than we older folk are, who have seen it all develop. I'm sure I'd have to argue with 'Citizen Kane' being proclaimed as NUMBER ONE on any list - my enjoyment is mine, others' are respected, but it has no influence on me. The movie did not make me cry, I wasn't shocked, I wasn't frightened, I wasn't impressed with everything looking so huge and forbidding; in other words, I've enjoyed other movies more. I only mourn that artists get so wrapped-up in themselves - as Welles was - they are their own worst enemies.Declaring movies (and movie-making) as being 'perfect' and 'the best film ever' are different for every individual. It's my opinion a lot of that is because Welles had total control of the film - he must have done an amazing acting-job to get that privilege. It doesn't mean that he didn't have many techs working with him. Bravo! to all, but most of that 'greatest' obsession is uncalled for, in my opinion.",10,0,2,29 October 2006
Amistad," ..freedom is not a given..
","What a lovely sentiment 'it is our right at birth'.....'sometimes it has to be taken' is often the case. How tragic the countries in Africa are still slaughtering, enslaving their own citizens....breaking females' legs so they cannot escape during rape. Comparing 'Amistad' with those current facts sends the message it's never changed, just how it's done and why. This film let us see the workings of our country when it was young.I didn't read so many of the other comments, because I knew this movie is not widely-known. How sad that some thought it was a drag; it takes time to develop such a tragic plot. Although the beginning of it was gruesome, it had no explosions to color the screen. What colored the screen was the agony humans inflict on one another - it also wasn't important to me what other viewers thought of the film, because I've studied it enough to know my opinion will never change - it deserves a '30'. I WAS surprised that Morgan Freeman got top billing over Hopkins; I'm a big fan of Freeman, but that's stretching it some. McConaughey was brilliant, as all were who played in the movie - cardboard characters, or not - The 'entertainers' were just as important to the story as was Hopkins, whose soliloquy . I understood every word - the scenes between McConaughey and Hounsou were spell-binding. The 'Bible' scene was particularly touching. 'Cinque' may not have spoken English, but he certainly could discern the animosity in the early court-scenes:'....give us free'.....broke my heart, because it is STILL a plea heard in today's world. The empathy between the lowly lawyer and the freed black man in The Supreme Court spoke volumes....the slaughter of the slaves by drowning came immediately to my mind. But, the most poignant of that topic was the young mother who silently slipped, with her baby, into the ocean.After the fireworks of the destruction of the slave-fortress, and the ultimate happiness of the Mendes sailing home - only to learn their people have been sold into slavery - trumpets the criminal selling of females in The Mid-East into prostitution.Spielberg has created a timeless, raceless masterpiece. Yes, every individual needs to see this movie, to understand that slavery of some kind is prevalent in every society. 'Amistad' is a must-see for all.",10,0,1,7 June 2006
Billy Elliot," ..dance-on billy..
","I'm so happy to see so many people love this movie - to me, it is a textbook for overly-spoiled American kids. It is just wonderful to be able to relate to the problems in this family, and then seeing them getting resolved. Billy is a revelation - I love grandma !! All that background story about the mines and the comedy that's in it - then the sudden break-down of Dad - is so real-life. I wasn't the least bit surprised to see the little, sissy boy in there - and thought Billy was a champ the way he handled it. The ballet-teacher was a female drag-queen, and wonderful.....I wonder if she picked-up her daughter was hot for Billy? The whole story was so full of every-day happenings, but the grandest theme and point made was the total turn-around by Dad. I had the greatest empathy with him when they went to the ballet-school. He knew he was way out-of-place, but stuck to his plan to do the best he could by a son he didn't truly understand.As others have written, the ending was so appropriate - the sissy all grown-up with her lover and in drag, and those two macho miners not the least bit bothered. To have Billy be the star in Bourne's 'Swan Lake' was a shocker - but should have been expected. How many Americans do you think have seen that ballet ? This kind of movie tears me up, because they are so real - keep them coming ! Double-bravo to all -",10,1,2,16 May 2006
Brokeback Mountain," A Tragedy of Life
","I've read only one comment; while I agree with it, please read some of the other comments which give you details of the plot. If you haven't loved strongly, without knowing you do only to discover it is part-and-parcel of your life, it is impossible to get the true meaning of this film.The comment I read predicted a 'take-off' for Ledger's (del Mar) career: I wonder! Although 'Brokeback Mountain' is primarily about HIS aimless drifting through life and his performance breathed reality into that morass, I'd never heard of him; that he would be black-balled for his accepting this role would be a tragedy. However, Hollywood isn't nearly as liberal as most people think. Jake G. (Jack) has made several films; only 'Day after Tomorrow' (so far) is nearly as good as his role in this film. 'Jarhead' - while the acting is good, he certainly doesn't have any compulsions about appearing naked!, unlike the sweet character in 'Day' - is a waste, except to vividly depict how the USA turns very young men into 'macho' robots for killing. Society idolizes these men, then treats any homosexual tendency in them - or in a civilian life - as sinful.Yes, the old testament of The Bible condemns it; one can only feel that Jesus felt differently. This film is a perfect example of how hot-blooded males find love for another male, when they are isolated in an idyllic setting - or any ole place, if the chemistry is right. The recent scandal of soldiers in Iraq appearing on web-sites for prostitution is a wake-up call. 'Brokeback' depicts a true-to-life story of self-condemnation and fear of discovery, while living miserably in secrecy, on 'del Mar's' part. 'Alma' discovered where her husband's true love lay when she witnessed the two men kissing in the alley. The fact 'del Mar' never brought home a 'catch' after an impassioned dash to the mountain to meet 'Jack', her rage during the 'outing'-scene clearly depicted HER misery all through a failed marriage. 'Once I had an idea' and 'every six months!', as 'Jack' tells 'del Mar', are the revelations there is no other love for him. The scent of a shirt during 'del Mar's' visit to 'Jack's' parents brings it home clearly to 'del Mar' he has made his own misery. Whether we recognize it or not, we ALL know men who love one another. Today, it is more openly accepted, but is still a scandal in many parts of our 'enlightened' society.This film was robbed of its deserved academy awards. It will be difficult to produce another film with its clarion announcement: we have no right to judge others, and that love will be love no matter whom it finds. It also shows that we cannot be tolerant toward those who are different than ourselves, and how difficult it is to be compassionate toward other humans we don't understand. 'Brokeback Mountain' was superbly acted by every member of its cast. Mr. Ang directed a masterpiece, with the help of wonderful cinematography and a brilliant script. There are many films on this subject, but none so easily understood and openly presented as 'Brokeback Mountain'. Bravo!",10,28,33,30 April 2006
Crash," ...I thought I loved this movie...'Brokeback was robbed'...
","....while I was watching it.....I now realize, after reading so many other commentaries, that I was fascinated by the graphic assault of it. Now, I am so happy I did not see this in a theater - it is a film to experience alone.Some of the film is too true to endure.....there ARE areas of Los Angeles where it's safer to sleep on the floor....where people are not safe on the streets....where few people show compassion for others.... where poverty and blight prevent the residents from climbing out.... where merely living day-to-day is so difficult - yet, there isn't any other city I'd like to live in. I wonder if all those who wrote such negative commentaries are doing anything to make it better.All of the actors/actresses delivered their best - the sound was ponderous and crisp, the cinematography was excellent - the stories were believable which one could relate to, perhaps too easily if you live in Los Angeles - all of this made me yearn for the sweet story of 'City of Angels' - does anyone remember its quiet revelations, or believe it is - or could be - that way? No matter how healing the end of 'Crash' was supposed to be, it was too weak to relieve the demolition it portrayed....",3,2,9,30 April 2006
The Town," ..okay, but not great....
","I've been trying to think of what to write here - I wasn't thrilled and I didn't find much drama. FOR Ben Afleckt as director and actor, I guess he was pretty good.Not being a Boston former resident, nor a huge fan of that city, I will say I didn't know that Charlestown was a city of many criminals. The car-chases were fairly well done, the costumes were appropriate and different, I guess the plot was good (so many people compared it to other movies), and know not one iota about 'Charlestown'. I DID work right across the street from Fenway Park (behind that big wall with the scoreboard on it(, but have never been in there.SO, while the movie entertained me, I can't rave about the acting nor the story. Screamed at the 'nun'-outfits.....gotta take for granted they were put-on in the autos - if they saw them on the street, ANYONE would know something was up or they were going to a drag-party.I guess I'd watch it again (saw it on TV). but I don't think I'd pay to see it, nor buy the DVD. Maybe Aflleckt will have learned something from his work ??",5,1,2,2 April 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," ..Mr. McDaniel is a testimony to this tragedy..
","The very first commentary on this movie says it all. Although I also was living during this disaster, for some reason I was not aware of its affects on my family, who came to this country with great wealth in 1924. By 1930, it was bankrupt; I kept wondering why we were moving from the big house to a succession of smaller houses on the same property, then entirely off of it. Mine was such a happy childhood, I can only surmise the loss of wealth did not register with me. I don't even remember being aware of it; by the time my family became being near penniless, I was the only child left at home - I was the youngest. My parents' battle to win it is a testimony to their resiliency and bravery. My dad became a master-carpenter, and helped build-renovate many homes his wealth had helped other people to obtain. My mother became the town-sempstress, sewing garments she would not have worn in earlier days.I suspect I may had read 'The Grapes of Wrath' shortly after its publication; I was a precocious child. I know of my family's travails only from other family-members, during the Great Depression which could so easily happen again, for different reasons. I doubt seriously if today's citizens of this country - and the millions of immigrants - could survive one. Reading other commentaries on this movie, I wonder how-and-who decided it is of a communistic theme - I must have been too naive to grasp it from the novel. Although they were worlds apart in their cultures, my mother certainly was very much like Ma Joad, both angels on Earth. I proudly associate the two; my mom put-away her aristocratic demeanor to help pay my dad's bills. Ma Joad BECAME aristocratic through her gentility and compassion. I am so happy I inherited many of my mother's characteristics, because lineage means nothing to me. It's the person-as-is I love.'The Okies', although they received much less sympathy than those hordes who cross California's southern border with Mexico, brought the same magic power to California, because they did the dirty work. We politically correctly say, 'that's work we won't do' -hmmmmmm. One doesn't know what one would do, until a situation confronts them. Being retired from night-club entertaining, I view everyone as being equal: I often confronted individuals of foreign birth with unkind things to say about America. I could only smile and ask, 'If that is true, why is everyone in the world trying to get here?' Many of the commentators on this movie have written cogently about it. There is not much more I can add, except to say it causes me to weep for the goodness of the people during those times, when they had every reason to be evil. I see no comparison in the quality of the film to 'Citizen Kane', because that film is mostly fiction. 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a true-to-life historical telling of real situations. They are rampant all over the world, and in some parts of this nation. Let's pray they can be alleviated for everyone's good.I think Henry Fonda portrayed Tom Joad brilliantly, but don't see too much difference in his other roles. Perhaps he became a 'big star' because of his cunning, to choose roles that would fit him. I agree with those who write the awarding of his Oscar for 'On Golden Pond' was the culmination of a popularity contest. There is a dark rumor (in Hollywood) 'Pond's' theme wasn't all that fictional; in true life, Jane and Dad didn't get along that well.....Watch 'Grapes' as often as you can - there are many great lessons to be learned from it. It deserves every accolade given to it, and none of the tacky criticisms - it is pure art that just happens to depict a dreadful period of our history. I can't give anything but high praise for all who had a part in its production. 'Happy are those who are persecuted because they are good, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.'

Predator," ..pretty good movie..
","Although I am not usually a sci-fi fan, I did enjoy watching 'Predator'. I had no idea it was so old - maybe that's why I enjoyed it ! As other users have commented, we see the space-ship coming from the universe, but don't ever see it again. If it could get here, why can't it stick-around ?? AND - after all that gun-play at the camp where the 'minister' is supposed to be prisoner, what actually happened to the other members of his party? Did I miss that ? The scene where they shoot-up the camp is good, although one wonders how did they have all those weapons AND enough ammunition to continue to fire thousands of rounds in the jungle, at something they couldn't see ?Director John McTiernan kept the suspense high and his actors busy, from Jim and John Thomas' script. Arnold ('Dutch') actually looked good, orange hair and all. Carl Weathers ('Dillion') was excellent in his role, although they could have left-out that arm-wrestling scene in the beginning. I suspect they had some phonies glued on Arnold's arms. Elpidia Arillo ('Anna') did what she could with all those macho guys. Bill Duke ('Mac') played his role well. Jesse Chaves ('Blain') also was good, as all the others were. Jesse Ventura was pretty good, too. The 'creature' (Kevin Peter Hall) was imposing with his height and agility, but I DID see some human elbows between some of the plates.Camera-work was excellent, as were the locations. They added to the tension as the film progressed. I agree the cast did a good job showing the terror of being hunted, after so much gun-play as hunters. I don't think the writers could have put in anything else to show Arnold in all his splendor.Story-wise, not too bad. Because I waited so long to watch 'Predator,' and seeing the other sci-fi films mentioned herein before, I suppose it was no surprise to catch-on that 'Dutch' would be the one to fight him face-to-face. I WAS surprised to see the 'copter was still in the jungle, after all that action. I remember, now, that I saw 'Predator 2' first - I agree with all who liked 'Predator' better.....it was better.'Dutch' was right - 'Predator' was not too pretty.....and he was smart. I must agree that he existed on the carnage he provoked; I was surprised there were no bananas hanging on the trees.This movie was well-done, considering when it was released. Not too many special effects......but I saw a long list of stunt-people. All-in-all, I enjoyed watching 'Predator' - I had no idea it was considered to be a 'classic'.....gave it 10.....",10,2,4,14 May 2008
The Killing Fields," ..more USA meddling...
","For some reason, US presidents have the urge to attempt to influence governments in other sovereign nations. This MUST be to add to their legacy and for the history-books.....although their efforts seldom are successful and beneficial.....and are expensive.....and causes another country to dislike us. One would think they'd be content to have conditions in our country - as did Bill Clinton - to be as peaceful and prosperous as possible, FOR our own country. This perhaps may sound like protectionism - so be it. Had 'W' minded his own business, we wouldn't be faced with the decades of terrorism we are in for......just as Richard Nixon tried to hide his intervention in backing King Sihanouk in Cambodia.....think of Marlon Brando's role in 'Apocalypse Now'......those were Cambodians, folk......before Pol Pot began his genocide. Sihanouk's family is still heavily involved in Cambodia, although they are corrupt and ill-suited to lead. During the 50s and 60s, Sihanouk ruled a peaceful-looking country, but the 'pots' were boiling, toward 'the Killing Fields'. Although Pol Pot was 'convicted', he was never imprisoned; he died a natural death in the jungle.......So little of the USA's involvement in Cambodia is shown in the beginning of the film - a couple of jet-bombers and a few bombs dropped - journalist Schanberg's comment '$200-billion' meant nothing. Americans were exhausted from the fiasco - and so many deaths - in Vietnam, not much is known about the 1.5 millions-of-deaths in Cambodia. They just didn't want to hear it, although TV newscasts presented stories about refuge' camps. Nixon's sneaky intervention - he is shown in the film in a news-report swearing that USA planes would NOT bomb Cambodia, as they did as he spoke - was one of the ingredients that caused him to resign his office, when the Watergate scandal erupted......good riddance.To demonstrate how ignorant Americans are about Cambodia, many think it was the Vietnam War !! Wake-up 'FeinMess', 'RBarse' and 'OriginalmovieBuff21'......Many commentaries mention the cinematography is so realistic, the viewer is pulled into the story. Sam Waterson played a magnificent role. Rightly so, everyone was astounded by Haing S. Ngor's natural brilliance in his role. I would rather think he was just calling-up ugly memories from his 're-education' and potent fear from his past life. Imagine having lost your own family in your native country's genocide and taking-on the protection of one of the 're-educator's' children. You can see the grief on his face as he burns the child's clothing - we are left to imagine how he disposed of the child's body. I'd rather not....I also agree this epic film should be shown to every student in every high-school, history-class - but, how many are there left ? If you're interested in that era of our history, it is all on the 'net. It reminds me of the conflict in Iraq. Will we never learn?....make certain every citizen of Iraq sees this film. Yet, it may only be a situation they know very well.Because there WERE Oscars awarded, few of the commentators realize 'The Killing Fields' is a British release. That's unimportant, in the overall view of the film - the message of this shocking movie is there should be no more of these atrocities - can't we just get along ? Watch this film, it will depressively inspire you to work for freedom.....worldwide.....",10,1,3,8 June 2006
Judgment at Nuremberg," ..an absolutely flawless film..
","If there is a 'spoiler' in these comments, certainly it is intended by my statement that this movie has received no justice, although it was its theme. Perhaps the most important statement in the entirety of the film was presented at its end, when viewers were informed that NONE of those defendants who were convicted by U S Tribunals as Nazi criminals was still incarcerated at the the time the film was released.This only proves that what is justice for one period of time does not remain justice for future periods of time. One only needs to ponder upon The U S Supreme Court's decisions of the past decade. The Court's position has become the most political body of jurists since its inception. Jurists at this elevation should never be concerned with politics of any nature - it should rule ultimately and solely from The U S Constitution, not at the favor of a president. That august document has been twisted and misinterpreted to render judgments to favor the few, while leaving the majority without proper due cause.Spencer Tracy (the chief tribunal in 'Judgment at Nuremberg') delivered a monologue in which the ultimate truth is stated - no one is above the law and must suffer the consequences of his guilt......an award-winner role if there ever were one. Yet, how do you determine his performance as being a notch beneath the stunning performance of Maximillian Schell who rightfully won it, or the mesmerizing performance of Montgomery Cliff, or the against-his-character of Burt Lancaster, or the wrenching performance of Judy Garland. ALL of the main characters in this movie should have been nominated. I don't even remember what other films were nominated in l961, or what they were about, but they certainly must have been blockbusters - or the winner must have been by a popularity contest with the academy voters. As we know, they are not always right.'Judgment at Nuremberg' was robbed - the only nomination it couldn't have won was for costuming. Oh, it looked right - there just wasn't the need for extravagant costumes. Costuming, make-up, lighting, special effects, music certainly add to a film's impact: however, serious film-plays should be judged just as legitimate theater-productions are, by its impact of the actors' performances. The acting by every cast-member of 'Judgment' was flawless and portrayed every human emotion we know of. Just as prominent members of the motion-picture industry who were by-passed in the year they were nominated - or were never were nominated - but are given 'life-time'-awards years later, there needs to be an award for movies that SHOULD have won, but did not. This film should be a part of every history-class in every school - but, how many schools' itineraries, today, include a class on history? Please read some of these other commentaries on 'Judgment at Nuremberg' to get the full information about the film. To see how movies which were made during a golden age of movie-making, you must view this film. It will stay in your memory for ever - you should own a VHS or DVD version of it. This is one of those 20-out-of-10 performances.",10,1,2,6 May 2006
Apocalypse Now," ..'horror has a face'..
","I saw 'Apocalypse Now' three-days-in-a-row when it was originally released in what I thought was one of the greatest theaters ever - The Dome in Hollywood. Although it was scheduled for demolition (which actually began), public outpouring saved it. It's saved for major releases, but you can hardly get in. There is 'no seating' once the reels have begun to roll.Those early experiences were dazzling to me - I knew immediately this was going to be a classic film which provoked a myriad of opinions in every person who saw it. I suspectnone of us truly understand the layers of human frailty and brutality Coppola was trying to present. His great successes with 'The Godfather' series made it possible and viable for him to eventually become the film's producer. I don't think anyone else could have done it more brilliantly. While it nearly drove him mad, all of the problems on-set made the movie a much deeper masterpiece. Those who attempt to analyze it, to show us they know the real rationale, are wasting their time - who cares? Younger generations cannot perceive we old ones just could be a lot more sophisticated than is generally thought. The one truth is: '...the war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns who were gonna end-up giving the whole circus away' (Willard) sounds like an adept explanation of our present, nation-building involvement. Dangerous....I can attest that all of the cast for 'Apocalypse Now Redux' must have been frightfully traumatized by the months of shooting this film required. I made a film with Frederic Forest (Chef) shortly after it was completed; he was ready for the looney-bin. 'Trivia' - did you bother to read it? - states Martin Sheen's heart-attack was suppressed news. Brando's shenanigans, for which he's famous, and his unpreparedness for his role truly must have shocked the entire crew - but, his brilliance in his short role is stellar and proves his acting ability is sheer genius. Who else could have done it ? The pictures in the early part of the movie, to depict him when he was able-bodied and thin, were taken from 'Reflection in a Golden Eye'. Heck, we all knew he was obese and penniless - how can that matter? Just his name made us want to run to the theater.Only one review I read suggested that some of the actual fighters in Vietnam should have been consulted; so far as I've read, NOT ONE PERSON indicated they were in that war. Yet, those troops were drafted and did their 'tour', but were looked-upon as being morally dead when they returned home. 'Kill upon command' equals moral zombie. as 'Kurtz' scribbled, 'drop the bomb - annihilate them all', I became vengeful after 9/11 and am still struggling to understand that emotion, in full realization every nation possessing atomic weapons would fire-them-off, fearing they'd be next. That's our next 'apocalypse'.......The reviews of 'Apocalypse Now Redux' (and the original) are so intelligently written - every person has been drawn into this epic. Those who didn't like any version of it I can't defend. I, too, was immediately a part of the movie from the first sound to the last, in every frame - I watched it again last night and am still emotionally drained. I was on that boat; I was traveling up that river; I was amazed the Playboy gals were on that stage; I was shocked when they killed all the people on the river-boat; I was appalled by the sex-scenes with the Playboy gals; I was undone with each killing of the crew (Albert Hall was great), I saw all of the hallucinations from the drugs, and I'm a teetotaler (wow! for Sam Bottoms!) which allowed the real troops to survive the horror; I understood why the Frenchmen insisted on staying on their plantation and siding with the VCs; I felt the fear of the journey as they neared 'Kurtz's' compound; I could feel his craze and why the photographer thought he was a genius; I recognized the zombie-like stance of the Cambodians; I was terrified when 'Willard' first met 'Kurtz'; I bit my tongue when 'Chef's' head was thrown onto 'Willard's' lap; I knew 'Kurtz' kept 'Willard' alive because he needed the assassination; I picked-up that 'Lance' was accepted by the Cambodians, freak-like; I knew the assassination was coming when 'Willard' emerged from the river; I was certain 'Kurtz' was only waiting; I was terrified after the killing; I expected to be torn limb-by-limb afterward; I rejoiced when 'Lance' and 'Willard' began their journey down the river; I am glad none of us know what really happened, later.To those few who wondered if the killing of the water-buffalo caused an uproar, I had read soon after the film's release it was a religious celebration for the local Filipinos - Coppola's cameras just happened to be rolling. What a piece of drama that fit right into the plot.All of those actors who were offered the role of 'Willard' surely must realize they screwed-up by refusing it - or, perhaps they knew they didn't have the stamina nor acting-ability to do it. For those who loved Martin Sheen's narration, he didn't do it: it was his brother, Joe Estevez.Here is another masterpiece from the 1970s - I see now I must buy the DVD. As one other 'user' did, I thank EVERYONE who had any part in its coming to the screen - bravo! for the cinematography and sound-track. This film should be shown to every near-adult student - it's nothing they're not familiar with, including sex and violence. Indeed, I'll watch it many times again and revel in its grandeur, grieving that we do not seem to be able to shake-off our animalistic brutality toward people we do not understand - praying fervently we can overcome....",10,2,2,30 July 2006
Jarhead," ..did I really see this film?...is this a 'spoiler'...
","I don't know if I'm writing a 'spoiler' or not. I certainly hope not, because I've recently found IMDb and want to comment on many GREAT movies I've experienced. My strongest impression is that, with SO MANY pages of comments, they are all made by young males.....definitely YOUNG, because they type without 'capitals'. Although I've seen - and loved - all the other war-movies mentioned in these comments, I suppose I am too old-fashioned to be able to enjoy a movie that has no story..... no matter what the subject is. My worst impression is we are in the business of turning very innocent, young males into robots - the danger will not be realized until many years after the 'marines' have matured. Gee, I hope we get out of that business of ruining young lives before they even have the chance to discover it. This film showed me nothing to like. If that's how the military really acts, then I don't need to know about it.....the film 'The War at Home' illustrates this graphically.Another thing I'd like to do: interview those guys who think it's so great to be that macho and who ranted about how strong Jake G played his role, and then ask them their opinion of him after 'Brokeback Mountain'. If 'jarhead' is their nick-names, they deserve it.....Boo !",1,2,8,2 May 2006
Ocean's Eleven," ..an old fart watching youngsters' films...
","....again, pages and pages of absolutely banal comments. Know what? I enjoyed watching the film, but enjoyed reading the commentaries more !! ...and I didn't see the original, so can't comment on that.....but, I've performed in shows in Vegas and am fairly familiar with the security-systems they use. This film was like a 'kiddies' version of 'Casino'.ALL of the cast were believable and each showed good acting, with the simple script they were given - what a picnic for Matt !! He could've done this role asleep. THAT was Elliott Gould ???? If that's the actor I'm thinking of, he had the best role in the whole film. The handsome George Clooney was the handsome George Clooney, as always.....no acting involved. Brad Pitt promised a good role in the beginning, but what did he have to work with? Julia Roberts was a waste, but isn't she usually? The rest of the actors did their jobs well and provided an old fart with good entertainment for an evening, as most posters commented. I'm still trying to understand all that high-tech stuff.....",4,1,2,3 May 2006
Legends of the Fall," ..what an epic..
","'Legends of the Fall' is not a movie for ordinary entertainment. This film takes total involvement, otherwise you're wasting your time. There are several comments posted here which are truly poetic - I just want to agree with them, absolutely - I can't fathom anyone not liking this film.Yes, Edward Zwick got all of the magic from Susan Shilliday's script and directed an epic movie in every category. Hard to believe the film got nearly 17,000 votes and it didn't make it to a 9 ? Maybe folk don't recognize epics anymore? No doubt the editor had a ball with such magnificent cinematography and seamless filming. I found every role acted to the fullest. When I saw 'Legends' the first time, the only scenes I could have done without were all those weird places Tristan went to - I saw no reason for them. Tonight (10/21/06), I finally heard 'One Stab' (Gordon Tootoosis) explain how animal and human blood combine, making the human more animalistic. That explains why 'Tristan' (Brad Pitt) could not kill the bear. 'Tristan's' demons certainly showed he 'fell from innocence' and how his wildness effected every member of that family. Pitt's acting is stellar. One commentary said a scene in a loonie-bin was cut - good ! I just watched this movie - fifth time - and am laughing at myself. I thought Pitt's character was named 'Christian'. 'Col. Ludlow' (Anthony Hopkins) had to dig deep for that one ! Now I'm wondering who was 'Isolde'....could have been either of the ladies who loved him. Julia Ormand (Sussanah Ludlow) and Karina Lombard (Isabel Ludlow) were perfect in their roles, as was the entire cast. Wow! for Hopkins.Director Zwick surely made all of the characters come alive - the Native American chants were beautiful and so appropriate. Bravo! 'One Stab' !This movie shows you can live in paradise without finding happiness in many ways. Give us some more like this one - although there was a great deal of real-life violence in 'Legends', it was necessary to depict the folly of human-beings. shoot-em-ups....",10,0,1,10 May 2006
Saving Private Ryan," ..pretty near perfect..
","This film is a heartbreaker, because 53,000,000 men died - all over the world - to prevent that deadly stunning Omaha Beach battle. Yet, came The Korean War; the attempted invasion of Cuba; The Vietnamese War; The Gulf War; The Somalian War (we turned-tail and ran); that mess in Afghanistan (which has never been conquered); and now the fiasco in Iraq, the cradle of civilization as we know it. There's a tale making the rounds that our president was upset because 'they tried to shoot my Daddy', he wanted to get Sadam. Hmmmm.....how many times do you think we've tried to do that? Doesn't assassination go with leadership?'Saving Private Ryan' should have been a graphic lesson that all wars are useless bravado AND 'hell'- except for those who win ! - because it is inhumane for one sovereign country to attempt to dictate to another. An anonymous commentator wrote 'let's hope that this is the last war.' Have they been living in a vacuum for a couple of generations, or perhaps too young to have experienced the horror of wartime? Perhaps WW 2 was supposed to be 'the war to end all wars,' but that completely dismisses man's inhumanity toward man. Some races just don't like other races, as we are seeing in Iraq - and they all are from the same race ! If you can read between the lines of the headlines today, the next war will be over the lack of water or a specific religion.....or some belligerents idiot will launch an atomic weapon that will destroy life as we know it. If that is going to happen, please let me know when so I can get right under it.No one has mentioned watching 'Into the Breach', which depicts the basic training-period the actors were forced to go through.....just like regular 'grunts'. One of the actors stated he would not do that again. All of them hated it, but all of their roles were greater for having experienced it.'Saving Private Ryan' is near perfect in all ways, acting through direction through casting through cinematography through realism. My opinion is that Tom Hanks underplayed his role to make a point that ordinary men usually get the biggest responsibility in battle. It's 'the grunts' who do the fighting - the bigwigs are behind in a safe area: 'Blackhawk Down' serves as a perfect example. Sizemore WAS the seasoned warrior, and played his role superbly. Barry Pepper (in an entirely different role than in 'The Green Mile') gave us a believable soldier who took his fighting seriously, but asserting 'The Lord in My Shepherd'. Masterful. Matt Damon was brilliant, as he is in all of his roles; his statement 'these are the only brothers I have left' was a natural turning to those who had become his brothers. 'Upham' made me cry, because I understood his cowardice - he didn't try to hide it - it was palpable. Quite frankly, I didn't recognize Ted Danson, quite a star in his day, in the film. Spielberg knew what he was doing, and did it.The most specific demonstration in this movie is how different the fighters in 'Saving Private Ryan' are from modern-day fighters: 'Jarhead' will show you that. Recruiting our youngest men to become killers is criminal - except, some of them have no other route to make their way in our world.We needed this movie - to remind us that we are on the way to a collision with the rest of the world. Brits decried they were not part of this battle - they were up at another beach, being killed just as brutally. All of the countries involved made the same sacrifice. Our Memorial Day honors all of those who lost their lives for freedom. If we are looking for movies to merely demonstrate what a great sound-system we have, that's pitiful.Until another ones comes along, 'Saving Private Ryan' IS the best war-picture we've had - everyone should see it.",10,1,2,31 May 2006
The Pianist," ..the tagline says it all...
","'The Pianist' is a movie which plays upon all of your emotions, as it should. Unless you had seen rushes at the theater or on TV (I hadn't), one would expect it to be primarily about classical music. It did get my attention because of its director, Roman Polanski; I've always enjoyed his films. Of course, that he can't come to this country to collect awards he wins also heightened expectations for the film. I was not familiar with a single member of the movie's cast. That bothered only because I didn't know who was doing what - I recognized Adrien Brody (Szpilman)from the ads in THE LOS ANGELES TIMES. He was in every scene; after all, it was his story. Not being familiar with the other actors-actresses certainly didn't effect my total enjoyment of it.The first view of Adrien Brody at the piano kinda bothered me. I have never seen such emotionless piano-playing; I was a piano-student, concert-grade pianist. Even in those days - when it was REALLY difficult to break-into the classical music-field because there was no competitive programs to give you a boost - I don't buy all those stone-faced guys, great ones all, who played without the tiniest smile or pained expression. Were they robots? Neither do I think the overly-impassioned banging of today's pianists is natural, arms flailing and hair flying. Of course, unless a pianist doesn't do some of that, it's difficult for the audience in the last row of the balcony to determine if the pianist is just earning his breakfast, or really enjoying his music. It's kinda ludicrous for a pianist to get all worked-up over most Polish music, even Chopin's. BUT, I defy a pianist to play the really difficult music of Rachmaninov and not show one emotion over the energy it takes to keep pain-racked arms and hands working together or independently of one another - plus, the absolute fear you are not going to remember what comes next.'The Pianist' was Roman Polansky's very best directing. Every scene was perfect and every actor/actress gave wonderful performances. The development of characters, to show the repressive torture all endured, even BEFORE the death-camps, looked absolutely real. The degradation they suffered just to survive was graphically clear. Also graphic were the roles of indifference - perhaps out of fear for themselves ? - most of the 'Polish' citizens projected. No different from 'The Diary of Anne Frank.' Also in this movie, the compassion of the few whom this movie depicted to put themselves in harm's way to help others, was a powerful message.Let's face it - today's people, especially Americans - would not have made it through the years of hiding and deprivation the citizens of all European countries were forced to endure. Every descent from one degradation to the next was heart-wrenching, and we were only following the misery of one family. We could watch, just across the street, helpless people thrown into them, shot-dead and then run-over by trucks?....set on fire?...shot for no reason at all? We could be locked-up in a couple of rooms for months-on-end without going stir-crazy? Not on your life - After all of his misfortune, the pianist gave his greatest performance for the Nazi officer; it was brilliant - not only for the pianist, but for the untold truth (read guilt) and ecstasy on the officer's face. In that scene, Mr. Brody was a pianist; it saved his life - in his concert, post-war, to show him at the piano, then watching a totally different pair of hands blithely doing the work, was simply contrived. The artist may have been a prominent Polish pianist, but I don't think Szpilman would have approved.You want drama - this movie gives it. We end-up where we began, in the radio-station. You should own it to be reminded that being extraordinary does not necessarily mean you will be treated that way - Bravo to all !10/20/06 - Came back to this great movie tonight. I noticed two 'goofs': when the family is selling the piano, the brother slams the lid to the keyboard shut. Two seconds later when the buyer is looking at it, it's open. When 'the pianist' is playing for the German officer, there is nothing on the piano but 'the can'; the very next shot has the officer's coat and hat on the piano. He had none when he stood in the door of the kitchen........",10,0,2,9 May 2006
Dog Day Afternoon," ..Sonny should have gone to Mom..
","This movie is difficult to review, because the list of actors-actresses don't tell you who played whom. The atmosphere inside the bank was definitely controlled by the group of ladies who were being held hostage. At the beginning of the robbery, Pacino (Sonny) was all macho to convince the hostages he was serious; they were terrified. Farther along into the robbery, the ladies could see by 'Sonny's' concern for their safety, and became almost relaxed. His early release of the bank-guard and his immediate calling for a doctor to treat the manager - plus the pizzas! - let them see beneath his blustery.'Sal,' on the other hand, was sinister but could not have been a Vietnam-veteran, because his role originally was written for an 18-year-old. So, we are left to decide for ourselves how he became so sinister so young in life. I prefer to accept he was older and would kill without remorse. Cazale portrayed that characteristic superbly, although we are left to wonder at his intelligence, just the 'enforcer' to back-up 'Sonny'? Another fact from 'trivia' tells us that the real robbers got $213,000, quite a nice haul for that period. Frank Pierson's award-winning Oscar heightened the entire disaster of the robbery, telling us there was only $1100.00 in the vault - it did not mention it was a Chase bank. Again we are left to decide for ourselves 'and it is all true' really is, OR not. I prefer to stick to the script.........except to disbelieve that the character 'Leon' was a woman trapped in the body of a man. Nah! 'Leon' was too handsome, although he did come-across as a trifle sissified. Other 'users' say this was his first major role; great acting, but I don't remember any other role he played. Maybe I'm too old. 'Trivia' also tells us that the telephone-conversation between 'Sonny' and 'Leon' was not scripted, as many other scenes were not......purely improvised. To me, THAT would have been the best scene in the entire film, not even considering how realistic and believable the synergy between the two characters was. Wonder what Pierson thought about that?Younger reviewers often want to believe that not much was happening during the '70s. They weren't around. Surprise ! sex-change operations were old hat by then, the best being performed at universities many years before. Nothing really controversial in that theme. Not everyone could just walk-up and have the operation done. They had to live in female clothing for one year pre-surgery and pass many psychic therapies. How ironic 'Sonny' decided to head for Algeria - that's where American men were mutilated in the first operations........'Leon' would have felt right at home. So, Young-uns, do a little research before making serious-sounding statements. I knew several 'trans-gendered' people post-surgery long before the '70s.......'Sonny's' character would lead us to think of him as being Italian, not Polish. Because of Pacino's role in 'The Godfather' movies, I repeat from other reviews that The Mafia were homosexual, too - not too many movies about them bring that out. In the film, 'Sonny' says 'you gotta have a little fun in life', after the ladies in the bank hear the TV-reporter say 'two homosexuals' - which would leave us to believe all this gay-life wasn't too unusual to him. When the NY detective sees 'Leon', he registers a little surprise, then goes-on to handle the situation with brilliance - bravo! for Durning. NO New York detective is going to be surprised when a little homosexuality comes into play.I'm not really a fan of 'The Godfather' films, so I rate this role by Pacino as one of his best. 'Scarface' was a melodrama, to me - way over the top. 'Dog Day Afternoon' - in all of its unlikeliness - could have happened just as it was scripted. Every one of the actors-actresses was stellar. The crowds outside in the street were a big contribution to the excitement of the film. The FBI-guys were right-on - I am left to wonder why they were determined to 'take care of Sal' - what had he done but robbed a bank? No investigation of the shooter ?The will-writing scene was particularly moving. Perhaps that was 'Sonny's' first inkling for the dance to get into the bus, all the parade to the airport, the jet - everything - was just another situation to go wrong. Not one of the reviewers mentioned that he did not spend a time long in prison, and his name has not surfaced again, that I know of. It's difficult to not sympathize with the villains of this movie, because they actually did nothing wrong, but attempt to rob the bank. Some bank-robbers would have been so taken-aback to discover the vault empty, they may have mowed everyone down out of anger.This story gives us much insight into how individuals react to unpleasant incidents, but get to take part in a story for the grandkids.......let's face it, it takes an extra-ordinarily moral person not to be tempted to become wealthy by robbing banks, otherwise there wouldn't be so many dangerous Fridays in the banking-business. I'll stay poor from fear and weakness.......'Dog Day Afternoon' gave me another reason to live less dangerously. This is a 10-out-of-ten all around......even without a musical score",10,4,7,7 July 2006
Meet Joe Black," MJB - sooner or later everyone does
","In my case, it was 'later'. In my harried work-every-day years - so many of them ! - I had never heard of this movie. Had I not been discussing movies I had recently purchased with a postal clerk, in an office I had used for thirty-five of those years,I would never have discovered it: she told me about it, without giving one hint of its content. I am one of those persons who can be told the entire plot without it becoming a spoiler for me. It was the look on her face when she told me, 'I really liked it,' that gave me the intuition it was something special. She had seen it on cable-TV; I bought it on eBay, without hesitation. A movie-a-night is my passion, so I watched it the very day it came to me. I wasn't fifteen minutes into it when I became aware it WAS something special. I'm not certain I understood too much about it after my first viewing: I may have seen 'Death Takes a Holiday', but I don't remember having seen it. I'm certainly old enough to have seen the original release.I have viewed it several times, the last half of it only minutes ago. I have read approximately half of the fifty-five pages of commentaries posted here. I read so few unfavorable ones, which I dismissed without a second thought. I agree with every favorable comment - as varied as they are, each expressing differently their passion for the film - and have learned so much I wasn't sure I understood about the story, from those comments. I totally agree it was made with extreme dedication by everyone who took part in bringing it to an audience starved for classic movie-making.The combination of Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani - who give their entire souls to this script - is dynamite, plus sumptuous scenery full of very talented people who make this film the masterpiece it is. How gratifying it is to read the glowing comments written by people who know, or recognize, what classic movies are about. Many of the piano-sketches are of a diabolic nature, but played with sweetness.It needs the full three hours of its length to let love-impossible-love flower. We can only soulfully hope its message is trumpeted around the world, that even The Angel of Death cannot overcome the ultimately consuming power of true love. I am so happy to share the mesmerizing splendor of this unforgettable film. Our love for it will keep it alive.",10,8,13,3 May 2006
Million Dollar Baby," ..a real winner...
","I'm caught again without knowing anything about this great film. I had no idea what it was about, but pleasantly surprised that it presents a documentary on a topic I knew/and/know very little about: women's boxing league. So many great reviews have been posted here, there is little else to write.The entire film is done with perfection: the dark lighting of the gym makes the incidents that happens in it believable; it is the reflection of the misery most of the characters bring to it. I don't agree with some reviewers who say the story lagged and was incomplete: the script was gut-wrenching, because it lead one to believe 'Maggie' )Hillary Swank) is going to win her life-long dream. 'Frank' (Clint Eastwppd) has begun to believe he has won redemption for whatever he has done to cause all those letters to be returned. 'Scrap-Iron' is content to live in a place where he began a journey to a lost title, but holds no bitterness against the man who could have done more for him to win his victory. 'Maggie' is relentless, and successful, to have 'Frank' manage and train her - the other characters are the types of people you'd expect to find in the gym. Bullies taunting a totally inept boy who also dreams of becoming a title-holder; 'Scrap-Iron's' defense of him brings him complete peace with the realization he is in the right place. 'Billie, the Blue Bear's' resentment (and realization she has met her match) brutally illegal attack on 'Maggie' is completely unexpected (but believable), and provides the reason for 'Frank' to do 'the right thing' and move-on. 'Scrap-Iron's' realization that he must keep the gym operating, for 'Frank's return, solved that whole problem, and brought viewers such relief that 'Maggie' almost accomplished her dream - and left her misery in a hard-won peace.Script, directing and casting couldn't have been better. Every actor/actress was brilliant. Although it brought me to a point to think about incidents of pain and happiness in my own life, it wasn't with more pain......that's just what happened. I would recommend this film to everyone, because it has a blueprint of what life is about. I'll watch it again......",10,2,4,9 March 2011
The Last Emperor," ..The warlords of China..
","To say that Bernardo Bertolucci aptly over-saw the creation of a masterpiece on an era of history that would definitely change the relationship of nations throughout history, forever, is putting it mildly. That he did it with such artistically factual film-making is to say his success was nearly miraculous. 'Never can be made again' is one of many 'users' favorite descriptions of many films. You may conclude that would be a quite accurate statement about 'The Last Emperor', especially for American film-making......they had nothing to do with it.To amass such a huge cast today would put many nations into immediate bankruptcy, much less movie-producers. Every scene is detailed to perfection; the reign of the last emperor of China wasn't that long ago, so there were unlimited sources for research. That they were made available - and especially shooting on location in The Forbidden City - with the approval of the communist government of Peking in the 1980s is even more miraculous. After centuries of the Qing emperors' reigns, for this gigantic nation to change its manner of governing boggles the mind. One would assume China would just as soon deny that one year of its history, much as Japan is only beginning to admit its Asian atrocities.As we have seen a poverty-stricken nation become a world-power, it's frightening to realize it is an ON-GOING epic - the USA has fought two major wars against China, without putting one soldier on its soil: The Vietnam War and The Korean War, not taking into consideration the countless insurgencies to contain this giant, a major ally during The Second World War. Keep tuned, folk - the drama continues.......I wonder if this period of history is being taught in our schools. It certainly would help students to understand that era more easily just by showing 'The Last Emperor' to every class, inviting their parents also to attend for a little briefing. There must be millions who had/have no idea these incidences were happening and what catastrophic results that brief era could have hidden in the wings. The Giant is awakening, already an atomic power, with some of the world's greatest cities. 'Made in China' is no longer a derision - we have seen with our own eyes how intelligent its peasants have always been; the metamorphosis into a nation which does pretty-much as it pleases was possible only because the peasants - until today - were dispensable.Again we are shown what epics were filmed during the 1970s-80s - there are no modern-day movies that can compare to the richness of this film. The luxury therein will never be matched; it is almost unbelievable to realize Chinese royalty and its wealthy citizens lived every day of their lives with such pomp, up to modern-day history.All of the actors who portrayed the emperor were stellar - the closing of the crimson gates at The Forbidden City and at the Japanese palace in Manchuria left no doubt this unfortunate creature was going nowhere but where other powers forced him to go. John Lone was truly robbed of an Oscar. His role clearly depicted the emperor's vulnerabilities to have no power to conduct his own destiny. As a puppet-emperor, he was totally controlled by the Japanese, then subjugated to communist cruelties in Russia, and then brain-washed into the free-but-pitiful citizen he became in his later life. John Lone's acting definitely gave us the character of totalitarian-with-compassion Pu Yi was.Joan Chen and 'the second wife' were brilliant, as was the 'spy' who undid their lives. Peter O'Toole, in my opinion, was barely convincing in his role. ALL of the supporting actors/actresses were totally convincing; just the management of such masses of people is astounding. There is so much to see and learn in this movie, I cannot imagine anyone not being caught-up in it. Mark Peploe's script was perfect, the way every script should be. The panoramic cinematography a feast for the eyes - the costuming and choreography and score mesmerizing. I wondered how many people realized, during the early scenes in The Forbidden City, those gigantic headdresses were actually the ladies' hair !!!I sincerely hope there are many other films of this caliber I have not yet seen - would make no difference where they were made. The scope of this movie demands a rating of 15-to-10.",10,4,6,22 July 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," ..loved it before I heard it was a masterpiece...
","Like so many, I find 'Once Upon a Time in America' to be about as perfect - in ALL respects - as a movie can be. EVERY actor/actress was superb....the story so convincing and true-to-life......the costuming so authentic.....the score so beautiful......each scene so well-developed...every character fully developed, etc., etc., etc., etc...BUT - I had to read many comments here to confirm that I wasn't the only one who truly loved it. I had NO IDEA it had been chopped and there were other footages of film unreleased. I have the 4-hour VHS version and wondered if TCM would show it all at one time. Last weekend and this coming weekend, it is divided for two showings. I had already watched it several times, so decided that I would pay very close attention to the details TCM presented. Unfotunately, I did not get good reception on TV although I have satellite (too far away from the receiver; I have another TV for watching VHS and DVD), so I cut immediately to my VHS. I now realize that TCM IS showing the uncut version, even with scenes that are not in my VHS. For instance, in the first scene when the girl is shot, she is shot twice, not once. When the hoodlums are beating-up on 'Fat Moe' (fabulous character played by Larry Papp), they put a gun in his mouth to get him to tell where 'Noodles' (DeNiro) is hiding....that's not in the VHS....and on-and-on. Someday, I'll get the DVD, but I don't always like them. The VHS is so moody in its colors.Read some of the other user's comments to get the full story if you've missed this great film.....I'm not saying a thing about the story. I've personally known gangsters and they are portrayed authentically in 'Once Upon a Time in America' - if you think they don't still exist, you're uninformed. They are a different breed than the 'gangstas' who roam our streets today.I am terribly confused about the running-length of this movie....nearly every comment has a different time. I don't have ANY trouble with long movies....yes, I was confused the first time I saw it, but it's beauty drew me right back to it - you have to really get involved in this story, beautifully directed by Leone with crystalline cinematography. I suspect I'll watch the last half again on TCM this Saturday, good reception or not.'Best' is a personal decision: I stand steadfastly with those who think this movie is one of the most moving films ever made. Bravo! to all involved - and I also agree with another 'user' who rates it as 100-to-10.......Other 'ganster'-films do not portray the hoods as real people - they were and are.....I've been watching them since silent-film days. Better than 'Godfather' ?.,....by a mile !! Every adult should watch this movie, even if only to discover they don't like it.",10,4,10,26 July 2007
Chariots of Fire," ..a simple story that glorifies life..
","So many wonderful comments have been written about 'Chariots of Fire,' there is little else to add. What a study of life it is in an era when it was important to be true to one's self ! People living in that period of time simply don't exist anymore, in any country. If I knew of one, I'd more there. To conform to a gentler society and have respect for other humans is an admirable quality - we are so selfishly indulging ourselves today (2007), we hardly notice how uncaring we are.As many have written, director Hugh Hudson and screen-writer Colin Welland have produced a film which will be inspiring for an eternity. What a shock that schlock ('Reds') and cartoon-like action ('Raiders') rightfully lost-out to a gentle story of personal pride in one's own actions and beliefs.....'stay the course' certainly had a different meaning in that age. I know from personal experience - I gave-up my life's dream because I did not have the determination to struggle through the difficult times to reach the ultimate happiness of success. However, I've grown from that mistaken decision: it forced me to see myself as perhaps others would, if they knew the story.The fact that Eric Lidell returned to China to take-up his interrupted mission, and died because of his courage and desire to serve his God, is edifying enough. Doing something for the sheer joy of doing it is seldom seen today. Every factor of this movie is inspiring - those who do not gain peace and a desire to do better, after watching 'Chariots of Fire', do not know enough to accept life as it is given.....pure at its beginning and later sullied by imperfection and selfishness.I saw it tonight (5/27/07) on TCM, although I had earlier decided that I would not, I am so pleased there was nothing else on TV worthy of watching. I have found peace in such a gorgeously photographed film. We need more of these; I recommend it to all......all those who participated in bringing it to the screen should be proud. I rate it as a 20 -",10,2,5,27 May 2007
The Da Vinci Code," .saw it twice, need to see it again..
","I've read 28-of-89 pages of comments posted here. I totally agree the book AND THE MOVIE are FICTIONAL. The film (directed by Ron Howard, scripted by Akiva Goldman) is very educationally entertaining, if you don't know too much about what the factual story is. Few users seem to know this; they did no research about the 'facts' presented by author Dan Brown. One user wrote, 'Dan Brown believes the documentation is fact; Ron Howard does not'.Dumb me, I had no idea 'The Da Vinci Code' was causing such an uproar when the book was published (work-schedule). Therefore, IF I knew the book were being made into a film - and people all over the world were protesting it - I don't remember. I learned of it from a conversation I had with a fellow-worker.I am a Christian and totally believe in the scriptures of The New Testament, and the holiness of Jesus. That is called 'faith'.There is nothing to convince me otherwise. 'Jesus of Nazareth' is my favorite movie of all time; it too, was not chronologically faithful to The New Testament. The difference between 'Code' and 'Nazareth' is, 'Code' was filmed to be seen in a single viewing - 'Nazareth' was a multi-series for British TV. Therefore, there was no concern about wasting time for character-development, nor re-arranging and discarding parts of the book's plot.I feel Ron Howard should have made the movie much longer - in order to explain all the mysteries of the story presented through dialog - with an intermission to let the audience discuss what they had seen in the first half, so the second half would demand more attention and deep thought.All of the actors/actresses were excellent in their roles, with the exception of diction; with the exception of 'Silas' (Paul Bettany); 'Sir Leigh Teabing' (Ian McKellan); and 'Sister Sandrine' (Marie-Francoise Audollent), who were stellar in their roles. Although the actors who played the French police may be big stars, their elocution left something to be desired. That includes Tom Hanks ('Robert Langdon') and Audrey Tautou ('Sophie Neveu'). Movies depend upon dialog to tell the story, Ron Howard was just a bit careless not to be certain every word would be audible and understood.'The Da Vinci Code' is a griping, fast-moving film, with the exception of character-development. People appeared instantaneously without any explanation of their importance to the story, yet we see archbishops playing pool. I found it ironic that 'the last survivor (on Earth) of Jesus' bloodline' would be a police-woman, also one attempting to break the code.....also the grand-daughter of the curator of le Louvre.......he just happened to know the entire secret and the whereabouts of 'The Holy Grail'. How convenient. I also found it a stretch for 'Sauniere' (Jean-Pierre Marielle) to painfully disfigure himself as he was dying, and to leave messages around his body to solve his murder and protect the resting-place of 'The Grail'. However, that made for great sleuthing for the rest of the cast, down to an archbishop of The Catholic Church.A little research would have shown OPUS DEI ('God's Work') was not a secret faction of the church exclusively for bigwigs - it includes many ordinary people, all around the world, who are STILL radical with their self-flagellation, some of them even willing to be crucified to show their love of Jesus. They hear 'take-up your cross and follow me' seriously. Paul Bettany's character exemplified that desire passionately, and his role made the entire movie meaningful.None of the comments presented on IMDb.com mentioned that popes were not always religious people. 'The Vatican' (the nation of 'The Holy See') is a tiny, independent nation ruled autocratically by The Pope. He is not sent down from Heaven to be Jesus' vicar on Earth (Simon Peter), as some believe The Dali Lama is a divine being. The Pope is elected by other very ambitious, political archbishops. History certainly documents how they used the kings and queens of Europe to do their dirty work, to control the world....The Holy Roman Empire: the de Medicis, the Borgias? The Knights Exmplar were (and still may be) factual. In our present day, there is much debate whether Pope Pius XII connived with Hitler and Mussolini to save The Vatican, although he saved many Jews.I truly enjoyed 'The Da Vinci Code,' and am anxious to view the DVD......a director's cut, I hope. Whether any of Da Vinci's paintings had hidden clues doesn't matter much to me. One user wrote, 'Mona Lisa smiles because she knows The Holy Grail is missing and Jesus is still a bachelor.' Another, 'Fear men who can justify doing evil in God's name.' Sounds like 'Aringarosa' and 'Silas' ? - does to me ! The action-scenes and the cathedrals in all those gorgeous places made-up for the few holes in the plot. I didn't find anything to laugh-at; this is a serious drama about a serious theory. As a Christian, I don't believe much of it. As for His marriage to Mary Magdalene, 'google: 'The Bloodline of The Holy Grail''.He was not divine ? Please......I did far too much research on subjects of which I am familiar. I found 'The Gospel of Mary' and read it. Now, I hope my next viewing of 'Code' will be one for pure enjoyment and enrichment, WITHOUT commercials. I recommend this film for all, Christian or of any other religion. The theory that all religions have one god - Jesus and The Holy Spirit - is widely accepted. A couple of hours to lose oneself in a fascinating tale for the opportunity to further understand a topic about which one may not know too much, surely is not wasted time. I disagree with all of those who think this movie will not become a classic - it is, already. Bravo to all who had any part in its production.",10,0,1,11 November 2008
Enemy at the Gates," ..good film about war for an old fogey..
","..it didn't matter to me that everyone spoke English - after all, it WAS directed at an English-speaking audience ! Thank heavens I didn't need to strain to understand what folk were saying - if you want realism in speech, then get a version that is in the native tongues.I do feel empathy for the several reviews I read which were written by people who were native Russians. I'm sure they saw it through different eyes than Americans did. My response to their anger is just be glad you're in the USA - just think of how many films you may have seen 'at home' that painted Americans as devils, yet we're not writing to tell you you're wrong. Welcome to the USA, but would you please send your 'Mafia' home - we have enough of our own.Again, so many reviews written by very young 'users', who have only the movies to show them what war is. It was 2001, folk: pre-Iraq. Although we got all torn-up about 9/11 and our leaders made the wrong decision about invading Iraq, just imagine a major, American city all busted-up like Stalingrad was. We had the comfort of grand theaters and our homes to watch safely. Those people were fighting the people right next door, not really knowing who was whom - some 'users' said how ridiculous it was to film enemy-snipers shooting one another in the department-store scene, but that was reality. Whatever space you were in, you had to keep yourself alive and keep the space, and KILL to get someone else's space. Made sense to me.....Jean-Jacques Annaud and Alain Godard got it all going right from the first scene. No one else noticed that once the train-doors were opened and the Russian soldiers saw the wreckage of Stalingrad, they were trying to get back on it? That's the first thing I noticed - I also got the message when the barges were crossing the river full of soldiers and the German planes came, overboard! with the Russian officers shooting them. That was not fiction - it happened wherever Russia sent its troops - die fighting, or die because you didn't fight. Stalin sent 2-mil soldiers just to fight at Stalingrad - many without weapons - Jude Law (Zaitsev) left the train without a rifle. Being an expert shot, I suspect he was looking right-hard to get one in his hands. When he did, it set the plot of the entire movie - Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) was soooooo lucky ! Knowing the Russian troops needed some propaganda to be 'pepped-up' from all the gore, he used what he saw firsthand.I thought the cinematography was brilliant and was repelled at the way the Russian soldiers were sent to the slaughter, but that's facts, folk. Bob Hoskins looked like Krushshev to me ! I also thought it was ironic that he did the big 'toast' to Stalin - although they were antagonists.......he had to do what it took to get the troops fighting. Yeah, I saw the reporter stuffing his bags with stolen food. Those 'users' who criticized the 'party-scene' between battles weren't thinking right - it was an escape, just like in 'Jarhead'. The same for the sex-scene (didn't enjoy it); get that many people together under great stress and sex is going to happen. I thought the Russian troops were lucky to have female fighters to have sex with......I also could have done without the intrusive score; sounded a lot like 'Gone with the Wind' to me.Yeah, I DID think Ed Harris (Konig) could've spiced-up his role with a touch of German accent - he truly looked the part. His calm demeanor throughout the movie was excellent - Prussian aristocrat, you could say. Yes, the view through both snipers' lenses were the best, but that's what the movie was about - huh? Eva Mattes was stellar in her under-playing of her role - hopeless, but ready to get-it-on again. The kid - Gabriel Thompson (Sacha) - TRULY needed some warmer clothes ! Russia had two great advantages for the 2nd WW - sub-zero weather, which greatly weakened the Germans during the battle for Moscow - and lots of male peasants to throw away. Without those, the war would have been much longer and more American soldiers would have died.After all these criticisms, I immensely enjoyed this film, because I briefly laughed at what I felt was a bit unbelievable, but got right back into the story. It's always 'the story' for me - accurate or not. The blood-and-guts totally convinced me the battle for this city was a nightmare I hopefully pray never happens again - but, it continues.....see the daily news about Baghdad, as 'Bergy from Baghdad' (March 2003) attests. War movies glorify bravery from one side, but there is much death for the other. Not one thing glamorous or entertaining about that. I recently wrote if I wanted to see explosions, I'd watch a film about war. I did - horrific as it was, 'Enemy at the Gates' is a winner that more people should see or watch again, just to catch-them-up on history. In this case, it wasn't just a movie - it was telling it like it was........and is. That makes it a 15-out-of-10 for me......I'm still wondering why Sacha had to die. Best actor in the whole thing.....",10,1,2,14 July 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," ..I really don't know what to say..
","I really tried to like this movie - thank heavens I saw it free !!! I thought the newspaper-ads were appealing; I didn't see trailers in theaters - the PR was good. I know nothing about Jolie, but can see why Julia Roberts wanted to have her lips pumped.Pitt has done some good films - 'Meet Joe Black' was excellent. I don't think any of the main actors in this movie watched the 'dailies', or the money was so good they didn't care, and the editor must have been holding his nose....all very slick and colorful, but was there a story ? Lots of other commentators didn't think so, either. I could have sworn I saw this flick before - was it a re-make ? Someone commented that Jolie had had lots of plastic-surgery - hmmmmm. She certainly looks like the modern girl, but I wouldn't say she's beautiful. I met Pitt face-to-face - very good-looking man. However, it's almost 'surgery' time for him if he's going to retain that 'pretty-boy' look.Several people commented it had almost the same plot as 'The War of the Roses' - not even close !! To compare 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' to this film is sacrilege. It is my opinion that younger people get so caught-up in 'stars'' personal lives from the pulp mags, they convince themselves ALL their films are good, no matter what.I wish someone had told me this was supposed to be a comedy. I was laughing for all the wrong reasons - stupidity ! I didn't even watch it till the end, and couldn't care less how it ended. Sorry, folk - this is a real stinker on all sides.",1,4,7,6 June 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," ..atruly epic lesson in the cruelty human inhumanity..
","Of all the many comments I've read here, so far, only one has mentioned the just-as-fabulous documentary on the rail-tracks winding through several Asian countries. I think it was 'gcaplan'. Every mile of this very long railroad cost hundreds-of-thousands of lives; 'The History Channel's' brilliant documentary broadcast actual filmage.'Bridge on the River Kwai' was only ONE of the tragedies the Japanese army - in their misguided obsession of 'honor' - inflicted on fallen enemies and the citizens of countries they conquered, certainly in their brutality toward inmates of prison-camps. Doesn't it sound just a little like 'the-master-race' mantra Hitler's officers trumpeted? Director David Lean definitely displays it (from the Wilson-Foreman script) to some degree; other viewers brought-out the fact that 'Col. Nicholson' (Alec Guinness) would have been tortured to a more grotesque degree, or merely shot and discarded. Perhaps the 'honor' Sessue Kayakawa's character portrayed was his respect for the 'tight-lipped' Brit. As many viewers wrote, much of this film was fictional, as almost all war-films are. Cinematographer Jack Hildyard used every advantage of 'cinemascope' in graphically and beautifully photographing the entire film, even the ugly parts of it.'Bridge' documented the Asian holocaust, which many war-correspondents were writing about and the world was aware of, while Germany's holocaust became a shock only with its discovery, post-war.This is a film everyone should see - few movies have documented the horrors of war. Every actor-actress were brilliant in their roles, including William Holden ('Comdr. Shears') and Jack Hawkins ('Maj. Warden'. Guinness was stellar. BUT, it's the totality of the film that makes it the masterpiece it is. I personally feel it will forever remain a testament against any kind of war, never becoming 'dated' as so many younger viewers are wont to say.Its horrific brutality makes us swear 'never again,' that is, until we think of the carnage that is currently (2008) being waged in Iraq. We want to think USA soldiers would never become so brutal, although they are trained to be killing-machines......until we are shown graphic videos, details of the trials at Haditha (Iraq). We all have those traits lurking within us, when conditions force them upon us.This gripping film entertains in a sordid demeanor, but should be required viewing for anyone who could be in a position to declare, promote and aid-and-abet any form of war. It deserves a much higher rating that most viewers gave it.",10,1,3,7 January 2008
Man on Fire," ..wild fireworks, no real story..
","Early-on in 'Man on Fire', 'Creasy' (Denzel Washington) asks 'Rayburn' (Chris Walken) 'will we ever be forgiven for what we've done?'. That kinda lets us know writer Tony Scott has persuaded director Brian Helgeland (?) to put some pretty heavy stuff in this movie. When we have been informed there is a kidnapping in Mexico City every 2 minutes, and then meet that handsome father (who needs a NEW bodyguard for his daughter), it is apparent this is going to be a violent movie. Didn't you pick-up, right away, the father was the bad guy?As we watch 'Creasy' handle his 'piece' (gun) with streams of sweat runnng off his body, we begin to wonder if it's unnecessary for him to handle another 'piece' - the orgasm has already occurred.All that sweetness from Dakota Fanning (Pita) does not provide any salvation for 'Creasy' - swimming-lessons do not make-up for the incessant brutality in the rest of this story.....we know it's coming and will not cease till the last frame is screened. There is no reason to name the other actors/actresses in this film; no matter how well they played their roles - except for Giancarlo - they are just visitors to a world of senseless assassinations. We are totally assaulted with colorful explosions, plus all those special effects. Wow !...the cost of all those fire-arms must have matched Washington's salary... The cinematography was fabulous -but I thought the movie would never end, and didn't shed one tear when 'Creasy' so readily volunteered his life for Pita. 'Training Day' and 'Man on Fire' tell us that Denzel is running with the money......incessant nastiness, no good acting required.In the future, I shall watch this film when I am feeling like a monster. I wish I could get the same money Washington got.....sorry, folk: can't give any accolades to this film, except for the people who will cheer-on this one-man 'war'. Enough said......",5,1,6,9 February 2007
The Green Mile," Awesome - and a couple of comments how movies are made...
","I did read the tacky, little books this movie is based-on, when they first came out. I must admit I was not a Stephen King fan, but realized it was an ingenious way to lure people into buying the next installment. I don't remember being overly frightened, nor entertained, when I read them. I guess my imagination isn't that sharp.....it's visual for me. I bought the VHS without hesitation when I saw it - although I'm not a hard-core fan of Tom Hanks, either. The previews for 'Forest Gump' reassured me I would not like that film, because his 'southern' accent was far too forced, and knew I wouldn't get a thrill looking at a gang of contrived scenes upon which he would be pasted - that's acting ?Getting this wonderful film into theaters as quickly as it was done was a major undertaking. Considering its three-hour length, one can get an idea how many miles of wasted film is sitting-around in some vault, unless the first 'take' of every scene was perfect. Don't hold your breath for that: when you're dealing with a number of actors in a multitude of scenes, you can bet someone was not quite perfect. The only way to test that is to watch the 'dailies', hoping 50+ takes aren't wasted film. You can't use it again, like magnetic tape or digital images. Once the film is exposed, that's what you get and is a MAJOR cost for making a film of this length. I never waited with baited breath for a film just because it was being directed by a certain person, edited by a certain person; some actors I watch for new work, but many are often miscast.The beauty of a film - once it is handed to them - IS determined by the skill of the editor. Yet, their work is usually hampered by a dictatorial director, impositions from producers and influence of some of the actors. Unless they can demonstrate a 'cut' would be more valuable to the over-all beauty of the film, their expertise and their foresight usually are disregarded, because they work under extreme scrutiny. Yet, their work is more intense than any other individual working on the film. The raw footage has to be put together, regardless. A good editor can judge where the movie is going, just looking at the film as it is handed to them. Unless he has worked with a director several times, they don't always agree - if they can convince the director to consider another premise, it is this artist who can influence the scenes to be re-shot, even after the film is considered to be 'in the can'. If the director wants to do a re-cut, it's this artist who must remember - or search the unused film - what he saw where and do the actual work. An editor must be a very open-minded, resilient artist.A script is only pages with words on them - how often is the entire script re-written? Who else knew the depth of the characters but Stephen King? Maybe a suggestion here, a suggestion there......he was a natural to write the script. If an actor says 'what a beautiful script', it is usually said in self-interest, because they must give the words life. True acting-artists have a foresight of the entire film, scene-by-scene, and sacrifices some of his value to allow all of the actors to give their best work, gambling on the finished product will be a film an audience wants to watch. How sad so little mention is given to the person who keeps detailed notations of every detail of the scene - who was where, the last line to be spoken, how the actors looked, etc.....invaluable.....considering what prominent billing is given to cameramen, lighting technicians, set-dressers and myriad other craftsmen.These are only some of the most important protagonists in the making of a movie; if they were female, right on. 'The credits' list the hundreds of other people involved. If some of them say 'it was fun,' it is usually in relief it all came together so quickly, 'fun' being translated into dedicated 'work'. To produce a monumental film such as 'The Green Mile' is, multiply the effort by a thousand. That the film was produced in such a short period of time is a testament of the MONUMENTAL effort made by all concerned, to produce something to be proud of.Even the least important worker on this film can be proud. I'm certain there was much applause on the sets to reward extra-ordinary effort. It is a film to readily cry over, because not only is the story inspiring and magical in every way, it draws the viewer into it to live the story, never having seen the insides of a prison. I've written these dull comments to demonstrate the behind-the-scene effort to make the classical film it is. How fortunate we'll always have it.6/16/07 - THE 2ND VHS CASSETTE - Every time I need inspiration, a quiet lesson in compassion - whatever - I play this consummate piece of what I consider to be best of what I've ever seen for the greatest, truest display of acting-talent, sure-sighted direction and - again - the ultimate editing. I doubt seriously if a better cast will ever be assembled again, or a more realistic filming of how things were 'then'. Every scene is perfect. If you haven't watched 'The Green Mile', DO - and really get into it. The second cassettte contains all you need to remember about the easily understood horrors of the first. This is not a 'flick' - it is an experience.",10,0,3,4 May 2006
Platoon," ..well-made drama..
","Even for 'Platoon', a quote from 'Apocalypse Now' says it all: 'a bunch of 4-star clowns were giving the whole circus away' is just as relevant here. Add to that, two US presidents who were busy lying to us. Those 'users' who wrote 'an army who fights itself cannot win the war.' also tells a loud tale. Once the draft set-in, it was all down-hill, because the younger the soldiers were, the more unprepared they were for jungle-warfare- maybe all those guys who went to Canada had insights the other grunts didn't, plus officers who were totally unprepared for combat and useless at trying to lead. Kids who had just graduated from high-school and were reveling in their budding manhood, from owning their first automobile certainly weren't ready to leave the nest of home and fight in a savage jungle. AND - I want to correct 'Polaris_P.b' for saying there were too many Black soldiers in the movie - wake-up, guy: that race was the most vulnerable to be drafted and volunteering, because they had no future to look forward to. They were about half of the fighting-force. You noticed their presence in THIS movie, because in other wars they were segregated from the general troops, and ALWAYS had the most dangerous assignments. Lots of horrendous tales to be told about them....Although much was made about Charlie Sheen almost being eaten alive - several times - by ants, no one mentioned the two cobras he encountered at close-range. That would have kept me out of the jungle entirely.This movie is near being flawless, but that characteristic can be really gleaned only after several viewings. With the war raging between Beringer's and Dafoe's characters - and the danger of not knowing whom you are shooting at - how could there be any morality among the troops? I worked in Hawai'i during that war, which was a big 'R-&-R' retreat. I met so many guys who were just as frightened at every sound THERE as they must have been in Vietnam. I suspect a lot of them went AWOL from there. As so many 'users' picked-up, the whole thing was about staying alive. Even if they did, they had no idea how terribly they would be treated when they went home. 'War is hell' is just an announcement that the war to keep your sanity, at home after the battle, would be almost as bad. See 'The War at Home', which just happens to star Martin Sheen as the father of a Vietnam veteran......one of his real sons.This movie dulls the senses even as you watch it. I get so involved, I can't even separate the characters - I'm amazed I can recognize the three main actors, and that's only because they're in almost every scene. I never did recognize Johnny Depp, who was almost chosen as the main character, but was too young.....and Oliver Stone predicted he would be a future major-star. As hateful as he was, Beringer was brilliant, as was Defoe underplaying his more humane officer with bravery to spare, as was Charlie Sheen's ability to act from 'cheese-d--k' to seasoned fighter. The whole scene of destroying the peasant village was too realistic and heartbreaking. Sheen's rescuing the girls from being raped, outstanding - after all, 'rape and pillage' were a bi-product of every war since the beginning of time.Turning our youngest men into 'killing-machines' ('Jarhead') absolutely guarantees they will never live a normal life. If a movie can arouse such fear, how much worse can actually taking part in one be? The big battle at the end of the movie - when the soldiers are begging to be spared from close fighting and willing to injure themselves to get out of it - certainly points-out American troops can't always hack-it when the going gets rough. Especially, when the enemy has been fighting longer - and has a stronger determination to win because they are fighting on their own territory - as the VC were, and about the same in Iraq. If this country has ever fought a deceitful war, that is it.Oliver did create a real classic - how skillfully he controlled every aspect, how brilliant was his script to depict the only salvation for the troops was to get lost in drugs and alcohol. The cinematography, simply gorgeous; special effects, totally real-looking; 'Elias'' final scene expected but devastating; Sheen's shooting Beringer, bravo ! Every actor was stellar and the crew brought all of their skills to the front to make this movie timeless - with a deep prayer 'can't we just get along?' Required viewing for everyone........even the weak-hearted.",10,0,1,2 August 2006
Raging Bull," ..all you macho guys...
","Like several other commentators, I just couldn't sit through this film on a couple of tries. I had no idea it was made 25 years ago, but it made no difference - I just don't get into overly graphic violence in a film. If people are really that way, then they have a big problem. I'm not a fan of any particular director/actor/actress - the finished product has to get to me. I think I've seen only one film with De Niro that isn't brutal - 'The Score'......anyone else see that ? Yet, I think he is a good actor, because he makes me see and understand people I don't like to be around.No praise to heap on anyone, no matter how many others think it was the greatest film of all time (????), or of the '80s (?????). I can see how people who need all that violent action got into this film, but I'll take a good story over it, anytime. I've noticed all of the commentators were male. Hmmmmmmmm - that causes me to wonder about them. I just read an obituary for a young man who died of prize-fighting injuries at a very early age. Prize-fighting, to me, is purely sadistic - that females are now engaging in that 'sport' is just horrific. No doubt good work by all the crew - good acting by De Niro and Pesci - just leaves me cold, and am wondering how I made it through the whole thing this time.........Boo !",2,13,35,17 June 2006
Blade Runner," ..I hated this movie..
","..and didn't even know what a 'blade-runner' was/is before I read some of these 'philosophical' comments. I remember seeing parts of this movie before, and still can't decide if it is only a 'replicant' for a movie.I agree that Ridley Scott did a fabulous job getting the whole thing together. It lost me the minute I saw all those chimneys belching fire into the sky over the city where I live. My opinion is Philip K. Dick wrote a fantastic script, but I think he needs to see a shrink, along with all those who consider the film to be 'genius'. So many of the people who wrote comments seem to think it was a huge box-office success at its original release - PBS's host tells the truth: Scott and Harrison Ford ('Rick Decark') hated the stuff he was forced to add to it by the people who REALLY put-up the money.......the loan-sharks, who took-over the rights to it before it was released. Smart folk, they knew it would eventually become fabulously successful and recognized as a masterpiece. I saw the director's cut.I still don't like it. All that contrived stuff about the value of life (and the way it will be) still doesn't tell a story. The cinematography was brilliant, but I like Los Angeles as it is now, bright and airy. Let's see: this is 2007, and the story takes place in 2019......I guess in 1982, that seemed a long time away.......just give us some of that constant rain, if it's not poison.....'The Bradbury Building' (today factually as it was originally built) must have been paid a fortune for all the damage they did to it. I saw NO beauty in this film - it doesn't matter how famous most of the actors/actresses became: they deserve the accolades, but THE STORY was a bunch of junk, in my opinion. I don't want to have to 'dig' for the story - I want the story told intelligently to me in a plot I can easily understand.With due respect to all of the millions who love this movie, I can't imagine watching it again. If that is how our world will become, stop it and let me off now.........",1,10,46,3 June 2007
The Deer Hunter," ..a realistic story of what war does to men..
","Please read some of the other reviews to get the story of this momumental film.I was delighted that so many people caught the intention of this movie - another great one from the 70s - to give a commentary on how such brutality completely destroys everyone who is involved in it. The Vietnamese War actually ruined many lives of people who never were there; had I been a parent in that era, I would have gladly sent my sons to Canada to prevent them from being drafted. Some 'users' state the term 'enlisted' - voluntary. Maybe a few did, but the majority of the men sent there were drafted; because the story was about White Russians in Pennsylvania, there weren't many African Americans in it. How ironic that is, because that race toward the end of the conflict, when troops were getting scarce, were the predominant men (barely out of their teens) who were sent to war. I think Cimino did a disservice to them; there should have been more in the hospital scene. I saw one.Younger people may not be aware of the uproar against this war. Just as President Bush has had to be slightly 'untruthful' about his reasons for the 'war on terror' in Iraq, Lyndon Johnson did not tell the whole truth about many actions he ordered for Vietnam. He was so distraught when the truth was made public, he decided not to run for re-election. Richard Nixon, along with the many other despicably criminal actions he was involved in, lied about heavily bombing Cambodia ('The Killing Fields'), he resigned the presidency rather than face being impeached. While shouting 'democracy!', some of our presidents became meglamaniacs with the power that office holds. We can only wait to see how history handles Bush.......unfortunately, the world is heavily peopled with Muslims. Not all of them want to become Americans nor democratic; they know little of that. Their cultures are so much older than ours.There are a lot of films that depict the dreadful battles fought in Veitnam; 'The Deer Hunter' mercifully showed only one major one, while concentrating on how brutality eventually causes insanity, with the total insanity of the Vietnamese to get out of Saigon. Our government turned its back on thousands of boys-hardly-yet-men, closing its eyes on their torture once they returned home. 'The War on Terror' has produced almost as many ruined lives, plus sending troops ill-equipped to fight. Hmmmmmm.........DeNiro (Mike) actually prepared for his role by visiting steel-mills and meeting the workers and their stouthearted families. No wonder they drank so much ! 'Trivia' also tells us the entire cast and crew slept on the floor of a warehouse for five days while those scenes were being shot. This is by far one of DeNiro's best roles; he was young and so energetic, and was given a beautiful script by Deric Washburn. Bravo! to DeNiro. Again, Bravo! to Christopher Walken (Nick) for his brilliant performance, and also John Savage (Steven) for his stellar acting in all of his scenes. Realism to the extreme. Meryl Streep (Linda) was so into her role, she actually adlibbed most of her lines; this was her audition for 'Sophie's Choice'. Johns Cazale (Stanley) was his usually obnoxious character, giving his final, great performance. Po Pao Pee (the 'Russian roulette' referee) was the epitome of total detachment in those harrowing scenes, showing that some folk CAN ignore their participation in brutality - the bosses of the game stoically ate their meal and raked-in the cash for the final game. Julien Grinda (Pierre Segui) was the sole character left from decades of French colonialism in Vietnam and the mess they left it in, portraying people who manage to live through situations they cannot control. Cinematography rates a 10, at least......Yes, we needed that hour at the beginning of 'The Deer Hunter' to become acquainted with those naive men who lived their lives to the fullest, before going off to war. It was necessary to know them to compare the misery all of their lives became. Several of the actors were injured; it was a dangerous movie to film. 'Steven's' realization his wounds made him unfit for family life; 'Nick's' addiction to heroin gave him the stamina to 'roulette' for money; 'Mike's' guilt for coming-out of it all whole, and failing to save 'Nick', then loving 'Nick's' lady; the introversion of 'Steven's' wife; the solemn funeral and breakfast for 'Nick'; all of this is the real 'Deer Hunter'.Life is like that. During 'God Bless America' at the end, all of the characters knowing they intensely loved their country, no matter what, broke my heart. Yet, it also gave me strength to realize we Americans ARE a truly heroic people - not perfect, but mostly good - this is one of my favorite films, and again I want to rate a 50 to honor the gigantic effort it took to bring this thriller to the screen -",10,4,10,28 September 2006
Heat," ..this film was too busy for me..
","Michael Mann wrote and directed a film that must have wasted miles of film - there were so many scenes in 'Heat,' I could hardly watch it. So many, in fact, it was difficult to keep-up with the story. That means I shall have to watch it again.Al Pacino's ('Lt. Han') frantic actions wore me out. De Niro's character ('McCauley') had a calming effect, but the only scene I thought was worthy of his talent was the scene in the restaurant, talking to Pacino. Kilmer's role ('chris) was excellent and insistent. Jon Voight ('Nate') did what he could with what he was given to do. It's so sad this great actor does not seem to be able to find a role to show his range of talent.Of course, the action in the film pleased everyone who likes all that loud stuff. The special-effects were great, and the stunt-folk must have made a fortune.I'm glad that so many people commented on 'Heat.' BUT, there are so many other films exactly like it, the story gets lost it all that fire-power. Perhaps I'll get more from it on the second watching. I gave it a '10' because it all came together, although it was very predictable. I liked the touch of closeness at the end......showed a touch of humaneness, even with so much violence.",10,2,5,13 May 2008
Windtalkers," ..am I the only person who enjoyed this movie?..
","When I discovered I could own VHS or DVD for almost the same price I'd be paying to go to a theater, theater-going stopped right then. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE theaters, but I'm gonna pay more to enter only to see it once? What's eBay for ?? The last time I was in a theater, 'The Day After Tomorrow' was released. I arrived two minutes after the previews began, and I wasn't allowed to be seated. HUH? So, I had to wait till the next feature, making it almost the midnight-show on Saturday. After the frustration of waiting such a long time and really wanting to see that movie, I paid almost $15.00 to see it. I didn't regret paying the entrance-fee - but, decided it would be some while before I'd be plunking-down that much money for a film. Now I watch at home, anytime I want......not having to bother with unruly people, and being as unruly as I want to be.Hey! I wanted to see 'Windtalkers' - I didn't even notice that Nicholas Cage was in it; maybe not his kind of movie, but I enjoyed and could relate to his punch-drunk character. I had seen rushes of the movie on the front of other home-movies, and thought it would be interesting. I wasn't familiar with Mr. Woo's directing nor any of the other actors. I'd never heard of Navajos being used in WAR 2 as 'coders', but think that was a good idea. I agree with those people who think it's rather late for their efforts to be recognized, and YES - they should have expanded that theme much stronger. The two 'coders' looked like Native Americans to me - isn't it possible there's a fraction of mixed-blood in there? I thought both their roles were well-played, but was kinda skeptical they weren't trained to fight. Yahzee was a sympathetic character, and Cage made-up for all that killing, anyway.....and Yahzee turned into a good Marine, don't-cha think?I got exactly what I expected to see - a war-picture. I thought the explosions were just a bit bright, but loved the color. For that time-period, 'Japs' was a plausible term. After all, they started the whole war, huh? But, I certainly don't think it's appropriate, in view of the many American-Japanese troops who fought on our side in that war, to lay-it-on too heavily. I've seen all the other movies about war some of the commentaries mention - to prevent being disappointed is not to expect too much.So, yeah - I DID enjoy 'Windtalkers', all three times I've watched it. What really irked me about reading what other people wrote about it is, WHY are some of the same commentaries posted three times? Lighten-up, folk: it ain't that bad of a movie.......",8,0,4,9 May 2006
Gladiator," ..the whole movie was wonderful..
","I absolutely agree with every favorable comment written here. I can find no fault with David Frazoni's story nor Ridley Scott's direction. The cinematography was amazing and colorful; I did not find the CGIs to be intrusive. That the entire production involved so many thousands of people is a testament to filmmakers' ability to produce beautiful, thoroughly enjoyable movies, eve today. 'The Gladiator' serves them all up in a gorgeous heap.Mention 'gladiator' and 'Rome' and a whole plot comes to mind, but this one certainly combines the necessity of bloodshed, gentility and nobility with action in one grand epic. It is sufficiently historically accurate, but it really IS the story which is the 'star' in this film. Although all of them gave magnificent performances, it isn't necessary to list all of the cast here. I've read eleven pages of the huge total; I'm sure other readers will read some of them, too. It is, however, irreverent not to praise 'bad-boy' Russell Crowe doing his act here so eloquently, with principled reverence. Truly, Bravo! Mr. Crowe. AND - an early exposure to Djimon Hounsu in a good role.With the polyglot that Rome was, one should not be surprised to find a contradiction to 'chris_j_albanese', who says (I think) there was no homosexuality in 'The Gladiator'. 'Chris' must have missed the scene when Roman guards come to the senator's home to drag him off to jail, with the senator shoo-ing his 'painted' companion away.....When I tried to re-wind my VHS-cassette - a home-made gift from a friend - it wouldn't. Therefore, I'll be buying the wonderful DVD in the near future, so that I can continue to put-in a lot of time watching this movie, just as I've been doing for about four years. I consider it to be the best of this genre. It must sound rather like a broken record, but I thank every technician who did anything to bring this gem to the screen. It's good for every emotion - an easy 30....",10,1,1,19 October 2006
The Wizard of Oz," ..what else to say ?..
","No one can imagine what a sensation 'Wiz' made at its original release. I was there - I saw it - and, quite frankly - I was not a child, even then......no one you knew had a penny, and could hardly afford the $1.25 I paid to see it. Many reviewers talk about '65 years', etc., much longer by now.......It was sheer magic - even to older survivors of the great depression. It took many adults back to a magical dream of a childhood become too-long bleak by the lack of money, just as 'The Grapes of Wrath' was a testament to grinding poverty. That it has preserved so many factors of life and has endured through the decades since its release, what a inspiring document to people of all ages.Much has been written about the three-line process of recording color on film in the late 30s. It's this startling revelation to the eyes, this brilliance on the senses which make those films which used it so indelible on the mind and heart. This brilliance is far above the 'natural' colors we see in today's movies.Although the entire cast could hardly be assembled today, no individual's names is necessary to make 'Wiz' the most healing-of-the-soul movie it is. No matter your age, close your eyes and it will play for you. It may be a fairytale, but if only life were more like it. Wherever, see it.......",10,8,9,3 June 2007
