Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You can't be serious...
","I feel like this is a real life tale of 'The Emperor's New Clothes.' First off I am a huge fan of Da Ali G show, Borat being my favorite character. The show has had me in tears laughing many times and I was very hopeful that the movie would deliver the same results.It didn't! The television show is funny because the humor is much more subtle where as the movie literally shoves it in your face between two hairy butt cheeks. Cohen even seems to deliver the lines differently. The movie tries way too hard which cancels out any comedic value.Nothing in this movie offended me. Nothing in this movie was new or original. Therefore nothing in this movie was funny. I remember a time where movies were funny because they relied on great writers and actors. This seems like a very long time ago.Don't waste your time or your money, watch the show and if you must rent it.If this is the what we consider the funniest movie ever, I have serious concerns for our evolution.
