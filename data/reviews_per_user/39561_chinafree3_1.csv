Requiem for a Dream," Shaking, impressive, rhythmic
","The title was already promising. Then I watched it, slightly stoned, and the outstanding editing, the mixture of slow and fast pace, and the music (that I think it is a free adaptation of a requiem) takes you in a crescendo visual trip to a final apotheosis that takes your breath away.There is this undertone of the Crime and Punishment theme. Let's face it, it is a pessimistic movie, but if anyone knows of someone that took this twisted road of drugs, you know that's how things are likely to develop. It is an overdose of reality that gives it credibility.The plot stands out of other drug movies like Trainspotting or Drugstore Cowboy thanks to the old lady's personal addiction hell.I don't get tired of watching it and I recommend it to everyone. Thanks to Darren and all the crew for shaking us to the bone.",9,0,1,6 December 2005
