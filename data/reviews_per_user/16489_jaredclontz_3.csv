The Perks of Being a Wallflower," This is amazing, a must watch
","This movie has an excellent plot. After watching this I read the book and could really feel the characters. For me it was like stepping back into the early 90's. this movie really needs to get above a 5. I do not recommend letting 8 year old kids watch this, it is to big for them. But read the book and you'll Cherish this movie a lot more. watch it it will bring you to tears and trust me you will have a lot of new favorite songs. But I recommend watching the movie first so you can compare the movie to the book while reading it. This is certainly a must watch. But keep in mind do not do any of the stuff they do in the movie if you're 20 and under.",10,0,0,6 July 2013
Man of Steel," It does the superman movie franchise justice
","This movie exceeded all my expectations but the reason I'm giving it and eight is that near the end where Kal-El and Zod are fighting at the end, I couldn't get over how much damage was done to Metropolis and wondering how many deaths must be happening. And so much as Superman and Zod fighting was awesome but it came down to Superman just snapping his neck. But don't get me wrong it was cool seeing Superman like this, it is a new take on him and I like it a lot. I love Christopher Reeve and Tom Welling and this Superman in this movie was a combination of those two. I highly recommend this movie, Henry Cavil did an amazing job if you're a superhero fan you will enjoy this.",9,2,8,7 July 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," better than the first ones
","I really enjoyed this movie. It brings new life to the franchise of THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. It goes in great depth of how Peter Parker turns into SPIDERMAN. I mean it wasn't fake looking, like the high school looked as if it were real because in some movies you say that is nothing like how high school is like but it was portrayed very well. Then when he was making his web shooters you just saw all these blue prints and you saw him make. You can tell that this SPIDERMAN is closer to the one in the comics. Although the suit wasn't the same you can role with it. But the plot was well written and for once the girl friend was never kept hostage. The acting was really good Andrew Garfield is (29 or 30) Emma Stone is (24 or 25) in real life in there acting made you believe they were actually 17. There's a lot of kissing scenes but you know what who cares that is what makes you believe there young. The LIZARD was well done and everything made you think that this really could happen (cross genetics.) Screw the critics this is an awesome movie and if your a Spidey fan you will love it. P.S. They have really good songs chose too.",10,34,49,28 July 2013
