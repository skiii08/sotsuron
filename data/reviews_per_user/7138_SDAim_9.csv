Black Swan," Duck soup
","Everyone has posted some really good and lengthy critiques of this film, so I'll keep this short. I wasn't ready for the unintentionally funny, W-A-A-A-A-A-Y over the top, and completely silly plot twists in 'Black Swan' -- I figured with all the Oscar buzz and nominations, it had to be decent. Wow.That having been said, I have no problem with Natalie Portman's nomination because I've always felt she is a good actress, and she obviously put her heart and soul into this very physically demanding roll. I wouldn't, however, be completely shocked if Annette Benning pulls the upset on Sunday.",1,11,19,23 February 2011
Gravity," Worst casting decision EVER
","Really?? Sandra Bullock as a 'brilliant scientist'? You have to be effing kidding me.I wish IMDb allowed you to submit reviews of just one line, because that would have been enough for me. That sums up the entire problem with this film -- oh, and the other completely unrealistic and silly twists and turns along the way don't hurt, either. I saw it in a 3D IMAX theater, and while the scenes from space were beautiful, I really couldn't get past the rest of it.Yes, Sandy Bullock is Everyman's sweetheart, and her winning the People's Choice award proves my point. I have always thought she is a terrible actress, and she basically turned this film into 'Speed in Space'. If IMDb had an audio function, I would add a sound clip of me doing an impression of her great 'acting' from this film -- but perhaps you can do it, too. Just go, 'Aaaah Aaaah Aaaah Aaaah Aaaah' in the most annoying nasally voice that you can muster at just the right nails-on-a-chalkboard pitch, and you've got it. If she wins the Oscar, someone kill me, please.",6,9,16,10 January 2014
Midnight in Paris," If you love Paris, the film is worth it for the opening montage alone
","While I've caught most of Woody's last few films on NetFlix (I think the last one I saw in the theater was Match Point), I wanted to make sure to see Midnight in Paris on the big screen for the full effect. I was not disappointed -- I had tears streaming down my cheeks within the first two minutes, feeling as if I'd been transported to beautiful Paris for a couple of hours.I think this is a fine film, and it was certainly entertaining -- with a core message that I can understand and relate to. When you've seen most of Woody's films over the years, you immediately recognize the character 'types' reappearing in slightly different situations with other actors in the rolls. That's a double-edged sword in that there's something familiar about the ebb and flow of his films, but it can also be somewhat trite and annoying. Fortunately, that didn't seem to bother me as much in this film because the historical characters helped to draw some attention away from the more formulaic ones, and really added a lot of spice. I don't think this is one of Woody's top five films, but it's certainly the best (and only) 2011 summer release I'm planning on seeing . . . it's slim pickings in the theater these days for people with a brain.",8,3,6,24 June 2011
American Hustle," I really enjoyed the soundtrack . . .
","From all the hype and buzz surrounding this film, I was expecting to be blown away. I was not. To me, it was just okay, and the best part was the music, the hairdos, and of course, the clothes. The storyline was a little confusing, and, as someone else commented, it was hard to find a single, likable character to root for. I thought, at first, Bradley Cooper was going to be that guy, until he went completely wacko and turned out to be the worst of the bunch.Also, I really like all of these actors and thought their performances were great (Christian Bale slipping into an unintended Al Pacino impression a couple of times, notwithstanding), but it was a bit like watching 'Silver Linings Playbook' all over again. I don't know why it bothered me when David O. Russell recycled his cast and it played like a re-run, but someone like Woody Allen or Christopher Guest can do it and the film feels fresh and funny. I think, at the end of the day, perhaps Mr. Russell isn't my favorite director in the world. At any rate, if you go not expecting too much, the experience is worth it, especially since the story is somewhat based on actual events. However, if you are trying to choose between this and a lot of the other fantastic films out this awards season, perhaps save this one for a NetFlix rental.",5,2,3,10 January 2014
Fargo," Best movie ever. Endastory.
","You either get Fargo or you don't. I have a friend who now thinks I like 'quirky' movies and has recommended some not-great films, since she really didn't understand why this film struck such a chord with me.Sure, being from Wisconsin helps. It was the first time I recall sitting in a theater and laughing hysterically -- my husband actually had to whisper in my ear at one point, 'Ssssh! Try to keep it down!' I had never heard anyone nail that accent and the mannerisms of that area so well, and it floored me. But, more than that, the characters are so brilliantly created --the hooker from White Bear Lake ('Go Bears!')-- not only added to the story, but was absolutely hilarious. Here it is almost 20 years later (impossible to believe!) and there isn't a day that goes by when I don't utter at least one classic Fargo line.The best. Period.",10,0,1,10 January 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Decent enough remake of a better Swedish film
","I think that, for the most part, this was a perfectly fine remake of the Swedish 2009 film, but that's exactly the problem. Why do something that's already been done better -- and not that long ago, to boot? Everyone was very good in their roles -- I think finding Rooney Mara for the lead was key, because if you don't have the right Lisbeth, the whole thing goes downhill fast. But it did seem kind of weird that they're all supposed to be in Sweden, yet everyone is speaking English. Again, a reason to see the original and leave it at that.Another thing that bugged me was the ending -- please stop reading if you don't want a spoiler. When they showed Lisbeth going to Mikael's house with a gift for him, and she sees him emerging with his arm around Erika, Lisbeth is obviously upset and hurt. She throws the expensive jacket into the trash, and vrooms off on her motorbike. In the original film, we surmise that Lisbeth and Mikael's relationship wasn't really anything more than friends with benefits -- in fact, I don't remember them having sex more than once. Lisbeth seems like she'd have a L*O*N*G way to go before she could be intimate with a man in any meaningful way, so the whole last scene in the U.S. remake didn't really ring true to character. I left the theater wondering if the director did that to make her more likable to American audiences -- can we not handle the fact that Lisbeth is a very damaged young woman who isn't going to see Mikael as her knight in shining armor? At least they didn't have Lisbeth and Mikael ending up 'together' as a couple -- that really would have been insulting. Gee . . . Erika or Lisbeth -- who would any guy in his right mind have gone for?",8,0,3,29 January 2012
Les Mis√©rables," Oh my god --- is it over yet???????
","We had no intention of seeing this film as it sounded and looked awful, but were finally brow-beaten into it by two different couples (whose taste we generally agree with). They assured us that it was wonderful, spectacular, and drove them to tears.Well, about five minutes into it, I was moved to tears, too -- realizing I'd made a horrible mistake. All of our worst fears about this film were true -- horrible, horrible 'singing' and miscasting right and left. Not to mention, we're in frickin' France -- what's up with the little cockney kid? When did it turn into Oliver? I don't understand why people are gushing over this mess, and why in the world Anne Hathaway is nominated for an Oscar, much less the shoe-in favorite to win it. She was on screen for about five minutes before she croaked. I was completely unmoved by her performance -- it all happened too fast to care what happened to her. Character development, anyone? All the way home, my husband and I mockingly made up our own lyrics and sung them in the over-the-top, terrible style of just about everyone in the film. That was far more entertaining, and a much better use of our time. Now, if I could only have my $22 and 2-3/4 hours of my life back. Miserable, indeed.",1,16,31,21 February 2013
Win Win," I will see just about anything with Paul Giamatti in it
","In an effort to clear out our DVR in time for a gazillion hours of Summer Olympics coming up, my husband and I went on an Indie film bender and watched about 10 flicks that we had recorded. Out of all of them, only two really stood out -- Win Win and In a Better World, a small Danish film. I had resisted seeing Win Win in the theater, honestly, because it didn't look like something I'd like based on the trailer. I thought it was going to be one of those feel-good, high school sports movies with the troubled kid and the coach who turns everything around and everyone goes home happy. This had many more layers to it, as all of the other positive reviews posted here will attest to.My big takeaway from this film is that I really trust Paul Giamatti's choices of roles, and until he proves otherwise, I will see him in anything he does. I am also amazed at the range of characters he can play, and his ability to make a huge difference in a film even if the part he plays doesn't seem that significant in terms of screen time. Win Win was truly a vehicle for him (as the film Barney's Version was a year or so ago), and he carries it with no problem. Great supporting performances here by Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannavale (who I currently love hating in Nurse Jackie), Jeffrey Tambor, and newcomer Alex Schaffer as the kid.",8,3,6,23 July 2012
The Social Network," Friend THIS
","I don't think this has any business being nominated for Best Picture -- it felt like a 'Movie of the Week' to me, or maybe an HBO Original Film. Definitely not worthy of a theatrical release, and MOST CERTAINLY no Oscar contender.I went to see this only because I make it a habit of seeing all Oscar nominated films and key performances so that I can really enjoy the awards show. I knew going in that I don't give a rat's behind about Facebook and feel that social networking is destroying, not enhancing our culture. Suffice it to say that the actors did a good job, talking way too fast and mumbling half their lines -- perfectly depicting the Facebook Generation. Glad I saw this via NetFlix and didn't spend $20+ at the movies.",2,7,11,23 February 2011
