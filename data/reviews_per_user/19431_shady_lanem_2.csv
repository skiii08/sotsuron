50 First Dates," Wouldn't it be nice....
","I bought this movie about 5 days thinking that this must be another one of Sandler's goof and lovely jokes (which I don't really intend to buy it at that time). To my surprise and astonishment, this is truly a remarkable romantic and lively piece of work Sandler has ever done. I would say it's the best movie he starred in the genre so far.The storyline amaze me of how romance can turn out to anyone at anyplace, anyhow, regarding of any circumstances one is encountering. Love truly is blind....no matter how you view the person that you love, try your best to be with her/him and make her/him feel that life is meaningless without the everyday smiles on your face.This movie is worth 10/10",10,0,1,28 May 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Excellent piece of work!!!
","I saw this movie two days after it starts showing here which I believe is earlier by five days or so from US. Wonder why....Anyway, the 3rd installment starts with a bit of chilling likes where people that involves in any pirates related were to sentence to death. In which I view it as the power of marines started to shine.Following more deeply into the movie, various hilarious acts together with astounding acting crews liven up the storyline which was also adapted from the previous movies. I found that this last piece of work (from what I heard) venturing more into wider part of pirates world. Though I was a bit disappointed of the roles of other pirate lords. The most they've shown up is in the meetings.Overall, great casting fabulous work especially the new imaginary duplications of Jack Sparrow. They even talk among themselves without the guy himself.",10,1,1,26 May 2007
