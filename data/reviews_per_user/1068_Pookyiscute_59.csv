Kill Bill: Vol. 2," good, just not as good as vol. 1
","Although it still had a lot of thrills and great writing and acting, it lacked a lot of the same pizazz that the first volume contained.Tarentino brings us the continuation of the epic tale of a woman in search of revenge. With several scenes of violence as the first one held, some surprises, and a lot of great dialogue, you will not leave the film disappointed. However, with that being said, it wasn't quite as good as the first one. The continuation is almost like the second half of the first film, and from about the middle of the film on, it slowly decreases in intensity and for Tarentino almost has too much emotional value to it.I found it funny, entertaining and worth the rental fee, however it's not a film that I need to run out and buy. The first one was near excellence, while this one was a bit too cheesy for me. Although, I will admit there were two scenes that kept me guessing, and had me a little nervous of the outcome.All in all it's a good watch, and if you enjoyed the first volume, you should definitely check this one out.",6,0,2,1 May 2006
50 First Dates," So so
","I think this film, sort of falls right in the middle between bad and good. There are times when you almost want to turn off, because it can get really boring and dumb, and other times, when you almost feel like crying because of the emotion that the film carries. However, never do you feel the need to own this movie, or watch it every week.Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, star in their second romantic comedy together, as two people who are attracted to one another from the first day they meet. However, Lucy (Barrymore) has to be reminded of that fact every single day. She has short term memory loss, and it's up to Henry (Sandler) to convince her each and every day that he is the love of her life, and she of his.Picture 'Groundhog Day' only not as funny, cute or sweet. It's a really bad remake of that I guess. It does have it's moments though, of being sweet and cute, just not enough of them to make this one of the more worthy 'Happy Madison' productions. If you're a Sandler fan, I'd stick to 'Gilmore' and 'Wedding Singer', and if you're a Barrymore fan, stick with, 'Angels', and 'Mad Love'. This is not a better film for either actor, and I'm not terribly impressed with it.",5,1,1,15 May 2006
Catch Me If You Can," One of the best movies ever!
","I saw this movie twice in the theater, which is saying a lot, because I hardly ever even go to the theater to begin with. To say that Stephen Spielberg is a genius is an understatement, when it comes to films like this. Every single moment in the movie is captured with sheer brilliance and fantastic execution. He knows exactly how to make the audience feel with each and every different aspect that is delivered to us in each and every scene.Leonardo DiCaprio is of course famous for Titanic, and other films since then, but I would have to say that this is his best role to date, since 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?'. Although he is a character actor, and a good one at that, this role for him was perfect, because he not only was given the chance to be a 'character' but also the lead in the film. He is able to carry a whole movie on his shoulders with such ease it is so enjoyable to watch. Tom Hanks was certainly not one to forget in this film, either, though. His character, Handratty, was unforgettable as well. Hanks is able to make you hate him, feel sorry for him, and laugh at him all at once in 'Catch Me'. His accent is very well rehearsed, and there are times you forget that it is Tom Hanks, and not the real character he is playing.This movie will leave you cheering for the wrong team, and holding your breath at times. It is hard not to like this film, and I give it a full 10 for it's magic, beauty and true-to life story that it so gracefully delivers to us. A good watch and great film in general.",10,3,6,3 December 2005
The Ring," One of the best horror movies, ever!
","Horror is my favorite genre, let me start off by saying that. With that being said, however, it is extremely hard to find good horror movies. They're often referred to as, 'horr-ible' movies, which a lot of the time, can be true of them, since a majority of the horror movies that come out are generally low-budget, bad casted, 'B' movies. But, this movie, was quite different. It captures attention right from the beginning, and doesn't let go of your fearful imagination, until the end credits role. There is non-stop intensity throughout the entire movie, and each puzzle piece, discretely and carefully makes its way into the film, without you realizing it until the end. Naomi Watts, wasn't exactly well-known before this movie came out, and it was somewhat of a surprise(at least to me), that after it came out, she became more prominent in the film industry. She was of course excellent in it, however it was the type of role, any mediocre actress could have played.The other big surprise that the film offered, was that it was originally a Japenease movie. Usually the remakes, either aren't as good, or don't do well, just simply because they were originally foreign. However, this movie definitely is much more different, and is on a completely different level then some of the others we're used to seeing, or hearing about.I loved it, and it's definitely one of the best, and one of my favorite, horror movies. It's not at all slow, just at the right pace, scary, yet more phsychological than bloody. And, although I loved 'Scream', and 'The Blair Witch Project', it's sort of a happy medium between the two. It's not as bloody as 'Scream', and yet not as mind-warping as 'Project'. It's again, in a league of its own, with scare tactics, and I give the film, and original creator of the whole idea, behind, 'The Ring' a standing ovation, for his efforts, in inventing the piece.Anyone who's a horror lover, will certainly take to this as well. But, I will warn the people who loved movies like, 'House of 1,000 Corpses'. This is not that kind of movie, and far from satanic, by any means. Of course, that always depends on each individual person's opinion on what satanic is. I feel, that it is not. And, I will let you know in other film reviews, what I consider to be satanic. Like, 'Corpses'...which I felt was satanic. But, again, this is not, and if you do like the other types, where all it would entail, is demonic possession, or bloody ouiji boards, and such...this is not that kind of movie.Check it out though, if you are a horror fan. It's a great watch, and it didn't do well, for nothing'.",9,0,1,5 January 2006
Training Day," I loved it because I hated it
","Let me try and explain my feelings about this film. First of all, Denzel Washington was excellent in this. He deserved the award for best actor, and rightly so, for his work in this film. I hated him in this movie because I hated his character. Which should tell you how good a job he did in the movie. When you hate someone's character in a movie, so much, that generally means we're talking Academy Award. However, I don't think I was meant to hate the movie, too.A new rookie on his first day of Narcatics, meets with his unit leader at ten a.m. Already nervous, about making the team, he has no idea just how nervous he'll be by the end of the day. After only spending two hours with his leader, Hawke starts to become aware of what kind of cop he's dealing with, but only by the end of the film, do we really see what we the audience are given to deal with as well.Ethan Hawke was great in this too, and in some ways I think that he's a better actor than Washington. But, to be fair, Denzel is the star of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off of him, because of his performance in it.Again, it's hard for me to even understand how I felt about the film. I liked it and I thought it was well-written, but it just seemed like such a dark film, and I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, because it was so frustrating. But, I liked it well enough to give it a seven. So, there we are. Definitely not a film for anyone under seventeen, and not only is there some substance abuse, nudity, language, adult subject matter, and violence, but there is also some scenes that are very heavy to handle.Good performance though, and again...I loved it because I hated it.",7,0,1,7 February 2006
As Good as It Gets," Oscar-worthy
","If you missed the Oscars in 1998, then you probably don't know that this film won several awards, including; best actor and best actress. And although the film itself didn't walk away with an Oscar, it should have in my opinion. Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson star in this unusual film about life, that's more true to it, than one might think.What is this film about? That's an answer that the viewer of the film would have to make on their own. Some people might call it a love story, while others may refer to it as a human piece. Meaning, it's basis is human thought, feeling and being. It's interesting, sad, funny and beautiful all wrapped into one star-packed motion-picture.Greg Kinnear is probably the best in the film, and I was so upset that even though he was nominated for best supporting actor in this, that he didn't win. He was so good, and very believable in his role. Jack Nicholson is good, but he plays himself. This is the last film that I actually enjoyed seeing Helen Hunt star in, and would say that it might even be her best performance to date, leaving aside 'Castaway', which was by far and away her best role ever, although that wasn't a lead role, this was.James L. Brooks, does a terrific job communicating the struggle between all of the characters, but frankly it was the kind of movie, that any good director could have done, and would have been able to achieve, in my opinion, the outcome that Brooks did.But, for the kind of drama that the film is, it is very good. I recommend it to anyone over twelve, and although I say such a young age, it's still a movie that adults will certainly relate to. It's a movie you should own, and certainly a watch or two.",9,1,1,30 January 2006
Monster," Beyond excellent
","Charlize Theron should have a shrine dedicated to her, for the work she did in this movie. I would have to say that this one of the top five best performances ever given by an actress, or actor for that matter.Based on actual events, the story is set in Daytona Beach, FL, in the early 1990's. A poor-white female in her mid-thirties, ends up at a gay bar by mistake one night, just in hopes to have a drink. She meets Selby (Ricci), who offers to buy her a beer. Several hours later, the two become friendly, and Selby offers to have Lee (Theron), stay the night with her, since she has no home. The prostitute with no real job, money or place to stay accepts. The next evening they meet again, and begin their romantic relationship.Through a series of events, Lee, the prostitute turned lesbian, turns to murder and thievery, to keep herself alive, and her relationship with Selby as well.It is one of the best films to ever come out, not just in 2004. It will make you cry, and feel emotion for the loss, sacrifice, and hardships that the characters go through. It is an emotional ride through the eyes of a mentally tormented woman, and how she deals with the situations she is given in life.Charlize Theron, again was brilliant in this, and Christina Ricci was also profoundly well casted and her poignant moments in the piece as well.Definitely not a film for anyone under eighteen, but I would recommend it to anyone over that age. It's a film you don't want to miss, and is well worth the rental fee.",10,1,1,16 January 2006
Seven Years in Tibet," Excellent
","This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. I love watching it every so often, and learning new things that I missed the times before.The film has a great amount of interesting facts, and takes place in the 1930's through '50's. There are times when it is; magical, spiritual, enlightening, sweet, sad and poignant.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys interesting and true stories. If nothing else watch Pitt with his masterful portrayal of this real life character, who faces hardships, physically, spiritually and emotionally.",10,46,62,13 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," No wonder Johnny was nominated...
","Once again, Johnny Depp has outdone himself in this Academy Award nominated film.Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, reminded me of Dudley Moore's drunken character in Arthur.  I was also pleased to see Orlando Bloom take on the co-starring role as the blacksmith in love with the leading lady. Rush also did a noteworthy job, as usual as the bad pirate trying to kidnap, pillage and steal what is unrightfully his.Here is my rating overall for the film:Acting (with the exception of Depp whom I give a 10): 8.5 Writing: 7.5 Directing: 9 C.G.: 9.5One of the best movies to come out this year, and I am upset that this is the first time Depp has ever been nominated for an Oscar, because all of his work is so good, that he should be nominated for everything he does.  But, this was just as good if not better than all of his other work up to this point.I give the movie overall a 9 out of 10.  Besides, what's better than Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom?",Null,0,0,6 March 2004
Brokeback Mountain," A tragedy on so many levels...
","If you're thinking that this review is going to be politically incorrect, don't hold your breath because it's not. My headline, is in reference to the film itself, not the subject matter. It was a disappointing, slow, and sometimes boring film.The performances were outstanding, and the ones that really shined through were that of; Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway. Jake Gyllanhaal's performance was somewhat good, but it may have been his character I didn't care for, or he just didn't give it his all like I'd expected him to.If you don't know the plot already, you're in for a bit of a surprise. The two characters played by Ledger and Gyllanhaal, are bi-sexual, and although they lead happy normal lives with their wives and children, two or three times a year, the two men meet on Brokeback Mountain to share their secret love for one another, through reminiscing and sexuality.To be honest there were only two things I enjoyed about the film. The acting, and the cinematography. The acting was very realistic and at times brilliant, while the cinematography was phenomenal. Breathtaking and stunning, throughout the entire film. Everything else was a great disappointment. The story was even hardly worth a nomination let alone winning best screenplay. And, might I mention that although there are plenty of films out there that represent heterosexual adultery (which I don't advocate either), no one seems to acknowledge the fact that what these two men in the movie are doing, is extraordinarily selfish, and hurtful to their families. It was a strange film, and unanswered in a lot of ways.I wouldn't recommend it. I think it's just another drop of sadness to add to our declining culture. What a shame.",2,3,45,12 May 2006
Home Alone," I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do...
","One of the greatest movies ever made.  Probably the best family movie that came out in 1990, it appeals to kids of all ages and adults. Joe P. and Daniel Stern are great together and make you believe they really are the bad guys they're portraying.Basic plot: Macaulay Culkin's family decides to go to Paris for Christmas. The night before the entire twenty some family members leave for the airport, Kevin (Culkin) gets sent upstairs to the attic for 'acting out'. However, because of this, and a wish Kevin makes alone in his room to never see his family again, his family forgets that he was left alone upstairs, and by the time he wakes up the next day, he discovers he has '...made (his) family disappear.' All alone and nothing to do but take care of himself, two unsuspecting burglars decide to rob the house, but they aren't expecting Kevin to be ahead of their plan...A great family movie and still great to watch even as an adult. I give it a 10 out of 10.  Great to watch at Christmas as well.And that's my review.",Null,0,1,11 February 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Very good...
","Well-written, well-contrived on screen and very good performances, make this film apart of the, 'Deep Impact', Armagedden' pact.The world is suffering from global warming. What can you do? Well, in this possible world predicament, that's just the question that's on everyone's mind. Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllanhall and Emmy Rossman star in this intense drama about the end being near because of a natural disaster.This is the typical Hollywood movie, like 'Twister' or 'Volcano', which is truly meant to be watched on the big screen. But, it's still a good and loud one to have in your DVD collection.",7,0,0,19 January 2006
Crash," Outstanding, but so what?
","I'd be lying if I said that I didn't thoroughly enjoy this film, but I would also be lying if I said I learned anything from it. The makers of the picture, want us to think that we're stupid, and that we never knew that on a sub conscience level, that we are all racist. Guess what? We're not all racist.The movie circles around several different lives, who come from all different backgrounds; black, white, Persian, Mexican and others. All living in Los Angeles, the film shows the struggles and hardships and persecutions that these people go through in their daily lives. Taking place in the span of 24 hours, the film does do an excellent job of telling a story that is quite moving, and at times very intense.I thought everyone involved in the film was excellent, especially Saundra Bullock, who was my personal favorite, alongside Ryan Phillipe, who both did outstanding jobs. Not that the rest of the cast, shouldn't be noted on their work. The problem I had with the film was that they make it seem like all of America is racist, when in reality Americans have no conception of what racism is. We are so politically correct these days, that even if someone looks at you funny on the street, people automatically think it's because you're black? That makes no sense. They try to prove this point in the film. I disagreed with almost the whole film. Although it does shed light on a few interesting topics, that are more than likely true, it still felt like an advertisement, more than a film.However, I do appreciate the storyline, the direction, acting and cinematography. The individual stories in the film were excellent and it was quite entertaining to watch. I enjoyed it enough that I will probably see it again in the future, but it's definitely not one that I would recommend, to anyone who is offended easily.",7,0,6,17 April 2006
Forrest Gump," No wonder why it won best picture
","There are few films that come along, that will capture your; heart, mind and soul. This is one such film. There will never come a point when I will ever grow tired of seeing this film, or when it will ever not make me cry.Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career as 'Forest Gump'. This film centers around the life of one man, who's choices and luck, bring the world circled around his life. Meeting the President of the United States, solving crimes by accident, battling in the war in Vietnam, finding true love, and touching people's lives.The movie takes place throughout ten or twelve years of a mentally slow man's life, who has a way of moving, and touching your very heart.Robin Wright Penn also gives an outstanding performance, as Jenny, Forest's true love.Sally Field also has a small part, playing Tom Hanks' mother, and does a very comical and dramatic job.It's a film that will stay in the hearts of many, for years to come.",10,1,4,27 May 2006
10 Things I Hate About You," One of the best teen movies of all time...
","I can't say enough good things about this movie.  I do remember the first time I saw it, coming away thinking that I wanted to be just like Julia Stiles' character in it, though.  She was so cool and did such an excellent job in her role, that still to this day I consider her to be the coolest teen in any 'teen movie'. Basic Plot: Cameron (Levitt), a new student at Pagua high school, falls in love with a sophomore named Bianca Stradford (Oleynik). However, Bianca has a flirtatious crush on the most popular senior at school named, Joey (Keegan).  Cameron's sidekick Michael (Krumholtz)tells him, that Bianca is looking for someone to help her with French and Cameron decides that's how he'll ask her out on a date.Kat Stradford (Stiles) is Bianca's sister.  Totally opposite of Bianca, she is anti-social and is the most feminist high school senior you could ever meet.  Against boys, dances, and anything having to do with prepiness and silly fun, she swears off dating and finds herself being accepted to Sarah Lawrence a college across the country in hopes to get away from her father and the city she lives in.Bianca desperately wanting to date, is told by her father (Miller) that she will be allowed to date when her sister Kat does.  Desperate and not knowing how to get her sister to 'date for her', ends up asking Cameron, her new French tutor, to help her with her predicament. Enter Patrick (Ledger).  An outcast and rumored to have sold his kidneys on the black market for a new set of speakers, also attends Padgua high, and is unsuspecting of what will happen soon in his future.Cameron and Micheal decide that in order to make this work, they need a backer.  'Someone who's stupid, but has money.'  So they go to Joey, telling him that they know he likes Bianca, and they need him to pay Patrick a tidy sum, to have him date Kat, in order for him to date Bianca.  What Joey doesn't know, is that Cameron secretly plans to date Bianca, while he pays Patrick to take out Kat.It may sound like a very confusing movie.  But it is so funny, cleverly written, and not entirely true of American teenage culture, but pretty close.  The acting is wonderful and in my opinion nothing in the movie would have worked as well, without the people who played their characters.  As I said before I think that Stiles' portration of Kat Stradford was right on, and no one could have done it better. Her best role, more than certainly, and I love this movie so much!  I would have to say it's my favorite teen comedy next to The Breakfast Club.  One the best movies, and a great watch!I give it a 10 out of 10.  Go rent it, or better yet go buy it!  You won't regret it!",Null,140,180,6 March 2004
Fargo," Deserves so much more...
","Murder, money, and kidnapping. Doesn't sound like a Coen brothers'flick does it? Well, in this 1996 dramatic real life based film, the brothers give us all that and more.Waking up to a call early one winter morning, Margie (Frances Mcdermont), the chief of police in Brainard, MN, investigates a murder that's taken place not far out from her hometown. Back in the twin cities, the planner, kidnappers, and basis for the entire doings of the calamity, are underway and about to take shape before the audience's very eyes.A dramatic, well-written, and very realistic portrayal of six murders, in the span of just a matter of days, is spellbinding and a very intense piece.The actors that are most noteworthy are, Frances McDormant, William H. Macy and Steve Bushemi. Each one, has a specific character, that will make you feel for each of them in your own way, including other unmentioned such characters.A very character driven film, it's the best Coen brothers film I have ever seen, and recommend it to every person who enjoys good, intense murder mysteries.",10,0,2,4 January 2006
Notting Hill," One of the most enjoyable romances ever
","You'll find, that with most British comedies, there's a lot of wit, that they carry, which will be lost of most people. However, this is one of those unique little gems, that everyone can have the pleasure of enjoying and partaking in.Although it's not my favorite Julia Roberts movie, it's my second favorite. 'Steel Magnolias' is a film, I will forever carry a special place in my heart, however, this comes as a close second. Hugh Grant gives a typical, gorgeous, and average performance, as an average Joe who falls in love with someone, not within his reach...but somehow is.I would recommend this film to everyone and anyone. If you love light romantic comedies, than this is where you want to be...'Notting Hill'. It's a fun, flirtatious little movie, that keeps you in store for laughs, tears (depending on how emotional you tend to get with films like these), and plenty of embarrassments. It's a great film that deserves all the credibility and recognition that it has already received...and then some.Don't pass this film up. It's one of the greatest romances of all time, and will stay a favorite of mine for a long time to come. A keeper, and definitely an excellent 10!",10,5,5,5 July 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Heart stopping
","There are few films out there that can really scare me, but this is definitely one of them, now. You may find that the first thirty minutes of this film are quite; slow, boring or uneventful; but the moment the film picks up - it never stops. Truth be told, I had to turn it off twice to catch my breath. It was too much at times, and I seriously considered not finishing it, because it was so disturbing and realistic. That's not to say that I think there really are mutants living out in the New Mexico deserts, however the way that the first 'scary scene' is filmed, it is terrifying, and well - horrific.The setup is a family traveling to California, via the New Mexico plain terrain. They come across a random gas station to fill up their tank, and the attendant, a bit shifty, suggests that in order for their journey to go a bit more quickly, they should take a short cut. They take his advice, and end up running into some car trouble later down the road. Miles from civilization, their car is now broken and two of the men decide to split up and walk to the nearest town or rest stop for help. Three women, a teenage boy and a newborn baby stay behind. Nightfall comes, and so does the terror of the film, which does not cease until the credits roll.It is without a doubt one of the best, and most disturbing horror movies I've ever seen. It leaves you feeling violated, uneasy and uncomfortable to sleep without the lights on. I recommend it to those horror fanatics out there (like me), and those who can appreciate good cinema like this. It may leave a knot in your stomach, or a nawing at your brain - but if nothing else, it will totally scare you.",9,0,2,5 December 2006
American Beauty," By far and away a classic
","There are few films that you will run across in your lifetime that match up to the genius, humor and real touching drama that this film has to offer. It's honest, poignant and real. At times funny, it still maintains a dark humor, that can be taken lightly or dramatically.Mena Suvari, while in the beginning, you may not see the attraction to why she was chosen for the role of the 'American Beauty', halfway into the film, you really begin to see why she was picked for the part. She is outstanding, as is everyone, especially Chris Cooper, in his portrayal of a ex-military soldier, sure of keeping his eighteen year old son in line.While the film tackles a lot of issues that some might find, offensive or grosse, I find the movie to always be genuinely entertaining and thoughtful. It's an interesting film that will always keep you waiting for the next scene, surprise and line.Annette Benning, rightly nominated for her role as the wife of a man who's gone completely numb from living with her for two decades, is at her very best in this movie. She is so convincing that there are times when it's hard to remember it's only a film that we're viewing. However, this being said, that almost all of the actors in this piece were phenomenal, the one person I think is almost out of place was Thora Birtch. Her role as the daughter of Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning, isn't as convincing as some of the other characters, and quite frankly could have been played better by another actress.Allison Janney was remarkable as the wife of Chris Cooper, and it always disappoints me that she has such a small role in the film. She usually is casted in comedies, and is a hilarious comedianne, however, in this piece she plays an almost mental case, hardly ever talking and when she does it's done brilliantly.The direction is outstanding, and the writing very precise. The music is perfect for the film, especially at dark moments, when the music gets deeper and more threatening. Those are the best parts of the film.The costumes and set design were right on, and very applicable to the film and what it required.It's honestly quite rare that I find a film I have no complaints about, and this is one of them. This film is a definite 10/10 simply because it's perfect. There is nothing in this film that I would change. I would highly recommend it. Baring in mind that it does contain a lot of subject matter and nudity that may not be appropriate for all ages.But, check it out. It's a terrific movie, and an all time great classic, that everyone should see. It's no wonder it won best picture, because it really is just that.",10,0,1,4 June 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the all time greatest sci-fi movies
","Even after fifteen years since the film came out, the special effects, and intensity still roar and excite to this day.Arnold Swartzenagger leads the cast in a brilliant tale of futuristic cyborgs, and robots sent from the future to terminate in the past.If you've seen the first film, then you'll be able to follow the sequel much better, but to be honest, you don't really need to see either the first or third to follow this one. And, quite frankly this is the best of the three. I'm not really much for science fiction, but this is one of the few that I really do enjoy. Robert Patrick gives a chilling performance as the 'bad' robot sent to destroy John Connor (Edward Furlong), and terminate T-1000 (Swarzenagger), who is ironically there to protect the son of the woman he was sent to kill in the last film.The whole film is almost non-stop intense, and there are times when you're heart will jump out of your chest, because it gets so nerve racking.Edward Furlong, in his debut role, gives an amazing performance as the son of Sarah Connor, and the leader of the future.I would give it a 10, however, there are times when the movie tends to slow down, for long periods of time and can get a bit boring. However, the rest of the time it's nothing but thrills and nerves at your doorstep, for an entertaining ride in the future, past and present. A great sci-fi film, that will never let you down.",9,7,10,16 May 2006
Van Helsing," Disappointing...
","I just saw this film recently and I was sadly disappointed.  The previews made it appear as though it would a non-stop suspense/horror roller coaster ride, however it wasn't at all. I'll make this as brief as I can by just getting to the point.  The first scene of the movie was the best more than assuredly, and when that scene ended I was excited hoping that the rest of the film would be just as terrific, unfortunately I was going to be let down.  And by the end of the first half hour, I was trying to read my watch in the dark wondering when this movie would finally end so that we could all be released from the pain and misery of such a horrible piece.  Obviously the writing was the worst part of it.  There was just no story to it.  It would have also been nice had Hugh Jackman had personality. When our hero first arrives at the beginning of the movie, I thought to myself, 'Oh yea, Hugh Jackman's in this.'  Which was fine, however it's not fine when you continually do this throughout the entire film.  Every time he spoke or made somewhat of a action that was more than drab, I reminded myself that not only was he actually in the movie, but he was also the start.  Not a good thing.The directing was outstanding and it was some of the most incredible CG I've ever seen, but there were so many elements missing in the film and story. They never developed any of the characters, and the monsters just weren't scary enough I think for one main reason.  They didn't wait long enough in between 'scary moments' to let you catch your breath and not expect to see them again, they just sort of kept showing up.A couple more things to that I'd like to add to this, was it just me, or did Frankenstein's monster resemble Peter Boyle (see: 'Young Frankenstein')? And didn't Egor look like Ted Danson just a little too much?  Just a thought.The girl was probably the best in the movie next to Egor, who I sort of had sympathy for, is that right, by the way?  But overall this movie really sucked in my opinion.  I paid 3 bucks to go see this, and in my opinion I overpaid by $2.75.  So, if you wanna see it go for it, if you're hoping for great special effects and a lot of bad dialogue and no story you're definitely in for a treat, otherwise don't bother.I give it a 2.5 out of 10 and that's being kind.",Null,0,1,1 July 2004
Save the Last Dance," Horrible!!
","Possibly the worst movie Julia Stiles has ever made.  She's not bad in the movie, although she could have been better, and even more to the point, they probably could have casted someone better than her in it.The script should have been looked over a few more times before they actually went into production, and the plot was so distressing and horrible, that I wanted to cry because of what a bad movie this was. Sean Patrick Thomas, was really good and I thought that he did do a very convincing job in the film (but on the other hand, how hard was his character?).  Stiles really needs to find better work than this.  I really didn't like the transformation her character made from the beginning of the movie to the end of it.  To me, she got worse not better by the end of the film, and she was supposed to seem 'helped'?I give the movie a 3.5 out of 10.  Some good scenes, boring parts with dancing, horrible script, trashy sexual sequences and not at all very realistic.  But...if you like to watch freak dancing, be my guest.  You'll enjoy it thoroughly in that case. But for real Stiles fans, don't get your hopes up for anything spectacular.",Null,3,5,6 March 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," One of those happy endings...
","I'm not about to go ga-ga over this film, even though I appreciated the ending. It's not a film that I would recommend to anyone, even those who find the stupidest of comedies amusing, because it's not even one of those. I found the film to be slow, and really unfunny at times. Although, the moments that were entertaining, had you in a midst of non-stop laughter. But, there was no force behind it. Steve Carrell, although portraying his part really well, and quite realistic (but, let's face it. How hard could it actually be to play a virgin?), he didn't have enough physical or written comedy in the script. The film is about a forty-year old man, who lives alone, collecting action figurines and works at an electronic store. He has never had sex, and after a lot of persuading by his male co-workers, he has decided to give casual sex a try. The next 90 minutes of the film, are dumb, and full of crazy little adventures that the poor man has to go through in order to 'get some'. I will admit, that there comes a point in the film, where you just want the guy to get it over with already and just have sex. But, you know that it's not that easy, and you wouldn't have rented a film like this, if it were. I found Paul Rudd, exceptionally funny in this film, since I've really only seen him in a couple of previous films, including 'Clueless'.The zany ideas that go on in the film, are a bit ridiculous at times, and you find yourself waiting for the punch line, or in this case the end, to see what we've waited for the entire 116 minutes to find out.The end is of course, sweet and cute, and in my opinion was written for all the sentimental girlie girls out there, like me, who like sweet and cute endings like these. Cathrine Keener is also very good, and very funny as she usually is. I love Catherine Keener, but what I like the most about her in this movie, is that she's not gorgeous, but quite real, and maybe not an average woman, but certainly not a playboy centerfold, which is what most leading ladies in these sort of films tend to personify. The acting was good, the directing was fine, but the script could have been a little bit juicier and more full of jokes. It lacked something, and although I would have no objection to watching it someday again, it's not a film that I will add to my collection.The funniest line in the film, if I may quote, is when all the men are talking about the women that they've 'done', and when it comes to Andy (Carrell), he's describing a woman's breast, and it's one of the funniest moments in the film. 'I love breasts. Yeah. They're like, bags of sand.'",4,3,7,4 June 2006
Collateral," Very intense
","Having seen this film twice now, I still feel tense even knowing what's going to happen.Tom Cruise plays a professional hit-man, who hails a cab one night with a driver who has no idea, how much his night is about to change.Both actors get equal time on screen, and both give outstanding performances. Jamie Foxx, was nominated for his role in this, and rightly so, however, I felt that Tom Cruise was just as good, if not better in his portrayal of a killer, and should have been nominated too.The writing is excellent, the intensity factor is way up there, and the acting is terrific. Mark Ruffalo, is also a co-star in this, and did an excellent job too.It's a definite watch, maybe even a good DVD to own. It's a great flick, so check it out.",9,1,3,17 January 2006
The Machinist," Excellent!
","I was so excited when I found out about this film, that I ran down to the video store and rented it immediately. I was sure pleased after viewing it. It's one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. Christian Bale was outstanding in his performance, and everyone else involved in the film should win ten awards each for the work that they all did. It was an amazing movie.Trevor (Bale) is suffering from insomnia. He hasn't slept in one year. His weight is down to 119 pounds and he's over six feet tall. His job is the pits, and he works as a machinist at an industrial work factory. His apartment is dark and dreary (but this is actually a running theme in the movie.), and he has no real life. Suddenly, that all changes. Strange things start occurring, and we're never quite sure if this is real, or if he himself is just imagining all of it, from lack of sleep.I had to stop the movie twice, because I got so nervous and was so tense from watching it. There were times, when I thought I was going to end up having nightmares, because some of the scenes were so realistic and psychologically nerve-wrenching! I could go on and on about how much I adore this movie. I'm ready to own it now, and I recommend it to anyone over 18 who loves thrillers like this, and can handle a little bit of disturbing aspects in film.",10,2,3,3 February 2006
Batman Begins," I've seen better...
","I have to sadly admit, I was quite disappointed with this film. I was expecting something dark and more interesting like the first two 'Batman'. Although this was a well made film, there were certain elements that just didn't live up to the same level the other films have in the past. I will say, that as good looking and as talented as Christian Bale is, there was something about him, when he played Batman, that didn't work as well as some of the other actors that have played him in the past. Michael Keaton, was by far and away the best person to play Batman ever in my opinion, and it seems to me that if they keep making these 'Batman' movies, it's going to turn into a James Bond series soon. The worst choice for any of the characters, I felt, was Katie Holmes. I like Katie as much as the next person, and she is undoubtedly very beautiful to look at, however, it seems hard to picture her as a D.A. at such a young age, when she was still just hanging out with Dawson on the creek. She was too young to play the role, and not right for the part. Someone, who I thought would have fit the role better, would have been Maggie Gyllanhall.Michael Cain was good, however, his character certainly aged dramatically by the next film, if we're meant to believe this film preludes the very first 'Batman' with Jack Nicholson.Morgan Freeman, did a fine job as well, however, for someone so famous, he sure did have a small part. It seemed almost a waste to have him in the film.But, the best-looking and one of the best actors in the film was Cillian Murphy. You might have missed him in some of his other unpopular work, however, if you saw 'Red Eye', that's where he made his mark. He was very devious and in a way it was hard to hate him, since he was so good-looking. In a way...he should have played Batman. Then again, maybe not.All in all it was a good film, just not a good 'Batman' film. It would have been better had it been a different superhero. Although I'm sure some of you will desperately disagree with me, I just found it a bit flat. But, it's very clean, with some violence, and as I recall no language. I would recommend it, as an action family film.",5,0,3,21 January 2006
28 Days Later...," Worst $8.50 I ever spent...
","So, here's an idea.  Let's actually make a movie that scares you or keeps you tense and hire some people who can actually act in our movie. None of these things were in this movie.  I can honestly say that next to 'Vanilla Sky' and 'Bring It On' this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and ironically I saw all three in the theater.  I have said before in other reviews that horror is my favorite genre, and as an expert in that field, I can say with all certainty that this movie was no horror.  Perhaps grosse at times, but not scary and certainly not intense.  I went with a large group of people, and while all the girls were hiding their faces and covering them in the boys' shirts, whilest the guys were on their edge of their seats hurraying and applauding how good it was, I was the only one sitting there yawning and closing my eyes, only because I was bored hoping the movie would end soon so that I could leave the theater. It was boring, and a waste of time and definitely money.  I know it was a huge success, in Europe and America, but I despised it. No interesting plot, the fact that older men wanted to have sex with a little girl disgusted me, and I really didn't care to see the lead character exposed full frontal constantly.If you want my advice, don't see this film.  Save your money and see a good horror like 'Nightmare' or 'Scream'.  Stuff you can count on to give you a good plot or storyline.I give this movie 1/2 out of 10 for actually making it to the theater instead of direct to video.  And that's being kind.This is the end of my review.",Null,1,2,10 February 2004
School of Rock," VERY not good...
","I should have listened to the advice of a friend, who have after seeing this said, 'Don't waste your time.' Unfortunately today, I did. Although there are a few parts that may make you smile or laugh, they are few and far between and not worth the rental fee. I am so glad I didn't see this in the theater, otherwise I would have written a letter of complaint to ask for my money back from the producers of the movie.Jack Black was good, but even for a him, a bit over the top. Joan Cusack was really the only good actress in the film, and in a way she should have been considered for at least a golden globe. Granted, this isn't the kind of film you would normally see an award coming to, this specific area of the movie, would be the only one I would support its giving.The movie itself is definitely a kid's film, and I would recommend it to anyone seven and up. It's not a movie for adults, and the only reason why anyone older than thirteen may want to see it, is because of Jack Black and possibly Joan Cusack. Otherwise, it's most certainly geared toward kids. There was only one thing that I was actually bothered by, and that's the fact that one of the little boys in the movie was gay. I disagree that they should be conditioning kids at such a young age, to that way of life, and suggesting that a little boy at ten years old would have an affectation of a feminine kind. It really bothered me, and although it was meant to be funny, I found it distasteful, and offensive. But, otherwise it's light enough and enjoyable enough for kids that it's worth a look. But, don't expect a 'Saving Silverman' or a 'Shallow Hal', because this is not even close to their caliber.",3,3,10,31 January 2006
Wimbledon," Love. It's not just a tennis term.
","There are very few romantic comedies that make me feel as good, as this one does. I saw it for the first time when it first came out in the theater, back in 2004, and today was the third time I've seen it. Though I've seen it that many times, it never loses its charm or warmth, that I've always seen in it.The thing about this movie, is that it's very professionally presented on screen. You see the career life, just as much if not more, than the romance part of these two characters' lives.Kiresten Dunst was perfectly chosen for this part, and although, off the top of my head, I don't recall seeing Paul Bettany in any other films, I thought he did a terrific job playing his character, perhaps more so than Dunst.The two really make you believe that they are tennis champions...and the film delivers there stardom and romance in a way that not only do you feel like you're apart of the relationship...but it also has an amazing way of making you feel like the fans and the audience watching them from a distance. It's brilliantly directed, perfectly casted, and excellently written.It's funny, witty, light, cute, romantic and sweet. All the things that make up a terrific romance. And, this won't be the last time I see it, either.Keep it in mind because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",10,1,1,6 August 2006
Dumb and Dumber," Funniest Farrley's Brother movie you will ever see...
","It's hard to find a Farrley's Brother which isn't funny, and this is even harder to classify as, 'not funny'...because it is the funniest!Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels team up as the not just odd, but strange, weird and mentally disabled couple. After losing both of their jobs on the same day, Lloyd (Carrey), who retrieved a bag which a woman he drove to the airport leaves in the terminal, encourages his friend Harry to come with him to Aspen where the girl flew to. They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill, but is actually the kidnappers of Mary (Holly)'s husband, who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.From their start in Rhode Island, until they arrive in Aspen, the kidnappers follow Harry (Daniels)and Lloyd, along the road. The script is the most well-written comedy I think ever, because every thing that they do in the movie, leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.Their are more than a few funny scenes, and the dialogue is always right-on.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Farrley Brothers' movies, or anyone who likes Jim Carrey. It's a hilarious comedy and the two stars were perfectly casted, especially Jim Carrey, of course.And now, an excerpt from the film, 'Skies, huh?' 'That's right.' 'They yers?' 'Yup.' 'Both of them?'",10,70,94,28 December 2005
8 Mile," Better than I thought...
","As much as people continually told me not to see this movie, just because it was so bad, I was bored and decided to give it a try.  Plus, I had really wanted to see Kim Basinger and Brittney Murphy in their roles, since those had been the only positive reviews I'd heard about the film.  But, I have to say that it was much better than I had aniticipated.Basic Plot: B. Rabbit (Eminem), is a kid on the 'wrong side of the tracks' and more appropriately, lives on the wrong side of 8 mile. Growing up in Detroit, MI, he is berated and harrassed from the black community (more correctly, the black gangs)about not being black and how he tries to act it.  However, with the support of his friends, and none from his mother (Basinger), he becomes stronger in the world of music and challenges himself, and his dreams.Basically it's a movie about Eminem's life story, only with a few fictional characters thrown into the process.  Murphy and Basinger are certainly more than noteworthy, and in fact, Basinger was so convincing as his mother, it's hard to believe she and Eminem had an affair in real life.  Brittney's role was amazingly carried out and I love her in everything that she does. Eminem, however, I couldn't quite figure some of his facial expressions out. He looks upset when he should be crying and he looks like he's going to cry when he's upset.  It confused me.  And his acting with regards to the rest of the film, was hard to determine whether it was good or not.  I mean, how hard is it to play yourself.  But, at any rate, I felt that he did a good job, whether he was playing himself or not.  At the very least, it's probably hard to remember what you did or how you acted when you were younger, so in that regard, I give him snaps for his efforts.So, with that said I give the movie a 7.5 out of 10.  Just because it was better than I thought it would be, and I liked the acting and all the music. Really well written script and music.And that's my review.",Null,0,0,23 February 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Flippin' awesome!
","I just saw this last night, and loved it! I was expecting something like, 'Jackie Brown', which I hated. Something, slow and dry and bloody, from what I'd heard of it. But, I was really surprised, and in a good way. The film leaves you guessing, and a little tense at times, and more importantly, hanging at the end! Uma Thurman and Lucy Lui, duke it out in this four-star blood bath dedicated to old Japenese and slaughter films. It's a definite Tarintino film, and it's hard not to recognize his determination to achieve a sickening result, that will leave you numb and grossed out from what you've just witnessed. But, that doesn't go without saying, that his talents almost supercede the acting abilities shown by Thurman and Lui. Both, learned Japenese to play the leading roles, and both obviously went in for some training, to be able to fight in certain scenes of the film.It's far too bloody for anyone under seventeen, and my recommendation is that you not eat before viewing. It's one of the most violent and bloody films, although I have to admit, there are some horror films which are a bit more disturbing and violent, this left me feeling just a little bored seeing all the killing. However, I still loved it.",8,1,3,18 January 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," Flippin' awesome!
","So, I already knew before I watched it that it had something to do with Vampires. But, by the time you get half way into the movie you completely forget about that, because you're so involved in the rest of the story. George Clooney gives probably his best performance as Seth, a robber and killer with his brother and side kick Richie played by Tarentino. The two hold up in a motel, and kidnap Harvey Keitel's family which includes Juliette Lewis as his daughter, for their motor home since the cops are looking for the two convicts.They reach the border to Mexico, and this is where the movie really begins.It turns from a con-man type film into something completely different. Really, really different. Basically it kind of turns into a horror movie. I loved it, and thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen. And, I can't wait to watch it again. I will however, not recommend this to anyone under the age of eighteen. It's pretty gruesome at times, and there's a lot of foul language, and graphic dialogue, not suitable for anyone under that age.But, for everyone else, check it out. Even if you're not normally used to watching horror films or slick-'em dice-'em type movies, you might actually like this one. It's pretty clever.",10,0,1,15 May 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Quite good!
","I will admit, that I was expecting a dark, dark film by Tim Burton, but was a little disappointed, and at the same time happy since it is a kid's movie, that it wasn't. Johnny Depp was outstanding, as always, and there were times when I found I had to remind myself that it was actually him, because he is so believable in every character that he portrays. I also don't think, I've ever seen a bad Depp film, and this one is included.Based on the novel, and the original film, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp now takes the lead in this quirky, unusual type family film. I was impressed with everyone involved with the film, especially the little girl that played Verusa. She was outstanding, and what I think I was most impressed with more than anything else, was how much like they were able to get two of the children to look just like two of the original children in the previous film.It was funny, and there were a few very touching scenes. I was obviously very impressed with Johnny Depp's performance, but then, when am I not? It was a great watch, and I recommend it to kids and adults of all ages, there is nothing in the film to be offended by, and even adults will enjoy it.",8,6,11,28 January 2006
Annie Hall," What's the big deal?
","Going into this, all I've ever heard about this movie, is that it's a classic, and one of the best films of all time, not to mention the best Woody Allen film. But, after having just seen it, I'm left with a sense of disappointment. It's not at all the sentimental journey I was expecting, and in fact I found it to be a little silly at times. And, although that's to be expected with any Allen film, I was anticipating something a little more sincere with this piece.Diane Keaton was very good in this, and I can see why so many people consider this to be her signature role, however you still see her has Diane Keaton, and not as the character Annie Hall. This, in my opinion was not her best role and she did not strike me as brilliant, as she did for me in 'Marvin's Room'. Woody Allen likes to write roles for himself, and instead of giving himself a character name in each of his films, he should just simply be called Woody, since he's always playing himself. He's a much better writer and director than he is actor, but I don't think I'm alone in this thought.The film itself is cute, and sweet, but it's nothing extraordinary. I would say that it's not bad, but then again, it's not terribly terrific either. I would recommend it, but not before a few of Allen's better films, such as; 'Everyone Says I Love You' and 'Manhatten Murder Mystery'.",5,9,18,9 April 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," Not worth your time.
","For some, I can see why this is a classic, however for me, not only did I find it painfully slow for the first forty minutes, but a little disgusting at times as well. It's more than definitely a guy movie, and would never even dare to be called a 'chick flick'.Robert De Niro was fine, however I think he tends to play the same role for every movie he's ever been in. Jennifer Connely was great, playing the young love interest of DeNiro's character, however again, is it really necessary to subject young children of that age to nudity? There were some sex scenes that could have been done without, and although they have been needed for the film, they still could have presented them a little more tactfully.I found it strange, to be honest, and I don't normally say that about dramas like these. I wouldn't recommend it. It's not worth your time.",2,10,28,9 May 2006
There's Something About Mary," Funnier than hell!
","I have to say that Dumb and Dumber is my favorite Farrley's brother movie, however this is VERY close second. It's funny when I think about the fact that Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller were actually in a romantic comedy together, but the truth is, they were both perfect for the roles that they played. There is something about Cameron, and she was made for this part.After a humiliating and basically unforgettable Prom night, when he was sixteen, Greg (Stiller) never fully recovers from the humiliation he suffered thirteen years earlier. He decides, that even though it's been several years, he'd like to look up the girl he essentially blew all of his chances with, so long ago.He hires a private detective to look into finding her, since Greg lives in Rhode Island, and Mary (Diaz) lives in Miami, FL. After finding her, and following her around, he falls in love with her too, and tells Greg that she is not worth his time and tries to get him to forget about her.Even though, Greg is discouraged he decides to look into finding her anyway. Along the way to Florida, he runs into some trouble with the law (which I won't give away, but the police scene is probably the funniest in the entire movie. For those who have seen the movie, I'm referring to the part with the two officers, who think he's done something other than what he thinks he's being charged for.), ans finally makes it to Florida.While he's there, Pat (Dillan), the P.I., learns of Greg's coming, and the two try to get one another out of Mary's life. With other mishaps, and funny situations that go on in the film, it's one of the most well-written scripts, and funniest films to watch ever.I recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy, however there is some pretty graphic dialogue from time to time, so I wouldn't suggest the film to anyone under seventeen. But, it is funny and I've seen it countless times. And now, an excerpt from the film: 'Greg, this wasn't your first time, was it?' 'No.' 'How many we talking' here?' 'My whole life? I dunno. Twenty-five, maybe fifty. I dunno, who keeps track? Look I know that this is like the Bible belt down here, but where I'm from this is not that big a deal.'",10,0,1,28 December 2005
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Better than the first...
","One of the funniest movies of all time.  What I really love about the first two Home Alone movies, is how funny they are and still have such heart at the end of the film.  There's always a warm, fuzzy feeling at the end of any John Hughe's movie (most of them anyway.). John Herd and Cathrine O'Hara did a great job in this film as they did in the first.  One of the best scenes is when she screams and then faints in the airport!  Classic comedy. And the best characters and best performances are definitely given by Daniel Stern and Joe Pescie.  They really make you hate them, since they're the bad guys.  And who can forget Tim Curry and Rob Shneider working in the Plaza hotel?  Next to Stern and Pescie, they're my favorite characters in the movie.  And they play them so well, it's hard to remember they're just acting.  Go watch it, seriously it's so funny! I give it a 10 out of 10.  One of my favorite movies!",Null,0,1,6 March 2004
From Hell," Better than I remember...
","So, I saw this movie right when it came out on video which was a couple of years ago (maybe only one), and I remember turning it off after the first thirty minutes, 'cause I thought it was really boring.  However, I watched it again today all the way through and really enjoyed it.  As bloody as some might think it is, it's really not that bad and I thought it portrayed the 1800s really well.Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual and you never think of him as Johnny Depp but as the role he's playing. I was surprised by Heather Grahamm just because she's usually playing the ditzy blond, but she was very believable and good in this role.Jack The Ripper did a fine job, and I'm sure the script stayed true to the book (although I have not yet read it.).I give the film an 8 out of 10 (10 being the highest). I enjoyed it quite a great deal, but it wasn't the best 'bloody' movie I've ever seen.  Get it?And that's my review.",Null,0,1,12 March 2004
Some Like It Hot," A classic that never lets you down
","Some may like it hot, but everyone loves this film. Whether you talk to someone who is a film connoisseur, or someone who adamantly hates old black and white movies, everyone loves, 'Some Like It Hot'. And, what's not to like? Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in drag, and the beautiful and multi-talented Marilyn Monroe. It doesn't get any better than that.While two out of work musicians lay witness to a murder in Chicago, they hear of an all girl band that needs two musicians that just happen to be the same type Lemmon and Curtis are. The two men disguise themselves as woman to avoid death from the mobsters they saw murder a man. They hop on a train bound for Florida, and plan to leave the band once they reach the warm state, but along the way the meet Ginger (Monroe), who they both fall for, but have to remain girlfriends with, so as not to blow their cover.It's a delightful little romantic comedy that's fun and appropriate for the whole family. A classic, and good fun.",8,1,2,8 April 2006
Pulp Fiction," Best Tarantino film you'll ever see...
","I know there are some of you out there, who really enjoyed, 'Jackie Brown', but for those like me, who found it dull and untentertaining as hell...then, you might like this much more. 'Fiction' is one of the most clever, well-written and well-casted films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.It's writing is so intuitive, and yet basic at the same time, that it's hard not to enjoy this film.Murder, guns, boxing 'dives', sex, drugs, and of course intense action, have you rustling for the remote to turn the volume up, so as not to miss a single syllable spoken by any of the characters. The editing and placement and timing of the scenes, is perfect and well-designed. John Travolta, although not as heart-throb-ish, as in 'Saturday Night Fever', was the only person who could have played this character. OK...maybe that's not true. I can think of several who would have been just as good, but he still has made this one of his many signature roles. His hair (which is the most unflattering you will ever see on him) and lethargic demeanor, and attitude give him the quality of performance that you will leave the film with a pleasant and humorous perspective. But, this is not only because of Travolta's work. There are many others in the film who give you the comic relief, including; Samuael L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, and Harvey Keitel. However, the dramatic and less jovial performance in the film, is that of Bruce Willis' character - who was my favorite in the film, as a matter of fact - in which he plays a boxer, payed to take a dive, but collects on the money before going down in the fifth round, and then, actually, killing the other player. Leaving the 'rough force' to follow after him, as he tries to make his escape. Tarantino, is not only an excellent writer (this film aside from all others he's ever done), and even more so an excellent director. I have so many favorite scenes and clips from the movie that are so good, but it would take to long to parlet, on just which ones are. I definitely do not recommend this film to anyone under eighteen, and remember that this is NOT a family film. If you want to watch this, make sure you do it WITHOUT the kids. However, it is a commendable film, and I think just about anyone who enjoys well-written comedy and stories, with an actual plot and point, will enjoy this piece.",10,0,1,5 January 2006
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Funny, but not the funniest...
","For originality and the fact that there were some funny lines, and I like the director, Guy Richie, that's why I'm giving it a five.The whole time proceeding my seeing this film, I was told by everyone that it was a must see and a fantastic film. A cult classic, some might even be so bold as to say, however I did not find it that enthralling. It was a movie made for guys, and although I will be hypocritical saying this since I love the average chick flick, it's not a film most women will probably like, since there was only one in the whole movie. The story is cleverly written, and definitely one you have to pay attention to, in order to follow what's going on.Again, the kind of humor that this is, I can totally see a bunch of guys roaring with laughter over, however my moments of smiles and giggles were few and far between. The writing was very good, and I as I said before, I love Guy Richie, so I loved the directing as well. But, I have to say that it's not the funniest, or even best underground Brit comedy I've ever seen. Better than 'The Full Monty', I will give it that much, but it's just not that good.All in all if you're a guy, you'll more than likely enjoy this movie, but ladies be forewarned, Man Clan film, and there aren't a lot of romantic scenes, actually none...so if you're the kind of person that's looking for a romantic comedy, you've rented the wrong film.",5,2,5,5 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," entertaining, but nothing more...
","If you're in the mood to watch two really good looking actors on screen, duke it out, in a funny way, with some really funny lines, and light humor, than check this movie out. However, if you're looking for something more clever, you're not going to find it here.This is a step up from a light romantic comedy, and definitely nothing more. You won't find a 'True Lies' or a 'The Mexican'. Nothing more than straight, mindless entertainment. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, although worked well together, there wasn't much chemistry between the two of them, which some might find ironic since they did end up having an affair together behind the scenes of shooting this production (no pun intended.). After six years of marriage in the movie, their relationship seemed like they'd been dating for less than a year. They didn't seem very comfortable with each other, and that made for a bad connection between the two of them.I will admit though, I was impressed with the cinematography, the wardrobe, locations, and direction. The whole movie was enjoyable to watch, but nothing more again, than something easy to kick back with where you really don't have to think much. There are no twists, nothing that you're not going to figure out within the first ten minutes of the movie, and no big surprises by the end of it.Brad Pitt was pretty to watch, and surprisingly really funny too, at times. Angelina Jolie stole most of the scenes with her beauty and amazing figure, and it was hard to keep your eyes off of her most of the time, which I'm sure were the intentions of the director and costume designer for Ms. Jolie.If pressed, though, it was a good movie and I liked it well enough to watch it again someday. But, not one that I'm going to go buy and put immediately in my collection of films. It's for most people, a one time watch. But, for some it may end up being a party movie.",7,0,1,10 February 2006
Wedding Crashers," Clever and funny
","For the first hour and a half were hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing, however watch out for that last half hour or so. It gets pretty slow towards the end, and a little mushy for the type of genre that it is.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaugn work surprisingly really well together, and although I've really grown to dislike Vaugn, I found him to be hilarious in this, and actually thought that he portrayed his character very well. Wilson as usual, was not only good looking, but hysterical and nailed every line to the 'T'. I was surprised to see Jane Seymore in a film like this, but then I was also surprised to see Christopher Walken except a part like this as well.I love Rachel McAdams, and so of course I was delighted to see her in the movie. The chemistry was really good between all of the cast members, and the set design, direction and writing were all excellent. But, again, the only reason why I don't give this movie a full ten is simply because of the ending. I felt it dragged on way too much for the comedy that was given earlier on in the film, and it made parts that should have been funny, more sentimental and corny. Which, is really hard to do with Vince Vaugn in my opinion.It's definitely the kind of movie you're gonna watch with your sweetie, but probably not one you'd dare watch as a first or second time date. There's some humor in it you might not want to chance with someone you don't know very well, but that's just my suggestion. I loved it, and will more than likely watch it again in the near future.",8,0,3,13 April 2006
Ice Age," Really funny for a kid's movie...
","From beginning to end I thought it was a really funny and good watch of a movie.  I've seen it twice now, and found it even funnier the second time through.  All the lead characters were hilarious, the lines wouldn't have been presented as well without the great comedians that did their voices. John Leguizamo and Denis Leary were superb!  Ray Romano was really good too, but the best lines and voices were - from Leguizamo and Leary.Ice Age is a sweet story for kids and a few double ant Andres for the adults.  Although, I'm not sure why they insist on throwing those in there. 
But overall it was a really enjoyable little Pixar movie (much better than Monsters, Inc.) and the CG was really something else. I give the movie (10 being the highest) a 7.  Great family movie, a little violence for the kids, funny for both them and the adults but a good story and obviously easy to follow.And that's my review.",Null,0,2,14 March 2004
The Terminal," One of the best films of the year
","It may not have done well at the box office, but this light romantic comedy, is more than that. In fact, I don't even think you could really call it a romantic comedy. It's more a drama about real life, and as far-fetched as it may seem as a realistic story, it could happen, and is cleverly told as a tale.Arriving at JFK one sunny afternoon, Viktor Navorski (Hanks), goes to the customs booth to get his passport stamped, so that he can enter the land of the free, and the home of the brave. Coming from a country which has been made up for the film, but is similar to an eastern Europe-Russian-Ukranian sort of a country, he does not speak more than a few words in English that he has written down to help him around town. He goes to the head of the airport's office, to speak to them, or more accurately to have them speak to him, and they tell him that because there is a war going on with his country, he does not 'exist'. Until the war in his country is resolved, they cannot allow him to enter the country, but they also cannot allow him to travel back to his homeland, either. He is a resident of the terminal, now. He is given food vouchers, but they can only last so long, and only has the luggage he's been carrying around and the clothes on his back.The story-line as I said, may sound unreasonably unrealistic, and it may even sound boring, but it is anything but. It is a beautiful piece of work. It will make you laugh, cry and touch your soul at certain parts. It is a human drama, that is not to be taken lightly. It is one of the best films I've ever had the privilege of seeing, and I don't think I could ever get tired of watching it.Cathrine Zeta-Jones co-leads with Tom Hanks, and plays the beautiful stewardess that he has fallen in love with. This is again, a romance, drama, comedy and human story. It should be given applauds for the imagination and cleverness that it carries, and everyone involved in the film, whether it be the cast, crew, director, writer or cinematographer, should be complimented on their work.I recommend to everyone. No one specifically, but everyone. It is an excellent movie, and can be seen with as much of the family as wanted. It's a beautiful movie, and will remain one of my favorites for a long time to come.",10,0,1,7 January 2006
Scream," What's your favorite scary movie...
","Mine's Scream.  I love this movie so much! I will never get tired of watching it.  My favorite genre is most definitely horror to begin with, and so for me this movie was perfect, because it's not the cheesy, Prom Night (which is ironically mentioned in this movie), that never scares you and all it's focused on is big breasts and naked girls in the locker room.  It's better than that...it actually has a plot and a story to it (contrary to what Scary Movie may say about it.).  Neve Campbell, in my opinion is one of the worst actresses to ever hit the movie screen, and they could have done a lot better casting for her role.  Matthew Lillard is gorgeous and I want him, although all the other girls seem to have a thing for Skeet Ulrich, who was very good in the movie, but not really the cutest guy who could have played, Billy.  Rose McGowen was extremely funny and although I don't care for her in real life she did a fantastic job in this film and should receive more credit for it. Courtney Cox is also probably one of my favorite characters in this.  She's so funny and she's not even supossed to be.  The anamosity between her and her cameraman is laugh out loud hysterical most times and the friction between her and Neve, and the sexual tension between her and David Arquette is hilarious in itself as well.The inside stuff is the best part too.  There are so many things that I still pick up when I'm watching it.  For instance, one of the last scenes of the movie, Jamie Kennedy is sitting on a couch watching Holloween with Jamie Lee Curtis, and while the killer is standing behind him, he's saying aloud to himself, 'Look behind you, Jamie, behind you!'  It's pretty funny stuff.Great lines and humor while the first time you see it, if you're not used to these Teen Screams, may be scary, but after the first time it's just like watching a comedy. Not a You've Got Mail, thank God, but definitely lighter than some horror movies. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and can't wait to see it again!That is the end of my review.",Null,0,0,10 February 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," Outstanding, even by today's standards
","I've seen this film countless times, and it is still riveting each time. There are times that you feel nothing but the deepest sympathy for the protagonist, and other moments when you want nothing more than to see what just might happen to her.Jodie Foster is a trainee at the headquarters in Washington D.C. for the F.B.I. Clarice Starling (Foster), has been asked to question Dr. Hannibal Lector, a prisoner at an insane isilum for help on a murder case the F.B.I. has been investigating. Hannibal (Hopkins), agrees to help her solve the case, if in return she tell him personal information about herself. The murder that they are investigating is a serial killer who has been kidnapping heavier set woman, in order to skin them. Throughout the course of the film, you will go inside the mind of a psychopath, a serial killer and a woman trying to save her mind from all the chaos that is tangeled in between the story.I will never get tired of this movie, and it was one of the few out there that not only deserved each and every Oscar that it received, but still a movie that can creep you out even after seeing it a hundred times. It's a classic and will remain that way for a long time to come.",10,1,1,13 February 2006
Vanilla Sky," Not one of Crowe's best pieces...
","I was sorely disappointed when I saw this film two and a half years ago.  I actually went to the theater to see this.  I'm so glad I wasn't the one paying.  I love Cameron Crowe and I think he is a very talented writer/director, but this is one of the worst pieces of film in the history of cinema.  I couldn't believe it.  And it's really ironic, I would have to say that it's my least favorite movie of all time (that and 28 days later...that I did pay to see, big mistake!), and Noah Taylor is in this, yet he's also in my all time favorite movie, The Year My Voice Broke.  Tom Cruise was very good, and so were all of the actors and actresses, that I did not have a problem with.  To be honest most of the movie I don't even remember, it confused me then, and to think back on it now, I can't even put it together.  When I went to see it, after it was over, a lady sitting next to me and the person I was with asked, 'Did you understand what just happened?  'Cause I sure didn't.' Yea, it was a real mind-numbing experience.  And towards the end of the film, just when I thought I knew what was going on, they mixed everything up, and I was lost again. Random sex scenes, that didn't make any sense, and confusing dialogue, coincided with a really slow beginning. I hated this movie, and it's no exaggeration. But if you really want to see a bad movie, you should check it out.I give this movie a 2 out of 10 for effort, and that's being kind.That's the end of my review.",Null,0,1,10 February 2004
Before Sunrise," Surprisingly awesome...
","What a great movie. I mean, really surprised me. I was expecting your typical predictable 'You've Got Mail' kind of movie, which I hate, because I had no idea what it was about or what to expect. Completely and utterly wrong, was I.The movie, set in Europe, which I can tell you from having been there enough times, was completely realistic, and the directing was extraordinary. One of the best directed films I've ever seen. I loved it for so many different reasons. 1. It was the kind of story that I can honestly imagine to come true and be real. 2. The directing was incredible, including cinematography 3. The acting was amazing, it really proved what a terrific actor Ethan Hawk is, and actress Julie Delpy is. I could list a ton of other reasons why I loved the film...but the list is just far too long.But if you like romance films, you'll certainly like this one... it brings a mistiness to your eye, and leaves you sad and anxious to find out what happens next.A 10 most definitely!",10,4,7,13 February 2005
Identity," Who else is confused...?
","Great movie, great script, great acting, great directing, where's the plot? And how about an explanation for what just happened?  There was a lot of blood.  For what?  I guess I was lost.  Someone told me that it was a psychological thriller, and more to the point, just a movie, and so you can't truly get it....but tell me!  Seriously, the movie had me all excited to finally figure out what the purpose for all the killing and clues, for what?  I guess I'm just venting, because they led me up for something I thought would be a great ending, and it turned out I got jipped.  I'm so glad I didn't go pay to see this, although in all honesty I liked the movie a lot, it was just that the last fifteen minutes made me really angry.John Cusack and Ray Liota are so good in this movie I want to scream. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but they really were very good. I was extremely impressed with Amanda Peet as well.  She always seemed like a bit of a light weight to me in most of her roles, but she did a really good job in this one (except that her accent tended to fade in and out at times.  Where was she supposed to be from again?  Florida, living in Nevada with a Tennessee accent?).And finally, Clea DuVall.  She is such an underrated actress, I can't believe how few widely known films she's actually done.  You may remember her from The Faculty, with Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood.  One of her bigger roles.  Or how about the stuck up teen painter from She's All That, that tries to convince Cook's character to kill herself? She was also in The Astronaut's Wife, she played Charlize Theron's sister. She's been doing these small roles for a while now, and you can really see her raw talent in this movie.  I love her!  She should do so many more movies, and I think she was one of the best actresses/actors in this film. She really helped make it work.  Without her (granted it still probably would have been a good movie, but) it wouldn't have been the same.I give this movie, 10 being the highest a 7.5.  Just 'cause it p***ed me off that they didn't do as good a job explaining the ending as they should have. I hate it when they do that.  But, it was a good story overall and a really good watch. There's some blood, a head here and there, and more than one car accident (I.E. people get killed in this movie beware.), so if you don't like those kinds of films, and because you see John Cusack on the cover and think 'America's Sweethearts', think again...it 'aint the sequel to that. And Michael Douglas' sweetheart 'aint in this one either.And that's my review.",Null,1,2,11 March 2004
Munich," Not Spielberg's best piece.
","While the first half of this movie is simply magnificent, and keeps your heart rate at all time high, by the end of the second half, you're ready for the film to be over. The last half of the film is slow, and boring. It really covers too much information, that we could have surmised on our own without having to be shown or told. Spielberg always captivates audiences, and you might find that since this is also a film based on true events, it's very similar to 'Catch Me If You Can', which he filmed in 2002. Not that the stories are similar at all, but the way it's filmed, is in a lot of ways, almost exactly the same.I was so impressed however, with the cinematography and how Spielberg was able to make it look like it was actually filmed in the 1970s.If you don't know the story, you might get confused at times. I knew the story going into the film, and I was still confused. It's not the best Spielberg film for two reasons. That's one, and the other is that it's far too long. Like most of his films, he likes to take his time setting up the story before he gets into the actual movie, however, sometimes that's not always necessary. Sometimes, you can have a great film without going into a lot of detail. We're not reading a book here. This is a visual art form of story-telling, and so sometimes small details are not always necessary. Eric Bana was excellent, and he resembled Christian Bale so much in this film, at times I thought it was the 'Batman' actor. All of the actors in the film were great, especially the team that's sent to assassinate the assassinators. A little bit of life's ironies are thrown into play, which also makes the film that much more realistic, as well as the times when you don't know exactly what's going to happen, to whom, or when.There were times of pure tension, and other times of pure boredom. But, I think it works well for the most part, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film (at least the first half), and I would definitely recommend it to those who want to see what really happened in 1972-73. It's an amazing story. And, it just goes to show what people do to back their own.",7,1,2,27 June 2006
Shall We Dance," Good, but not the original.
","If you're looking for a film that you can zone out to, feel good about by the end of it, and really feel like you're dancing along with Richard Gere's character throughout the entirety of the movie, than this is the right place for you to be. A simple, light-hearted romantic (in the sense of whimsical) getaway from reality, that I'm sure more than a few hard-working Americans can relate to, who go to there nine to five jobs each and every day.There a few problems with this film, however. First of all, Jennifer Lopez. She's good...but...let's consider this. If you've seen the original (which btw, was much better than this remake), you know that it was an Asian film, and so the girl that was casted was obviously Asian. To cast, the Latino, big-bootied J-Lo, is a bit of a stretch considering that their charisma is completely different. The other problem I found, was that although it's been a while since I've seen the original, as I recall it was more of a drama, rather than a comedy, and though this isn't hysterical every moment, the remake pokes fun at a lot of what the original movie's purpose was, and this is just more comical at times, than I think it should be.All in all it's an enjoyable film, and I greatly enjoy Susane Surandon the most in the movie. I think her performance in the role as Richard Gere's wife, is achieved with brilliance, as so many of her roles are.Again, if you're looking for something very light, this is your best bet. Enjoy it, though if you're trying to decide between this and the original, stick with the first, it's much better and more realistic.",6,1,2,16 September 2006
Coach Carter," Inspirational and moving...
","Samuael L. Jackson, once again brings a performance to the screen, like no one else could.Richmond,CA. 1999. In a mess of a city, a high school basketball team is on a continues losing streak with a poor coach. Soon, however these kids with bad attitudes, failing grades, no goals or aspirations, and no future, are turned around, by a man who believed in them more than they did themselves.I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it and just had the pleasure of seeing it again, and cannot say enough words about how much I enjoyed the film. It was; well casted, well acted, well directed, well written and well located. It is one of the best films, based on actual events, you will ever see, and may even bring a tear to your eye, or a hope in your heart, about how wonderful life can be with just the right people or person in it. I recommend it to anyone, and although there is some crude language and sexual content, it is well overlooked, to still be the kind of film that should be played in schools.",9,0,0,16 January 2006
True Romance," Excellent; funny, sweet, romantic, intense and hot!
","This film has to be one of the best films that came out in the 1990's. It has everything an audience could ask for; murder, action, romance, sex, comedy, drama and a great story behind it!Quite possibly my new favorite (written-by) Quintin Tarintino film. I can't actually tell you what the film is about without ruining it, but let's just say, it's excellent. It's not a chick flick or a guy movie, it's a little bit of both...but enough of each so that everyone can enjoy.I'm really excited about this film, because it's so cleverly written, with quite a bit of honesty and reality thrown into it, that you can enjoy it without getting frustrated from the unrealisticness of some parts, or the intensity of some of the other scenes. The acting was outstanding, and let's face it Christian Slater is not too ugly to watch in a movie, and Patricia Arquette's breasts had top billing above her name I think. But, she herself was amazing. I don't know if she was nominated for this role, but she should have been, because she was excellent. Probably the best character and actor in the whole movie. A lot stars are in this before they were 'stars' including; Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Michael Rappaport, Bronson Pinchot, and James Gandalfini.I recommend this film to everyone! It's an awesome movie, but mind the rating. It's rated the way it is for a reason. There is some violence and some nudity and sexual content that might not be suitable for some.I hope everyone takes a look...I'm adding it to my collection!",10,5,6,8 February 2006
The Breakfast Club," My favorite '80s teen movie...
","How can five kids who don't have anything in common at the start of a day have almost everything in common by the end of it? The Breakfast Club is so moving and such a true example of the incredible writing style John Hughes always delivers.  Anthony Michael Hall and Molly Ringwald return from Sixteen Candles together in this well thought out script about what would happen to five kids who are all 180 degrees different from one another, by the end of a day of detention with each other.  Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, and Judd Nelson join the other two actors in this heart-felt classic, aimed at teens but great to watch even as you get older.  Out of all the Hughes films that came out in the '80s, even throughout the early '90s, this is probably my favorite.  Although it's hard to turn that slot down to Ferris Beuller's Day Off and Sixteen Candles. It's a funny, sad and true depiction of how high school can really be, and the ending more hollywood than real life, is still really great, and I feel for each of the characters every time I see the movie.  I love it, and hope that everyone who is in high school or has faced the same trials and tribulations as these kids have, should watch it. I give it a 10 out of 10.  A classic and will stay that way in all of motion picture history.",Null,0,1,10 February 2004
Donnie Darko," My new favorite movie!
","In the last month, I have seen this movie three times.  It is one of the best movies I've ever watched and definitely my favorite movie that has come out within the last five years.  It's wonderful!  I think that it is not only realistic (in the emotional anxiety the lead character suffers from), but also because it really shows how people can hide their true feelings and keep a smile on their faces, even when they're really feeling like crap on the inside.  Everyone in this movie did such a terrific job.  The only person I felt was not suitable for her role was Jena Malone.  She was great in Stepmom, but not right for this character she tried to portray. However, the lead, Jake Gyllanhaal, really shined.  I have only seen him in two other roles, the first of the two others was, Moonlight Mile, and The Good Girl, in which he also plays a little mentally disturbed. And being an avid Drew Barrymore fan, I felt that this was the best role she had ever been in, as small as it may have been. I was also surprised to learn that she was one of the executive producers to the film.All in all it was a great watch, and I can't wait to watch it with more people to see what their reactions will be.  And in case you don't already know it, a fun piece of trivia is that Jake's sister in the movie, is his real sister in real life too.  Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze were the other two small characters in the film and I thought they were really good.  I'm not a big fan of Swayze's but I thought this was the best role I'd ever seen him in as well. I also thought that the woman who played the annoying teacher, Ms. Farmer, was really good.  She made you hate her so much and she was really good in her role.  She really became her character.Weird, bizzare, and confusing might describe this movie for some, but for me it was beautiful, interesting, funny and really well written and directed.  The construction of the movie was intricate and  unusually put together nicely for such a confusing structure of a story.  Again, I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and hope to hear anyone else's thoughts on the piece.  A definite 10 out of 10.And that's the end of my review.",Null,1,2,10 February 2004
Cinderella Man," Touching..
","While some may say that this film is more depressing, than anything else, I found it uplifting. It's the struggle of one poor family in the 1930's during the Great Depression, trying to find hope through one man's dreams.Based on true events, the story of James (Crowe), circles around his family; his wife and three small children, during tough times in American economy. His dream is to be able to box, and while having broken his hand earlier on in the story, and find scarce work, it seems as though his hope for his family's lives and his own, is barely worth holding on to. But, through the help of a friend, and a lot of belief in himself, tragedy turns into fairy tale, and the rest is the making of an amazing film and true story.Renee Zellwiger was great as usual, and Paul Giamanti was terrific as well, as he always is in character-driven roles such as these. And, although I'm not a Russel Crowe fan, I was very impressed with his work in this film. He was very real, and his accent was amazing for an Australian.During the whole movie, it sort of reminded me in the tiniest way of 'Far and Away' the early 1990's movie with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, and it came as no surprise why, when the credits ran at the end of this picture, that it had been a Ron Howard film, who also did 'Away'. It had the same feel and appearance and sort of the same theme (boxing) as the other film had.I found the whole movie to be quite enjoyable and well told. I recommend it to anyone over fourteen, for the strong violence.",8,0,1,14 February 2006
Jurassic Park," Outstanding
","Quite possibly one of the best films of all time, and one of the best directorial performances of all time, 'Jurassic Park', is a film that will go down in history as nothing short of a masterpiece. Stephen Spielburg captures; fear, terror, intensity, nervousness, human instinct, and intellect in this action-pact film, that changed the face of scary in 1993. If you haven't seen the film, you need to. It's interesting, logical, and unrealistic as hell, but makes you feel like it could actually happen. I think everyone that loves the movie has seen it at least ten times. It's the kind of movie, you can sit at home and watch on a Friday night on your big screen, and crank the volume up with. It's loud, intense and blows you away at times. Even for it being thirteen years old, already, the creation of the dinosaurs in the film, still seem so realistic to me. I've never watched a film and not been able to see the strings...in this film, you really can't. It's very believable the way that it is presented, and strikes fear into the hearts of even the most apathetic and uninterested people.After leasing an island off Coasta Rica, Richard Attenborough's character sets up an amusement park of sorts, that's a little more detailed, and high class than what people are normally used to. He, along with three other doctors (A chaos expert, and two dinosaur bone diggers), and a lawyer, helicopter out to the island, to view the scientist's new theme park called, Jurrasic Park. The three doctors are there to determine whether or not, this park is safe and plausible for humans to enter. The two bone collectors are there merely to view it from an objective stand-point, but also to see for themselves what they've wanted to see since they were children. Along with the four adult audience goers, whom will be taking the tour of the park, are the scientist's two grandchildren. The five people, are now on their way for the greatest adventure of their lives. During the tour, the entire park system is shut down. There is a rain storm, it's at night, and the five passengers are all alone now in the Dinasours' wilderness. They have now become the prey. The film is scary and intense, and will keep you on the edge of your seat, after the first thirty minutes until the very end of the film. It's not a film I would recommend to anyone under thirteen, since it is pretty graphic, and might be strong for anyone under that age. It's otherwise very clean, and a good movie to watch with anyone. It has great scenes, and actually gives a good message in between chase scenes, that life is meant for the Creator, and not for humans to decide. I love the film, and it will remain a classic until the end of time.",10,2,3,30 January 2006
