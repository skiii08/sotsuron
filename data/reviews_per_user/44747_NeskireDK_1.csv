3:10 to Yuma," Generic and predictable
","I sat watching this movie, I had to finish it over 4 sit-downs because it kept offending the viewers intelligence and was drearily slow.The characters are deep and actors portray them well, but their individual actions and motivations are beyond fiction, simply terrible and out of character.Telling everybody involved the whole plan, destination and time is completely no-go and yet its the premise of the main story. They could have made a proper excuse for everyone involved knowing, like eavesdropping or the like. But nope, they just straight out tell it to everyone they know like the have a death wish. I'd be giving this movie a single star if not for the fact that it would ruin the legitimacy of my review.",4,1,3,3 July 2017
