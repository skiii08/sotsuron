The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Crap
","This 2008 film version of the 80's T.V Programme 'The Incredible Hulk' was and is absolutely crap. I hate Edward Norton and his acting as Bruce Banner was absolutely rubbish. They also got the name wrong in this film version of the original 80's T.V Programme. In the original 80's The Incredible Hulk, actor Bill Bixby played David Banner, but they got Edward Norton to act in this crap film and call his character Bruce Banner. This film doesn't even deserve or should have got a rating of 6.8 out of 10, it is a film which definitely is very cheesy. The Hulk in this film looks like a cheesy cartoon character, compared to the original Hulk which looked much more scarier. Definitely this film is very cheesy and is just absolutely rubbish. The film wasn't tense enough and before Bruce turned into the Hulk, it definitely wasn't scary or tense enough. I've got the DVD Box set of the original 80's T.V series The Incredible Hulk and the acting by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno is absolutely brilliant and is 1000000 times better than this 2008 cheesy film and the episodes in the original T.V series is also much better ad more awesome than this crap.",1,1,3,17 September 2017
The Longest Yard," Never seen an Adam Sandler film before but was impressed by this one
","The Longest Yard is an absolutely brilliant film which is very funny and entertaining and enjoyable to watch. The film which is about a man called Paul Crewe(played by Adam Sandler) who gets arrested and is put into Allenville Penitentiary one of the most cruelest prisons in the country. Whilst he is there an evil prison warden called Warden Hazen(played by James Cromwell) asks Crewe to form an American Football team to play against the prison guards. Crewe gets help from a Black guy called Caretaker(played by Chris Rock) to do this. With his help the two manage to form The Mean Machine one of the most craziest teams to ever play the game. Crewe is continuously pressurized about
the American Football team by the malicious warden Warden Hazen and gets one of the prison guards to kill Caretaker there and pins the murder of Caretaker on Crewe who has made friends, formed an American Football team and built a good friendship between him and Caretaker. When in an American Football game with the prison guards, the malicious and manipulative Warden Hazen wants Crewe to give up and let the prison guards win but that doesn't happen and when Crewes team wins the game, the malicious and manipulative Warden Hazen wants one of his prison guards to Kill Crewe who formed the team, but the prison guard refuses which makes the prisoners pour dirty water over Warden Hazen when winning the American Football game because Warden Hazen is a malicious and manipulative man who wants things all for himself. I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler but this film had some excellent acting by Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds, Nelly, Michael Irvin, Walter Williamson, Bill Goldberg, Terry Crews, Bob Sapp, Nicholas Turturro, Dalip Singh (aka WWE American Wrester The Great Khali), Lobo Sebastian, Joey Diaz, Steve Reevis, David Patrick Kelly, Edward Bunker, William Fichtner, Bill Romanowski, Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, Brian Bosworth and James Cromwell.",10,0,1,6 April 2019
Rocky V," Underrated and definitely better than Rocky IV
","Rocky V is a great film with excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Paulie, Sage Stallone as Rocky Jr, Tommy Morrison as Tommy 'Machine' Gunn and Richard Gant as the manipulative and malicious George Washington Duke. The fighter Tommy Gunn was a very powerful fighter with strong and very powerful punches and before the final fight against Rocky in the street at the last scene, Tommy Gunn came across as being a fearless and very powerful fighter with mixed personalities 1) a friendly guy, 2) A Cruel man who wants to betray a friend and think's he's the most dangerous man around. The tension in this film was there and there were some great flashbacks of Rockys past which made this film also dramatic and emotional. The fights in this film were awesome and were much better than the ones in Rocky IV.",8,1,2,1 September 2018
Ted," Don't give a damn about the stupid and negative reviews, this is hilarious
","Before watching this film I didn't know what it was going to be like or if it was crap, but I loved the film. Ted is a comedy which is not for all. It's more of an adult comedy even though it was rated 15, but it is hilarious and there was excellent acting by Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett, Mila Kunis as Lori Collins, Seth McFarlane as Ted, Joel McHale as Rex, Jessica Barth as the sexy Tami Lynn and Giovanni Ribisi and Aedin Mincks as the very evil Donny and Robert. Ribisis character Donny is a very evil man who wants Ted and Kidnaps Ted to give him to his evil son Robert played by Aedin Mincks. The film also featured a guest appearance by famous film actor Tom Skerritt. Ted is an enjoyable and entertaining film to watch and I loved watching it.",10,0,1,4 April 2019
Creed," Good but not better than that and definitely not good enough
","Creed (aka Rocky VII) is a film which is a good film but it definitely isn't In between good and very good or very good or In between very good and excellent and definitely isn't excellent. This film shouldn't have been made and it was completely unnecessary to have a Rocky VII. The character Adonis Johnson aka Adonis Creed also was a man who was a bit stubborn and just didn't listen to people who cared about him. In the beginning of the film when Adonis went to Apollo Creeds Boxing Gym and saw powerful boxers fighting, he asked a Black Guy with a big moustache if he will train him. The guy said no and told him so many times about the guys who box in the Gym he was at were professional experienced fighters and that people get killed, but Adonis ignored that and told the man again to train him and that he could fight well, but the man was firm and again said no which made Adonis leave that Boxing Gym. Adonis also didn't listen to his mother about Boxing and that it was very dangerous and that he didn't have to be like his father Apollo Creed, but again Adonis ignored his mum and didn't listen. When Rocky trained Adonis in the gym Adonis didn't listen to Rocky. When practicing to improve his strength, Adonis had to do some sparring against an opponent who was on his team but started using too much power when punching and Rocky had to tell Adonis to Stop doing it. The film did have some excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson, Tessa Thompson as Bianca, Phylicia Rashad as Mary Anne Creed, Tony Bellew as 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan and Andre Ward as Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler. The film wasn't intense like some of the Rocky films such as Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV or Rocky Balboa. The fight scenes were good but they could have been intense which they weren't. This film doesn't deserve 7.6/10 because besides it being a good film it also is very weak in places. Another that that I can't believe and is absolutely awful is that they're doing a Creed II(aka Rocky VIII), that it is coming out in the U.K on the 30th November 2018, this year and that it again is going to star Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago and Florian Munteanu as his son Viktor Drago and that Vikto Drago will fight against Adonis.",6,2,2,2 September 2018
Disturbia," Kale is my favourite green besides Spinach, but besides that this film is awesome
","Disturbia is a horror thriller about a boy named Kale Brecht(played by Shia LaBeouf) who after being involved in a car crash with his dad and survives but his dad dies, is saddened by his fathers death and finds it hard to focus on things in life such as his education. When he struggles to stay focused in class in High School because of the traumas of his fathers death, Kales teacher asks him questions, asks if he's done his homework, and then says ''what would your father think'', but because he's heartbroken and traumatised by the death of his father, Kale punches the teacher in the face. Kale ends up being put under house arrest which he finds is not comfortable. His mum Julie(played by Carrie-Anne Moss) is concerned about him, but he is disturbed and curious to know what's going on in his neighbourhood and what the neighbours are up to. He does this by using his binoculars day and night to see what's going on and also keeps in touch with his friend Ronnie(played Aaron Yoo) who also comes over to his house. He also loves the look of his beautiful neighbour Ashley(played by Sarah Roemer) who he looks at a few times with his binoculars builds a love with her and she comes over to stay with him. He also starts getting suspicious about one of his neighbours Mr Turner(played by David Morse) who is a violent, malicious and manipulative killer and Ashley and Ronnie also also get suspicious of Mr Turners actions. Kales mum starts to get involved with Mr Turner which Kale doesn't approve and hates not knowing that Mr Turner is a killer. I have only seen Shia LaBeouf in the first three Transformers films but hadn't seen him in any other films but when I saw this film I was amazed and impressed. He really stood out in this film and his acting as an innocent, loving boy having suspicions about a malicious and manipulative killer as a neighbour was brilliant. The film was very tense, dramatic and scary and is an excellent film. This horror thriller had a combination of action, drama animosity, tension, rage, violence and light horror. Disturbia has some great things such as some excellent acting by Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, Carrie-Anne Moss, David Morse, Aaron Yoo, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Matt Craven and Viola Davis.",10,1,1,18 May 2020
Rocky IV," In between good and very good, but not very good or excellent and definitely not crap
","Rocky IV is an in between good and very good film with excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Paulie, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago and Brigitte Nielsen as Ludmilla. When the Russian Ivan Drago came to fight and Apollo Creed fought but Drago killed him in the ring, Rocky, his family and friends were saddened and also angry. So Rocky prepared to go to Russia to fight against the killer Ivan Drago. The film does have some great action and is a bit tense but it also is not tense enough and does lack things which Rocky III doesn't. Ivan Drago(played by Dolph Lundgren) was a powerful opponent and did also have some powerful punches but I didn't like him. The character Ivan Drago hardly spoke and just said only a few things, but his Russian supporters such as his wife Ludmilla(played by Brigitte Nielsen) were completely unnecessary and they shouldn't have put her in this film. The other Russian supporters were boasting and saying how great Ivan Drago was, that Drago was indestructible and showing their hatred towards the Americans. The character Ivan Drago was also a very powerful fighter but definitely not indestructible and not as Brutal as Clubber Lang(played by Mr. T) in Rocky III or ruthless as Tommy Gunn in Rocky V. There were some great fight scenes in the film and Ivan Drago fought well, but Clubber Lang in Rocky III was faster, his punches were fast, very powerful and very brutal and Tommy Gunns punches were also very powerful and brutal. The final fight was awesome and Rocky fought really well against Drago beating him and proving to the others including the Russians that the Russians are not the best and that Drago is not as good as he or they think he is.",7,0,0,1 September 2018
Face_Off," Tense awesome action and excellent acting by Travolta and Cage
","Face/Off is an absolutely brilliant thriller by director John Woo and which has excellent acting by John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. This film is an action packed film, full of hard, tense action and is a film which was very enjoyable to watch and is a film which I also loved watching. The acting by John Travolta as Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage as Castor Troy, Joan Allen as Eve Archer, Alessandro Nivola as Pollux Troy, Gina Gershon as Sasha Hassler and Dominique Swain as Jamie Archer was absolutely brilliant. I haven't seen many John Travolta films and only have 2 of his films on DVD, 1) Grease, 2) Face/Off, but besides Grease this film was awesome and Travoltas acting as Sean Archer was absolutely brilliant. Nicolas Cages acting as Castor Troy was also absolutely brilliant and I loved watching the controversy between Sean Archer and Castor Troy. Face/Off really had lots of great things about it and was a tense psychological thriller which involved Sean Archer having to go through facial surgery to become Castor Troy and for Castor Troy to become Sean Archer which caused confusion and tension amongst others including Sean Archers wife and daughter. The real Sean Archer who was Castor Troy was a more calmer man towards Eve and Jamie Archer, but the real Castor Troy was a more evil and too over the top man towards Eve and Jamie and had to be killed by the real Sean Archer. Face/Off is a thriller that I definitely recommend and it is a thriller that you're going to love if you haven't seen it.",10,2,3,22 September 2018
Ip Man," Awesome film with high powered martial arts fighting
","The films that Donnie Yen has done are excellent and he is an absolutely brillliant martial arts film actor who i really like. I have 8 of his films on DVD and his films are awesome and enjoyable to watch. The film Ip Man is about a fully accomplished master of Martial Arts who chooses to keep a low profile of his high powered strength in Martial Arts. The town sees and realises that Ip Mans Martial Arts strength and power is unstoppable. After the Japanese Invades, the town descends into pandemonium and struggles to survive. Ip Man rises up to challenge the evil General Miura and the Japanese forces who think that he and they the Japanese will destroy the Chinese but are wrong when they are up in a fierce and violent battle against the very powerful Ip Man. This film is an absolutely brilliant film with a brilliant story line, high powered martial arts fighting, tension and brilliant acting by Donnie Yen, Simon Yam, Lynn Xiong, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Ka Tung Lam, Siu Wong Fan and Xing Yu. The film was also dramatic which also made it a very good thing because the things that made it dramatic were done brilliantly. Donnie Yens acting and performance as Ip Man was absolutely amazing and brilliant. There were so many things that I loved about Donnie Yens acting as Ip Man in this film. His acting as a family member with a wife and son was also absolutely brilliant. I was stunned by his amazing performance as a family member and thought his performance was absolutely brilliant. The martial arts fighting done by the actors in this film was awesome to watch and see and the fight scenes which were also very tense with Donnie Yen in them were also absolutely amazing and brilliant. When watching Donnie Yen use his high powered martial arts skills when in fight scenes in the film Ip Man, I was fascinated and amazed at his speed, his strength and his skills in Martial Arts. When Ip Man fought against other very strong fighters besides the Japanese he really fought extremely well and the moves he used were absolutely awesome, high powered and brilliant. I loved the fight scene when Ip Man fought against General Miura and the film was also tense when the Japanese told Ip Man to teach them Wing Chun Kung Fu which he refused. I have Ip Man 2 and Ip Man 3 which i haven't seen yet but will watch soon and which i'm sure i will like and find maybe very good but won't be absolutely brilliant like this film. I absolutely loved watching the film and found it very enjoyable and entertaining to watch.",10,0,0,25 May 2019
Rocky III," Filled with awesome and powerful action
","Rocky III is an awesome film which has excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Paulie, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, Mr. T as Clubber lang and Hulk Hogan as Thunderlips. This film is much better than Rocky IV because it doesn't lack things which Rocky IV does. Rocky III is a very brutal film with awesome action. Rockys opponent the very brutal and ferocious Clubber Lang(played by Mr. T) has a lot of hate for Rocky and thinks too much of himself and thinks that he's the only champion boxer and that Rocky is a wimp. When asked by people who Interview Clubber Lang what's he going to do to Rocky, Clubber Lang says things such as ''Destroy him'', ''Kill Him'' and loads of other things showing his hate for Rocky. He also is a very loud, arrogant, aggressive and rude boxer and is very disrespectful when around other people threatening them and also telling them to ''Shut Up''. Clubber Langs fighting in this film is much more better than Ivan Dragos from Rocky IV. Clubber Langs punches are fast, brutal and very powerful and he is a killer in the ring when fighting. Also in this film Mr. T is awesome as Clubber Lang a great adversary for Rocky and the power and the physical and verbal anger and hatred his character displays in the ring towards Rocky is full of intensity and is just awesome. You didn't get this from Ivan Drago in Rocky IV and Clubber really knows how to express his thoughts, opinions and feelings towards Rocky excellently. Rocky III is a very intense film and that's what I absolutely love about this film compared to Rocky IV. Rocky IV is a bit intense but not as intense as Rocky III. The first Rocky film is the best but Rocky III is a film which beats a lot of the other Rocky films and is much more better than them. Films such as Rocky II, Rocky IV, Rocky V etc are no way as good or better than Rocky III. Rocky III is filled with awesome and powerful action and lots of more great things. When getting the correct training from Apollo Creed after getting knocked out by the dangerous Clubber Lang, Apollo wants Rocky to have the faith in himself as boxer and gives Rocky the proper training before Rocky goes in for a rematch against Clubber Lang. Again in the rematch you see Clubber Langs fast, brutal and very powerful punches which are awesome, but when Rocky tells Clubber to knock him out and blocks the punches that Rocky gets, the film gets even better and then Rocky starts doing some very powerful punches on Clubber Lang and eventually knocking out Clubber and winning the match. Rocky III is really a film that I think is absolutely awesome and I definitely will watch it again. This film is definitely what I would say as being the 2nd best Rocky film in the Rocky film series and deserves higher than 6.8/10. I give this film 9.7/10.",9,0,0,1 September 2018
Never Back Down," Just good, but not as good as Never Back Down 2
","This film is a good film with some great acting by Sean Faris, Amber Heard, Cam Gigandet, Evan Peters and Djimon Hounsou. Never Back Down is a film which does have some pretty good fighting, but the film is to over Glamorized. The film does have some great things about it such as Jake Tylers rebellious teen character, Max Coopermans friendly, confident, passionate and keen character, Baja Millers friendly, loving and caring character and Ryan McCarthys violent and malicious character. The acting by Sean Faris as Jake Tyler, Amber Heard as Baja Miller, Cam Gigandet as Ryan McCarthy, Evan Peters as Max Cooperman and Djimon Hounsou as Jean Roqua was very good. This film did lack things in quite a few ways though and one of the main things was that the violent and malicious martial arts champion Ryan McCarthy had a big ego and was a complete dickhead, thinking he's the most powerful person ever, but Jake Tyler proved him wrong and knocked the living daylights out of him. Compared to Never Back Down 2: The Beatdown, this film was no way as good as that film and Never Back Down 2 was a hell of a lot better than this film. Never Back Down 2 was a lot more tense than this film, the fighters were a lot better than these fighters and some of them were MMA Champions and the extremely powerful and absolutely brilliant martial arts film actor Michael Jai White was in the film not Djimon Hounsou and the fighting was a lot more tense, powerful and amazing compared to Never Back Down. None of the fighters in Never Back Down 2 had a big ego or were dickheads like Ryan McCarthy. Todd Duffee who acted as Tim Tim Newhouse is a MMA Champion in real life, is much more powerful than Cam Gigandet and would slaughter Ryan McCarthys arse to death. I'm not saying that this is a crap film, because it definitely isn't a crap film, it's just a good one and it has a few weak things to it that's all.",6,0,1,18 March 2018
Furious 7," Badly Ruined
","This film Fast and Furious 7 compared to the other Fast and furious films, the 1st Fast and Furious, 2Fast 2Furious, Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift, 4th Fast and Furious, Fast and Furious 5 and Fast and Furious 6 which were awesome and brilliant, is a film which really was badly ruined by a few things. They shouldn't have had a fight scene between Paul Walker and Tony Jaa. Tony Jaa is highly skilled in Muay Thai and other martial arts and is much more powerful than Paul Walker who is just a black belt in Brazilian Ju Jitsu, it just didn't work properly Tony Jaa was really powerfully attacking Paul Walker. They also shouldn't have put Jason Statham in this film as Deckard Shaw. Statham is far too overrated and they should have had someone else better than Statham such as Michael Jai White, Liam Neeson etc. These things really ruined the film.Rating 4.5 out of 10 (O.K)",Null,0,0,30 September 2017
