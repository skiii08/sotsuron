Scarface," Lame
","This movie sucked. O-kay, some parts were cool, but if you stop and realize what you've just watched for nearly 3 hours, it doesn't add up to much. There was that crappy 80's background music, every other word out of Tony's mouth was cock sucker or modder focker, and there were a lot of parts that could have been cut out to make it a shorter movie (like all the pointless dialogue at the swimming pool).I did like Al Pacino's over the top performance, because he was really convincing as a ravenous Cuban gangster, but all the over used cuss words, the unnecessary killing (yes, half the movies I like have graphic violence, but it's used in context, not just used), and painfully long dialogue make this a movie that is not worth watching. If you are a die hard Pacino or gangster movie fan, check this one out, but for every one else, skip it. 4/10",Null,0,0,14 August 2001
Ali," 'Float Like A Butterfly, Sting Like A Bee!'
","I don't understand why so many people didn't like this movie. I thought it was excellent. Will Smith did a great job at playing Muhammad Ali. He was very convincing, and he did a great job at Ali's flamboyant champion boxer personality, and his kinder, more devoted home life personality.
I really enjoy Michael Mann films ('Heat' and 'The Insider' are two of my favorite movies) and 'Ali' is no exception. It paints an accurate (from what I can remember) and honest portrayal of the life of Muhammad Ali. Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Ali, but after watching it, I liked him a lot more. I already respected his great boxing skills, but now I also respect his strong devotion to his family and his religion, and his passion for boxing.I think that this is the best boxing movie since 'Raging Bull', which is still the best, though. Will Smith is at his best in this movie, and I think he deserves an Oscar. I think that any one who likes boxing, or especially those who like Muhammad Ali to watch this. Sure, it's pretty long, but you should expect that when doing a movie about such a complex character as Ali. Enjoy! 9/10",Null,0,1,3 January 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'I'll Be Right Here'
","I've had this movie since I was about 9 or 10, and I had never watched it until last night. I really should have watched it when I was younger, but I can say that I really enjoyed it! It is the best family movie I have ever seen. E.T. is such a sweet character. This is my second favorite Steven Spielberg movie, the first being Jaws. This special effects are very good, even by now days standards. What I really liked about this movie is that E.T. is a character with complexities, rather than the usual alien who remains mysterious right up to when that hero or heroin blows him up.I also like the mix of comedy and drama. They were very well timed and paced. Besides E.T., I think my favorite character was Gertie. Drew Barrymore is adorable as the little sister. She has some very good one-liners, but she is also a believable character as well as a hysterical one. I think this was WAY better than 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. I really didn't like that movie. It was long and boring. This is obviously the better of the two alien films Spielberg did. This is my favorite family movie because it has more spirit and creativity than most others. I think that the only family movies that compare to E.T. are the new computer animated movies like 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek' (two more of my favorite family movies). Since I am probably the only person on Earth who hasn't seen E.T. before, I will skip my usual recommendations to certain groups because everyone has seen this movie, and it is for everyone except people who hate aliens. Enjoy! 10/10",Null,0,0,27 March 2002
Training Day," 'You Want to Go to Jail or You Want to Go Home?'
","Best movie I've seen all year. There were many great parts, but the gold goes to Denzel. I think this is his best movie, not his most challenging, but his best movie. It is great to see him as the bad guy for once.
Denzel Washington is a great actor, but he generally isn't in movies I like. But this was a nice change. I feel the same about Ethan Hawk, only instead of 'generally isn't in movies I like' it's 'never in movie I like', but I surely cannot say the same about Training Day. The two actors gave excellent performances, the subplots kept me interested, and the ending was great.
There is some pretty strong violence and a lot of profanity (yet it made Washington's character more believable as an inner city narcotics detective), but who ever can't handle the above should know better than going to a movie like this just by watching the previews, so enjoy! 10/10",Null,1,11,14 October 2001
Unbreakable," Shyamalan did it again!
","M. Night Shyamalan has made another great suspense thriller, and I think this one is just as good as the Sixth Sense. The surprise ending is just as good, and once again, like the Sixth Sense, if you watch it twice, the signs are all there.Samuel L. Jackson is one of my very favorite actors, as well as Bruce Willis, and the two are now a perfect on screen duo (Die Hard three stunk, and they never really met in Pulp Fiction). The story is very good, and the train station sequence is one of the most intense scenes I've ever seen! I loved this movie, and I encourage any one who like the Sixth Sense to check out this one, because they are not at all the same movie, but they are both spectacular! 10/10",Null,0,0,25 July 2001
Fight Club," I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge
","wow, this is really a defining movie. that's kind of a played out expression, something a self-important critic would say, but i think in this case it's true. i haven't read the book, but i can't imagine how insane that book is, and i'm sure it's great. this is possibly my favorite movie, and it's certainly the best movie i've seen (i think there's a difference between the two). it seems like everything in this movie just worked perfect, i can't think of any complaints.there are just so many strange things that make this movie great. i really liked the narrator's insight on what was going on. he sounds so emotionless and cold, i really think that added a great atmosphere to this movie. the director is really gifted in order to make a movie with such a difficult premise so good. the fight scenes were so real, it was really disturbing, especially when edward norton went nuts on that pretty blonde kid and f***ed up his face. i also really enjoyed some of the lines in this movie, most of the lines actually.and than there's the ending. the greatest ending ever. i won't spill it, as the ending was ruined for me right before i saw it (i was p***ed but in the end it took nothing away from the movie), but it is just incredible. i can't say enough good about this movie, it's the perfect definition for a great movie (another brainless critic saying, but it's true). 10/10",Null,0,1,28 November 2003
As Good as It Gets," Maybe the Best Comedy Ever Made
","This was a great film. The combination of comedy and drama was very enjoyable. I think that this is my 3rd favorite Jack Nicholson movie, the first two being .....Cuckoo's Nest and The Shining. Helen Hunt always plays a good part but she was outstanding in 'As Good As It Gets', this is my favorite movie of hers. Also, Greg Kinnear is very strong support to Nicholson and Hunt, this is most certainly Kinnear's best movie.
This is probably the best comedy/drama ever made, right alongside The Sting. The comedy is very funny, yet the drama stays strong also, most comedy/dramas either not enough comedy or not enough drama. James L. Brooks did a great job in his direction (a big step from The Critic).Cuba Gooding Jr. is also another reason to watch this movie. He is very convincing as Kinnear's good friend. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for their performances, which were well deserved. Jack Nicholson also proves that he is still as good an actor now as he was 30 years ago. 10/10",Null,0,0,3 November 2001
The Fan," 'A Simple Thank You Would Have Been Nice'
","This movie wasn't as bad as everyone says. I think it's safe to say that I am a fan of Robert De Niro, and that will certainly help if you like Robert De Niro to enjoy this movie. But I didn't enjoy this movie solely on the fact that I like De Niro, I thought Snipes gave an equally choice performance. The thrills in this movie were small, but they were satisfying. The ending is, without a doubt, the best part. There were other good thrills though, like the freezer scene. I must say that I liked this movie a good deal. Its is not without its flaws, but in order to enjoy this movie, and a lot of other movies for that matter, you must look past the flaws, and just take it for what it is. Enjoy this movie for its handful of thrills, decent acting, and great music (I am a big fan of the Rolling Stones also). This is a good no-brainer with a creepy overtone, so just watch it for its pros, not its cons. 8/10",Null,36,49,26 September 2001
Mississippi Burning," The most horrifying part is that this actually happened
","After watching 'Mississippi Burning', I was disgusted with the South. Sure, not all southern people are racist b***ards, but it does have its share. When I found out that this was a true story, I was sickened, but overall, not surprised. It is clear that the South doesn't have a very good record, but the fact is, this crap still happens, although not as much.This was a great movie. I thought Gene Hackman did a terrific job, and so did Willem Defoe. This was a very compelling story,and not a very easy one to watch. There were certain parts where I wanted to yell 'Stop! What is the matter with you!' Human nature can be a sickening thing, and this movie did a great job of showing this.The KKK basically ran that town, and Mississippi, and a good deal of the south in the 20's through the 60's, and showing this very clearly made this movie very haunting. The way that town treated their black community is horrific. This is an outstanding film, and should be watched. I think that if you enjoy realistic movies, and can stomach some very disturbing parts, than watch this, because this is the best movie of its kind I have ever seen. Gene Hackman summed up Mississippi in the 60's very well when he said 'Mississippi has four i's but cannot see'. 10/10",Null,2,4,9 February 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Holy F****** S***, that's a lot of F****** profanity!
","I cracked up when I first saw this. It's hysterical. That is, if you don't mind vulgar, profuse, offensive, and outrageously funny swearing. This movie is most certainly not for everyone. I liked it because, well, it was funny as hell!Sure, so the word f*** is used over 300 times, and there are a lot of vile and offensive remarks, but it's all in how you look at it. Now I was a little surprised at all the cussing, but I wasn't offended, because it wasn't directed at me, so it didn't bother me. There were no personal jokes directed at the audience, so it didn't bother me. I guess I'm not easily offended, or I'm completely desensitized (yeah, that's probably it), so I enjoyed this movie, and believe it or not, there was some subtlety to the humor, so watch it if you don't mind cussing!  8/10",Null,0,0,30 July 2001
The Hustler," A Good Movie
","This was a pretty good film. I liked 'The Color of Money' a lot better but this was still a good movie, although the two can hardly be compared, because 'The Color of Money' and 'The Hustler' are in no way the same.This was a much heavier, darker movie than 'The Color of Money'. Had Paul Newman not been in this movie it would not be as good, because Paul Newman was made to play Fast Eddie. Jackie Gleason does a good job as the pool hall big-shot Minnesota Fats, and Piper Laurie does a *GREAT* job as Eddies alcoholic girlfriend Sarah.This was an early film for Newman and he isn't the same Eddie in 'The Hustler' as the much older, wiser Eddie in 'The Color of Money'. Both films are very good, but I think I liked 'The Color of Money' better because I saw it first, and since 'The Color of Money' is much tamer than 'The Hustler', I wasn't expecting such a tragic and dark movie, but it is still an excellent movie. Check it out, but be sure to see the 'The Color of Money' with it. 9/10",Null,2,4,14 August 2001
Insomnia," Al Pacino's Best Performance since 'Scent of a Woman'
","This is in Al Pacino's top 4 performances. It is either this or 'Scent of a Woman' (the other two being 'The Godfather' or 'Scarface'). Personally, I liked this one, simply because I like 'Insomnia' more than I liked 'Scent of a Woman', which is also an excellent film. Infact, you might even say this is my favorite Al Pacino movie, but 'The Godfather' is a hard one to top.This movie has everything a crime drama should have, great acting, great script, great plot, great cinematography (this was an absolutely stunning backdrop), and a lot of suspense. Hilary Swank does a great job as Pacino's protege, who has studied all his cases and is thrilled to have him there, despite the fact that a young girl has been beaten to death. Robin Williams gave the best performance I have ever seen him give. He is such a convincing psychopath. I think he should get an Oscar, along with Pacino and Swank.As far as Oscar's go, I think this film deserves all the major categories. In my opinion, the only other film this year that I think could rival this movie is 'We Were Soldiers', but I doubt that will even get a nomination. Pacino just deserves this one. He deserves it. But I think that as of right now, this one's in the bag for Robin Williams. This movie is for people who love great drama's, or Al Pacino (drama is really all that Al does anyway). Go see this, because when I went to see this, only two other people were in the movie theatre, and I'm worried that 'Insomnia' won't find an audience because everyone is all going to Episode 2 (I briefly considered seeing it, but then decided I wouldn't want to waste the money). Enjoy! 10/10",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Awesome!
","This movie was very cool! Johnny Depp is very funny, as well as convincing, Christina Ricci is stunning, and played her part very well, and Christopher Walken was creepy, but in a sense funny, because all he said was 'HAH!' The town was very bleak and dark, and the beheadings were done just tasteful enough to where you got a peak but not a long stare, unlike many driller-killer movies. The special effects were nothing short of magnificent, and the web of lies, deceit, and murder make the film all the more better. 10/10",Null,0,1,6 June 2001
We Were Soldiers," The best movie I've seen in years!
","This was an outstanding film. I couldn't have been more pleased while leaving the movie theatre. What I think makes this movie so great is that it focuses on the soldiers themselves, rather than what they are doing there, or why. I honestly think this is the best character development in a war movie ever (I would say the Deer Hunter, but that isn't really a war movie). Mel Gibson hasn't given a stronger or better performance since 'Braveheart'. i think he deserves a best actor Oscar.Many of the reviews I have read have called Mel's performance as Hal Moore a cliche. That isn't true though, because that is the way Hal Moore really was then, and is now. That is what most people don't realize. Even if Hal Moore is a cliche himself, I don't care, because he is an interesting character, and Mel did a damn fine job at portraying him. This, along with 'Platoon' and 'Braveheart', is my favorite war movie, and one of my favorite films. This movie captures (or so I'm told) the horror and tragedy that goes on on the battlefield of Vietnam, or most any war, as best it can, because it would be impossible to capture the 'real' terror in a movie, because the real terror happens within each individual soldier, and that is probably scarier than anything else on earth. What I really liked about this movie, and what makes it so unique, is that it shows the Vietnamese soldiers as young, frightened men who are just as scared as the American troops. I also liked how the Vietnamese commander was also worried about his men and morned their death, when most war movie show the enemy as soleless monsters who are out to get America (i know people know that is not how they really are, or at least I hope I do). So watch this film for it great performances, Sam Elliot gave outstanding support which is worthy of an Oscar too, it's incredible realism (which is almost too hard to watch at parts), and it's powerful scenes of men fighting and being killed for each other. 10/10",Null,1,2,12 March 2002
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'For a Moment There I Thought We Were In Trouble'
","This is a great movie all around. It's a great Western, it's a great comedy, it's a great action, and it's a great drama. George Roy Hill did an excellent job with this movie. Paul Newman is one of my favorite actors, and who doesn't like Robert Redford? I just recently saw this movie and I was very pleased when it was over. They also managed to make this an accurate depiction, because, like the tagline states, for the most part, it's true.
Paul Newman and Robert Redford do outstanding jobs as Butch and Sundance. They have make a great team, and it's fun to watch them rob trains and banks, and narrowly escape from the Pinkerton Posse. This movie also has great performances. The two actors make you like Butch and Sundance, and you want them to escape.I also thought it was interesting when I learned that the real Hole In The Wall Gang (besides Butch and Sundance)would soon become the Wild Bunch, or so I'm told. I find this movie a total enjoyment and can be enjoyed by anyone. I think that even the most shrill person can find things they like about this movie, so check it out, because it is and always will be a classic! 10/10",Null,48,63,23 December 2001
Alien," If any movie should be represented as a Sci-Fi Classic, this should be it!
","This is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. It's so original. The Alien itself is the best special effects monster ever (don't shove that Predator crap in my face either, it was good, but this blew it right off the map), and the huge mining ship was very gloomy, but the most impressive piece of scenery was the alien's home planet.Ridley Scott has directed the best Sci-Fi film ever! The whole movie is very suspenseful, and the scene where the creature breaks its way through the guys chest is one of the goriest, yet most memorable scenes in movie history.Tom Skerritt and Sigourney Weaver made an excellent team trying to fight off the 8 foot killing machine. The Suspense is gripping, the violence is subtle, but not too subtle, the Alien is frightening, and the surrounding of the distant future is bleak and almost gothic. All you Sci-Fi fans out there who haven't seen this, what are you waiting for, go rent it and you won't be disappointed! 9/10",Null,1,3,13 August 2001
Taxi Driver," In my top 5 movies!
","When I first saw this I was blown away. This has got to be one of the greatest films ever made. Set in New York City, taxi driver Travis Bickle is obsessed with cleaning the streets of urban scum. At first he has no specific plan, until he meets a young prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster), and her trashy pimp (Harvey Keitel). At that point he gets completely organized and sets out to save this young girl. Some of the best acting I've ever seen. My favorite de niro movie, other favorites are Raging Bull and GoodFellas. A must see. 10/10.",10,1,1,18 March 2001
Full Metal Jacket," One of the best movies ever, until the second half
","This was one of the best movies I've ever seen about the war, except the war parts. The first half was brutal, powerful, sometimes painful to watch (like the blanket party scene), and actually pretty funny at times (the stuff that the drill sergeant say is hard not to laugh at); but as the fresh Marines are sent off to Hell, the movie seems to go with it.
When I first saw my thoughts were 'if the first half was that good, than the second will be unbelievable', but it lost its edge and its intensity. The sniper scene was the best part of the second half, but still falls short.
Now that I look back, though, it would be pretty damn hard to top the boot camp parts, i mean, those scenes were insane in the best way. Vincent D'Onfrio made the whole movie. He was completely believable with his decent into madness, much like Bobby D in 'Taxi Driver'. The drill sergeant also made this movie, because he was very funny, but at the same time horrifying.
Normally when the second half of a movie fails, i don't like it, because that is more significant that the first part, but in this case, i am willing to give it a good rating, just because the scenes with D'Onofrio were so incredible. This is a very gritty, disturbing, and great movie, like all of Kubrick's films, so be advised for profuse (but at time comical) swearing and bloody, gooey and sometimes exploding violence. Not great, but still very good. I also think that 'Paint it Black' was a great way to stop this movie, because it didn't end, it just stopped (which was one of the things I DID like about the end). 8/10",Null,0,1,1 November 2002
Glory," One of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen
","I have a lot of favorite movies, and this one ranks pretty high with them. I couldn't believe how realistic and powerful this movie was! This movie seemed very accurate. The acting was outstanding, Matthew Broderick plays the lead Colonel Robert Shaw, an unforgettable roll that he played superbly, which is his best roll to date, Denzel Washington steels the show as Private Trip, a white hating former slave who isn't fighting for The Union or anyone else but his own frustration and anger at the life he had to and has to live, and then there's  Morgan Freeman, who can turn a bad movie good anyway, but in a good movie he creates this certain atmosphere where it is believable and realistic, yet still very entertaining.Cary Elwis was also incredible as Major Forbes. This movie very accurately portrays the first all black regiment ever, the 54th. The drama is powerful and stays strong through out the film. The many battles the men fight are horrific, like wars and battles should be shown on film (unlike that action turkey about Vietnam, MIA, where the whole movie is a big stupid action, now I like many action films, but a war film should not be an action).
Any person who likes realistic war films, excellent character development stories, Matthew Broderick or Denzel Washington will definitely enjoy Glory. This is my 3rd favorite war film (#2 is The Deer Hunter-#1 is Platoon)and one of my all time favorite movies. It should have won more Oscars. I encourage you to go rent this because you will not be disappointed! 10/10",Null,0,0,6 November 2001
Forrest Gump," 'Bye Bye Jenny. They sendin' me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country.'
","I loved this movie. I don't care what people say. either you loved this movie or hated it. I loved it. I thought it was the second best film of 1994, and in the top ten best films of the 90's. It's one of my favorite movies. Tom Hanks gave a great, if not his best performance in Forrest Gump (it's either this, 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Big'). Robin Wright and Sally Field gave outstanding to Tam Hanks, but I thought that the performance to match with Tom Hanks' was Gary Sinise. This is his best performance (next to 'Of Mice and Men'). His character, Lieutenant Dan, is the most tragic as he goes from being a proud platoon leader in Vietnam to a faithless, surly man who is confined to a wheelchair, who blames Forrest for his legs. One of the most moving scenes is when he is on the shrimp boat with Forrest, thanks him for saving his life, and swims into the sunlight, where he makes his peace with God.Many people didn't like this movie because of the hype, or the lewdness (I've heard people complain of it before), or the story itself, but on any account, I loved this movie. It is very sad, funny, exciting, and heart warming. Robert Zemeckis did a great job with the direction. I think my favorite part was either the running scenes or the shrimp boat scenes. I think that any one could enjoy this movie, keeping in mind you know what your about to watch. 10/10",Null,5,8,6 February 2002

","This if the greatest movie I've seen in years. It was an outstanding piece of American Cinema. This movie had it all; romance, action, drama, comedy, suspense, it's got everything. The special effects were mesmerizing, the acting was very convincing, and the story itself is probably the best story ever told.At first I was sceptical, simply because it said Elijah Wood in the credits, but I was surprised to see that he did a great job. The characters in the movie go through so many adventures and hard ships that you are not board for one second the entire movie. The power of the Ring over everyone who comes across it makes you wonder who will be the next to fall under the Ring's seductive curse. I can't see how anyone could go to this movie and utterly enjoy it! This movie will inspire many to read the book, and from what I understand, the movie followed the book as closely as possible. I think this movie should win some Oscar's, because it is the best film in recent years, and it has become a favorite of mine.

This was also Tom Cruise's best movie. one of the great things about this movie is this time around Fast Eddie is a little more mature and wiser. I don't really think of this as a sequel, because it wasn't really. The only thing that connects the two is Fast Eddie, other than that their totally different. Scorsese did an outstanding job in directing this movie, and the musical score is very good.Scorsese is a great director because he can do so many different styles of direction.

The Thing," 'Why Don't We Just Wait Here a While; See What Happens'
","This Is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen! It's got everything a sci-fi movie should have. This was so underrated because of that little 'peaceful' alien E.T. came out at about the same time, and most people saw E.T. first and were than disgusted by 'The Thing' (No complaints about E.T. though, who doesn't like him?). There are some really neat monster effects in this movie, most of them rather bizarre, but if you have seen John Carpenter movies before than you know what kind of bizarre to expect.Kurt Russell is very cool in this movie as he and the other men at the Antarctic facility try and fight off this nearly invincible foe. The monster and Kurt Russell are the whole reason to watch this movie, so if you plan on watching a conspiracy sci-fi movies, don't bother with The Thing, because this is just monsters, flame throwers, and snow, very simple stuff.This is probably my favorite sci-fi movie next to Alien and Aliens, and I think any fan of Kurt Russell, John Carpenter, or big, slimy, human killing, body transforming, mutant space creatures will love this movie. To me, Escape From New York and The Thing are John Carpenter's two best movies, so check out one or the other if your a fan of cult sci-fi classics. 9/10",Null,0,1,27 October 2001

And certainly not Stephen Webber.Stanley Kubrick has made a movie that has not lost it's edge, and is still scaring the crap out of it's viewers! Some say the axe in the door scene was the scariest, but I think it was the twins in the hallway, you know which scene it was.The blood in the elevator was very cool, and the score definitely made the movie scarier, and the hotel is so large that you never really know where Jack might be (the actual hotel is only 20 miles away from where I live).

American Beauty," 'My name is Lester Burnham. In less than one year, I will be dead.'
","This is one of my favorite movies. It was spectacular! I couldn't believe how well every thing tied together. This movie is great on many levels, be it the incredible acting, or the fantasy (not fairies and dragons, of course) that has become one ordinary man's life. I think what I liked best, though (besides the best lead acting job I've seen since Robert De Niro in 'Raging Bull'), was how two separate and already incredible stories enter-twine into a spectacular ending, that leaves you feeling better and with what seems like a new way of looking at life. This is just me, though; because many people hated it (I just don't think they fully understood, but maybe I'm wrong).Now some of you out there might be enraged that I put that quote up there, thinking that I ruined the film, but I actually didn't. It's the first line in the movie! That is one of the reason why this is such a great movie, though. It told you he would be dead by the closing of the film, so that made me think that this would be great, because it doesn't depend on a sad ending to make it a good movie. The ending wasn't really sad, but more enlightening. It wasn't an ending for Lester, it was a beginning. Lester's story is about him becoming a man that he likes to be. He goes from a repressed, prideless loser, to a happy, healthy (both physically and mentally), care free man. He starts doing what he likes and getting what he wants (which leads in to my favorite line in the movie, where he goes and arbitrarily buys a beautiful Camaro). Meanwhile, there is the Burnham's new next door neighbor Ricky Fitts, who is overwhelmed by all the beauty (most of which people would describe as awful), and tries to show other people (mostly Lester and his daughter Jane, who Ricky is in love with) how beautiful life is. Ricky really changes the Burnham's lives. He shows Lester how to live (with a little help from pot), and shows Jane how to love. While this is all happening, Annette Bening's character is being alienated by her family, bu it is really her own fault. Rickies dad is a very interesting character. He tries to hide his emotions with a shield of callousness and hatred for everything he doesn't understand, but throughout his appearances, you can tell the shield is getting smaller, and it eventually isn't there any more (he is a major part in the end).Beside Ricky, Lester also undergoes a life style change in order to get Jane's friend, Angela (who is played greatly by Mena Suvari), to notice him. He is infatuated with her, and he is willing to do anything to get her. She is a very good character. What I realized about this movie the second time I saw it was that every character in this movie is repressing there true selves in some way, trying to be very convincing about what they want every one else to see, but they are all miserable, and want to reveal themselves. This is the movies mantle, but I think the core of this movie is that life has to much beauty and happiness to waste being miserable and trapped by there own doubts and insecurities. This movie is not for every one, because it is pretty harsh at parts, but it has such a meaningful point that the harsh parts are able to be excepted (I didn't think it was harsh, but I know people who did). I recommend this to any one who enjoys beautiful films, because I think this is the best movie in 10 years. Enjoy! 10/10",Null,0,0,10 April 2002
Edward Scissorhands," This Movie is Magnificent!!!!!
","Comedy, Drama, and yes, a pinch of action. This is what you would find in one of 1990's best films.....Edward Scissorhands. While the plot is great, and the little extra details make this movie all the more wonderful. Edward is a misunderstood young man with scissors for hands (my guess is, you figured that out from the TITLE), and was created (no, he's not a robot) by an inventor in a 'spooky' house on the top of a hill. One day, a cosmetics sales woman goes into the house, finds Edward, and brings him to the neighborhood in hopes of a newer, better life. But All this falls apart when he gets exploited by the media,  feared and hated by the public, and becomes an outcast from a string of events that weren't his fault. While it is a fulfilling comedy, it is an even better drama. When all of his new found joy is eliminated, and becomes hated by most all (I say MOST all), you tend to share his pain.  So in conclusion, Tim Burton is a great director, as he has proved in Edward Scissorhands! 10/10",Null,0,0,26 April 2001
Face_Off," 'Oh well. Plan B; let's just kill each other!'
","This is a cool movie. Cage and Travolta make a surprisingly good team. Nicolas Cage wasn't the best villain, but John Travolta is one of the greatest villains I have ever seen! He is evil. Pure evil. Nicolas Cage makes a much better hero.The idea for Face/Off is very original, and this is one of those movies that you should just leave it up to the imagination, because if you let facts get in the way, then the movie won't be any fun.John Woo is the master at making an intense shoot-out, they were some of the best gun-fights I've ever seen. Joan Allen did a great job as Eve, because she wasn't the typical superwife that you see in most action movies, she was realistic.This is one of the very best action movies ever made, and I'd compare this to other great action movies as Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and The Rock. 9/10",Null,0,0,25 July 2001
Aliens," 'Get Away From Her You BITCH!'
","Wow, this was an awesome sequel! It's the Third best sequel ever made (the other two being the godfather 2 and the color of money). The special effects have out-done themselves in this movie (there are  different types of aliens in this one).I don't think that the the two sequels can be compared, because they are totally different. This one offered loads of action, while 'Alien' gave us loads of suspense. There are more interesting weapons and gadgets, but I kind of wish the alien drones were a little tougher, like in the first one.Ah yes, and lets not forget Sigourney Weaver, the *BEST* female action star ever. She puts a whole meaning to the word 'action star'. The best and most thrilling scene in this movie, or for that matter, in all Sci-Fi movies, was the show down between the Queen Alien and Ripley in the fork lift (which has been futilely imitated many times). This was the best fight in Sci-Fi movies ever. This fight also spawned a very memorable catch phrase, seen above
So in closing, this is not really a sequel to 'Alien' because the two movies are nothing alike, they both have great qualities, but in incomparable ways. Watch it Sci-Fi fans, ya won't be disappointed! 9/10",Null,0,0,13 August 2001
American History X," The Saddest Part Is The Reality of It All
","This was the best movie I've seen in years. It is certainly the best movie of 1998, and in the top 3 of the 90s. I first watched this on USA, and was unimpressed with the poor dubbing (I don't know anyone who says shut the freak up on purpose) and the removal of important scenes, so I changed it after an hour, though what I saw intrigued me, so I rented it. I was shocked at the end. This movie was more than excellent, it was one of the greatest movies of all. I couldn't believe my eyes. I find that some controversial movies are only controversial because they add in different colors and tilt the camera while showing graphic violence in slow motion. This is all fine and well when the movie is good and trying to make a point, which most don't, but this one did. The cinematography added to the already powerful setting.Many found this movie to hard to watch, and some were disgusted by it. I don't easily offend, so I'll watch about anything, but this movie's  brutal violence and rape scenes where so hard to watch, because of the realism involved. Events like this happen everywhere, and the horrific things one will do to another are terrifying, and this is what this movie was saying. People who hate one another for race or religion don't accomplish anything, and I think this movie stated that very well.This is now one of my favorite movies, and I will remember it. This movie leaves disturbing and tragic images. The acting is excellent (Norton should have won Best Actor, how well), and the plot was all too real. I recommend this movie to anyone who handles strong violence, neo nazi's, rape, and death. If you do watch this,you may be disturbed, but you won't be let down. 10/10",Null,0,0,28 September 2001
The Usual Suspects," 'the greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was convincing the world he didn't exist'
","This was an excellent movie. It's in my top ten films. When I first turned it on I figured it would be a run of the mill thriller, with no thrills. But when I turned off the vcr, I realized I had just seen the best thriller ever made, and it is my favorite thriller.The whole cast did a great job, but the applause goes to Kevin Spacey. He was phenomenal! He was a simple character, but he was full of surprises, lots of them. There were several memorable scenes, like the line-up scene, that will become classics. I really enjoyed this film, but it's not for all. There is a lot of violence and profanity, but that doesn't bother me.

28 Days Later...," The End is Extremely F**king Nigh
","wow, this movie was awesome! by far my favorite horror movie. it starts off very good. this is like the first zombie movie i've seen where there is actually a reasonable explanation for why a virus was spread (as far as reason and zombies are concerned). it was pretty intelligent. but what instantly drew me in was when our hero Jim wakes up in a hospital, completely deserted (aside from a full frontal shot which i could have done without). he gets out of the hospital and looks at the city, also completely deserted, except there are dead bodies everywhere. Jim walks around for about five minutes looking for anyone while a creepy piano jingle is played.but it keeps getting better from there. this movie has a thousand thrills, not really scary, but very suspenseful. one of the best things about this movie is the beautiful landscape. that's what i loved was the shots when there would be momentary peace, and our heroes would stop and look at the scenery and just enjoy the last few nice things on earth for a moment (probably the two best of these was the family of uninfected horses roaming a field, and the city of Cambridge burning, because there were no fire squads to put it out). Jim is a very likable character, as well as Selena, his beautiful survival partner, and Hannah, the young teen who's father was killed.this is by far my favorite horror movie. the guy's who wrote and directed are VERY talented and could easily do more serious movies, but i'm glad they did an excellent horror film. one of my favorite parts was when one of the guards says 'f*ckies!'. i love that word (this movie takes place in england, so i figure it's an english word). well, this movie is really gory, but if you do not like blood than it is ok, because the movie is good enough to where even the gore can be overlooked (i enjoyed the gore actually, it wasn't over done, it was just right). 10/10",Null,0,0,30 July 2003

","this was a cool movie. lot's of action, and we got introduced to some new and cool characters, namely Golum, the weird newt frog man, i suppose that's what you'd call him. Golum was my favorite character in this move. it's a good thing they did all of these movies at once, or else the hype might have over shadowed the quality of the movie, but they did this a good as it could get. i also thought the tree people were really cool. they were sort of comical, but when it came time to take them seriously, surprisingly enough, you actually could take these trees seriously. it was good to see gandalf return as well. i didn't know he would cause i haven't read the book. the action scene at the end was cool, but i actually liked the parts where Golum was leading Sam and Froto though the land better, just because it showed who Golum used to be, and still partially is. The battle was pretty awesome, though.all in all i'd say this is a satisfactory follow up. i liked it just as much as the original. it's fun for kiddies and grown ups alike. this one isn't nearly as violent as everyone was making it out to be, but it's still pretty gory at parts. can't wait for return of the king to come out! 10/10",Null,0,0,18 March 2003
Dog Day Afternoon," 2nd best film of 1975!
","I say it is the 2nd best because I think One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best, I mean, you can't beat Jack when he gives it all he's got, but this came in a close second.   First off, I usually like any Al Pacino movie, but this one is particularly good. He plays his character like he is Sonny Wortzick! John Cazale gave an absolute knockout performance as the paranoid, nervous, and unsafe behind a large machine gun character of Sal. He truly made me wonder how stable he could be under that much pressure. The movies intensity can only be measured in the amount of sweat on the arm of you chair. O-kay, so I'm being a little overly dramatic about this movie, but it is extremely intense. Although the whole thing is good, what makes it so extraordinary is the last two or three minutes when you see weather they make it..... or don't! What made the film all the more better was the fact that no background music was in this (which gave it a creepy extra touch); but most of all, the whole story is TRUE!!!!!! I will not give away the end because I'm just not about that, but trust me, you will be surprised! 9/10",Null,1,2,14 July 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," psychos do not explode when sunlight hits them, I don't give a f*** how crazy they are!
","Cool! Bad Ass! Awesome! I use these words to describe FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. This movie was cool, bad ass, and awesome. I thought it was a good change in pace for vampire movies, and action movies in general. I think only a few directors can make an action movie work while being confined in some what small surroundings, and they are Robert Rodriguiz, Quinten Tarantino, and John Carpenter.There were great actors in this, including George Clooney (he was a bad ass in this, and most of his movies in general), Harvey Keitel (who is also a bad ass, but in this he's more of the bad ass farther type), and the always bad ass Juilette Lewis (need I say more). I certainly cannot recommend this to every one. But for those who don't mind strippers dancing one minute and decimating a guy's face and throat the next, a lot of profanity, crude weapons (including a jack-hammer with a stake on the end), bikers, bat/vampires, and bad asses with guns, than this could be your cup of tea. 8/10",Null,5,7,24 August 2001
A Clockwork Orange," This Movie Defines 'Classic'
","I have never seen a movie like this. It was totally original,  violent (even to now days standards), disturbing, and magnificent. Malcolm McDowell makes a once in a career performance as Alex. I watched this for the first time about 6 years ago, and I figured I was going to see somewhat of a crappy movie, because most of the time, I don't agree with the hype.When the movie rolled its credits, I didn't know what to think. I had never seen a movie like this. This movie is 100% original. The acting is great, the story is great, and the psychological and physical pain that Alex both dishes out as well takes it in is almost too hard to watch.I don't recommend that you gather your kids to watch this, but this should be a movie for any one who thinks they have a strong stomach. Many people will be disgusted with this movies strong violence, but it is a classic, and it is one of the best movies I've ever seen!

Reservoir Dogs," What a pleasant change in pace!
","This was a life saver! Between the late 70's and early 90's, all the action/crime films were pretty much the same (it was always either Clint Eastwood or Steven Segal, what a dark time for movies), until Quinten Tarantino came along with Reservoir Dogs, after that crime thrillers were saved! Finally, a good crime movie that is about the characters, not the fire power. The movie is complex in a simple way, and outstanding dialogue! What I also found amazing was this was an excellent film, yet there were no women! Before I saw this, if you would have told me a movie could be great without women, I would disagree! But this shouldn't fall into the wrong hands, because only the master director (my favorite next to Scorsese), Quinten Tarantino could pull it off.This was a great caper with excellent acting, excellent premise, EXCELLENT dialogue, and an excellent, unexpected ending. The characters were very good, and aside from Keitel, Steve Buscemi was my favorite character as Mr. Pink, the hot headed, paranoid thief who just wants to take the diamonds and run. Check it out if you don't mind vulgar language, torture, blood, shootings, and or paranoia, check it out, you won't be disappointed! 10/10",Null,1,3,15 August 2001
Pulp Fiction," it's the dialogue
","Now Quinten Tarantino is my 2nd favorite director (first being Martin Scorsese), and I think what makes his movies so great is the dialogue. Throughout the whole movie superb dialogue takes place just before, or right after a turning point in the movie. Now I'm not saying it would have been bad if the dialogue wasn't there, it still would have been a good movie, but the conversations about things that are totally trivial make this an excellent flick! Not for the faint of heart, but for anyone else, because this is one of the great films in American cinema! 10/10",Null,0,0,8 April 2001
The Untouchables," Pretty Good, If You Don't Watch It For Historical Accuracy!***SPOILER***
","O kay, this was a good action flick, probably De Palma's best (unlike the drudgery of Scarface), but if your in it to learn about the real Untouchables and there hunt for Al Capone, watch the History Channel, because this is not what actually happened. For one thing, none of the Untouchables were killed by Capone or his gang, nor did they see any action, with the exception of busting open crates of Hooch.What I find most laughably inaccurate is when Eliot Ness throws Frank Nitti off the court house roof. Truth be told, after Capone was sent on his little vacation to prison, Frank Nitti took over Capone's Empire (though I don't think he did anything to make headlines). Now remember, I said it is still a good action movie.I though De Niro was awesome Al Capone. He kept a cool head around the press, but when it came down to business, he was stone cold. I always like De Niro's roles, and this one is no exception. He was fun to watch. I loved that scene in the beginning when the barber cuts him shaving (while the cameras are on him), and everyone is in shock waiting to see what he does, and the barber looks as though he's about to have a heart attack, and he just cleans it off and says 'don't worry about it'.Kevin Costner is a top notch actor, one of the best, and he really showed it in this. From watching people talk about him on t.v. and reading articles about the real Eliot Ness, it sounds like Kevin Costner really nailed it down. Sean Connery, in his Oscar winning role, is the hardened Irish beat cop turned Untouchable for his knowledge of the street and his tough as nails way to deal with crooks. I think he was my favorite character, and Sean Connery did a great job as Jim Malone.All in all, this was fun to watch for it's great action sequences ( the best was the train station gun fight), it's great acting, and the authentic 1930's Chicago background (which is my favorite city). Watch it for the above, but don't expect a history lesson, because that would leave you falsely informed. 8/10",Null,1,2,14 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Too Much and Not Enough
","this was really disapointing. to say the least. this movie tried to succeed the first by throwing plot twists and new characters and confusing surprises at it's viewers. it tried to be all trippy with the 'mind blowing' camera angles and special effects, but these were no different from the first movies, yet it worked better in the first one because it was also accompanied with plot and the characters even seemed more interesting in the first movie. i guess i'm being a little harsh in this movie, because i would be extrordinarily hard to beat the original Matrix. but i just fell short. they tried to keep the movie alive by creating new plot ever half an hour, but it could have been a lot better if it would have just stayed on one plot, because that is one of the things that made the first so much better. the characters also seemed a little dead in this one. they aren't as interesting. this movie did have some pretty cool action scenes, though. the parts on the freeway kicked ass. but there needs to be a successful plot to go with good action sequences. i'm just hoping that Revolutions the will properly pick the movie back up in a good conclusion. i am looking forward to Revolutions, though. 7/10",Null,0,0,10 June 2003
Die Hard," 'Now I have a machine gun. Ho Ho Ho'

An original plot, and this movie introduced Bruce Willis to almost a decade of blockbuster action movies, including three Die Hards, but none compared to the original (much like the Lethal Weapon series).The explosions, machine guns, and hand guns go on for a good solid two hours, and it was a well spent ride, because there was also a good story. The hero isn't a big huge, emotionless army guy who lives to blow s*** up, he has a wife and kids, and would very much like to spend Christmas with them.The dad from Family Matters is in this as a comedic side-kick type person, and Alan Rickman is a the evil Hans Gruber, which he does a very good job at.

The house on the hill was hauntingly eerie, because you never knew what could be inside. This is the best horror movie to date, and it will probably never be beaten. Alfred Hitchcock is the best horror/suspense director ever, and one of the best directors ever. If you haven't seen it, watch it! There's no real violence, at least not graphic violence (which is another high point, this  film can still be incredibly convincing without resorting to unnecessary close-ups).

Jaws," 'You're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat'
","This was an awesome movie. After all this time has past it is still the best of its kind. I always thought that the black, emotionless eyes on the shark were its scariest features, aside from its huge jaws. This is my favorite Steven Spielberg movie. I liked the way that Steven Spielberg only showed the shark actually eating a person, and it was the most bloody and horrific scene in the whole movie. Spielberg's directing tactics really show in this movie, like the way you could see through the shark's point of view.I liked pretty much all of the characters in this movie, but most of all, I liked Robert Shaw as Quint. He was the best character, partly because he was so insane. He is like Captain Ahab, and Jaws is like Moby Dick. I also liked Roy Sheider as the reluctant hero, and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper, who was basically the comedy sidekick, but still a great character. All of them made 'Jaws' not only terrifying, but also a good character development movie.
Of course the best scenes are the very last scenes, which have gone from suspenseful to really suspenseful. My only regret is that so many God awful sequels had to be made. Those are some of the worst movies ever made. 'Jaws', though, is one of my favorite movies. I recommend this to anyone who loves a great man against nature, intense ride, because this is the best of its kind. Jaws is still a timeless classic, and it always will be. 10/10",Null,0,1,28 March 2002

Charlie Sheen has not been in a better movie since. I don't know what it was like in Vietnam, and I'm sure that the terror of all those hundreds of thousands of soldiers would not be able to compare to any movie, but I think Platoon came as close as any movie could get. Willem Defoe dose a great job as Sergeant Elias, but Tom Berenger stole the show as the cold Sergeant Barnes.  The destruction of the small village was almost too hard to watch, and the final battle was intense as well as magnificent.

I was impressed with Johnny Depps' outstanding performance as Jung. Ray Liotta was also superb as George's father Fred.Penelope Cruz does a great job as George's Columbian, blow sniffing, 90 pound wife. She is either very loud and crazy or focused and concentrated in this movie. The movie itself is also masterful. The script is great, the plot is great, especially since it's true, and the way the characters develop is great. One of the things I really liked about this movie is how the first hour is fast and in-your-face, and then the other hour kind of slows down and makes more time for the characters to be recognized. And both the hours were excellent. It gets very good once his daughter is about 12.

","This is an excellent movie all around. This was the era where Harrison Ford was Indiana Jones and Han Solo (those were pretty good movies, though), and it was nice to see a change in pace for the incredibly skilled actor. I thought Harrison Ford did a great job, just because he was an entertaining as well as believable character. I thought Rutger Haur stole the movie, though. Roy Batty was such an interesting character, and Rutger Haur did a great job in animating him to real life. Batty was also a great character because he had feelings and emotions, even though he is a murderous Nexus 6, which is the most superior model of Replicants. He had an interesting sense of humor (he could be pretty funny at parts), and he also developed strong emotions. The ending was my favorite part for many reasons, but most of all for Roy's final monologue.Sean Young and Dearl Hannah (especially Dearl Hannah, and her cool face painting)were also very pleasing in Blade Runner. This movie is great for many reasons, for the great action scenes, for the great acting and dialogue, the bleak waste land of what has become Los Angeles in 2019, and also, and probably most importantly, the philosophical message the film provides us with in the end.Blade Runner is fun for everyone, except people who can't handle even a little violence (it's pretty brief). Ridley Scott usually makes great decisions on movies, which generally turn into hits, and this one is no exception (a great follow up to 'Alien'). Check it out and you won't be let down, unless you want a non stop shoot em' up, because this movie does have a lot of action, but not through out the whole movie.

The Deer Hunter," 'One shot is what it's all about.'
","The Deer Hunter is one of the finest movies ever made. It's not just a Vietnam War movie, it's much more than that. That's one of the reasons I liked this movie so much, it starts out in a small Pennsylvania town, then moves into the the serenity of the Northern Appalachians, then into the deadly jungles of Vietnam.  What makes this film great is that you have already met the characters in the small town, and you've seen them develop, so you already care about them as they enter Vietnam. The films real intensity come when they are forced to play Russian Roulette, those are the hardest scenes to watch. It gets even better when De Niro returns to his home town and is different, much like the town itself. Streep gives an excellent performance as Linda, and De Niro also delivers strong as Michael; but Christopher Walken stole the show. I only had one problem with this movie, and that was the length of the wedding, I think that could have been trimmed down about ten minutes but other than that, I loved it!

The Matrix," Free Your Mind
","This is one of my favorite movies. It is the most intelligent action movie I've ever seen. It's one of those movies that are just fun to watch, because even if you don't get it (I didn't the first time I saw it), you can still enjoy the massive action scenes, the great visual effects, and the amazing choreography of the fight scenes. I also really liked the acting. This is the first Keanu Reeves movie in which I could take him seriously and not see him as the time traveling valley dude Ted (I thought the Bill and Ted movies were very funny though). He is convincing, and he is a likable character, so that makes it all the more enjoyable to watch him undergo the many secrets of the Matrix.Carrie-Anne Moss was also very cool and sexy as Trinity. She has a good deal of talent and I hope type casting doesn't end her career like so many other Sci-Fi movie actors (i.e. Mark Hammel and Roy Schieder). And of course, who could forget the great Laurence Fishburne, who made Morpheus such a cool character. I really think that only Laurence Fishburne could have done such a good job of doing Morpheus. I think this movie is for pretty much everyone. The only people I think that wouldn't like this movie are people that can't handle even a little violence, or are upset at the idea of a bleak future (which is probably where the earth is headed anyway, more or less). It's just a kick ass movie. Check it out. 10/10",Null,0,0,8 December 2001
Casino," Casino, Ca-seen-it
","This movie was better when it was called GoodFellas. Now since Scorsese is such a great director, I figured it would be a good gangster drama, but it was really just a flashier, longer, gorier, dryer version of GoodFellas. Now GoodFellas is my #3 movie, and I guess that I would have liked this film had it had more originality. James Woods and Sharon Stone did a great job in this film, Stone was a very convincing junky, as was Woods. As for De Niro and Pecsi, they've done this sort of thing before. I guess that if my expectations weren't so high for this movie I would have enjoyed it more, because a good deal of the time I enjoy no-brainer action movies, but I was hoping for a good movie, which turned out to be a regurgitated and much less plausible version of Scorsese's classic film.  But it's not all that bad of a film, I mean the flashy images of Las Vegas and the casinos were well shot, and some of the dialogue was good, but I didn't keep me interested for 3 hours. 5/10",Null,0,1,18 July 2001
Heat," 'I do what I do best, I take scores. You do what you do best, you try and stop guys like me.'
","This was an excellent crime drama! Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are face off in the thriller of the decade. This movie has great drama, great dialogue, GREAT action sequences, and great acting. Pacino and De Niro alone make this movie great, but the supporting actors (Val Kilmer Jon Vioght and Tom Sizemore are excellent here), the plot, and the action scenes make this a worthy watch. Sure, this little caper is a little long, but all that extra time was shot for the viewer to get to know the two main characters better, which I think made the movie all the more better. In my opinion, there are three memorable parts: the mesmerizing bank heist, the conversation between the two legendary actors, and the final showdown in the feild next to the airport).The bank heist is possibly the best action scene in movie history. This was the most exciting action scene since the French Connection's train chase. The conversation is a wonderful plot turn, where the two men come to the agreement that only one of them will walk away, and the final scene in the field that is literally feet away from the runway of LAX. The intensity boils in this scene. I really liked this  film, though some didn't, due to the length, but I saw that as bonus footage! 9/10",Null,0,0,26 September 2001
Jackie Brown," 'My ass may be dumb, but I aint no dumb-ass'
","This was a slick, stylish, cool little caper by our friendly neighborhood director Quentin Tarantino, where he takes one of the coolest actresses of all time, Pam Grier, and one of the coolest actors of all time, Samuel L., and an all star cast, including Robert De Niro and Bridget Fonda, and puts them all on the trail of $500,000 in the recreation of Elmor Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch'.I really enjoyed this movie because of the twist and turns, the betrayal, the way Pam Grier figures out how to trick everyone, the parts that you didn't expect, and of course the excellent acting. Also, everyone had a purpose in the plan, and everybody thought they were fooling each-other.You may have to watch this a few times to figure out all of the plans and how they all came together, but you don't have to understand all the little things to understand and enjoy this movie. For those of you who are hoping for a movie that is similar to 'Pulp Fiction', this is not the one you want, because the only similarity between the two films is the great acting and dialogue, which makes this a good movie alone, but for those of you who are looking for an intelligent, witty, violent, and well acted heist movie, this is the one for you! 9/10",Null,0,1,27 July 2001
Gladiator," The Gladiator Who Defied an Empire
","This is an excellent movie. Russell Crowe is awesome as Maximus, the Roman General turned slave, who than becomes the Gladiator that defies an empire. It's tastefully violent, there are good action scenes, but the acting was why I liked this movie. Russell Crowe was convincing as a vengeful gladiator who wants revenge from the new emperor Commodus, who kills anyone who stands in his way of being Rome's greatest emperor.Joaquin Phoenix was a good villain as Commodus, and Connie Nielsen was also good as Commodus' terrified sister, Lucilla. There are great special effects, great costumes, great acting, and a great story.This is a good and exciting movie that you can watch for the action or drama. I found it was funner to watch it as an action/drama, which made it all the more enjoyable. This is one of my favorite movies, and I recommend it to anyone who like the above description, because I know I do. Besides, how many other award winning movies can you see a guy get his head cut off with a large sword (not including Braveheart, because that wasn't a sword)! 9/10",Null,0,0,16 August 2001
Donnie Darko," 'i'll tell you what he said. he asked me to forcebly insert the life-line activity into my anus!'
","every few years you get a movie that doesn't do very well yet far surpasses everything that people and critics, and Donnie Darko is one of them. this is probably my new favorite movie, and it's certainly one of the best movies in the last 10 years. Donnie Darko combines three elements, dram comedy and science fiction. now usually movies like this suck horribly, but instead of trying to force all three types to work at the same time, but this movie gives you the intense drama, some breathing room with some really funny parts, and than gives you some scientific bits that are really interesting.jake gyllenhaal was perfect for the roll of Donnie Darko. he is truly one of the best actors of this generation. jena malone also does a great job as Donnie's love interest who has her own set of problems (seems like most of her characters do). this is also a very clever movie. it gives you a lot to think about, and it is one of those endings where you could argue with some one about possible outcomes for a long time. one thing that i really liked was the humor. it is really unique, because the funny parts generally come in a serious setting (like the line above was delivered by Donnie's spastic gym teacher who is upset by the fact that donnie told her to shove a book up her ass).every person i have watched this with has loved it. i think it's just one of those movies that most people like, yet not many know of it. i guess if this movie had been over promoted that it wouldn't have that sort of independent feel to it. i usually hate 80's music, but the song 'mad world' worked very well at the end. an all around great movie. i recommend it to everyone. 10/10",Null,3,5,21 July 2003
Born on the Fourth of July," All around, a pretty good movie
","This was a pretty good movie, not Oliver Stones best, but still pretty good. Tom Cruise did an extraordinary job as Ron Kovic, as did Willem Defoe as Charlie, and Stone's directing tricks were masterful, but the film lacked the edge of Stone's other movies like Platoon and Talk Radio.>My only real problem with this was the middle stretch, because to me it kind of dragged on for a while, but the Vietnam scenes were powerful and haunting, but when Ron came back home the film just sort of stood still for half an hour, but other than that, it was a good movie. 7/10",Null,0,0,24 July 2001
Goodfellas," Funny How? Am I a clown! Do I amuse you!!
","Wow! This was an excellent flick! It's in my top 5 movies! Everyone is perfect in this film. Joe Pecsi steals the show, and is at his best in this movie, in his absolutely off the wall performance as Tommy! As usual, De Niro is also superb, as the cool gangster Jimmy Conway. Ray Liotta has never been better. The best gangster film of both the 80's and 90's!         Martin Scorsese has made the best films over the past three decades, and this is one of them. My only complaint is that it only got one Oscar, when it should have gotten more (although De Niro did a better job in Awakenings which was made in the same year, which he should have gotten best actor), but other wise, this film is a masterpiece!",Null,0,0,2 May 2001
Jurassic Park," 'Uh, they're flocking this way!'
","This is one of the best sci-fi thrillers ever made, and by far the best dinosaur movie ever made. The visual effects are top of the line, especially since it was one of the first to use computer effects.The T-Rex was terrifying, as were the raptors. The best and most intense scene was the part in the kitchen with the raptors. When I first went to see this, I did not expect such a great sci-fi/horror, but that's what I got. 9/10",Null,0,1,23 July 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," 'I want Dapper Dan! I'm a Dapper Dan man!'
","This was a very funny movie. George Clooney is very funny, as were John Turturro, and especially Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar. The three characters run into so many mishaps in the span of less than a week, that can't help but laugh. George Clooney was the funniest because people never saw him in a comedy, and all of the large words that he misused made him very funny.This is one of my favorite movies, and one of my top favorite comedies. There are many different types of comedy in this film, like slap-stick, subtlety, memorable one-liners, and strange situations. I think that this is funnier than Razing Arizona, but not by a very high margin.
So in closing, this is a good family comedy, if your family can handle some mild profanity. 10/10",Null,0,0,29 July 2001
The Godfather," He made us a movie we couldn't refuse!
","This movie is questionably the best ever made. It's in my top five (at #4). #4 my seem a little high, but Scorsese slid into #1, #2, and #3. Anyway, this movie was fantastic. Francis Ford Coppala has made the most memorable movie in movie history. That's a croc that Pacino didn't get best supporting actor, or Coppala getting best director. Oh well. There's not a whole lot else to say, great plot, great acting, great character development, great movie! 10/10",9,1,3,8 July 2001
