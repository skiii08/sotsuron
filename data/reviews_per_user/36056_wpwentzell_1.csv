Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Poor storytelling ruins the otherwise fun backstory
","I think most users giving this high marks probably watched this film before they saw the original trilogy. I'm guessing most of these people are millennials or Gen Z, having watched these films in the theater when younger. Too bad they missed out on the emotional, driven storytelling that made the original trilogy a legacy. Without that storytelling, these prequels would have never happened.In this installment, we get CGI galore, with stunning but heartless and mundane visuals. We get characters devoid of proper development or emotion. Even the story is not convincing. RedLetterMedia has a great critique of the prequels on YouTube. I invite all you youngsters to watch it, it'll make it clear as day why these films are just bland as burned toast, and don't hold a candle to the original trilogy that made these possible.",4,2,3,29 May 2020
