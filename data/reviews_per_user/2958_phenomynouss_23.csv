The New World," Not a film
","I decided to chance it one day and go see 'The New World' because it had one of my most respected actors in it (Colin Farrel and Christopher Plummer) and it looked quite good, since there were very few realistic colonial-era movies of the subject.What I saw in the theater was not a film.It felt like a pretentious art student's college film trying so hard to be blasé and chic and all those fancy crazy words with obscure meanings that scream 'creative' and fumbles like a giant tumbling off a cliff.First off, the sparse dialogue. There's hardly much dialogue in any scene minus a few lines spoken by a character off-camera or for a few shots on camera. If all the dialogue were put together and single-spaced, it'd take up at most five pages of the script. The sparse dialogue isn't even memorable or deeply moving! It's just blandly stating the obvious like 'we're here in the new world.' 'the natives are savages' 'it's been three days.' So where does most of the movie go if there's virtually no dialogue? Cinematography. I rate this two stars only because it looked authentic. The vast majority of the camera and film was devoted to cinematography and just filming trees and grass swaying in the wind and birds and indians frolicking like playful little things.The young new actress playing Pocahantas (who isn't even named in the film, we just assume she's Pocahantas) is really uneventful and unfulfilling, and a bore to look at. At least Colin Farrel tries hard in his role, whereas Christopher Plummer doesn't look too anxious and seems glad to be rid of himself by the middle of the movie.The latter half takes place in England, where Pocahantas ends up with another colonist. It's equally silent there dialogue-wise, and very uneventful save for a silent meeting with the King and Queen and a frolic through the vast maze gardens of the palace's backyard.So in total, the movie consisted of Pocahantas frolicking, and some scenes with the white men and indians looking concerned and the occasional spoken word or gunfire. But mostly frolicking.",2,1,7,8 May 2006
Alexander," With all its flaws and everyone's hatred, I simply love it
","I was impressed when I first saw Alexander on the screen. This was before I was obsessed with ancient Greek and Roman history. Then re-seeing it, I fell in love with it, original theatrical cut. The Director's cut was okay, but not better than the original.I recently recognized the flaws which detracted some people from it, such as lack of characterization of some of the minor characters, a seeming characterization of Alexander based on his flaws rather than his greatness, and so on. However, I don't think this is enough to detract my intense love for the movie.I think Oliver Stone is a cinematic genius, and it shows in his work like Platoon and Natural Born Killers. The direction is brilliant, and the incredible detail put into cinematography, costumes, and sets is simply epic on its own scale.The Battle of Gaugamela sequence is pure brilliance, and I believe the most accurate ancient battle portrayal in all Hollywood. Aside from occasional lapses in which a Phalanx is broken apart, men fight in formation, rather than wandering around the field on their own, picking on-on-one 'The Mummy Returns' style battles.The acting is perhaps some of the best I've ever seen. Colin Farrel dissolves so fully into his role, that it's impossible for me to see the man playing Alexander as the man who played a slick New York agent in 'Phone Booth', or a deadpan bald villain with a raspy voice in 'Daredevil'. Val Kilmer so fully becomes Philip of Macedon that you can't see him doing any other role. He's no longer Val Kilmer underneath the scarred eyelid and thick beard, he's Philippos II of Makedon.The lesser-known actors, Jared Leto who plays Hephaistion, Gary Stretch who plays Cleitus the Black, and all the others playing the likes of Crateros, young Ptolemaios, Nearkhos, they are so fluid in their roles that they could quite possibly be the actual characters they portray, Irish and British accents and all.The 'Clash with Cleitus' scene is so thickly potent with chemistry between Farrel and Stretch (Cleitus) that it sends shivers through my spine listening to how these two rail at each other, and how literate, yet scathing and understandable Cleitus is. His vocabulary is like poetry, like Sophokles' writing, and yet his message is so simple and human that it's universally understood, even if you don't speak the language.Inaccuracies aside (they had to cut and condense scenes for time, including a simplification of the Battle of Hydaspes, which Stone himself acknowledges, due to the vast complexity of the actual battle), it's one of the more accurate Hollywood movies about Ancient Greece, and an epic in its own right. Love it or hate it, it IS an epic.The Final Cut expands upon it even more, and re-arranges scenes so that the lead-up to the Battle of Gaugamela comes first, after the scene of his death and Ptolemaios (Ptolemy)'s brief introduction. Scene re-sorting aside, new scenes show a more benevolent Alexander, working to bring Phoenicians in to build Babylon's shallow water harbor, granting gifts to his friends and soldiers, freeing Darius's harem slaves and eunuchs, granting great honors on his conquered enemies, including a scene with Oxyhartes(sp), father of Roxane. Important scenes, such as the clash with Cleitus, are expanded with more dialogue, more action before and after scenes to provide a more solid foundation for the coming events, and such, adding more depth to some, and more reasoning to others.The Final Cut doesn't radically change the movie, but it solidifies some shaky foundations, and fixes some, but not all, of the flaws with the original cut. The subplot with Cassander and Roxane, mentioned by Stone in the original commentary, is missing, as is the conflict with Cleitus and Hephaistion.",10,0,9,21 February 2006
Troy," Terrible film.. only given two stars because it looks like it cost some money
","When I first saw the preview, I thought 'What a fantastic idea!' movies about Ancient Greece seemed rare to me (not being a fanatic, or knowing of the older movies)I knew once the movie was over that it was very poor... and it took me a few more viewings to realize how horrible it was.First off, the music is all middle-eastern sounding. I realize Troy is in western Asia-ish (like around ancient Pergamum and such) and such, but come one, this music sounded like a day in the deserts of Arabia. More suited for Kingdom of Heaven or Hidalgo.Historical accuracy? You'd find more of that in a nervous Christian book about procreation. Agammemnon and Menelaus are portrayed as fat greedy pricks interested only in themselves, the Trojans portrayed as noblemen and upright in every way (even Paris, who in mythology, was a sly prick), and Achilles as a moody dick! He's stubborn and arrogant and stuck-up and very very rude, like when he told that poor boy in Thessalonica, 'That's why no one will remember your name' when the boy said he was afraid of the Thessalonicans or something. The battle which was supposed to be 10 years, seemed to last less than a month, with most of that time being the 12 days they gave peace for Hector's death! In the entire movie, none of the characters change in appearance---Peter O'Toole's Priam looks on the verge of death, without any change, Agammemnon doesn't gray, no one changes in what is supposed to be 10 years, and the way the movie passes makes it seem like each passing day is just that; one passing day. Agammemnon and Menelaus survive in mythology, yet both die in this movie, probably because they were the 'bad guys' in the film.This is a big one: Mythology. This movie seems to spit in the face of mythology, use Homer's book pages as toilet paper for their crony ass, and then throw up venom on the sheer 'coolness' of the legend of Troy. The legend of Achilles being immortal and his only weakness being his heel is defecated upon, when Paris shoots Achilles through the heel, we think 'OMG! the legend! His heel is his only weak spot!' hence the term 'Achilles Heel' meaning our weakness... Then Achilles gets shot five times in the chest. -.- So to the average viewer, who knows nothing about Achilles's legend, what do you think kills Achilles, a shot in the heel, or five shots in the chest?That plus the callous way in which the director--through characters like Hector and Achilles and such--seem to treat the Gods like crap, and doesn't portray their influence at all (in mythology, they have LOTS of influence in the battle), as opposed to say Alexander, which isn't supposed to have God influence, but shows hints of Zeus watching over him (the Eagle). The Trojans constantly claim the Gods are on their side, and the pompous way in which they say it seems to make you envision the director going 'Pfft, what jackasses! believing in the Gods of their time, HAH! Jesus Christ our lord and savior is the only God and THEY should've known that! So they die for their heresy! DIE DIE DIE!' A bit of an exaggeration on my part, but that basic idea.Another big problem is something that also messed up the game Warcraft III. It is TOO HERO-BASED. In the movie, so much emphasis is placed on heroes like Achilles and Hector, that the armies pretty much play absolutely no role at all in the movie! It doesn't matter that the Greeks outnumber the Trojans 2 or 3 to 1, they absolutely can't win without Achilles!!! It doesn't matter that the Trojans are defended by epic walls and the best archers in the world, they can't win without Hector!!!All in all, a very poor put-together movie, with a kind of stubborn negative and childish mentality towards the ways, beliefs, and customs of the times, pretty much re-writing the legend of Troy to make it more sell-able to dumb audiences who want to gawk at Brad Pitt naked (yes, he's naked several times for no real reason) and the amount of men they can cram into one shot. The acting is wooden, and hearing Achilles whine and sass like a snotty teenage girl just irritates, the characters are portrayed all wrong, the Gods and the Myths aren't just ignored---they're subliminally cursed and treaded and defecated upon. The legend was torn open, the parts the director liked picked apart, and made more Hollywood-friendly to be commercialized.",2,2,11,23 December 2005
Romeo + Juliet," A surprisingly original idea
","In my personal opinion, I believe Shakespeare's writing is way too obscure and out there, and think those people who say 'Shakespeare wrote for the common people' and such are either blatantly lying to us schoolchildren, or I can only cringe in terror at what plays written for educated people must have sounded like.This movie doesn't change the dialect or dialog of the movie, and gives it a weird sort of artistic modern setting, which makes it not only a surprising and original twist, but makes it much more watchable to see a timeless tale truly tested with its claim to timelessness. Even if it took place in the year 3010 AD, it'd still be the same.I love the way the adults on the newscasts and police speak, and the way the police officer at the end of the movie scolds the Capulets and Montagues, and the beginning scene, with the Montague nerds biting their thumbs at the Capulets was amusing.The guy who plays Mercutio (I think he also plays Link in the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions) is spellbinding, and John Leguizamo is equally spectacular in this movie.What keeps this movie from a 9 or a 10 in my opinion is the two lead characters played abysmally by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. DiCaprio, normally a great actor, sounds like he's just memorized the lines and is reciting them like a schoolchild forced to read them aloud in class--lifeless, with little to no emotion, and an apparent lack of understanding as to what he is saying.Claire Danes is even worse, delivering lines in such an awkward manner as to make me cringe. It sounds literally like a giggly, bubbly school girl reading from a script for the first time while distracted by something else.Another thing which surprisingly irritated me was the SCREAMING. In many scenes, there was mindless screaming at the hands of Juliet's mother and maid, especially that scene where Romeo is at Juliet's window, and the maid calls for her, and Danes (awkwardly) says 'By and by I come', the maid's line is literally *takes deep breath*:JULIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!for at the very least, 5-10 seconds longThere's a lot more screaming at the maid's hand and Juliet's mother, though thankfully it's limited just to that scene and scarcely any other. But it is SERIOUSLY annoying having her scream like that when Juliet is CLEARLY shouting back 'By and by I come'",8,0,1,4 October 2006
Quantum of Solace," Ponderous in being slightly opaque
","Even now I can't fully describe just how or why Quantum of Solace is an 'inferior' Bond film, save for a fact that it seems to put more emphasis on one chase sequence or another in a gritty sort of way that would almost seem to step into the empty-headed vomit-inducing-camera-shaking of a 'spy thriller' like the Bourne Identity, and yet manages to maintain its own identity (no pun) as a Bond film of this 'new' Bond era.The main prevailing error or issue in the film is the seemingly gaping disconnect between two plot lines that run throughout the movie. The micro-story of Bond wanting revenge on -someone- (not even really explained who) over Vesper's problems leading to her self-sacrificing suicide, and the fear by M and MI6 that Bond is letting his emotions destroy his subtlety and skill as an agent, and instead opt to barrel through enemies aimlessly and kill anyone he wants (spoiler alert: he doesn't do any of that).While we are probably supposed to believe that Bond is driven to stopping Dominic Green (Matthieu Amalric) in whatever his dastardly plan with Bolivia is, the key issue here is that the two plot lines have almost no connection whatsoever, and that Vesper's sacrifice seemingly has nothing to do with Quantum or its schemes. I say 'seemingly' because the movie very clearly shows the opposite, but does not show exactly HOW she has to do with Quantum's schemes. She's just an opaque plothole that may or may not be a red herring. Bond shows absolutely no emotion over her save for a few minor scenes, usually involving Mathis or Camille, of which there are not nearly enough of these to give any justification of this sense of a need for revenge.At no point in time is it ever explicitly explained or mentioned just why Bond is so 'devoted' to stopping Dominic Green beyond the fact that it's his assignment to do so. Very early on it is revealed that he, along with Mr. White and countless others from big-name diplomats to nameless henchmen, are part of a secret organization devoted to -something- (not even really explained what). The only memorably line about Quantum is Mr. White joking to the degree of 'Here we are afraid to say too much over the phone thinking the CIA and MI6 are listening in on every word when you don't even know we exist!' Aside from the seeming infiltration of people on almost every level in every organization criminal and political, in an almost sort of Illuminati sort of way, Quantum really does nothing but remain a nameless cloud over which it apathetically watches things happen and occasionally puts its own people out of their misery when they are on the brink of death and/or about to reveal too much about them or break them out of the situation. Even Mr. White gets away alive and unpunished.Dominic Green also appears to be so completely out of his element that everything about him just screams 'nameless minion' from the beginning. He doesn't even seem to be sane, as he constantly fills the screen with bug-eyed expressions of frozen-stupid, like a mix of Barty Grouch Jr. in Harry Potter, and Grima Wormtongue in Lord of the Rings, only without as much to do. The only time Green appears remotely human is when he gives a speech or talks with a Bolivian general, in which in either case it seems clear that he's been prepped with a pre-written speech or protocol by other members of Quantum.Dominic's entire hare-brained scheme is also another dangling plot-hole in the making that never really seems important even though the entire movie is focused on it; it first throws off the viewer into thinking it involves exploiting untapped oil resources in a Bolivian desert, then is later revealed that there is no oil there, and that Green's plan is little more than to dam up the underwater aquifers in Bolivia and force a drought on the country, before literally pulling out and doing the same elsewhere while the international community deals with Bolivia's problems. There's nothing else in the plan aside from that, and I fail to see any conceivable way that this would make any lasting money beyond a few millions made screwing investors out of oil and pipeline money.Green proves on multiple occasions to be just as dumb and incompetent as a campy Bond villain of old, most memorably in which he is leaving an opera with a group of investors, and catches Bond in a hallway, after an earlier scene in which he ordered Bond to be killed. Not only does Green freeze up and stare at Bond for what feels like 30 seconds, but he proceeds to do absolutely nothing to stop him short of sending only two guards to have a shootout with him which obviously fails.What is then left in the film is a piece of poor exposition tied around multiple action sequences that ultimately have a sense of confusion attached to them. What is most stunning is how Casino Royale had viewers on the edge of their seat with the mere action of a POKER GAME and yet the colossal boat chases and roof-top acrobatics and down-hill car-flipping chases have people on the back of their seats, placidly staring and wondering what is happening, why it's happening, and when Bond will do something 007-y instead of just being a generic pawn in a gigantic action sequence that could just as easily be slipped into a bland straight-to-DVD movie without much trouble.In totality, there's barely half a movie here, with enough explosions and guns and fighting to fill in the rest for time, making it the shortest Bond movie, but nowhere near the worst, as the -potential- story lines set up for future entries are good enough on their own to not be a total failure.",6,1,4,24 November 2008
Gone with the Wind," Long and laborious, and so very stupid... how is this a classic?
","This is another of those movies I wonder 'HOW is this a classic?'. Maybe the book was a lot better than the movie! I was watching this, not expecting much, but expecting to earn my respect, the way 'Scarface' or 'Casablanca', movies I don't like but have earned my respect as classic movies.It didn't. Apart from the 20 minute 'Overture' sequence involving a painting of a sky, the words 'Overture' and the canned music of a symphony orchestra playing random notes, which really annoyed me ><, the movie really was a load of crap that just looked good and colorful.The story was a long and winding tale about a girl Scarlett O'Hara complaining and whining about her pampered, sheltered little life while men are off dying in the Civil War fighting for the Confederacy, and she falls in love with a scoundrel blockade runner (sounds like something out of Star Wars) named Brett Butler or something.The movie goes on fairly well, impressing me with its simplicity and its strict sticking to the plot of Scarlett and Brett trying to stick together while their society crumbles as the Union starts to win and invade the South.Then comes the climax, when Brett is finally reunited with Scarlett, and the most disastrous turn in movie history happens... in the midst of their crumbling society, with the Confederacy pushed down to the brink, the Union swarming over their town, and fires blazing in the background... Brett decides to join the Confederacy. After YEARS of avoiding service. Scarlett asks him what we're all asking the screen: 'WHY?!' 'WHY?!WHY?!WHY?!WHY?!WHY?!' And do you know what his response is?!?!: 'I've always been a sucker for lost causes' That killed the movie right there. I stopped watching after that. I know there was another 30 minute interlude scene of a painting of a dusk sky and a symphony warming up. Then it goes on with Scarlett living in the burnt out shell of her house, growing food, killing Union soldiers come to rape her or some cliché thing like that, and helping one of her slaves give birth, while waiting for Brett to come home.Worst movie ever.",1,28,82,14 May 2006
No Country for Old Men," Wasn't that good
","I was not biased against the film when I saw it. I loved 'The Big Lebowski', and was even amused by the similar theme in the two: both involve a suitcase full of money which the main character carts around, for events to get the suitcase lost, and inevitably leave the audience in the dark as to the eventual fate of the money.Unfortunately, as great as the movie started out, it devolved into pretentious art-film-like movie-making and a muddled ending with no clear ending. Not defined ending or happy ending, but CLEAR ending. The whole thing came to an abrupt end like a train that hits an invisible wall at low speed.The cinematography was something worth an Oscar in itself, and I especially loved the way it was shot when Llewellyn discovered the botched drug deal and eventually the money. It was so realistic, you could almost feel the mucky grime of blood drying in the sand or the greasiness of an overused dump-truck, the plainness of the brand-less milk, all the homey settings of a western border-city.The character Llewellyn isn't very likable. He reminds me something of The Dude in that he's very much aloof to the horrors of seeing the shot-up drug dealers, and casually takes their money and goes home, suddenly remembering one of the dying men asked him for water, and deciding to go back with a gallon of tap water for him, until Anton Shigurh comes after him and he panics, and is forced to become resolute.In the beginning, Anton Shigurh, played by Javier Bardem, seemed the ideal villain; quiet, utterly irredeemable, seeming the kind of person who would kill someone at any moment without any sort of honor. Even the scene where he makes a shopkeep gamble on his life with the flip of his coin, you fully expect Anton to kill him at any moment, even when he lets the man live.At about the mid-way point of the movie, it starts to unravel. Perhaps I need to see the movie again, but for the life of me, I cannot begin to wonder what Tommy Lee Jones's character's purpose in the movie is. He promises Llewellyn's wife that he'll make sure Llewellyn lives, and goes about doing nothing but reading the newspaper and lounging about in the office or at a diner. Only once does he visit the crime scene, and towards the end does he come close to the killer.Next come the nameless character played by Woody Harrelson, and the oh-so-elegantly named 'Man in the Office' played by Stephen Root. Woody Harrelson's character describes Anton for us, and then wanders off to meet with Llewellyn, and then get killed by Anton for some reason. Anton then randomly appears in the Office man's office and kills him in the middle of interviewing some guy for a job. Anton doesn't say anything of worth to the other man, and is then back to the western area chasing Llewellyn. I have no idea what that was supposed to be about.The thing is a mess, as the movie skips ahead slightly with Llewellyn dead, and Anton flustered that he lost the money. In a moment that completely changes my opinion of Anton from cold, calculating, assassin of pure evil, to a pitiful, pathetic, stubborn childish creature that kills Llewellyn's wife just because Llewellyn didn't let Anton kill him.For some random reason, as Anton is driving off from her house, he gets hit by a car, staggers out with a broken arm, and walks away.For another random reason, Tommy Lee Jones's character has some retrospect, then gives a long, rambling soliloquy about a dream he had. I have heard many accents, and I have very sharp hearing. I can understand some of the most rambling of mumblings and mutterings, but for the life of me, I could not understand more than a few words of Tommy Lee Jones's heavily accented, mumbling, rambling speech about dreaming about his father.And it suddenly ended with 'And then I woke up.'",1,63,110,2 March 2008
District 9," A movie about people
","It sounds simplistic, but really, in a situation that was so set up, the movie did spectacularly in focusing on the main plot line while keeping the background story adequately explained without overwhelming the main story. Never is there a point where Wikus Van Der Merwe and someone else bring the movie to a grinding halt with expository narrative like 'You know, 20 years ago when this first started...' The trailers gave us what appeared to be a faux-documentary style, involving a modern-day Apartheid... with aliens. That alone would get my butt in a theater seat. Holy hell.In a time period where unique and genuinely great and entertaining movies are a scarcity, this one is a welcome blessing. I hate to do this, but I feel forced to; 'Avatar', nearly $300 million dollars to make has some of the best and most realistic CGI ever. And it has a story a 4th grader would find lame and stupid.It's story is not unique, not good, not interesting, full of stale cliché's, total lack of surprises, and a tiresome Human-bashing with a glorification of Na'vi culture that is a near perfect mirror for Native American societies before we extinguished them as the evil creatures we were.This movie, meanwhile, is wholly unique, as much as it can be in a day and age where the audience has seen pretty much everything. The setup is right there: Aliens come to Earth as refugees, and rather than go to the stereotypical places of New York or London or Los Angeles, they end up in... Johannesburg, South Africa.After the initial awe of first contact fades, these aliens become the source of most all racial hatreds of the local residences. The story is right in front of it: Wikus Van Der Merwe, set up as a doofy, bright-eyed, largely average and sheepish worker for MNU, the company tasked with caring for these aliens (who are revealed to not be very bright, and thought to be proverbial 'worker ants' of a hive-mind society, or else the slaves/lower classes). The movie begins with a documentary which right away foreshadows exactly what will happen, in a brilliant way that neither draws suspicion nor gives anything away. Wikus seems inexplicably villainized by some of the documentary people for reasons you assume to be due to him being MNU, or being stupid, or making enemies or such.Turns out, he's married the daughter of MNU's boss, and thus cries of NEPOTISM can be raised when he's put in charge of a vast eviction of the alien inhabitants of District 9. The eviction scenes are where the movie's only humor comes, easy and naturally, as Wikus and a co-worker, and a genial, fat MNU soldier go hut to hut trying to get the aliens (called 'Prawns') to sign them. Rather than show us every single one, they separate some of them with convenient and brilliantly paced and placed bits of exposition, with documentary-style narrative of how the Prawns have existed, how they're treated over the years, how they've committed acts of violence, and how District 9 has attracted gangsters, primarily Nigerian, and how they exploit the Prawn's love of cat food by selling them the stuff in exchange for alien weapons and technology, though this technology is somehow bioengineered to work only for the Prawns. By the time the end of the eviction scenes comes, you're filled in with huge amounts of information, most from these asides, some from Wikus explaining things to his co-worker buddy.The chemistry Sharlto has with the two of them is shockingly good, considering he's never acted before, save for a few seconds in Neil Blomkamp's short film 'Alive in Joburg', which District 9 is actually based upon. His natural charm and humor is a welcome relief from even atrocities such as a Prawn ripping off a soldier's arm, then being shot to death, or a hut full of Prawn eggs being exterminated with a flamethrower, while Wikus jokes that their deaths sound like popcorn popping.Probably one of the best things about the film is that it doesn't give us a trite, stale, and boring bit of character 'development' or sudden shocking change or try to make Wikus perfect for the audience's sensibilities (which is exactly what 'Avatar' does). Wikus curses a lot. Wikus is just as racist towards the aliens as the average person. He regularly calls them Prawns, calls them 'Fookin' creatures' when accusations are made that he had sex with one of them, he is mean and nasty to some of the Prawns that get unruly or uppity during the eviction, and threatens to take away CJ's son when he throws a lollipop at Wikus's head.Even when Christopher is trying to help him, Wikus remains racist. It isn't until the end that he comes to realize that Christopher is his friend. Even then, we aren't given any 'big revelation' moment to show that he's changed. Well... we are, but not in that way! Puns ahoy~! It's violent, gory, has 'foul' language, and it will make you cry. It is also one of the best movies of the year, potentially of the decade.And it bears mentioning... Avatar put on a visual spectacle for $300 million that turned out to be a colorful Candyland version of 'Dances With Wolves' without any of the compelling drama. District 9 more than exceeds it at literally 1/10th the budget. And while there wasn't as much CG, it bears mentioning that the Prawns are ALL CG, and they look just as realistic as any creature in Avatar---perhaps even more so.",10,1,3,30 January 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The bloat starts to set in
","I absolutely love long movies. I hate seeing book adaptations slashed to 90 or 120 minute things, and thus am thrilled by such movies like 'Gettysburg' which turned a 350+ page book into a 4 hour and 10 minute movie, and thus was able to cover essentially everything in the book.For a series like Lord of the Rings, where the movies tend to drone on for many many hours, the length is in some cases justified. For 'The Hobbit' I figured 2 movies should be more than enough for a tight, thrilling adventure.But whereas the first movie managed to be fun despite the overly long dinner sequence and other scenes that meandered on, this one gorges itself on pointless dialogue and sprawling scenes that could have been cut down substantially or cut out entirely, and the movie suffers for it.By my own admission, I don't particularly like Tolkien or the LOTR movies---I think the themes are overly simplistic, the action overly 'Hollywood', and the dialogue is stilted, dumb, and often grueling to sit through, but for a kid's thing, or as a solely visual thing, it's great and entertaining. And yet I thoroughly enjoyed The Two Towers and the first Hobbit movie despite this.By comparison, The Desolation of Smaug feels like the last hour of 'Return of the King' spread over 2 hours, with action sequences littered in. And it's more than just 'Great scene, long droning exposition, good scene, bad scene, good scene'---the 'bloat' is spread almost evenly throughout the entire movie. Virtually every scene goes on at least a few minutes more than it should, like a hair stylist leaving a long luxurious mane of hair rife with split ends and not bothering to clip them off. Even the 'big reveal' of the Necromancer being Sauron (not a spoiler) went on just a few seconds too long, and whilst I previously mention I don't particularly like LOTR, I was blown away by the spectacle of the reveal, only to have it ruined when it went on long enough for me to realize, 'it's like the White Stripes' video for 'Seven Nation Army'' The confrontation between Bilbo and Smaug is tense and thrilling to watch for all of 5 minutes, and yet it keeps going and starts to become repetitive and dull. At the very least, Smaug openly says he's having fun so you can't bitterly ask 'Why doesn't he just kill Bilbo already?' but then this escalates into an even longer sequence (the molten gold plot) that, whether it was accurate to the book or not, could have been completely removed without hurting the movie in the slightest. It seems to even acknowledge what a waste the whole sequence was when Smaug shakes off the gold completely.Another big complaint I have, which is rather unfair given that it was the same in the LOTR series; the battles. So much emphasis---much more than even LOTR, since they had Uruk-Hai---the Orcs are trumped up as this unbelievable scourge of death and destruction that is seemingly unstoppable, and yet in every single battle scenes, the 'good guys' easily waste Orcs with such immense ease that they never break a sweat.In fact, the only surprising battle sequence is the brief fight between Legolas and Bolg, because Legolas actually ends up with a slight nosebleed at the end of it. That's about as far as any character in The Hobbit has come in the way of having any trouble fighting off the hordes of Orcs. It makes them look like piles of crap, and strains credulity when you have Thranduil panicking hard enough to close the borders of Mirkwood out of fear of the Orcs when the only Elves that get killed by Orcs are the ones taken by surprise.It's been more than ten years since I last read The Hobbit, so I don't remember much at all or how it unfolds past Smaug. I only hope for the sake of the audience that all the sluggish doting on the story and Middle-Earth lore was done here, and 'There and Back Again' is at least as tight and thrilling as the first Hobbit movie was.",4,2,4,31 December 2013
2012," Sick stuff
","This is no award-winning movie, with strengths in acting or story or the like. It's essentially the latest 'stuff blowing up' movie by Roland Emmerich, who makes these movies regularly, for money.However, something about this movie makes it stand out particularly dreadfully from most others of the same genre. The introductory sequence of LA breaking apart is full of shots of people in cars as their cars are destroyed, people being killed as stuff knocks them around, and shots of huge skyscrapers crumbling and tumbling, and quick shots of people inside the wreckage, clinging to things helplessly.It's almost impossible for me to watch. It's too traumatizing, too sickening, and cannot be properly tempered by the fact that it's all just CGI fiction. The fact is, the shots of people bear a far too striking resemblance to the scenes from September 11th 2001, where we saw people jumping out of the towers to their inevitable deaths.But enough of that. On the brighter side, as I've noticed with '10,000 BC', Roland Emmerich is very good with broader story lines, and very bad with smaller story lines involving individual people. The concept of the Arks and everything after the initial 'stuff blowing up' parts are decent enough, but the individual characters are one-dimensional archetypes you've seen in pretty much all his movies and others.Oliver Platt's character is the stereotypical 'bad guy' because he's the voice of reason, taken to the extreme of cold logic and rationality at the expense of human lives---the Superego. He justifies the fact that the majority of those being saved in the Arks are the very rich, because without their money supporting it, the project would never have gotten started. There's Chiwetel Ejiofor's character, the opposite of him, the Id, who mopes constantly and contradicts the 'bad guy' with emotion and humanity. There's the bumbling fat foreign guy and his trophy wife, whom he betrays and leaves for dead, only to be betrayed in turn by her later on. There's the dorky science guy, played in the exact same vein as Dr. Phlox from Star Trek Enterprise (obviously it's the same actor) by John Billingsley Amazingly (for a movie like this) there are inklings of contradictions in some characters---tendencies for them to act outside of their archetypes, but these are few and far between. Speaking of which, plenty of dialogue is stupid and cliché'd, like 'who would have thought the crazies with the cardboard signs would be right?' and the scenes not involving the Arks or the 'stuff blowing up' is largely boring and filler.Amazingly again, just a few superficial changes, particularly involving characterization, would have made this movie uniquely different from others of the same genre, and probably worth 3 or 4 stars out of 5. But it's not, and it doesn't.",3,1,2,3 November 2010
The Number 23," 'Topsy Kretts'
","The pseudonym of the in-movie book is 'Topsy Kretts', and no one says or reacts in any way to this until near the end when walter finally figures out it's a fake name as in 'top secrets' I feel like I shouldn't have to say anything else to insinuate how bad this movie is, but IMDb doesn't allow reviews this short.The numerology conspiracy involving the number '23' is one which briefly frightened me as a child and one possibly ripe for some manner of fun thrills. Instead, all the numerology fixation focuses instead on a specific storyline with the author of the book writing a story about murder and romance with some guy named 'Fingerling' that Walter finds eerily reminiscent of himself in some conspiratorial way and he starts having nightmares about it or something.skipping past all that it's revealed he himself was the writer of the book, killed his girlfriend at the time, then tried to kill himself but ended up with plot-specific amnesia before taking on a new persona while in the hospital and marrying his nurse. he then turns himself in for the old murder and goes to prison",1,2,3,2 December 2017
Gran Torino," Easily funnier than any comedy, heartbreaking and heartwarming
","I wouldn't know how to start in heaping more and more praise on a movie like this. This was the sort of movie that cinema is made for. Even being a hard R-rated dramatic character study, it manages to be not just lightly humorous, but outright laugh-out-loud hilarious in almost every scene, without ever disrupting the tone of the movie or the mood.The film is indeed about Walt Kowalski, which Clint Eastwood plays in a way not far from the movie personas that made him famous, and yet easily encompassing how someone would imagine someone like Dirty Harry as an 80+ year old man. He seems as though he's not 'Clint Eastwood playing a crusty old racist' but rather 'A crusty old racist playing himself'. No matter how many racist terms he tosses out, it's always in a way that doesn't seem in any way out of the ordinary or like too much of a step for Eastwood to draw out in his acting.And so many of the scenes from the snarling stares given to his family and friends during his wife's funeral, to chewing out priest Janovich, sparring with Sue back and forth, there's always hilarity to be had when he starts growling or mumbling something in a voice close to Batman in 'The Dark Knight'.Yet despite his cantankerousness, racism, and stubborn need to be self-sufficient, he never ventures into the realm of disgusting or (overly)violent; he seems just as ready to string out a racist rant against ghetto-looking street thugs as he is against sheet-wearing hillbillies.The burgeoning friendship that builds between Walt and Thao is sweet without stepping into being saccharine, and the climax of the film is intense, causing a great change in Walt that would seem fully unexpected in a movie character, yet in this context is not only done brilliantly, but Clint Eastwood develops his character so thoroughly, that he becomes the character as deeply and richly as Daniel Day-Lewis did Daniel Plainview in 'There Will Be Blood': You fully believe Walt Kowalski could be a real person. He is in no way a hero or a villain, but just a normal person.To the end of the film, Walt remains an unrepentant racist and bitter, cantankerous old man hateful of almost anything, but where his own family is alienated from his life, he seems to gain a new one in the form of Thao and his family.",10,0,2,11 January 2009
Into the Wild," luddite fetishization of a coddled man in way over his head
","I found something utterly fascinating in the true story of Christopher McCandless, venturing out into the 'wild' of Alaska with basically nothing but a gun and some food, and eventually succumbing to the inevitable.
I passed no judgment on him or his decisions when I read through the story, focusing more on the mystery of what drove him to a vagabond existence culminating in total hermitage from which he absolutely could not survive. The cliché of 'the devil is in the details' is one horribly true here, and tends to tear apart the story.
In truth, McCandless essentially committed suicide. He refused all the necessary help to survive in the cold, did not even learn how to dry meat, and, had he had a map, could have easily walked back to civilization at almost any point in time.
In fact, we can learn almost nothing from McCandless or his time spent in the wild, as his journal entries are as mindless and empty and almost completely devoid of any real content. They literally amount to things like 'Day 2: Fall through the ice day.' 'Day 4: Magic bus day.' 'Day 9: Weakness.' 'Day 10: Snowed in.' 'Day 68: Beaver Dam. Disaster.' 'Day 107 (the last entry): Beautiful berries'
Going into the actual film itself, we get virtually none of this. Instead we are taken on a tediously long, droning journey that covers almost none of the survival aspects and just covers his wandering through the US in the years leading up to the event.
Throughout this 'journey' we're treated to overly dramatic musical montages waxing poetic on how 'society, man, society is just society, man' ranting and railing with all the emptiness and incoherence of someone with basic understanding of almost everything, but knowledge of almost nothing.Life sure does sucks for a rich white kid who graduates from a prestigious university with nearly all A's, the movie tells us. How can you be happy with things like money and a job instead of living in the woods, hanging out with psychotically upbeat Danish tourists you meet after barely surviving a dangerous river paddling you jump in with 0 paddling experience, ignoring the guy who tells you you need to sign on with a professional because you could die. What does he know? Society, man. Screw society, man.
The truth about the abuse he and his sister suffered from their parents wasn't revealed publicly by the time his movie was made (though she did disclose it off the record to the book author Jon Krakauer), so it's never made fully explicit here. But the whole theme of the movie is such that it doesn't matter, because it doesn't easily fit into the theme that 'society sucks and you can only be happy living in the woods'.
The immense scale of the romanticization is insufferable. It becomes painfully pretentious almost immediately and it makes the protagonist thoroughly unlikeable; a vapid, empty vessel literally living the dream of the vapid spoiled white kid who worships nature and thinks modern society is a drag. The least I can say about this fictional version of McCandless is he is at least completely devoid of the self-righteous spite and meanness of a character like Holden Caulfield. He's not rubbing our faces in this pretentious message; the film itself is, and sometimes it seems as if he's just as much a victim as we are, having his adventure luridly fetishized as if he were an idol, and not someone who was way in over their head.
I can't help but think of a similar story of someone who died in the Alaska wilderness, Carl McCunn in 1981. He went with almost 2 tons of food and supplies, multiple weapons, and actually left highly detailed journal entries telling a tragic story of a man who made a rather different mistake; He did not make it clear to the pilot who left him in the wilderness to return for him 5 months later. As 5 months slips into 6 months, you can clearly feel the pain in his entries as he realizes he is likely never coming back alive, and no one is likely to come looking for him. At one point, he is even spotted by a state trooper flying over in a plane, but laments in his journal that he apparently accidentally signaled to the trooper that he was okay and not in need of rescue. His final entry is a plea to God to forgive him and look over his family, then writing 'They say it doesn't hurt' before taking his own life rather than freeze to death.
There's nothing remotely like that in this film. The film barely lingers on Chris's experience of solitude in the wild, preferring to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his silly adventures, interspersed with upbeat montage after montage set to popular music",1,16,23,18 November 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Epic
","There is no other word for it. Any amount of hyperbole would simply be insulting. Hyperbole is what things like this are made for.The film is a feat of visual effects that even in this day is frightening and spellbinding in how REAL it looks. Even the best CGI today can make something appear real, but it will ALWAYS just be on the very finest edge of artificiality. Virtually no part of this film ever slid through that edge. Every part appeared insanely real.The prelude, 'Dawn of Man' is itself a little film that brought me to tears with how amazingly, artfully done it is.The sequence in which Heywood Floyd and the rest gaze upon the Monolith on the moon was one that kept me frozen stiff in fear and wonder like no other work of art has ever done.Every single word spoken by HAL9000, coated in the thickest layers of smooth, deadpan articulation, is a horror of might and machine, and HAL's end is more heartwrenching and gutwrenching than most other movie death's for human characters.The entire 'postlude', Jupiter and beyond the infinite, was an all-out display of technology and wordless storytelling that seems at first to step into the realm of the 'pretentious artsy indy film made by an arrogant art student', and then destroys any inclinations towards that notion, and becomes the very avatar that those pretentious art students aim to recreate with their seeming randomness of images and ideas.I was in tears for so many portions of the film. Not from joy, not from sorrow, but from the sheer emotional power the film had that I have never seen from any film, book, play, television show, or game ever. Epic.",10,1,3,20 January 2010
Avatar," We've seen this movie before
","If this was the movie James Cameron has wanted to do since he was a teen, then maybe he should have taken better notes, or should have taken a very sharp editor's eye to his script.Because while this film is indeed pretty and a spellbinding achievement in the most stunningly realistic CG of any movie today, the plot is almost insulting in how stale, cliché'd, and just plain boring, ordinary, and generic it is. There's no surprises to be had; you know exactly who's going to win and who's going to lose, you know exactly how different action (not just fight) sequences will turn out, you know exactly what characters will live and which will die, which ones will have an abrupt Heel-Face turn, and which ones will turn out to be good all along.The only thing that will be memorable of this movie is its visual effects.Right from the start, the film does wonders with visual effects, showing us a highly realistic-looking sleeper ship, and a zero-g environment on board, that neither looks overly cartoony or overly CG'd.Cameron does not overindulge us by making us look at everything in detail, but neither does he rush through details in an attempt to stay grounded to the script. It's a perfect mix of showing us nifty creatures and inventions without stalling long enough to make us think he's showing off.The Na'vi start off looking quite real, but very blatantly CG. There's a slight sense of artificiality in the Avatars when they are first on screen, and shown awakening and interacting with humans. But as the movie progresses, the effects seem to get better and better, to a point where towards the end, when Na'vi and Humans interact, both of them look incredibly REAL, as though the Na'vi were a huge puppet, and yet it's entirely CG.Where they went all-out with the visuals, they completely lost it with the story. It becomes less 'Avatar' and more 'Dances With Wolves In Space'.But the story doesn't treat this as a surprise. Nor does it even try to be distinct. You know exactly how characters are going to react to situations. You know exactly what's going to happen next. You know that the Generic Nerd Sidekick appears jealous and resentful of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) now, but you know later on he's going to become the HERO who tries to save him. You know that Sully is going to be initially hated by Action Girl Love Interest (Zoe Saldana), but eventually get her to love him, You know that Bad Ass Action Girl (Michelle Rodriguez) is going to betray the humans and side with Sully and the Na'vi. You know which characters are going to die. You know that Sully will earn the trust and respect of the tribe. You know that Sully is going to admit he's been spying on the Na'vi, and cause Action Girl Love Interest to cry and scream and hate him and tell him to go away, You know this and that and everything.It's all so obvious that it becomes stupefyingly boring, and you wouldn't have ever noticed that fact if the movie weren't so much fun to look at.But while the effects and even much of the story was interesting enough to keep me drawn in, the most spectacular visual effect focus was on the Na'vi themselves... and the Na'vi themselves, as a society, were a breakneck yank out of immersion, and into a silly realization: 'They are exact alien copies of Native Americans!' They are exact copies, from the mohawks, to the way the Elder Father and Mother characters look and sound, to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle, they are EXACT COPIES of Native Americans.It would seem to me that this element was lazily left in from the ripping off of the plot of 'Dances With Wolves', and that would probably be a great discussion point, but like a great many modern 'PC' portrayals of Native Americans, they sugarcoat them so much, they become just as racist as the Savage Red Man (Blue Man?) portrayed in older stories.These Na'vi Americans are so in touch with their environment, they can talk to animals by sticking tentacles in their hair into plugs coming out of the animals' heads.They can wrap these tentacles around long tendrils from the 'Tree of Souls' to pray directly to their God. They have to cry and chant a ritual chant every time they kill an animal. They use bow and arrows, ride on animals, and make yipping sounds like the Natives in old 'cowboy and Indian' movies.It wouldn't be so bad, and it never really ventures into a racist depiction (especially since most of all these are ALIENS and not Native Americans), but the parallels are too strong to ignore---this is not even a metaphor or parody, these Na'vi are nearly word-for-word copies of stereotypical Native Americans.But since these AREN'T Native Americans and they ARE aliens, James Cameron can get away with essentially portraying them as the stereotype of the 'in perfect harmony and touch with mother nature' good guys, whereas the Humans, with the exception of only the obvious ones and the Nerdy Pacifist Scientists, are all evil, greedy scum who can't do anything with a planet except rape it and kill it slowly for resources, as though environmentalism efforts today would never ever work out or catch on. THANKS FOR THE FAITH, CAMERON! It's a stereotypical 'White Men vs Indians' tale of the 90s, with the evil Humans being thwarted by the holy Na'vi.And yet we get the Unfortunate Implication that the Na'vi apparently could not have survived or banded together without the leadership of Jake Sully, White Man Sky Person.THANKS FOR THE SUBTLE RACISM, JAMES CAMERON!",1,16,40,20 December 2009
Inside Man," Kind of grows on you
","It was kind of hard for me to like and appreciate this movie to begin with. I wasn't impressed by the previews and I was dragged to see this movie. After it was over, I thought it was a bit... like, not all there, kind of boring.After some weeks passed, with a few moments of reflecting on the movie, I realize it was a pretty good movie.Problems first: The only big problem I had with it was the 'Crash'-style blatant, pretentious racism, out to shock the audience.The rest of the movie was entertaining, and the 'bad guys''s plot was very clever. It had lots of very funny, slightly mean jokes in it and a lot of situations which make you laugh because it's a 'duh!' situation. Or something. I'm crazy.I purposely use 'quotes' around the term bad guys (referring to the 'bank robbers') because they really aren't bad, or out to hurt anyone or anything. Their plot was absolutely ingenious and would actually work in real life---but without monetary gain.Spoiler alert!: Their plot was really complex and very well done: They (Clive Owen's character and the gang) enter the bank disguised as painters, their faces hidden, use a high-tech device disguised as a flashlight to shut down the security cameras, then hold the bank hostage. They take all the hostages down to the bank vaults, have everyone dress in identical blue outfits with white ski-mask cloth things (you see in the previews) covering their faces and sunglasses over their eyes. The 'bank robbers' then dress the same way. The people are divided and put into various little offices, and told to sit down and shut up. They're all whimpering and sobbing and such, and at random intervals, the 'bank robbers' come in, take a few people out, and put them in another room, and switch people around. What they're also doing, is pretending to be one of the hostages, putting each other into the rooms at random intervals and whimpering and making noise like everyone else. That way, everyone thinks the 'bank robbers' infiltrating them are innocent people. The 'bank robbers' make outrageous demands to the police and make it very hard on them by demanding things and being very inflexible and uncooperative. At random moments, they push out one hostage for the police to apprehend, and because they are dressed just like the robbers, ALL the hostages are suspect! At the very end, after finding what they were looking for, the 'bank robbers' let everyone out the front door--and include themselves in the bunch (their guns were fake) and manage to escape scot-free because ALL the hostages are suspects, and all of them recognize each other as being among the hostages (since the 'bad guys' mixed themselves in among the hostages) so EVERYONE is let go and the bank robbers are never found---they also take nothing from the bank, no money, no files, nothing. What they DID do, however, because they would recognize Clive Owen's character's voice, he stayed behind in the bank, hidden behind the wall in the storage closet, where he came out after the whole ordeal, took some diamonds hidden in the bank, and documents telling about the bank owner's (Christopher Plummer) dealings during World War II with the Nazis and the diamonds were diamonds he stole from Jewish families during the holocaust, and kept hidden away because he was overwrought with guilt, and wanted to keep it hidden away forever (and he hired Jodi Foster's character to get involved with the police and make sure they found out nothing about this. The police never see the file, so the 'bank robbers' get away with it) That was long, and probably unnecessary, but that's the movie's surprise twist ending and content involving the bank robbers. I'm too tired now to explain everything else. I'm too much into spoilers.",10,2,4,3 May 2006
The Departed," It was very good, but the ending left me unfulfilled
","Coming in to 'The Departed', I was lucky to already know what the plot was about (some trailers are so obscure as to not mention jack-crap about the plot, to hide the fact that it sucks) and it got four stars (highest rating) in my local newspaper's movie reviews, with lots of great mention on acting and drama and directing.The movie was very well-done. It was a bit confusing in the start as some of the actors mumbled and made it hard to understand them, but this didn't deter from the plot as though you missed something important. The directing style wasn't too special at first, but showed some definite high points and strengths later on (the scene where Martin Sheen's character, chief Queenan, is thrown from the roof of a building in slow motion, a bunch of people in the theater I was in gasped audibly, and even more so when he hit the ground)The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, not just in the movie, but in their roles as rats, were very convincing (some scenes with DiCaprio, and Frank Costello suspecting him as the rat, made me genuinely think he wasn't a rat, but rather pretending to be one.)The dialog is crisp and never seems to falter with uselessness or insanity or something off the wall completely. My only complaints were that Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan had some unexplained obsession with the golden dome roof of a church, in which he'd constantly stare at in his apartment. This was never explained or even delved into in the least. Another was the mild hint at Costello slowly going crazy over the course of the movie. I didn't see this at all. He did some eccentric things in the later course, but nothing to truly qualify as ascending derangement.The movie peaked when the two rats discovered each other out (after Costello's death) and DiCaprio's character William Costigan went out trying to expose him, even going so far as to lure him into a trap and trying to arrest him, despite not being a cop (his identity was erased for secrecy reasons during his mission, which only the police chief who was killed knew, and the Sergeant played by Mark Wahlberg, Seargent Dignam, who left the police force rather than hand over the identity of their rat in Costello's group).It all seemed to go downhill from here as Billy Costigan is killed by an officer who was revealed to be a second rat working for Costello, who then let Sullivan go. He then killed one of the officers who was friends with DiCaprio's character, and then was killed by Sullivan. Then he went home, to discover Dignam there, who then killed him and wandered off.The final scene is that of Sullivan's balcony, with a view of the golden dome church, and a rat on the banister sniffing something. For some reason, this ending left me unfulfilled, and a bit disappointing, almost anti-climactic for a movie which was building up so much intensity, complexity, and drama.",1,4,10,8 October 2006
There Will Be Blood," I. Drink. Your. MILKSHAKE!
","This movie solidifies Daniel Day-Lewis as the breakout actor of this decade. Always selective in his roles, he does the character of Daniel Plainview with such brilliant intensity, humor, love, hate, and subtlety that you never realize his character is changing as the movie progresses.The story is not at all highly dramatic and complex, following the simple story of Plainview's attempt to get at the vast ocean of oil beneath a small western village. The movie is primarily a character study, as Daniel takes up perhaps 90% of the movie.Paul Dano, as Eli Sunday, plays opposite Daniel not too often, but in such a social duel with one another that doesn't overwhelm or underwhelm. And you begin to notice throughout the movie that Eli becomes more and more like Daniel as the story progresses.The movie's focus on Daniel is done in such a way that the movie is about him, but not in a megalomaniacal way that he must be on screen at all times. Other characters shine around him, and play off of him to make their own characters that much more interesting.The break-out acting by Daniel Day-Lewis peaks by the end, in which all subtlety is abandoned in a closing scene bound to be a Hollywood classic. Maybe in the future, alongside the likes of 'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn' or 'Stella!', will be a most memorable movie line, 'I. DRINK. YOUR. MILKSHAKE!!!!!! I DRINK IT UP!!!'",10,5,12,21 January 2008
Hancock," lolwut?
","...was the reaction I had by the time I finished watching the movie. As much as I have a distaste for using stupid internet acronyms seriously, that's quite literally how I felt.The movie had an interesting premise, in a superhero who is a moody, drinking misanthrope with a particular twitch-spot for being called an asshole.Very early on Hancock's path crosses with That Guy (Jason Bateman's character, the PR guy, whose name is completely forgettable) and they start trying to change him. Maybe 20 minutes into the movie or less, Hancock goes to prison to show people he won't flaunt the law, and to have people clamoring to have him back when crime skyrockets.The majority of the movie's fun happens within the first half, with scenes covered in the trailer (such as tossing a beached whale onto a sailboat) and some new ones not seen in the trailer (Hancock half-naked, his clothes having been burnt off from putting out a fire, cutting in front of kids in front of an ice cream truck and snatching some ice cream for himself), but these are all covered mostly in YouTube spots while That Guy shows Hancock how people don't like him.After he's changed to be more decent, it gets touchy and warm and Hancock is a good guy after all.Then comes the part that had been built up without subtlety... and spoilers follow.It was rather overt that Mary (Charlize Theron) was going to be involved with Hancock, especially when the director goes out of his way to show her face in a closeup whenever he appears near her for several seconds longer than normal. Then comes a post-party scene, in which he basically corners her in a kitchen and tries to kiss her. Then she throws him into the refrigerator and send both crashing out into the street.Oh ya, that's right. She's a superhero thing, too.Then starts the whole 'lolwut?' moment of the film,, as they try to have her trying to explain to Hancock, her husband, and all of us the whole deal, and fails quite miserably. The story she tells is some mess of them being some sort of godly creatures that were created by GOD (though it is PC never mentioned) in pairs, and that they've lived for like as long as the Bible says earth has existed.. a few thousand years.Quite frankly, that's only my best-guess summarization of the mess of words thrown at us to see what would stick---in the end, it doesn't even matter what they are, as the point they drive home with brutal redundancy is that if the two of them are close by each other, they both lose their powers and become mortal, which is why Hancock lost his memory, because every time they get too close to each other in history, something bad happens and they have to depart, until one time in the late 20s when Hancock got amnesia (and a story of how he tried to sign out from the hospital, not knowing who he was, and a nurse asked him for his 'John Hancock', as in signature).The story doesn't seem to change, but they repeat it so many times in so many different ways that it throws people off, as they start thinking 'wait, they're destined to be together', then 'wait, they can't be together or they both become mortal and die', then 'wait, they were built together by nameless-god', then 'wait, they weren't meant to be together', then 'wait, they're bound by fate to always be together' and so on and so on until you really don't care anymore and you just want someone to die just to change the pace.The entirety of the movie's second-half plot no longer deals with any typical 'good guy vs bad guy' or 'hero must overcome' archetype, as a band of baddies escaping from jail try to kill Hancock become so unimportant that even Hancock doesn't spare a second glance at the TV when their breakout is announced on the news.The entire focus is around explaining, then re-explaining, then convoluting the entire concept behind these two 'godly' beings to a point where their explanations run into gaping plot-holes, the biggest one being: If Hancock's been living in LA long enough to become a household name, and staying in their house around her for several weeks before finding her out, why didn't he or Mary lose any of their powers being in the same city? Considering how she not only tells him to not see her family ever again, but to leave the entire city, and how Hancock starts losing his powers when he is very far away from her, it's completely nonsensical that he only starts to lose his powers AFTER she mentions it.The ending is also nonsensical, as Hancock had earlier in the movie ended up losing his powers when he is shot in a liquor-store hold-up, who knows how far away from Mary's house, and when he and Mary are in the hospital, he starts immediately regaining his powers when he exits the hospital and starts putting a few meters' distance between them.Ultimately, the entire second half of the movie resembled a nonsensical mess of a plot-hole big enough to fit the moon through and a complete lack of actual plot to drive the story other than Hancock's whole 'should I leave the city so I can be a superhero or should I stay for... some reason never explained in the movie' Because the movie never really does explain why he should/would stay in LA after learning all this... it's not like he fell in love with Mary after his amnesia, and despite all of this revelation, Mary stays married to That Guy and Hancock leaves anyway for their own good. So what the hell?",3,32,52,7 July 2008
Centurion," Run of the mill action flick
","Everything in this film is unbelievably predictable, stale, by-the-numbers, and obvious. You know right away that the minorities will die first; the Numidian (black guy), the Assyrian (arab guy), the Greek (arab-looking guy), etcetera. There's the standard archetypes, as opposed to characters; the grizzled old soldier, the straight sidekick, the noble superhuman leader who just knows everything on how to survive, including fluent Gaelic, even the token fist-fight with weapon just out of reach and bad guy and good guy racing to get the weapon in time.I don't particularly mind the use of British accents, not just standard British, but the 'lower' class type, Cockney, Liverpudilan, Scottish, Irish, etcetera to represent a wide variety of accents that such a mixed Roman Imperial army would have, but it becomes highly disorienting and rips you out of the immersion when they don't just speak with the accents, but use heavily British mannerisms in their speech.There's virtually little to the characters to make them in any way compelling or likable. In particular, the General is said to be so great, like a father, brother, and even god to his men, yet this is never displayed. It's what TVTropes calls an 'Implied Attribute', when a character is said to be in a certain way, yet it's never displayed on screen.The sole token battle scene inspired promise initially, as they show a very well-executed display of Roman discipline, as they quickly got into Schiltron formation, making circles with their shields and spears pointed outward, but once the battle actually unfolded, it devolved to generic Hollywood 'one-man-army' type fighting, with the shields suddenly gone and the swords being used to block axes, and loads of gratuitous gore that at the very least isn't pointless, but is used to such excess that you start to easily spot CG gore, particularly when the blood is just TOO solid in tone---with no variations in color tone based on lighting or shadow.The rest of the story is just the band of archetypes on the run from Etain, a Brigante who betrays the Romans in such a clear and obvious way, who hunts them viciously until a fight where just three of them survive.There's even a token romantic subplot which is not only painfully devoid of chemistry, but completely and utterly pointless, without any relevance to the plot, likely just to inflate the run-time by 10 or 15 minutes (the movie is only 1 hour and 30 minutes).There's not much of interest in this movie. It's typical in being problematic with historical accuracy, has some action, but hardly anything remarkable or not seen in other movies, and done better.It's the sort of film you'd watch on TV once, maybe while doing something else.",2,12,26,13 November 2010
Munich," A second viewing later and I've fallen in love with the characters and story
","I first saw the movie when it came out in theaters in December 2005, and was ultimately forgotten by me, until I decided to buy it on DVD two and a half years later and watched it again. And I found that the movie was highly enjoyable, entertaining, and something that I could easily watch again and again just for the character interaction.Sometimes it seems ridiculous to base politics and beliefs off what is seen in movies, but this wouldn't be the first time it's happened to me; before seeing the movie, I saw Israel as the wrong party in the Middle East, having stolen Palestinian land, and then leeching US assistance in oppressing Palestinians just because they lived in Israel 2,000 years ago. After this movie, I can't see either side as bad. It's a conflict beyond black and white whose basest participants are nowhere near anything resembling Stalinist or Hitleresque evil people they are made out to be by their enemies via propaganda or extremist ideology.The opening sequence of the movie is done in amazing fashion that makes you feel as though you are watching the news and hearing about the events unfold in real time with your supportive Muslim family and your tense, frozen-stiff with terror Jewish family, while you also get very beautifully shot and gory scenes of the Black September terrorists breaking into the Israeli athletes' hotel room in Munich, where the fighting and conflict is so well-directed, you feel as if you were one of the Israelis, and that if you just stayed quiet and followed orders, you would make it out alive.What ultimately happens is already well-known, but still hits painfully, and with the simultaneous reading of the Israeli names of the victims on the news with the Palestinian names of those who planned the botched kidnapping listed off by Mossad high command.Every character that is come across in the film is interesting, and has innate chemistry with whomever else they're talking to. Eric Bana as Avner is perfect in the role, being highly sympathetic even as he is indeed a terrorist. Ciaran Hinds as Carl plays the father-like figure to Avner and the rest of the group, like a rock holding the makeshift family together. Daniel Craig as Steve is the quintessential hothead who seems the be the prototypical terrorist in that he is driven purely by hatred for the Palestinians, yet is still well-rounded in that he is a believable, likable person, without any characteristics that seem wildly out of character for him. Matheiu Kassovitz as Robert is the makeshift bomb-maker, who manages some minor humor that is in no way out of place or inappropriate.Even their enemies in the conflict are keenly humanized without being overly apologetic, from Abdel Wael Zwaiter in Rome, who is clumsily killed while trying to talk and reason with a highly nervous and tense duo of Avner and Robert, Hussein Al Bashir's brief conversation with Avner in the Cyprus hotel balcony before the bomb under his bed blows him up, and nearly kills Avner and two civilians in the process, to Louis's intentionally bunking the four Mossad agents in an old apartment with a group of Palestinians at the same time, the two groups forced to keep their identities and intentions a secret or else risk exposing their plans to the enemy.This sequence also has some lighter, and yet in the broader context most deeply disturbing, moments, such as Steve and a Palestinian silently fighting over what music to play on the radio, before mutually settling on an American station (I forgot what type of music), and Avner arguing Arab/Israeli politics with the Palestinian group's leader, with the Palestinian's conclusion that the reason to fight the Israelis over Palestine is that a home is more important than anything else.Like with most any movie involving a makeshift 'family' between comrades, there's always the series of events that leads to its dissolution, and for viewers like me, a sense of that time being the best time of their lives, and the (survivors') lives afterwords being bleak and emptier without the comradery. Indeed, even Spielberg said of the character of Avner 'I don't think he'll ever find peace'.For the negatives, I think the biggest down-point of the movie would be the poorly-explained, completely fictional and unimportant French connection involving 'Louis' and his whole amoral spy network of secret information and connections that seemingly works everywhere with everyone from terrorists to first world countries, in a sort of 'Quantam' ('Quantam of Solace') sort of 'apathetic godly overseer' type role. While at the very least the conversations had with Avner and the old man (forgot his name) at the head of the family, I didn't find it to be all that necessary, and would have spoken more for Mossad's intelligence capabilities if the information on their targets had come from Mossad instead of from an unnamed, barely known, seemingly unstructured independent French organization with eyes all over the world and no real desire to do anything with it but sell information to the highest bidder.While there are flaws, it's definitely a movie both tragic and enrapturing, grittily shot and realistically depicted, with intense chemistry between virtually everyone involved that makes it worth multiple viewings and owning.",10,1,1,30 December 2008
300," 'That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks'
","From a visual perspective, 300 is something of a masterpiece. But movies aren't supposed to be visual masterpieces---they're supposed to have decent dialogue, story, and substance to back it up. That is what separates good movies from bad ones that look good.I've had my months leading up to the movie and afterwards of trashing this movie for not only its historical inaccuracies, but it's ridiculous treatment of basic logic. Nowhere else can you see 300 naked men bellow at two massive elephants and send them toppling off a cliff, or a single naked man kill a charging rhino with little more than a flimsy wooden spear.Everything in 300 save for a scene with horses was filmed in a warehouse against green or bluescreen, and while it makes for some visual spectacles, it removes a certain grittiness from it that fails to capture the audience and thrust them right in the midst of the action.Another major failing is the Spartans themselves. The key to any superhero comic movie (because these Spartans can't be human) is for the hero to be endearing to the audience. The director appears to have completely fumbled this, by making the main characters incredibly arrogant, intolerant, and smug, while giving them anachronistic ideals of freedom and liberty (like a Roman Emperor preaching equality for all men) which rather than preach, they bellow at one another.Rarely does Leonidas say anything that isn't shrieked in the most bellicose manner possible. His lines range in depth and complexity from 'SPARTAAAAANS! PUSH!' 'SPARTAAAAAANS!! PREPARE FOR GLOOOORY!!' 'SPARTAAAANS! WE WILL STAND AND FIGHT!!!' By failing to endear, and arrogance, I refer to several scenes, including when Leonidas first meets Ephialtes. In history, Ephialtes was a normal goat herder or farmer, who betrayed the Greeks by revealing to Xerxes a goat path leading around the pass out of greed. In the movie, he's a horribly deformed monster (akin to a mix of Gollum from LOTR and Joe Merrick, the Elephant Man), with a heart of gold, seeking to prove himself in battle. His effort to hoist a shield and thrust a spear is almost heartwarming in its attempts, yet Leonidas haughtily says that since he can't raise his shield high enough for long enough, he can't fight in a phalanx (which is particularly ironic, since the Spartans never fight in a phalanx in the entire movie save for the first battle---the director Zack Snyder even admitted doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't 'cool enough' for his movie), thrusting Ephialtes into a grief-ridden rage which causes him to betray the Spartans rather than help them.Leonidas also very arrogantly mocks his Phokian allies for not being born to kill like the Spartans are.A lot of movie cross-over appears to happen, as Ephialtes very much resembles Gollum in Lord of the Rings, so too the Persian Immortals must have been dug up in Isengard, like the Uruk-hai in LOTR---they are not human, and look very much like Orcs. And the 'Uber Immortal' as it was so brilliantly labeled, was little more than a thinner, more muscular cave troll.Whatever humanity is left in the film is squandered for the more machismo audience. Queen Gorgo's role is little more than to look like a frumpy 50 year old housewife, muttering about some incomprehensible thing or other while another Spartan attempts to court her. Before Leonidas leaves, he treats the audience to a sex scene so dull and lifeless that it amounts to little more than a CG dry humping with Gorgo. The end of this subplot culminates in the Spartan who has been flirting with her getting stabbed in the public forum while gold coins fly in the air and everyone bellows 'TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR!!!!!'To the battle scenes: As mentioned above, Zack Snyder admitted to doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't 'cool'. So rather than attempt to give the audience something new, innovative, and unbelievably bloody and violent, he gives us the same old glorified one-man-army crap we've seen in a dozen action movies. CG or not, there's little innovation or anything to impress with the action scenes. Many times, you're left laughing or shaking your head in disbelief as the fighters go out of their way to look 'cool' rather than deadly. One case in particular is when a Persian Immortal has a clear shot at a Spartan, and chooses rather than to stab his naked chest, to drop his weapon and DROPKICK him.At some point, you get overwhelmed with the Spartans sticking Persians with their spears like hot knives through margarine, and giant waves of bodies keeling onto a wave of Immortals, and quite literally random slow-motion sequences showing off how close a hurled axe cuts Leonidas' helmet plume, or how many rope fibers are at the end of a Persian's whip, or how many beads of sweat drip down the bronzed and chiseled chest of a Spartan. Okay, we get it! You have a 100 million dollar budget to spend on CG and you don't know how to show it off! There's little else going for the movie other than nonstop and often senseless action violence which gets excessive, broken only by the lonely and useless subplot with Gorgo looking frumpy and Spartan #2 forcibly kissing her. Even if you were to look past the unbearably significant historical inaccuracies and the gaping holes in logic (like how 300 Spartans march off to battle without any supplies, no food or water or baggage train, with nothing but their capes, short-shorts, spears, helmets, and shields) it amounts to little more than an action yarn and a visual mess of action and sunset-colored landscape, little else from dialogue and script, acting, even sound, make it distinct in any sort of way. I doubt many people in years to come would remember this as any more than 'That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks'",1,27,45,1 July 2007
The Godfather," Long and laborious, and so very cold and pointless... how is this a classic?
","I'm a modern type of movie viewer, but I can appreciate classics, like 'Annie Hall', 'Midnight Cowboy', 'Forrest Gump', 'Casablanca', etc. I simply do not understand what people see in 'The Godfather' To start with, I'm not really into the whole crime mob Italian Sicilian Naples mafiosi family thing, so it didn't have my attention at that. The acting was good, but Marlon Brando was annoying--his weirdy voice is infamous, but I couldn't understand anything he said! It sounded very flaccid and emotionless, too.The story itself seemed very pointless... Michael Corleone kills a bunch of people, mob hits, his father gets shot or something, he becomes the new Godfather or something. Nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved. Didn't serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing. With thick accents.The mood was also very very cold-hearted. There's a general complaint about Steven Spielberg's 'Munich' that it's very cold, too, that the characters don't have a warmth to them that you can identify with. 'The Godfather' characters are like this too. You can't identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold, not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them, except maybe Marlon Brando, who seemed like a crazy old grandpa who's half-senile.I can't see the classic status of this movie. If it were released today, would it receive the same praise?",1,16,65,14 May 2006
