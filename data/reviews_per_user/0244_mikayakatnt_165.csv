The Rock," The age when Michael Bay was good
",A treasure from the explosion of action movie pulp fictions from the 90s. That's all that needs to be said about this movie. You will enjoy it and it'll keep you entertained for the couple of hours you're glued to your seat.4/5. Go watch it.,8,2,2,20 February 2020
The King's Speech," This film isn't for everyone.
",The King's Speech is about a reluctant king overcoming his speech impediment to help his country gain the courage to fight Nazi Germany.The King's Speech is a story behind an epic moment in time. Look closely and you will see that it's in the same spirit of those too-wild-to-be-true-but-still-true films like Wolf of Wall Street or War Dogs.Set pieces are true to its era and the musical score blends in with the scenes.It will be a bit slow in some parts. It could be a borefest for those seeking action.But its damn enjoyable and motivating. More motivating than those quotepics shared by my friends on Facebook.5/5. You may have to be a bit of an Anglophile to enjoy this movie.,10,1,1,5 March 2020
Blade Runner 2049," A Sequel That Deserves the Name
","A great homage to the original Blade Runner.Visual effects were gorgeous and loved how this movie expanded the universe. Gosling, Ford, and Leto played their parts fantastically well.Especially loved the color palettes of the entire film.Though, at certain parts it felt like Ford was being dragged around the story for the sake of fanboys. His part could have far better. Regardless, the ending was still beautiful.4/5.",8,2,12,6 November 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A great conclusion to the story
","An amazing ending to the first film.Normally I'm skeptical of sequels but this one delivered on my expectations and then some. Tarantino's world-building and storytelling are showcased in this film as powerfully as the first film. The style of this film is distinct from the first one and provides a breathtaking view of the Kill Bill universe.4.5/5. Over-the-top, satisfying, and bloody brilliant.",9,0,0,18 May 2020
Requiem for a Dream," A good trip gone bad...then worse
","Christ, this movie makes me never want to even get close to drugs.This movie does a better job of scaring people away from drugs than any other PSA or DARE program ever could do.'I'm going to be a star, Harry!'5/5, now I'm going to need to call my mom before I break down.",10,3,4,3 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Snoozefest! Worst of the prequels
",I fell asleep on this movie as a kid and revisiting it I am reminded why.This movie is too slow and there were too many George Lucas-style cash grabs that unsettled me. Most of the movie seems to have been wanting to sell me cheap merchandise than tell an actual story. Least the pod racing video game was fun.But George Lucas really did a number on his original creation. What's up with the Gungans? Why the pod racing scene? Midichlorians?Not to mention the boring Jedi council scenes and the really confusing ending sequence. The movie tried to achieve too many things at once..5/5. RIP Darth Maul.,1,1,3,20 February 2020
The Equalizer," Rewatch rewatch rewatch
","I hate that I don't hate this movie.Something about Denzel Washington and justiceporn that gets me coming back and back to this film. Especially when I see it playing on cable while at home.The film is straightforward and takes no questions. Denzel Washington is some ex-CIA/super-soldier/superhuman/whatever that helps out good people and kills bad guys. Straightforward, right?Action scenes were damn enjoyable and the ending was epic. Who else could kill with a nailgun and look so badass?I was debating on giving this film a 3/5, but I've rewatched it so many times that I think it deserves an extra star.4/5.",8,0,1,5 March 2020
War Dogs," Good watch, not stellar but worthwhile
","Another one of those so-wild-but-true-story movies. War Dogs is mix of Wolf of Wall Street and Scarface sprinkled with comedy.Though War Dogs is lovable, it presents nothing new to the table. The film is more interested in keeping us entertained than informing us. The movie is a lot of guns and moneyporn. Jonah Hill does his part as the funny chubby guy.3.5/5. Above average and enjoyable but not worth a 4/5 or higher.",7,0,0,18 February 2020
It," Holy Cow...kept me on my feet!
","Christ, this was actually a pretty amazing horror movie. I was genuinely terrified. I still am.Normally I'm wary of sequels but this went above and beyond the mark.5/5 stars. Made it on my favorites list and I hate scary movies.",10,0,1,25 January 2020
Hereditary," REAL HORROR
","Holy. Cow.Hereditary is 2/3rds slow burn that comes crashing down in the final act.There were moments I wondered if I was still watching a scary movie. Yet, each little detail and seemingly useless line of dialogue holds a deeper meaning. The amount of foreshadowing in this film is insane. These deeper layers mean re-watchability time and time again... not that I would want to watch it again.The cinematography takes an interesting direction as well. Ari Aster shows innovation even with the first dollhouse to movie-start scene. Some of the scenes, transitions, and long shorts are spectacular and unnerving. The soundtrack, and sometimes lack of sound, adds to the terror. Slow, unnerving shots keep the audience on edge. And Ari Aster takes no reservation on disturbing visuals through the film. Expect a wild ride.Everyone's performance in this film is jaw dropping and believable. From Annie's (Toni Collette) slow breakdown, Peter's (Alex Wolff) teenage angst, and Charlie's (Milly Shapiro) awkward kid phase. There are many scenes worthy of Oscars in this film.Though, I had some misgivings about the plot. I found the delivery and originality worthy of praise. This is a film that stands out in the horror genre.5/5. Nothing short of perfection. What horror movies should be more like.",10,0,1,22 March 2020
Training Day," Classic Good Cop/Bad Cop Story
","Memorable, great film, and inspired lots of other movies/games. What more can you ask for?Some parts of the story did seem a bit outstretched. Yet, it didn't make me lose my suspension of reality. A classic.",8,2,3,4 November 2019
John Wick," Iconic Action Movie of the 2010's
","John Wick is a no-questions-asked action thriller that keeps the audience wanting more.Action-porn cannot begin to describe this movie. Lots of gunplay and dead unnamed Russian thugs. It's a fun watch for those who enjoy the genre.The storyline was a bit dull. Someone kills John Wick's dog and he goes out for revenge. The end. Some of the dialogue seemed forced or shallow.One area this film did do well in is how Keanu did all his own stunts. That's one reason why this film became iconic in its genre.3.5/5. Though the film was a fun watch, the shallowness of the story didn't make it memorable to me. A 4/5 on a good day.",7,0,2,13 January 2020
A Star Is Born," Great, heartwarming movie with a non-cliche storyline
",A beautiful love story that turns out a bit predictable and slow in some areas. Still liked it.Really enjoyed the music pieces. Especially enjoyed Lady Gaga's rendition of 'La Vie En Rose.'4/5. Get Gaga that Oscar.,8,0,0,18 February 2020
Erin Brockovich," Must Watch, Great Real-Life Story
","Everyone loves a David vs Goliath movie. Especially if it turns out that such a story is based on a true story.Erin Brockovich is a biographical film depicting the real-life story of the person the film is named after. The movie is full of tense moments, snappy comebacks, and a sense of elation at the ending. Julia Roberts does her part in bringing Erin Brockovich to life.4/5. Great film. Must-watch film for those interested in environmentalism & real-life David v Goliath stories.",8,0,0,9 December 2019
The Death of Stalin," Great Watch, Really Funny!
","Though historically inaccurate, I enjoyed this film more than I expected. Lots of clever humor seen from the British perception of the USSR.4/5. 1 star off for historical inaccuracies. Overall, great movie.",8,1,1,13 January 2020
Mulan," Powerful Woman POC Lead in an 90's Classic
","An early example of a Hollywood film that doesn't whitewash an Asian lead character.Mulan is a satisfying movie for its animation, action, and storytelling. Not to mention that Mulan inspired an entire generation of girls growing up in the 1990s.This film deserves its solidified spot in Disney's golden era of 1990s children movies.5/5. Unforgettable and rewatchable for years to come.",10,0,0,4 March 2020
Se7en," Se7en out of Ten
","A decent 90's thriller. Creative idea, production, and team. Though, I didn't find the film as memorable as some of the other 90's thrillers out there.3.5/5. Good for a rainy date night if you have nothing better to watch.",7,1,1,19 March 2020
Wayne's World," Aged badly, good for nostalgia
","Saw this on a plane. Helped me fall asleep.Wayne's World is an iconic movie for many moviegoers, but a lot of the jokes didn't make me laugh. Was I born in the wrong era or did the film not age well?2.5/5. A Comedy Central style movie that you'd see reruns of during the 2000s.",5,1,5,25 January 2020
Wayne's World," Iconic 90's Comedy
","Saw this on a plane. Helped me fall asleep.Wayne's World is an iconic movie for many moviegoers, but a lot of the jokes didn't make me laugh.

Fight Club," Intense from start to finish
","Fight Club takes no hesitation to question consumerism, masculinity, and finding one's place in society through the use of an unreliable narrator.4.5/5.",9,2,3,3 March 2020
Akira," One of the best animated films I've ever seen
","They don't make films like this anymore. There is a reason why the anime industry went into a crash shortly after this film was produced. Animation studios couldn't reach the bars set by this movie.Animation quality, sound design, and the storyline are groundbreaking. The use of light throughout the film is unique and presents it as its own protagonist.The fact that no one is a true villain or hero is another reason why I love this movie. Each character is flawed in the own way while also having some merits. Even the city of NeoTokyo itself has its own character.This film deserves its righteous place in one of the top anime films of all time.5/5. 10/10. 50/50. 100/100. Hands down.",10,3,4,18 February 2020
Train to Busan," Unique Zombie Thriller
",A heart-wretching zombie thriller that keeps you glued to your seat from the get-go.Presents a fresh breath to an already overbeaten zombie genre. Definitely a must-watch. Would recommend to friends.4.5/5. More zombie movies should be like this.,9,0,1,4 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A solid Star Wars spinoff movie
","There was literally one sentence in Episode IV that made this movie. Does everything in Star Wars need a backstory?All kidding aside, this was actually a pretty good side-story for the Star Wars universe. Diverged a bit from the usual characters and was enjoyable to watch even for new fans. Not too heavy on dialogue or boring politics.4/5.",8,1,3,3 March 2020
World War Z," *Spoilers & Plotholes
","Watching this movie for the first time, I was skeptical. I have trust issues with modern zombie movies as so many have let me down.Please note: I did not read the book.World War Z was surprisingly fun. The action was constant, fast, and a sense of suspense kept me watching.Plot was kind of silly but I guess you can't call it a 'World War' movie unless the protagonist moves around the world.My suspension of belief was broken a few times. Why did the military send the BEST HOPE they have on defeating the zombies on a suicide mission? Did they expect that he wouldn't die when everyone else in every city in the world was being killed? How did Israel build that wall so fast? Construction doesn't work that fast, especially for major projects like that. How come Brad Pitt sticks himself with a random vial of a fatal disease? There could be many strains of a single disease and he somehow picks the right one. He could have died and the movie be over.I digress.3/5. Half-good, half-bad. Hold your suspension of belief, you'll need it.",6,0,1,10 March 2020
Shaun of the Dead," The parody that eclipsed its predecessor
","This is one of the best parodies of a zombie movie I've ever seen. There is no wonder why this film surpassed the original both in success and memorability.With older comedy movies, I am sometimes worried with how bad jokes can age. Shaun of the Dead's humor is witty, thought-out, and still funny.The buildup of the plot is slow but that is by intentional design. The movie foreshadows the entire plot the clueless protagonists are bumbling around. This results in the audience being kept at real anticipation waiting for the big break.The movie has a satisfying beginning, middle, and end. All delivery and jokes don't taper off and we're all kept having fun throughout. Inside jokes and hints keep the film re-watchable time and time again.4.5/5. Amazing and must watch for fans of the genre. Nothing short of comedic genius.",9,1,2,10 March 2020
12 Angry Men," Courtroom Drama That's an Instant Classic
",An instant classic that everyone should watch. Very bare-bones but the drama holds the audience there. The plot moved logically and makes more sense than most movies that I see today.4.5/5.,9,0,1,4 November 2019
Happy Gilmore," Classic Adam Sandler
",Not sure why everyone gives this film so much hate. This was one of Adam Sandler's better movies.3.5/5.,7,0,0,19 March 2020
The Irishman," Snoozefest
","Even as a Scorsese fan, this film disappointed. As much as I wanted to love this film, I was simply disappointed by the end result.First, the good. The source material this film uses tells the real-life mystery surrounding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. It shares the unlikely, yet true, story of Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran and his involvement in the Philadelphia mafia. This epic of a movie covers ~30-50 years and a large cast of interesting characters. All could have movies made about their own lives that would be as interesting.The cinematography and choice of music is AAA+. I'd like to give Rodrigo Prieto special attention to the work that he did in this film. The plot is compelling and worthwhile.But the flaws quickly come up. I found Scorsese's choice of actors unfitting for the story told. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci are all well distinguished actors in their own regards. Yet, their age and cliched acting overpowered the positives that they offered. There was no single point in the film that I was convinced of Robert De Niro or Al Pacino were men in their 30s/40s. No amount of CGI de-aging could hide that fact.Seeing men in their 70s acts in a 3 hour film can make this a snoozefest for some of its viewers. That can be seen in the Netflix numbers showing the small number of viewers that actually make it to the end.As many critics pointed out, I felt as if the long and winding story could have been told in a more concise manner. Action and scenes of significance happen far and few. Time is taken to build the world that Frank Sheeran existed in rather than moving the story. But some people will see that more as a pro than a con.As mentioned earlier, I wanted to love this film. Yet, it fails to have the same cinematic magic that Scorsese has shown in his other work. The film disappears in the viewers mind as soon as they finish it, if not sooner. The film leaves no lasting impact on its viewers and will be overshadowed by Scorsese's earlier work.2/10. One star for plot, one for cinematography. It really took Scorsese 10+ years to make this film?",2,6,14,10 December 2019
Creed," Unnecessary Cash Grab
","I hate unneeded sequels. Creed comes off as a cash grab riding on the success of the Rocky series.The original Rocky formula is there, but it doesn't come off as believable. Why would a retired boxer now try to train some random guy who walks into his restaurant? Is Rocky going to do this for everyone that guilt trips him? A good boxer does not equate into a good coach. Not to mention that just because someone's dad is a good boxer doesn't mean that their offspring will be as well.Even if we fix the suspension of belief, the movie moves too slow to be enjoyable. Creed has lots of drama interspersed between training montages and fight scenes. The time it takes to get to action is long and full of awkward dialogue. Once we get to the fights, they're short and end too fast. Lots more to be desired from a boxing movie.Do love the actors in this movie though. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone do what they can with a cash-grab movie.2.5/5. I tried to love this but I can't. The movie is too much of a drag for me to enjoy.",5,1,3,10 March 2020
Dead Poets Society," PERFECTION; RIP ROBIN WILLIAMS
","A timeless classic that every high school English teacher will make you watch. Revisiting this film really makes me miss Robin Williams.Great character development, a bit slow, but a classic that can't be forgotten.5/5. RIP Robin Williams.",10,0,1,6 November 2019
About Time," B.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L.
","Normally I'm wary of romcoms. But this movie genuinely surprised me.About Time is a rom-com that asks the simple question 'if you had the ability to time travel, what would you do?' This simple premise is given with no complex explanation and the rest of the story follows.The movie starts off a bit cheesy and predictable but goes through a series of twists and turns.There's a ton of real heartfelt moments that the main character, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) shares with every major character of the film. Domhnall Gleeson also does a convincing role as the awkward English boy a bit too well. Bill Nighy does an above-and-beyond performance as a Dad and the father-son chemistry with Domhnall feels genuine.Themes covered in this film showcase the value of relationships in one's life and how major decisions can shift the direction of one's life.The film is about two hours but it feels much longer than that, in a good way. This film is sentimental and beautiful. I normally don't do sentimental films, but this film had me feeling some type of way.4.5/5. Be warned, you may find yourself hiding in your closet, clenching your first, trying to go back in time. It's definitely worth a watch with a loved one.",9,0,0,22 March 2020

Deadpool 2," Not as Good as First
","I'd say it's good but not as good as the first one. Yet, the plot introduces new characters in new ways and doesn't cling too closely to cliches. Found the self-humor enjoyable.3/5. Average.",6,1,2,4 November 2019
Zodiac," Generic based-on-true-life horror
","Looks nothing like Ted Cruz.Kidding. In all seriousness, Zodiac is a 2007 horror film that focuses on the real-life story of the Zodiac killings. The plot is slow, payoff takes too long, and the story is predictable. Nothing makes this film stand out besides the story it tells.3/5. Average.",6,1,3,5 March 2020
Cloverfield," What This Genre Should Be About
","A low-budget found-footage shakey-cam film that does the genre justice.Enjoyed the edge-of-your-seat style horror, the hidden monster, and genuine terror that the main characters showed throughout the film.Still, found some of the characters annoying. But life gives us those types of people sometimes.This is one of those few films you can watch multiple times and enjoy every bit of it.4.5/5. Not too sure how to feel about the ending.",9,6,7,18 February 2020
The Hateful Eight," Wasn't my fav Tarantino film...
","All the things that make Tarantino's films good drug this film down a bit.The plot was a bit slow, too much emphasis on the dialogue, and the film didn't feel 'dynamic.'But, I enjoyed how Tarantino drug out the villain reveals. The movie felt as if I was playing a game of Mafia/Werewolves.The drama was satisfying. The gore was satisfying. The resolution was satisfying.2.5/5. Tarantino could have done better.",5,1,5,4 March 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Perfect Cold War Satire Movie
",A Cold War satire that proves relevant even today. Comedy still holds strong and in quick succession.Special appreciation to Peter Seller's portrayal of four different characters within the movie. I didn't even notice it was all the same actor until reading about the movie after! Amazing work for everyone involved.5/5. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You won't regret it.,10,3,3,13 January 2020
The Beach," Mediocre but enjoyable
","The Beach is an anti-tourism movie seen through the eyes of a tourist.Both the film and the book follow the experiences of Richard, a young traveler looking to explore something outside the beaten roads most tourists follow. He catches wind of a secret, idyllic, untouched beach from 'Daffy Duck' who kills himself shortly after. Richard then goes on to find this mystical beach but finds that paradise isn't all that it seems to be.Some differences remain between the film and the book. Director Danny Boyle takes some artistic liberties that make the plot a bit different than Alex Garland's book. With this, Boyle is still able to build on Garland's initial points laid out in the book. Most changes are believable and the film can be enjoyed as a standalone. The artistic liberties Boyle takes also help drive the plot a bit faster than the book.The casting of young Leonardo DiCaprio is genius as he seems to encapsulate the character of Richard well. The world-building of a dirty, rotten tourist hell that Richard wants to avoid is also well created. Audiences can see why residents at the beach want to keep it hidden from the outside world. Watching this movie also captures the 'tourist vs traveler' mindsets perfectly well.Outside all the positives that this film has to offer, this film has some flaws. Namely, the film itself isn't that exciting. It seems to miss the 'awe' moment that Richard feels when he comes to the island. It also seems to force some plot points for the sake of moving the story. Some events seem forced and not believable.Though there were some scenic moments, the film seems to be a collection of events from the book rather than a cohesive collection. And I find that this film's biggest flaw.But I wouldn't blame this on Boyle's directing or DiCaprio's acting. Sometimes it's hard to create a book-to-film adaptation.3/5. Mediocre but enjoyable.",6,1,1,26 April 2020
The Expendables," All bets pay off for this movie
","Normally when you pump this many A-list stars into a single stage it starts to be a bit crowded. A 'too many cooks' moment.But not this movie.This movie is a testosterone-fuelled action movie porn from beginning to end. Explosions, gunplay, and cheap one-liners that break other movies somehow works for The Expendables.This movie even inspired a (very) satisfying video game that I love to this day (the Expendabros, if y'all were wondering).4.5/5. Good for those who enjoy turning on a good action flick and turning off their brains for an hour or two.",9,1,1,5 March 2020
Scary Movie 2," Stupid pothead humor

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," An Instant Burton Classic
","A Tim Burton masterpiece. This was one of my first introductions into the movie musicals. A great retelling of a Victorian-era tale.Loved the acting, dedication to the original legend, and story. Acting and character development held strong in this movie. One of the few films where I understand and emphasize which each character.Actors did an amazing job. Ending resonated with me far after the end credits.Murder scenes were a bit overdone and bloody. Felt queasy at times but enjoyed Burton's mastery of color. Red blood contrasted sharply from the black and grey palette of the entire movie.4.5/5. This made it on my list of favorites. Enjoyable and a must watch for musical lovers. Only hope y'all have a strong stomach.",9,3,4,13 January 2020
Malcolm X," Holy cow, what a good movie!
","Malcolm X is a powerful, three-hour tribute to which the man movie names itself. This epic of a film guides its viewers through the evolution of Malcolm X's philosophy in each phase of his life.Spike Lee could not have selected a better cast for this film. Denzel Washington delivers a performance full of heart and passion. Truly both Spike & Washington at the prime of their careers. There were times I was convinced I was watching the real Malcolm X many times in the film.For a biopic, the plot will be straightforward. Yet, I found the dedication to each tiny detail in each era of Malcolm X's life was both painstaking and rewarding. The set designs, costumes, and music were all loyal to the sign of the times. The film also follows each stage of Malcolm X's philosophies without saying which is right or wrong. The film is well-rounded and makes its audience understand each decision made.This movie is loyal to its source material and viewers can tell that Spike Lee did his research. It pushed boundaries as far as can be reasonably told in a three-hour movie. I also enjoyed the final montage as it showed Malcolm X's far-reaching impact. I was even surprised to see Nelson Mandela make a cameo in the film. You don't see that every day.4.5/5. A loyal and timeless classic from Spike Lee. Stellar performances by Denzel Washington and the crew. Doubt any other biopic about Malcolm X could top this.",9,3,4,17 December 2019
The Town," Must-see for those looking for a good heist movie
","An iconic American bank robbery film that pays homage to Boston. Not many movies can do that.It's not Heat, but it tries to be and deserves recognition for what it achieves. The creepy nun mask bank robbers burn an image into the mind of the viewers that keep them remembering this film for years to come.The action and plot are a bit straightforward. It's a cat and mouse game between the cop and robber. The twists and turns as each seek their own goals leaves us at the edge of our seat.Loved how this film paid homage to Boston and stayed true to the scenery and people.One complaint though, the romance subplot did feel a bit cheesy. But it's a forgivable sin.4.5/5.",9,1,1,5 March 2020
Taxi Driver," Unique character study into the mind of a shooter
",A Robert De Niro classic that provides an interesting character study into masculinity and what it means.4.5/5.,9,1,1,3 March 2020
Interstellar," Perfect Sci-Fi Film
","Interstellar is how a good sci-fi movie should be.Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's experimental space epic almost half a decade in the making. There was extra work taken to ensure scientific accuracy and artistic quality. All of it pays out at the end of this unforgettable film.Interstellar is a beautiful, slow yet intense move that spans for about three hours. Though it does take time to move the plot, more is done in for the sake of exposition and world(s)-building. The visual effects of this film are astonishing.Also, I applaud Nolan's decision to hire Hans Zimmer on this masterpiece. Without his mesmerizing work, this film would have felt incomplete.Interstellar came out at a time there was waning government interest in space. Funding was cut for NASA and we were unsure if we'd ever launch a space mission again. But with the success of Interstellar among other events, we're back to seeing space exploration in the cultural mainstream. The cultural impact of this movie cannot be forgotten when discussing this film.5/5. Favorited. Stellar (heh) performance by all actors and those who worked on this film.",10,0,2,13 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Face It: You Knew It Was Going to Be Bad
","Face it: Like every other Star Wars diehard fan, you've been used to disappointment. You knew this film will most likely be another disappointment after being let down from TLJ. Yet, like every other diehard fan, you still went out to Theater to see this film.I know because I am one of those diehard fanboys. And I'm glad I'm now done with the (now) finale of the emotional rollercoaster we know was the Star Wars Saga.Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker tries to maintain the magic of the original while salvaging what was left from the previous episode. There are many nods to the previous episodes and some attempts at genuine humor in this film. Expect a ton of nostalgia fanservice. Yet, all the goodwill Disney tries to impose on this film isn't enough to save it.There are massive plotholes that I won't disclose -- I'll let the YouTubers do that. There are characters that don't resonate with the audience. Loose ends don't get wrapped up. Where there are scenes that could have a significant consequence, Disney continues to play it safe and continue to please fans wanting nostalgia.If you are a Star Wars fan, this movie won't make much sense. If you are new to Star Wars, this film won't make much sense. As a standalone movie, this film cannot hold up by itself.1/5. Better than TLJ, but not enough to save this sinking ship. Forgettable at best and a disservice to fans at its worst.",2,16,25,6 January 2020

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Aged like spoiled milk
","If it wasn't for Phantom Menace, this would easily be the worst Star Wars movie out of the original 6. Don't get me started on the new ones.The story drags on too slow. Too much time is dedicated to discussing politics and setting up a scene for a final CGI eyesore-fest. Anakin comes off as a cringey creeper who lusts for a woman more than twice his age. Mommy issues, anyone?1/5. 1 full star for action, clean 'feel,' and being better than Phantom Menace. That doesn't mean that this movie is good by any means. Don't be surprised if you fall asleep during a showing of this.",2,2,4,20 February 2020

The Godfather: Part II," A must-watch, great standalone or must-see for Godfather fans!
",A great continuation of the world that was introduced to us in the original Godfather. This work would make even Mario Puzo himself proud.Found the duality between father and son poetic. Great way to show how Don Vito and Michael forged their own paths with different motivations. Every character had their own motivations that were understandable and believable. Not to mention the conniving Hyman Roth being an excellent villain. The ending was especially chilling as both protagonists were worlds apart when they achieved the same goal... solidifying their power.Justice was also done to make the film feel like the eras portrayed. It felt as if I was seeing real scenes of 1920 Italian New York slums and the rise of Las Vegas in the 1950s. Beautiful.The only problem I had with The Godfather: Part II was how Robert De Niro looked nothing like Don Vito. Should I hold that against him? Definitely not considering his stellar performance.5/5. A must-watch for lovers of the Godfather or good films in general.,10,1,1,4 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," *Spoilers & Plotholes
","What's with music biopic movies that never makes them good?Too many years to squeeze in, I guess.I enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody. Rami Malek gives us a convincing Freddie Mercury performance. Music is good and humor is there. Timeline of some events was changed for theatrical effect.Good.But the movie never feels that any of the characters have the struggle to overcome. Freddie Mercury joins the band 15 minutes in and he's an instant celebrity. The rest of the movie is about his celebrity status with his band in the background.Where is the conflict?I'm sure that the longest argument in the movie lasts only 2 minutes before they give in to Freddie Mercury. He resolves a long issue with his parents with a quick introduction of his boyfriend. His antagonist gives him up with ease. Everyone, in the end, agrees with Freddie.The band never faces a real crisis and everyone gets back together without fighting. Exciting.Even the antagonist doesn't give a convincing performance. His evolution is not understood or shown in the movie.The ending is ok but doesn't make sense.2.5/5. I know these music biopics are never good but I keep watching them. Am I a sucker for pain?",5,5,6,10 March 2020
Bird Box," Did the fanboys see another version of the movie?
","Did people see another version of this movie that I didn't see? Because this film was so bad I couldn't finish it. The premise of the film is simple and forward, but fails on delivery. Hard.Sure, 'Bird Box' isn't 'A Quiet Place,' but non-book readers won't be able to tell the difference. Nor do they care.This film lacked actual monsters and the characters face an entity they never see. Much less makes sense. Are the entities aliens or supernatural beings? The movie stays in the middle the whole time and never answers our questions.Rules that seem to make sense get broken later in the film. Random twists and turns get added to build 'suspense' but end up annoying the audience instead.Though the lineup is great, the cast that lacks real chemistry. Each character is lazily killed off until we're left with Bullock and her two UNNAMED children. I guess the plot is so badly thought out they forgot to give them names.Effects were alright at best. But cliched and don't deserve applause.Finally, the namesake of the film, bird boxes, get introduced late into the film. The bird boxes themselves add little besides build suspense. The film does no justice in explaining if other animals are able to sense the antagonists either. What makes the birds so special?.5/5. I'm surprised at how Netflix-directed movies are one category that can consistently disappoint.",1,6,10,10 March 2020
Watchmen," A superhero epic that's worth the watch
","Jesus Christ, what an epic movie. THIS is how you do a comic book adaptation.
Watchmen is a three hour film-fest of gritty, alternate-universe, dystopian 80's America. Watchmen takes no shortcuts in storytelling and world-building. Following Alan Moore's original, this film is a faithful adaptation.Showing a darker side of superheroes (before Amazon's The Boys), Watchmen plays like a detective whodunit. Progressing, Watchmen goes deeper and deeper into the underbelly of this alternate universe. Though there are 'superheroes' in the movie, very few are 'heroes.' Each character is nuanced and multifaceted. Drama between each of the characters exists and feels real.How can I even begin to review this epic of a film?Let's begin with the plot. The plot twists and turns into different directions but all explorations are appreciated. One of the things I use to judge a film is by its antagonist. The villain's motivation in Watchmen feels real and believable. Stuck between a potential nuclear threat with the US & USSR, the villain does what he must to save humanity.The cinematography in this film adds to this dark, seedy underbelly of alt-NYC. Rainy, dark, and gritty scenes dominate this film throughout. Visuals are absolutely beautiful.The action is pure eye candy. Where most superhero films nerf their violence, Watchmen leaves little to imagination. Teeth are broken, legs are blown off, and people blown to bloody bits. I've rarely seen a film like this before.And the music? Awesomeness in every sense of the word. Could not have thought of better musical options for this film even if I tried. Kudos to Zach Snyder and his crew.But, there are downsides. I found myself more annoyed at the audio more than anything. The audio ranges from ultra-quiet dialogue to monstrous booming action sequences. While watching this film, I had to reach for the remote many times trying to capture dialogue and turning down the volume during periods of loud violence. Definitely could've been more care done here. But the other aspects of the film make up for this in many other ways.4.5/5. This is a film for fanboys and newbies alike. Groundbreaking and ahead of its time.",9,1,4,22 March 2020
The Italian Job," One of those movies that never gets old
","Not sure what it is about Italian Job, but it's one of those movies you can see hundreds of times and it'll feel like the first time watching it.It's a mix between a heist and vengeance movie. Italian Job gives us satisfying action mixed with sweet justiceporn. The movie is well done serves its purpose.Who else can make Mini Coopers look so fun to drive? I'm sure this movie had a big part in selling those cars for many years.4.5/5.",9,1,1,5 March 2020
Baby Driver," Fun Car-Chase Thriller Action Drama
","A brisk action thriller that includes fast cars, guns, and a good selection of music.Though I enjoyed the scenes, the movie is forgettable and presents nothing new to the table. It's a fun movie, yes, but feels like a pulp fiction of the genre. The storyline is shallower than a kiddie swimming pool.3/5. Average and forgettable. The movie does keep a good pace, but that's not enough to save it.",6,3,4,13 January 2020

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Upset this wasn't combined with final film
","The fact that the final book was broken into two parts upsets me like no other. It's not even the longest book in the Harry Potter series!Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is basically a drag and a setup for the final film. People now have to watch this so they can understand what transpired before the final film. Instead of combining Part 1 & 2 for a larger finale, it was decided to squeeze the series for a bit more cash.The end result of the above process is a film with a few interesting parts and a ton of filler. There's a lot of drag in this one that could have been cut out.Of course, as usual with Potterverse films, there's action, comedy, etc. But this film awkwardly transitions from months at a time to days. The pacing is all off and a mess..5/5. Removed extra for the unnecessary filler and the fact that this wasn't combined with Part 2 for a single film. Though, I did love Dobby.",1,0,0,16 May 2020

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A love letter to true Spider-Man fans.
","When I thought I was done with Spider-Man origin stories, this film comes out. Who else loves a good multiverse movie?Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a movie that pokes fun at the franchise while paying it homage. The movie is great for first-time watchers and lifelong fans. There are great comedic and some emotional moments that stay with you long after the film.Characters' portrayals are amazing. Everyone's actions and motivations are relatable and understandable as well. The audience is able to connect with any character better than most movies I've seen.Did I mention how beautiful the film is? The visuals and soundtrack go hand in hand. This decision to animate this movie like a comic book is well appreciated. Also loved the great variation style/sound with each character. It's amazing how the soundtrack blends with each character.5/5. Definitely deserves its place among one of the best Spider-Man movies out there.PS: Amazing post-credit scene btw.

Apocalypse Now," A brutal, bloody masterpiece.
","Some people argue that Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest movies ever made. After watching this film, I can understand their side of the argument. After further research into this film, I have only learned to love this film even more.Watching Apocalypse Now is like observing a slow descent into madness. More than observing, the audience is actively descending into this madness itself. Martin Sheen as Captain Willard lets the audience get into the mind of a soldier slowly losing it. His performance in this film is unmatchable. As Captain Willard gets closer to his goal, we can see how things begin to unravel piece-by-piece. The river itself as a metaphor of the slow descent.Marlon Brando, for his brief appearance in the film as Colonel Kurtz, shows the other side of the madness. The soldier who actually lost his mind and let the war consume him. Chilling and provocative.And I couldn't help but notice that Harrison Ford and Laurence Fishburne made appearances in this film. Truly an AAA+ cast all around.The set pieces used in this film are unmatchable. In a world of pre-CGI, practical effects were the way to go. And this film is far from short of that. Explosions, gunfire, the gore is on full display. The war itself is an unforgiving meat grinder that doesn't differentiate between American or Vietnamese.Francis Ford Coppola made a masterpiece with this film. Very few war films will be able to match the bar set by Apocalypse Now.5/5.",10,0,0,16 May 2020
Rocky IV," Rocky IV punches above its weight
","I'm not sure which I like better: Rocky I or Rocky IV. Either way, both hold my top favorite Rocky movies of all time. A fitting conclusion to the (original) Rocky series.Maybe it's the poetic struggle between the US and USSR. Maybe it's Rocky avenging Apollo's sad demise. Or maybe I just enjoyed the music and training montages.5/5. Have watched, rewatched, rewatched, rewatched, and rewatched time and time again.",10,0,1,10 March 2020
Spider-Man," An almost perfect adaptation
","You cannot convince me that no one else makes a better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire.As someone who was part of the 90s Spiderman hype, this film came out at the perfect time. This film still holds solid after 16 years despite the various reboots. Not to mention the upside-down movie kiss that stays a Hollywood movie classic.They should have ended the series at Tobey's depiction of Spiderman, but I understand that people need to make money on their licensing contracts.5/5. No other depiction of Spiderman can beat this.",10,1,3,5 March 2020
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Not my favorite of the series
","If there is a Harry Potter film that could be removed w/o contributing much to the plot, I'd say it's either this one or the seventh one.Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban continue the Harry Potter story about an escaped prisoner who may be out to harm Harry. Of course, there is a concern for Hogwarts as the inevitable fight between good and evil continues once again. Yet, I found the eventual plot twist so distasteful and unbelievable that it crashed my suspension of belief & ruined the film for me.This movie is a bit darker than the previous two films before it. We can slowly see a shift in Potter's loss of childlike innocence as he is prepared for the next installments of the series. It's a theme that I felt the series cannot be without.2.5/5.",5,0,0,23 April 2020

American History X," Powerful Character Study & Must Watch!
","American History X is a character study that examines what makes an American Nazi and how to overcome such thinking.The film also examines the secondary effects that racism and racist ideology can have on others around you. We see not just the redemption of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) but also what his way of thinking has cost him.The casting, pacing of the plot, and cinematography are all top-notch. Topics covered in this film are not easy to discuss and this movie will be hard to watch for some.

Django Unchained," Must see.
","I knew this film would be good, but I didn't know it would be THAT good. This is Quentin Tarantino at his finest.Django Unchained has all of the Tarantino trademarks.

The only thing missing is a scene involving feet.The film is also justice porn at its finest. Django, a former slave, seeks revenge on the slavers who contributed to his (and his brethren's) condition. Tarantino gives us this simple plot and lets his characters run loose.Speaking about characters, what an AMAZING cast. Everyone including Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Samuel L Jackson, Jonah Hill (a pleasant surprise), and many others deserve every reward and praise they get for this movie. The head of cinematography, Robert Richardson, and the entire sound team (Harry Cohen, Tony Lamberti, Branden Spencer, Dror Mohar, Wylie Stateman, Michael Minkler, and Michael Wilhoit) deserve special praise as well.This film is original.

It's dreamlike and surreal in certain parts and refreshingly intense in others.It's bloody, beautiful, and well thought out.

Little things such as a dropped book leave the heart speeding. I enjoyed the story-telling, the plot, and the characters.Also, enjoyed the use of ASL during the movie. It's a skill more people should know.Though the replayability of this film is quite low, I'd still rate this a 5/5. Great film.

1917," Single gimmick but that's about it
","Once you get over 1917's one single gimmick, you realize it's not that great of a war movie.1917 is a one-shot film based during WWI. The plot is rather simple: deliver a letter across enemy lines or else thousands will die. It's straightforward and the action moves quickly.One area that I appreciate about this film is the respect it pays to WWI. Special attention is given to the hell-like conditions that the soldiers had to face. 1917 does an excellent job showing how the Great War turned normal men into savages. It also did a great job showing the life-and-death conditions that people faced.But, there were times I felt disconnected from the film. Is it from the dizzying speed the camera moves around? Is it the lack of character development and cheesy dialogue? Is it from the rather cliche plot? I felt no real connection to the characters until close to the end. Shame that this movie was missing that special something.1917 is a good movie to watch. Yet, I wouldn't call it too memorable. With a bit more polishing, this could have been a much stronger movie.3/5 or 3.5/5. Average or above average. Sam Mendes was missing that special something to take this movie to the next level.",6,3,9,25 January 2020

8 Mile," Scratch below the surface and you'll realize it's not that great of a movie
","8 Mile tells the story of Eminem without telling the actual story of Eminem.A Broke, white-trash kid rises up through the tough Detroit rap scene. The premise is good and portrays Detroit's musical underground well.The movie does a damn good job at building the scene of desperation that comes with extreme poverty. This is a side of America that doesn't get covered too much in movies. But as the movie progress, the movie keeps beating that same bush again and again.Hate to be that guy, but more film time could have been dedicated to progressing the story. No need to show constant reminders how bad B-Rabbit, Eminem's character, has it.First off, the good.There's real chemistry between every actor. You get a real sense of camaraderie between B-Rabbit and his crew. You'll understand the conflict between Eminem, his mom, and Greg. The character development is well-done.The director took special attention to keep the story true to its setting and time. Set design and soundtrack are on point. The tiny details are well taken care of.But that's where I draw the line.I couldn't agree with the plot. We never understand why winning a rap contest means so much for B-Rabbit. If it's held weekly, then it shouldn't be such a big deal to lose and/or win. Even in the film, he loses one week to win in another. B-Rabbit's goals do not make sense at all. Some of B-Rabbit's actions in the film doesn't make sense, either.And the antagonists don't get much character development at all. They don't even say much at all. There are only a few lines spoken by the 'boss' in the entire film. How can I understand the antagonist(s) if they don't even speak?The ending itself feels a bit...empty. B-Rabbit wins a rap contest, but his situation is still the same. He got a lucky break but he could be in the same spot next week. The film doesn't feel complete at all.If more time was spent on the screenplay, it could have been far better.2/5. Hope my brother isn't reading this review.

Told in unchronological order, the plot is both interesting and stylish. Acting is superb with a cast as eccentric as Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, among others.And I didn't even get started on the soundtrack of this film.4.5/5.

Yet, Order of the Phoenix shines best by its use of character development.Character development in this film is superb. The audience learns to hate Umbridge even more (great work by Imelda Staunton, btw) and love Sirius Black. We are introduced to just how sociopathic and murderous Bellatrix can be.

Midsommar," The most beautiful horror film I've ever seen
","Unsettling pagan horror at its best. One of the most beautiful, unsettling horror films that I have ever seenMidsommar is a 2.5 hr dream that slowly unwinds into a nightmare. The lack of jumpscares was interesting. Ari Aster focuses more on building horror through unsettling imagery with great effect.Pacing may turn some viewers off, but I hold to my belief that Ari Aster knew exactly what he was doing. Aster takes his time worldbuilding this Swedish daylight nightmareland. Cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski and composer Bobby Krlic do a stunning job creating an audiovisual acid trip gone horribly wrong. The film is beautiful on every level imaginable.Florence Pugh delivers a solid performance as a heartbroken, confused girl who finds acceptance through the cult. The audience will emphasize with all characters as they get more and more repulsed by the traditions of the Swedish cult. It's hard not to see yourself wondering what you'd do if in the same shoes as the characters.Midsommar is a horror film that will take you in and genuinely scare you if you let it. Though highly artistic in nature, it may not be for everyone. Especially not for those seeking jumpscares with their significant other.5/5. The most beautiful horror films I've ever seen.

Sicario," Tense, Dark, and Gritty
","Found this movie more exciting than expected.Moved a bit slow but enjoyed how complex each character was. Lots of moral grey areas that were highlighted. Yet, found Emily Blunt's character annoying and felt like she was dragged on like a sandbag throughout most of the movie.3.5/5. Did enjoy how this movie expand a lot on Mexican narco culture, yet felt as if there was lots of fluff that slowed the story.",8,0,0,4 November 2019
Pulp Fiction," A masterpiece without a message
",This film is amazing. Hands down. There is a reason why Pulp Fiction posters remains a constant staple in college dorm rooms.5/5. Quentin Tarantino's finest work. Damn quotable too.,10,3,5,20 February 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The Potter movie that started it all.
","Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.This film is an introduction to the cultural phenomenon surrounding the Harry Potter universe. With book-to-movie adaptations, there are many things that can go astray. Yet Philosopher's Stone seems to capture the wonderment and childhood terror that makes the series a cross-generational classic.Also kudos to the actors. Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, et al. gave a stellar performance that charms audiences around the world.It's a charming firm, lighthearted, and whimsical. There's a ton of world-building that lets audiences' imaginations run wild. The film itself is an impressive watch. Even if the CGI seems a bit dated at some places... but is that a fair critique for a 19 y/o film?Personally, one complaint I had was how fast time seemed to move in this film. We move from month to month rather disorientingly. But you try compressing a school year in a single 2-hour movie.The other complaint was based on how things seemed to happen too perfectly for Harry. But I understand that is the book's fault & not the movie's.3.5/5. Great to watch with family and friends.",7,0,1,9 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not that great tbh, could've been much much better
","The Harry Potter movie where they all had long hair and everyone had awkward love scenes.Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.Given the source material and worldbuilding, this movie could have been much better. We are introduced to many new things in this movie like the quidditch world cup, a cool tournament, and Voldemort. Yet this film focuses too much on flash instead of substance.There are some undeniably cool scenes, but they make no sense once revisited upon second thought. How are the death eaters able to attack a WORLD tournament so easily, especially when EVERYONE is armed with a potentially lethal weapon? How come we haven't been introduced to other schools before and how come we never hear from them again? Also, why TF should anyone care about Cedric? He has never been introduced to the series before.I appreciate that this film is the first of the series to receive a PG-13 rating and has darker themes than previous movies. Yet, the love stops there. It felt more like a self-service for fanboys/girls and nothing more. This film by itself cannot be a good standalone movie.And don't get me started on the awkward 'love' scenes that this film tries to incorporate in it. Felt forced and was bleugh.1.5/5. Some good moments. Some cool new things to add to the Potterverse. Introduction of the long-awaited antagonist. But nothing much else outside of that.",3,0,0,28 April 2020
The Untouchables," Not historically accurate, but still an alright movie
","A glossy look at the peak of the Chicago mafia era.The number of A-listers appearing is surprising. Started this movie not knowing what to expect and loved seeing so many well-known faces. Though, seeing Andy Garcia act did make me want to hurl. The acting was cheesy in some parts. Take, for example, Sean Connery's horrendous 'Irish' accent or breathing 'dead' people.Attire and set design in this movie were visual eye-candy. Giorgio Armani did a nifty job making sure everyone's suit were a sign of the times and roles. Chicago was visually stunning and the movie portrayed the classical Windy City well.The action scenes pepper the movie well and leaves enough to not bore.For all its pluses, two things bothered me about this movie.For starters, the cheesy musical score was distracting and felt ripped from a cheap 90s film. Nothing in the musical score was memorable or added much to the movie. I found myself more annoyed by the music than anything. Punches and gunshots sounded off and didn't match what was on screen. Out of all the money spent on this movie, more should've been spent on sound design.Second, historical inaccuracies were glaring. The operation itself was a lot less flashy than what the movie makes it out to be. A lot fewer people died than what was in the movie. But this can be forgiven, Hollywood has to sell a story somehow.For all that it gives and takes, this movie was a tough one to rate. I'll have to settle on a 3/5. Average at best. The movie aims too high above the bar and misses its mark.Though critically received at the time, this movie felt a bit too cheesy and cliche for my tastes. Scenes were predictable, music was horrendous, and Sean Connery's accent was damnable.I'd recommend this to those interested in Prohibition-era Chicago culture... but not for those with an eye for historical accuracy.",6,0,3,25 January 2020
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Best of the series IMHO.
","Chamber of Secrets captures the best aspects of the Harry Potter series. It's quirky, fun, filled with childlike wonder. Honestly, this was my favorite of the series.Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the 2nd of the 8 Harry Potter films. It's a classic gem that holds up well even by today's standards. The jokes are funny, comedy is slapstick, and the plot leaves the audience at the edge of their seat. This is definitely an improvement on the first film IMHO.Action scenes are great and genuinely tense. The story is great even for someone who wasn't raised in the Potter fandom like myself.Amazing movie.4.5/5.",8,0,1,23 April 2020
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Hidden gem
","A nice love story went wrong. Mr. & Mrs. Smith covers the real-life romance between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.Kidding, but this movie does what it intends to do. Present us a comedic situation where two married assassins are pitted against each other in an explosive fashion.3.5/5. Cheap but enjoyable. A pulp fiction action/romcom film of the 2000s era.",7,4,5,4 March 2020
The Departed," Great American Adaption of an HK Classic
",Nice enjoyable action that follows its Hong Kong counterpart closely. Makes sense since this movie was an American adaptation.4/5. Enjoyed the ending and the fact that there isn't 2 sequels that came out after this one.,8,0,1,4 November 2019
Die Hard," The perfect Christmas movie
","There's something special about Die Hard (besides the Christmasy atmosphere).Die Hard comes from a time where action movies were bloody, violent, and rated R. Not these neutered PG-13 cuts we see so often nowadays. People curse, there's lots of blood and guns, and Die Hard isn't ashamed of being more on the realistic side.That being said, this movie gets extra points for its realism. What makes this movie able to capture the audience is the fact John McClane is a regular guy. He's not the invincible action star of contemporary action flicks.You don't know if his life is actually in danger. You know that the movie will end good but you don't know how. There's real tension scene to scene. And that makes the film that much more enjoyable.Not to mention that it's damn quotable.5/5. Modern action thrillers should take note.PS: Die Hard IS a Christmas movie.",10,0,0,19 March 2020
All Quiet on the Western Front," Timeless WWI movie from a German perspective
","Judging by how long ago this movie has been made, I really don't think other films can tell its message in such a compelling and memorable way.All Quiet is a story of a naive German boy who becomes desensitized to the horrors of war. It's a tragic character study as we watch one young man lose his innocence. A sad story for many of those who had to fight at such a young age.Not to mention that bone-chilling ending.5/5. It deserves it. Y'all should also check out the book if y'all have time.",10,2,2,5 March 2020
Sausage Party," Hot Vulgar Trash
",A Seth Rogan flick that offered no apologies for its sex jokes and stereotyping. Still found it more entertaining than expected. Brings me back to the era of those cheap but entertaining Adult Swim-style cartoons.3.5/5. Cheap sex jokes that inspire nothing more. Politically incorrect animation film that the teenager/manchild crowd would love.,7,2,2,18 February 2020
Joker," A New Take on the Joker
","Being used to disappointment by Hollywood, I'm always a bit wary of over-hyped movies. Especially when the hype precedes a major release. But the Joker delivers on all expectations and then some.Joker is an interesting character study into the descent of madness -- always a fun topic. Yet, the film goes beyond its protagonist and examines the forces that allow such evils to exist. Make no mistake, this film is dark, nihilistic, and gritty.There is also something authentic about superhero movies without actual superheroes. Joker's lack of superpowers lets the viewer put themselves in the protagonist's shoes. I also appreciate films that allow its audience to emphasize its villain. The fact that this character transformation can (and has) happen in our real-world adds another layer to the dark nature of the film.If the themes don't make the film dark enough, the cinematography and violence will. The entire film is run through a dark green filter that creates a dreadful mood throughout. Violence is R-rated and leaves little to the imagination. A much-appreciated move considering the overabundance of PG-13 movies out there.Soundtrack is beautiful and is artful. It's obvious that careful thought was placed for each scene for music and composition. The darkest scenes of utmost despair paired with soundtrack dissonance is stunning.Yet, the film seems somewhat incompatible with the DC version of the Batman universe. With the disconnect between this film and DC, it makes the film no better than Taxi Driver with clown make-up. But the ambiguity that comes with an unreliable narrator leaves lots of room for imagination. Not a lot of points to be taken off there.4.5/5. Beautiful, artistic, and dark. Easily Joaquin Phoenix's magnum opus so far.",9,0,2,16 October 2019
Whiplash," A movie that stays on the beat!
","When I first watched this movie, I didn't understand why the instructor was being such an asshole. Now, after revisiting this film, I understand why.The underlying message of sacrifice in order to achieve greatness is well-told. Characters had their own motivation and challenges along every step of the way. Music and fast drum beat keep you awake throughout.Great storytelling.5/5.",10,0,1,20 February 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Raunchy, chaotic, hysterial, but worth every minute
","I don't know how to begin to review this epic of a movie.Wolf of Wall Street is a 3-hour of drugs, sex, and financial crimes. It highlights some of the extremes of excess told in a way that Jordan Belfort would tell his own story.Wolf of Wall Street plays like a rollercoaster from one extreme to another. Its extremes keep its viewers attached to the screen not wanting to miss a single second. Chaos reigns supreme in this film.Leonardo DiCaprio did an astonishing job portraying Belfort. He grunts, yells, and f*cks his way to what should have been an Oscar win. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie also deliver award-worthy performances.Many kudos to Martin Scorsese for what he did for the screenplay. This movie isn't like Martin Scorsese's bread and butter films, but he delivers and then some. His approach in this film is both refreshing, hilarious, and an absolute thrill.The moral message underneath the film also shines upon the second visit. The film also (subtly) asks if it's ok to celebrate villainy and excess. Of course, the audience wants to cheer for the protagonist. But upon further thought, the viewers, like many of Belfort's victims have allowed him to pull another wool over our eyes. The image of excess covers the true financial crimes that Belfort committed.5/5. Favorited. I wouldn't recommend to watch with family and kids, though.",10,0,1,22 March 2020
Con Air," Impossible to Hate
","Though I abhor Nicolas Cage's fake accent, I enjoyed this film a lot. Lots of action, simple plot, and some comedic moments. Isn't that what the 90's were about?4.5/5. One of my favorite nonserious action films from the era.",9,0,1,6 November 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," All Star Cast; All Star Movie
",One of Will Ferrell's iconic and memorable performances. Not to mention the first time many of us were introduced to the laugh riot known as Steve Carell.Anchorman is genuinely funny and tries to not go too over-the-top.4/5.,8,1,1,5 March 2020
Jaws," Low budget horror at its best
",This is how horror movies should be. More focus on suspense-building rather than cheap jumpscares. Especially loved how they don't freaking spoil showing Jaws too many times.5/5. If only more horror movies are like this.,10,3,6,20 February 2020
Kingpin," Typical 90's Pulp Comedy -- Turn off your brain and enjoy
",A typical 90's pulp fiction comedy movie.Kingpin is such a silly movie that knows that it's not going to take itself seriously. There's a certain charm with the over-the-topness humor that the film uses. Some great humorous moments that hold solid even by today's standard.3.5/5. Leave it up to the Farrelly Brothers to make a pretty solid comedy movie about bowling. Kudos to them for going places that no one else would.,7,0,1,30 October 2019
Hancock," SPOILERS**
","You know what I enjoyed about this film? Hancock is a genuine person with superpowers. He isn't above anyone, his motivations are the same as our own. We can relate to him.Will Smith does a good job of superstar-turned-bum-turned-superstar in this film. The acting didn't feel forced and the characters were believable.The only issue that I have with this film was towards the end. When Hancock was about to die, the criminals mentioned how 'everyone has their time.' What great way to end a movie with that message.Of course, Americans likes good endings so Hancock didn't die and everything turned out fine.But I always wonder, how much different this movie could have been if the ending was different.I'll fault that to a director's mistake.4/5. Still made my favorites list.",8,1,1,5 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Actually a solid prequel movie
","Say what you want, but I actually enjoyed this one out of the prequels.The action constant from beginning to end and enough time is spent on storytelling. A lot of the boring council scenes were cut out and the clones weren't portrayed as incompetent buffoons.Of course, the action is all surface-level as we all know how the original trilogy ends. But that gives us enough reason to turn off our brains and enjoy a good flashy show.4/5. I debated on a 3.5 but decided to give George Lucas a benefit of a doubt. Doesn't make my all-time favorite list, though.",8,1,2,20 February 2020
Inception," Christopher Nolan does it again!
","It's like Christopher Nolan took Heat-style heists, dropped a tablet of acid, and fell asleep.Inception is a heist movie with science fiction flairs. On the surface, that sounds basic. But Christopher Nolan showcases his brilliance by adding concepts and taking moviemaking to new heights.Action scenes are fun, effects are fun, and you never know where the plot will go. The sky is the limit here.4.5/5. It's fun, refreshing, and you never know what you're going to get. Ignore what you may know about sleep science and enjoy this movie.",9,1,3,5 March 2020
Defiance," Nothing groundbreaking
","Defiance tells an tale of extraordinary courage in the face of danger. Though the stories are admirable, they are not done the justice they deserve in this film.Defiance brings nothing new to the table that other war films have done and perfected. The movie does not stand out among its peers and is forgettable if anything.Characters feel two dimensional and certain scenes feel forced. Though the cast is compelling, dialogue and conflict don't feel 'real.'Zwick heads in the right direction but seems to miss his mark where things matter the most.2.5/5. Average, if anything. Shame, I wanted to enjoy this more.",5,1,1,4 November 2019
Lord of War," Stunning performance, solid underlying message, great movie
","It's not every day that Amnesty International endorses a movie.Lord of War is a cynical and nihilistic look at the arms dealing industry. The film does meticulous work covering every aspect of the industry. No apologies made for any controversy portrayed.The movie is well researched and the conflicts are all real. Some real-life names are different. but the details to smuggling methods and weapons smuggled were enlightening. Special commentary on the brutality of the trade was also eye-opening.But, overambition did drag this Lord of Wardown a bit. This film seeks to cram too much information. Some plot points seem forced and the story changes flow often. But I'd rather have a film telling me too much than too little.Also, another issue I had with Lord of War was that there were a few inaccuracies. The opening factory scene, for example, is not how real bullets are made. The beginning CGI was also a bit aged in some aspects. Some guns described were inaccurate. But these mistakes are forgivable since it didn't take too much away from the movie.I'd rate this film a 4/5. Highly recommended and worth a revisiting. A modern remake would do this film justice. Out of the many movies Nicolas Cage is in, this is one of my more favorite movies starring him.",8,3,3,5 March 2020
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A Perfect War Movie
","A heart-wrenching war movie about two Korean brothers fighting on the opposite sides of the war. A real story for many people who lived during this era.Great war movie for those wanting to learn more about Korean culture or the Korean War.During on re-watching of the climax, I left on Led Zepplin's Stairway to Heaven by accident and had goosebumps throughout.Be warned though: the action in this movie leaves no room for imagination. It's brutal and bloody, just like the war. So if you're squeamish about blood, you'll need to close your eyes more than once.5/5. Cannot stress how much I love this movie.",10,0,0,4 November 2019
Arrival," B.O.R.I.N.G.

Parasite," Brilliant Masterpiece of South Korean Filmmaking
","O.M.G... I knew Parasite was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THAT good.Parasite starts off with a simple premise. Yet, with what Bong Joon-ho accomplishes in this film is worthy of praise and reward. Every twist and turn is unexpected and the execution of the film is perfect.No other word I can use to describe this film: perfect.Every character in this film is ones that viewers can emphasize with. The themes of class conflict (also seen in Boon-ho's Snowpiercer) prevails in this film as well. It's stunning to see these dynamics play out.In parts where you expect to know how the story will turn out, another curveball is thrown that catches the viewer off-guard. Yet nothing destroys the suspense of reality. There were moments in the film where I was biting my nails in suspense.5/5. The timing, pacing, and execution of this film will be studied in future generations of filmmaking. This is by far one of the best films I've seen this year.",10,25,41,13 January 2020
Rango," Great Hidden Gem -- deserves to be rediscoverd!

Halloween," Great, original, and lasting horror
","Are we just going to ignore the fact that Michael Myers had his mask pulled off in this movie?All joking aside, this is a great low-budget movie that started the Halloween series as we know it.

Tombstone," An iconic film that's highly underrated
","Tombstone is everything a Western should be. It's simple, filled with violence & memorable characters, and absolutely BA.I'm usually not a Western fan, but this film may make me one.Tombstone is a historical fiction that follows the real-life Wyatt Earp. Kurt Russell plays the role of Wyatt with flawless brilliance. The Van Kilmer as Doc Holliday? Ingenious. And the villains (Powers Boothe as Curly Bill and Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo) were absolutely vile.It's a great script that pays respect to its source material. There are some biblical undertones that I'm too lazy to explore in this interview. And the world-building of the Wild West was perfect.You can watch this movie over and over again w/o losing any amount of love for it. It's that good.5/5. One of my top favorites of the genre.",10,2,3,23 April 2020
Blade Runner," Bit Slow But Visually Stunning
","Though the remastered version is literal eye candy, I can see why this was called 'Blade Crawler' when it first came out. Plot can move a bit slow and even had me doze during certain parts.Still, the influence that this film had in the creative world is unparalleled by most. But, judging by artistic expression alone is not enough to make a movie.3.5/5. Maybe 4/5 if I give it full credit for creating the cyberpunk genre.",7,1,3,6 November 2019
Casino Royale," BOND HAS RETURNED
","A breath of fresh life into the James Bond series.Casino Royale restarts the franchise with a more realistic, brutal take on Bond. The film strips away the excessive gadgetry and CGI that was a trend in previous titles. Thank god. This new direction helped set the tone for Daniel Craig 007 movies to come.The action sequences action-packed and satisfying. Though, the main villain(s) were a bit underdeveloped and the movie left us at a cliff-hanger. Some died a bit too fast, IMO.Some things still did break my suspension of reality. Why is such a high-stakes poker game have such lax security? Vesper can walk up to Bond while he's playing. Bond can walk away from the game uninterrupted for hours. People are found murdered and kidnapped but security/police is not alerted despite the clientele at the game.But besides that, I'm glad the film does great justice to its source material.4/5. One star off for some laziness in writing, still a great film.",8,1,4,19 March 2020
Trainspotting," Instant 90's Classic for 18+
","If you have not seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it.Danny Boyle's magnum opus and a film that lives well to this day. Covered the emotions of addiction and rehabilitation well. Also lots of cinematic experimentation that paid dividends.The story, actors, and musical scores makes you feel as if you're in GB during the 90s. Plot sometimes feels disorientated, like the drug addict trying to recover.5/5. Few movies has achieved what this has done in 1hr 35m.",10,0,1,6 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Absolutely A Must Watch
","Taika Waititi is either a genius or absolutely crazy.Jojo Rabbit is an absolute blast of a film from start to finish. It's a coming-of-age, over-the-top, war-drama. The film is both light in humor and heavy in topic. It handles darkest sides of war in the most childlike innocence. It's one of the most unconventional satire I've seen.Certain (obvious) aspects of this film can be divisive in today's culture. Yet, Taika Waititi handles every aspect of the film well. His role as an imaginary Asian-Hitler is a moment of comedic genius. For everything that could of went wrong with this film, themes and comedy are handled in an adult way. None of the jokes felt 'cheap' by any means. You will find yourself laughing and crying with this film.The casting choices work in harmony. Roman Griffin Davis's role as Jojo keeps the audience sympathetic to his character. Scarlett Johansson shows real mother-child chemistry with Jojo. Real (innocent) romance can be felt between Jojo and Thomasin McKenzie's character. Taika Waititi is over-the-top and hilarious -- as an imaginary friend should be.5/5. Absolutely see this film. It's a rollercoaster of emotion that will leave you feeling better at the end.",10,2,8,19 November 2019

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A great ending to the Potter series
","With this much investment in any series, it's hard to wrap things up nicely. Any slipup and audiences will disown the series. This is the fine line that writers and directors must master to put the finishing touches on their work.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 provide the satisfaction of a well-done ending. Shout-out to J. K. Rowling and David Yates for wrapping up the Harry Potter universe in a satisfying way.Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.The Deathly Hallows Part 2 is exactly what the audience has been waiting for. This is the final confrontation between Harry Potter and Voldemort. The cumulation of all the previous films. Good vs evil. A fight to the death. Etc.There is a big flashy battle. Not everyone survives. And the final showdown happens. The action felt real and wasn't distracting.The ending was satisfying. All loose ends were wrapped up and some things were left open enough for audiences to extrapolate.3.5/5.",7,0,0,16 May 2020

The Matrix," Original, ground-breaking cultural phenomenon
","What can you say? This is THE Matrix.If you had me choose one movie from the late 90s that best defined the Sci-Fi genre of its era, I would choose this movie. Period. No debate.The amount of original storytelling and worldbuilding in this movie is insane. This movie also incorporated new techniques such as CGI & special FX that added to the futuristic dystopia that the movie takes place in.Normally with a high budget film like this, sometimes the plot or themes would get lost in the amount of CGI & VFX. The Matrix did not compromise on anything. This is one of those films that will have you talking about it once you leave the theatre. Its effects on the wider culture are noticeable has this film has been parodied and referenced time and time again.And don't get me started on the action. Like Neo in The Matrix, this film bends the rules with what we can expect from any action genre. The use of slow-mo, CGI, and fast-paced kung fu fighting is amazing.5/5. It's original, ground-breaking, and a cultural phenomenon.",10,0,0,23 April 2020
Godzilla," Dissapointment
","So forgettable that I forgot I watched it after seeing it.Godzilla's 2014 remake is a modern take on the classic movie with a lot more CGI. Yet, it doesn't bring anything innovative or new to the table. All the cliches have been done since the classic. Audiences will yawn at the storyline and plot devices. It's the same tale we've seen a thousand times of a giant kaiju causing destruction that's somehow...good?2/5. Cheap Hollywood pulp fiction that 'tries to introduce a classic to a modern audience.'",4,2,2,22 March 2020
Casino," Your next favorite movie
","This is Robert De Niro's shining moment.Casino is more than a character study of someone running a Las Vegas casino. Casino captures the rise and fall of mob-controlled Vegas. It captures how lack of control, and later, overcontrol led the mob to destroy their golden goose. Casino, in short, is the story of Las Vegas becoming what we know it as today.The based-on-a-true-story format works well here. The action is believable and the times-of-the-era feel is well done. It was funny that when I went to Vegas all I could think about was how it felt like I was in this film instead of the other way around. That's some good storytelling.5/5. A must watch for anyone who enjoys mob films. Good job Scorsese.",10,3,5,4 March 2020

","When I first watched this film in 2015, I then understood what the hype was about.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fun spy film that pokes fun at the genre. Action and drama play out beautifully in this masterpiece. Each subplot helps paint this underground world of spies and supervillains.Also enjoyed the fact that they made Samuel L Jackson have a lisp the whole film. Never would I thought I'd see that.5/5.

The movie attempts to be warm and lovely but is stale throughout. Expect no surprises or plot twists. The film is full of cliches and storylines that you'll see coming.It's a feel-good high-budget movie that you will forget.2.5/5. Maybe a 3/5. Found it a bit too slow and dull for my tastes.,5,2,3,22 March 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Worst of the trilogy
","As someone who enjoyed the first film, I was expecting more out of this one. Yet I felt a bit cheated after watching this sequel.Storyline and plot were even more forgettable than the first. Not sure why people would try to mess with the unbeatable John Wick again.2/5. I understand why people would want more John Wick after seeing the first film. Yet, this film felt a bit rushed and deserved a bit more polishing.",4,0,2,25 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Instant Fav -- best of the OG trilogy
",My hands-down favorite of the original Star Wars trilogy. The dark side has started seeking their revenge after the destruction of the Death Star and Luke trains to become the Jedi master that his father once was.Enjoyed the higher budget compared to the first Star Wars movie and how the Empire actually wins a few battles this time. Makes the whole 'galactic war' seem more real.5/5. I'm sure the other fanboys have more extensive movie reviews for those who are interested.,10,1,1,20 February 2020
Incredibles 2," 14 Years in the Making
","A pretty good sequel that actually turned out pretty well. Perhaps it was a cash grab, but it was a good one at least.Voice acting was off-putting in some areas. The plot twist was predictable and action felt rushed in some areas. Also, a bit surprised no character seemed to age since the 14 years it took for the sequel to be made. Nevertheless, feel free to enjoy this one with the kids (or yourself if you were a big fan of the first).3/5",6,1,2,4 November 2019
Sin City," Unique Action Thriller
","I didn't read the comics so my review will suffer from some biases.Loved how the movie took a different artistic approach to create a unique comic-book noir world. The action was over the top and never underused. Some parts of the story made me lose my suspension of belief.Also, I was a bit annoyed by the plot armor that surrounded some characters...seriously, some just don't die. But I guess it's all for the sake of the plot.I wouldn't necessarily watch this again, but I would recommend to a friend or two.3.5/5",7,0,0,4 November 2019
Spectre," B-O-R-I-N-G
",A movie so boring that I fell asleep through it and had to rewatch it twice. Completely forgot about shortly after. Such a shame since this movie could have been much more.2 stars. And this is coming from a lifelong James Bond fan.,2,1,8,16 October 2019
Her," Thought experiment leads to an amazing movie
","Man falls in love with an OS to help overcome a recent breakup raises more questions than it should.'Her' explores the relationship people sometimes develop with the inanimate. The film raises questions about what does it mean to be human and to love. Joaquin's masterpiece performance will leave you laughing, crying, cringing, and feeling genuine heartbreak throughout. The entire film is damn near perfect.Did I mention the beautiful music score?4.5/5. Memorable, instant classic.",9,0,0,19 March 2020
Slumdog Millionaire," Beautiful Tale of Modern India
","Not sure why this film got such a bad rep. I enjoyed it a lot.Though the plot seems somewhat stretched, the story goes beyond a coming-of-age story. This is a story of modern-day India as a whole. Loved the setting, love interest, disliked the Bollywood dancing at the end.4/5. 1 star off for the end-credits Bollywood dancing.",8,1,3,6 November 2019
Donnie Darko," Instant Psych Thriller Classic
",A solid psychological thriller that somehow gets better the longer you watch. Twists and turns are great as long as you suspend your sense of reality. Loved how the ending tied everything together.A timeless classic.5/5. Maybe it's just because I love psychological thrillers that much.,10,1,2,6 November 2019
The Great Gatsby," Great modern retelling of a timeless classic
",A retelling of a classic story that became a classic in its own right. Loved the devotion to the source material without too much deviation.4/5. RIP Gatsby.,10,1,1,3 March 2020
Hustle & Flow," A film that's good if you don't think too hard about it
","A film that you would think is 'deep' if you saw it in 8th grade.Hustle & Flow is a 2005 music drama that follows the life of DJay as he seeks fame through music.The Good: The film is gritty and no character has a straight walk to success. The film keeps the audience on its toes cheering for the protagonist each step of the way. The setbacks suffered keep the carrot of catharsis always one step ahead.But upon further inspection, we see that where the film could have taken different directions (or the same ones further). Whenever the film had those opportunities, it hesitated. Many more decisions could have happened that'd give the movie a deeper meaning. Though the film means to show struggle, some important things happen too easily to be believable.Some character development is rushed for the sake of the plot but leaves holes in the plot. The film seems to rush a few too many points.Yet, Hustle & Flow is still an enjoyable film. Great to see if you want some drama that you don't want to dwell too much on.3/5. Average, enjoyable but not great.",6,0,0,17 December 2019
Princess Mononoke," Miyazaki does it again
",Beautiful and unique in its own way. Miyazaki does it again.4/5.,8,0,0,4 March 2020
Law Abiding Citizen," P Fun Action Flick -- nothing more
","Looking back, the whole 'I planned this massive elaborate plot years ago' looks a bit silly. I blame Skyfall for ruining that idea for me.Still a good thriller. Still wouldn't watch again.3/5. Nice and forgettable.",6,0,1,18 February 2020
V for Vendetta," Dark poetic beauty
","'Ideas are bulletproof.'With that one line, V for Vendetta solidified its place in movie history.V for Vendetta is a beautiful masterpiece! Though there seem to be some plot holes, this movie presents its message well and is damn quotable.V for Vendetta takes place in a near-future dystopian Great Britain. It's a world where an unjust totalitarian regime takes over the government. The movie makes us question what role we have when governments are no longer just.The lineup and acting are superb. There couldn't have been a better cast to help deliver the message behind V for Vendetta. 'V' delivers his lines with absolute charisma and charm. There are many, many quotable lines from this movie.The plot leaves the audience sitting at the edge of their seat as they learn more and more about V's world. The action is bloody and satisfying. The film leaves enough action to keep the heart pumping but not so much that it distracts from the story.Set design is well thought out. The use of color, darkness, and artwork adds another layer of subtlety that's beyond the initial viewing. The use of dark and dreary Great Britain with the well lit and beautiful past says a lot about the movie.Yet, I will have to take off a half-star for some plotholes. EV's and V's relationship dynamic seemed forced in some areas. The matrix-style knife throwing did seem out of place and aged. And why did the comedian do what he did? Even so, V for Vendetta is a great movie.But that ending, oh my! Instant chills!4.5/5. A timeless classic.",9,0,0,19 March 2020
The Island," Passed the time
","The Island brings an ethical dilemma about cloning into perspective.But there are a few plot holes. Like, wouldn't it be more efficient to grow organs to harvest instead of full fledged clones ? Why all the wasted energy in raising clones? What's going to happen to all the recently escaped clones? What about the people paying for those organ treatments?And don't get me started on that ugly 'pimped-out' PT Cruiser.I give this film a 3/5. Average and forgettable.",6,0,1,18 February 2020
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Comedy Gold
","This has to be my favorite Will Ferrell movies. No matter how many cable reruns I see it on, I always have to finish it. The movie is damn fun from beginning to end... and damn it's quotable.This movie came out 12 years ago and we still talk about it. How many movies can y'all say honestly do that?4.5/5.",9,1,1,5 March 2020
The Godfather," One of the best films ever made -- beautiful & poetic
","This film isn't for everyone, I admit that. But for those who enjoy a good story but don't mind the wait to climax, WATCH THIS.The story is the portrayal of the fall from grace of Michael Corleone. Michael is a tragic hero. Caught between an innocent outside world and the criminal underground of his family, he makes decisions we would've made as well.The plotline and characters are worlds in themselves. The city itself serves as a backdrop into the fascinating world that makes this film so great.The violence is satisfying, the scenery and camera work beautiful. Every scene in this film was a work of curated art. Not to mention the church scene which is instantly a memorable movie scene.What I especially enjoyed in this film was the dedication to the original book that Mario Puzo wrote. Reading the book after watching the film made me appreciate the attention to detail.5/5. Beautiful. A must watch.",10,1,1,4 March 2020
