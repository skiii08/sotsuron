The Equalizer," Not nearly as good as 1st one, sigh
","Of course Denzel is the man and makes all movies look good BUT this script was terrible. The action scenes good, fight scenes better but everything else average and predictable. Hopefully this is the last one.Side note: disappointed that Denzel's first sequel was something as blasé as this. Any of his previous movies made as a sequel would have had more of an impact.",6,0,0,23 July 2018
Wind River," Grows on You and Worth the wait
","Very well written and performances good by all. Great script and proper levels of action, drama and serious reflection. Wife wanted to give it a 10 as it had powerful points of view but 'keeping it real' forces me to give an honest point of view. Some scenes give less credit to professional peacekeepers/police-types but made the mood of movie grow in intensity. Probably not a movie for younger audience but can make an impression.",8,0,1,25 December 2017
Captain Marvel," Not one of the better Marvel pictures
","Pretty blasé and action disappointing. First, I'll admit I'm not a big Superman fan so of you like him than you'll probably enjoy Capt Marvel. I've always grouped Capt Marvel with Shazam so if that's your cup of tea....I definitely won't rush to big-screen for Shazam and disappointed I did so for this. Only because it's tied into Avengers series did I do so.Brie Larson over-rated but it was good seeing young Agents Fury and Coulson, lol.Wife and I snoozed during movie as the plot bounced around, sigh...glad I saw a Matinee, lol.Giving it a 6 for connecting dots on Avenger sequel.",6,3,5,18 March 2019
Us," Very average acting, plot and horror
","Not sure how to share how average everything was...it's a shame to say my favorite part was the use of the music/soundtracks. I went for enjoyment and left with WTF...maybe I'm just a shallow horror movie goer (honestly I don't usually waster time on big screen horror).Anyway, I think if you go in with a more open mind than I perhaps you'll get more from it. But than again, I didn't get much from the Get Up movie either.",5,0,2,28 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Good sendoff for originals..kinda sorta?
","Too much drama; too many brief appearances just to show us everyone is back from dust; not enough action/fighting for such an advertised blockbuster?Enjoyed the unique sendoffs for those core members. Disappointed/sad they will no longer be in future versions (or will they??) But understandable that they were getting older/more expensive to keep around.Ideally, the team will keep Black Panther, Falcon, Scarlett Witch and Vision (at a minimum) or future movies will be watered down/lose luster.",8,0,2,6 May 2019
1917," Very Average War Movie
","Was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed and knew better, sigh....Definitely over-rated as the script & acting wouldn't even make it a good TV movie. The visual effects were above average.",4,0,3,25 February 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Finally, a good remake...
",Definitely worth watching. Storyline differs greatly but just enough to remind you it is a King Kong remake. Very good acting as Samuel L. makes it so very interesting. Ideally they would make a Part 2 for this.,7,2,2,25 September 2019
Wonder Woman," Finally...a DC Winner
","Was pleasantly surprised I enjoyed this film. Great acting, great stunts/special effects and above average script. Liked this much more than Superman vs Batman and maybe better than Superman movies. Definitely see many sequels to this and hope she gets more scenes in future joint movies (i.e. Justice League, etc.) You will get your money worth on this one.",8,3,9,16 June 2017
Green Book," Exceptional story and acting
","Best movie of the year and I've seen in awhile. Not much to find wrong as it had drama, comedy and morality all in one. Didn't remember main actor (Viggo) from previous movies but he was decent; supporting actor Ali continues to impress and show his range as an actor. Could have given it a 10 but since they kept the graphic racist actions that probably occurred to a PG-13 level, I chose to give a 9. PG-13 hopefully makes it a fan favorite for years to come because there is much to learn from this story.",9,3,6,27 February 2019
