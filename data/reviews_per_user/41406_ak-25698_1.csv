It," Took the title IT.... and ran
","I am a big Stephen King book fan. I must say that IT was a huge disappointment. I feel as if the writers simply took the title IT and did whatever they wanted.
There is no real story line. ABSOLUTELY NO backstories on the characters, just an utter mess. So much was left out that I feel it's an injustice for this film to even be called Stephen Kings IT.
Placing the time period in the 80s instead of the 50s REALLY bothers me.
Why this movie has such good ratings is beyond me. I guess we blamed that on the Stranger Things feel.",1,2,8,4 April 2019
