Requiem for a Dream," A punchy movie
","Everyone will not like this movie, but I think it deserves to be seen. Darren Aronofsky shows the descent into hell due to addiction to drugs and even if everything is not perfect the last twenty minutes are so intense, moving as well as disgusting (in a word unique) that this movie has become one of my favorite. For me, the end of the movie is a masterpiece of editing (more for its efficiency than for its artistic quality). I really have been glued to the spot. The music, repetitive but evolutive, strong and heady is perfectly used and played. It is to see movies like these that I keep on going to the cinema, I hope you too.",10,0,0,27 March 2001
