Requiem for a Dream," Best movie I have seen in a while
","This movie absolutely blew me away.  The stunning, gutsy, and flawless performance from Ellen Burstyn was phenomenal.  An Oscar win to her would have been so much more deserving than to give it to Julia Roberts for one of her worst performances.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly have always been favorites of mine and in this movie they proved to me their range of acting. They made me believe the pain that they were going through.  But, back to Ellen Burstyn, she absolutely makes this movie.  One of her greatest performances of her career!!!!",10,0,0,5 May 2001
The Others," Nicole Kidman is great!!
","I absolutely loved this movie.  I first saw the preview for THE OTHERS when I saw MOULIN ROUGE on opening night and knew that I had to see this movie. I absolutely adore Nicole Kidman, and can't wait until THE HOURS with Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore.  Anyway, I have seen it twice so far, and you most likely have to.  After seeing it, and TOTALLY BEING BLOWN AWAY BY THE ENDING!!!! you have to see it again to fully understand it.  One of the best movies I have ever seen!!!",10,0,0,15 November 2001
