Scarface," GOOD movie
","This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made. The rags to riches story of Mr. Montana are in a word...unbelievable. He turned his fortune around seemingly overnight and lets the whole world know about it. The plot is great and Al pacino delivers a performance that is indeed unforgettable. All aspects of an immigrant drug pusher are present...the profanity, the weapons, the violence, the women, the money and the cars. this movie has become so influential to the young audience and it has become a revolutionary hip hop classic. by far one of the best films ever made..definitely a top 10 on any al pacino fan's list.",8,0,2,6 August 2006
