Resident Evil: Afterlife," Loved this Movie. Best 3D ever! Tiny Spoiler.
",Let me begin with I am a fan of both the games and movies. I do not have a problem with them not being the same. With that said this movie is so freaking awesome the 3D is the same as Avatar and it is done very well. Three major fight scenes and new added players from the video game series is cool. The whole movie is great in 3D but the fight scenes will blow you away. The Executioner 'AXE MAN' is wild. I love all the main players in this movie. Milla is great again. Ali Larter is a true fighter now. Wesker is a perfect evil villain. Couple moments it gets a little slow but hang on when it picks up. You will be startled a couple times with the Zombies. Do not leave your seat when the credits start rolling...wait about 30 to 40 seconds for a surprise! I am so stoked for another one..lets hope this movie will make enough money so we can get Resident Evil:Regeneration. Go and enjoy this wild 3D ride and have fun. Special effects monster of a film. Alice has always Rocked and now so does Claire. Great...Great...Great Movie. Do not listen to the haters.,8,9,20,12 September 2010
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Wat too much violence.
","The Penguins are the only constantly funny part of the movie. The first movie was better. I hope it ends with this one. My kids hardly even cracked a smile except for the Penguins. So do you think it will fly? Well captain if fold it like this and like this and throw it in the trash. The old women and Alex fighting was too much. I know it helped lead up to the ending, But my 8 year old son said daddy I did not think a man was supposed to hit a women, but I guess when your short on humor you have to shock people. Whats next Madagascar 3:Escape from Alkatraz. Stick with the first movie and wait for Ice Age 3 or maybe someday Toy Story 3.",4,6,14,12 November 2008
The Princess Bride," Fantastic entertainment!
",This is one of my all time favorite films. Nothing short of a classic love adventure. This movie needs to be seen by everyone. Every part was cast to perfection even Andre The Giant. Who is amazing in this movie considering he was a professional wrestler. Mandy Patinkin is my favorite actor in this movie. Who plays Enego Montoya in which avenging his fathers death is a relentless pursuit of the six fingered man. Just plain fun and entertaining. Sit back and enjoy the love of woman drive a man to endless pursuit of Princess Buttercup. Clever writing and fantastic filming of this classic should be seen and heard from everyone who loves movies.,10,0,1,30 December 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Awesome movie but enough with the sexual theme..We get it..OK.
","Great movie...Visual masterpiece of digital overload. Please if they make a third one. Megan Fox is sexy and pretty, but we do not need that much sexual themes. Hey look Megans butt, Megan laying in someone crotch, Megans boobs again and as for the other skank in the movie 'THE DECEPTIHOOKER' This movie series can live on without all of the sex themes. Megan fox knows she is pretty and we do to but her character is fun enough with jeans and a t-shirt. When they resurrect Optimus and the fight with the Fallen happens. Its better than a Rocky movie. It has been a long time since I wanted a bad guy to get his rear end kicked. I just wish they would have tied up the end a little better. 2 hours and 30 minutes flew by. So another 10 minutes would not have hurt. Overall just a awesome movie to watch. I am ready for #3 with out the sex. Thank You.",6,1,5,15 August 2009
