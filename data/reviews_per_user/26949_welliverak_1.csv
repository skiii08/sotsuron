Hereditary," Worst film I've seen in theaters
","A poorly executed plot I've seen a dozen times. The jump-scares are laughable and the acting is woefully unrealistic.I LOVE scary movies, and honestly I frequently set my bar fairly low. I wasn't expecting this movie to be earth shattering but I certainly wasn't expecting to be bored to pieces for two hours or to laugh out loud at the film's climax.I wasted two hours of my life on this movie. Don't be me.",1,2,6,26 June 2018
