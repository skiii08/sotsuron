Black Swan," Previews VERY misleading and disappointed
","I heard about this movie thru a friend and heard fantastic reviews from her friends. The previews looked like just my type of movie, in fact. My boyfriend and I and some friends went to see this movie last night, and I was highly disturbed and very disappointed. The movie has a huge overload of sexual content that is very explicit and unnecessary. I'm not an ultra-conservative movie-goer but it was almost embarrassing to watch with my boyfriend--to the point that I walked out of the theater halfway through. I thought Natalie Portman had more class than this...there are plenty of other ways to express one's 'dark-side' besides redundant sexual scenes. 2 thumbs down!",1,37,103,21 December 2010
