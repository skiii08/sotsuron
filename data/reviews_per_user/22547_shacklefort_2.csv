The Avengers," As Amazing As Any Movie Ever Made!
","In keeping with Marvel's best efforts, Joss Whedon sets this movie apart from every other standard adventure movie, by the way he communicates the overall experience. We live the story and we feel the intensity and gravity of every situation. We fully embrace the characters as we go along on this amazing ride. It's so wonderful that we got to know each of the major players in their own solo movie(s) before this adventure. That just adds a ton to the depth. This movie isn't about comic book pulp or things that go 'boom' but about a powerful, exciting and meaningful story. The elements are fantastical but perfectly balanced by the characters and the way Whedon grounds everything.Visual and emotional imagery are presented throughout the movie and provides the viewer with greater insight into the heroes AND even the villain. Everything here screams quality and screams fun all the way through. Yes, despite the depth and serious consequences there is a great deal of fun. That's something I'm so grateful that Marvel usually delivers. For those going into this flick expecting a lot of fun, prepare to enjoy. But remember, fun is not the only piece of this pie. In fact, I think most movie fans will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers upon.This is a smart and surprisingly deep film that really delivers on everything promised in all those teaser set-ups from other Marvel films.",Null,1,4,27 July 2012
Spider-Man 2," Ebert is right... best of 2004 and best of genera!
","I'm glad to see this amazing film back in the top 250 movies of all-time here at IMDb. Credit the drop to a jealous frenzy of fools who voted it 1 out of 10 because of some strange agenda. I'm glad the true rating is gradually sliding back to where it belongs. I agree with Roger Ebert who states that this is the best film of this genera and I also agree with him when he states that it should've been nominated by the academy for best picture of 2004.Even in an era when an explosion of comic-book superheroes is hitting the silver screen, Spider-Man stands alone. You must own this flick! It's tight, emotional, lean and superbly done and I enjoyed it even more on the small screen because the extras were fascinating and very well done.",Null,1,3,25 February 2005
