Hereditary," This starts well, but eventually disappoints
","'If you ever want to sleep again, then stay away,' said a review of this movie. Perfect for someone who likes horror movies like me, I thought.
The film starts well, with the cast crew perfect. The film's depiction of a serious dysfunctional family is good and scary enough. The action deals more about what is not said and done, than what we actually see. And here I think the movie works well the first hour. When the angle is then pulled into the occult, with scenes and sounds, it also works well in the beginning. But then I dropped off. The last part of the film turns out to be crazy for me, with effects that we are familiar with from horror movies, but I think the film takes a direction that I see was unable to cope with. I experienced that there were more people who went from the show and, even though I sat down, I did not get involved anymore. And I actually began to feel bored and disapointed. Unlike A Quiet Place who managed to keep the excitement and suspense all the way to the end, Hereditary becomes a movie that I think traces from a psychological and exciting start to an end where the crashing effects are in line and the solutions become too banal.",6,1,2,16 July 2018
Passengers," Haunting and beautiful
","I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future.",8,212,255,16 May 2017
The Babadook," Better as a drama, than a scary movie
","I had big expectations when I went to see this film. The reviews are great, and it has went down well at the box Office around the world too.But, It did not live up to my expectations. First of all, I found it not scary enough. It should make you jump once in a while, but it doesn't.I also have problems With the plot and the story. A young, distressed mother tries to cope with her demanding and somehow disturbed young son. They have a struggle in they're daily life. The mother soon finds she is suffering from insomnia, and seems to becoming seriously mentally ill, totally worn out as she is. Meanhvile her son has made contact with a scary creature called The Babadook. This part of the film actually works fine. The actors portray this struggle convincing and we sees to be watching a psychological drama, with people who are living on the edge.But, when the Babadook appears it somehow does not work for me. The scary monster is somehow misplaced into this story, and I did not like the special effects, which seems outdated. This film wants too much for it,s own good. I found therefore it not to be a very good scary film.I have seldom been in at the cinema during this sort of film, only to discover that the audience chat, and laugh at the wrong places. I think the mainly young audience did not expect the melodrama that takes place here.But the acting is really strong, the scars are not. It you expect a new film like Sinister, you will be let down.",6,4,8,7 November 2015
Us," Creepy and surprising
","A good horrormovie is seldom these days. Most of the stuff that comes out, are not worth your time or money. This movie is an absolute exception. Yes, I know it is not perfect, unlogical and at times a bit confusing. But the plot is good. The actors are also up to the challenge, and I enjoyed it.
The horror is here all along, with many creepy scenes. The film has some good surprises too that will keep you on the alert. If you are going to see it, please avoid spoilers. This is a film you should see without knowing too much about it. Looking forward to the next one from this director.",8,0,2,16 September 2019
Alien," The Masterpiece
","After seeing the Alien Covenant and becoming quite disappointed, Alien was set up at the Filmens House in Oslo.(an independent film house) The timing could not be better than a reminder of the Alien masterpiece. I had to go. The movie that started this series of films.Iam glad to find out that the film has not really lost anything, considering it came out in 1979. Why is it so good? In my opinion, it has everything that a top horror movie should have. 1. The actors are brilliantly cast and portray different reactions and behaviors when people are put under pressure and exposed to the worst imaginable strains. Anxiety, unrest, anger - played out. Friendship and cooperation are put to the test. 2. The story is carefully built up. Here are no big action scenes, or spectacular stunts. Only the story-line that is so well portrayed and the anxiety we, the audience feel too, when we watch the movie. 3) The film is undoubtedly groundbreaking, with her female heroine taking on the role of leader under strong pressure. I once read that Alfred Hitcock had said that: The audience likes to be scared. It fits very well and is probably the explanation that this movie has become a classic. For all young people who have not seen it, see it!!. And ask their local movie club to set it up at the cinema, so you'll see how a movie masterpiece is and experience watching a top horror movie, which you'll won't soon forget.",10,1,2,20 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The emperor strikes back!
","So many negative reviews here and in the newspapers. Understand it who can! This is a good Stars Wars movie, although the most spectacular fight scenes are missing. This movie has something that the latter have been missing; Emperor Palpatime. A wonderful return! I've missed him in the latest movies. Why not bring him back? He belongs in the Star Wars universe! I have missed the emperor, because he is the ultimate villain. This helps in the story, and makes the fronts so clear. Here he is absolutely central again, and as always has the plans ready. I actually think they have manage to bring him back in a credible way. And he does not disappoint this time either, the closing fight is wonderful. So I do not join the hymn of those who do not like this. I enjoyed going to the cinema when I saw it, and mean those who made it have done a good job.",7,3,12,30 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Tries to hard to grasp too much
","It's hard to make good biographically movies. Especially on famous people like Freddie Mercury. An icon, one of the greatest pop singers ever. With a copious career. This movie is well-liked by many, but I did not fall for it. I think the movie tries to embrace too much. Is it about Mercury? About Queen? Mercurys career? Or the privacy of Mercury? A bit of everything, it seemed. There are good roles performances by the main role-holder, especially I think he is good at the last part of the film.
But after reading several (admittedly unauthorized) biographies by Freddie Mercury, I think the movie does not seem to give any good insight into who he was private, his relationship with other and sexual orientation. The movie takes light of who he was private and unable to go into the depths of life he lived. It is too smooth for me. Mayby to make it more acceptable for a big audience? His career and the story of Queen is well presented here. But quitting the movie with the entire sequence of the band during LIVE AID becomes strange. Then I'll rather see the performance of the real band on youtube.",6,2,6,11 December 2018
The Revenant," Strong, but too brutal for my taste
","Most are already written by reviews of this movie here. Most words are already used, and many good reviews as well. Therefore will I do this review short about what I experienced as negative with this in many ways very great movie. The story is good and the action is intense. Lenoardo Di Caprio make an amazing effort. My objection to this movie is the brutality. For my part, it was all too much violence and brutality. This violence lasts throughout the film, and makes one gets tired of watching it. I think that this story fine could have managed without the explicit violence scene, even the famous scene with the bear that attack. That makes this movie difficult to watch, and I think that it may be too violent for many. There is not anyone who can stand or withstand to see such things, and this review is therefore a reminder to these, and the film should be considered carefully. Beyond that'll probably be many awards at this forward, and it will maybe be considered a classic in the years to come. The environment this film takes place is in is beautiful filmed. But the film had been just as good without the blood and the brutality.",7,1,3,28 February 2016
Dunkirk," I want to see it again...
","I only regret that I did not see Dunkirk when it was shown at the cinema. And not home on television. Either way, it was a strong experience.
I never think I've seen a movie that so much imparts a mood, a mood of despair, hope, camaraderie, heroism, but first and foremost, the film masterfully masters the dark thrill that unfolds in Dunkirk and all those involved. The strength of the film is that it manages to convey the human stresses it must have been part of in such operations during the Second World War.
I have nothing negative to adress about this movie. The rolling crew is amazing. The film depicts different fates, and everything is merged to the end.
This is a movie that can also be recommended to those who do not like the genre 'war movies', as it is the psychological stresses and experiences that are conveyed, and not endless war scenes. Recommended.",10,1,3,28 December 2017
Aliens," You can't get a better horror movie than this one
","After the brilliant Alien from 1979, it took 7 years for this sequel to be released. But it was really worth the wait. My opinion is that this is one of few examples where the sequel is better then the original. And Alien was also excellent. Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the only one who survived the encounter with the deadly alien in Alien - the eighth passenger '. In the sequel 'Aliens' Ripley is back to the planet where she first met the monsters. Here she discovers that the beast is alive and well and has offspring too. The offspring are at least as dangerous as the original monster, and Ripley have to really take control and lead the battle once again, to fight back and try to survive the vicious attack. This time with soldiers and one child, a surviver they find on the planet.The brilliant Sigourney Weaver takes on the monsters in a breathtaking speed and with a determination that will keep Your attention during the film.The haunting and battle scenes are amazing, and the struggle to defeat the monsters are the most exciting in the film. But the casting are also very good. I think the storyline and casting of this film, is stronger and better than in the sequels that followed.This is really creepy, and so well done. A true masterpiece that will continue to entertain and scare movie lovers for a long, long time.",10,1,2,31 December 2015
The Conjuring 2," Creepy and classic horror
","Very briefly summarized: old-fashioned and good horror movie. I might also add that this sequel is just as good as its predecessor. But there is a but. The film begins very well. Mother and children in a house where it happens scary stuff. Many well-used but effective effects makes you cringe properly several times. Just like we will have a good horror movie. I also think it is a good choice to move the story from the US to London. It breaks well with the first film. Unfortunately, I think the last part of the film is not as good, unfortunately. The story is too complicated, and horror effects become too exaggerated, in my opinion. I also think the end, the settlement with evil was something strange. But this film is not bad in any way. I only wish it would hold the suspense up all along. Nevertheless this is one of the better ones in its genre, and it will probably continue to entertain fans of such movies. So we'll see what happens on the third film? I guess there will be several films to follow.",6,0,0,24 October 2016
Get Out," scary is only the first name.....
","Finally. Finally, a good horror movie. It is far between, but Get Out can warmly recommended if you like both good movie, and an eerie and thrilling experience.I will not divulge any of the action. Read minimum possible about the plot before you see it. But what I can write is that the film has an action that builds long plot up, and giving the audience hints along the way. The film also features traditional elements of horror, which causes one to sprinkle. But some of the best of the film is the combination unconventional action, in combination with good horror effects.The actors were unknown to me at the forefront, but the convicts to the fullest. Enjoy also the raw end. For this is a film that delivers until it is finished!This is a warm recommendation!",8,8,16,16 April 2017
Call Me by Your Name," Beautiful story about gay love under the Italian sun
","This movie has gotten very good reviews, and I was excited when I saw it during a film festival in Oslo, even opening film. The story takes place in Italy in 1983. A wealthy Italian family receives an American male researcher who will live with them for 6 weeks. The meeting between him and the family's teenage son is the foundation of the story in this film. The film depicts the tension between the two, which eventually evolve into a close friendship. A friendship that evolves into a sexual relationship. The film is beautifully portrayed. The two men unfold in a beautiful landscape. But film is slow and briefly depicts how the contact between the two evolves. In my opinion, the film could be have shorter, and would have benefited on that. It's a too slow and somewhat tedious. The film's content is also not very new, but it's beautifully filmed. It also reflects on a theme that shows that we are not going back so many years back before gay relationships were taboo and that such love had to be hidden. In addition, this is also about an adult man initiating a relationship with a teenage boy. There is solid craftsmanship in both filming, acting and role- playing. But the direction could have been tighter, in my opinion, and the film is too long. But I still enjoyed seeing it.",7,8,32,20 September 2017
Evil Dead," Just silly. Don't waste your time or money
","It seems that the reviews to this one are either top-notch or completely bane. I gave it a shot. But unfortunately, this is just incredibly bad.
First, the storyline is not credible. Why iwould these young people travel together? It does not show that they like each other either in the first place. And then they'll be together on a hut in the wasteland. Strange. The beginning of the film made me think this is crap. When the scary things begins to happen, they characters act so stupid that it is almost comical. Not logical in a thin, thin story that makes no sense. A better script would probably have been useful.
No, this is far from good enough for me. I turned it off after about one hour...",3,1,1,27 April 2018
Silence," Could have been great - ends up as tedious and boring
","This movie was nothing for me. Basically an exciting story, a great director and talented actors. What makes it not good? I had major problems with this 'narrator voice' that goes through throughout the film. It is tiresome and makes it difficult to get into the movie properly. It's getting tiresome to hear, and this narrator also has a pompous language that makes it a little exciting. I think the movie fails to find a nerve that makes it good. Excitingly, it will not be. The film is also very categorical and portray for example Japanese as very one-dimensional. Last but not least, I think it's tedious. The positive thing about the film is the filming of nature and use of photo in general. It is beautiful to watch. But it's not enough to save this project for my part.",4,3,5,24 May 2017
Midsommar," Well done in many ways, but too tedious and weird.
","Midsummer is the period that is centered on the summer solstice, and more specifically the Northern European celebrations that accompany the solstice itself or take place on a day between June 19 and June 25. In both Norway, and especially Sweden, these are great markings that mean a lot to many. A big party everyone is looking forward to, marking the brightest time of the year. So it is inventive to make a movie about this theme and try to make a creepy twist on it. And the film is in many ways well executed, well filmed, beautiful surroundings and costumes. But it fails. There are many reasons why I couldn't let myself get carried away. I think it was involuntarily comical, and that's not the point? This is supposed to be a scary thing, but it is far too long and tedious. It also lacks an understanding of why all the Swedish members do as they do, and the background to the horrific traditions we witness. But the biggest puzzle for me; why in the world does anyone dare to seek something like that and stay there? No.",5,0,1,19 November 2019
Don't Breathe," Don't hold your breath - this is not a good horror film
","This film, I had expectations. Especially on the basis of descriptions. I'm constantly searching for good horror movies, but they are sparse. There are few new ones that can measure up to the good old classics, such as The Shining. But here's mention good. It has high scores, and much praise. I gave Do not Breathe a chance tonight. And was very disappointed. There are three reasons for that. 1) The story is little original. We have seen this before. The characters have no personality or attractiveness to us who see the movie. We get no sympathy for them. 2) The action is so predictable that it almost is not to persevere. 3) An amazing little catchy ending. But it opens well for a sequel maybe? Let us hope that after this crash, comes the silence. The best thing I can write is that it is not very long and that there is a lot along the way. But do not expect to jump in his chair with fright. The film will surprise very little.",3,0,4,10 February 2017
Arrival," Thorough and thoughtful
","Expert on language Louise Banks (Amy Adams) retrieved by the authorities after a number of extraterrestrial craft lands around the Earth. Creatures are trying to communicate something, but nobody understands what. Louise must try to find out if they are peaceful or hostile before time runs out. Just time is important in this movie, and if you are looking for lots of action, this is not the movie for you. The film is careful and slow. Amy Adams is good as it somewhat strange and pensive language expert, who must cope with a major challenge. The film's strength is in my opinion a new twist in this genre. The weakness is that it sometimes becomes somewhat tedious. We would like something to happen. There is also a minus that in this film also pulled into the military engaging in an boring manner. The film has a strong and surprise ending. But overall this is a good sci-fi drama, and well worth seeing.",8,0,5,20 March 2017
The Woman in Black," Average horror
","This movie is very medium, with the exception of Dan Radcliffe who plays the lead role. He makes the most of playing the grief-stricken lawyer who takes on the task of figuring out supernatural events related to a house. The film certainly has great horror experiences, but here's nothing we haven't seen before. The action is also very predictable, with the exception of the somewhat surprising ending. But I like to see more of Dan in such movies, but he has to face some bigger challenges than this one.",5,0,1,26 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Very good - but the best is yet to come
","As a lot of you guys I grew up with Star Wars. What would the world have been without these great films and characters? I dare not to think of it.After a hiatus for almost 10 years, the adventure is back on the big screen. Let me start off with what I thought was very good:1. The new stars, Adam Driver as the evil Kylo Renn, Daisey Ridley as the new female hero and John Boyega as Finn - they are really, really good. They work very well together. In The Force Awakens we got them introduced in an exciting way. 2. The storyline is thrilling, a lot of action scenes, with locations and settings that takes you back to the days of A New Hope. J.J. Abrams has really been true to the basics of the original films, which I am truly happy for. I think this is one of the main reasons of the popularity of the film too. I only disliked one thing about this movie, and his name is Spoke. The new emperor? No, I don't think so. He looks like something out of Lord Of The Rings. Good that we did not see much of him.I think the best is yet to come. This film really lays out some many great opportunities for the sequels. I just can't way.",8,3,23,20 December 2015
Munich," One of the best from Spielberg
","This Steven Spielberg movie tells a haunting and compelling story, based on a terrorist attack during the Olympic Games in Munich. Spielberg manages to tell a story about violence, who eventually takes a brutal turn of those who gets involved. You don't have to be interested in politics to watch this movie, but it can be an advantage. The casting is good, but I have to say, that this is Eric Banas movie.What a performance! He portraits the main character with wisdom, depth and is really convincing. This is also a film you may recommend to friends who like a real compelling story in films,and like films with a important message. I highly recommend it. But don't watch it with people who likes to chat, and interfere during showing. This film deserves to be watched carefully and without interruptions of any kind.",10,2,2,6 July 2015
Life," Very average - don't believe the hype
","The genre of Life is my favorite, with Aliens films as absolute highlight. The trailer for Life and the discussion reminded me of a new great experience. But I was disappointed. A research crew of six members of an international space station is assigned to study an organism from Mars. Happiness is absolute when they find a living organism. This is eventually named Calvin. But the joy turns to fear when the creature turns out to be a brutal killer and have a strong survival instinct. Does this sound familiar?This sci-fi thriller has very strong names like Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson and Jake Gyllenhaal. Ryan Reynolds role, however, is very insignificant. The best is Jake Gyllenhaal who manages to convey the horror. The problem with the film, I think that it is not exciting enough, it is not nasty enough and I have problems with the monster too. There is something strange about it all. The film is quite OK, but nothing more. The ending opens up for sequels. Well, I won't be waiting for those. I hope I rather have a good experience in May, when the new Aliens movie will be ready for release.",5,9,19,26 March 2017
The Pursuit of Happyness," Keep The Faith!
","This story will touch you, if you like a good drama. I can guarantee it. Will play Chris Gardner, a poor and unsuccessful guy in San Francisco. His wife leaves him and he is alone with his son Christopher. He decides to be a stockbroker. He must go through a demanding course, where only one of the participants will be offered the job. Meanwhile, he must cope with a steadily deteriorating cash situation that could lead to him and his son are homeless. The story is based on a real story. This is a heartfelt story about holding on to your dreams and never ever give up. Life is what you make it. Whatever problems life throws in his face, he gets up and does not give up. It's hard not to feel sympathy for Chris, well played by Will Smith. One of his best performances in a film. He should do more of these kinds of films, instead of wasting his talent in films like After Earth. What is happiness? In this film, it is intended that happiness is money and a well paid job. But I think this gripping film is really about courage and not let go of the dream of a better life. This is one of my favorite movies, for great performances for Smith Jr. and Snr., great storytelling and it has a strong, important message. A film you can watch several times, alone or with friends. Recommended.",10,1,2,14 March 2016
Sully," Not perfect, but a good drama from director Eastwood
","Basically, I'm skeptical of such films. Filming of actual events, like Sully is about. The film is about Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who managed to land a plane in the Hudson River. But I gave it a shot. This is a low-key film, and the events are not made in chronological order. But this actually makes the film work better than expected. Clint Eastwood uses good actors like Tom Hanks, to tell the story from different angles. Tom Hanks manages to give Hero Sully depth and insight on several levels. Including how it is to suddenly come into focus for the whole world. I thought the film was a little unexciting the first half hour, but Eastwood manages to tell this story thoroughly. And the film picked up and I was engaged by it. Do not expect great action scenes, the film the film is actually a good drama about a man and his great accomplishment.",7,1,2,16 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," Good horror - but far from the best
","I'm a big fan of this genre and these movies. The expectations were therefore great before I went into the movie theater to see what Ridley Scott has done now. This is an Alien movie that does not shame on its predecessors. But it is far from the best in this series. (I do not include Aliens vs Predator!) It is also much more exciting than Prometeous. So why am I a little disappointed? I've been thinking a lot after I saw this movie. First of all, what's positive, the film has some benefits from all the technical possibilities that exist now, which did not exist in 1979. This draws the film benefits, especially in the action scene and how the monster is. What I miss here, as opposed to Alien and Aliens, is the mediation of anxiety we all felt when we say these movies. What happens now? Where does the monster pop up next time? Here it is more linear and action-oriented. And more hunting scenes. I think the movie loses on it. It is the claustrophobic, fearful predecessors who made the films so creepy and unpredictable. Here it is more obvious what will happen. Moore blood yes, but I was much more scared when I saw Alien.I want to draw out actress Katherine Waterston as a big plus in the movie. She is very good and carries a lot of the film.I really hope that Sigourney Weaver will appear next time, in a brand new follow up to the brilliant Aliens.",6,6,16,29 May 2017
