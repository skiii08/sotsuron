Skyfall," Disappointing...
","I saw this movie on the second day of it's release, which was very disappointing at that time, 'cause I wanted to see it on the first day itself. I'm a hardcore Bond fan with a personal collection of all Bond films. Which makes me question ... Is 'Skyfall' a Bond movie? The essential ingredients of any Bond movie include buzzing action scenes, sinister plots, twists and turns, beautiful women, passionate sex, unbelievable gizmo's and death defying stunts. Where are all these in 'Skyfall'? Apart from an opening trademark action Train sequence, which failed to raise the adrenaline, the story is just an action thriller... Could have been a Van Damme movie actually. Do we want to see the human, vulnerable side of Bond? Bond is a killer ... cool, calculating, ruthless, almost inhuman. So when Skyfall showcases a weak Bond, i can only sit and protest. How did this man become human? That's not 007 for me. And lastly the movie is Dark...too dark for a Bond movie. Had it been any other action thriller i would have given it a 8.5.",5,1,6,4 November 2012
