Lucky Number Slevin," Horrible. Absolutely Insulting.
","This film is crammed with too much hipster language. Perhaps it's being used as a device to camouflage a very poor film. It's trying so hard to be witty and funny, but fails miserably. The sex and violence were very graphic and not in an artistic way. It certainly didn't help the story and just seemed to be stuffed in everywhere to fill plot holes.Lucy Lu needs an acting lesson and the script was written by someone who must have just read the book 'Writing Monologues for Dummies.' How someone could enjoy this film is beyond me. If there was a sequel to Pulp Fiction that was made by a third-rate writer and director with ADHD, Slevin is what would have been produced.I'm not going into the boring and predictable plot here. I'm just going to highlight two points.1) Any film where the characters start quoting/summarizing plots from classic films is trying to ride on the coat tales of greatness. In this mediocre film, Slevin (the main character) compares his life to Jimmy Stewart in Hitchcock's North by Northwest in a long, stupid monologue.2) Have you ever seen The Simpson's episode where Lisa discovers she's a vegetarian and insists on a veggie meal in the cafeteria? To squash her opinion, the school shows a Troy McClure video that promotes eating meat and claims that anyone who is a vegetarian is a moron. Lisa exclaims at the end of the film 'Are you really going to swallow this tripe?' to the other students. The teacher responds by asking the student to help themselves to some tripe that was donated by the meat council. This class digs in.Considering the high ratings on IMDb, I suppose a lot of people swallow this tripe. It's sad. Very very sad....",1,22,48,9 October 2006
Constantine," Blade with Demons Instead of Vampires
","My title pretty much sums it up.Plot summary: Demons are trying to dominate the earth and a chosen one must stop them. (Replace Demons with Vampires, Nazis, Aliens, Spiders, Egg Beaters or whatever your whim and that will cover about 75% of these kinds of horror movies).Here are the highlights and lowlights:-The Devil was a great, sleazy, personification of a swindling, lounge lizard. One of the best devil depictions in film that I've seen.-Decent special effects -Predictable storyline -Fine for a matin√©e, but I wouldn't pay full price -I've seen worse -Major plot inconsistency: If Angela could tune out the ghosts as a child, couldn't she do that again as an adult? -Some super-fancy gadgets -One of the characters is a black-market, religious weapons dealer who collects those moo-cow toys. He's interesting and the priest that hears the damned is interesting, but more time should have been taken with character developmentIf you're looking for a scary, Satan-taking-over-the-earth film, I suggest The Omen, Damien Omen II or The Prophecy.",5,1,21,19 February 2005
Spider-Man 3," Dawson's Creek Meets Elektra...
","...with a little Xanadu sprinkled in for good measure. The producers of these must have had something to do with the production of Spidey 3 (I'll explain these comparisons in my review). I dislike spoilers and think the best way to properly review this movie without giving it away is to compare it to other films and TV shows.I stopped guessing who was going to be caught kissing whom by the end and I just didn't care anymore. I went into Spidey 3 not expecting it to be as good as 1 & 2 (I had read other reviews), but good lord! It was like someone p*ssed on the iconic scenes from the first two movies. Shame on whoever came up with this mess.I don't mind complex characters. In fact I enjoy them, but it was like Dr. Phil was involved and wanted to show the tortured, tender sides of the villains, while Spidey is shown as no saint. Spidey 3 had the same problem I had with Elektra, I didn't know who to cheer for, and to top it off, Elektra had a better script. I'm serious. I'm not exaggerating. It was like the producers of Spidey 3 came up with all these great fight scenes and musical numbers first, and then realized they should have some kind of story to tie it all to together. The logic and motivations of the supposed 'good guys' are completely off (even if they are being influenced by evil). The only truly good person is Aunt Mae, who randomly bursts onto the screen to offer pearls of wisdom akin to Yoda guiding a young Luke Skywalker.To top it off, the heroes are just plain stupid in the heart-to-heart dramatic scenes (don't worry, I won't spoil the heartbreaking moments). Just watch an episode of Dawson's Creek and that will give you a good example. The audience was actually booing and someone sitting behind me called MJ a b***h.The dialog was on the level of the junior high school kids in an after school special. It was obviously written by someone who'd never actually stepped into a college classroom. Peter Parker even gets picked on for being a nerd in a college-level physics class by a jock throwing spit balls at his head and another shining a mirror in his eyes while he's trying to read the chalkboard.I won't go into the massacre of the Gwen Stacey character (Peter's lab partner).There are some continuity problems which can jerk a watcher out of the moment which are quite annoying (my brain would go 'wait a minute' when the poor editing would change what a character was doing in mid-sentence).The only reason I suggest seeing this on the big screen is for the special effects. They're pretty amazing. The Sandman is quite breathtaking.See Spidey 3 if you must, but expect a huge spectacle like Xanadu with flashy numbers and thin dialog in the middle. You've been warned.",4,1,3,5 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," I'd Rather Get Eaten by Zombies Than Watch This Movie Again
","I got dragged to this stinker by 5 friends. I can tell you right now that at least 6 people walked out in the middle because Resident Evil: Extinction was so bad.If you enjoy hicks attempting to rape a fully clothed Milla (there's no nudity), you may enjoy this film, but I'll warn you, this is the only plot point that makes any sense.To sum up, scientists decide to make zombies more intelligent. According to their reasoning, smart zombies won't crave flesh anymore and can then be used as a slave workforce.My boyfriend and I were the first to leave. I just wanted to go to our car and get out of there, but my boyfriend insisted that we deserved a refund for this atrocity. We found the manager and said we wanted our money back. The manager didn't even ask for a reason and seemed unsurprised. He quickly accommodated us. If you find yourself in a bad film, keep your ticket stub. You have the right to not have to waste your money or time on lousy films.About a half hour later I got a call from my boyfriend's brother. Our other friend's had walked out too and got a refund. He said the movie just kept getting worse with Milla putting out fires with her mind.Ultraviolet was better and made more sense (don't mistake that for an endorsement, Ultraviolet was very hard to sit through)",1,9,18,25 September 2007
The Prestige," Better Than Most Current Movies in Theaters, but Ultimately Disappointing (no spoilers)
","The Prestige has a lot of good things going for it. Great acting, a top-notch cast, interesting characters, beautiful scenery and gorgeous costumes. The film takes place in the late-Victorian period just as science is about to advance by leaps and bounds. Understanding, harnessing and manipulating electricity is the new and exciting craze. Add in two rivaling magicians who want to top each other's best act and the stage is set for what I hoped would be a gripping story. Piper Perabo was the most likable character and wish she had more screen time. There's also a sci/fi twist that is quite interesting too. All kinds of good things to make a great film.But...There are several ways that The Prestige didn't work for me. It has huge plot holes and continuity problems. Upon further analysis after the film, the logic was just plain sloppy. These issues should have been addressed and rewritten prior to filming. It really ruined the magic of the film.The pacing is uneven. Most of the time it's very slow (slower than Masterpiece Theater). If I had been watching the film on TV, I wouldn't have made it all the way through, but I was in the theater so it kept my attention span.The ending though interesting, was very disappointing. The film turned into a second-rate, M. Shymalan script for the last half hour. People in the theater were laughing after the end monologue because it sounded heavy-handed and ridiculous.Even though the actors did a good job, the range of each character was quite small. There was no depth. Jackman was obsessive, Caine was the all-knowing sage, Bowie was the mysterious scientist, Johansson was the slut, and all the rest. You get the idea. The lack of growth in the character development made the story boring and stale. I just didn't find myself caring for what happened to any of them by the end.The Prestige is actually a rather dark film. Much sadder and than I expected. It is not a feel good film. I would have been fine with the darkness if the plot didn't have so many holes in it. I usually enjoy a good mystery or thriller, but found the twists to be rather predictable.A quick warning for animal lovers: there's some animal cruelty. It's not as horrible as The Brothers Grimm, but it's something to be aware of if you are going to take a child to see the film or are sensitive about those things.If you aren't into analyzing films and don't care about it making sense, you'll probably enjoy the film. I was fine with the sci/fi aspect of The Prestige, it's the plot that has the problems. Some of the twists work and some are just silly and sloppy writing.I sincerely wanted to enjoy this film, but it wasn't as dazzling as I had hoped it would be. I wanted it to be a 10, but the most I can give it is 7.",4,1,4,27 November 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," I Have No Stomach for Gore and I LOVED Pan's Labyrinth
","Let me stress, this is not a film for children. It's more in the old-fashioned story-telling vain with true villains, tests of courage, and lot's of harsh lessons. It's like the version of Cinderella where her step-sister cuts off her toe to fit into the glass slipper (and you actually see the toe being removed).I wanted to address the gore in the film. Yes, the violence is harsh, but it's only on the screen for about 5 minutes out of the entire film. You can also tell when it's going to happen. The scene will build up to it. The visuals won't just cut to something gory then explain it later (like The Ring, which I had to walk out of because it was too graphic and scary). I had plenty of time to cover my eyes.From the other reviews I've read, I thought I was going to be bombarded by gore and violence, but this was not the case. The story starts at a mellow pace with pleasant imagery. It really captures the wonder and innocence of a child being introduced to a cruel and strange world (both real and fantasy). There is a definite Alice and Wonderland feel to the film, but it quickly spirals to something much darker than the Disney version. Pan's Labyrinth is two stories in one. There's the harsh reality of war versus a fantastical world based on myth and fairy tales. This film is what other films have been so desperately trying to be, but otherwise failing (The Brother's Grimm comes to mind).I love mythical, parable-type films and Pan's Labyrinth does a great job with wonderful story-telling, excellent acting, great character development, fine editing...the list goes on and on. Also, the CG is understated and beautiful.",10,5,12,8 January 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Worth Watching Just to See the Ending
","I saw this with a group of friends who didn't know much about the film. After about 30 minutes, one of them commented, 'Is this suppose to be a comedy?' That's pretty much the feeling for the first half of the film, but once the characters are established, the viewer is set up for one of the most charming displays of a family bonding ever in a film.The family is extremely messed up. It felt like we were visiting a home where we were seeing things that we shouldn't be seeing. It was painful and compelling at the same time because you could tell that everyone cared for each other very much but all their personal S**t was getting in the way of them making healthy connections to each other.The youngest of the family, 8 year-old Olive, gets into a beauty contest and the whole family embarks on a trip across country in a decrepit Microbus to support her dream of being Little Miss Sunshine. Olive is adorable, but not cutesy at all. Her father is so hard on her to be a winner that he even starts getting her to hate her body and be thin so she can become a beauty queen. Olive isn't fat at all. She looks like a normal kid. This isn't light humor, but biting commentary about society.The middle part of the film is a bit like the movie 'Vacation.' Unfortunately, there are some plot problems that couldn't be ignored so I took away a star.Once the family reaches The Little Miss Sunshine Pagant, be ready to be hit over the head with some of the funniest comedy I've seen in a long time. My friend who first asked, 'Is this a comedy?' couldn't stop laughing.I felt like we had listened to the details of a very long joke and were finally given the punchline.",9,1,2,26 January 2007
Spirited Away," Still a Classic
","Fun characters, interesting story, top-notch animation, and excellent music are just some of the highlights.If you enjoy whimsical fantasy, run to rent this film. It's not just for children.It was so nice to see a good, fantasy animation. I actually watched Spirited Away twice in the theater. The first time was with subtitles. I enjoyed it so much, I took some of my friends to see it a second time. This time I saw the English-dubbed version. I sat back and caught much more than the first time. I couldn't believe how much I missed without the dub. I could also get more emotionally involved and feel more connected to the film. The voice-acting was excellent.I just saw Princess Mononoke which got me thinking about Spirited Away. I was told that they were made by the same people. Although they are both good films, I would say Spirited Away is better over all.",10,2,3,28 December 2006
The Illusionist," Magically Beautiful and Romantic
","Films like these are why I go to the movies. The Illusionist is a lovely fantasy with lots of magic tricks. It plays on the mythical theme of forbidden love and sets the stage in Victorian Europe.There's some creative photography work from the beginning that will transport the watcher into another world beyond the mundane. I liked the chemistry between Norton and Biel. They definitely showed the passion of trying to hide their love from onlookers. The lovers are plagued with the world working against. Tons of problems get in their way such as arranged marriage, different classes, high-profile lives, police scrutiny and murder which makes it impossible to declare their love, much less get a moment together.Giamatti plays the inspector who's fascinated by magic and tries to makes sense out of seemingly supernatural events. Although you see some of the action from the lovers' points of view, the story is very much told through Giamatti's observations.If you like romance and the 19th century, you will love The Illusionist. I saw The Prestige around the same time which I found to be dark, brooding, and ugly (it was very disappointing). The Illusionist was everything I hoped the Prestige was going to be and more. I initially got turned off from seeing the Illusionist because reviews said the leads had no chemistry and there wasn't much of a mystery. I completely disagree. The Illusionist is a lovely film that uses magic for beauty, not for evil.",10,0,0,10 May 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Bring the Handkerchiefs
","If you don't enjoy tearjerkers, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn't for you, Wow, I haven't cried this much at a film in a long time. I brought my boyfriend's teenage sister and we shared a good, cry fest.I know a lot of people have commented on the length of the film. Yes, it is long but I feel that it was necessary to bring the depth needed to get personally involved with the characters. The character development was excellent; relationships weren't just assumed.There are really two stories in the film. The first is the obvious one, a man aging backwards, but just as much of the story is devoted to a little girl as she transforms into a superficial young women, then into maturity. It was a great contrast to really explore what a person goes through while aging (enhanced with amazing make up and acting).There's tragedy in the film but there's also comic relief so you never get the feeling of hopelessness while watching. There are some beautiful, erotic dance scenes that are somehow also tasteful which I wasn't expecting. It's hard to describe. You'll have to see the film to understand.I honestly feel that saying Benjamin Button is the same as Forrest Gump is unfair. The only thing the characters have in common is being born with disadvantages and having someone believe in them. That's all though. Benjamin Button isn't a fairy tale and is no where near as light-hearted as Forest Gump (which was a relief). The two movies have a completely different tone to them. Benjamin Button is more of a parable about aging and loss. Button is an intelligent man, fully aware of his disadvantages and the pain it may cause.On a lighter note, there's also great costuming. They really got the look and clothing of the time periods right (and there are a lot of time periods). The 1930s, 1940s and 1950s dresses were distinct and correct for each decade. I wouldn't be surprised if the film won some awards for its flawlessness.Benjamin Button wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be either. It was a very nice, solid film. Definitely worth the price of admission.",10,1,3,26 December 2008
Children of Men," Lot's of death with a sprinkling of comic relief
","To say the film paints a dark portrait of the future is an understatement. Suicide kits and anti-depressants are handed out like candy in a world where people can't even take care of themselves, but crave children and pregnancy.Life is disposable, but the potential for life is revered.Children of Men is more like a war or chase flick than a sci-fi story. The only similarity I see to Blade Runner is that it takes place in the future. Comparing Blade Runner to Children of Men is like comparing filet mignon to chicken mcnuggets.If you like action movies, you'll probably love this. It's not a character driven film. There's a lot of bombing, explosions and violence, with a few comedic scenes with Michael Caine to break up the tension. There's also some over-the-top angelic music whenever there's a sign of hope.So if you like seeing very sad films about a future being overtaken by disease, despair, death and destruction, go see Children of Men. It's perfect for the pessimist.I have to agree with the other reviewers who said that it's more like sci-fi fast food with editing like The Prisoner. It felt like I was watching war footage from Iraq spliced into a rescue story.",7,4,9,8 January 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," A Very Clever Romantic Comedy/Tragedy
","I'm going to avoid spoilers as much as possible in my review because the magic of watching Stranger Than Fiction is the mystery surrounding the character Harold Crick. If you would like a story with some very original comedic elements that don't aim to be disgusting, this may be what you're looking for. This film was truly unoffensive which is quite refreshing, and managed to be interesting and a lot of fun to watch too. Be sure to see this film from the beginning. There are some exceptionally clever things that happen that help with the character development.Stranger Than Fiction has a fantasy element combined with a romantic dramedy element. Somehow the film manages not to fall into being a sentimental sappy mess either. I would place it between The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. It's not quite as fantasy-like as the Truman show and it's not quite the tragic romance of Eternal Sunshine. I didn't get the feeling that it was trying to give an earth-shattering message about life, but it also wasn't light-hearted fluff either. It was a very balanced film with good acting, a great plot and a lot of laughs. It was a very solid movie.I saw the film with my family and my boyfriend and we all left the theater in a good mood which to me, says a lot about a film. It was a very satisfying experience.",9,0,1,24 November 2006
The Secret Life of Pets," Darker than expected, not for small children
","The preview gives the impression this is a light comedy. Some parts are cute and sweet, while others are very dark and just plain cruel. Some animals have very nefarious plans. At the screening I attended, when those evil plans were revealed, about 15 people walked out of the theater (about 6 or 7 families with children under 8). There's a character that gets off on violence and violent stories.That being said, it's not a horrible film. It definitely has its moments, but the pacing is just odd. It can't make up its mind. Characters change alliances randomly. One minute it's funny, the next it's very disturbing.There's even a psychedelic, drug-like sequence all of a sudden which just seems out of place and is just weird. I couldn't wait till it was over.The film was obviously made by and for dog lovers, not cat lovers too.I left the theater feeling empty at the end.If you're looking for a solid family film, Finding Dory is a better choice and movie overall. You might want to pre-screen The Secret Life of Pets if you have small children.",5,6,17,11 July 2016
Princess Mononoke," Better Quality Animation
","Films like these are certainly setting the mark very high for animation. The monsters, creatures, gods, demons, animals, backgrounds and what ever else I've missed are top quality. It certainly gives the feeling of an animated illustration.The story is good too. It goes back to the struggle of nature versus man. Throw in some gods, demons, curses and magic to create quite a spectacle.I found only two major weaknesses in the film.1) Some of the voices for the English version are horribly miscast. I would rather have heard an expert, non-famous, voice actor than some of the star-studded cast choking their way through the dialog.2) The ending was rather weak. It still didn't clearly wrap up the story and the destiny for each character. Some were clear, while others were not. I won't say more. I don't want to spoil it.",8,1,3,28 December 2006
V for Vendetta," V is for very, very, bored
","I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it didn't. I was squirming in my seat when the second hour rolled around. Perhaps if I had just taken a contemporary American society class at a liberal college this film would have dazzled me (that was me SEVERAL years ago), but the social commentary is nothing new to me now. I found the film to be old news and a bad photocopy of a lot of other films and ethics textbooks.Basically the film romanticizes terrorism as a way to defeat a fascist government. The funny thing is that the government sets up the illusion of the country being threatened by terrorists doing biological warfare, when the government actually created these experiments in the first place. One of the experiments gets free and has a vendetta against the government. It has a similar plot to the recent Aeon Flux film without the cloning factor. The film also romanticizes homosexuality in an oppressive, Christian society. I'm not judging these aspects here, I just wanted to summarize the themes.My main problems with the film: I found the characters to be two-dimensional, the plot to be predictable and the pacing to be painfully slow. The visuals were dark except for the scene with a pedophile bishop and lesbians falling in love. I didn't find the film inspiring. The dreary style and tone of the film dragged. Also the monologues kept pushing the same ideas. By the end, I didn't care what point the film was trying to make (I knew that within the first five minutes of the film from a long monologue). I just felt beaten down with repetition after two hours of being slapped in the face with liberalism. The theme didn't matter. It could have been fascism or Christianity and I would have felt the same way with this style of film-makingI wish I had just rented the director's cut of Blade Runner. It would have been way more satisfying.",1,3,10,26 March 2006
The Island," A Two Hour Commercial for Aquafina, XBox, Puma, Ben & Jerrys, Michelob, and more...
","'Let's find a way to sell our products and have people PAY to see the advertisements.' This must have been what the marketing executives said when they conceived of this film, that is more of a LONG commercial than a movie. Okay, I'm aware of product placement in films. We've all grown up and seen it. Most of the time it's easy to ignore, but this film's cinematographer must be the king of product pushing. Just about every scene begins with a closeup on a featured product and spends several seconds lingering upon it. Couple that with the size of a movie screen and a beer can becomes the size of Godzilla! These advertisers must have said to each other 'Sci-Fi films are hot right now. Let's use that as the vehicle and jam as many products in there as we can.' I could write the whole list of product that I remember from the film, but I don't want to spoil it for everyone (please, sense my sarcasm here).As for the plot, it has an interesting premise, but there are so many holes in its execution, I wonder how people can actually think this is a great film? If you're interested in sci-fi, see classics like Blade Runner (director's cut), Logan's Run, White Dwarf, Brazil, Gattaca, or Star Wars 4, 5, or 6. If you like action, rent any of the Die Hard series or The Long Kiss Goodnight. When Blade Runner pushed Coke, it was done in a creative way by showing advertising in the future. It didn't detract from the film. Please save your money and don't waste your time on this garbage. At least you can mute the commercials when you watch TV.My rating is a 1 because of the decent cast and good acting (I guess the advertisers could afford to throw a lot of money at the excellent cast). I refuse to encourage the making of these kinds of films and shame on the people who enable this. I guess the world is going the way of Demolition Man where every restaurant in the future is a Taco Bell. By the way, Demolition Man is also in the mix as a film to see if you want to laugh. It's sci-fi that makes fun of itself. Other films like this are Sleeper and Galaxy Quest. My point is there are so many better films than The Island. See those instead. If you simply must see something on the big screen right now, see Batman Begins or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. You should only see The Island if it's for free or you'll be wanting your $10 back.A lot the the positive comments I have seen for this film read like a mad lib (fill in actor here, fill in movie here, **insert name** is really hot). If you look at the yahoo comments, there is no history on the reviewer and they don't bother to even do a detailed review. I can just see a PR person with a random name generator like they have for hot mail inserting all of these to recoup some of the losses for this summer flop.",1,2,7,20 August 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Waste of Time
","If you judge woman by their breast size, this movie is for you.If you like stupid, sexist humor, this movie is for you. I found the movie insulting to my eyes, ears and intellect. Perhaps a bunch of drunk, yokels may enjoy it. I did not find it clever or entertaining at all. This is the lowest common denominator of humor.There's one funny joke with a cougar in a car, but the rest is a big waste of time.After seeing the movie, I was with a group of friends who rented it (I hadn't shared my review and none of them had seen it yet). I tried to give it another chance, but after 25 minutes one of my friends shut it off and called it garbage.",2,3,6,24 January 2007
