The Longest Yard," Paul Crew is back and the cast he brings with him is funnier and meaner
","One of the perks of being in the military is they will often release movies to us early. In this case I just saw Adam Sandler in 'The Longest Yard'. It's a remake of the 70s classic that starred Burt Reynolds. Where a washed up former All-Star NFL QB goes to jail for violating parole after he destroys the rich girls car. I believe the movie to be as funny or funnier than the original. Burt Reynolds is very good as the old hand and it turns out Micheal Irvin can act. Of course as with any Adam Sandler movie one of his buddies shows up in a unexpected role as is normal for an Adam Sandler movie. Courtney Cox plays the ultimate B!t&h extremely well as the girl that was 'keeping' Paul Crewe before he steals her car.My son laughed until his stomach hurt and I wasn't far behind. Funny bit parts and players were played by some of the following:Dan Patrick, Jim Rome, Howie Long, Stone Cold, Brian Bosworth, Bill Romanowski.Definite must see movie for the fan of sports movie fans. The official release date is 27 May.",8,12,26,22 May 2005
