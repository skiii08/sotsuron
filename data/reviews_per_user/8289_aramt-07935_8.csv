The Equalizer," Very very far fetched,but fun for sure!
","Very very far fetched,but fun for sure!
Absolutely not realistic,but do I want it ina cation movie?No,I want crazy action and that what's this film about!",6,2,3,29 June 2019
Hereditary," What's the hype about...
","That is one of the most boring, self indulgent and plain stupid movies ive ever seen.
The mother, father actors are very very good, but the only horror in this film is the astonishingly disturbing ugliness of the actress portraying Charlie,just plain scary... she belongs to a carnival not cinema...absolutely disgustingly ugly little flick...",1,2,14,16 June 2019

Climax," Gaspar Noe down the drain...
","Not a big fan of this director but with previous films,he proved to be a one of a kind visionary.Don't have to like him to feel his intense genious.
