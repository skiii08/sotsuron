10 Cloverfield Lane," Tightly woven thriller
","10 Cloverfield Lane is an amazing thriller that thrives on exploiting the pitfalls of human imagination. With 10 Cloverfield Lane, Trachtenberg succeeds in creating a story that deliberately presents and withholds information. Much like parsing a mystery novel, parsing 10 Cloverfield Lane means speculation from pieces of the whole, and hoping that the story reveals the characters' reality.The tense atmosphere on which thrillers thrive is supported by a powerful performance from the main cast. John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead play their roles perfectly, contributing to an immersive experience in which the viewer feels compelled by each character's motivations. Moviegoers need not be afraid that acting will hamper an already well-crafted world.Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane successfully designed a paranoid's nightmare with strong characters, that will have audience members simultaneously eager and uneasy. Not for the faint of heart, perfect for the curious of mind.",9,0,2,19 March 2016
