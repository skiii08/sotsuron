Men in Black 3," Too mushy for MIB series
","I don't know how they do it but even after the first release of MIB in 1997, they made Will Smith look almost as young as he was back then and made Tommy Lee Jones look just as old as he has always been in this movie series.To be frank, MIB movie plots haven't ever been 'very great' or 'smart'. But the good thing with MIB has always that they have been hilarious with their dumb plots and that's what keeps the movie interesting. You take out funny aliens and the talking dog from the movie, it doesn't remain so attractive anymore. Leaving out the countable funny scenes from the movie, I felt the movie overall was kind of 'mushy'... sniff! They put too much emotions at place where it was not required... Another part that I admired in the prequels were the funny dialogs exchanged between Lee Jones and Will Smith, former being a tight a$$ and latter being the funny guy!* Spoiler Alert ahead * In this series as Will Smith goes back in the past to meet younger Lee Jones, the movie missed to cash out on their chemistry too.What was good with the movie was the character of all the MIB agents. Will Smith, Lee Jones and Josh Brolin (younger Lee Jones) all have acted very well in all the movies and all fit perfectly in their role. Although I felt the Alien Griffin was being pushed into scenes to help our heroes. Either ways, I have no complaints with the acting of characters in the movie.My suggestion: Don't be surprised if you don't end up watching a MIB movie not-so-hilarious as its prequels when you go to watch MIB 3.",6,8,16,27 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Fun movie to watch
","If you have read the Sherlock Holmes books, then you would easily make out that character of Sherlock in the movie doesn't come out quite like that. The character of Sherlock in the book, suits when you are reading the book. Putting the same serious character out in the movie would have been a disaster. The character of Sherlock, in my opinion, is much more fun for movie-audience. Alright, looks like this is what the movie makers have done: They have taken character of Sherlock from the book and tried to ponder what could make his character more appealing to movie-audience? 'Let's add humour to the duo of Sherlock and Watson', 'Let's add some good action to the movie', 'Let's make a spicy story'.. Sherlock in the movie is an overexcited person who enjoys solving mysteries and enjoys it to an extent that he forgets everything else. This involvement of Sherlock's mind in solving mysteries gives him special power to figure out things and predict precisely what could have happened in a 'crime scene'. Although there will be some parts where you would wonder how could Sherlock have predicted that? The story is not too complicated, what I found to be more complicated was the English Accent. It always seems like the English folks keep adding more and more complicated words in sentences... big show-off! Thanks to the subtitles I didn't miss much of the story. Unlike most of the regular stories that involves solving mystery, in this movie you would know from the beginning who the villain is. What remains mysterious in the movie is how the villain tries to accomplish his goals. Sherlock and Watson are trying to stop the villain from achieving his goals and hence prevent the next world war.My suggestion: This movie is fun to watch with family. With its mix of mystery, action and humour, it will guarantee you remain entertained!",7,0,1,30 December 2011
Ted," Hilariously creative
","Sometimes you know you are going to hate a movie the minute it starts. When TED started, those were my feelings. The movie starts with a fairy tale kind-of narration of a boy's wish which makes his teddy bear come to life, Ted. By this time I was sure I was going to hate this movie.Teddy Bears usually have an image of being cute cuddly and something that you relate to kids. This movie changes that image in a humorous way. In the next scene the teddy and the boy (John) are all grown up. Both have a mature adult voice, they smoke pod, they talk dirty and still live together. There is something hilarious about a 'Teddy Bear' swearing on the big screen. The movie is all about how the friendship of John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (Teddy bear) comes between John's love life. John and Ted have a great bond and are awesome together, and so is the pair of John and his girl-friend Lori (Mila Kunis). John finds it hard to let go of either of them and ends up fighting with Ted and kicking him out of his apartment. What I liked about the movie was the imagination of bringing a bear to life and changing the role of him from just being a kid's play toy. Ted is hilariously funny and his friendship with John is naturally entertaining. Also the chemistry between John and Lori is very charming and real. You will definitely enjoy these two as much you enjoy the other two.My suggestion: Don't miss Ted; he will make you Laugh your AO! But be sure to not take your kids with you, this is *not* a kids movie.",9,2,7,5 August 2012
Life of Pi," Loved the picturization, but found story-line to be weak
","We have always been told that value of Pi is best calculated as 22/7 but you wouldn't know that 355/113 give a more accurate value of Pi than 22/7. However, using 22/7 makes it easier for to do calculations and that's the reason why it is used often.Done with beating around the bush... time to criticize!From the time movie start you can't help but notice the 'beautiful' picturization and cinematography throughout. Add to that the life-like sound affects make you experience the movie almost in real time. This movie shows the wrath of ocean on its survivors and its destructive powers. There have been several movies made about survivors in wild or islands or the sea. This movie makes the survival journey even harder by making the human survive on a small rescue boat with a Royal Bengal Tiger. In my opinion, the presentation of this movie on the big screen was flawless. Plot revealed below.But you can never have a good movie experience until the actors 'live the movie' and convince their audience that it all happened for real. Pi's role is taken by two people, Suraj Sharma when he was younger and Irfan Khan, the older Pi who narrates his life experience to a novel writer. Both have acted very well for their roles, but the role of honest looking younger-Pi seemed to make older Pi's role look a little weaker. During Pi's struggle to survive on a small boat with the fierce tiger, he realises a lot of things, most of it is self realization, the way he loses hope and regains it and the mysterious things he sees in his voyage makes the fictional story intriguing. What I liked about the movie was how Pi starts enjoying the little things he was left with in the rescue boat and how important it becomes for him. But, the most interesting part of the movie is how the boy and tiger learn to survive together and realize that each of them played a big part in keeping them alive.What makes a movie more unrealistic is a big negative for me. I didn't like extra affects that make the ocean look beautifully clear and magical. Another flaw in the story is the way it starts and the way it ends seem to have no connection. In the beginning Pi, as a younger kid seems to be furiously looking see the meaning of life, religion and God. By the end of it, I would have expected that the story would come with a clearer answer. The story makers somehow didn't make the ends meet.My suggestion: Pi is a good movie to experience. Watching it in 3D makes the movie experience even better.",7,7,14,23 November 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Entertaining movie
","Mission Impossible 4 - The Ghost Protocol 07/10MI 4, like its prequels would be a treat to your senses, that is, if you are not too bothered about the story. MI 4 has good picturization, cool gadgets, awesome action scenes and our ever-young Tom Cruise with his good sense of humour. What is not right about the movie is the Story. Don't get me wrong... I actually enjoyed watching the movie. But that alone cannot be used for rating a movie. I would (carefully) put my words to say that MI 4's story is 'not-bad'. It is a very entertaining movie, but not a very realistic script. You would assume that being a secret agent you would have lots of skills and gadgets but that doesn't turn you into God. Tom Cruise and team have performed some stunts that left me stunned. But there is something about Tom Cruise that he almost makes you believe that he could actually do all those things which might be hard for a normal Human Being to do. I guess that is what makes the movie so damn cool to watch.My suggestion: If you decide to just stay home this weekend and do nothing-much, go and enjoy this movie! :-)",7,0,3,16 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise of the planet of the apes review
","Think what happens when another specie on this planet become as intelligent as humans? Or what if that specie come out to be smarter than humans? How will the humans cope with that?'Rise of the planet of the apes' explores these questions that nobody had dared to explore until now. In this movie, humans are testing a drug on Chimps which have made them very intelligent. Now I am not trying to reveal the whole story but for some reason, humans decide to stop production of this drug and kill all chimps involved with this experiment except... one baby chimp. The theme of the movie is based on the very successful formula of 'revolution'. But what I like about the plot is that it doesn't just focus on one theme, but mixes several themes quite well which includes moral and ethical dilemma about scientific development and the human tendency to avoid death. ===Plot vaguely revealed below=== So this baby-chimp grows out to be a very intelligent one and is named 'Caesar'. One of the things about being too smart is that you tend learn fast, you start to think, you desire of... 'freedom'. Feeling secluded from humans, 'Caesar' decides to grow his own kind to be more intelligent and 'free'. However, 'Caesar's quest doesn't compel him on killing humans. What I really admire about the plot is the reluctance of the lead ape to kill any human being until the end. This helps the script to not end in senseless killing of humans by apes, which, I was afraid the movie might fall into that kind of temptation, I am glad it didn't. So the surprising part in the movie is that 'Caesar' is not portrayed as villain, instead, he is portrayed as a leader who saves his-kind from the clutches of humans. ===Plot vaguely revealed above===This movie is very well directed and choreographed. Story in the movie is very strong and fresh. Movie makers have tried to explore new idea that will surely attract crowds. I fell in love with the special effects of this movie that made expressions on the chimps face look very 'human-like'. These special effects are not only good, but will put you back on your feet as it tend to have a scary effect on your mind to see an ape behave like human. The way this movie ends, would suggest that we shouldn't be surprised if a sequel comes out next year.My suggestion: If you are into sci-fi movies, you would like this.",Null,0,1,7 August 2011
The Bourne Legacy," The initial part can put anyone to sleep
","Bourne legacy is a slow set of sequences with a few bursts of action scenes that results in one boring movie. Starting part of the movie is very slow at several instances. I ended up dosing off a few times in the initial parts and apparently, I wasn't alone doing that :-) The story of this sequel is designed to match with the previous series of Bourne movies. But in spite of having a good story line, overall, the movie was not entertaining. Near the end of movie, action sequences pick up and they have done a really good job there, but just when you feel movie starts to wake up the audience... it ends! This movie has one of the most abrupt endings that I had ever seen. By the time movie ended, we were not sure what happened. It was like the movie makers threw up their arms in air after first action sequence and decided 'oh shoot! We just ran out of cash, pack up!'My suggestion: It would be better for you dosing-off at home than in theater! :-)",5,4,11,12 August 2012
Brave," Too much of fantasy
","Watching Brave felt like reading a story out of a fairy tale book. This movie had everything that belonged to a fairy-land. A princess, a King, a Queen, a witch with spells and potions, magic and a lesson for all the kids out there :-) And when there is a princess, there has to be a prince who would fall in love with her and take her away, but no, that's not how it is :-)Spoiler alert, beyond this point What I admired about the movie was that makers decided to move away from the usual theme of princess falling in love with a prince and made a different kind of theme, a family oriented movie. The movie revolves around rebellious teenage princess trying to break traditions and paving her own future. The Queen struggles to make her daughter the perfect princess who has a class and charisma of an ideal Queen.But I usually find flaws in these movie quite easily, they get very predictable after a certain time. The movie wasn't 'extremely-funny' or 'extremely-motivating' or had something that would leave the audience spell bound. I found the Ice-Age trailer to be more entertaining than this movie.My suggestion: If you like animated movies you will enjoy every bit of it. It's an OK-OK movie.",6,1,5,24 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Amazing script
","If you watch a movie that has generated a lot of hype in media and everyone absolutely loves it, chances are that you are not going to like it much because of the raised expectations. Dark knight rises is a kind of movie that you are going to LOVE... in spite of all the hype :-)Batman is a legend in the Gotham city, this movie brings back the lost Batman to Gotham. The movie as a whole has been filmed with faded black and grey tinge. The way movie is shot you will get to see very little colors on the screen other than white, black and grey. This produces dismal picture which is dark most of the times, the mood is kind of sad... Until you see batman walk-in. When Batman walks-in, all the focus is on him, music picks up, gadgets come out and bad guys almost wet their pants. As always Batman is loaded with awesome gadgets and this time he has upgraded to better ones. And the best of all, you are going to still adore his motor cycle. By the time you walk out of theater, you will feel like Batman :-)Like the prequel, Bane, the villain has done a very convincing job. The voice and face of Bane can terrorize anyone in the audience. The best part about the movie was that, when Bane unleashes his terror on Gotham, you can feel the pain and tension of people in the city. Story of The Dark Knight Rises is not very simple to comprehend, but by the time movie ends, it all comes together as to what a beautiful script this movie was made with.My suggestion: There's not better way to spend your weekend than watching Batman in action. If you are confused between Ice Age and Batman, you know which one to pick.",9,3,8,29 July 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Hilariously brilliant!!
","Whoever said watching a movie in 3D is the same as watching it in 2D, got it all wrong. Madagascar 3 has amazing 3D effects which will really make you experience the movie in a different way. From the beginning till the end, you will get into fits of laughter and the animals will keep you entertained. The overall plot of the movie is good but what really steals the show are the new Italian circus animals and their Italian accent. I always felt that the real hero's of this smart Penguins and Marti, the Lion, is only a pseudo hero.What I didn't like about this movie was the unrealistic villain and her super human abilities, although funny, but at some point you will feel it was too much. But I can bet you won't notice the small things with the crazy animals making you LOL through out.My suggestion: Don't miss this one, and watch it in 3D.",9,36,64,9 June 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Awful!
","'The cabin in the woods' might have the dumbest plot for a Horror movie you could ever imagine. Watching this movie made me feel like watching a Bollywood movie, where everything feels right till the first half. Bollywood movies are expert at screwing the second half of any movie, this movie was one step ahead of that.The first half of this movie has everything that a Young audience demands: funny college students going out for a vacation at a secluded cabin in a forest with an awesome lake by side. There's one dopy dude who's character is awesome, dumb and funny. The movie does produce some horror and suspense, but what really turns you off is the whole plot, which you will realize at the end is a really really crappy one.My suggestion: Not worth watching this in your dreams either.",3,10,20,9 June 2012
