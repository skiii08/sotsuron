Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Absolutely incredible
",By far the greatest movie experience I have ever had. It is so great to see the characters as they began and to meet so many wonderful new creatures.The only bad thing about seeing this movie is realizing how long we have to wait for the next one.It also sucks to realize what is going to happen to that poor boy.,10,0,0,20 May 1999
