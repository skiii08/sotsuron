Scarface," One of the great performances
","Ok it might not have been everyones cup of tea and the violence and bad language may have turned a lot of folk off the movie but who can deny the brilliance of Al Pacino's performance in this epic crime story? He 'became' Tony Montana for the film, it was a flawless portrayal of the Cuban refugee, definitely Pacino's best ever, even the great man himself believes this. Performances like this are rare and should be appreciated, i never thought for one moment that it was Al Pacino on the screen , it was always Tony Montana. Perfection, what more can be said? And by the way, the film was brilliant too.",Null,0,0,18 September 1999
The Commitments," Great Fun, great story
","the fist time i watched this film, i found it so funny that i nearly wet myself. but the more i watched it, the more i could detect a brilliant story behind a witty script, a story about the rise and fall of a talented group due to the battle of egos within the band. not to mention the fantastic sound track, this film has it all.",9,1,2,20 September 1999
Saving Private Ryan," excellent but.....
","Astounding action scenes, the best ever seen. However its one and only flaw is the 'americanisation' of the war defined by the shots of the stars and stripes flag. What was he thinking? An outstanding film dragged into the depths of 'Independence Day' and 'Armageddon' as America saves the world. Such a pity.",9,0,0,30 August 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A superb package of fun
","This is an extraordinary piece of film making shot on a small budget. It was a 'far out' script that works perfectly, ably backed up by some outstanding performances from lesser known actors. I mean who could have been prepared for all the twists and turns the movie takes, its like a roller coaster ride from start to finish. It is the must see movie of the past two years and if you haven't seen it, get it now!",10,0,0,18 September 1999
