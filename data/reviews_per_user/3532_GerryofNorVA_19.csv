Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A new trilogy sixteen years later.
","George Lucas went all 'oooooh ahhhh' with updated CGI capabilities but neglected the 'heart' of storytelling. I've watched this film several times over the years and I still feel the same criticisms. How he ever thought adding this level of boring politics to the story was good for it just shows how out of touch he was. It's like all's he had were 'yes men' around him, because not only did they not dissuade him from the politics problem, but they let him go ape sht with CGI with its anti-septic level of cleanliness and a whole race of Jar Jar Binks. Focused so much on this he was that he neglected to direct human actors which all come off as wooden as a troop of Keanu Reeves. Youngling Anakin Skywalker on the other hand, all of what 10 yrs old, can do no wrong - expert racer, strong with the Force he knows nothing of, then destroys a huge space warship by accident. BTW, did you catch that his was an immaculate conception?! And he's some kind of prophesied Chosen One?! Crazy stuff man.",7,2,4,23 December 2019
Hereditary," A tale of madness that leaves you off balance
","This is tough for me to rate. I can appreciate the good production values and some great acting, especially Toni Collette who should get an Academy Award nom for her effort. In fact, her unraveling recalls Shelley Duvall's performance in 'The Shining'. And there was the unsettlingly weird look of newcomer Milly Shapiro who I thought was the little girl in 'Les Miserables' but no. This film was more a study of the descent into madness/psychosis that was colored with horror. It wasn't a horror genre film like Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. But because it's a story about madness some of the scenes are difficult to understand and to determine if they're 'real' or part of the character's madness. I'm a dude and not easily scared or intimidated so this film rather than scaring me was just more unsettling and disturbing, it left me in a bad mood, especially with the very odd, weird, again unsettling final scene. It was good for what it is, but I don't like what it is so I guess that rates a '6', very hard to rate.",6,3,6,14 October 2018
Rocketman," Better titled as Yellow Brick Road
","The title Rocketman doesn't really work for this musical biopic by Dexter Fletcher, a longtime actor trying to direct and with not much success. As others have noted, the production is kind of all over the place, some parts decent other parts forgettable. Many key sequences are put to music which are hit and miss, take Rocketman for instance, you'd think it would have something to do with outer space or its loneliness but they pair it with a hospital scene, ugh. Taron Egerton excels in the role but the supporting cast fades pretty much. The film, with Elton John as one of the EPs, does reveal to us his life of being mostly unloved by parents and those that profess to love him, with Bernie Taupin really being the only one by his side the whole time. One key disappointment was that it gave such short shrift to his first marriage to a woman and whiffed on the associated 'Someone Saved My Life Tonight' hit song. Another disappointment is that it doesn't keep us informed of what year many of the scenes play out. This biopic could've and should've been so much better.",7,1,2,23 September 2019
Knives Out," Slow start but finishes well
","All star cast directed by the guy hot off of 'The Last Jedi', what could go wrong? Well, the wife and I fell asleep during the first 20-mins, so big ding for early pacing. The next night I insisted we finish it because 'all star cast...' and it turned out well. It was a decent enough whodunnit with a few twists/misdirections. The final scene could've been better architected, so we weren't really satisfied with its denouement.",7,1,2,22 February 2020
Deadpool 2," In a category of its own
","Deadpool is its own genre of movie - action/comedy/commentary, oh, and foul, foul language, my god, it's like over the top with the most foul of them. So though it's an 'R', there should be a lower limit of age 14 due to language and so much massive amounts of gratuitous death and dismemberment. Seriously, there's a portion of the public that may need trauma therapy after viewing this. Anyway, it's a heck of a fun ride. Ryan's snarky commentary throughout is funny but it's uneven because he doesn't apply it to his love scenes with Vanessa (Morena B), but that's a minor nit that's certainly offset by so many other areas of strength. TJ Miller is always a comedic treat, just saw him in 'Ready Player One' last night, too. And the character 'Domino' made for some entertaining moments with her super ability of 'luck'. A fun, solid '9' of a movie - and I don't hand those out often.",9,1,2,14 October 2018
Molly's Game," Great example of a story fulfilling its potential
","New director Aaron Sorkin made 'Molly's Game', which could've been a snorefest, into an 'Ocean's 11' style fast-paced casino story. Jessica Chastain was amazing as always with a good supporting performance by Idris Elba. It's a good tale of powering through setbacks, rising up then falling down, but sticking by some guiding principles - not selling your friends out even when it will bring you a big advantage. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",8,7,11,14 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars fatigue
","My impressions: meh, formulaic, predictable, posers, wannabes, deus ex machinas throughout, especially with its christmas present wrapped happy ending aimed at the pre-teen demo. So, yeh, BIG disappointment to the conclusion of the first ever cinematic trilogy-of-trilogies spread over 40+ years. What should've been a lifetime of fantasticosity peters out in a bland, seen-it-before shadow of its original trilogy self. JJ Abrams should NOT be proud of this.",3,5,13,28 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Succeeds in spite of itself
","'Attack of the Clones' opens 10yrs later and finds Queen, er, Senator Padme Amidala still playing her look alike decoy games even though this surely would've been public knowledge after the events of 'Phantom Menace'. Weak. Then we find Anakin now about 20yo as apprentice to longer haired Obi-Wan but when they meet Padme, love-lorn Anakin goes way off script backtalking Obi-Wan forcing the latter to chastise him in front of everyone. This scene is beyond ridiculous since any such recalcitrant behavior would've been disciplined out of him by this point. So weak. Then the speeder chase scene at night in a lot of multi-level traffic proceeds mishap-free as if there were no other vehicles in sight. Weak. And this is just the opening few minutes! The dialogue is just immature at best, and all Anakin's patronizing 'yes, Master''ing is so tiresome. When the assailant/fugitive is captured by Obi and Anakin - which btw are neglecting their primary protection duty of Padme - the bounty hunter who hired her darts her dead when he could've as easily darted them! They apparently didn't 'sense' that danger! There are key story elements that dangle like loose ends. For instance, what is this prophecy of One who will bring the Force back into balance? That was first brought up in Phantom but it's not detailed/described, there's no evidence the Force is out of balance! There's just this unsupported bantering about it. The whole Padme/Anakin dynamic which is supposed to be Jedi protecting a Senator is a dumb romantic courtship. Someone as influential and attractive as Padme would've long been taken by another politician to increase their power structure, but instead we're treated to an adolescent fever dream. The rest of the film suffers from the same half-baked writing and direction, thanks again to an unchecked George Lucas. This is the poor level of storytelling/film-making you get when the same guy is the only executive producer, director, writer, and editor! That's one dude with control issues.",6,2,3,25 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," A feature-length 'Behind the Music'
","Bohemian Rhapsody reveals a fairly decent glimpse 'behind the scenes' of Queen's beginnings but focuses more on Freddie Mercury, of course. You'll find out when and why Farrokh Bulsara changed his name and when he determined he was bi. You'll also learn that when Freddie makes a firm decision, it's final. You'll also see the beginnings of their hallmark title song but interestingly it's never fully played, kind of ironic. In many ways, the film is very similar to A&E's 'Behind the Music' documentaries. What it doesn't show, though, is actual footage of Freddie/Queen, nor does it show Freddie's death/funeral, both of which I found a bit disappointing.",8,1,1,27 February 2019
Toy Story 4," A technical marvel
",The content of Toy Story 4 is for kids and young families but its technical wizardry is for us techies. It's an amazingly created animated world that begs to be admired in almost every scene.,6,0,0,24 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 1969's Tate-LaBianca Murders: An Alternate Ending
","Most films you can distill to a simple 'This film was about...', not this one. There are so many things it's about. It's mainly a slice of life from the late 60s at the time of the Tate-LaBianca murders (Manson). But it's chiefly about American muscle in the form of Cliff Booth (stuntman) and Rick Dalton (western actor). Cliff (Brad Pitt) shames Bruce Lee in studio lot fight, shames one of Manson's hippie boys, and drives a big 'ole Cadillac El Dorado or something like it. Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) uses a flame thrower from one of his films to torch another Manson hippie during the grand finale home invasion. And in this tinsel-town fantasy tale of the Tate-LaBianca murders, the Manson clan gets their asses kicked, which is of course how we'd all like to think it should've happened once upon a time in Hollywood...",7,0,2,27 November 2019
Meet Joe Black," Worst love story before Gigli happened
","My two star rating is largely for the production values and a star cast that includes luminaries Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. The highly implausible, largely senseless story and plot get a zero unless you're a tween girl who cares for nothing other than seeing a wooden/stoic Brad smooching his leading lady (unknown Claire Forlani), which must be why this film gets scores in the 8/9/10 range. Yes, it's a fantasy that involves death personified but granting you that as an element of the story is fine. It's the presentation and execution of this character that shows a level of immaturity and implausibility not typically associated with director Martin Brest, but then again this is the guy that went on to direct Ben Affleck and J-Lo in 'Gigli' one of the worst romances of all time, so bad in fact, that it was Brest's last stint as a director! So, clearly 'Meet Joe Black' was a descent into the disastrous 'Gigli'.",2,1,6,14 January 2020
1917," Well made but somewhat sanitized
","I understand the plaudits for this film, it was really good in many aspects and deserving of its awards and nominations; however, I'm apparently one of only a few that noticed the intellectual dishonesty, the unnecessary sanitization of battle-emotion, that is, when Blake was knifed by the German pilot he and Scofield tried to save, there was no cursing, no racial epithets, in fact, no anger, and that's the problem, no true feelings, inauthentic, sanitized. The film is already rate 'R' but it was a soft R likely due to mild language and gruesome scenery, so an honest, R-rated display of battle-emotion would've been perfectly fine and accepted, but instead we get PG, not even PG-13 and that's a big hit against the film's authenticity for me, even amidst so much genuine experience.",6,3,4,25 March 2020
Joker," Joke's on us
","Todd Phillips wrote and directed this travesty, this study of insanity that's somehow an origin story for the Joker villain. This was just a poor adaptation already in need of a reboot. Joaquin P was exemplary in his portrayal of the material given him, it was just poor material. This is born out in the fact that the 'Joker 2' sequel is NOT written by Todd or co-writer Scott Silver. In any case, the first 90-mins should've been edited to 30-mins - way too much useless filler. The final 30-mins is where the action is at but it's really a portrayal of a criminally diminished mental capacitant than of a masterful arch-villain. This particular Joker character is a mentally and emotionally stunted unfortunate who has no capacity, no potential to become 'The Joker' criminal mastermind we have all come to admire as a key foil to Batman. This was a wasted effort and should be archived a mile underground.",2,6,15,18 January 2020
12 Strong," Should've been a mini-series
","If you like military historicals, then this is fine. I had two problems to note: the first is that they've got Rob Riggle (better known for comedic roles) playing the serious role of Col. Bowers. If he's trying to break into action/drama, fine, but this wasn't the film to do that, IMHO. Second, a film of 2 hrs doesn't do justice to material like this. This story should be a mini-series at least. There's a LOT going on in the month following 9/11 and squeezing into 2 hrs gives important events short shrift. Outside of those two things, the film was decent enough, full of good ole American bravado which may have been over-dramatized but whatever, it's entertaining and educational enough.",7,1,1,14 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Should be renamed to The Rise of Vader
","'Revenge of the Sith' opens with more politics in the scrolling exposition, ugh, and in our opening space battle we find that Obi-Wan is now a military general, really?! But still dressed in humble robes while flying a battle mission, ugh. And he seems too well groomed to be a Jedi knight and general with his feathered hair style from our time. Could the designers not give him a more time and environment appropriate style? He's just so out of sync. Weak. Anakin is still Obi's padawan but continues in his backtalking arrogance. When Obi tosses off his overcoat to confront Dooku his Jedi fashion looks more like medieval apprentice-wear than state-of-the-art Jedi protective-wear which is closer to what Anakin sports in black leather. Weak. And the fact that Dooku - the grand leader of the successful galactic separatist movement - chooses to confront two Jedi by himself (with a couple of token droids) is just poor storytelling again George Lucas. In any other story Dooku would've been surrounded by legions of Sith warriors, and never have been vulnerable. So weak. And I am so tired of Obi/Anakin being able to lightsaber their way out of captivity every single time. Again, it's just lazy/weak storybuilding when you deus ex machina every challenging situation, it just wastes our time. And we learn that though Anakin and Padme are married (from 'Attack...') they're still hiding that fact from everyone as unlikely as that can be. Seriously, a senator like Padme would have a close circle of friends and advisors, any of which she would've confided in at some point, or been found out. Again, any other veteran storyteller would've given us a more mature, complex/realistic treatment of this and other story elements. And surely it's a dire violation of the Jedi Code for him to be married yet somehow he's hidden that from ALL the Jedi who are supposed to be able to sense such things. So very weak. Oh, and she's pregnant, so that's going to be fun. BTW, ever notice it's never raining, anywhere, any planet, ever. Must be too hard for LucasFilms to CGI it. But I do have to admit the events leading up to Anakin's conversion to Darth Vader were well crafted. However, that praise quickly falls when you realize that not once during the massacre of the Jedi did Obi ever inquire of Anakin's safety or whereabouts. Even the VFX misfire occasionally, like when Anakin and Obi face off near the end, Obi draws his lightsaber from his waist but it doesn't activate when he swings it out and you can tell he meant it to. The VFX techs fumbled that one. Anyway it was genuinely fascinating to see that as Luke and Leia were born as offspring of Anakin and Padme that Anakin was being resuscitated as the dark-clad Darth Vader - two very interesting and very different types of birth. But at the end when Senator Organa instructs that C3PO's mind be wiped, that comes off as another lazy, cover-the-plot-hole way of force-fitting him into the next trilogy where he had no prior knowledge of all these events, ugh. Again, much of these failings can be laid right at the feet of George Lucas who wrote, directed, edited, and generally managed everything by himself. You HAVE to permit others to critique and collaborate otherwise you get subpar stories like this.",7,0,5,25 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Better titled as A Newer Hope
","Oh my god, I just got done re-watching/reviewing the trilogy prequel by George Lucas and always lamented how poorly written/directed they were right from the outset but my gourd, how much better The Force Wakens started than those! Though JJ Abrams wrote/directed this one, at least there's a small army of producers and a different editor. George 'I have control issues' Lucas' prequels sadly had no other input than his own. The first chase scene was weak though, Rey, with Finn, commandeers the Millenium Falcon without any biometrics or start codes, hmm, then she navigates it expertly albeit accidentally, but c'mon, she should've crashed this within the first 10-secs, then through 'Hollywood magic' the two rookies best two trained TIE fighters, ugh, this again. But this was redeemed in a subsequent scene when Rey/Finn attempted to trap some raiders on a freighter but unleashed nasty monsters instead. The rest of the action/story was pretty decent except near the end as the planet 'sploded, those rescues were lazy deus ex. But just at the end when you're noticing that the old gang is all re-unioned except Luke, Rey finds him as an old Sith-lord looking hermit. Without a word, she immediately offers his lightsword, but the way JJ filmed it, it comes off as if she's offering a Coke to him, weird. And that's how he ended it, also weird and unsatisfying.",7,1,13,26 December 2019
Annihilation," So much potential, but just doesn't deliver
","Great concept and some of the execution was really good, but much of it was kind of dumb. Take for instance the all female team sent into The Shimmer. That's a bit too much grrl power and ultra-feminist to be plausible. The pace of the film and the wait-till-the-end-for-the-payoff was very similar to 'Arrival' which I also didn't like, but wanted to. Look, I'm biased to like these sci-fi films but they keep failing to deliver and that's borne out in its revenue, only $32M domestic and not even released internationally. It also proves that Natalie Portman is NOT a box office draw, but who's surprised by that?!",3,1,2,15 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the Originals
","The Empire Strikes Back was the rare movie sequel to match or even surpass its predecessor in terms of story, entertainment, and even revenue. Like millions worldwide, this remains my favorite of not only the original trilogy but the entire saga. Whenever I see it in the tv listings I can easily enjoy watching it again.",9,0,0,16 March 2019
