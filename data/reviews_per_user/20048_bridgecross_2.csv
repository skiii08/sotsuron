The Blair Witch Project," A movie on crutches.
","A few comments down some genius explains how to make this movie more enjoyable.  It seems that if we just go to the official 'Blair Witch' web site and read up on the mythology, we understand the movie better and it becomes more interesting and scary.If that's what movies have come to, then we should just stop going to the theater!  A movie that doesn't stand on its own without a multimedia blitz? I'm supposed to do research before seeing it?  Maybe I should be in the theater with my laptop and a wireless modem absorbing the hype and ignoring the movie.I think of the $120 million this crud has earned and I want to cry.  The only bright spot is that it's going to bomb internationally.",3,0,1,11 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," High expectations.
","Loved it! Hated it! Loved it! Hated it! For anyone who is a true Star Wars fan, but also a discriminating moviegoer, this film will pull you in several directions at once. You'll wince whenever Anakin opens his mouth, but when the good ole Tusken raiders start sniping at the pod race you'll grin from ear to ear.  The pulse quickens during scenes like the R2 units crawling about a spaceship exterior during a battle, but such moments are placed between ponderous dialogue sequences with Neeson and McGregor (not their fault). Natalie Portman has some true sparks and her talent shows through her undeveloped character.  When she professes to feel a connection with Anakin you can believe it, which set the stage for the next film wonderfully.  Too bad Jake Lloyd can't emote; she may as well be talking to a wooden doll. The whole thing is of course visually seamless, and sets a new standard for all movies, not just sci-fi. But there's a quote attributed to Harrison Ford on the set during the original movies; 'You can type this sh*! George, but you sure can't say it.'",6,0,1,20 May 1999
