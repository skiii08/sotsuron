The Incredible Hulk," A Good Effort
","This film is the second one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, after 'Iron Man'. It's not as bad as people make it out to be. It's actually quite a lot of fun, that is if you ignore its many flaws.The producers of this film decided not to completely film The Hulk's origin story here, except through the opening credits, a decision they would repeat 10 years later on Spiderman: Homecoming. At the time it was probably seen as a wise decision, since a previous standalone version, Ang Lee's 'Hulk' came out 5 years before and was already on the minds of comic book fans. However in hindsight, I feel this lessens the impact of the character in the minds of fans.Ed Norton is in it, and he's excellent. However he was a poor choice of casting by Marvel, because he's a difficult to work with. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that this was going to be his only Marvel movie at the time. His reputation was already known.In many ways I prefer this Norton's version to Ruffalo's. This is a real movie, and Hulk is a true character, rather than the comic relief he serves as in later MCU films. He has a love interest in Betty Ross, who is played excellently by Liv Tyler. William Hurt is also perfectly cast as General Ross, and outdoes Sam Elliot, who appeared in Ang Lee's 'Hulk', which is no mean feat.",7,0,1,26 May 2019
Iron Man 2," Fun....Terrible Fun
","It's the worst MCU film. Like the Transformers series, it can be pretty fun, that is, if you are willing to turn your brain off and just go for a ride. It's colorful, its fast, it's loud, it's funny.However it's a terrible film.You have Tony trying to survive his impending death through palladium poisoning, becoming a member the Avengers, facing battles over ownership of his technology from Congress, facing a rivalry from a two bit competitor, and facing a new rival from a Russian man who wants revenge for something that Tony's father did to his father.Does that sound confusing. I'm glad you think so, because it is.This was a quaint time. A period where Mickey Rourke was a hot commodity after years of languishing on the B-List. Funny how times change. He is no longer involved in A films. He probably won't be going back to them anytime soon. What a terrible casting choice. in hindsight. He's terrible in it.In the meantime, much of the core cast went on to star in some of the MCU's later, much better films.That doesn't mean that this film is without its merits. One of my favorite gags involves a scene where Happy Hogan and Black Widow team together to battle a group of thugs. It's pretty cool. There are also echoes of the comic series, where Iron Man battles alcoholism within too, which makes it a lot more compelling.Too bad, this film tried to cram too much story into it. It most definitely could have benefitted from being split into two.",5,0,0,26 May 2019
Thor," Borderline Good
","Thor is one of those movies that fuels film debates for me, because I cannot decide if it was good or bad.On the good side, it's a very interesting take on a comic book movie. Kenneth Branagh does an excellent job of portraying the very Shakespearean relationship between Thor, Loki, and Odin. He also makes liberal use of dutch angles, which do evoke the comics somewhat. It's also quite fun to watch.But the writing on this is terrible. The plot, really comes down to two things, the relationship between Thor, Loki, and Odin, and Thor needing to prove himself as king. If the whole movie was focused on that and not concerned with the love story or setting up The Avengers, it might have become great. Instead we get a crappy love story crammed between a more interesting one, that makes no sense, with two leads have absolutely zero chemistry.I never once felt bad for Thor or felt like he was facing a credible threat like I did when watching other films in the Marvel series. Maybe it's me. He always felt a little too cartoony for me to take seriously.That said the casting on this film was spot on. Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin, and Tom Hiddleston makes an excellent Loki. Although Marvel would redeem itself with its portrayal of Thor in later movies, for a first effort, this was a pretty terrible vehicle to introduce the character.",6,0,2,28 May 2019
Iron Man," Hindsight is 20/20
","It has been over 10 years since Iron Man came out, kickstarting the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is about to come to a conclusion with Spiderman: Far From Home. I wanted to review this movie to see if it holds up.I'm glad to say that it has.definitely lived up to its reputation, though upon reevaluation, I have dropped my score from a 9/10 to an 8/10. As a standalone movie, it is excellent. It's also quite possibly the best superhero origin story I have ever seen.While the film has become dated somewhat since its release. The effects are not as great as they are in later films, and there are some glaring issues with the story when taken as part of a larger saga.As a standalone, however, it's excellent. Robert Downey Junior and Gweneth Paltrow are excellent in their roles, and have excellent chemistry. Terrence Howard also plays Rhodey, and Jeff Bridges oozes evil and charm as Obadiah Stane.This is not one to miss.",8,0,0,26 May 2019
