Casablanca," Casablanca Review
","'We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.' - Rick BlaineBefore, I wasn't really a huge fan of the romance genre. I don't know if it has something to do with the predictable storyline that always had a happy ending, dramatic moments that seem way too dramatic, or rehashing the same concept of love; it just wasn't my cup of tea. However, there was one film that made me change my views and to fully appreciate romance films, and that film was none other than Casablanca. It seems to have the same typical tropes that you would find in any other romance, but one thing that it did had that sets it apart from most romance films, and that is pure quality. What it ended up being is a beautiful looking and well-told story that has since became legendary.Set during World War II, the story centers around Rick Blaine, an American expatriate and former freedom fighter who now runs a successful nightclub and gambling den in the city of Casablanca. His seemingly peaceful life is then interrupted when his former lover Ilsa arrives in town with her husband, a resistance movement leader who's on the run from the Nazis, and asks for Rick's help to escape to Lisbon, so they can flee to America to continue their cause. Rick is reluctant at first, due to his bitter nature and cynical views on the world caused by his and Ilsa's past relationship falling apart, but now must make a choice between his former lover and a chance for hope as the fate of the war hangs in balance.For 1942, this was considered a landmark achievement in cinema history. The elegant black and white cinematography gives it a timeless feel, the story moves at a steady pace, and it's all accompanied by a beautiful and heartwarming musical score. Also, so many memorable lines that has become iconic.'Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.'The performances are all top notch, namely Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet. However, it's the film's two leads, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, who really shines here. Bogart plays it with charm and has such a hypnotizing screen presence you just can't take your eyes off him. Rick, at first, may seem bitter and wants nothing to do with the world's problems, but you soon start to warm up to him when you know a bit more about him and how he once had a happy and peaceful life with the love of his life until it was taken away from him, leaving him cold and heartbroken. You can feel the same for Bergman's Ilsa; how she seemingly lost her husband, but met Rick and both lived a happy life, only to find out her husband is alive and, in haste, left Rick without explanation. You start to actually care about these two when you find out more about them.Overall, Casablanca still remains as a high-water mark of the genre that gets better with ever viewing. After over 70 years, this timeless love story still stands the test of time, and I do believe I have a newfound respect for the genre.'Here's looking at you kid.'Final Verdict: 10/10 with.... eh screw it, the Epic Seal of Awesomeness.",10,3,4,20 February 2019
Se7en," Se7en Review
","I can't believe that I hadn't seen one before, and I'm glad that I did managed to see it. Se7en is often considered to be one of the finest examples of modern crime thrillers and has established David Fincher as one of the finest directors in Hollywood.Set within the course of seven days, it follows two homicide detectives who are on the hunt for a serial killer that based his crimes on the seven deadly sins. As the plot unfolds, a friction arises between the two detectives and how they go about their work as they both race against time to prevent the killer from succeeding his sadistic work.Easily Fincher's darkest film to date, this movie is dripping with an unsettling atmosphere. Right from the opening scene, it lets you know exactly what kind of world we're entering; the lighting, the bleak shadows, the deterioration of the crime-ridden city, the constant rainfall that happens during exterior shots; all of these make the setting feel unsettling and gives the viewers a sense of dread that builds up all the way to the end. The story and the screenplay is masterfully crafted and the slightest details all play a part in the overall narrative.The cast delivers a great performance; Morgan Freeman is very likable as Somerset, an aging detective who has been through hell and is ready to retire and live a peaceful life, but finds that he keeps getting drawn into all the chaos that's happening. Brad Pitt is also good as Mills, a young detective who, while determined to find the killer, he's overly ambitious and is completely naive to the whole situation. Their chemistry is what also makes them great; Mills is cocky and impulsive, while Somerset is calm and self-controlled, and both men try to work off each other.However, the character who steals the show is the serial killer 'John Doe' himself. As soon as he reveals himself to the audience, you can tell he's dripping with dread and evil accompanying him and how he manages to orchestrate his evil plans, all in which builds up to one hell of an intense finale that I refuse to spoil here, but I will say it will make your skin crawl long after you see it.Overall, Se7en still remains as one of the definitive examples of the exploration of the mind of a serial killer and how he manages to do it instead of why he did it, made possible by Fincher's gritty vision that doesn't sugarcoat it. This dark, relentless, and original tale still remains effective now as it was in 1995. One of Fincher's best works; highly recommend it.Final Verdict: 10/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness.",10,0,0,11 March 2019
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump Review
","'My momma always said, 'Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.' - Forrest GumpWho doesn't love Forrest Gump? He is, like, one of the most innocent human beings on the planet. He may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but he has gone on to achieve greatness that most of us couldn't even imagine he could do. Emotionally uplifting, often funny, and inspiring, this movie still retains the magic and positive feeling that Forrest left on millions of Americans when it came out 25 years ago.Based on the novel by Winston Groom, it follows Forrest Gump, a simple-minded Alabama guy who has a heart of gold, as the story chronicles Forrest's life that spans through four decades; from his childhood years, to him being a top college running-back, to him serving in Vietnam, becoming a star ping pong player, owning a successful shrimp company, and going on a 3-year cross-country marathon. While that's going on, he also witnesses and, unintentionally, influences certain key events in the second half of the 20th century American history. However, there's one thing that he truly cares about more than all of the achievements that he has made in his life, and that's his childhood sweetheart, Jenny, who, unlike Forrest, has since been living a self-destructive lifestyle and never reciprocates his feelings for her.An excellently told story that shows us the world through the eyes of Forrest and how, simply for being at the right place at the right time, he achieves all sorts of accomplishments that no one thought he could do. It does takes some liberties from the novel and there are some parts that feel a tad bit sentimental at times. However, the focus still remains on our main character.The overall look of the film is fantastic. Aside from being excellently-directed, the cinematography is great, the music fits the time periods, and the editing moves at a steady pace. The visual effects, surprisingly, even for the time, are pretty impressive, particularly when Forrest meets famous historical figures like JFK, John Lennon, and Richard Nixon. What they did was they took archive footages of these historical figures and digitally integrate Tom Hanks as Forrest into the footage seamlessly, as if Forrest is actually there interacting with these historical figures. Another one, in particular, involves Lt. Dan after he loses both his legs. This was done by wrapping blue fabric and 'roto-painting' around Gary Sinise's legs and then digitally remove them through CG. These effects were done a mere one year after Jurassic Park, which was considered a major game changer in the visual effects department, and while Forrest Gump isn't really a major game changer in that department and there are some small blemishes here and there, still I can't deny that these were impressive for the time; it still looks good though.The performances from the full cast are all excellent. Tom Hanks is the heart and soul of this movie; he delivers a strong and hypnotizing performance as a guy who is gullible, but very likable. Gary Sinise is outstanding as Lt. Dan, Forrest's lieutenant during Vietnam who loses his legs during an ambush and has became a cynical and bitter cripple who feels that he should carry on his family tradition of dying in a American war, until he finds his purpose again when he joins Forrest in the shrimp business, Robin Wright is great as Forrest's love interest, Jenny, who lives a self-destructive lifestyle due to being sexually abused as a child to the point where she becomes a drug addict and nearly commits suicide, Sally Field is also good as Forrest's loving and caring mother, and Mykelti Williamson is great as Forrest's war buddy, Bubba.Overall, Forrest Gump is just as impactful as it was in 1994. Dealing with themes of love, friendship, redemption, and destiny, it's one of my all time favorites and has inspired countless people to follow their dreams, live life to the fullest, and to find their destiny. As Forrest would say, 'Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.' Highly mandatory for any movie buff.'That's all I have to say about that.' - Forrest GumpFinal Verdict: 10/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness.",10,1,2,2 April 2019
Fargo," Fargo Review
","'There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it.' - Marge GundersonPure genius. Those two words are what best describes Coen Brothers' Fargo. I saw this for the first time, and, I'm happy to say, it ranks up there with The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men as one of the Coen's best films with its dark and quirky writing, its gorgeous cinematography, a solid performance from much of the cast, and its mixture of black comedy, violence, and satire that only the Coen Brothers can pull off.This dark and quirky story begins with Jerry Lundegaard, a down-on-his-luck car salesman who is hard up for money to finance for his family. So, he hires two crooks to kidnap his wife so he can extort a ransom from his father-in-law. The plan seems to be going well, until one minor incident leads to three roadside murders and the plan slowly starts falling apart. In the center of all this craziness is Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief who is investigating the murders and she starts to realize that the murders are connected to Jerry's ill-thought out plan.Despite opening with a disclaimer that this 'based on a true story', it's not really based on a true story, although it was loosely based on a real life case. But it perfectly sets the tone to the absurdity that is about to unfold. What the Coen Brothers do best is their perfect blend of dark humor, satire, and excessive violence and execute it in a flawless manner. You can't help but to laugh at all of the misfortunes that is happening to the characters, like Carl's short-tempered outbursts when something goes wrong or when Jerry is on the verge of having a nervous breakdown.I must say that I have to give huge props to the cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins. It gives it a seemly peaceful feeling of the snowy Minnesota countryside and the music gives it an old time folk feel that just fits perfectly to the setting. One of my favorite shots is that overhead shot of Jerry walking to his car in the snow-covered parking lot.The performances from the film's star-studded cast are all excellent. From William H. Macy as the timid Jerry, to Steve Buscemi as the loud, trash talking Carl Showalter, to even Peter Stormare as the emotionless and mostly mute Gaear Grimsrud. But the best of the cast is Francis McDormand as Marge. She's the only character out of all of them that is pleasant, whereas some of them, mainly the crooks, are crazy. She is seen as having a happy and modest life, has a loving and supporting husband, is witty, and, despite the situation that she's in and her life as a police chief, she still maintains her upbeat and 'Minnesota Nice' attitude.Overall, Fargo is a genuine classic that manages to rank up to masterpiece-level of quality. Certainly, one of the Coen Brothers' best films.Final Verdict: 10/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness",10,2,2,6 February 2019
Bird Box," A Decent Film, Just Don't Try This At Home
","So I was going through social media and I kept seeing people talking about this movie on Netflix called Bird Box and I was curious as to what this was all about considering the fact that this film inadvertently spawned an internet challenge where everyone is doing everyday things while blindfolded (yeah, I don't get it). So, after seeing people talk about it, I've decided to give this one a watch. Is this really worth the hype? Well, let's start with the plot.Sandra Bullock plays a mother named Malorie who, along with two children only referred to as Boy and Girl, must navigate through a forest and a dangerous river rapids completely blindfolded to reach a sanctuary while avoiding supernatural entities that, upon seeing them, will cause people to go insane and kill themselves. Much of the story is told through flashback beginning with entities' attack on humanity and a then-pregnant Malorie meets up with a group of survivors.Even though this was based on the novel of the same name, this movie very much reminds me of A Quiet Place, which is one of my favorite horror films in recent years. While it's similar in tone and atmosphere, this is more of an emotional story revolving around our main character having to deal with what's happening around her and reluctantly becoming the mother of two children in a post-apocalyptic environment. It does have some tense moments, but not as terrifying as A Quiet Place where you never know what will happen.The performances from the cast are pretty good, especially Sandra Bullock. Trevante Rhodes from Moonlight is also good as Tom, a strong-willed and likable character who is caring and helps Malorie through a dangerous and emotional time. John Malkovich plays the typical stubborn a**hole character found in any kind of horror film, but I find him kinda hilarious whenever he gets pissed drunk and start saying pessimistic remarks. But the real star is Sandra Bullock in probably one her best roles since Gravity.Overall, while it may be original pre se and it was a little bit overhyped, I genuinely enjoyed it for the most part, mainly due to the atmosphere and some solid performances. The one thing I found disappointing was that we never see what the monsters look like, where they came from, and how are they able to manipulate people into killing themselves. Also, some of the flashback scenes either don't make sense or tend to drag a little. I still prefer A Quiet Place to be the better film, but, as far as a movie with plenty of suspense and emotion, it's not too bad. Just don't do anything from this film, or in real life for that matter, blindfolded.Final Verdict: 7/10",7,0,3,10 January 2019
American Psycho," American Psycho Review - Money, Materialism, & Murder
","'I have to return some videotapes.' - Patrick BatemanYou know, I love horror films. Who doesn't? There's nothing more entertaining than turning the lights out at night and watching a good scary movie. But my favorite kind of horror is psychological horror. You see, with psychological horror it's not about a monster, a masked killer, or a zombie apocalypse, but it's about the fear and horror within yourself and it also explores what drives someone to kill. One film that manages to take that concept and mixes with satirical 80s black comedy and ending up being, for the most part, devilishly clever, insane, and hilarious at the same time is American Psycho.Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name, the story follows Patrick Bateman, who, by day he's a wealthy, but self-centered and materialistic stock broker in 1980s New York, but by night he's a bloodthirsty, psychopathic, and deranged serial killer who kills people to indulge his sadistic fantasies. But the line between reality and fantasy begin to blur as Patrick's dark side starts to reveal itself on his mask of seemingly outer perfection as his bloodlust rises.While it's not really a straight up horror film, it's more like a character study of someone who, on the surface, may seem like he's literally living the Dream and has a lavish lifestyle, but, in reality, he's a lunatic who craves murder, torture, and sex. This movie also satirizes the 80s Yuppies culture; young and wealthy people who work high-end jobs, have dinner at lavish restaurants, and pretty much say or do whatever they want without any sort of repercussions.However, it doesn't stray the focus away from the main character, thanks to its well-written screenplay. Much of the story is told from Patrick's point-of-view; he's obsessed with the lavish lifestyle; always trendy, always looking handsome, and living among the rich & elites, all this which hides his psychopathic dark side. But, at the same time, he despises it and often criticizes it for how shallow and soulless it can be, despite being obsessively indulged in it.I especially do like the look of the film and how it feels like the period that took place at the time. Cinematography is also on point here, especially viewing which side of Patrick we're seeing. It can be calm and soothing when he is normal, but then becomes crazy when he goes ballistic and starts killing people with an ax, a nail gun, and a chainsaw. Editing moves the film at a steady pace and the soundtrack cleverly fits with both the setting and events that unfold. You'll never hear the song 'Hip to Be Square' the same way again.Lastly, the performances; they all do their parts well, but it's Christian Bale who is the real star as Patrick Bateman. This was the film that made Bale into a household name, and this was before he was Batman in The Dark Knight Trilogy. It's amazing how committed an actor like Bale can be to match his physicality with the character's physical appearance as well as diving into the psyche of a psychopath.Overall, American Psycho is an interesting blend of comedy, horror, and satire that just works. The only thing that I didn't like too much was the third act, which I feel is when it started to decline a bit. But the humor, the satire of yuppies culture of the 80s, the excellent direction, and Bale's performance makes this an underrated gem. Defiantly worth watching.Final Verdict: 9/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness.Now if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videotapes.",9,1,1,12 February 2019
The Departed," The Departed Review
","'I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want the environment to be a product of me.' - Frank CostelloA remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, The Departed is once again yet another crime masterpiece that deals with identity and deception, and it's all done in such style that only Scorsese can pull off.Set in contemporary Boston, it follows Irish Mob boss Frank Costello who plants a mole within the Massachusetts State Police while, at the same time, the police sends an undercover cop to infiltrate Frank's organization. Eventually, both sides realizes what's going on and both moles race to identify each other before their covers are blown.In an age when remakes are often inferior to the original, there comes a remake where it takes the original concept and gives it its own unique style, and this is no exception. From its moving cameras, to its cinematography, Scorsese incorporates his own style into this film and gives it a gritty and tense feel to it. The editing, for the most part, moves at a steady and flowing pace, even if some moments where the editing moves frantically.The two major themes the movie deals with are identity and deception. Both moles are simultaneously trying to discover who each other are, but, at the same time, trying to blend into an environment they aren't originally from without revealing their true motives. It's also noted that both men, despite being different from each other, constantly competing in a similar manner is so clear and strong that it makes for some really intense moments.These intense and emotional moments wouldn't be possible without its star-studded cast, and each one delivers. Leonardo DiCaprio puts on a captivating performance as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon is great as Colin Sullivan, and, of course, Jack Nicholson, who might be the best performance in the movie, is outstanding as Frank Costello.Overall, The Departed is an excellent thriller. Emotionally gripping, thematic, and elegantly cinematic, it's one of Scorsese's best films and it's one of the best pieces of cinematic art.Final Verdict: 9/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness.",9,2,3,28 March 2019
Braveheart," Braveheart Review
","'They may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!' - William WallaceWhen it comes to movies that reach epic proportions and manages to surpass it to legendary status, one film personifies that, and that is Mel Gibson's Braveheart. From its production values, to its beautiful cinematography and excellent direction, this epic defiantly deserves a spot among cinema's greatest pieces of filmmaking.In 13th century Scotland, it tells the story of William Wallace, a Scotsman who, after witnessing his wife being publicly executed by the English, wages an all-out rebellion against the tyrannical English rule. Soon, his rebellion grows from a small group of farmers to, eventually, every clan in the country as he leads them to war for the freedom of Scotland.While, sure, it may not be entirely historically accurate, like the love connection between Wallace and Princess Isabella. But even with some of the historical inaccuracies, it doesn't get in the way of the overall narrative and spectacle. Gibson, who is also the director, shows off his cinematic vision with its authentic production design, gritty and dramatic tone, and sheer spectacle. I especially love the cinematography here, especially the sweeping shots of the Scottish landscape (even though some of the scenes are filmed in Ireland). For a film that is nearly 3 hours long, it felt like the movie had just the right amount of time, and that's mostly due to the film's steady pacing and good editing, especially the quick editing shots during the battle scenes.Speaking of which, the battle scenes are amazing. Right up there with Lord of the Rings, these are among the best battle scenes ever put to film. I'll never forget the Battle of Stirling Bridge scene (historical inaccuracies aside though) for being a brutal, bloody, and badass sword fight. You have heads being decapitated, blood splattering everywhere, impalements, people getting stabbed, people being set on fire, tortured, and getting shot by raining arrows; this is as brutal as medieval warfare could get. Lastly, the epic score done by the late James Horner is so good that it is the icing on the cake.The casting and performances are excellent: Brendon Gleeson, the late Patrick McGoohan, the gorgeous Sophie Marceau, among many others. But the real star is Mel Gibson, in probably one of his best, if not, his best performance, even better than Mad Max. He perfectly shows how any epic hero can be both badass and emotional at the same time.Overall, Braveheart is everything that I wanted in an epic film. A great story, phenomenal filmmaking, A-List performances, lush production values, and an epic score makes this a milestone in cinema history. After more than 20 years, it still stands as one of the best movies ever made. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? Go check it out.Final Verdict: 10/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness",10,3,4,30 January 2019
