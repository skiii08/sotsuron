First Man," Weird claustrophobic Camera Work
","If you like closeups you'll love First Man. Even though this is a movie about man's conquest of SPACE for Pete's sake, the director (La La Land) focuses the camera largely on closeups of the actors. It's a low-budget device to spare what was really needed here -- COMPUTER GRAPHICS! Instead it's way too soapy, never fully revealing its stoic but courageous hero, Neil Armstrong. What a missed opportunity!",3,5,8,26 January 2019
War Machine," Instead See Kubruck's DR. STRANGELOVE
","There are definitely some good laughs in here grounded in our well-known but sad history in Vietnam and Iran. This Netflix movie takes place in Afghanistan with none other than Brad Putt as the commanding general, full of himself. The general is patterned after a Westmoreland-type character who thinks that the sheer power of his charisma will win the day. We then see how badly this approach works in the Mideast, where true leadership among the natives is simply nonexistent (Ben Kingsley plays an Afghan leader more concerned with his new TV and remaining unavailable than he does leading his country). This movie asks the question: If the natives won't even support their own leader, how are they going to follow an American General? There's no action in this movie, so it's basically a personality driven comedy. In Kubrick's STRANGELOVE, there's a better balance of suspense, action, and comedic personalities. See it instead if you want to see a movie about the futility of war and the dangers of placing too much power in the hands of the military.",4,6,10,30 May 2017
Mother!," SHAMEFUL WASTE
","After wrapping this flick, Jennifer Lawrence has to be saying 'what was I thinking?' 90% of this particular movie is fixed either on her face or the back of her head, all with a handheld camera. How fun is that? You'll end the movie carsick.Lawrence has the unenviable task of looking perplexed, surprised, and disgusted at the constant arrival of unwanted guests in her remodeled Victorian. You'll feel like you're watching Chevy's CHRISTMAS VACATION without the humor. MOTHER! is a frustrating and unceremonious examination of weird house guests, including Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, who simply want a place to rest their head. Is that tedious? You bet.Why does Lawrence's husband, Javier Bardem, entertain and house these guests against her wishes? Frankly, like Rhett Butler, we don't give a hoot. The movie will find you taking deep breaths, not from shock or dismay, but sheer boredom or anger at the appalling insensitivity of Bardem to his wife Lawrence. Perhaps if Bardem reprised his Oscar-winning role as serial killer Anton Chigurh, our 2 hours of this misery might be justified. Didn't happen.For two hours I thought I was watching a new 'hip' version of ROSEMARY'S BABY, but that didn't happen either. Instead, there is no real closure to this movie and we find that Lawrence has been a simple chess piece in a loop of never-ending abuse. If you really LIKED this movie, you need therapy. It's really painful to watch.Aronofsky, the Director, likes to throw spaghetti on the wall hoping that enough critics will see the Mona Lisa there somewhere. I suppose if you put 1000 monkeys in a room with 1000 typewriters they will eventually come up with GONE WITH THE WIND. But this strategy, like Aronofsky's strategy, means that audiences will have to figure out just what he's pitching to us on his way to stardom. I don't want to take that train. It's a very bumpy trip.My fellow critics have asked the same question: What exactly is the theme of MOTHER!? Perhaps it's a biblical allegory? Or perhaps it's a protest piece from the misogyny suffered by women? Or perhaps it's a statement about the failure of the world to address homelessness? Or the trials of remodeling your Victorian? Take your pick. It's a bunch of spaghetti on the wall.Skip it and watch ROSEMARY'S BABY, a classic horror flick with a great director, Roman Polanski. It has a shocking finale but it least it has closure. MOTHER! is so darn vague, it's plot so loose, that it would make a great dribble painting by Jackson Pollock. Don't subject yourself to this cinematic nonsense by Aronofsky. If you paid good money to see this, ask for a refund. I gave it 2 stars because I liked the brief visuals of the Canadian countryside where this was filmed.Jennifer, you need a new agent!",2,8,12,27 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," An Unwanted Alien History Lesson
","Ridley, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? We all realize that coming up with a 'new' alien movie is a challenge, but why clutter up your successful franchise with such a messy, confusing, and unwanted plot. Does the audience really care WHERE these aliens originated? Do we want to see their gory planet? This movie and Prometheus were valiant but unsuccessful in furnishing us information we could care less about. The recent LIFE movie with Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds got back to the basics and scared the dickens out of us. Ridley, do the same. Get it back to the chase between humans and aliens in a confined environment which is plenty suspenseful without the distractions of sitting through ALIEN ANTHROPOLOGY 101. It's plain old boring. And one more thing: All the alien movies end somehow with an ironic but predictable 'twist'. The audience knows it's coming and smells it a mile away -- namely the aliens, though defeated by humans, will ultimately conquer earth. LIFE with Jake and Ryan was no different. Give us a happy ending please.. we really are angry about seeing so much ugly death and destruction, only to see the battle-worn victors vanquished by the stupid aliens. Just kill the darn things will you please? The human race is already in jeopardy, so give us something different.",4,5,11,24 May 2017
