Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Disrespectful
","This movie shows the world that America doesn't care about their history, not only did they disrespect Abe Lincoln but destroyed his life story w/ a horrible fictional film. Abe was a hero 2 America & seeing this film made me feel ashamed 2 be part of this country, 2 the actors, story writers, directors, producers & rest of the film crew u wasted months of your life creating this monstrosity & May god & Abe Lincoln 4give u. I hope nothing like this ever happens again. 2 those who actually loved & enjoyed this film R completely insane, & also have no respect 2 your own country. We R suppose 2 be the United States of America & I think the people of this country needs 2 start letting history become us instead of destroying it & trashing it.",1,0,3,10 April 2014
The Shape of Water," A Bit Surprised
","I'm a sucker for romance films with happy endings, a big big fan, but I must rash out against, 'The Shape Of Water.' The actors, directors everyone who worked on this film really did a great job. And don't get me started on forbidden love stories, I absolutely love them. But my issues with this movie are being a little grossed out when Sally Hawkins masturbates in the bathtub.. 'Really guys, that scene was a MUST, it couldn't of been edited out..?' 'Or even shot differently, like a close up of her face whilst she's in the bathtub that would imply what she is doing.' I do understand the 'Point' the film is trying to make, she fell in love with him because she saw him as a loving kind gentle sole, his appearance & species didn't matter, & he fell in love with her for the same reasons as she did, but showing the 2 making love, again was kind of gross, usually after watching a forbidden romance movie, I gush over the leading male role. But there isn't going to be any #TeamTunaMan.. I certainly don't agree with IMDB's rating of 7.7/10 or it's 13 nominations...",4,5,9,3 March 2018
