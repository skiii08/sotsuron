Lucky Number Slevin," One of those great movies no one ever saw
","I remember I saw this movie just by chance: Went to cinema, nothing to watch... Well this have great actors in it, let's see what it is about... I was not only not disappointed, it blew my mind!Lucky Number Slevin has all the ingredients that a movie needs to make a great action movie! Great actors? Check! Complex, yet totally understandable plot? Check! A few twist along the way? Check! Funny moments all along? Check! An astonishing art direction? Check! That awesome felling that you are missing something no matter how much attention you are paying to the movie? Dobule check!!The movie is catching since the first 10 minutes, when Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) gets introduced. From then on, there is no idle moment on the film. You get quickly introduced to Josh Hartnet's character, a Mr. Nobody that is mistaken for someone else and ends up owing favors for two big and confronted Mafia bosses (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). In the next minutes, we found out that this seems to be Mr. Goodkat's plan from the beginning. And now I'll stop!If you are a fan of action/adventure films BUT you NEED a good plot, this movie is for you! And also, it's very funny!Enjoy!",9,1,3,2 January 2015
