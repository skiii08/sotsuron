The Rock," THE ROCK. The best film ever made!
","Forget Titanic, The silence of the Lambs and Seven. THE ROCK IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE! Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage performs a fantastic appearance, and the plot is really good. The nerve in this film will nail you to your armchair. This is one of the few films I can watch again and again and again. If you haven't seen it before, go get it now. YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE IT !",10,2,3,5 March 1999
Happy Gilmore," Funniest movie ever?
","Happy Gilmore is the funniest film I have ever seen. I laughed so much I couldn`t breathe. It is a hundred times as funny as Dumb and Dumber, and ten times as funny as Ace Ventura, and that says it all. Adam Sandler is just perfect in the role as Happy Gilmore and you will laugh from beginning to end. PS:See it together with someone. It`s funniest that way.",10,3,3,7 March 1999
The Usual Suspects," Genius!
","After The Rock, This is the best movie I have ever seen, and it certainly deserves its place in the top 250 ranking. The plot is absolutely wonderful, and Kevin Spacey`s achievements in this movie rightfully gave him an Academy award. The ending of this movie is genius, and you will be extremely surprised when you see who Keyser Soze really is. You have to see this movie. It is a piece of fine art.",10,0,1,8 March 1999
Jurassic Park," It works if You are a ten-year-old dino-freak
","All right. I must admit that this movie has got some nice special-effects, but that`s also all it has got. Sam Neill and Laura Dern give an OK performance.Conclusion: It works if you are a ten-year-old dino-freak.",3,4,22,8 March 1999
