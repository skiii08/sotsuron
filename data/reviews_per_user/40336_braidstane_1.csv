Ghost," Boy loves girl but dies ... but doesn't leave until he heroically saves her life from the bad guys who killed him.
","It had been a long time since I had watched this movie when I first put a vote in. I had the opportunity to watch it again today and changed my rating upwards.The angels coming from heaven and the demons coming from hell might be a little hokey but it gets the idea across. All the actors did an excellent job on this story including instantaneous reactions to supernatural events which overtake them suddenly. This movie is not just Patrick Swayze candy. (The more I see his acting, the better developed are his acting skills. He grows with each part and is way past the 'bouncer, dancer, guy from the wrong side of the road, etc.) He does seem to be working on his craft even though the stories of his personal road of life have not portrayed an easy time.Whoopi continues to delight me. I become a bigger fan of her talent and her humanity every day.Demi also continues to grow with every picture although my two favorites still remain 'G.I.Jane' and 'A Few Good Men'. Maybe she just looks good in uniform --- and I am a 56 year old woman married for 33 years --- don't let your imagination take you to wrong places. Having wanted to be in the military myself in younger days, she epitomizes to me how a young woman officer should handle herself while dealing with the difficulty of proving herself worthy every day to wear the uniform. Yeah---I think it is an honorable estate to serve this country and not every one is capable of making the grade! So much on those thoughts!!! All in all, 'Ghost' is romantic, funny, suspenseful, and a good movie for a Saturday night!",9,3,5,3 April 2005
