"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," An American sitcom in a 'British' feature film's body
","My friend and I went into this with somewhat high expectations, and unfortunately we were both fairly disappointed. At first I thought that describing the movie as 'sitcomish' would be too obvious and simplistic, especially given the fact that David 'Ross from 'Friends'' Schwimmer directed it.But no, that's EXACTLY what is it. The pacing, the comedic beats, the characters...it all comes off like an American network TV half-hour sitcom transported into an-hour-and-forty-minute movie's body and randomly thrown onto the streets of London.(I read an article on the movie and Schwimmer that said it was originally set in New York City...but when the bulk of the film financing ended up coming from England, the money people insisted it be a London story with mostly U.K. actors.) The biggest problem with the movie is that it is SO predictable. Very early in the film you know what is going to happen, and what each of the main characters is going to do. And sure enough, the movie plays out that way with no variation at all. Moreover, it feels like the plot and the characters are being forced into following the template laid out for them. When Thandie Newton's character makes the decisions she does late in the film (especially as it pertains to Simon Pegg's character), they don't feel like natural decisions. It's like she does what she does because the script says she has to. When Hank Azaria's character is revealed to be the type of person he is...well, I'd like to sell a bridge in Brooklyn to whoever didn't see that coming. And no, I don't blame any of this on the acting. It's the material and the direction.I said to my friend, 'If this film had come out in the 1980's, it would be a lot funnier and feel somewhat fresh.' She said that sums up how she feels about the movie.The film has its moments. Dylan Moran as best friend Gordon is the best thing going. Thandie Newton is solid and charming. Harish Patel takes what could have easily been a typical Indian stereotype and turns it into a fun and likable character. On the other hand... Simon Pegg is someone I like. But he appears to be reaching that Steve Carell-stage where he does the same shtick in every movie. Hank Azaria is also someone I generally like, but here he feels very much out of place. (And no, not because his character is an American in London.) Basically, I think this is the kind of movie that's good for watching on cable TV on a lazy Saturday/Sunday when a mediocre, unnotable film is just what you need for comfort.",4,2,7,29 March 2008
