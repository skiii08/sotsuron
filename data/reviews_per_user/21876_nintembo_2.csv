Scarface," Classic film IMO
",Upon purchasing the Scarface gift set - I am taking it upon myself to jot down only a quick review - reason being is that what can I say about this awesome film which hasn't been said before? I think Al Pacino should have got an Oscar for this film (Thinking about what he DID get one for makes me shudder) Brian DePalmer is definitely one of my favrioute directors and this film rates IMO as his second best (Just behind the Untouchables) I also feel that the Scarface script is Oliver Stones best work - I love the way he subed the 1930's gold with the 1980's 'Gold' of cocaine - with just a hint of a political statement (see the bath tub scene ; ))All in all - If you haven't seen this film you are missing out BIG TIME! It is a rarity that a remake bests the original!,Null,0,1,26 October 2004
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Awesome
","Wow, what a beautiful film! A stunning treat for the whole family! I can't begin to imagine the creative process involved to create such a visually pleasing world! Tim Burtons shadow casts over this film in the beautifully quirky shades also seen in 'Edward Sissor Hands' and more recently 'Big Fish' The cast voices are captured superbly and the musical score is something to behold!In regards to musical composition - this is as equally brilliant a film (as it is visually) If you have seen this movie I can only recommend you see it again asI can gaurntee there will be something new to catch on repeat viewing!",Null,0,1,7 December 2004
