Hereditary," Expected a lot more
","I had such high expectations for this movie. I love horror/scary movies. I love Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne. Not in this though. Collette overacted. Byrne underacted. I hope this was intended. The ending was so disappointing. There was absolute silence in the cinema as the end credits rolled. I exchanged glances will a few other movie goes which said What did we just see? Without giving away specific spoilers, there were too many unexplained situations. One spoiler - if your sister is killed whilst under your supervision, do you just drive home and let your mother find what is left of her body, and then not be held accountable for any of it at all?? If you see it, don't pay for the experience.",2,2,4,18 July 2018
Sinister," A very clever idea
","For me, this is my favourite scary/horror movie. The story is clever, and revealed at a good pace. A couple of good scares at the beginning to get you in and then the story unfolds. The ending, for me, was unexpected. Other reviews have revealed the plot so all I can say is, if you want to see something different in the genre, see this. Don't confuse it with the sequel though.",8,0,0,18 July 2018
