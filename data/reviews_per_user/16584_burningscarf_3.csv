Kill Bill: Vol. 2," the good and the true
","The writing is  fresh, well conceived, and engaging.  (The Superman monologue and the flapping-fish metaphor are core achievements in writing that will resonate for a long time.)  Robert Richardson's  cinematography is beautiful.   Compostitionally captivating.  Thanks to the writing, I've never seen a more evil and likable villain.  Caradine should be remembered for this performance.  Thurman shines as well.   Budd doesn't put up a fight when his titty-bar boss verbally pistol whips him, yet he proves to be a scary assassin.  Perla Haney-Jardine sets an unprecedented standard for child acting.   There are many good things to see here.",Null,0,1,30 April 2004
Unbreakable," A Rewarding Experience
","M. Night Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' presents a stylistic and satisfying portrayal of the birth of a hero. The hero's gradual awareness and understanding of his capabilities is enjoyable to say the least. Minimal dialogue and effective gestures convey a sense of sophistication and subtlety, and the camera direction provides a seemingly simple yet intricate atmosphere. The underlying direness of the story and the hero's transcending qualities coalesce to create a beautiful and fulfilling story. Although truly horrifying at times, this film offers a sense of hope and encouragement. 'Unbreakable' proves that finding strength and potential within the outwardly mundane is a rewarding experience.",Null,0,0,13 July 2002
Signs," Wholesome Sci-Fi
","Someone [Manoj Â‘Night' Shyamalan] finally made a wholesome science fiction film. `Signs' is the ultimate contradiction to the lame and flimsy `Independence Day.' Shyamalan realizes that emotions are so much more effective than explosions. `Signs' is 'the' most convincing and freaky depiction of an alien invasion that I have ever seen. There are no laser guns, no mind reading, and no bull. There are just real people, like you and I, with real emotions.",8,0,1,4 August 2002
