The Ring," Garbage compared to the original
","What a dissapointement...Good beginning looked alot same as the original and then we get to see the video, my my my where why did he destroy the very grim one from the original and make this stupid piece with to many explains... Also i did a test i have the original and saw it long before this one, so now saw the new US version (lol didn't scare me 1 second) and when i got home i putted the original in my tapeplayer again thinking this time the original wouldn't scare me, well euhhh it did, the way the things are filmed, putted in screen, the lights the little video frames puts you in sort of uncomfortable way. Also they mix something up here in the originalk she does alot to save not her but her SON! Here in this one her son seems more like a devil part that knows more then he should now a bit looking like 'the Sixth sense' what has absolutly nothing to do with it.Anyway nice try on the remake, but the scary scenes from the original are completly taken away, not frightening, a new version of the tape completly missed and some other errors.You gave it a 10 go see the original and you gone reset your points. Only thing i wait is 'The Ring 2' the sequel of the original made by the same original screenwriter and director.Oh by the way i really wanted to say Well done lately to the japanese Movies because they teaching some directing arts to the US that seem lost lately to find a good scenario. Lately japan hits hard on good movies like 'Battle Royale' in case you didn't see get it you will be amazed.",3,0,0,14 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Boring Movies lately
","As a big movie fan, i go to the movies 1-2 times a week, and lately i don't know what is wrong but the movies are little boring and empty, Here in Belgium Star Wars came out 2 days ago, and like there was nothing much left to see i went to Star Wars, even if i am not a really fan of this, i go to see them to have my own opinion and perhaps because everyone talks so much about the Star Wars Trilogy lately, just like last year, and wow how disappointing, the talk is for kids of 12 years old, the Special effect are Ok sometimes but mostly completely missed in some places, when i compare to older movie, like terminator II that is about 6-7 years old if i am not wrong, then Star Wars is far behind. Even the acting is not that great to be honest, and it is sad to see that this movie get's good scores only because it is called STAR WARS! If it was called something like Space Wars and was not from Lucas, most of you would say it is not worth Star Wars and give it a 3/10 rating or something, every one is free to be fan of something i agree but really try to open your eyes and be a bit realistic.As i said before i am a big movie fan and movies are quite boring, like Beautiful Mind, Charlotte Gray, and some other but at least the acting is great, the only Top movie that i saw lately is Panic Room, if you didn't see it you really have to, and you will see that you will get much more from Panic room (with the excellent performance of Jodie Foster) then Star Wars : Attack of the Clones.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
