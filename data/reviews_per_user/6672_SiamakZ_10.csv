Requiem for a Dream," A disturbing and striking movie about addiction, not just for drugs, but food as well.
","(unrated version)We meet Harry, a young and ambitious guy, who keeps on stealing and pawning his mother's television set to earn some quick cash. With that cash he and his buddy Tyrone score some drugs. And pretty soon also his love interest, the beautiful Marion, gets involved. On the other hand Harold's mother, Sara Goldfarb, is hooked to her television and keeps rebuying it back from the pawn shop. In fact, she's so obsessed with the television, she would do anything to appear on stage in her beautiful red dress. But in order to fit her dress, she's to lose a lot of weight. On the advice of her 'friends' she tries a diet first, but pretty soon she turns to colorful pills, prescribed by a doctor. Not only does she lose weight, but also her mind. Not only because of the pills, but first and foremost because of the sugar withdrawal. And little by little we witness her downfall into isolation and hallucinations. Aronofsky uses multiple techniques very effectively. Using close-ups in fast-motion he shows images of drugs, be it pills, coke or heroin. Then the way it's administered, be it swallowing, sniffing or injecting. And finally the dilatation of the user's pupils. It's all done very fast and loud, just like a quick fix. Furthermore he uses split-screen and headshots to really put the focus on the characters and their expressions. And as if that's not enough, some top-down views seal the deal. Another special treat is the score by Clint Mansell. His soundtrack is just unforgettable. It gives chills down your spine every time you hear it. And since it's been used many times in different movie trailers, commercials etc, you probably have heard it a lot. The performances of the actors are great as well. Not once does it feel like acting, it seems as if they've been using drugs for real. And as the story unfolds, their desperate destinations come closer inevitably. As a viewer you'll be touched and have a hard time not feeling sorry for them. Rating: R/16",Null,0,0,29 July 2011
Sucker Punch," Too much eye candy and too little focus on the story itself
","For this review, I've watched the extended edition. Snyder's put too much emphasis on visuals and over the top action scenes... Although the story is nice to begin with, after a while it seems the whole quest and fantasies are taking over. The first time it's kinda fresh and exciting, but it grows old real fast. Snyder has borrowed heavily from other sources, such as Killzone. Actually, the whole movie plays like a watered-down video game. But just like the girls in teeny skirts, it's all eye candy and very superficial. I had high hopes for this movie, especially being a fan of Snyder's previous work (300 and Watchmen). But unfortunately, this one falls short and gets the stamp mindless action flick.",Null,0,3,16 July 2011
Source Code," Relive the last 8 minutes and make it count!
","Imagine you've 8 minutes to save the world. Imagine waking up in a train, inside a stranger's body, sitting opposite a beautiful woman, and still having 8 minutes before the train explodes. And now imagine being able to relive these 8 final minutes over and over until you figure out who's the bomber and how to stop him. That's basically the whole story of Source Code. But of course it takes more time to show the audience these trials. The story is puzzling, certainly in the beginning and gives your brain a nice exercise. And although somewhat predictable, it's still good entertainment value and is recommended!R: PG-13 or 12 (NL)",Null,0,1,30 July 2011
My Neighbor Totoro," An inspiring and carefree adventure
","A wonderful Japanese anime about two little girls and their coping with the sickness of their mother. Through letting loose their imagination and crawling through the rabbit hole, they discover a magnificent world. But unlike Alice in Wonderland, there's no evil in their world. Only totoros, spirit-like creatures only visible in the eyes of lucky children. The parents of the girls listen to their kids and don't accuse them of lying. They actually do the contrary and encourage them to have a vivid imagination. This is probably the best message for young children. Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli present a classic but colorful world with great details. It's a treat for the beholders. Despite the fact the movie is made in 1988, it's still a joy to see. It's a great family film and highly recommended for all ages.",Null,0,1,25 July 2011
Forrest Gump," Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get
","With this wisdom the movie takes off and Forrest Gump introduces himself. He tells his life story to anyone who wants to hear it. And what a story it is. Although simple-minded, following the advice of his mother and childhood friend Jenny, Forrest gets places. His mother tells him he's the same as everyone else, and no different at all. And she makes sure he goes to a regular school, no matter what it takes. And on the school bus he meets his one and only girlfriend, Jenny. Together they're like peas and carrots. She tells him that whenever he's in trouble, he should run away. And she cheers him shouting 'Run, Forrest, run!'. He can run like the wind blows. It literally takes him anywhere. During his travels, he also meets up with various interesting people and gets involved in American history in the making. Tom Hanks puts up a great performance and definitely pulls it off with flying colors. Robert Zemeckis, is a master of special effects, and uses it very effectively to include Forrest Gump into historical events. In the end, it's a wonderful and inspiring movie. Highly recommended.

Grave of the Fireflies," A touching and sad story about survival during wartime
","(ENG dub, ENG sub)The story is about two young children; Seita, a young teenager, and his little sister Setsuko, around 4. Due to air raids their village gets burned down and they've to abandon their house. With their mother soon passing away because of heavy burns and their father in the navy, the two become orphans. They move in with their aunt, who rather soon starts to act cruel and give them less and less food. Being unwelcome and criticized, Seita decided to move once more and they choose the caves on the hills as their new house. There, they enjoy the light of the fireflies. But as the war continues, food becomes scarce. Pure out of desperation to feed Setsuko and himself, Seita starts stealing crops. But unfortunately the health of Setsuko is deteriorating fast due to malnutrition. Her smiles and laughs are gone; instead she becomes more and more quietThe emotional story unfolds itself very slowly. A lot of effort is put in the seemingly unimportant events, which gives the characters more depth. It's great to see how Seita copes with the situation at hand. He has to be strong, not only for himself, but also for Setsuko. It's rare to see so much beauty in an animation. There are some breathtaking and dramatic scenes, which I won't spoil of course. It's safe to say, this animated movie will move you, it's that real!My score: 9 out of 10 My rating: PG or 6 (NL)",9,0,1,1 August 2011
Groundhog Day," Carpe diem, seize the day, pluk de dag!
","What a wonderful movie This movie shows that no matter how boring and monotonous a day is, you should try to make the best out of it. Even if that means reliving the same cold winter day over and over again. That's what happens to the egocentric weather reporter Phil, who travels to the little picturesque town of Punxsutawney, where the annual Groundhog Day is celebrated. He finds himself trapped in a weird cycle: every morning he wakes up on the same day! But he's the only one who relives the day, for the rest it's all new. Little by little he learns about all the people; who they are, what they do, what makes them tick... At first, he uses this information to his benefit, thinking he can get away with anything, since nothing has consequences he reckons. He lives like there's no tomorrow, which is actually true. Using trial & error he gets almost everything he wants, except for one thing: the affection of his producer Rita. No matter how hard he tries, she won't give in... Disappointed by this failure Phil take another route, which leads to his self-destruction time after time. When and how will he find his redemption?",9,1,2,14 August 2011
Rango," Rango is a smart animated comedy, great for young & old!
","Rango is a smart animated comedy, great for young & old! It has a lot of references to other movies, with the Hawaiian shirt Rango's wearing straight from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Visually brilliant, almost Pixar-esque. Proves 2D is still relevant. Really amazing shots, with time-lapses, motion blur and more... Great voice-cast & dialogue, with Johnny Depp as the main act. Great use of sound, especially with the classics Ride of the Valkyries & The Blue Danube combined with great western music. The story is nice, although pretty typical for a western. But at least it reaches a new and young audience. Highly recommended, much better than the pile of sequels nowadays, also in animation. Rating: PG / 6",8,1,3,11 July 2011
Raging Bull," Masterpiece about the physical strength but mental weakness of (some) men
","Robert De Niro & Martin Scorsese are a brilliant duo, and this might be their best collaboration! De Niro portrays Jake LaMotta, a raging and self-destructive boxer, hence his nickname 'The Raging Bull'. But actually the film isn't about boxing, that's just the setting. The real themes are paranoia and jealousy; about how a man desires a beautiful woman at first, but due to insecurity loses his touch with reality and dwells into mistrusting every move she makes. Freud called it the Madonna-whore complex, look it up ;) The performances are great, and De Niro rightfully received an Oscar for best actor. During this movie he transforms from a fit young prizefighter to an overweight retired old man, gaining an astounding 33 kg! But everything is right in this movie; the directing, the editing, the use of black & white, the camera-work, the supporting actors. Without a doubt a Great Movie and one of the best of the '80. My score: 9.5 out of 10 Rating: R / Kijkwijzer: 16",9,1,2,7 January 2012
The Fighter," A true story. About the 'comeback' of a local boxer, and his little brother, who's an upcoming boxer himself.
","Micky, the younger of two, keeps it all in the family. His brother Dicky, former boxer, and a regular at the crack house, is his coach. And Alice, his mother of nine, is his manager. Dicky is lost between his comeback and his addiction, confusing the one for another. Micky, on the other hand, is too afraid to disappoint his family and takes punches for them, literally. Not until he meets Charlene, a former college drop-out, who works at the local bar, he starts to realize he should start to think different. The story is a mix of multiple stories. First you got the expected Rocky-like story about a hero falling down, and rising out the ashes again. But more interesting and relevant, it's also the story about the effects of an addiction. Christian Bale proves once again he's a versatile actor. His portrayal of Dicky is engaging and doesn't look like acting. And finally, there's the tale of ma Alice, trying to run the dysfunctional family. Her two boys are fighters, while her seven daughters are like a pack of sheep, superficial and bleating all the time. Melissa Leo, really nails the role. It's a delight to see her, so full of passion. Just for these dramatic stories and their depictions, it's an entertaining movie and recommended. Rating: R (restricted) / 16",7,0,0,12 July 2011
