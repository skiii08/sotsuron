Raiders of the Lost Ark," A comic strip allegory
","This is a comic strip movie for viewers who are kids at heart--- those who recognize it for what it is, and are willing to suspend disbelief without a second thought.The sequences for the Map Room and the Well of Souls are Super!! And, the sets are MAGNIFICENT!!The sequence when Belloq opens the Ark, and fire consumes him and the other servants of evil and burns the bonds from Indy and Marion---I consider to be an allegoryI was massively p****d when Karen Allen wasn't cast in the 2nd 'Indy' movie (Temple of Doom), which, by the way I thought was a 'pukey' film.",10,0,0,25 June 1999
Elizabeth," How did this film get into Oscar contention anyway???
","The director of this film didn't know how to tell a story.  The average viewer (I'm below average) desperately needed a narrator to fill them in on the English, French, and Spanish history, politics, and religion of those fascinating and turbulent times. What kind of claim did Mary Queen of Scots have to the English throne:  blood, politics, or religion???  Too many DARKLY LIGHTED scenes.  How did this film get into Oscar contention??? I noted that Joseph Fiennes was a busy boy what with roles in Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth in roughly the same time period.",5,2,3,29 April 1999
The Mummy," Fascinating bad guys and magnificent movie sets!!!
","Loved the movie.  Lots of 'old friends' in it:  Brendan Fraser from George of the Jungle, Rachel Weisz from Chain Reaction, John Hannah from Four Weddings and a Funeral, Kevin J. O'Connor from Peggy Sue Got Married, and Jonathan Hyde from Jumanji.The Egyptian movie sets are magnificent;  the Mummy and his bony associates are fascinating.  The computer graphics are neat.  The plot logic got me a little confused---but I hope to straighten that out the next time I see the movie.Rachel Weisz is a little cutie and really fits her part.",8,0,0,10 June 1999
Notting Hill," Disappointing and not funny
","I saw Notting Hill yesterday and was quite disappointed.  When beautiful, rich, famous Anna Scott plants a sexy smooch on William without hardly knowing him---I said 'WHOA !!'.  And the movie went downhill from there. And where did 'they' dredge up that bunch of DORKS as the supporting cast??? Funny it was not. Slightly paraphrasing words from a long ago radio show: T'weren't funny McGee.'  Up to now I've been a Julia Roberts fan.  Loved her in Pretty Woman.  And she wasn't bad in Steel Magnolias.  However, I intend to pass on Runaway Bride until I can rent it for 45Â¢.",6,0,0,12 August 1999
The Thin Red Line," NOT up to Saving Private Ryan
","This movie was too moody and introspective about the conduct of war, and becomes draggy and boring.  It concentrates  too much upon showing the fear of the men---yes, there is FEAR, but the vast majority of soldiers go on. And, from time to time, the movie degenerates into a travelogue.  The Director was going wild with imagery.  Basically, The Thin Red Line isn't a patch on Saving Private Ryan.",5,0,1,31 August 1999
