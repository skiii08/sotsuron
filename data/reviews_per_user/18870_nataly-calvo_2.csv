Ali," Ali-is it about Ali?
","In this film there is definitely an emphasis on the civil rights movements occurring in both the United States as well in the other countries he visits. In fact the movie doesn't focus on his boxing career, but rather the way he stood as a symbol of resistance to lack oppression. As a character he is actually portrayed as arrogant, irresponsible and rash. Furthermore throughout the movie there is not much character growth. And contrary to this depiction of Ali in his personal life and manner of speaking, the public has taken him in as a symbol of hope. When he refuses to join the army for 'people who wont even defend me here, in America,' riots erupt. And when he visits Jamaica, it becomes apparent how his success in the boxing career has had an influence in the village population. They see him as someone who is standing up to their rights by consistently talking up his rights on national TV before and after his fights. In reality, other than talking up a big talk, he doesn't act in any way to bring rights to the general black people. In a way his actions can even be interpreted as counterproductive for the civil rights movement: his rude behavior in interviews and ruffling with the police and multiple marriages represents negative attributes that could be misconstrued to reflect the attributes of the African American population.",8,1,2,22 August 2014
Drive," You Make Me A Real Human Being
","Reading the reviews on this film, specifically those centered on analysis of symbols, a lot of attention has been given to the scorpion jacket he wears throughout the film and its connection to the story of the scorpion and the frog, which ultimately proves to be the plot of the story. However, not much analysis has been given to the mask he wears at the beginning-when he's performing the car stunt- and the end of the movie -when he murders Nino-. And the best way to understand the mask is to listen to the music given when he meets Irene-A Real Human Being by Nightcall. This song is played all through the creek scene and most of the time he spends with Irene before Gabriel comes back. The mask is obviously a synthetic object and his wearing of it in the beginning and end of the movie show his lack of real life. He's in this own world of his without a family or any past (that were told of) or relations, he simply Drives. And in the end when he puts the mask back on to save Irene and her son, he makes that decision to not have a life again, and possibly give everything up for the rest of his life. When he drives off clean from the deal after leaving the money next to the corpse of Bernie, A Real Human Being and A Real Human plays again, hinting that he will be able to make a life for himself and he isn't stuck in his synthetic mask.",10,3,5,30 August 2014
