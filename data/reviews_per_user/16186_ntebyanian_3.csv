Raiders of the Lost Ark," On my top ten and always will be!
","I've been a fan of Steven Spielberg since i can remember.I mean i grew up with the guy starting off with E.T. ,then onto Jurassic park,close encounters,jaws and so on.But it was until later i came across Indiana Jones or should i say Raiders of the lost ark.This movie not only is my favorite Spielberg movie but also my favorite adventure film! It's pure Spielberg magic from beginning to end with so many memorable moments!It has everything from action scenes to a little romance,funny moments and some scary sequences! It has it all and is made so well to with an Awesome performance by Harrison Ford(Han Solo) :). This film is one badass ride in a nutshell that anyone who loves fun,exciting,adventure films surely can't miss this one! Temple of Doom and The last Crusade (the sequels) are great as well,but not like this one!10 out of 10",10,1,2,24 March 2012
The Hunger Games," Disappointed.....
","I recently read the Hunger Games and i automatically became hooked. The story,the characters,everything which gives the reader so much to think about.I was honestly pretty excited to see this movie,but i told myself not to have high expectations and in the end i'm glad i listened. Now i do have to say the first half starts out promising.We come across the character of Katniss Everdeen as she gets prepared for the yearly reaping of two children,a boy and a girl from each district to battle to the death. This half was good and i did fell tension between a lot of the characters and i liked that. But the second half when the games actually begin,i found myself starting to realize a lot of changes!They took out a lot of things i quickly noticed while i was watching.People said they made minor changes,but i think their were major changes.From taking a part out or just adding in an extra scene made me feel like it could have been executed better.Occasionally it worked but overall it kinda ruined it. So the bottom line is i give it a thumbs up to the look of the movie,which pretty much covers all the details in the book,capturing the capitol city wonderfully. Also a thumbs up to Jennifer Lawerence,Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci for their fine performances. Thumbs down for the lack of details i wanted to see,lack of acting for certain people (Josh Hutcherson) and the last half of the film which to me seemed kind of anti climatic. Also i didn't like Ross's camera work in this movie for one reason.The majority of fight scenes were all done hand held and it really ruins the action.5 out of 10.",5,16,28,24 March 2012
The Godfather," My Favorite Film of all time.
","I just created an account and knew i had to review this movie first.The Godfather is easily the most impressive movie because of the following: The directing is top notch,Coppola reveals his first masterpiece within an instant. The cast is Probably the best iv'e ever seen,which includes Brando,Pacino,Duvall,Caan,Keaton and many,many other great actors/actresses.The screenplay is very faithful to the book,proving adaptations can be perfect.Most of all the story itself,which for me never get boring to watch.Their really isn't a straight path story here,we have a movie that represents life in the 1940's as the crime families from each district confront their differences leading to a bunch of events that i won't get into. Overall this movie amazes me every time and iv'e seen at least a dozen times,each time better than the last. I have to give a personal thank you to Al Pacino,who is easily my favorite actor delivers one of the best performances to date.I cannot emphasize enough how perfect Al was for this role. To think they actually doubted him at first,wow just imagine him not in this movie is beyond me.I love this movie half to death,if you haven't seen it and are a movie lover like i am you definitely need to Netflix/Buy this movie!!!!10/10",10,0,2,23 March 2012
