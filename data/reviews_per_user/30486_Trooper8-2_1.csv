The Blair Witch Project," A creepy and excellent movie
","Simply put, this is not the scariest movie ever made.  I was hardly frightened out of my wits while watching it.  It did, however, create a truly creepy atmosphere, which is something few so-called horror movies ever do.  I really enjoyed this movie very much, even the parts that weren't at all creepy were very interesting and entertaining to me.  There is no doubt that a lot of people aren't going to like this movie, however.  I work at a movie theater and have talked to plenty of moviegoers who were disappointed. I have also talked to plenty who loved it as much as I did.  I would advise that you don't listen to what anybody else says and go see this movie for yourself.  You just might enjoy it.",8,1,2,13 August 1999
