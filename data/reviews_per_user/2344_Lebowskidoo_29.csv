Saturday Night Fever," An Unappreciated Classic
","This movie is not mainly about disco, it's just a setting for the characters.Disco was fun, people were dancing and having fun, the 70's was probably more fun for most people because of it. You didn't have to like disco to go to a disco to be social and interact with people, but disco made that widely popular. Some of you reading this now probably owe your very existence to disco.A lot of hate came from people who preferred rock, they were scared rock would vanish and be replaced by disco. But they didn't realize it would wear itself out on its own, just like rock has today. There are no real rock songs tearing up the charts now.This movie was basically a classic from the moment it opened. The characters, the setting and the dialogue are up there with some of the best 70's movies. You can't fault a great movie for the era it takes place in. If you have never seen it because of some hang up like this, do yourselves a favor and see it. You may change your mind.",10,1,2,9 February 2017
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Definitely Not a Drag
","Hilarious, sweet, raunchy and touching.The actors fill their roles so perfectly. An epic disco soundtrack.That Julie Newmar movie wishes it was half as good as this.",10,1,1,23 June 2019
Alien 3," I Love Alien 3
","David Fincher is ashamed of it, but I've always loved it. It has some epic stuff and some of it has become iconic.Sigourney was told this would be the grand finale of the series, so Ripley dies at the end, sacrificing herself to save humanity. A downbeat ending, but that's what we would expect from such a deadly serious movie series like this. Anyway, in a few years, the whole thing picked back up again, with Sigourney, so it doesn't really matter a whole lot.All the bald heads, especially Sigourney, that's commitment! A prison planet is a cool concept.The alien face to face with Ripley, but leaving her alive because instinct tells it that she is carrying it's spawn. How freaky sci-fi can you get? Since I loved the downbeat atmosphere, I didn't mind that none of the Aliens characters didn't survive. Sure, it was extra cruel, but whatever. Some fanboys cite this as their sole reason for disowning the film.",9,5,9,9 February 2017
Gremlins," A Christmas Classic To Be Enjoyed Anytime
","Gizmo is my spirit animal.Gremlins is truly an epic achievement on all levels. The script, the effects, that score is an ear worm that will never leave your brain, it's just that good!This is one of my most beloved and cherished movies from the 80's. It's both Christmas-y and sentimental, but also dark and twisted.And fun.And funny.Joe Dante, please make more like this!",10,0,1,27 May 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Timeless Movie Magic
","Rewatched Spielberg's classic, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, again, and yes, it still maintains that magic it always had.Having not seen it since the multiple times I watched it as a kid, you now notice all the things you missed originally. Spielberg basically set out to make the entire movie from the viewpoint of Elliott, a kid. Camera angles are from a kid's point of view, adults ignore him, older brothers are annoyed by him, it's all there, I just never noticed the first time because I was exactly Elliott's age then. I mean, we never even see his teacher's face, not once. It's like he's Charlie Brown's teacher too!Another thing I realized watching this as an adult is that the government agents are not as evil as I found them to be the first time. Peter Coyote's character (who is never even given an on screen name) doesn't want to dissect E.T., he's basically Elliott as a grown-up, fascinated and wanting to learn from this alien tourist. He and his team in space suits all seemed so ominous back in the day, but watching it now, you realize they did try to save him and weren't out to chop him up and study him. Well, not until after he was already dead.John Williams' score is almost another character in this movie. So ideal and beautiful, no wonder he's legendary.Dee Wallace kind of breaks your heart a little, as an adult we now know she's heartbroken that her husband has run off to Mexico with some bimbo...and he hates Mexico! My parents were split up when I was Elliott's age, and I was a little isolated and in need of a friend then too. Hmmm, why is it I related so much to this movie?Basically, this movie was an instant classic. All the pieces (not necessarily Reese's!) came together in perfect unison to make this movie. It still creates that sense of wonder and universal sense that although we may be different we can still find ways to love each other. Cornball, I know, but who doesn't love a bit of cornball once in awhile?",10,4,6,4 November 2018
It," Exceptional Adaptation
","I remember it took me the entire summer of '87 to read Stephen King's chunky novel. It seemed equal parts Stand By Me and Dean Koontz's Phantoms to me at the time. The TV mini-series was very well done and seemed to go on to become iconic. So, when a theatrical remake was announced, I was wary. Turns out I had no reason to be.This movie best encapsulates Stephen King's storytelling, childhood and fear itself. It's just beautiful. One of the greatest adaptations of his novels, ever.Pennywise is a truly terrifying cinematic monster for the ages. I've seen way too many horror movies in my lifetime, so a lot of things bounce off me, movie wise. But just as King always intended, Pennywise is horrifying, creeps into your brain and under your skin to show you your worst fears in the most sinister ways. This story has been copied many times in many ways over the years, but here is the unfiltered original. The filmmakers really have done a great job.",10,0,0,4 August 2019
Darkest Hour," Never Surrender
","Gary Oldman is impressive, as per usual, and I love a good historical biopic. A chance to revisit or learn some snippet from the past.That scene on the train, with Churchill and the regular folk, caught me a bit off guard. I found it sweet, inspiring and patriotic (and I'm not even British), and it's what really made the movie for me.And of course, Oldman won the Oscar for this role, he is more than worthy.",10,0,1,23 June 2019
Alien: Resurrection," The Series Gets Fun Again
","I hadn't laid eyeballs on this since that matinee back in 1997, so it seemed fresh and new almost. It's less dreary than the previous episode. It actually is more like Aliens, with it's humor and steady stream of action.Ripley is dead but Sigourney Weaver is back playing a clone instead. It's probably what lured her back a fourth time, playing such a wild variation of the character. That, plus being paid eleven million dollars.Joss Whedon's script is fun and full of many unique choices and homages to this series and other movies. It's pretty obvious that this was the springboard for Whedon's later TV series, Firefly.The newborn baby/alien/hybrid creature had the saddest eyes, you almost feel sorry for it when it gets sucked into space in a most nasty manner.Ron Perlman, classic bad ass, as always!",9,0,0,2 July 2020
Ed Wood," 'This Is the One I'll Be Remembered For!'
","One of my favorite movies of either Burton or Depp, heck, just one of my favorite movies ever. I am so glad I got to see it on the big screen with an appreciative audience when it premiered.I love comedic biopics and this certainly qualifies. It's a loving tribute to all the characters, not just Ed Wood. It makes you bring a new appreciation to rewatches or first time viewings of his work. Martin Landau is perfection here, both heartbreaking and",10,0,1,22 July 2019
L.A. Confidential," 90's Noir Perfection
","I remember going to see this thinking, 'Who the heck are these two no-name actors,' meaning Pearce and Crowe. Well, after seeing them in this, they were both in everything and on the rise and I am now admitting my lame first impressions.This movie has style to spare, and a great noir tale to spin. One of the best movies of 1997, if not the best, it deserved all the Oscars...imagine if the Titanic had never sank!",10,1,1,4 August 2019
Zodiac," Intensity!
","Very few movies have ever made me feel true horror, but this is one of them.Our world is a scary place sometimes, kids. David Fincher knows this and uses it against us in his movies, and we are so lucky that he does.Atmospheric beyond measure, plus the setting and subject matter, all add up to a perfect storm of a movie. Just stupendous moviemaking. Not for the faint of heart.",10,4,5,27 May 2019
Léon: The Professional," Hypnotic and emotional, action packed and brutal, sweet and beautiful.
","This movie caught me way off guard in theaters back in 1994, and it impressed me even more again on a rewatch. Luc Besson's greatest film, and this, from someone who was obsessed with The Big Blue and watched it way too many times.Gary Oldman, in what is probably his most evil and fascinating character, Natalie Portman slaying us all in her film debut and Jean Reno's best role ever. What more could you want?Hypnotic and emotional, action packed and brutal, sweet and beautiful.Éric Serra provides the score, and it reminds me so much of his score for Goldeneye, which I had not yet seen yet back when I first saw The Professional. He even wrote a song for The Professional end credits that got cut in favor of a Sting song, which wound up used in the Goldeneye end credits, 'The Experience of Love.'",10,0,1,13 May 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Killer Queen Movie
","Okay, so I am a massive Queen fan and was ready to nitpick this movie to death...but Rami Malek IS Freddie Mercury, his performance is a result of one of those all time perfect casting choices. He makes you love Freddie even more.The movie is mainly about Freddie and not the other band members, but let's face it, Freddie has the best story to tell.The movie includes Queen doing 'Radio Ga Ga' at Live Aid so I really have nothing negative to say about it.",9,4,5,13 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Lookout! Here Comes the Spider Gang!
","'We're the Spider...uh...Gang!'Here I am, coming very late to the party. When this movie was announced, I was less than enthused, oh yay, a random Spider-Man animated movie. Expectations were not high. Then this thing exploded upon the world to great exclaim. I had to finally see it for myself, and I can gleefully report that it is amazing, spectacular and all the other spider-adjectives combined.Spider-Man was my initial gateway into comics, so I am very pleased the character is given the respect he is worthy of here. This movie has the look and feel of the best Marvel comics. The animation is perfect. The script has all the Spidey-snark we know and love, but also so much heart and joy and wonder and awe. I think the world was pleasantly taken by surprise by this movie.Basically, whoever crafted this work of art should have all the studio bucks thrown at them to produce more like this.One last thing: It fills me with joy to know that Spider-Ham now has an Oscar on his mantel!",10,0,1,22 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Hear Me and Rejoice!
","Hear me and rejoice! Prepare yourselves for a Marvel movie hitherto undreamt of before!This movie has it all! Not only does it deliver on every level you expect it to, it even delivers on levels you weren't expecting. Every character from every Marvel movie is represented and gets their moment. Being the ending of Marvel Studios Phase I, expect some sad goodbyes and a massive battle sequence for the ages.Although a major league sci-fi action superhero spectacular, it has some of the more affecting smaller moments ever seen in a movie of this type. It's a real love letter to the fans, but it makes you wonder if they'll ever be able to top themselves again.I had to wear my 3D glasses out of the theatre because I was too teary eyed.A few questions:Does Pepper Potts in the suit have a superhero name, and is it Iron Lady or Iron Potts?Why didn't Hulk and Gamora get more scenes together? They're both lean, mean green fighting machines!Did Captain Marvel get her hair done in outer space, and if so, where, and by whom?",10,1,6,4 May 2019
The Dirty Dozen," The Dirty Dozen is Basically The Expenables 1967
","Or: The Expendables is basically The Dirty Dozen 2010's, that was my point, it is completely derived from The Dirty Dozen. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's obviously the blueprint for so many action movies that followed. A lot meaner and funnier than I expected going in. Everyone's so young and alive! Charles Bronson had yet to grow his trademark moustache and Donald Sutherland looks like a teenager.I enjoyed this movie and the odd cast mixing together. Telly Savalas as 'Maggot' was one creepy weirdo! Makes you wonder how this sort of movie plays in Germany, if at all?",9,2,5,9 February 2017
Alien vs. Predator," Classic Confrontation
","'The enemy of my enemy...is my friend.'Once again, it has been ages since I saw this, so it seems a little fresh and new. The idea of an alien fighting a predator on the big screen is the stuff geeks live and breathe for, and I am one such geek.It's got a lot of haters, but it's really not so bad. Being a continuation of these two sci-fi classics, it's bound to seem inadequate next to them. My only complaint would be that more alien-on-predator violence would have been nice to see, an R-rated brawl with plenty of acid blood dripping down the screen. It's visually appealing and the action we do get is exciting. The cast is appealing too.",8,0,0,2 July 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," So Good!
","Tarantino delivers again! This movie is full of love for the 60's in Los Angeles, and it has plenty of surprises to keep you interested. Although it's long, you feel like the running time has just whipped by.Pitt and DiCaprio make a great movie team together, and QT has also cast Emile Hirsch in this as well, and we finally get a scene with him and DiCaprio, two people I always thought should play brothers or relatives of some kind. There are so many famous faces in this, some I didn't even realize until it was over, such as Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme!This was a movie not just for film geeks, but everyone can enjoy it. The audience truly appreciated that ending and clapped and screamed and stamped their feet. Or maybe I just had a rowdy crowd, whatever.",10,23,41,13 August 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Summer of Love
","This is really beautiful, falling in love is the same for everyone, but falling in love in Italy during the summer is probably much better.It's the Brokeback Mountain of the millennial generation, and that's not a dig in any way, they deserve a movie as great as that one, and this one nearly is.If you relate at all to that ending scene then you have been lucky enough to know and experience love in your life.",9,2,4,13 August 2019
Groundhog Day," Rodent on Repeat
","A bonafide classic, it does for Groundhog Day what It's a Wonderful Life did for Christmas!It makes you want to run out and really live it up after the movie.Also, my favorite Bill Murray/rodent comedy, the other being Caddyshack.",10,0,0,3 February 2019
The Witch," Wouldst Thou Like To Get Freaked Out?
","I don't think I could ever trust a goat again after this movie.Starts out like some weirder than usual episode of Salem, then grows more and more evil from there on.Freaked me out, and that's always a plus for a horror movie. A great ending!",9,10,20,27 May 2019
30 Days of Night," Fangtastic!
","Still waiting for someone to top this vampire tale, but no one really has, yet.The vampires are legit terrifying, the setting is unique and you get tons of vamp bang for your vamp bucks. Danny Huston creeps me out still, even in other roles.I feel the advancements in vampire cinema made here were derailed by the Twilight craze that followed. This deserved a better sequel than the direct-to-DVD follow-up we got.",10,1,1,27 May 2019
Scream 2," This Is How You Sequel, People
","Someone else is killing Sidney's friends at college. Can't this poor girl catch a break?The stakes were higher, the twists were twistier, the killer(s) were more evil.It's better than the original, yeah, I said it, and I meant it!",10,3,4,13 August 2019
Jaws," This shark, swallow you whole...
","A hungry great white shark decides to camp out near an island beach community and snack repeatedly on the unsuspecting populace. Only the police chief, an oceanographer and an unstable fisherman can stop it together.The most terrifying movie of all time. Growing up in a similar beachside community, I was convinced it was only a matter of time before I was gobbled up by a shark. That primeval fear has never really gone away. Repeated viewings over the years don't really help much. Sure, I still went swimming, but that fear was always swimming in the back of my mind...Contains the single greatest jump scare of all time, you know which one I mean!Perfectly cast, right down to the locals playing the locals. Robert Shaw in particular has created one of cinema's most fascinating characters. His USS Indianapolis speech is so hypnotic, it lures you inside this story to the point that you forget you're watching a movie almost. That's the power of The Spielberg, baby!John Williams' score is otherworldly and so perfect. It's become a part of the fabric of our mutual pop culture. Pure genius.I could rave on and on, but this movie is so huge that the whole world knows it by now and have already written about it in far better ways than I could. My absolute favorite movie of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, stop reading this and see It!",10,4,6,23 June 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Kong is back and better than ever!
","Did they really have Richard Nixon bobbleheads back in the day? Man, I bet those are worth some cash now! This is just great escapist fun, don't see why it would need nitpicking at all, it was created to entertain, and it does. I love the original and the remakes and this maintains and improves on the grandeur of Kong in some ways.Much more action than most Kong movies and the more modern setting is responsible for a few jokes and one heck of a soundtrack. Kong is physically much larger and impressive and there is a sweet story of a missing soldier that runs throughout.Sit back, watch Kong flex his muscles and kick some ass and just have fun!",10,0,3,16 April 2017
Scream," A Classic Thriller That Still Thrills
","That opening sequence with Drew Barrymore reminds me so much of When a Stranger Calls, one of the all-time greatest tension-filled suspense movies ever made. Things proceed accordingly, in this wicked little thriller with some of the most fun dialogue and some real surprises.",10,1,1,13 August 2019
What We Do in the Shadows," It Ain't Easy Bein' Undead
","'Leave me to do my dark bidding on the internet!'The thought of New Zealand riddled with goofy vampires makes me happy. This movie is silly but clever, and that makes me happy too.Be happy.Watch this movie.",10,0,0,27 May 2019
Da 5 Bloods," A Great Joint
","'After you've been in a war, you understand it really never ends.'This Spike Lee joint is such a welcomed surprise in a year where hardly any new movies are being seen. It takes some tonal shifts that I wasn't expecting, that's Spike keeping us on our toes. There's some adventure, a few laughs and some gut-wrenching human drama. It pays respect to the men who served in Vietnam, specifically the unsung black men who served. The more it progressed, the more I loved it. It's eerily timely too.Also, oh my GOD, Delroy Lindo is so HOT right now! He's on fire in this movie! Get outta the way or you might get scorched as he makes his way up there to get his damn Oscar!'Five bloods don't die, we multiply.'",9,2,4,2 July 2020
Alien: Covenant," Backbursting Excellence!
","A little bit Alien, a little bit Prometheus, Ridley Scott tweaks his sequel to appease the Alien fans who didn't love Prometheus. And that's okay, because I'm somewhere in the middle myself. Prometheus tried to be beyond epic and left so much confusion in its wake. The fans wanted a Ridley Scott Alien movie, with the actual xenomorphs, and this one has them.It's still has that grandiose vibe that Ridley Scott brings to the table, but there's intense, brutal attack scenes and lovely gore galore! It has not one, but two Michael Fassbender androids, and they kiss! How's that for freaky? Ridley, trying to give us more of what we want, only different, gives us a backburster and a faceburster! Yes, the chestburster is now so 1979, dontcha know!To all the fans who didn't like this movie, I'm sorry you're disappointed. Nothing is perfect, but it's unlikely we'll receive better than Ridley Scott revisiting his sci-fi masterpiece. I'm having a great time watching all these movies together this week and this one is pretty great. It follows the traditional horror movie pattern a bit more, which Ridley Scott has said he doesn't want to do. I think he compromised with the studio and this is the result. More alien horror, but with still all that titans created humanity mumbo-jumbo etc.Michael Fassbender must have had an acting boner when he learned he was playing opposite himself for most of the movie. He's great as both David and Walter. Jussie Smollett may never get work again, or not, but he's got one heck of a great scene in this. Katherine Waterston as our final girl does a great job, just wish she hadn't had to model a hairdo that made her look like a circumcised knob!",9,0,0,2 July 2020
