Scarface," One of the best all-time movies
","When my wife bought the movie by mistake, it took me by surprise that I did not already own one of the best movies ever made.  Let alone Academy award performances by Al Pacino,  Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfifer, Robert Loggia and most of the other fine cast; this movie is a classic that can not be missed, ever.  The ending portrayed a hard and uncontrolled side of Tony Montana and yet I wish there would be a sequel.  It is sad that all that surveillance equipment was rendered useless by his abuse of drugs.  He probably would have made it out alive, had he not killed Manny.  This movie had me on the edge of the couch, as it did in '83 when I saw it at the movies with my dad. Bravo to DePalma and the people mentioned above.",Null,0,0,21 August 1999
