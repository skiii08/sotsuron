The Incredible Hulk," Boring, worst MCU movie
","The Incredible Hulk was a bad movie which had an ok story with bad dialogue and an ok villain. The beginning was good with the reenactment of when Bruce became the Hulk, but I feel I could've been better and longer, which would've made it a little better. Bruce was a bland character, his love interest was bland, her love interest was bland, Abomination was bland, etc. basically, everybody was pretty bland. You barely even see the hulk until the second half of the movie, and his first and second action scene wasn't very good, but the fight with Abomination was actually good. But really besides that, the movie isn't very good and it feels is if it is very stretched out. Just not a good movie.",3,2,5,10 August 2018
Iron Man 2," Decent Movie
","Iron Man 2 was good. The beginning with Tony at the convention in the suit was a good part and when Whiplash was developing his weapons were both great scenes. When Tony was driving the race car and then had the battle with Whiplash I thought was good, and when Hammer took him in to help take down Tony was also interesting. When Hammer and Whiplash were having the side plot with the bird, though, I thought was stupid and unnessisary. What I did find interesting was when Rhoads took the other Iron Man suit and became War Machine and then fought Iron Man, I genuinely thought that was a great scene. But then the fight when Iron Man and War Machine we're back to back fighting of the bad guys was a good scene, but it seemed to be almost the exact same as Iron Man 1. But the fight with Whiplash was very forgettable. Overall, a decent film.",5,0,0,10 August 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Amazing movie
","Avengers Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie of all time. From beginning to end, I had a grin on my face. The beginning scene with Thor, Loki and Thanos was a great scene with true emotion and feel, but what I didn't like was that Loki has all of these powers that he could've used against Thanos, but he decided to stab him. This just doesn't make sense. I liked the scene with Dr Strange, Tony, Bruce and Wong was very great and their battle was better. Thor with the guardians was a great scene, Spider-Man with Iron Man was great, and all of the other Avengers in Wakanda was all great. When Thanos sacrifices Gamora to get the Soul Stone, you could see that he was genuinely upset and didn't want to, but he had to. And then the battle on Titan didn't have a single thing wrong with it, and you could see the genuine anger in Star Lord when he realizes what happened to Gamora. And then the end scene once Thanos snapped, it had so much emotion and was so unexpected that loud uproar in the theater made it even better. This was a great movie and I cannot wait for Avengers 4",9,2,6,10 August 2018
Iron Man," Very good
","Iron Man was very good. The beginning was great when he was with the army, and when he was working on the first suit while captured. Tony and Pepper has a great connection, and so does everybody else in this movie. I particularly love the scene when he is testing out the suits and the suit parts, which is both visually entertaining and hilarious. Obadious Staine was a great villain, and him as the Iron Mongour was a great sight to see, and you can tell that he wants Tony dead so he can run the company. The final fight is good, but I could have been better, but good enough for me to enjoy it. Overall a great movie.",7,0,0,10 August 2018
