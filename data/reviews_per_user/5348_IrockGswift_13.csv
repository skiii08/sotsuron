Saturday Night Fever," Fun at the club
","This is one of my favorite dance movies of all time. Saturday Night Fever has a very atmospheric and sensual vibe to it. It's definitely a feel good movie and a cult classic. The movie takes place in New York City 1977 where disco was blowing up the airwaves. John Travolta plays a guy name Tony who is a cool Italian blue-collar worker and a nighttime club dancer. This movie besides then hit TV show 'Welcome back Kotter 1975' gave John Travolta a lot of popularity. Saturday Night Fever covers romance,suspense,and drama. As for the movie to take place in New York City,there's always gonna be some type of drama. But besides all that this movie puts the nail in the coffin when disco is at its best. That's why disco will always be remembered as a remarkable dance era. For even today people get on the dance floor and learn to boogie.",Null,0,0,5 January 2005
Rocky V," Rocky's gone back to his roots
","Rocky V is a movie that goes back to Rocky's true essences. After losing everything to a crooked accountant he and his family moved back to his old neighborhood. This is where the Rocky saga got started,but only this time he is older,has a family,and can no longer box in the ring(due to his fight with Ivan Drago in the last film). Many critics may say Rocky V is not Stallone's best Rocky series but it shows a more emotional dark side of Rocky and his family and most of all where his legacy began. In this movie Rocky is welcomed back in his old neighborhood and Rocky,Adrian,and Paulie knows how it is to be broke and hungry. As for Rocky Jr. played by Stallone's son Sage had trouble trying to adapt to the rundown neighborhood and never really being expose to troubled kids and have nots. I can say I have to blame Paulie for negligently allowing the acountant access to Rocky's possessions. But Rocky is such a man with a great heart after losing everything still let Paulie stay with them. This shows that family is always more important then money,fortune,and material possessions,and Rocky always represented strength,courage and determination. Throughout this movie that's what he shows towards an ambitious young fighter (Tommy Gunn played by real-life boxer Tommy Morrison) and later his family. This Rocky film may have a somewhat dark appeal to it but it is just as significant as the previous four movies. Only in this film Rocky is just another man on the block again with some devastating wins in the ring. So Rocky came back to his neighborhood with the respect of his old friends and colleagues. The street fight didn't make sense towards the end but it shows where Rocky came from. Now it's sixteen years later and I hear of a Rocky VI is the making and if Stallone plans to get into the ring,then he will be dead or severely disabled according to the Rocky character.",Null,4,5,9 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," Spidey's greatest challenge
","This movie shows more of an emotional side of Peter Parker. It seems like he was losing everything,his best friend Harry Osborne,the respect from his childhood friend MJ Watson and occassionally losing his spider ability. It started to get more depressing when he told Aunt Ma that he felt responsible for uncle Ben's death. At the party Peter had no luck getting refreshments and Harry was so drunk that he embarassed Peter by telling him that he's not being supportive of his father's death and losing his business. That was enough to make Peter wanting to commit suicide. Dr. Oct was no joke. He had tenticle arms that can rip through steel walls and throw cars around like matchbox toys. This movie had great special effects and some cool fight scenes. But Spider-man knew he couldn't really defeat Dr. Octopus because to me he was much too strong and more of a menace then the Green Goblin. Although Peter Parker was losing everything he got his greatest gift back which was MJ Watson. In this movie Peter Parker had to stop a destructive Dr. Octopus,gain the trust of friend MJ Watson,cheer up a skeptical Harry Osborne and decide that if he wanted to be Spider-man anymore. A lot more in depth than the first movie.",Null,0,1,5 July 2004
Spider-Man 3," Weak and disappointing
","First I would like to say if you expect this film to be a fight to the finish between Spider-man and his arch enemies than your'e badly mistaken. Spider-man 3 was a 2 and a half hour rushed movie. This new villain/rival Eddie Brock came out of nowhere and eagerly wants to step on Peter Parkers toes and become a up coming photographer for the Daily Bugle. Flint Marko A.K.A The Sandman also comes out of the blue as a fugitive on the run and is coinceindentally responsible for Uncle Ben's death. Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that the producers try to add more comedy to this film which the Spider-man element is action,adventure,and some romance. In the past Spider-man is known to make some pretty witty comments. The scene where the black suit takes over Peter Parker personality and he's dancing along the sidewalk could of been left out. That scene in my opinion was so corny and out of place. Mary Jane is confused as ever in this third installment,at first she in love with Peter and when things don't go her way with Peter she look for Harry Osborne for comfort. Didn't they date in the first movie (Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborne) and it didn't work out? But to be honest I like Peter's personality in the black suit he seem no longer to be a patsy. He's more suave and at the same time an asshole,and this time we didn't see him get over-powered by adversities while wearing the black suit. As the movie continued it was becoming more predictable and I began to enjoy it even less. The first two movies were more in depth of character content and this movie fails to do so. Scenes were jumping back and forth till you got dizzy to the point of losing interest in the whole movie. The lab partner(Gwen Stacy) of Peter Parker could of been left out the movie she didn't serve a purpose except wanting to be a Spider-man groupie. My recommendation the movie didn't live up to its hype and if you could wait till it comes on video that's not a bad idea neither.",Null,1,2,10 May 2007
Save the Last Dance," Two different worlds join forces
","A white girl name Sara played by Julia Stiles had to catch on to the fast paced world of hip hop. After moving to the inner city of Chicago with her father (due to her mother dying in a car crash). Derek played by Sean Patrick Thomas attends the same school as Sara and learn they have something in common despite of their race,which is dancing. As their relationship grows their friends began to hate on them. This movie should have been an ABC afterschool special. Now the two have to decide which is more important their relationship or the loyalties to their friends. As for Derek he wants out from his old gang banging days and take his talent to another level. But his boy Malaki(Fredro) is not trying to hear that. A beautiful movie that shows friendship,loyalty,support,and love. An understanding of one's culture.",Null,0,2,19 March 2003
Spider-Man," the coolest superhero alive
","Spidey's the man and Peter Parker became this superhero by chance and not by choice. At first he didn't understand the power he possessed though he learn to control them. The movie follows the similar story as the comic book, but covered most the story it follows. This is what makes Spidey a legend for every generation.",Null,0,0,22 January 2003
The Exorcist," Temporary insanity
","I can't take nothing way from this movie. It is thirty years old and might stir up some fright in people. As for myself I can look at this movie in the dark alone and not be afraid. When I first saw this movie I was a kid and had some sleepness nights,but now that I'm older it has no affect on me. A young girl possessed by the devil and a priest performs an exorcist. Come on! If the devil had that much power why didn't he killed the priest and had many opportunities to. Looking back at this movie it's kinda funny especially when the possessed girl gets freaky with the priest. How sick!",Null,1,1,27 March 2003
The Evil Dead," one of the scariest movies in hollywood history!
","This movie and 'The night of the living dead' has to be the scariest movie in the 20th century. Slasher films have nothing on these zombie films. Slasher films are too predictable and zombie films are suspenseful. Just the fact of not knowing what's going to happen brings more fear to the viewer. When the incident occurs it's more surpising. Overall horror films of the 70s and early 80s are the best because the setting of the movie is dark, the sound effects are eerie, and at the time the movie can give you some restless nights. Nowadays horror movies are high-tech and computerized which takes the horror out of content and becoming more comical. There's nothing like that good low-budget film that gives the movie that gloomy look. This is coming from someone who was brought up watching horror movies in the late 70s and 80s.",Null,0,1,7 February 2003
Drag Me to Hell," A living nightmare
","Sam Raimi knows how to make the main character become a tormented victim in his movies like Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead,Tobey Maguire in Spider-man and Alison Lohman who plays Christine. This movie focus mainly on a woman named (Christine) who is cursed by ill old lady who want an extension on her mortgage. Christine who's only doing her job cannot grant her an extension because the old lady maxed out her extension requirements on her mortgage. I felt sorry for Christine because she felt she had to prove herself to her boss by during what is required to move up a position. Thus living day to day with hellish visions of the old lady and being attack by unseen forces and menacing looking shadows. I think that old lady Ms.Ganish sold her soul to the devil to make a young lady suffer and anticipate a terrible fate. Just like that this old lady come out of the blue and make a innocent young lady's life a living hell is every evil. Ain't like this young lady portrayed to be a spoiled rich heir,she was only trying to make a living and court her boyfriend. This movie wasn't as scary as the previews portrayed it but most of the scenes were hilarious like the old lady biting Christine's face with no teeth in her mouth,and while going to the cemetery and a handkerchief comes to life and attacks Christine. If I was a kid I probably would have been scared. For its terrifying scenes I'm surprise it's only rated PG-13. This movie in my opinion is more of a psychological thriller than a straight horror movie because its suspense and empathy for victim(Christine). I not going to give the movie away but just imagine your life could end a few days later in a horrible way. Drag me to hell makes you wonder,that is why it wasn't a bad movie. This is the type of movie that keeps you thinking wondering what she's going to do next.",Null,0,2,5 June 2009
Rocky," From a nobody to somebody
","There's more to this movie than a man coming up from the streets of Philadelphia. It's about a man who's modest that nobody cares for except maybe his friend Paulie. Until the heavyweight boxing champion of the world Apollo Creed gives an underdog (Rocky) a title shot. Rocky feels he's not in his league and all of a sudden people started treating him better. Even though Rocky had nothing to lose by fighting the champ (Apollo Creed) he had everything to gain like his dignity and self-worth. He found a new lover (Adrian) and the famous town boxing manager wanted to take Rocky under his wing. Things were looking better for Rocky and also his loan-shark boss contribute some ends for Rocky to prepare for the fight. It seems that everybody started to care about Rocky. The most thing I honored about Rocky is that he always had a good heart that's probably why people in his town supported him. Rocky was a man who care about people in his community like taking a ignorant young lady off the street late at night,brought a drunk inside the bar from which he passed out on the sidewalk,and cut a deal with a guy that owed his boss money. A real noble man. The only reason I see people neglecting Rocky because they feel such a good man could do much better for himself. Rocky is a true people's champion. Stallone's best movie of them all. This movie tells us that America is the land of opportunity and the decisions we make could make us or break us. You could be poor today or rich tomorrow.",Null,0,0,17 February 2003
Rocky III," A change of pace
","In this Rocky movie,Rocky is now the Heavyweight boxing champion of the world and is very popular all over the globe. Rocky now appears in commercials,magazines,guest on TV shows and interviews. But Rocky doesn't know a hungry contender is willing to show the world that Rocky's not the best fighter. Mickey (Rocky's manager-trainer-mentor) has watched this rising contender knocked out opponents within a drop of a hat. Mickey sees that this man means business,and at a ceremony he challenged Rocky. Rocky didn't have the hunger he use to have in his earlier days (Rocky 1&2) and did not took his opponent seriously. This is similar to when Apollo was champion and fought Rocky for the first time. In this movie Mickey dies due to heart complications during the mayhem between Rocky and the new challenger Clubber Lang (as known to the world as Mr.T). Clubber was a street-wise brawler from Chicago and pounds on his opponents unmercifully. Now Rocky being unfocused and haven't trained properly eventually lost to Clubber Lang. But Rocky join forces with his old nemesis Apollo Creed to put Clubber away. The training scenes are the most rememberable part of the movie and how they bond so well together. Though I realize in this movie the only reason Apollo wanted to help Rocky was because Clubber disrespected Apollo before Rocky's first fight with Clubber. Being that he saw Rocky wanted to get back at Clubber Apollo wanted to involve himself with Rocky's training. Apollo was a hustler he talk to Rocky about not having the hungry while fighting Clubber Lang that he had when he fought him. He also made Rocky wear his boxing shorts he wore in the first movie,I guess it was to make him feel as if he was in the ring to fight Clubber. In the second round Clubber got the best of Rocky and Apollo yelled at Rocky as if he was losing the fight himself. That why Apollo said to him 'you owe me a big favor',and that favor was to see if he and Rocky still had the 'eye of the tiger'.",Null,0,1,16 June 2003
Halloween," The beginning of the slasher film era.
","A beautifully done horror movie by John Carpenter. When I was six this movie scared me to death and I remember sleeping with my parents for months. Till they bought me a night light. I believe this is the first true horror movie I've seen. A maniac is on the loose and taking out innocent teenagers in the neighborhood. The one thing I notice about this movie was Micheal Myers didn't necessarily go after children but after the adults and teenagers. Then came two years later Friday the 13th (1980) with another maniac killing off another batch of teens. But this time the movie takes place at a camp site. Throughout the 80s Halloween,Friday the 13th,and A nightmare on elm street became popular to movie goers because of its sequels. There were also numerous type of other slasher films like Silent Night Deadly Night (1984),Sleepaway Camp (1983) and  variously other low-budget horror movies that wasn't really a box-office smash. By the early 90s slasher films started to fade away due to it's tiring predictable scenes. Then revived in the mid 90s with 'Scream' and 'I know what you did last summer.' But still these movie couldn't top the earlier classics with that eerie low-budget quality.",Null,1,1,13 April 2003
Carrie," Vengeful student
","After what happen to Carrie I don't blame her what she did to the students and the faculty staff for making her the real butt of a joke. I wouldn't consider this to much of a horror movie because Sissy Spacek just portrayed a teen who was being mistreated by her fellow class mates. Though the woman who portrayed her mother is more wierd then Carrie suppose to be. She locks her in the closet to pray because she went through a woman's dilema,refuse to her interact with other students. That's why she seem wierd to others because her mother didn't allow her to be a teenager. To her (her mother) it's a sin. I think Carrie was cool just misunderstood because of a gift she has by moving objects with her mind. But of course to her mother that's sin and considers her gift the work of the devil. The only reason critics may called this a horror movie because of the dark setting of the movie and it's sound-effects. But I have to say when I was young Sissy Spacey (Carrie) did looked scary walking home and being draped with blood. Still it's more suspenseful than horror.",Null,0,1,7 September 2003
