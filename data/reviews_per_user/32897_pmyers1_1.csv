Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Question about the ending...
","I loved this movie. Yes, it was crude, but it was very funny. I caught myself laughing so loud that I thought I might have hurt my friend's eardrums. My friend did find it a bit disgusting. It didn't bother me at all. You definitely must have an open mind. It was only a movie for God's sake! Yes, it was tasteless, crude and offensive, but I loved it. I do, however, have a question about the very end of the movie. The last scene of the movie everyone is lined up going into Borat's house. Men and women alike. The camera slowly panned through the line and by the time the camera got to the front of the line, the scene was so quick, I couldn't figure out what was going on. Can anyone answer this for me?",10,1,21,9 November 2006
