Frost_Nixon," Intelligent and well-researched
","What starts off as a series of opinions about the terminated presidency of Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) soon turns into a competition of sorts; a mind game between two titans of media and politics, respectively. Third party opinions are spelled out in talking heads, sort of a 'where were you when' as each person recounts the Watergate scandal and the media circus that followed. Meanwhile, British talk show host David Frost (Michael Sheen) becomes engrossed with the idea of extracting an admission of guilt by Nixon, whom he has just seen give his resignation address. The smug demeanor and flagrant disregard for regret is the thing about the televised speech that strikes Frost and several others. Frost, however, finds more meaning in getting high ratings and launching his television career. Through a series of negotiations, Frost hooks the former president for an interview. On each side, both parties believe they have the superior method for coming out on top. Frost and his team at the television studio believe they've found a way to capture the interests of the nation while also taking down a political giant. Nixon, however, is convinced that the interview is going to somehow sooth the public disdain that has been forced on him. An interview with Frost will simply make him appear more presidential, more confident, more qualified as a leader than ever before. After all, he's just a talk show host, right? The real story behind Frost/Nixon is not only the confrontation that eventually comes halfway through the film, but also in the way each opponent underestimates the other and starts to attack the other's vulnerability. Nixon, it appears, has no vulnerability—he's a steel wall, nothing gets past him. It's easier to see Frost as the one who needs to protect himself but that all changes. After a brilliant scene in which a drunken Nixon makes a late night phone call to Frost's hotel room, the susceptibility behind the man is finally exposed. Frost sees an opportunity to flip the interview in his favor. He's now seen that even the most impenetrable men have sensitivity and it can be brought out. Langella's Nixon is perfect. To do what he did, which was to paint Nixon in an almost pitiable light is incredible.The message trying to be conveyed is how on television, it's impossible to see past the camera work and delve deep into the minds of all the people involved. Frost/Nixon is a story within a story—the story of two great minds at battle.My grade: B-",8,1,2,18 April 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Not spectacular but still fun
","First of all, let me start off by saying that I had never sat through an entire movie in 3D before, and it was kind of fun. Of course, I was swatting at things for the first ten minutes, but after I got used to it, it was an enjoyable experience. DreamWorks made a dynamite decision by choosing to release their latest installment in 3D, because although there were some decent laughs, the movie mostly relied on visual effects to keep the viewer interested. Monsters begins with the protagonist, Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), on the day of her wedding to her pompous, weatherman fiancé Derek (Paul Rudd). Right before the ceremony, a freak accident involving a massive falling object (evidently carrying a substance called 'quantonium') pummels Susan into the ground. The quantonium has a bizarre effect on Susan, making her grow 50 feet tall and inexplicably turning her hair white. Understandably frightened to death by the giant woman, the government tranquilizes her and she awakens to find herself in a secure bunker. There, she meets an array of other creatures, appropriately called monsters, and befriends them. First, there's B.O.B, a blue, goop-like substance (Seth Rogen), whose handicap of not having a brain actually makes him more adorable than anything else. Then there's Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a brainy yet mad scientist whose own crazy experiments led to his transformation into bug form. Will Arnett voices a half-fish/half-lizard hybrid named Link that has a curious obsession with weight lifting. Then, topping it all off, there's Insectasaurus, a massive caterpillar-like creature who, sadly, cannot talk. When an alien probe lands on Earth, the President (the incomparable Stephen Colbert) and his advisors decide to release the monsters in order to take on whatever has just invaded American soil. The creature aboard the probe, a slimy, tentacled Martian named Gallaxar (voiced by Rainn Wilson, who's so clearly having a blast), has come to Earth to obtain the quantonium in order to create a clone army of himself to take over the universe. In exchange for defeating the outer-space invader, the monsters will get their freedom. Although it had its fair share of laughs, one of the problems I had with Monsters was that the humor was very topical, but about a year too late. Colbert's President was humorous and well intended, but his general incompetence thwarted him at every turn. Mostly, his advisors just used any opportunity to manipulate him. Does that sound like anyone you know? Maybe a certain president that just left office? What I'm saying is, topical humor is fine, but when it's not relevant anymore, it just becomes stale. Another issue I had was that (and I've noticed this in a couple other DreamWorks movies) the reliance on big name stars to do voice work makes the filmmakers a bit more lax on character development. Admittedly, a primary reason I even wanted to see this movie was that I'm a fan of Seth Rogen and Stephen Colbert, so I wanted to hear them. Most of the voices used in this movie are recognizable because of how popular the actor is, not because there's anything particularly distinctive about them. I remember hearing a joke at the Oscars this year in which Jack Black quipped that he'll do a DreamWorks film (he recently voiced the title character in Kung Fu Panda) only to see the prize go to Pixar come awards season. Well, Mr. Black, DreamWorks movies are usually just as impeccably animated as Pixar but all the big name actors in the world won't captivate audiences if there's no creativity. In the last few years, DreamWorks has come out with, among others, Shrek (1, 2, and 3), Horton Hears a Who!, Bolt, and Kung Fu Panda. The first Shrek is a bad example because that wound up being one of the most original and funny animated movies I've ever seen, but when you compare the latter three with Pixar's most recent installments of Cars, Ratatouille, and WALL-E, there aren't nearly as many big names in the credits, but they also have three things DreamWorks doesn't have—Academy Awards. I think the creative team at DreamWorks needs to kick it up a notch if they're going to have a shot at their first Best Animated Feature Film award since Shrek. That means no more sequels (I'm looking at you Madagascar 2 and Shrek the Third). Also, try and hire some less popular but more talented voice actors. Rogen and Colbert can stay, though, because they make me laugh. To wrap up, Monsters vs. Aliens was captivating in 3D, but lacked finesse in the storytelling. The monsters (Dr. Cockroach, B.O.B, and Link) provided for most of the humor, but it wasn't quite enough to make it stick out in my mind as a truly hilarious movie. As I was leaving the theater with a friend of mine, she pretty much summed it up for me. 'That was cute,' she said. 'I'm glad I saw that.' Need I say more? My grade: B-",7,0,0,18 April 2009
Revolutionary Road," Fabulous acting, heart-wrenching story
","Revolutionary Road is probably most known for its long awaited reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The duo last met in 1997 on a doomed cruise ocean liner in the phenomenally famous blockbuster Titanic. Ironically enough, in 2008, the sinking ship in this situation is their marriage. Through a series of violent arguments and morally questionable behavior, Frank and April Wheeler play the exact opposites of Jack and Rose. Instead of being driven mad with affection for each other, they are stuck in an unhappy relationship being driven mad by all the restrictions that their stagnant lifestyle imposes on them.Trapped in the confines of 1950s suburbia, the Wheelers are living with their children in a quiet little house on a quiet little street. April stays at home and Frank goes to the office. Every day, though, things progress more and more into disillusion as the two start to wonder where their hopes and dreams went. Their lives have been restricted to boundaries of their seemingly picture-perfect life, but on the inside, the strains of commitment and ennui have weakened their relationship significantly. The film is somewhat of a mockery of how we are all forced to hide our problems and put on the old dog-and-pony show to make us look nice on the outside, while behind closed doors there are struggles no one can imagine. Things start looking up for the Wheelers when April suggests that they move to Paris and finally do what they've always wanted to do. An unexpected pregnancy, though, prevents them from going and so begins a slow, downward spiral that's painful but fascinating to watch.The performances of Kate and Leo are arguably the strongest of each of their careers. There's, objectively, nothing to criticize about them. So much pain and emotion flies between them that just watching the Wheelers exchange words is exhausting. Even though their characters are constantly hurling insults at each other, there's still an innate chemistry between them that makes them mesmerizing to watch on screen. DiCaprio's performance all but brought tears to my eyes as the husband who tries his very best to support his family, but is fed up with his mind-numbing job. His tense relationship with his counterpart only makes him all the more stressed and genuinely confused about how to fix the situation. April seems like more of the free spirit and although Frank cares for her, their values are starkly different. One particular scene that especially moved me was after a particularly bad episode with April, he comes downstairs to find her calmly cooking breakfast as though nothing even happened the night before. In response to April slinging an 'I hate you' at him the previous night, he just looks at her and asks—something to the effect of—'you don't hate me, right?' It's just a few, simple words, but they succeed in being the most poignant words spoken throughout the whole movie. It's great acting, and DiCaprio does not disappoint.Kate Winslet has never been under appreciated as an actor, and rightfully so. Every movie she's in, romantic, dramatic, funny, what have you, she always plays the part. She has mind-blowing versatility, and Revolutionary Road is no exception. April would be easy to make into the villain. After all, she's upstaging her family in pursuit of a pipe dream, she has unrealistic expectations of her husband, and she's overzealous (arguably, to a fault) when it comes to the chase of said dreams. Winslet, though, is able to make a sympathetic plight for April. Although a severely flawed character, she's still humanized and relatable. Not to mention, she's a powerhouse screen presence and she's so tapped in emotionally to her part that it's riveting.The general consensus among critics and audiences is the not-so-cheery ending. One can't help knowing that something bad is coming considering the gloomy tone of the whole storyline, but thanks to DiCaprio and Winslet, the depressing plot is still watchable. Mostly due to the actors, Revolutionary Road may not have been a hit during awards season (whoever is responsible for DiCaprio not earning an Oscar nomination should be locked up), but I was glad I saw it. The directing (by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes) is precise enough to allow the actors to do what they do best and the source material (the novel by Richard Yates) is nothing to sneeze at. Hopefully, Kate and Leo will reunite in the near future to deliver the same gripping performances as this one.My grade: B+",8,0,1,18 April 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Beautiful inside and out
","Any movie that's over two and a half hours long is going to be difficult to form an opinion on because there's so much material to consider. In other movies where characters might undergo changes in the course of two weeks or even just an evening, the characters in this movie go through an entire lifetime of trials and tribulations and it has to be compressed into less than three hours. Naturally, this was a complicated film to tackle, and I have to say, director David Fincher managed to pull so much complex material together into a tidy fantasy. Benjamin Button is the story of the title character, Benjamin, who is born under 'unusual circumstances.' Born as a sickly, old man, Ben ages backwards and gets younger on the outside as he advances in years. His 'childhood' is his old age and his brittle bones and frail external appearances isolate him from the rest of the world. Right from the beginning, it seems the wisdom of adulthood and eventual mental depletion will come hand in hand with the outward appearance of a child. It's something never before seen on film, and it's fascinating to watch Benjamin's life progress, ultimately, backwards. The cinematography itself is gorgeous. The different time periods are presented in such a squeaky-clean manner that the worst actors in the world could be put in front of the camera and the movie would still be beautiful. The thing that makes this story so special is its message and its honest, sincere performances. The acting, which is humble yet moving, makes the movie not only superficially attractive, but also emotionally deep. The recognizable Brad Pitt everyone knows doesn't appear until over halfway through the film, but his acting has matured so much since his early cinematic adventures that it's hard to believe it's him hobbling around in the beginning. The reason Pitt probably wasn't acknowledged so much for his excellent portrayal is that the character of Benjamin isn't so much a scenery chewer as he is a mild-mannered, regular guy who's trying to make his way in the world. Benjamin is relatively soft-spoken, but Pitt's performance manages to command attention. Cate Blanchett, in my opinion, was criminally ignored this past award season. Blanchett has proved herself an actor with incredible versatility having played such historical characters as Queen Elizabeth I (Elizabeth) and even Bob Dylan (I'm Not There). As Benjamin's love interest, Daisy, she dances her way through the film with grace and poise. I'd go so far as to call her performance perfect. The character of Daisy is written as someone who's so remarkably beautiful and sweet that it's hard to believe she's real. I can't imagine anyone playing that part as well as Blanchett did. She's unreal in her surface qualities, but she still makes it possible for the audience to grow attached to Daisy.The message of Benjamin Button is clear: a lifetime of struggle is worth it if one can obtain true love and just a few moments of bliss. Although Benjamin's life is extraordinary and beyond any of most of our reach, the underlying theme of appreciating life (no matter what the circumstances) is something that audiences will be able to grasp. The movie may leave some a bit depressed and forlorn about the inevitable demise of its two main characters (the final act is not without its heart-wrenching moments) but the purpose of the film is more than just its characters, it's the message that each person should take away from it. Fincher takes on a heavy subject matter and makes it accessible to the average person while simultaneously raising the bar in epic storytelling. My grade: A-",10,1,4,18 April 2009
