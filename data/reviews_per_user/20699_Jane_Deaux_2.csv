Deja Vu," I recommend it!
","I saw this movie tonight and I thought it was pretty good. Usually I try to steer clear of time-travel movies because they seem too stupid to bother with. Time-travel is not possible and to try to make a movie where everyone is skipping around in time is just irritating.It's because they try to explain too much. I'm fine with wormholes and 'bending space' but when they go into to all the scientific explanations, my suspension of disbelief starts to falter. I want to understand but never will because time-travel (TT) is just not possible.They did a good job working with TT in Deja Vu. It wasn't the movie revolving around this phenomenon, it was a good plot, some exciting action, and interesting dialog and situations... and some TT.Aside from time, I liked the way the movie looked. Like all the Tony Scott films, it has a gritty feel and there was a lot of motion--whether it was people running around or just the camera moving around still objects or people, I felt like I was in a hurry. Very edge-of-your-seaty.The only thing I didn't really like was TT-related. I won't give it away, but when it happened I immediately thought 'This is why they shouldn't make movies about time-travel.' Of course, I only thought that after I said out loud 'DUH! Why can't you see that?!' But it was only a little thing and the forehead-slapping moment went away.",8,7,15,22 November 2006
We Are Marshall," Parents: Beware of Language
","I saw this movie and, like a lot of people already, I really liked it. It's a good sports-movie but it's a great people-movie. The movie is apparently true to actual events and I think that is really what made the movie so good--it wasn't glamorized by Hollywood.Matthew M. did an excellent job. I think this is his best movie to date. His character was in a challenging position and MM played the part perfectly, balancing enthusiasm for the team, sympathy for the town, and really capturing the helplessness that Jack Lengyell experienced when faced with the mourning and confusion or anger of the people who didn't agree with the rebuilding of the football team.The whole cast did well with the grieving process, wonderfully portraying the desire to move on while still feeling the hurt of the accident. There was a scene from the movie shown in the trailer, when they look out a window and the town is there shouting 'We are... Marshall!' For me, this was a very moving scene and I got a little teary!One thing for the parents who were thinking of bringing their families: I wouldn't say that there is 'quite a bit' of language, but MM says the S-word several times. There is other, mild language, but this stood out to me and I was surprised to find that it was only rated PG. It's definitely not enough to ruin the movie and is still good for the family with it's uplifting message about over-coming tragedy and hardship, but just be aware that some parents might not want their kids to hear some of it. I don't recall anything worse than the S-word... but there was some drinking.",8,7,18,13 December 2006
