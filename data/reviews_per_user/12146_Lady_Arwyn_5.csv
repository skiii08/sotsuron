The Finest Hours," Slow to start, but grows into a great action-disaster flick
","This movie approaches perfection in disaster films. The acting was superb, the special effects amazing and the story unbelievable - but true. My heart was in my throat - and I already knew the whole story from earlier research of the true-life incident - who lives and who dies. They actually skipped some elements of the day's work for the Coast Guard, probably because no one would believe it.The only weakness I saw with the movie was that it was a bit slow in the start, too much romance in the beginning and not enough exploration of our four Coast Guard heroes. We only really meet and get to know Webber (Chris Pine), and it spends too much time exploring his romance. The movie makers attempted to shove some strong female characters into the story - beyond a brief introduction to establish Webber's motivations and history, they really didn't belong in the story.But in the end it was worth it because the scenes of the crippled, broken SS Pendleton are edge-of-your seat stuff, and once Webber and his crew get in their little 36-foot motor lifeboat and head out into 60-foot seas, you're in for the ride of your life.",9,3,13,29 January 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," Sticking to science slows the movie down, but...
","Yesterday NPR (National Public Radio) interviewed two climatologists from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) regarding the science in The Day After Tomorrow. The main question was 'Is the science in the movie at all realistic?'.The short answer was yes, but sped up. The movie takes place over a few months. The NOAA scientists took the long route to state that while everything in the movie was basically correct, it would take months, not weeks, for things to develop. They said that, unlike 'Armageddon' and the recent TV movie '10.5', this movie was Science Fiction, with the emphasis on science more than fiction. They were actually quite impressed with the scientific accuracy the movie makers presented. It will never be used to teach climatology, but the science wasn't rendered unrecognizable by the moviemakers.So I looked in the paper for reviews, the movie received three of four stars. Usually blockbusters like this only get two stars. So last night I grabbed the boys and my hubby and we went out to see the movie.Well, the theater was packed for the 7pm showing, people were laughing and talking about suspending their disbelief for an evening. They were clearly expecting something along the lines of Armageddon and the recent 'Core', a fun adventure with laughable science.By the end of the movie I was a little disgusted by the overt political/environmental message, they could have gotten the point across without the heavy handed preaching at the end. I was unimpressed with the CG (a pack of wolves is done very badly, the tornado's in LA overdone, the rest is standard for modern special effects but nothing special), with occasional editing problems. There were clearly several scenes cut, probably at the last minute because you could tell that something was missing.The acting was so-so. I wish they hadn't used Dennis Quaid, he was OK, but I got the feeling that this movie would have been better with all unknowns. Quaid was only one of two actors I recognized, but I bet some of the teenage leads were probably known to some folks. I didn't much appreciate the lead teen male, but probably because I simply thought he was ugly.The time-line of the movie is a little confused. It feels like only a few days from start to end, the whole thing feels like it happens in less than a week. But if you pay attention to clues, it actually takes place over a few months. Dennis Quaid doesn't walk 40 miles in snowshoes in a day or two, as it appears, it's closer to a week. I was satisfied with the basic science of the movie, and impressed with the storytelling. They didn't make the teenagers 'scream machines', only there to be rescued, for once, the lead teen was actually very level headed and simply did what needed to be done. And rather realistically, he was motivated by hormones. There were only two scenes that I felt were unnecessary, both were in the previews, the scene where the climatologists' camp was right on top of the crack when the ice shelf breaks off (I felt it would have worked just as well if they had been back further and just felt the rumbles and cracking and watched the ice shelf break off from a distance, and the wolf chase scene. They didn't really need the wolves, the scene could have been played a little more realistically, but at lest the people were smart and used their brains to solve the wolf problem,not relying on someone's last second heroics. The bad wolf CG really didn't help the scene along.I was rather impressed that they didn't feel the need to turn it into a 'violent orgy of death and destruction' every minute of the movie. They actually spend some 'quality time', which less mature viewers would view as boring parts, dealing with the science of the disaster, people and something resembling reality. They actually acknowledged that if you drop an unconscious person off a roof, he's going to get injured.There were a few good digs on President Bush and Vice President Cheney in the characterizations of them (they weren't specifically Bush and Cheney but it was clear they were meant to be) , and there were some really ironic-funny scenes of the US/Mexico border being closed, by the Mexicans, and illegal crossing of the border... of Americans headed south! On a scale of 10, I would give this movie a 7.5, and I do recommend it.",8,0,0,29 May 2004
Transformers," An excellent homage to an 80s classic
","As a young teen in 1984 I was a major fan of Transformers. So, when I learned it was coming out as a movie I was psyched, but worried that movie makers would screw it up and leave it unrecognizable.I was there opening night, with my kids, ready for anything. What I saw on the screen was quintessential Transformers and I was Pleased. Even though it was updated to reflect the 12st Century, this was the Transformers I knew.I would have liked to see more character development for the Transformers, and less for the humans. Much of the Transformers characterizations relied on knowledge of and referred to the original cartoon, such as Megatron's seemingly non-sequitor comment to Starscream regarding Starscream's repeated failures.The good side to this is that for fans of the original Transformers, there were many references to the cartoon. The nature of the Transformers arrival was changed, as was their reason for being on Earth.Transformers is NOT a movie for kids. I saw at least one mom taking her child (age 5?) out of the theater after repeated 'colorful' language and violence, including many graphic scenes of human death, and overt sexual innuendo. Even the cartoon of the 80s was rather dark, one of the few cartoons where characters, human and Transformer, actually died in battle.",9,1,4,5 July 2007
300," Epic fantasy history, a new classic
","I just got back from seeing 300 in a sold-out theater.They got the culture of the Spartans right: Boys are taken from their families and serve in the military with only minor contact with their families until they are 30. They are often married in absentia, visit their wives for short overnight visits. They sometimes didn't know their sons, as sometimes the sons turn 7 before the fathers reach 30 - the lives of young trainees and soldiers didn't cross. The great leaders stay on in the military as generals.The rights granted to Spartan women were a source of friction between Sparta and Athens, Spartan women could inherit land and speak in the Assembly, mostly because the men were so busy being soldiers there was little other choice. They even had a 'Women's Olympics' and trained the women in defensive fighting - a rather realistic people they were, the women could defend themselves if they have to. Sparta's treatment of women was highly uncharacteristic of the time or region.I thought the film was a great comic-book re-telling of a historic battle. They went a little overboard with the 'make the enemy into monsters' thing, rather literally. It was more LotR Orc-type fantasy than history, but it worked for the story.Gory. Way, way gory. But somehow all those half-naked Spartan soldiers with the incredible pecs and six-pack abs never got any blood on them. Unless of course the storyline calls for it.300 has an epic fantasy feel to it, the filmmakers never bothered to try to make it look real, it is a comic-book come to life. It is not a film that cares about details, the Persian Army is a mass of distant figures and lights and tents. It is bigger than life, and grittier than dirt. 300 is a film that is about the big picture. The distant Persian Army is massive, so massive it's numbers and individuals don't matter. All that matters is these few Spartan soldiers who stand between the Persians and their home.",10,0,6,10 March 2007
Happy Feet," A Freethought film for kids, and 'An Inconvienent Truth, Junior Edition' SPOILERS
","SPOILERS warning. DO not read any more if you don't want to know!A young penguin, Mumble, is born 'different' from the others. The visible issue to the kids is that he dances, while all other Emperor Penguins sing. The less visible issue is that this is a little freethinker. He hates being different, but is not willing to deny himself just to fit in.There is a penguin religion, the great penguin in the sky controls everything from weather to the food (fish) supply. And the fish are not around anymore. The Great Penguin must be angry at them. The old penguins (who act like a cross between an old priest and the annoying old man who lives in the apartment upstairs) are concerned about this child who is 'different' and predict that he will be the downfall of the entire colony.Mumble can't sing, so he can't take part in Penguin School, and feels very left out. He was also hatched late and is late maturing. When all of the other young penguins are ready to graduate and go off to the feeding grounds by themselves, he is denied the ceremony. He follows them anyway and ends up separated from the group.Somewhere in here (I forget when) Mumble gets a clue that there is a real-world source for the fish shortage. Something is happening to them, but what, he has no clue.Then he meets a group of smaller penguins. They lead him to their colony and he discovers *gasp* that not all penguins do as his colony does! They actually collect rocks instead of sing! This confuses the poor young penguin.This new penguin colony has a religious leader who can answer any question. Think Holy Roller (a strong physical resemblance to Rev. Al Sharpton) with six pack rings stuck around his neck (a gift from the gods, he says, and the source of his powers). He answers everyone's questions (basic stuff) until he gets to our young freethinker, who quickly figures out that the nonsense that this penguin is spouting is not an answer and calls him on it. Which gets Mumble kicked out.So, Mumble returns to his colony with a plan. His initial plan fails, but he manages to get all of the penguins dancing and wins the heart of his girl. However, the priestly penguins are horrified, certain that this upstart will bring the wrath of the Great Penguin down on their heads. It doesn't help when Mumble starts trying to use reason to explain that the fish are disappearing due to an earthly problem, not a godly one.So, Mumble is exiled from his colony and the real adventure (and environmental message) begins.I won't tell you any more, the story is pretty decent. The kids might or might not see the whole freethinker v religion theme, but it's worth it to have a movie that has a theme where reason and investigation (science) triumph over superstitious beliefs.There are also strong environmental themes in Happy Feet, mostly int he second half of the film. Occasionally we're hit over the head with it, but it doesn't detract much from the storyline.Some scenes it's hard to believe it's animation, it looks real. The Orcas are especially convincing. Some scenes are very intense, possibly too scary for a young child. I would recommend that children younger than 6, or sensitive 8 year olds, might not handle parts of this film well. It is rated PG, not G, for a reason. There is also a distubing section of the film where a penguin is visibly and graphically slowly choking to death. If you are a freethinking person/parent who accepts responsibility for the damage humans do to the Earth, this is a great film for you and your kids. YOU will love the music, the kids will enjoy the movie. If you're religious or aren't convinced that the world has massive human induced problems, you might want to skip this one.",10,6,9,4 December 2006
