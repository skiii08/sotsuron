10 Cloverfield Lane," The Right Postcode!
","I'm probably in the minority, but I disliked Cloverfield ... intensely! So many of these found footage films as far as I'm concerned, are just an invitation to watch someone's tarted-up home movie. Their producers/directors should be commended for being excellent marketing strategists in being able to convince punters to part with their hard-earned, to watch some (generally) cheap, tacky B feature. Cloverfield was no exception.However in a significant turnaround, I'm happy to report that the Cloverfield's 'blood relative' (according to JJ Abrams) is a much better production and a far more interesting story, than its predecessor. Technically speaking 10 CL is streets ahead, with the found footage format dispensed with and a small, but very professional cast employed in telling the story of 3 people dealing (not always on a voluntary basis) with life adjustments in a world affected by the events at the end of Cloverfield.The cast were uniformly good with Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle and John Goodman as Howard being the obvious lynchpins. Knowing virtually nothing about the storyline going into the film (apart from it having some vague relationship with Cloverfield), I have to admit I was pretty much hooked by the unfolding series of events affecting Michelle pretty early on. And as both her seemingly sometime antagonist and ally, Goodman's Howard is the perfect physical contrast. But very pleasing to see another independently resiliant and strong female lead character being featured in such a surprisingly entertaining and thrilling sequel as 10 CL turns out to be.Much has been commented about the film's climax. I have to admit to some ambivalence. This is where the relationship to the earlier film is given some clarification, whilst overtly setting up the stage for a later episode. Still rejoicing over the absence of found footage, I guess I could just about accept anything thrown up by the producers. I will admit to some disappointment in that the events are clearly played out in real time, with Michelle emerging from the shelter at what is clearly the beginnings of dusk. For some reason an unlikely darkness then overwhelms the setting within about a minute of screen time and with the subsequent taking up of hand-held cameras, the action suddenly becomes more difficult to discern. Though I was still somewhat relieved, I can understand how others may have experienced some disappointment.I'll admit to looking forward to the next instalment and even perhaps girding my loins and giving the original another watch, just to see again how well (if at all) it sets up this story.",8,2,2,20 February 2019
The Finest Hours," Didn't Deserve to Tank at the Box Office!
","Have to admit I hadn't heard of this film till recently, probably because it was apparently such a commercial flop. More's the pity, as it tells a wonderfully engrossing and thrilling true life marine rescue on two levels; as seen from the rescued on the stricken SS Pendleton and their Coast Guard would - be rescuers.Touted as being the story of the Coast Guard's greatest small boat rescue, it just seems a shame that such a fine film wasn't seen by a larger audience. Movies set on water seem to frequently have as high a disaster rate, as do the subjects with which they frequently deal (Water World, In the Heart of the Sea, Cutthroat Island etc.) and this seems to have suffered much the same fate.The Finest Hours features a great cast with Chris Pine and Casey Affleck both outstanding, playing similarly shy, somewhat introverted leadership roles; the former as a junior Coast Guard officer asked to mount a small-scale rescue attempt and the latter as the doomed ship's chief engineer, improvising desperately to keep the mortally damaged tanker afloat as long as possible to afford a chance of rescue for the surviving crew members.I really liked the highlighting of Holliday Grainger's Miriam. Though she was arguably perhaps fictionalised more than some of the other characters, in creating this strong onshore female, a powerful emotional core of the film was established. On the flip side of this, Eric Bana did his best in a fairly thankless role as the Coast Guard commander Daniel Cluff. Even just a brief perusal of his Wikipedia entry, indicates that he wasn't the self-doubting, inexperienced head of operations, we see in the film, created no doubt to provide an idealistic counterpoint to Chris Pine's almost laconically casual, Bernie Webber. In addition to this, Ben Foster stands out in a supporting role, where though having few lines of dialogue to speak, he imposes himself indelibly through a terrific range of facial expressions, glances and general body language.Unlike a vehicle such as The Perfect Storm where one felt at times the special effects weighed down the (somewhat, slight) story being told, no such claim should be made about this movie. It achieves a very comfortable balance of CGI enhanced action, which never threatens to comparatively diminish the true elements of a remarkable story some 66 years old, that this film succeeds in recognising.",8,2,3,26 November 2018
3:10 to Yuma," Don't Miss This Train!
","3:10 to Yuma is an example of a good film (the 1957 version) being remade into an even more memorable one. Directed by the ever consistent James Mangold, it is a suspenseful, beautifully paced western, with a great cast creating many memorable characters. The changes made to the original film, based on an Elmore Leonard short story, only enhance the storyline and give it greater relevance in the 21st century.Russell Crowe is outstanding as the highly intelligent, but deadly, outlaw gang leader Ben Wade imbuing him with a degree of sympathy viewers can't ignore. Christian Bale never overplays his up against it, Civil War veteran Dan Evans and he especially shines in his third act interplaying with Crowe, where his character's courage and quiet dignity are fully revealed. But it's not just the leads that stand out. Ben Foster's creates an arresting psychopathic, but loyal, Charlie Prince, who's Wade's second in command. And it's a pleasure to see Peter Fonda filling a significant supporting role, as Byron McElroy, an elderly Pinkerton agent hired by the Railroad company to hunt Wade and Alan Tudyk turning up, as a dubiously qualified medico, with an adventurous streak.In a storyline that doesn't feature a huge number of female characters, Gretchen Mol's scenes as Dan's wife, Alice, are both realistic and affecting and I loved her dinner interlude with Ben Wade, as he attempts to both charm her, whilst hopefully making preparations, for a possible future escape. Logan Lerman does just about the impossible, in what is a far more beefed up role from the original film. He turns Dan's (at first) brattish, impressionable, teenage son William, into a young man who we see has come of age by the film's exciting climax, which again has been very smartly tweaked, from the earlier version.The action scenes are really well choreographed and the cinematography from Greek professional, Phedon Papamichael, is never less than impressive. By story's end, it's abundantly clear that James Mangold's exceedingly well-made remake isn't as simply expressed as its predecessor, but more layered with elements of morality to consider for our modern sensibilities.Catch the 3:10 before it leaves the station.",9,0,1,1 March 2020
Train to Busan," First Class Ride on the Zombie Express!
","Not since George A Romero's ground-breaking Night of the Living Dead have I been quite so excited by a zombie film, as I have by Korean director Yeon Sang-ho's outstanding Train to Busan written by Park Joo-suk. Just as Romero's iconic black and white feature almost single-handedly dragged horror stories away from the antiquated gothic conventions of yesteryear, Train to Busan is most definitely a zombie film for a 21st century global world, familiar with the challenges associated with all manner of international travails.The film mostly takes place on a bullet train travelling from Seoul to Busan as a zombie apocalypse suddenly breaks out in the country and threatens the safety of all the confined passengers. These include Seok-woo a cynical workaholic fund manager and divorced father of his daughter Su-an, who wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Other passengers include Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, Yon-suk a calculating, manipulative chief executive, a high school baseball team including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a traumatized homeless stowaway hiding in the bathroom. As the train departs, an ill young woman runs onto the train unnoticed. She turns into a zombie and attacks a train attendant, who also turns. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the confined spaces of the train.The beauty of this film is that it doesn't just concentrate on the provision of standard visceral generic thrills. It serves as a vehicle to highlight civil unrest resulting in mass hysteria and general panic and indecisiveness; the root of confusing mixed messaging and communications from governing authorities. It can also be seen as a scrutinising microscope, forensically examining the breakdown of nuclear families, socio-economic class distinctions and seeking answers to ethical and moral questions such as which is of greater importance, survival of the individual or the collective?Fine performances abound from the large cast with particular attention being directed towards Ma Dong-seok as Sang-hwa, a tough, working-class man, who is first to demonstrate to other passengers that it is possible to fight back against insurmountable odds, whilst showing care towards other individuals. Ostensible lead actor Gong Yoo is also very convincing as a self-centred work obsessive, who slowly realises his personal responsibilities to others, as well as his own latent skills and talents that may help him and others survive the onslaughts they must face.The film created on a budget of just US$8.5 million is a technical marvel, filled with a number of amazing shots, which I for one couldn't help wondering how they had actually been staged and to what extent, if any, was CGI involved. The suspense and thrill factor is only enhanced by a number of twists and turns and breath-taking set pieces which never appear contrived or staged, rather logical outcomes from previous actions.I can only encourage you to grab a ticket and climb aboard the Train to Busan; not just a clever, fresh take on the zombie genre, but also an extremely well-made film with fully realised characters and plenty of social commentary to underscore the bursts of skilfully staged action.",9,0,0,1 April 2020
Captain Marvel," Reserving My Judgement!
","As an origin story, Captain Marvel is pretty long and convoluted in the telling, with no great surprises in the pay-off. To me, it just seemed early on, way too dependent on special effects to maintain the pace in space and on Hala, rather than being story driven. Things pick up appreciably when Vers arrives on Earth hooking up with Nick Fury, reacquainting herself with Maria and Monica Rambeau and just generally interrelating amusingly with Terrans, such as we see during the train sequence.For all its twists and turns, the story is pretty slight. I mean really how could the homeless Skrulls as we end up seeing them in the film, really pose such a threat to the advanced world of Kree? And why does Captain Marvel end up disappearing from Earth again, for some 25 years (off screen), when she'd just arrived back from a 6 year absence. Surely it didn't take 25 years to help the Skrulls find another home world? In terms of entertainment value (and its hard not to compare them), I think Wonder Woman is a more polished, complete product and one which doesn't give rise to so many questions after viewing it.However I thought Brie Larson was an excellent choice for Captain Marvel, displaying just the right balance of plucky feminism, empathy, humour and heroism. The supporting cast were very good too, particularly the 'de-aged' Samuel L Jackson. And I love the 'Goose' character, but shouldn't he/she also get some sort of back story? The puss just seems to step out of nowhere and later of course we find that he/she is not your typical run-of -the-mill cat.In terms of production standards Captain Marvel looks like just about any other $150+ million movie. No better, no worse.It's going to be interesting to see how the Captain Marvel character is used in the upcoming Avengers sequel. She seems powerful enough to take down Thanos, by herself. I guess it's a case of may be watching this space.",7,3,9,4 April 2019
Green Room," White Knuckle, Green Room!
","In the tradition of unexpectedly good siege/survival films such as Assault on Precinct 13 and Straw Dogs comes Green Room from writer/director Jeremy Saulnier. It takes the typical victims being terrorized in a 'cabin in the woods' and then cleverly keeps pulling the carpet out from under the expected generic tropes set-ups.Instead of demons/serial killers doing the dirty work, we have a band of skinhead neo-nazis, led by of all people, Patrick Stewart, generally underplaying his role neatly and only occasionally displaying his full evil intent. And instead of your usual mixed bunch of unlikeable teenagers being set upon, Saulnier gives us the four members of a punk band, the Ain't Rights, travelling through the Pacific Northwest. Desperate for money, they take a gig, they would have preferred not to have done, at the neo-nazi bar, situated in a lonely forest venue. Before they can leave after their gig, they find themselves attacked by the skinheads after witnessing a murder in the club's green room. Pretty much totally out of their depth and completely unsure about what to do next, they barricade themselves in the room, whilst desperately hoping to come up with a solution to their predicament.The major selling point of Green Room is that it definitely has an air of realism about the general scenario. None of the twists and turns that occur appear contrived. It's not spoiling to say that during the hours that follow the discovery of the murder, the band are joined by some resourceful allies, again occuring after a chain of logical happenings. The action and violence that we see occur isn't stylishly choreographed, but rather the sort of stuff we might imagine happening from opponents on both sides, unused to dealing out the rough stuff and then seeing the up-close results.Green Room serves as a reminder of how much of a loss, we suffered due to the way too premature death of Anton Yelchin. As the quietly spoken sort of leader of the Ain't Rights, he gives us a completely different character from that of his best known and much loved Pavel Chekov in three Star Trek films of the latest franchise and in the process demonstrates he knows his way around a bass guitar.Stewart and Yelchin get great backing from a veritable ensemble of a support cast with standouts for me being Imogen Poots as Amber, who proves to be extremely resourceful after throwing off her initial shell shock and Saulnier regular Macon Blair as Gabe, a club employee and Stewart's right hand man, who may not be quite so wedded to the cause as his boss.Both a critical and commercial success, Green Room is a dynamic, occasionally darkly comic, unusual take on a popular film genre and thanks to a gritty no holds barred authenticity, proves to be thoroughly entertaining. Make sure you don't miss the Ain't Rights, if they happen to be performing around your neck of the woods.",7,1,2,8 April 2020
The Babadook," Midnight Rambling!
","The Babadook is a terrific debut feature for writer/director Jennifer Kent. On a limited budget, she has produced a work of genuine originality, whilst operating ostensibly in the horror genre. Crucial to the success of the film is lead actress Essie Davis, who gives a fantastic performance as, lonely, grieving widow Amelia, whose own depressed state, is only exacerbated by the obnoxious and anti-social behaviour of her extremely needy 6 year - old son, Samuel.Much of the film is shot in Amelia's and Samuel's house, but the movie never feels in the least bit stagey. It was interesting reading Kent's comments that she originally envisaged deliberately fostering a 1950's set look, even considering filming in black and white to highlight the anachronistic feel. I'm personally glad she changed her mind over that concept and I think the skilful work of Polish cinematographer Radek Ladczuk, put the final seal on adopting any retro-look. The camera swings, tracks and zooms in and out of the Babadook's adopted residence, snake-like in it's character-revealing intent. The sound editing too is first-class. It always enhances the bleak, moody atmosphere and suspense quota, without inserting overpowering effects aiming for cheap jump shocks.The Babadook is not flawless by any means. For whatever reason, Samuel is just established from the outset, as a complete brat. Thereafter, it becomes rather difficult for even the most compassionate of viewers to feel much sympathy for him. There's very much a repetition factor happening as well. We already are witness to the fact that he drives his mother towards exhaustion and exasperation by getting her up every night and eventually climbing into her bed. So there's not much happens that's different after the supposedly terror - inducing Mister Babadook book is discovered and read.On a less significant level, Australian homes virtually never have the North American - like basement that is seen in the movie, crucial though it is to the plot. And I tend to agree with quite a few other reviewers that the conclusion appears to have escaped Kent somewhat. In the context of the rest of the film, there just seemed to be a sudden injection of unneeded special effects and Samuel's role in the way things panned out, seemed to me, to be rather ludicrous, considering his age and earlier behaviour.But too reiterate, The Babadook is a very good initial outing for Jennifer Kent and I look forward to seeing her second production The Nightingale, about which, I've also heard really good things. Meanwhile appreciate The Babadook for what it really is. A clever, multi-layered story about how incredibly difficult being a parent to a troubled child can be. And it's all dressed up as a 'horror movie'. Who would have thought?",7,0,0,9 May 2020
The Mummy," Change of Setting!
","There's no doubt the movie business can be an unpredictable affair at times. In 1998 Stephen Sommers wrote and directed a disaster/monster feature with fairly rich comic undertones to it. It was called Deep Rising and it tanked (despite this writer liking it) fairly spectacularly, though it has gone on over the years to achieve a degree of cult status.Now for some writer.directors that commercial failure may have represented the kiss of death. But in this case, not for Stephen Sommers. A year later Universal Pictures almost doubled his budget from Deep Rising and let him go and make what was almost the same sort of film again. Go figure. At any rate their intuition proved to be correct. Sommers remake of The Mummy, turning it from a horror film into a tongue-in-cheek action adventure proved this time to be a commercial master stroke and franchise starter. Sommers and Universal had an international hit on their hands.What changed? Superficially heaps, but intrinsically, not a great deal. Both films deal with monsters, The Mummy less mysteriously. The obvious differences are the settings. Deep Rising is water-bound; largely set on a disaster-afflicted cruise liner amidst a storm tossed ocean. Being set in the burning sands of the Eygptian desert (with Morocco substituting), The Mummy does appear worlds apart.But really Sommers just cleverly tinkers with his Deep Rising template, refines a few odds and ends and voila! ... finds out he has a hit on his hands.The Mummy ramps up the humour quotient and eases back a little on the gore/horror elements of Deep Rising. Kevin J. O'Connor moves from being a comic side kick in DR to being a comic villain in TM. John Hannah, comfortably fits into the comical shoes of Jonathan Carnahan, the new bumbling side kick. Arguably the main reason for the The Mummy's success lies in the lead pairing of Brendon Fraser and Rachel Weisz. They have real onscreen chemistry and Weisz, as airy, but also feisty and smart librarian Evelyn Carnahan, proves she has the comedic talents to match those, we already knew of Fraser. Unlike Deep Rising, where the leads didn't meet up till the second half, Sommers wisely ensures this time that Fraser and Weisz team up early in the film, so we can all more fully enjoy those rom-com sparks flying.About the only character actually keeping a straight face and playing an orthodox but very convincing villain, is South African stage actor Arnold Vosloo who is Imhotep, The Mummy, aided in his role with some well executed CGI. effects.The Mummy is fast-paced from beginning to end, provides plenty of thrills, spills and laughs along the way, along with more than a touch of romance. It's lot of fun, quite charming and never pretentious. But ultimately, it reminded me of the fine movie lines that exist between hits and misses.",7,3,3,23 April 2019
Aquaman," Plunges In at the Shallow End!
","Aquaman looks a million dollars without ever looking real. We can see the film has a mega-budget, but at the same time, unlike many of the Marvel Universe films, it just doesn't look real, even during the rare times in the film where the action is on land and not in the sea. You always have the very real sense that what you are watching, was primarily played out against a green screen.The cast do their very best, whilst being saddled with some uninspiring dialogue, especially many of the Atlantean characters who just sound unintentionally (I'm sure) pompous. Jason Momoa is fine as the title character and Amber Heard is appealing as Princess Mera, his developing undersea love interest. But I would have dearly loved to have seen their characters, as well as those of Nicole Kidman and Temuera Morrison for instance play out a few more scenes on dry land.The best I can say about the production is that it is imaginative and very creatively put together in a cross-generic fashion. But herein lies one of the major problems with the movie ... its weirded out storyline. Much of this so called origin tale, seems to be an excuse to create a hybrid of styles, which I personally had great difficulty in subscribing too. The whole idea of 7 civilisations living under the sea, with advanced technology and amongst mutant species of fish and the like, which land-based society has no idea about is just bizarre (to be kind).Imagine a mix of Star Wars, with The Abyss and Clash of the Titans. Yes, Star Wars; at the bottom of the sea. If you think that'll rock your boat, you'll probably love Aquaman. Me? Much as I like a good super hero film, Aquaman just doesn't fit the bill. I'll take The Avengers before this sort of cartoonish stuff any day. The action is better choreographed, the villains more serious, the dialogue is far more consistently funny and things do seemingly appear to be occurring in the real world.",6,0,0,2 February 2019
The Doors," Morrison Hotel!
","The film's called The Doors, but it's most definitely not about The Doors. The Doors were a band that have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the '100 Greatest Artists of All Time'. Around the late 60's/1970 they were also frequently lauded as being one of the most exciting live acts in the world. If you're looking for a film to give you an inkling about such a band's history, this again, is not it.What this is, is an almost two and a half hour attempt by Oliver Stone to get inside lead singer Jim Morrison's head. Predictably to any one who knows anything about Morrison (and Stone), we get plenty of sex, drugs (including alcohol), but surprisingly not a great deal of rock 'n roll for a movie of this nature. Supposedly based on John Densmore's memoire Riders on the Storm, the film ends with a footnote thanking the surviving Doors members for their cooperation. However since its release, the Doors have criticised the film, as not truly being representative of the group nor Morrison himself.With good reason I should think. We know Morrison lived life to excess to such an extent that he died prematurely aged only 27, but do we really need the vast majority of the movie's running time to focus on that way too excessive lifestyle? We get the message very clearly early on. There's virtually no screen time focusing on the recording success of the first American band to have 8 consecutive gold records and sell over 100 million albums world-wide. The other three band members are given no back-stories and subsequently have no more than a shadowy impact in the story. I guess it is pretty difficult, when the Morrison character is almost in every scene. This is to take nothing away from Val Kilmer's wonderful performance as Jim Morrison. Besides looking incredibly like him, he does sound much the same too. Meg Ryan pops up intermittently as Morrison's (main) girlfriend (later wife) Pam, but she is given very little with which to work too. She either seems to. be in bed with Morrison or throwing things at him, just about in equal measure.Again with live performances, Stone just seems to concentrate on the controversial, headline attracting elements. The film is a bare cupboard in terms of providing evidence of the band's electric reputation as a live act.The end when it comes, rather ironically, comes very quickly. We hear a little of the group's final (very successful) album LA Woman haphazardly, as Jim attends a suburban party with the band, where he tells them he's going to Paris. Next thing we see is his Parisian grave ... The End! There is just no consistent balance to the narrative at all and in a film of this length, it really stands out.Bohemian Rhapsody tells a similar story as The Doors, but just does it so much better. It also primarily focuses on Queen's lead singer Freddy Mercury, who like Morrison lived a way too hedonistic lifestyle, also dying prematurely. But we do get a greater collective sense of the band itself and a very welcome focus on their music and live performances, which Oliver Stone's The Doors seems to completely forget about, to its detriment.",5,2,4,17 April 2019
Malcolm X," A Bloated Biopic!
","With Malcolm X, director/co-screenwriter Spike Lee has produced a true-to-life biopic on the title character who was first a strident advocate for the American Nation of Islam during the 1950's and early 60's, later becoming an extremely high profile human rights activist during the civil rights movement, before his assassination in 1965.The film dramatises key events in Malcolm X's life with the main thread beginning with his post war criminal career and later conversion to Islam whilst in jail, which directly led to his assumption of the identity of Malcolm X . Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatised in (ironically) brief flashbacks, considering the elephantine length of the rest of the film.From my understanding of the life of Malcolm X, Lee has stuck closely to the facts in constructing his biography. I believe there is only a limited amount of fictionalisation for artistic and dramatic licence. For that, I guess many will be grateful. Lee has also recreated the roughly two decades the film's story covers, extremely authentically. The sets and costuming are first class, with occasional pieces of newsreel footage and still photos supplementing that of his own filming. The performances are uniformly outstanding. Denzal Washington must have been desperately unlucky to miss out on the 1992 Academy Award for his powerful, central portrayal of the conspicuously, hard-nosed and divisive X.For me though at 202 long minutes, this film is too dragged out and warranted tighter editing. The first act focusing on his early life of crime in Harlem and later Boston is for instance, needlessly protracted with interesting, but ultimately quite unimportant night club dancing and musical interludes. Could it possibly be that its prolonged appearance is due to Spike Lee himself, appearing in this section as a supporting character?Malcolm X is a technically well-made, obvious labour of love for Lee, but I think it may have reached wider audiences if edited to a more manageable, less indulgent length.",7,1,2,7 July 2019
Nacho Libre," Signature Move!
","I guess you either like Jack Black or don't. I've never taken to him as a tough guy leading man (King Kong, hopelessly miscast), or a rom-com heart throb ( The Holiday, seriously?). He's most at home in stuff such as Nacho Libre; in your face, physical comedy with a touch of heart and soul. Having said that, I'm amazed that Nacho Libre is actually based on a true story of a real-life Mexican Catholic priest who had a 23-year career as a masked luchador and competed in order to support the orphanage he directed. Just seems fittingly bizarre.Black plays lowly regarded monk/cook Ignacio who dreams of becoming a luchador, primarily to improve the lot of the children he cares deeply for, at the same poor Mexican orphanage where he grew up. He'd also like to impress the very foxy Sister Encarnacion, a nun who teaches at the orphanage. After meeting homeless guy Steve in the back streets of the local township, they decide to take the plunge and join up as tag team partners in a local competition, with Ignacio, adopting the masked guise of wrestler Nacho Libre, to try to avoid sanctioning from monastery senior monks, who see professional wrestling as a sin of vanity.I'm the first to admit that a lot of the Black humour is pretty school yard basic. Sophistication and Jack Black don't go hand in hand. However Nacho Libre has 3 really strong positives going for it.The very well choreographed wrestling bouts and array of wrestling characters are really funny. I defy any viewers to not at least get some solid giggling going, watching them. Steven, Ignacio's usually hapless sidekick, who wrestles under the alias of Esquelet played by Hector Jimenez, is a wonderful addition to the cast and with his eternal hang dog facial expression, comes close to stealing every scene he's in. And finally, the (surprisingly) tasteful, budding romance between Ignacio and Sister Encarnacion played by the gorgeous Ana de la Reguera, gives the movie a solid emotional core.Nacho Libre is undeniably quirky and silly in large portions of screen time throughout. But even if you don't always find this type of goofy humour always agreeable it is still a sweet movie with a universal message about caring for others. And the sight of Jack Black clad in tight wrestling regalia is an image not easily forgotten.",6,0,0,20 June 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Superb Action Film!
","Besides being a terrific sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, Winter Soldier is just an absolutely pulsatingly exciting action film. The set pieces from the initial night raid on the boat through to the arguably somewhat over the top carrier v carrier ending, are just brilliantly rendered and all so varied.I love the way the Captain's story has progressed along with that of Black Widow. It makes sense that they would be thrown together in this film as neither has any sort of regular family. The introduction of Falcon was welcome and focusing quite a large element of the story around Nick Fury, also added depth to his character, whilst throwing a light on Shield operations past and present. At the same time, introducing the Winter Soldier into the mix added what is almost a touch of Shakespearian tragedy to a super-hero espionage film.For me, Captain America is the most interesting of the Avengers.We see him adjusting and adapting to life after a 70 year jump, whilst simaltaneously missing a life time of companionship with hs one true love Peggy Carter. It all serves to accentuate his humanity, which we see again when he continually questions the actions and ethics of those with whom he continuously has to deal.This is everything a big budget super hero film should be. Great job Russo Brothers!",9,1,4,18 May 2019
Over the Top," Drawing from the Bottom Deck
","This had the potential to be a fair Sly action vehicle, but the writers (include Stallone here) had to bring in the kid and turn the story into a sloppy, cliched, family bonding film.So we end up with the eminent Robert Loggia completely slumming it as the mean, irascible and extremely rich grandpa and have to put up with the bratty son Michael, who admittedly does look simply divine in that military school suit of his. (Military school? Seriously what were they thinking?) I do congratulate David Mendenhall however, for looking the part of an 11 or 12 year old. Apparently he was around 15 to 16 when the film was made, but really doesn't look like a teenager.Ultimately, we get too many weirded out supporting characters, too many slow motion arm wrestle matches, arguably too many 80's soundtrack songs, too many melodramatic moments, too many Sly long faces and too little humour to lighten the soap opera quality of the drama being presented onscreen. Underwhelming to the extreme!As an aside, another one of those movies, where the business person never seems to actually do any business. Here, Sly, a trucker, never seems to be carrying anything, anywhere to maintain his livelihood.",4,1,2,21 November 2018
Lion," A Tale of Two Movies (In One)
","Whilst as an Australian, I am pleased to see Lion was such a domestic and international commercial success, honesty behooves me in suggesting that it is one of the most over rated films I've seen in quite awhile.The first half (and with its chronologically linear structure, this is indeed a film of two distinct halves) featuring the remarkable talents of Sunny Pawar as young Saroo Brierley is brilliantly structured by debuting director Garth Davis . It's full of pathos, suspense and drama, set against a richly involving Northern Indian backdrop of both realistic rural and urban locations. The little dialogue spoken through this portion of the film is Hindi, which is entirely appropriate, as we witness the fateful occurrences which lead Saroo to be separated from his family and in due course find the boy adopted by an Australian couple from the island state of Tasmania.Greig Fraser's cinematography, as it did in the Indian first half, portrays the natural beauty of both the Tasmanian countryside and its charming capital city, Hobart, both rarely seen in contemporary Australian films. However through no fault of the actors, whose performances are never less than highly competent, it is here where the story begins to slow and then grind to its inevitable conclusion. The problem is the drama as we begin to see is relatively light weight. Boy separated from his natural family, a world away, wants, at the very least, a few answers. Arguably, in times such as they are, characterised by a high degree of international trans-migration, this is likely to be a common source of teenage angst. The suspense and unpredictable nature of the film's first half becomes lost amidst an atmosphere of one man's increasingly high anxiety.Davis and screen writer Luke Davies attempt to compensate by dialing up the human drama surrounding the adult Saroo, played very impressively by Dev Patel, whose Australian accent is surprisingly authentic. Saroo has a loose cannon adopted brother. Saroo has a supportive girl friend, with whom he breaks up and later with whom he reacquaints (Rooney Mara, who really isn't given much scope to show her acting chops here). Saroo has loving adoptive parents (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman) who also only wish the best for him. (One feels in particular, that Kidman's role as his mother Sue is clearly padded out, as arguably befitting her international star status.) All well and good, but on a dramatic level not unlike an episode of The Young and the Restless.Rarely have I seen a film of two such contrasting halves in terms of dramatic content and cinematic quality. Lion received six Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, but did not win in any of the categories. Poetic justice in my opinion. Ultimately, it didn't deserve any.",6,2,4,17 November 2018
Trouble with the Curve," Misses a Base!
","It's great seeing Clint Eastwood for one last time (apparently) with the starring role in a film, even allowing for the fact that it wasn't a commercial success. It's even better seeing him interacting in scenes with Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake, both well cast and I'm sure more than happy to be on the screen with a living legend. There's also an attractively strong support cast including John Goodman, Robert Patrick and Eastwood's own son, Scott. It's just a pity that the story they are collectively given to work with, couldn't have been stronger and more believable.I'm sorry, but I just couldn't believe a major league baseball franchise would be employing a visually-impaired octogenarian, as one of their (if not the number one) talent scouts. Clint in real life is one fit unit, but he really does look all of his 80+ years in this movie and he just doesn't fit the part. Even the oldest of his group of peers, looked 20 years younger than him. Granted the movie is at pains to tell us that his increasing blindness is only suspected by The Braves, but that whole thread just appeared pretty silly to me, especially with the narrative playing the whole thing up with car damage etc. On top of all this and the constant talk of renewed contracts, his place generally looks like a dive. Surely this 'important talent scout' is not just being paid peanuts. The inference from Phil (the ambitious bean-counter) is that the club can't afford him.Amy Adams's Mickey is welcome, but she comes draped in the familiar lawyer raiments of over-worked and under-appreciated associate being used and essentially abused by her nasty group of male partners. I'd love a dollar for every time this trope has popped up in a lawyer inclusive movie. And yes, it was deemed really important, that every lawyer we see in the movie, should have their face buried frequently in their mobile phones to the point of total distraction, observed by Eastwood's Gus, on more than one occasion.It is refreshing that the sports component of this baseball film for once doesn't include a slow-motion game climax. But at the same time, I found it hard to believe the whole thread about the Bo Gentry character being a number one draft prospect. The guy didn't even look anything like an athlete. The batter/pitcher showdown was of course very predictable.Before he passes from this mortal coil, I, more than most, would love to see Clint Eastwood, leave one last acting legacy to accompany his widely appreciated directorial skills. But it's not going to happen with lightweight, unrealistic tales such as Trouble with the Curve is, pleasant, (almost family) entertainment though it may be, in a non-threatening way.",6,0,0,21 January 2020
Pitch Black," Shine a Light!
","Nearly 20 years on, Pitch Black still shines as a compelling, original piece of science-fiction film-making, which ended up spawning 2 and a bit sequels. Of real interest is seeing the introduction and early positioning of our favourite Furyan, Richard P Riddick, as very much an anti-hero for much of the movie's length. In the sequels, the spotlight positions him more as a traditional hero. Pitch Black is also notable for both a fine performance from Radha Mitchell as Pilot Carolyn Fry and the contribution of the desolate terrain around the South Australian desert town of Coober Pedy, very effectively passing itself off as the three-sunned barren planet.Indeed though Pitch Black is ostensibly an American production, it has a very significant Australian element, besides the locations. Radha Mitchell and many of the cast members are Australian, as is musical director Graeme Revell, not forgetting the very talented cinematographer David Eggby. Mention of the cast members reminds me that Pitch Black is much more of an ensemble piece than subsequent Riddick episodes. As such the various characters are given differing back stories which do pique our interest. No one, least of all Riddick, is totally heroic. Even Mitchell's Fry (her best screen role IMHO), contemplates ditching her passengers, to better ensure her personal survival chances, in the film's harrowing opening scenes.The story, though reminiscent of parts of Alien, confidently treads its own survivalist narrative path, once the damaged space ship crash lands unexpectedly mid-journey. Good to see, the creatures when they appear aren't Alien inspired clones, like so many other examples from creature features over the past few decades, such as the very recent, disappointing Life. The spine-tingling night time odyssey back to the repaired drop ship in the film's second half is a mini-masterpiece of suspense, pitting the disparate, rag tag humans (+Riddick) against their horrendous extra terrestrial hosts.Vin Diesel arguably has achieved greater fame and financial success through his involvement in the Fast and Furious franchise. But for me, up till the present, the most interesting character he has brought to the screen is the always enigmatic Riddick, as first seen in Pitch Black.",8,1,2,13 March 2019
U-571," Fires All Tubes!
","Forget the history aspect and just accept that this is a completely fictitious story, which it is. In this way you are far more likely to enjoy the very entertaining and suspenseful U-571. Factual accuracy is not a strong point of this film. What is a strong point however is the clever and unorthodox employment of typical submarine film genre tropes, to create a tense, absorbing war drama, with plenty of action and unexpected twists.The U - 571 is a World War II German submarine boarded by American submariners to capture her Enigma cipher machine. In an extended prologue we see her and her crew attacking an Allied convoy in the Atlantic Ocean, but sustaining badly damaged engines in escaping. A distress call for assistance from the German Navy is intercepted by American naval intelligence, who hatch a plan to use the crew of American sub S-33 to try to steal the Enigma machine coding device and sink the U-571 through subterfuge, before German assistance arrives on the scene.Matthew McConaughey is Lieutenant Andrew Tyler the ambitious, but socially popular XO of the S-33, skippered by the ever reliably stoic Bill Paxton playing Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren. But the talented cast list, like the submarines, is long and deep. There is plenty of well choreographed and photographed action both above and below the ocean surface and in and out of various submarines. Challengers to survival for the S-33 crew arrive from depth charge, cannon and other torpedo attacks, as well as those caused by onboard fires and explosions, the machinations of untrustworthy prisoners and even a possible mutiny amongst various sailors.While there have been better war films over the years, U-571 is a well-paced, stirring and at times exhilarating adventure that never lets up from start to cessation of action. Worth putting your shoulder to the wheel for this one.",7,0,2,27 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," Second Thoughts
","I have to admit, that over the years I've changed my thoughts about Quantum of Solace. Loving Casino Royale and the Daniel Craig - inspired Bond reboot, I was really looking forward to the follow-up, only to be initially disappointed, like so many others, with the frantic pacing and editing, especially of the all important action sequences.Regarding those action set pieces, I must be getting used to the manner in which they're staged. These days, I find them pretty accomplished, although I don't deny the producers and director were obviously influenced by the success of the Bourne franchise in constructing them. But their breadth, scale and variety as seen in the movie are quite staggering. Whatever else it is and may be isn't, in my view, Quantum of Solace is one very good action movie. Savage hand to hand combat, metal-crunching car chases, bone-shaking boat chases where you almost swear you've been sprayed by salt water, aerial dog fights culminating in a breath-taking sky-dive sequence, not forgetting your traditional gun battles, this, the shortest of Bond movies, just about has it all.It's certainly not flawless by any means. As inferred I can understand the criticisms concerning the rapid-fire editing, even if I've acquiesced towards it over the years. I believe there should have been a stronger introductory connection/mini-recap to the previous Casino Royale, rather than the void with which we have to deal. And I know after 22 films, directors do find the need to repeat themselves. But seriously did we really need a virtual recreation of the gold-painted murdered girl from Goldfinger, in oil, in this film? I also think there did need to be some clearer, perhaps slower-paced intervals of exposition, just to make the narrative more user-friendly. In Quantum, these episodes generally occur when Bond has got a drink in his mouth, or when he's communicating to his HQ, in the middle of one of those afore-mentioned chases.However if you want to see Daniel Craig reinforce his nailing of the James Bond persona, if you want to appreciate some great interchanges between Bond and M, marvel at some brilliant location set-ups as well as excellent sets (eg MI-6) besides take-ing the opportunity to apprize the first sequel in the Bond franchise, Quantum of Solace just may be the movie for you.",8,5,7,1 April 2019
Zulu," Drums Across the Valley!
","I recently had the opportunity of seeing a restored version of Cy Endfield's epic tale of The Battle of Rorke's Drift and just have to say at the outset, that it looks magnificent. If ever a film was highlighted to depict it's locations to optimal advantage, Zulu would be up near the top of the list. Largely filmed by cinematographer Stephen Dade in the nearby Drakensberg Mountains, the scenery is never less than spectacular, whilst the sets faithfully recreate the small settlement of Rorke's Drift.The other beauty of this film and arguably the reason Zulu is still so highly regarded 55 years after its initial release is its intelligent screenplay. Though clearly taking a British perspective of the battle, it is careful to never disrespect the Zulu culture. From the extended first act mass weddings to the extensive detailing of the Zulu battle strategies, the film takes a fairly even-handed approach to to the concept of colonial imperialism, neither condoning it, nor denying the ambitions of the British power intruding into a foreign land.As is usual in historical depictions of past events, liberties are taken to increase the dramatic impact of scenes. But in Zulu, these are relatively minor. Ironically one of the more obvious examples, is that the British body count onscreen is clearly far nigher than it was during the actual battle, when remarkably only 15 were killed.Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are both excellent as the junior officers leading the defence, again renewing a collaboration begun in a similar themed movie from the previous decade called A Hill in Korea. Baker, who also co-produced the film obviously knew pretty early on, that he was on to something good. It's pity that his premature death stopped him from pursuing the sequel, which later turned into the inferior prequel Zulu Dawn. One can't help feeling that if Baker had had the opportunity to produce, it would have been a much better production. Nigel Green as the phlegmatically patient and calm Colour sergeant Frank Bourne is also outstanding, but I do wonder, as apparently Jack Hawkins did himself, why so much onscreen time, for relatively little outcome is devoted to the drunken Reverend Witt. It just seems distracting to focus so much on a (likely) fictional, unsympathetic character, who disappears into the dust prior to the main battle beginning.The second half of Zulu is dedicated to the battle and again one has to be impressed in the manner in which the action, pretty much parallels what occurred in real life. Both sides are seen to be highly disciplined in their actions, with the point being made, as many military historians have concluded, that the British prevailed, in what became and is depicted, as desperate hand to hand combat, through the deadly use of their bayoneted rifles. The long percussive Zulu War chant heralding the onset of the Zulu attack still has the power to provoke a foreboding sense of dread, even for one who has seen the film many times.Sad that due to the Apartheid and strict censorship laws instituted in South Africa during the 60's, many of the Zulu actors were never able to see the production, their participation was so fundamental too. One hopes that many were later able to do so, after the dismantling of Apartheid in the early 1990's.",9,0,1,17 December 2019
It Follows," A Major Disappointment!
","I wouldn't normally even bother to review a film already critiqued by 800+ contributors, but I was so disappointed by It Follows that I found myself gravitating towards the keyboard, to express my feelings of surprised dismay.Touted regularly as a 'modern classic', those expecting another genuinely original film such as Get Out! should be prepared for disappointment.The main narrative premise of a 'viral villainous curse' passed between teenagers, has most obviously and best been seen in The Ring saga. The story therefore can claim no great pretensions to originality. But the way it is presented to the audience is completely and frustratingly daft.Consider: 1 The virtual complete absence of adult support characters. These school going teenagers have apparently no parents from whom to seek advice or get some help. They appear to just about all live in Jay's house. Convenient I suppose, but realistic? 2 The (adult) police can't find Hugh/Jeffrey, but our teenage posse can. Sure! 3 Many have already noted the absence of any explanation at all for the existence of the curse (a major point of difference with The Ring). I could probably live with that, but curiously again there seems little police involvement with the associated deaths, such as we see in the film's introduction. 4 Jay's continually bizarre behaviour is something to behold. She always seems to be running out on her buddies, even when they get shot/injured attempting to help her with naturally, precious little thanks. 5 And what's with the two main male friends trying to bed Jay when they know she's been cursed? One even quite hilariously mounts her in her hospital bed, when she's recovering from a car crash. Shades of David Lynch! It makes little sense. 6 As do the 'its', when in one scene bullets to the head cause only a minor inconvenience, whilst in another scene, we're expected to believe it's finished one off. Duh! 7 As for the so called symbolism of 'purposely' highlighted superseded technologies and SF/Horror references ... seriously what was the point? In your face stuff, that's all been done before in much better films.It follows therefore that I strongly advise you don't bother.",4,2,3,18 October 2018
Room," Stepped Into the Wrong Room!
","I can appreciate all the critical love for Room, even if I can't agree with it.What I can subscribe to, is that the film is anchored by two wonderful central performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.And though I haven't read Emily Donoghue's adapted novel, I applaud director Lenny Abrahamson's reported decision to upgrade Ma's role for the screen version. For me, it's the complex character of Ma/Joy that holds major interest, rather than 5 year old Jack, through whose perspective we view much of the action. We are told very early on in the second of two clearly defined halves of Room, that young Jacob is resilient and very likely to shake off the effects of 5 years of confinement with his mother. We (at least me anyway) don't need huge amounts of onscreen time devoted to watching Jack atune to his new environment. It's here the film really falls down, with a now plodding pace, as Ma disappears from the screen for very large tracts of time.Of far more importance and interest was exploring the more edgy personality of Ma and the vast challenges, which are really only paid lip service, on her repatriation from capture. A bit of a spat with her mum and a testy TV interview and all of a sudden Joy disappears for way too much of the second half, when things were just starting to get interesting.Without turning Room into a police procedural, I think the movie could have spent a little more time following up the arrest (and likely conviction) of Old Nick. His character generates much of the suspense and he goes virtually unreferenced in the film's second half. In fact the only indirect link is when Ma and Jack return to the room with the police at the end of the film. It looks so ramshackle and flimsy, that even I found myself wondering how Joy had not really managed to create any other escape attempts. It just didn't have the appearance of a virtual escape-proof cell.Room is an unconventional and very professionally produced vehicle about a none too uncommon issue which has affected many women and children over the years. But for me any thriller/suspense elements disappeared when characters such as Ma and Old Nick were off screen, so as to allow an unfettered, somewhat repetitive look at Jack, adjusting to his brave, new world.",6,0,1,3 October 2019
Meet Joe Black," Prefer to, at a Much Later Time!
","'This is crazy,' says Anthony Hopkins's character Bill Parrish, a billionaire media mogul to titular character Joe Black, at a fairly early stage of this extraordinarily long remake of the clever, 1934 relatively short film, Death Takes a Holiday. He already knew something many viewers probably didn't. They were in for a very extended, lengthy, muddled ride watching a hugely tedious, undramatic and unromantic film, whereby Death (Joe Black - Brad Pitt) drops into the Land of the Free, to be tutored in ways human, by Bill Parrish and later, his lovely daughter Susan.Producer/director Martin Brest had a relatively brief ride amongst the Hollywood elites. He made 2 very good action comedies, Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run and an OK drama, in Scent of a Woman, all consecutively. From there, starting from this film it was all downhill, ending terminally with the catastrophic Gigli. He hasn't really been heard from since. All the signs pointing to a decline are on show here in this ponderous, pretentious affair.For a start considering it was made in 1998 for a then, pretty staggering $90 million, it's one of those productions where you just can't see where the money has gone. It does have some opulent sets and locations in a Rhode Island mansion, but so do other films with much smaller budgets. Salaries? Reshoots? I don't know, but unsurprisingly it was a troubled shoot.It has 2 extremely bankable stars in Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. Hopkins is as serviceable as ever and undoubtedly would entertain reading a telephone directory. Pitt is not miscast, but I feel hopelessly misdirected. He is asked to play Death as this naive, virginal, neophyte, when the opposite, most certainly could have applied. The eternal Grim Reaper should have been seen as being the epitome of intelligence, charm and attractive menace, especially after his early library introduction with Parrish, when he is invisible. This results in a couple of hours of 'awkward' between Pitt and co-star Claire Forlani (who really tries her hardest) as Susan, instead of rebirthing the sexy chemistry, we'd been led to believe had been established by the earlier cafe scenes. And speaking of 'awkward', how about that absurd road accident? Junkies, drunks, fugitives from the law maybe, but sane individuals don't stand in the middle of a busy road, completely love-struck and wait patiently to be run over.There are sub-plots; which have all the repetition and dramatic heft of your regular daytime TV soaps. I'd like a dollar for every time we saw Pitt and Hopkins standing/sitting bemusedly in a board room meeting in Meet Joe Black. And Marcia Gay Harden's character of Allison, Susan's sister, is (for a 3 hour film), ironically underwritten and generally ill-used.Laughably Martin Brest apparently took offence at some of the airlines and TV stations who tried to do him a favour and did their own 2 hour edits of the movie. Seems he was incapable of picking up the message that there may have been a few decent ideas in Meet Joe Black that should have been delivered in a more simple and lean package.",4,0,0,23 May 2020
Children of Men," Up Against the Wall!
","Time has only demonstrated some of the realities of the prophetic nature of Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men, especially in regards to the global waves of immigrants seeking a better life and/or refuge especially in North American and European countries.This grim, bleak film is arguably the best imagining of an urban society facing its descent into anarchy. We see an increasingly, we gather, dictatorial British Government in 2027, being besieged by various activist groups, the most militant being The Fishes. Simultaneously, it is also dealing failingly with huge social upheavels brought about by mass waves of immigrants and a human race trying to adjust to 18 years of female sterility.This is the background setting for the film which follows the personal journey of Theo, a fearful, cynical, one time activist, who reluctantly becomes the personal guardian of both a mother and her new born, who just may hold the keys to the salvation of humanity. If this sounds like a Nativity story, that's because it is; a Nativity story set in a semi-anarchistic state, with Theo played by Clive Owen, being a Joseph like figure to Kee's Mary and her child Dylan, a Jesus substitute.Though the film is full of religious symbolism and overtones, the story is quite secular in nature. The film's second and third acts essentially constitute a chase film, but one filmed with an extremely documentary type feel. The camera work is remarkable, but again, very consistent with many of Cuarón's other work. Hand - held cameras are frequently employed but not in the choppy, rapid-fire editing style of many other contemporary works. Cuarón continues to demonstrate in Children of Men, his love for elaborately long tracking shots, as seen in his other films such as Gravity. It makes for some fascinating viewing.The narrative is less objective with some of the characters' and groups' actions and motivations not always clearly or easily explained.This, in addition to the fact that there is never any explanation offered for female sterility, nor for Kee being able to conceive (thus paralleling the biblical Immaculate Conception).Children of Men is truly a cinematic project with most critics acknowledging that it is a far superior piece of work, than its source novel written by PD James, more famous for her mystery tales. Those wishing to see some extremely complex, but successfully shot dramatic and action sequences could do far worse than give this film your attention.",7,0,2,7 April 2019
Where Eagles Dare," 'Broadsword Calling Danny Boy!'
","It's fictional, as were Alistair MacLean's other great war stories, but what's unique about Where Eagles Dare is that he also wrote the screenplay (in fact prior to writing the novel). Along with director Brian G Hutton, he created the basis of a two and a half hour+ movie which fairly hums along, not just because of the plentiful action scenes, but because of the intriguing plot line, that just keeps unfolding right up to the last couple of onscreen minutes.We are literally dropped into the action, along with the British/American extraction team shortly after the opening credits. There is only one brief flashback to sketch out the mission details for us, so we gain more narrative information as the movie timeline progresses, just as Clint Eastwood's Lt Schaffer does. Speaking of Eastwood, this was one of 3 films released in 1968, he had major roles in, that really consolidated his accession to the Hollywood 'A' list, after he'd made a name for himself in European films. Sharing the lead with Richard Burton was a successful marriage of convenience, as one can't quite imagine Clint pulling off the longish, but necessary expository scenes, such as that around the fire in the Nazi drawing room, quite as well as Burton's Major Smith. That sort of stuff was second nature to the Shakespearian - trained Burton, whilst Eastwood contentedly added to his taciturn, but quietly threatening onscreen persona.The trademark MacLean twists come thick and fast in the second half of the film, as does the action which ramps up quite a deal, culminating in the extended escape episode from the Schloß Adler, a mountaintop fortress accessible only by cable car or helicopter. And the onscreen action and tensity is only enhanced by Ron Goodwin's well-known soundtrack.Where Eagles Dare and his follow-up film Kelly's Heroes are the two war films for undoubtedly which director Hutton is most famous. Besides both involving a collaboration with Clint Eastwood, they are generally recognised as being popular modern classics of the genre. Though not necessarily artistically great, they have great entertainment value, which 50 years of time passing, hasn't affected in the least. Definitely worth a look!",7,2,2,29 April 2019
Limitless," SciFi v Action
","The concept underpinning Limitless has universal appeal. What if we could make maximum use of those unused portions of the brain we rarely call upon? Unsurprisingly the idea has attracted movie-makers periodically, for decades. In 1996 for instance Jon Turteltaub, made the pretty successful Phenomenon with John Travolta, which, whilst utilising the same basic premise as Limitless, eschewed the thriller aspects almost completely, concentrating on creating a romantic drama. In Luc Besson's Lucy, the sci fi prospects of the intelligence gain are amped up to what I reckon, were ridiculous levels. It becomes unsurprisingly very much an excessive, special effects driven extravaganza.Limitless treads more middle ground. In my opinion it succeeds better in the first half, where Bradley Cooper's Eddie acquires the NZT and we see him on a number of occasions literally metamorphose before our eyes. I like the way director Neil Burger achieves this effect without a deluge of special effects; instead relying on Cooper's acting skills and smarts, upping the tempo and content of spoken dialogue and the use of filters to alter the lighting, along with changes in music and sound effects. Cooper needs special praise here. His performance does much to convince us of the drug's possible benefits to humanity.Somewhere along the production planning though, it was decided by the studio, to turn the movie into an action thriller. As such, it's not a bad one, although it embraces plenty of familiar tropes ( violent Russian hoods, greedy corporations etc.) and relies on some pretty banal plot contrivances to change the movie's tone and direction. Seriously, nothing could convince me, that the new Renaissance Eddie would deliberately seek out a Russian loan shark to obtain more seed money and later forget to pay him back on time. Stuff like this and the arriving police not searching Eddie after he calls in a homicide, make us realise how an up till then smart movie, is suddenly being dumbed down, perhaps in an effort to win over the multi-plex crowds.The conclusion is simply pure Hollywood and I have to say that while I overall liked both movies and found them entertaining, Phenomenon had a much more, sober, realistic finish than Limitless.",6,1,1,15 February 2019
The Descent," Tunnel Rats!
","Neil Marshall follows his equally good variant on the werewolf theme, Dog Soldiers, with The Descent. This all female lead cast movie, follows six women who, having entered a cave system, struggle to survive against the humanoid creatures living inside. The beauty of the film is that whilst attempting to survive the cannibalistic monsters, the women also find themselves hamstrung by the impetuous actions of one of their own. It's a good story, which Marshall chooses to primarily film through the perspective of Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), who a year previously, tragically lost her husband and daughter in a rather horrid car accident. Thus the ostensible premise behind the spelunking expedition in the Appalachin Mountains; to assist the damaged Sarah to regain at least part of her adventurous mojo, which we see on display in an exciting white-water rafting sequence in the opening scenes.Marshall assembles a cosmopolitan cast of women which assists identification purposes later during the cave scenes, though it might be considered a little unusual, in that not one of the women is American, seeing the vast majority of the film is set in the U.S.A., (with Scotland and England locations subbing in well). The purpose stage-built 'cave system' works outstandingly well conjuring up a sea of subterranean terror with its terrifying, underground inhabitants.Both Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza who plays the other key role of Juno, the tough, but manipulative leader of the expedition are excellent in their parts. The interrelationship of their characters is only revealed towards the end and it is fascinating watching the metamorphosis of Sarah's character, as she rises to both the challenges of 'the crawlers' and the woman she once thought of and trusted as a friend.The Descent is an exhilarating, gut-wrenching, thrill-ride of a horror story and serves once again to demonstrate Neil Marshall is a talented director, who lucky for us, is not satisfied working with established tropes of the horror genre.",8,0,0,21 March 2020
Jack Reacher," Jack (Wayne) Reacher: Rides In and Rides Out!
","Jack Reacher is a very entertaining adaption of Lee Child's novel One Shot and good introduction to Child's iconic character of the same name. I very much liked the way director/writer Christopher McQuarrie through judicious and economic editing, introduced and backgrounded Reacher in the first act, at all times faithfully adhering to the template of Reacher, as outlined in the long-running and internationally successful line of books ... except for one crucial aspect.Yes, the elephant in the room is the contrast of the literary Reacher's physical size and appearance, as opposed to actor Tom Cruise's relatively diminutive dimensions. In this case size does matter, as Reacher's size and physical abilities and attributes are somewhat metaphorical in depicting the force of nature and barely disguised almost superman aspects of his persona. Without a doubt, accomplished actor that he is, Cruise grasps the psychological make-up and enigmatic social behaviour of Reacher extremely well. But with his movie star charisma and 5 foot 7 inch height, he was never really going to convince diehard Reacher fans of a physical connection to the character, though he gives it his best shot (pun intended) in both this movie and the sequel Never Go Back.It's no surprise that for any future instalments, even Lee Child, who was initially quite buoyant and positive about Cruise's casting, has admitted, will be dependent on a new actor taking over the role. My personal choice for a very long time, has been Arnie Hammer. I think he ticks just about all the boxes.At any rate having led the elephant back to his enclosure, I can reiterate that this is a good movie; well-directed with a fine cast and an intriguing storyline. Rosamund Pike and Robert Duvall are the stand-outs in a quality support line-up and both demonstrate notable chemistry in their interactions with Cruise's Reacher. The John Wayne western style references are obvious in Reacher's entry into the narrative and his exit along the motorway sunset towards future adventures, not to mention his propensity to take the law into his own hands, to achieve what in his eyes, is a fair and just outcome.Though both Reacher films feature well-choreographed and realistic action scenes, only One Shot, really highlights that other really important part of the Reacher character; his great detective skills, which are a fundament of the books. So appreciate Cruise's game efforts in this, his first of two Reacher outings. But be prepared for some future casting changes which, as a big fan myself, will hopefully enable Jack Reacher to continue to forge ahead into the cinematic universe.",8,3,4,1 October 2019
The Departed," Never Forget The Departed!
","My favourite, of a great list of Scorsese films and what do you know; it's a brilliant remake of a very good Hong Kong film, Infernal Affairs. Many who read and write these reviews will know and understand, that more often than not, American remakes of Asian/European films are inferior for a host of reasons; but not always. The Departed is one of those rare birds, whose quality outshines the very worthy original work.The casting is impeccable. Leonardo DiCaprio as William 'Billy' Costigan; has there ever been a more convincing performance of an undercover cop living on the edge? Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan, playing very much against his usual more heroic self, in his cocky, smarmy portrayel of an inside man of the most dangerous type. Who could imagine anyone other than Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello, the ruthless Irish gangland boss with some deep dark secrets of his own. And the lesser lights, Mark Wahlberg very much deserving of his Oscar nomination for his very physical, bullying Dignam. Vera Farmiga's cogent role-playing of Madolyn so persuasive that we can believe the unlikely private relationships she develops with both Costigan and Sullivan. Ray Winstone, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin; the list just goes on. All perfectly cast and repaying us with memorable characters.Scorsese has created a two and a half hour film that just bristles with suspense and creative, believable twists, that ramp up the thrill levels to a breathless high, before delivering a hugely satisfactory triple play climax, topped off with the symbolic rat running across the Boston Skyline. The pace never slackens and as usual his musical choices are flawless, never failing to enhance the onscreen action.A number of critics observed that Scorsese's Academy Award for Best Director of The Departed was rather a career acknowledgement than anything else. Don't be fooled. Both Martin Scorsese and his film deserved their oscars. He has created a dazzling, gritty, engrossing gangster thriller that never fails to both surprise and entertain. It's a must see.",10,0,2,13 March 2020
The Witch," Excitingly Original But Aurally Challenging.
","This is a creatively fresh entry into the all too frequently cliched horror genre. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting from the small main cast, the original storyline and the historical authenticity brought to the production. However this high regard doesn't extend to the supposedly seventeenth century English dialogue spoken by the characters. I've generally got a pretty good ear for English dialects, but have to confess in this film I only understood around about 25% of what was spoken onscreen. It wasn't just the dialogue itself. It was also the rapidity and pitch with which the words were enunciated which annoyed me. I really would have preferred to be reading sub-titles and since I wasn't watching a DVD, this wasn't possible. It's a pity, because apart from this and the somewhat over-the-top conclusion, which didn't really seem to fit with the ambiguous nature of the rest of the picture, this was a pretty interesting offering.",7,0,2,3 November 2018
Crazy Heart," Ramblin' Man!
","In the space of a year Jeff Bridges gave 2 standout performances and in doing so, created 2 classic characters; Bad Blake in Crazy Heart and shortly thereafter, the definitive portrayal of Rooster Cogburn (surpassing that of the Duke's in my estimation) in the Coen Brothers remake of True Grit. Both were Oscar - winning acts, but he did in fact take it for Bad Blake and how well-deserved it is.Bridges just totally adopts the persona of the alcoholic singer-songwriter who was once a country music star, but now is just well and truly over the hill and heading for skid row, if he isn't already there. Besides the quality acting which you always get from Bridges anyway, there's the musicianship on show. He obviously knows his way around a guitar, is clearly comfortable playing with a variety of musicians and has a voice just made for a country and western veteran, who's seen better days.Bridges carries this well-directed film from writer/director Scott Cooper, but he receives some wonderful support in the process. Maggie Gyllenhaal is sensational as Blake's love interest Jean Craddock, a youngish journalist and writer, as well as single mother, with a four-year-old son, Buddy. Irishman, Colin Farrell, is also surprisingly persuasive as Tommy Sweet, a new country star and former protege of Blake's. In a lovely touch Robert Duvall turns up for just a few beautifully written scenes, as a longtime friend of Blake's through thick and thin. In casting Duvall, Cooper undoubtedly pays a very respectful homage to Tender Mercies, Duvall's 1983 film for which he also won an Oscar, playing a somewhat similar character to Blake, but one who'd already started his journey to personal redemption.If you appreciate country music, you're just about guaranteed to love Crazy Heart. There is plenty of music and musicianship on show with some great songs and fine playing from a cavalcade of country and western stars, in cameo roles as backing musos. This is my favourite country music themed movie, with Bridges's amazing performance the number one reason. Some may feel that at 7/10, I may well be underscoring the film and that could well be true. But along with others, I do feel the story is pretty derivative (see comments above about Tender Mercies for example) though always engaging. It shouldn't stop interested punters from feeling for the Crazy Heart.",7,0,0,7 May 2020
Parasite," Over-rated!
","Parasite is a fine example of Korean cinema and an entertaining, cross-generic piece with overt Hitchcock influences, but the best film of 2019 and the best screenplay? Well, I'm sorry I don't think so. Not by a long way.It's very professionally made and the main themes of class conflict, social inequality and wealth disparity are hard to miss. But that's the thing; for a film that's won an Oscar for best screenplay, there's precious little subtlety or nuance on show. Mrs Park is simply depicted as an air-headed social matriarch, with Mr Park, who's supposedly had the brains and initiative to start up a successful multi-national company, not much better.The Kims on the other all seem exceedingly bright, sharp as tacks, in spite of their living conditions which can only be described as basement third world in a first world economy. I'm not doubting the existence of the banjiha, but seeing the Kims continually lob up to work, so fashionably and immaculately dressed in clean pressed clothes and so intelligently well-spoken hardly rings true. This is before and after their abode (and presumably their wardrobes) have been entirely flooded with sewage.For me, all the best storylines generally have more distinctive shading of characters and behaviours; not the absolute stark contrasts between the haves and have nots, on display in Parasite. And I need to emphasise here that I'm talking about intelligences too, not just material possessions and finances.A film such as 1917 dazzled me in places, to the extent, that I was wondering 'how they managed to do such and such a sequence?' I was entertained by Parasite, but never enthralled, by what many critics were and are still saying is a 'near-perfect' picture. I can't agree with this sort of summation. Having said that, I must confess to having a leaning towards seeing the black and white edit, that is supposedly going to be on offer later this year. I am intrigued to see whether a look at that might alter my perspective somewhat.",7,3,6,6 March 2020
The Woman in Black," A Long Black Veil!
","The Woman In Black is a great little unpretentious spook fest well worth your attention. It has a fine cast, evocatively interesting locations and sets and first rate cinematography. Most importantly director James Watkins has sensibly concentrated on slowly building an atmosphere of generally unseen dread and terror, rather than turning the film into some sort of special effects extravaganza. In this respect the film might be described as being a traditional ghost story, reinforced by the Edwardian English time setting of the piece. But this certainly is not to detract from the quality of this creepy tale of a young, recently widowed lawyer who travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.Daniel Radcliffe well and truly casts aside his Harry Potter persona to play lawyer Arthur Kipps, still semi-depressed and mourning his young wife Stella, who died 4 years earlier giving birth to their son. The film is centred around his character and requires a great deal of adroit use of facial and body expressiveness, as he is the sole (human) character on screen for long periods. This is a movie, not over-burdened with reams of dialogue. Ciaran Hinds is on hand though, to give fine support playing local landowner Sam Daily, one of the few local people willing to assist Arthur attempt to complete his tasks for his London law firm, despite his family also being tragically affected by The Woman in Black.The film was both a critical and commercial success and I have to admit I'm surprised James Watkins doesn't have a higher cinema profile, having only directed one feature since. He seems to have a strong understanding of what constitutes a good film, with an easily appreciated example, being the inclusion of the sad/happy ending, rather than just going for some sort of shock finale. Watching The Woman in Black may well see you adding a bit of colour to your regular movie diet.",8,1,2,14 May 2019
Mother!," Oh Dear Mother!
","Yes, it's a biblical allegory and yes, it's a film that will polarise. It's really not all that original and pays all manner of homages to directors such as Pasolini, Bunuel and Polanski (In other words, in its own way, it's pretty derivative.). In my opinion it really only has one thing going for it and that is a fantastic performance from Jennifer Lawrence.Take a look at the main poster/DVD cover. That clues you in to what you are going to be dealt with in Mother! It's a close-up of Lawrence's face. Be prepared for around 90% of the cinematography, being hand-held close-ups of mainly faces. It makes for a dizzying, claustrophobic experience as we follow Lawrence and any number of her unwanted guests around the confines of the large, country house in which virtually all the onscreen action occurs.The biblical references and parallels are obvious and arguably different for those expecting a more traditional horror movie. But have no misconceptions, this is no Rosemary's Baby. I just didn't enjoy the story of Mother's continual mistreatment, degradation and fate dealt out by her poet husband and his growing band of sycophantic fans, admirers and general hangers-on. It really was unpleasant and not in the least bit entertaining. But I can't deny that Mother will provoke discussion and debate, so it does have some merit.Most deserving of merit though is Lawrence. She totally carries the movie and is virtually in every scene. Forget Javier Bardem; his role probably could just about have been played by any reasonable actor. Likewise Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer come and go and are really just there for their names. Lawrence however gives an acting tour-de-force and is just so watchable. Considering her contribution and the film's content, it is completely understandable that she would want to have a break from acting, as she did, after completing this film.The greatest mystery with Mother! is not the storyline. For me, it's how Jennifer Lawrence ended up being nominated for a Razzie Lead Actress award for her role. it's the most laughably daft decision the Razzie organisers have ever made. All they succeeded in doing by this unwarranted slap in the face for a very talented actress, is to most deservedly get the proverbial egg splattered over their own metaphorical faces.",5,2,3,5 November 2019
The Purge," Original Concept; Execution the Problem!
","The Purge is one of those minority films that has a better ending than beginning. I came to the film enthusiastically, though knowing little about it. However the idea of a family who find themselves endangered by a gang of murderers during the annual Purge, a night during which all crime, including murder, is temporarily legal seemed really intriguing to me; especially considering America's collective love of all things to do with guns, ammunition and the right to bear arms. The Sandin family set-up is good too, with dad James a very successful entrepreneur, whose company specialises in home security systems, specifically designed to offer protection during The Purge.Unfortunately the main storyline's implementation relies frustratingly again on the eternal trope of the 'naughty children'. So we have son Charlie, who's clearly supposed to be at least 12/13 in the movie and a nerd who likes to play with electronic toys. Now despite needing to have Dad explain to him what The Purge is at the start of the movie (to give us valuable exposition), he unilaterally decides to turn off the security. Yes, somehow he already knows the access codes and decides the family will handle things differently. BTW after this occurs and creates all manner of chaos, Dad never has a critical word to say to the brat.Speaking of brats, we haven't spoken about daughter Zoey yet, who is also a unique piece of work. Although Dad doesn't approve of her boyfriend, of course she knows better. Then when said boyfriend tries to kill her father during The Purge but is grieviously wounded himself, what does she do? Yes, she runs away into the mansion-sized house, worrying about the murderous boyfriend's health and not her father's. She spends much of the rest of the movie running away from anyone who's actually likely to offer her protection. She's worse than a damsel in distress; more like a moron in distress.Mom played by Lena Headey, until very late in the third act, plays a stereotypically indecisive, dithering woman, very much the polar opposite of her infamous Game of Thrones persona, Cersei Lannister. She does a lot of nervous creeping around the house with a gun in her hand ... but not much else. Most of the heavy lifting in terms of decisive action is taken by Ethan Hawke's James and let it be said; he does a pretty good job. Also smarmily good is chief villain 'The Polite Stranger', though it's difficult to see how he inspires much loyalty amongst his gang of thugs, when he's shown to off one for a minor infraction, within the blink of an eye.What lifts The Purge in overall quality is an excellent third act, where we actually are given several reasonably unexpected plot twists which ramp up the suspense and interest quotient accordingly. The quality of the action improves too. Early in the film there are a couple of really badly-lit, choppily edited sequences, whereas in the back half, we start to actually see who's attacking who and what they are doing about it; always a help. Even the post - credit soundtrack adds to the overall calibre of the tale.Many will be aware that due to the success of this first film, a franchise was created with the immediate sequel, The Purge:Anarchy supposedly being even better than this one. I just might be tempted after seeing this, given half a chance.",6,1,1,27 March 2020
Godzilla," The Poster Doesn't Lie!
","I have to preface this review by fessing up that I've never really been a Godzilla fan, though I don't mind occasionally watching out of curiosity some of the 50's Japanese incarnations of the big guy.What I really don't get about this movie though is that it had a $160 million budget and yet we don't really get to see much of the big set action pieces, because they're all set at night and happen in near darkness. Have a look at the Godzilla poster. That'll give you an idea of what to expect. If your idea of fun is peering into a dark screen and imagining you can make out what is happening with the monster mash occurring, then you'll probably love it. I couldn't help myself from glancing at my watch.BTW there are some human characters. It's almost fraud to say the movie features Juliette Binoche. She is criminally underused and only has a brief few scenes and in most of those she wears a radiation protection suit. Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play the perfunctory happily married couple with a cute kid, who are separated by the unfolding narrative and spend much of the remainder of the movie trying to reunite, in between dodging crashing skyscrapers. In truth they had far better back stories and stronger chemistry playing the sibling super heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Ken Watanabe is on hand as a token Japanese character who has a perpetual worried look on his face.In case anyone was wondering, for the umpteenth time in an SF film the Golden Gate Bridge cops a flogging again. And the odd tsunami (which has become THE go-to disaster vehicle of the 2010's) pops up to add extra havoc to the general goings on.It's pretty obvious I was unimpressed with Godzilla. But I have to admit the big guy still has his rabid following around the world, especially in the Asian markets, which helped the film make a marginal profit.All I can say, is that these audiences are very easily satisfied by a very ordinary film.",4,0,1,15 December 2018
Annihilation," A Heroic Failure!
","I really wanted to like Annhilation and there is plenty to like about this sophomore production from director/writer Alex Garland. But overall I do have to agree with many of the reviewers on these pages, in that I think the professional critics have been a little over-generous in their collective praise of Annihilation. And ironically the main weakness of the movie in my view, is the screenplay, which is normally one of Garland's great strengths.The film looks great for an ambitious, mid-budget sci-fi project. The soundtrack is also a winner ranging from the very appropriate use of some early Crosby, Stills and Nash material, to a mind-expanding tonal smorgasboard in the latter stages of the film. I have no problem either, with what I believe is the fairly unlikely scenario of a 5 women unit group of (mainly) scientists who enter 'The Shimmer', a mysterious quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals caused by an alien presence. It's just that the execution of the story just didn't ring true in a number of important ways.The Southern Reach has already sent a number of groups over 3 years into The Shimmer with Lena's husband Kane being the sole survivor of any of the expeditions. Why should this one be any different? Did they actually train as a group? Thorensen for example seemed really surprised that Lena could use an automatic weapon. Surely the character of Dr. Ventress, the group leader, needed more exposition. I don't blame Jennifer Jason Leigh for her portrayal, but Ventress appeared to be the most unlikely expedition leader one would ever come across and significantly didn't appear to give a hoot about the welfare of the other expedition members. More than once she appeared happy to just rock off by herself without caring whether the others followed or not. Supposed suicide mission or not, it was just bizarre behaviour from the OIC.Then after the group has managed to kill a giant, hybrid crocodile, why would they then immediately jump into tiny tinny canoes and then proceed to paddle through the swamp presumably inhabited by those same crocodiles. It goes without saying that the lack of scientific process displayed was very obvious, from the non-use of any protective clothing including the basics like gloves, to none of the group members, apart from Lena doing anything much scientific at all. Thorensen the medical expert, when confronted with an extremely challenging medical related video, crazily comments that the images were caused by a trick of the light.I could handle the regular flashbacks but was bemused by Lena initially saying she couldn't remember anything and then suddenly blurting out all these details which make up much of the movie's content. Perhaps the reason was she was the only 'original' human to return from The Shimmer. And again I could even accept the unlikely proposition that somehow an exploding phosphorous grenade could shut down The Shimmer. But if that was the case, why didn't the first one, that we see exploding on the video, cause more destruction?Annihilation is certainly different from your typical sci-fi fare It's atmospheric, mysterious and even very exciting at times. For those reasons I do believe it's worth seeing, but I do wish Alex Garland hadn't been quite so slapdash in his script preparation. I believe it showed, to the overall detriment of the film.",7,1,5,15 January 2020
Coach Carter," Rims Out!
","It's a sports movie that presses all the normal sports movie buttons, right through to the emotive climax. Down and out underperforming school basketball team from a poor socio-economic area, is led to salvation (in more ways than one) through the concerted efforts of a charismatic coach, who once attended the same school.Oddly what we don't get in a two and a quarter hour 'biographical' movie called Coach Carter, is to learn much about the man himself ... Ken Carter. We find out he is a passionate advocate for educational achievement and the chances and choices it can offer those with a will to succeed. We discover a few of the strategies he uses to develop the Richmond Oilers from a position as a lowly rung team to one that can challenge for a schools state championship. In achieving his own goals, unsurprisingly we uncover the fact that he doesn't mind treading on administrative, player and parental toes to attain his ambitions.But that's about it. Yes he has a son called Damien who was also a very skilful player and played for the Oilers. He has some sort of retail business in Richmond and he has a loving wife whose name I'm not sure we even learn by the end of the film, she gets such little screen time. He is wonderfully played by the always distinguished Samuel L Jackson, but we find out little of his background, what makes him tick and why he seemingly, so suddenly wants to make a difference with the team and the team's school. His story is sketched so lightly that he just appears to come from nowhere.Instead much of the running time of this long film explores the lives of some of the team's players and (ironically enough) their families. Apparently (based on the end credits) most are real people, but their stories are similar to what we've seen in any number of similar school/sports/urban teenage films where characters strive to overcome a variety of disadvantages and adversities.The film has solid production values and the basketball choreography is first rate. But I was personally disappointed that by film's conclusion, the title character standing on the sidelines, calling all the shots and making all the big moves, was himself not fleshed out much past the cipher stage.",6,0,0,21 November 2018
Law Abiding Citizen," Clear Lines of Demarcation!
","Law Abiding Citizen is one of those films of which the production team is likely to think that it is cleverer than it actually turns out to be. Nevertheless the thing that fascinates me about LAC and like films, is the vast chasm of difference existing between critical and general consumer reaction. Case in point is that at time of writing, it has a Metacritic average of 39%, a Rotten Tomatoes rating of an even worse 26%, whilst an IMDB rating of 7.4 from over a quarter of a million contributors. This is saying that by and large, the critics hated it , whilst the general punters really liked it. In any one's language that's quite a differential. I'm giving it a fence-sitting 6 for the following reasons.It's a well-made film from an experienced director with a cast list that exudes quality. The story undoubtedly raises some very valid questions about the strength of integrity surrounding the ongoing workings of not just the U.S. legal system, but those of Western countries in general. It's almost a daily occurrence reported in various media outlets, that alleged perpetrators of serious crimes are given seemingly sweetheart sentencing deals. Law Abiding Citizen takes a what if approach in playing out a scenario, where the wrong type of person, with the right type of skills and resources, has his revenge on the system that he perceives let down his loved ones.In an almost horrifyingly gripping prologue, Clyde Shelton loses his family in a home invasion. He later feels betrayed by prosecuting attorney Nick Rice's actions in handing the instigating crim a pretty generous deal to secure his accomplice's conviction of murder. This begins a compelling narrative, that does occasionally throw up some genuinely unexpected twists.To my way of thinking it is pretty entertaining while you watch things play out, but does require viewers to accept a number of genuinely contrived story points, that at best have slight degrees of realism and at worst are pretty much absurd. At a movie level this sees us having to accept the revelations that Clyde Shelton has a (ever-reliable in movies) Special Forces background, a lawyer's knowledge of criminal law, a genius ability to invent and adapt tools and resources he requires and the ability to build and resource hide-outs in the most unlikely of places.LAC thus becomes a variation of the vigilante movie in reverse. We wonder which of the ostensible 'good guys' are going to be the next victims and how is it to be achieved.Gerard Butler both produces and plays Shelton, which was originally offered to Jamie Foxx, who requested instead to swap with Butler and play the increasingly frustrated DA. Both actors are very convincing, especially Butler who demonstrates he is adept at highlighting both his goodness and badness in the one character. The hook with this film is that no matter how horrid his actions are, a percentage of the audience will see Shelton as the aggrieved hero and Rice, the villain of the piece.For me, as entertaining as it is and to a degree thought-provoking, ultimately Law Abiding Citizen becomes just too unbelievable to take too seriously at all.",6,2,2,14 April 2019
