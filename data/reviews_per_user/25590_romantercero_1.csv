Resident Evil: Afterlife," I feel compelled to warn others!
","I have never written a movie review before but this movie is sooo bad I felt compelled to take 10 minutes from my weekend to warn others I'm not expecting an Oscar wining movie when I go in to see a zombie flick. The plot is so straight forward a 2 year old could understand it. Wait, I think ONLY a 3 year old could understand it. With its MANY gaping plot holes and ridiculous decisions that the character make the movie seems more like a dimwit mixed guns, slow motion effects and then added '3D' to the title. And this is coming from a guy that likes machete and predator.I'm a fan of zombie movies but being a movie that is based on a zombie game this movie has the characters fighting zombies for a few minutes and the rest of the movie is the main character fighting soldiers dressed in swat uniforms.The movie does not advance the plot in any way. When the last movie ended her new target is the leader of umbrella, when the movie ends she has not managed to kill him and the only difference is that she does not have super human powers but the head of umbrella does.AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. MOST POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN PAID OFF.",Null,12,25,18 September 2010
