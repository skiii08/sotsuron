Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What Else Can I Say About This Force
","George Lucas likes the old school of filmmaking - wide, epic ,long shots of scenes were the action takes place within the barrier of the camera's eye.Not to embellish himself with all the new cutting edge ways of building momentum with the ' camera technique 'as seen in a lot of SciFi/Fan/Hor movies as of late,albeit great ones, he continues to inspire with his vivid,but stationary canvass of gargantuan proportions.With computer graphics these days Lucas and his band of assertive elves can create anything they could muster with their noogans.That aside, the story is fine.... being that this is just the opener of a trilogy and the true embellishment of timeless themes , visual emotions and universal empathy for imagination that these films manage to inspire will inevitably come stronger in the coming chapters.Like poetry he has created a legacy of films that don't have to compare to each other.In a sense all installments of the same vision.He's not even a favorite director, but i respect him none the less.",10,0,0,10 June 1999
The Terminator," Classic Classic Classic
",Oh what one man can do with his toys.....From score to visuals to action & suspense to entertainment!  This one's a monster that would give any B-movie and  economically bloated 'blockbuster' a run for its flesh.,8,1,1,10 June 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," With Extensive Work We've Managed To Improve The Fable
","This One's a seriously moving picture. Don't get me wrong, it's action packed and is full of enough shrapnel to de-bark a forest, but the underlying message and subversive tones of whatever you can find wrong with the future of the world within the story is to impress about more.",10,4,5,10 June 1999
Blade Runner," Clearly One Of The Best
","Ridley Scott's tour de force based on a novella by Philip K. Dick The Best of the sci fi elements are thrown in to the mix+ good actors(Mr. Ford In one of his underrated performances) Outstanding visuals, timeless even today(that 80's made futuristic goth look never runs out of style or effect ,for that matter) Excellent direction - visually provoking yet subtly textured and well paced. One Of My Favorites. To Directors Cut Or Not To Directors Cut? Unicorn Or No Unicorn? No Narration Or Narration? Subversive Thriller Or Phillip Marlowe Voice Over???",10,0,0,10 June 1999
