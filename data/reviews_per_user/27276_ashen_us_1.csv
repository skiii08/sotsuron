Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Dumb, Not funny
","Sophomoric! Not funny! Appeals to 13-15 immature males. Premise of the movie good idea but not developed. Some aspects of the movie had potential to be made into funny sequences but follow through does not happen. The dialogue about the color of Borat's suit & the timed use of the word not was funny & should have been developed to include other idioms. Will enjoy it if you like to watch bodily functions, or are turned on by nude, fat men. Some scenes are too long & may have been funny if used as sight gags.Offensive, crude & just plain dumb. Some movies or plays can offend but also be funny, e.g. The Producers. Movie is a waste of time & money",1,176,353,11 November 2006
