Airlift," India's SCHINDLER'S list
","When I saw the movie, I didn't have much prior expectations from it due to recent track record of Akshay Kumar, but He wronged me this movie is damn awesome. Ranjit khatiyal can easily be now India's best heroic character for this ongoing decade.His transformation from an arrogant Businessman to a Savior reminded me of Oskar Schindler.This movie is truly a masterpiece for Indian Cinema , though it is not historically accurate but the haunting script, engaging screenplay and a stellar performance by Akshay Kumar and Kumud Mishra cover up for it. Coming to the performances as I earlier mentioned Akshay Kumar is the life of the movie, he carries the movie on his shoulder and it was not surprising as we all know he was supposed to do that. Apart from Akshay, Kumud Mishra is the second best thing in the movie, he underplays his character very well. Nimrat Kaur was as usual very good.In one of the scene where he lashes out a man for berating his husband, is simply wonderful. Purab Kohli didn't get much screen time but plays his part well. What the movie misses, is a strong villainous-character although Inaamulhaq offers some menacing dialogs in the film in so called 'Iraqi accent' , he was not convincing enough. Direction by R.K men on was good. Final word 'A must watch' for all Indians.",10,0,1,5 May 2016
