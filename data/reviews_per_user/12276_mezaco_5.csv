The Blair Witch Project," Wonderfully innovative, unique, creepy film
","You know, people really have to look at BWP in perspective. Obviously, this film becomes less creepy and more silly if you watch it over and over again. But you have to give it credit where it's due.Everything about this movie when it first came out was brilliantly executed. The way they cast unknown actors, how they tied it in to a documentary on the Discovery Channel (without ever saying it was just a movie), the way they tied it in to urban legends and websites before the movie was even released, made it seem so 'real'. People really wondered for a while what was real and what wasn't.Yes, this movie doesn't have a monster like Leatherface or Freddy, it's mostly about three losers freaking out while lost in the forest. But it was an astoundingly unique bit of movie-making, almost entirely improvized, the actors were given their own cameras and sent away to film themselves. There was no set, and already any crew! Do we really need chainsaws sawing off pretty girls' heads to make a movie creepy?The film is best from Josh's disapperance to the end, and especially the last 5 minutes are spooky enough to make up for the more boring bits in the middle. I mean who has watched it and not truly wondered what happened in that last 1 minute?Shame on those who gave this film a '0', not to recognize what a unique, creepy, innovative film this was. A $30,000 indie where the actors filmed themselves earns $240 million worldwide and you guys can't recognize it's achievements?Doesn't have be your favorite film, but give credit where it's due.",Null,0,1,28 October 2003
The Beach," Forget the snotty reviews, it's good!
","Well, I feel like a freak of nature but I really like this film. Despite overwhelmingly bad reviews from most, this film just takes me away to another place and I really did enjoy it. Some people just really need to lighten up.This film brought out a deep sense of longing in me about my travels and about that search for the ultimate paradise. I found the young people in the backpacker colony on the Beach to actually very similar in looks and attitude to many young backpackers abroad. I also found the sharp contrasts between the Beach and the town on the mainland to be very well done and very true about young westerners in Thailand.The Beach was different, it was exotic. The film didn't end neatly, and that brings up all sorts of ideas about whether or not such a utopia could exist without human greed destroying it. Tilda Swinton did a superb job as Sal, the colony's leader. And Leo Di Caprio was good too as a cocky young American guy looking for a good time but getting in over his head. By the end of the movie, when he's back in the West looking back at that secret place, it was really sad. The constrasts were such so well done...I liked The Beach a lot, and I'll say it proud!",9,1,3,20 December 2001
The Village," A terrible disappointment from M. Overrated Shyamalan.
","A highly disappointing effort by America's most overrated filmmaker, M. Night Shyamalan.Set in a sombre 19th century village, the dialogue is ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious. (eg: in this town you'd say 'It is with your person that I must converse' instead of 'I need to speak with you' etc.) All the clichés are there in the open, from the village retard to the mysterious blind girl (who incidentally can walk and run faster and straighter than anyone else and always seems to knows who's in the room with her, etc.).Once you get past everyone trudging around the grimy little town speaking their ridiculous, badly scripted lines, you then sit and wait for the scary moments. And you wait. And you wait.Oh, and yes. This being a Shyamalan film, you're guaranteed of two things: 1. Shyamalan will make a cameo appearance. And once again, his acting skills will prove to be utterly horrific. 2. Yes, there will be a twist. At first, I was impressed with the twist. But when it's over, you end up feeling really cheated. Like you were dragged through the mud for nothing.This film aims for a spooky, chilling feel. And it could have been so much more. Strange creatures lurking in a dark, misty forest? That's a scary enough thought, and it could have made for a really spooky film. But with the horrible scriptwriting, the terrible dialogue and ridiculous twist, it ends up as a wasted exercise.",4,0,1,19 February 2005
City of God," A stylish tragedy...shocking but stunning
","(this may contain some spoilers)Some people have compared this film to other, mostly American gangland movies like 'Gangs of New York', etc. But this is no mainstream gang movie; There's no De Niro, No Scorsese. This is a shocking, brutal film where an amateur cast of children and teenagers shoot and kill and where guns are more ubiquitous than toys. City of God, based on real life events, follows a cast of children as they grow up in the Rio slum known as City of God. It centers on the character of Rocket, who emerges as virtually the only cast member who is able to transcend himself out of his existence and make something of himself. Otherwise, there's little attempt to 'Hollywood'-ize the experience of these kids. There's no supporting cast of abusive moms or alcoholic fathers to excuse away these kid's behaviour. That's not the point. (But a scene early in the film where a man kills his wife for cheating on him and then buries her in a hole in their living room works wonders in explaining how these children may get their behaviour and violence from...)The film is filled with haunting images....the most haunting of which involve the youngest children. The infamous scenes of L`il Dice as a child of 10 grinning with an almost ecstatic glee as he opens fire on his enemies shocks to the core. I wish I could say this film is redeeming. The main character Rocket's incapacity to commit violence and his own brave escape from this hell is indeed heart-warming in its own sense...but at the film's end as we watch this cycle of crime passing on to a newer, even younger generation of gangsters, you can't help but walk away feeling rather depressed and cynical. All in all though, as a film, it's a major accomplishment, it's stylish, unique, even funny, and as far from Hollywood as you can get.",9,0,2,20 March 2004
A Walk to Remember," Syrupy, schmaltzy and cliché.....but a great young cast.
","***May contain spoilers*** I'm very curious about those viewers giving this film a 10....and I'm also curious about viewers who genuinely cried during this film.A cynical review would call it a mediocre version of the overdone pretty-girl-dies-a-long-and-sad-death genre like Love Story or Terms of Endearment. The film on one level is absolutely dripping with sentimentality and unrealistically poetic exchanges between the main characters. The cynic in me could not help but roll my eyes at the sheer transparent let's-make-the-audience-cry attempt by the director and screenwriter.However...I won't trash it completely. Shane West and Mandy Moore are wonderful young actors and they shine in their roles. The DVD features a fun commentary by the director, Moore and West as they giggle and reminisce about shooting the film. And the music soundtrack is great.Overall, not bad. If you're a 12-year old in the mood for a good cry or if you're an unfashionable Christian who has felt what it's like to be 'uncool' (ie: like Mandy Moore's character), this film will delight you.",7,0,1,21 January 2005
