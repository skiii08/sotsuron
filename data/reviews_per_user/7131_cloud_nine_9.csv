10 Cloverfield Lane," Keeps You Guessing Until the End
","This is a very well made (and inexpensive) movie for this genre. As you know by now, a young woman wakes up in a bomb shelter and seems to be kept prisoner by John Goodman along with a young man there of his own free will. Is Goodman's character crazy or not? Well, yes. And no. We hear he has a theory on mutant worms from outer space.Things happen to both prove and disprove whatever you expect. This takes up about and hour and twenty minutes of the movie. Once Michelle, the woman, escapes, the plot takes a turn I never expected but enjoyed seeing. This is where the Cloverfield reference comes in.During this final chapter there is a short sequence shot with a shaky hand held camera. Luckily it lasts only a few seconds.As I moved into the lobby, couples were discussing the movie, what this and that meant. The ending was pretty straightforward really, if a bit short.If you like the trailer, you'll enjoy the movie. Great orchestral soundtrack. One final thing: once the credits start, the movie is over. There is no final five second scene following the credits.",8,2,4,11 March 2016
Match Point," Held My Interest Throughout
","This is easily Woody Allen's best film in years.....in spite of (and maybe because of) being his least typically 'Woody Allen' picture. Perhaps filming in London gave him a different perspective. It reminded me of 'Room at the Top', several Hitchcock films and Allen's own 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'. So many movie plots today are formula. You know the entire story after seeing the preview. 'Match Point' kept me guessing until the end. There are so many ways the story could have gone or could have ended. The characters are all believable and intelligentÂ…..some of them clueless but believable. Performances are excellent all around. I hope Woody is over his aversion to the Oscars. He may be receiving another one for this.",10,5,10,21 January 2006
Interstellar," Good But Confusing
","Overall I enjoyed 'Interstellar' but left the theater with major plot holes running through my head. Matthew McConaughey mumbled a bit so I lost a lot of his dialog. The soundtrack made great use of pipe organ music which reminded me of 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' from '2001: A Space Odyssey.' This may have been deliberate. Another feature from '2001' was the confusing, metaphysical ending. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADCooper passes out in some sort of 5th dimension and wakes up in a hospital bed. His daughter, who is now elderly and near death, is responsible for saving humanity. The human race lives in a space wheel (like in 'Elysium') orbiting Saturn. Why not orbiting Earth? And HOW was Cooper's daughter responsible for this? Did these trips through the wormhole really accomplish anything?Maybe other people in the audience caught something I missed or couldn't wrap my brain around. A group of people were discussing the movie in the lobby when I left.In closing, 'Interstellar' is worth your time and money. There really weren't any times when the movie lagged. It starts out at a moderate pace and doesn't let up. Be prepared to pay attention and think.",7,2,11,6 November 2014
The Thing," Narration
",I just saw this film again on TNT and it's the first time I ever heard it with narration.  Someone introduces the characters at the beginning.  The ending I remember is the two surviving characters staring at each other at night wondering if the other is infected.  This ended in daylight with a 'dog' running from the burning camp.  Is this an altered version or am I just remembering this wrong?,Null,0,1,29 June 2003
Knowing," Better Than Average Science Fiction
","This posting is about the ending, so reader beware.The movie makers designed the space ship and aliens after the Biblical visions of Ezekiel. He wrote of four beings shaped like men standing beside 'wheels within wheels'. There are strong allusions to the Bible and Ezekiel in the movie. Also following Noah's flood, God says that the next time the earth is destroyed, it will be by fire.I can't help but compare the final scene of 'Knowing' with the ending of 'Battlestar Galactica'. The survivors are left to start over on an Eden-like planet (though on Galactica it is an early earth). They retain none of their technology but are starting over from zero. Memories of their former life will be handed down and form the basis for new religions or mythology.",8,3,10,21 March 2009
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Plot Simply Doesn't Gel
","Interesting sets, beautifully locations, wooden characters. Too much of the story takes places in trains, a prison and the countryside. I really wish more of the plot had taken place in the hotel. Following a confusing beginning (there is a double flashback), the story took off without any real direction or reason. When the movie ended, many people in the audience applauded. My feeling was 'that's it?' All the ingredients were there but the cake didn't rise.Still, I'm not sorry I saw the movie. It was different and that's always refreshing in a time of cookie-cutter plots.At one point I noticed that the movie was no longer being shown in widescreen but more of a television aspect ratio. Once the movie returned to 1985 or the present, it was widescreen. Weird.",7,39,66,14 March 2014
The Descent," A Chic Flic Men Can Get Into
","I've just returned from seeing this movie and can honestly say that it held me in suspense from beginning to end. I now see that it was released in the UK last year and has an alternate ending that hopefully will be on the American DVD. Some minor criticism: SPOILERS (1) Why was it necessary to kill Sarah's husband and daughter in the beginning? The affair with Sarah's friend was what caused tension underground. (2) The creatures really weren't necessary. The tight spaces, darkness and being trapped in a cave without a way out were frightening enough, especially once the infighting and mistrust took root. (3) Those creatures could not have gone unnoticed even though they hunted at night in a very isolated area. They would have been part of the folklore of early settlers or Indians.Still, I recommend this movie and will watch it again on DVD.",7,2,6,8 August 2006
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Difficult Movie to Figure Out
","On the positive side, the acting is superb. Michael Keaton was never better and Ed Norton also gave a brilliant performance. Oddly, Norton's role ended about 20 minutes before the end of the movie. The difficult part for me was determining what was real and what was in Keaton's demented brain.At least twice before the movie ended, I thought that it was ending: first when Keaton jumped off the building and secondly when he shot himself on stage. But he just kept on going like the Energizer bunny. The ending was ambiguous. He jumped out of the hospital window. He had just shot himself in front of 800 people. Why was he left alone? His daughter comes in and looks down from the window. Not seeing him, she looks up and smiles. Fade to black. So Keaton is really Birdman? I doubt it. Maybe they were stuck for an ending.",7,1,8,15 November 2014
The Deer Hunter," Explores a Different Side of War
","Almost every war movie is about how men act in the heat of battle.  This movie is about the lasting effect of war on men's minds once they are home and supposedly 'safe'.  Most reviewers complain that the wedding scene is far too long.  It's my favorite part of the movie because it shows the social and cultural bonds of the community.  It calls to mind one of the best WWII movies, 'The Best Years of Their Lives' which dealt not with battle but with servicemen coping with a return to civilian life.My problem with the movie is the jump from the wedding to action in Vietnam. Deniro is on his own, wounded in a village.  A chopper drops off his two buddies (just these two men) and takes off.  They apparently haven't seen each other in a while and are quickly captured without a fight or any fire support. There's a huge gap in the action like some scenes were cut out.",Null,0,0,20 March 2004
