The Rock," It will rock you.
","If you have ever had a weakness for action movies this is a gem. If you think action is a waste of time this is not for you.With a trio like Connery, Cage and Harris I knew the acting would be good. And with Jerry Bruckheimer as the producer I knew it would be like taking a ride on a roller coaster. And it was. If you spend your money on a Bruckheimer production it is of no importance who the director is. They are all made from the same formula. And that is not such a bad idea when you look at the guy's track record.And with this track record in mind I have to say that this is one of, if not the, best Bruckheimer production I have ever seen. In total I counted two sequences I could have been without. That is very descent for this kind of movie.It is not an all-round classic. But it is an action classic.",Null,1,1,17 August 1999
Elizabeth," Costume drama or political thriller? I don't know.
",One part of this movie is really good while another part of it is rather boring and uninteresting.It looks like a typical British costume drama and as such it is very beautiful and equally boring. It seems as if the director was afraid to make a movie that might actually be exciting all the way through.During the parts of the movie where focus is on the political situation in Britain during Elizabeth's reign it gains a lot and becomes one of the best historical dramas of the nineties. During these sequences the film gains strength and tells us that political back stabbing is not a modern tool.The film's real gem is Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth. Every time she enters the screen she owns it. Her acting is reason enough to see the film. And she is not the only one. Christopher Eccleston and Geoffrey Rush have supporting roles which bring something to the movie. Eccleston's character is a primary player in the political part of the movie. That is why I like it so much. Because the political battle is what makes this film interesting.,6,0,0,9 June 1999
The Usual Suspects," Suspiciously unusual
","This film is fantastic. Normally an American movie is as foreseeable as an infomercial but this one is nothing like anything else.During the running time I was positive that I had figured out the plot.- at least three times. But I was SO wrong.With a brilliant script from 	 and superb directing by Brian Singer this movie takes us to the edge and back. I will comment on the plot as such, as it would be a shame for future viewers, but I have to say that this is one of the most original movies I have ever seen.As this was the film witch put Kevin Spacey in the big league, with the Oscar winning performance as Verbal Kint, it is not filled with big-name actors. Next to Spacey, Gabriel Byrne is the most notable one. Still, all of the usual suspects perform well as does Chazz Palmateri as agent Kujan.If you have not seen this movie, and I cannot imagine that to be the case, you should rather have done it yesterday than today. It is that good.",Null,0,1,16 August 1999
JFK," The conspiracy of the millennium
","For people with an interest in the assassination of President Kennedy this film is a very good alternative to the far from perfect Warren report. With excellent performances from the entire cast, this movie combines the thoughts and theories of Jim Garrison and those presented in Jim Marrs' book.Still this is basically Oliver Stone's own ideas as to what happened that day in Dallas and in the period leading up to it. Most people know Stone for his passion for the Vietnam War and even in this film we get a sub plot about this subject. But above all, this is a movie about a lost innocence. The political innocence and a hope for a better future both on political and racial issues. It's the story of a country with big problems and a refusal to deal with these.One could argue that the JFK we are presented to is far to perfect considering the knowledge we have today. But he shall not be seen as a person but as the personification of new dreams for America. In this light the assassination was a terrible thing and as I see it that is what this film is all about. And of cause one man's quest for the truth. Jim Garrison, who is brilliantly portrayed by Costner. And it is a nice touch to have Garrison himself appear as Earl Warren.The film is a must for everyone fascinated by the myth known as JFK and for those who like movies with a message.",10,3,15,4 June 1999
The Untouchables," Great stuff
","An absolute classic. These three words describe this masterpiece. De Palma and his supreme cast give us what we want. An intense drama about good and bad. A towering performance by Connery as an Irish-American cop with a Scottish accent stand out but Costner, De Niro and the rest of the cast, down to the baby in the Potemkin inspired scene at the train station, deliver great performances. Another reason for loving this movie is, that it is full of really bad editing mistakes. The best one being the roof top scene, where Ness helps Niiti to his car. If you haven't seen it I feel sorry for you. Whether you rent it, or buy doesn't matter. But it is a MUST SEE!",10,58,105,29 March 1999
The Lion King," Disney delight
","Now that's what I call entertainment. Disney has outdone themselves once more. Following great films like The Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, they pull a stunt like this. A very likable story and some great comical reliefs, like Timon, Pumba and Zazu. It's a fable of the old sort, where diferent generations can see it on diferent levels. I've seen both the original American version and in the Danish dubbed version and they both entertained me. I can really recommend it to all ages.",9,0,0,12 April 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," A Masterpiece A Masterpiece
","This is a rare kind of movie. A movie about the development of a friendship under the hardest conditions.Being a huge fan of Stephen King's original novella, and considering past attempts to make his stories into movies, I was very sceptical when entering the theatre. But I have never seen an adaptation of his work which moved me in the way this one did. Director Darabont even get away with turning Red into an African American. Actually I think the movie is superior to the written version.The main reason for this movie's strength is the two leading characters, brilliantly brought to life by Tim Robbins, (should have been Academy Award winner) Morgan Freeman. Together with the director they make this into a universal story and the American movie of the decade.The only drawback is the ending. In my opinion it should have ended with Red getting on the bus. In that way each of us could create the ending we preferred. Most of us would have chosen the same one as the director but as it is presented I think it is a bit over the top. And that is sad for a movie of this kind.Still, if I had to go to a deserted island bringing only one American movie from the nineties this would be it.",10,0,0,9 June 1999
The Matrix," It's out of this world
","With this movie the Wachowski brothers pushed me over the edge of my imagination. During the nineties many films have been called a revolution within the industry but The Matrix is just that.Our hero Neo is perfectly played by Keanu Reeves in, what I consider to be his best performance till this day. And Laurence Fishburne is just as excellent as Morpheus.The visual effects are awesome without removing focus from a very good plot. And a good plot is a rarity in effect films like this one.I surely hope a sequel is on the way. Primarily because it is obvious because of the way the film ends but also because I want more of this.It's great.",10,2,4,18 August 1999
Heat," Masters go one on one
","Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. I could have ended this comment right here. If any actors have been a guaranty for quality during my career as a moviegoer these are the ones. And I think it is safe to assume that I was not the only one who had been looking forward to seeing then in the same movie again.On top of that, they are brought together by Mr. Miami Vice  Michael Mann. Some people will argue that he is not an A-list director, and they are right. But if you can create a success with Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, there should be no limit to what you could do with the acting material available in this movie.The strength of this very good crime story is that Michael Mann gives us time to get to know the main characters. Therefore I felt like I had been watching two separate movies at one time. One of them starring Pacino and the other one starring De Niro. And that is this movie's strength.
The most powerful scene is the one in the coffee shop where the leading characters meet for the first time eye to eye. The only other time we see them together is in the all too obvious final scene. And in container area (if that is Pacino on the ground). Even though Pacino and De Niro are the big-names on the acting side, there are several good performances in supporting roles. Of course big parts like Val Kilmer's and Tom Sisemore's draw some attention I really like Jon Voight  even though it is a very small part.This is by all means a powerful crime movie and I can warmly recommend it to everyone especially fans of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro  if they haven't already seen it.",Null,0,0,16 August 1999
