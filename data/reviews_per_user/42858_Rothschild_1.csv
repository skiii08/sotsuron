The Ring," The Dawn Of Art House Horror
","'The Ring' is a modern day avant garde thriller that plays on subconscious and psychological levels of the audience. One should not view the film literally or otherwise sacrifice its shock value. Many parallel imagery is made throughout the movie that gives it a certain look and feel. Keep in mind that it's a remake of a Japanese film and no comparisons should be made to 'Sixth Sense', 'Feardotcom' or any contemporary thrillers.",Null,0,0,27 October 2002
