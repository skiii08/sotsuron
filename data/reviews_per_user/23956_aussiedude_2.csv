Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Side-splitting!
","This is the funniest movie I have seen in years, perhaps the last 10 years! This is a movie that you will need to see more than once, if like me you laugh so hard you miss some dialog. The scene in the hotel where Borat and his producer get into a fight made me laugh so hard that I could barely draw a breath.Aside from the anti-semitic them that runs through the entire movie the are a number of very confronting moments highlighting racism and prejudice that is so often hidden.This movie is a must-see!",10,4,17,4 November 2006
August Rush," Nice premise but...
","I saw this last night with my wife, we had free passes to a preview screening. I had no idea what this movie was about prior to seeing the movie so I had no preconceived ideas about the film. I thought the premise of the story was a good one; A boy given up for adoption attempts to find his birth parents, because his love for music gives him the sense that his parents are still alive. The problem is the execution lacked believability, his miraculous ability to write sheet music despite having never seen it before for example. On the other hand his unusual method of playing guitar was more believable of someone who had natural musical talent but did not understand fully how the instrument was played. The whole movie was like this, it did manage to make me shed a tear or 2 at the end however.",6,6,14,15 November 2007
