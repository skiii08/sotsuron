Lucky Number Slevin," This film is worth seeing....
","Having read the main review of this film on the site, it becomes apparent that the person who wrote the review had no clue whatsoever what it was on about.OK, yes, it is obvious we are going to get some twists, and i had worked out the major twist fairly early on into the film, HOWEVER, this film still kept me grossly entertained for the entire length, and i felt like i had just sat down to watch it when it ended (NOT that its a short film, its almost 2 hours long).That said, it is worth going to see this film if you like anything to do with gangsters, thrillers, mysteries, crime, mob movies, hit-man movies, anything along those lines...The acting was superb, even my mother has seen this film and she detests violence (which there is a good amount of, although its not overly gory, which is a plus, think Scarface style, you know whats happening but you don't actually see it!) and she thought that it was brilliant.OK, so, all the above mentioned, just go and see it.You wont be disappointed, unless your one of those critics who rips apart every aspect of the film so that the enjoyment is sucked out of it, yet you give a film like Harry Potter good ratings??!?!?!?!",9,12,30,28 February 2006
