The Avengers," Witty and super
","As the first crossover MCU film you would hope it would be good. It effectively combines multiple characters from previous films into a witty action filled adventure. Amazing scenes are littered throughout the movie and it makes for an attention keeping story. The plot is easy to follow but doesn't really need to be considering this movie is not a story driven movie. It takes characters you remember, puts them in a setting you know, faces them against a villain you remember and forces them to work together in a totally epic and occasionally hilarious manner. It also contains a very heartwarming message, not to mention really cementing the MCU as a force not to be reckoned with.",9,1,1,27 April 2019
Howl's Moving Castle," Magical!
","This movie is gorgeous, even for a Ghibli film. The characters are awesome the mysterious nature of Howl works throughout the movie and Calcifer is super entertaining. The plot is complex but not at all difficult to follow. The world built is the best world built in a Ghibli movie and it may have something to do with the moments when characters are not advancing the plot and just interacting in the world. There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie. Lastly the name is fitting to the movie, I love how much of a role the castle itself plays in the film. It always seems to be interesting in every scene and frequently reveal something new about itself.",10,1,2,27 April 2019
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Part two
","As a sequel, it feels as if the first film was just increased in length. There are many callbacks to the original and it wastes no time introducing characters, relying on the audience having seen the first. Like in the title, games are referenced repeatedly which is nice writing. Without Rachel McAdams the movie loses a lot of its charm previously but the addition of Moriarty as a great villain and match for Sherlock makes up for it. I really do not have anything extra to say about this movie that I didn't say about the original. However, Downey's costume department really steps up their game here (in a mostly comedic and funny way). Definitely refrain from seeing the sequel if one hasn't seen the original considering this movie could be seen as less of a sequel and more of a part-two.",9,1,2,7 May 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Not as bad as people make it out to be
","The Incredible Hulk while not being a very MCU friendly movie is still a superhero movie. The plot makes sense. It follows Bruce Banner and his struggles with the US military, simple. Although he is later replaced, for the character written in this film Edward Norton is a great choice of actor. The CGI is okay but the way the Hulk is portrayed amidst the CGI is very dramatic. The movie gives the audience very little background on the character and how he arrived at the point he is starting the film. As a concise stand alone superhero film, it really is not too bad, the downside is it is lacking that special something to make it great, it really is quite bland.",7,1,1,27 April 2019
Iron Man 3," The mechanic
","Iron Man 3 is the first Iron Man movie in which we get to see Tony Stark as a superhero in himself not just a man in a suit. The struggle that Tony experiences around his loss of the suit throughout most of the movie provide evidence of the actual hero being Tony and not the suit. The plot is okay but it overall isn't even addressed too often because the writing is meant to make way for the development of Tony during his final solo film. The villain is good at creating scenarios for Tony to prove himself however he is pretty surface level. I will reiterate once more that although the movie as a movie for the most part is not too great, the scenes when Tony is stuck without his suit provide more character development in a meaningful way than any other scene in any Marvel film.",8,1,1,28 April 2019
Casablanca," Well-made classical film
","I would say this is definitely a classic by all definitions but I also do not think it is a masterpiece by any means. I feel as if those who would call this movie 'the best' are more likely older and have respect for writing, lighting, acting, story but that's it. The black and white is limiting but is utilized well to create stark contrast. Sam is such a fun character and Rick is one of the most subtly complex characters in any movie. It is an incredibly well made film but is definitely filled with a lot of dead-space and moves slowly at times.",8,2,4,2 June 2019
John Wick," Keanu's showcase of talent
","As the only Keanu Reeves movie that I've ever seen, I'm glad it was as good as this one. When it comes to action movies, many fall flat (the exceptions being Kingsman and James Bond). The one man vs. the world is a great plot and is executed wonderfully. The backstory of John is mysterious and is revealed throughout the film. He's a wonderful retired guy and it is super entertaining to see his relationship with others. The antagonists are more like drones run by a leader as opposed to people. A great part of this movie is the cinematography, especially how it works in tandem with the choreography of the fight scenes. Even outside of these amazing fight scenes, the cinematography does not falter and is complemented by the beautiful lighting used in the slower dramatic scenes. Look out for the subtitles too, they are sharp and dynamic.",9,1,1,19 May 2019
Kung Fu Panda," Classic dreamworks
",Kung Fu Panda is one of the animated films that defined the late 2000s outside of the Disney supergiant. It has an artistically creative opening that has a style that continues in later scenes. Jack Black is the supreme choice to play a fat panda and he does it. As a character Po is a great one track panda that brings humor to the table through his personality and through physical gags. The lesson of the film is kind of shoved in your face by the end and the characters definitely have very obvious character development. This plays to the target audience though so it is alright. The reason this movie is so great is purely because it is one of the most well-made and pure in nature animated films.,9,0,0,20 June 2019
The Maze Runner," Hunger Games?
","The Maze Runner is one of many young adult novel movie adaptations that plan the series before movie one. As far as these types of movies go however, this one is one of the better. The good part of the film is the time spent within the maze, luckily this is most of the film so it is totally watchable. While having character, the main group is very one dimensional and throughout there is never a moment when they are force to make a particularly hard moral decision. The beginning is the best part because the small society manufactured within the maze is interesting to learn about, however the rest of the film involving the outside world is very cookie-cutter.",4,0,1,28 April 2019
Iron Man 2," Tony Pt. 2
","Iron Man 2 is the sequel of a great film, that is a lot to live up to. This movie provides a lot of much needed character development to Rhodey as well as the introduction of Natalie Rushman. This movie provides Tony Stark with his first real taste of drama between him and the authorities who wish to utilize his technology without him. The two part villain gives the antagonist aspects of the film more depth and creativity. This film also finally marks a good relationship between Pepper and Tony which gives Robert Downey Jr.'s character some needed humanity.",8,1,1,27 April 2019
The Notebook," Ryan Gosling's second best
","The Notebook to me is the second best romance film of all time beaten out only by Ryan Gosling's 2016 masterpiece La La Land. The Notebook is sweet, romantic, and is a story within a story. The external plot of Duke in the nursing home is sweet and it allows you to sympathize with older couples as well as people who suffer from dementia. The beginning of the story is nice and Ryan does a beautiful job bringing emotion to Noah. Rachel McAdams also pulls off a convincing Allie that goes through a lot of character development. Noah spends the whole movie infatuated with Allie and it works. Allie however has the more interesting arc as her character starts as a prim rich girl who moves into a radical, fun loving, passionate, risky girl for the time period. She then is forced to go back to her roots only to end up back in his arms. The whole movie is filled to the brink with iconic and beautiful scenes that are constructed specifically to make your heart melt. Its ups are high and its lows are way down low but I think that that just adds to the experience.",10,1,2,27 April 2019
The Mummy," Classic adventure
","The Mummy is a classic that does not get the respect it deserves. It is the epicenter of the adventure drama comparable to that of Indiana Jones. Brendan Fraser in his prime is a dream and as much as I'd like to say that this is a 'find the treasure get the girl' film, our lead actress is so independent in her drive. Jonathan is fun, there is a lot of friendly banter and the plot revolving around the mummy is well done. The temple is like Indiana Jones with just the right amount of fantasy vs. ancient Egypt. I is pretty surface level but a classic nonetheless. Gotta see it.",8,3,3,2 June 2019
About Time," Time travel outside of a sci-fi environment.
","About time is exactly the role I'd expect Rachel McAdams to take up. The plot is interesting, it allows for funny, interesting, and complex situations. The setting is nice and very casual. The cinematography is very artsy and it fits well with the acting and general pacing of the film. I would call About Time a sweet romance. The concept of time travel in a romance seems at a glance as if it would diminish the intimacy and humor of such a beautiful genre of movies. Time Travel in this situation is used to create a romance like other romances but it doesn't feel like 'just another rom-com' it feels new. The concept is also simple and easy for anyone to grasp with ease. The only movie I've seen Bill Nighy really fit in.",7,2,2,7 May 2019
500 Days of Summer," Artistic & featuring JGL
","I love this film. I love romances but as the narrator says, this is not a romance. Speaking of the narrator, he is great. It isn't intrusive to the plot and he is entertaining. The soundtrack and song choice is great and fits the theme perfectly. The basic concept is awesome, the idea of the movie being based on days of 'Summer' provides a great sense of time and pacing for the plot. Artistically it is great as well, intermittent parts where the movie shifts genres and a comparison of fantasy to reality looks and feels awesome, the greeting card esc backgrounds are nice too. The cast, Summer is well done and she plays her role to a tee, Tom's sister is fun, and adds some humor and personality to Tom. Through all of this the absolute star of this film is the one and only Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He doesn't have many lead roles and here is where he is given the chance to show off his prowess and his ability to show what feels like real emotion. Terrific ending, I am blown away by a rom-com-tragedy.",10,0,1,19 May 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," IM LAUGHING
","This movie doesn't feel like a Thor movie. When I think about Ragnarok, it feels to me more like an experience of a sort. The movie does what Iron Man 3 does for Tony but this time for Thor, that is he must learn to be an epic hero without relying on his weapon. It provides a nice explanation of Banners whereabouts while setting up Infinity War. I want to say more about the production of the movie but it really is just a standard Marvel film. The reason it is one of the better films is because it is SO FUNNY. This movie could easily be labeled as a comedy because it is filled to the brink with jokes. Usually this many jokes would make the audience cringe, here however thanks in part to the hilarious supporting cast, EVERY joke lands. Korg, Loki, Doctor Strange, and The Grandmaster all have time to flex their comedic muscles one last time.",9,1,5,29 April 2019
Ready Player One," A novel visualized
","This movie is a good version of the story from the original novel. It is not a perfect replication of the book by any means, but, it does work well as a film for those who do not deeply care about the book. The main character is likable and the movie features a supporting cast that actively helps our hero to progress. Ben Mendelsohn plays the villain and as seen in other films he is quite capable of doing so. The visual effects are fun and the world building is very well done, the plot itself is nothing special but just the visual world building mixed with references makes this movie as enjoyable as it is.",9,1,3,27 April 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Young aunt May?
","Homecoming is the newest reimagining of Spider-Man we've had (this time with a younger aunt May). It paints spider man as a still young and naive kid thanks to Tom Holland's performance and uses that for a basis of growth. The movie spends little to no time at all introducing Peter, as Marvel assumes that after five movies you already know the character. Peter learns to find the balance between getting help from others and doing things alone. Also like Tony Stark does in Iron Man 3, who is his mentor by the way, he learns how to be a hero without the suit. The love interest, Liz, serves little purpose but Ned is incredibly funny as a sidekick. Overall just a fun version of Spider-Man.",8,1,2,29 April 2019
Final Destination 2," Good sequel to the original
",This movie is a good follow up to the original. It introduces new mechanics in regards to death. The movie has a beginning that feels like a horror but again is not a horror film. The use of a character from the previous movie creates interesting scenarios but seems like it may have been the creators taking an idea from Saw II. Still not as much gore as I'd think but a little more than the original. The characters are more cooperative but their backstories are not as interconnected to one another (except they kind of are).,6,0,0,19 May 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Cap pt. 2
","This movie accomplishes exactly what Iron Man 3 does but for Steve Rogers instead. Unlike Thor in Thor: The Dark World, this movie is filled with Steve's character development. Not only does he find his long lost best friend but he also struggles in coming to terms with himself and attempting to fit into a new society. He also must learn to trust certain people but not everyone, this only furthers the bond between Natasha and Steve. This is also his second run in with disobeying large authority figures and going against them for not only himself, but also the good of the people.",9,1,4,28 April 2019
Doctor Strange," Wong like Adele
","Doctor Strange out of all MCU films is the most non-MCU film. It stands alone as an interesting movie with magic while also contributing to the universe. Benedict Cumberbatch was a great choice. He portrays Doctor Strange as calm and intelligent (like a surgeon) while also arrogant and self-absorbed. The development of Strange's character is one that is classic but well done, moving from a Tony Stark narcissist to a just protector of Earth. Rachel McAdams helps to balance the plot between the mystical and real. The whole movie constructs a really interesting conflicting narrative between science and belief, and how people can learn to have both. The villain is surface deep until the end when it changes trajectory. One of the best comic relief characters ever. Pretty good as a stand alone film.",8,1,1,29 April 2019
Interstellar," A spiritual successor to 2001
","Interstellar is in my opinion Matthew McConaughey's best film. This movie serves as a spiritual successor to 2001: A Space Odyssey. It takes the audience on a journey through space implementing real science into the mix. The emotional struggle between Murph and a father that she doesn't see most of her life is so incredibly touching and well done. I cried 3 times at different points purely because of the emotions felt by Cooper and Murph. Stunning visuals, amazing concept, and an ending that is complex enough that half of the audience doesn't really understand. I love that",9,0,1,27 April 2019
Ant-Man," This hero is a dad
","'Imagine a soldier the size of an insect, an ant... man.' For as cheesy of a line it is, it fits well in the world or Ant-Man. The villain of this movie is nice. He isn't very complex but he is shown as the villain from the very start and isn't super important. He does look cool though. The family aspect of the film is great, especially because both Hank and Scott spend the film dealing with father-daughter relations. Scott Lang is one of the most regular avengers along with hawkeye, his character is relatable to most and he is fun and casual, something that was missing in the MCU outside of Peter Quill. The concept of shrinking tech allows for very fun and well choreographed fight sequences. It is also funny, the whole movie has a sizable amount of Marvel charm and that that is only emphasized by Michael PeÃ±a's hilarious personality.",8,0,0,28 April 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Great origin story
","Captain America: The First Avenger tells the story of the origins of a character that will run a great series of movies. The origins of Captain Rogers are well thought out and make for an interesting first act. Although you need to look past the weird voice/body conflict of Chris Evans (who does become a handsome buff man immediately after). The Red Skull is a worthy adversary of Captain America and is exactly the type of villain you would expect for the time period. Peggy is a very likable supporting actress till the end and along with Bucky together give Steve humanity and make him more than just a soldier for America but also for himself and his friends as well. This also seems like one of the best integrated MCU films because of Dominic Cooper's portrayal of a young Howard Stark, the father of the fan favorite Tony Stark.",9,1,1,27 April 2019
Nightcrawler," Dark not spooky
","Nightcrawler is a great movie about a sociopath even if it is not advertised that way. One of the best parts about the movie is the stunning performance and physical appearance/transformation of Jake Gyllenhaal. Lou is a character that much of the time makes you feel very uncomfortable thanks to the way he speaks and the way he is written. The plot always feels like it is progressing. There is a great feeling that you get of Lou's antics becoming more and more extreme. The film lacks humor and I think it plays to the style of Lou himself, a person that barely seems to know what humor is. The downside of this movie is too me it seems very plain. The point is to see how others interact with Lou as someone who very calmly and professionally responds. Lou does not evolve as a character only evolve in business, professionalism, and in relationships with others. Overall very interesting film with a dark tone that works well for the subject matter, but as a movie it seems that the 2 hour runtime plays against it seemingly wearing out the audience by the end.",8,1,2,8 May 2019
Bird Box," Bird Box
","The Netflix original is better left as a meme. The movie is slow and all the humor is default Netflix. I never once became attached to any character and throughout the film and when I lost them it had zero impact. The concept of a monster that you can't see is interesting but silly. The trailer is full of moments from the first 5 minutes, all of which are the best parts of the film. If you want a movie that is like this one but better then watch The Mist.",1,8,13,27 April 2019
Footloose," Classic dancing man
","This is an absolute classic. The plot is a wonderful struggle of someone who doesn't fit in meeting other people that don't necessarily fit in and attempting to make a difference in the world. Great characters and a great story make this great and all but you remember it for one reason: The Music. Footloose is not by any means a musical, but you could almost consider it one. The plot itself revolves around music and with it comes one of the best soundtracks of all time. The music is so well integrated with the plot and every scene is enhanced by it. Kevin Bacon is awesome, perfect mix of drama and fun.",8,7,7,5 May 2019
Kung Fu Panda 2," Panda vs. machine?
","This is one of those sequels that doesn't continue a story but still manages to be successful. Kung Fu Panda has a plot that is so concise and well made that you cannot continue the story. You can however create a new story within the universe and do so with wonderful development of characters you already know and create one centered around the concept of man vs machine. The cast and writing is just as good as the original but it still feels like a sequel. This franchise could have been a solo film and I think that it should have. However, after seeing the first one, the sequel is luckily an animated film worthy of attention.",8,1,1,20 June 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Modern, unique, and 'incredible'
","This is by far the best Spider-Man movie of all of them. The art style is so incredibly unique in how it utilizes aspects from comic books. Not only that but the entire film is dotted in most scenes or textured in other ways akin to the tv show Chowder. The next thing you notice in this movie is the sound, more specifically, the music. The music is amazing and perfectly fits every scene throughout. Not only that but the fact that so much of the music is Post Malone fits perfectly with Miles Morales' life and character within the film. It also creates a very modern feeling that other movies lack. The level of absurdity is great and totally works with the animation and plot. This even allows for some great humor moments. Even throughout the absurdity and fast-paced animation style, the movie still manages to hold onto a meaningful and well thought out spiderman origin story with amazing characters that are incredibly well developed. Even the villain has a good motive with an extreme plan fueled by emotion, a good trope in any movie really. Lastly I will address the thing that most people talk about, a black Spider-Man. I will say that unlike other movies, this movie does diversity right. Miles' culture and heritage does play a role in the movie and is clearly visible to the audience, however, nothing about the plot revolves around his race and culture. He's not 'black Spider-Man' but he is Miles Morales, a character that proves to the world that anyone can be a hero with enough determination.",10,0,1,20 June 2019
Now You See Me," A *magical* experience
","This is Jesse Eisenberg's perfect role, a snarky control freak who can do magic to prove he's better than others. The idea of a mix of personalities coming together to form a team is nothing new but it definitely works here considering the different skills that each character possesses. Morgan Freeman plays a good character and Mark Ruffalo plays a terrific bumbling antagonist. But the best part of the movie is that it is basically a magic show but in higher quality and much more exciting. In many ways it reminds me of Ocean's 11, not just in heists but in the characters that pull the m off.",7,1,2,28 April 2019
Captain America: Civil War," The biggest threat is yourself
","This movie is everything that Marvel should be. Let's start with the villain: Zemo. Phenomenal, he has a motive that makes sense, he is creative, uses his intelligence to fight the Avengers and not his strength, and is shown to us not through conflict but through small snippets of his plan throughout the film. The red herring plan is great and allows for the perfect conflict. Breaking the Avengers apart is the perfect concept for Marvel, it creates tension between characters that will have to be overcome in the future. We learn about Bucky, learn about Tony's past, and we get a massive insight into Steve's morals. Steve has already been seen doing what's right and just even if it disobeys direct orders, but this time he does it not against the government, but against his best friends as well. This movie also provides an introduction to multiple characters that were previously either not yet seen in the MCU, or had just not yet been introduced to the other characters. Overall it really is the emotion and story and development of Tony, Steve, and Bucky that drive this film to be as good as it is.",10,0,1,28 April 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Eddie Redmayne in his element
","Fantastic Beasts is a fun start to a series set in a world we love. The film however does not rely on the premade world but instead chooses to place us in a new one. Our main character is already well developed and well acted from the start and I would think it would be difficult to develop Newt much further. I am happy to say however that we really get to see Newt's motives regarding not politics but instead the well-being of his animals. Kowalski is funny and an overall pleasant sidekick, especially when it comes to magic. Sadly the bigger plot points involving credence fall flat and Percival is not a very deep villain.",8,0,1,27 April 2019
Spirited Away," Classic
","Spirited Away is an adventure. As Miyazaki's possibly most well known film, it serves as a jumping off point for most fans and does so in the most exciting way. The whole movie has a very colorful art style which perfectly mimics all of the colorful characters that our protagonist interacts with. She is able to build meaningful relationships with people that just want to help her or don't even talk. There are many smaller plots scattered throughout to show our leading lady's struggle and since each of these subplots have their own ups and downs you stay engaged at all times. Overall Spirited Away does what most Miyazaki films do which is transport the audience into a world that seems incredibly fantastic in comparison to our own. You feel real emotion and a lot of the plot holds a deeper meaning (so much so that I don't understand most).",8,0,0,5 May 2019
Tropic Thunder," Not my humor but high quality
","It starts with some SNL style comedy that I don't find quite funny. The cast is most likely the most all-star cast of all time. The movie is filled with insensitive topics and vulgar humor. The central topic of a film production is a great idea. The makeup and costuming is absolutely phenomenal here specifically for Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. While on the topic, this movie gets a lot of hate because of Downey's black face which I feel is not fair considering he is not playing an African American but instead playing a character using black face to play an African American.The movie does have funny moments into the movie and the interactions between these very different characters is entertaining. It is a comedy and in that realm I do respect it because it is funny. However I feel like most of the humor doesn't hit me the way I could see it hitting others.",6,0,4,9 May 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Both new and retro
","As someone who had never read the comics, I'm really happy to say that Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is still a really good film. Right off the bat the obvious visual style of a mix of retro games with real life is super well done. The characters are funny and are great conflicting personalities with Scott. Scott's struggle and awkwardness is quirky and fun. The film is perfectly paced thanks to the total plot of the multiple ex's evenly spacing out big action scenes. The sound effects, music, and visualizations of said music is perfect and overall the plot is just really concise and interesting.",8,0,0,28 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," It's the end
","Avengers: Endgame is the epicenter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie encapsulates everything that we have been waiting for since Iron Man. Because it is in fact a Marvel movie, the base level of quality is of course high. This includes acting, score, visual effects, cinematography, etc. Endgame is comparable to Infinity War except it does more. This movie shows our favorite Avengers at not only their lowest, but also at their highest both emotionally and physically. Hawkeye grows as a character, Rocket grows, Banner grows, Thor GROWS. Captain America gets an incredible amount of growth as a character as well but nowhere near as much as Tony Stark. The movie takes the characters we love so much and gives us a glimpse into what it feels to lose like they did. The plot is witty and engaging all the way through and the shifts in tone make sense and transition smoothly. My two gripes with this film which is very close to a 5/5 are the main antagonist that is fought at the very end of the film and the inclusion of Captain Marvel. In my opinion she is the only piece of this movie that seems out of place. If I were to describe this movie in only one word, that word would be epic.",9,2,7,4 May 2019
Dirty Dancing," Patrick Swayze can have my babies
",This movie truly is a classic. The music as well as dance numbers really do make the movie memorable but isn't all that is offered. Johnny as a character goes through some awesome character progression along with Baby. The movie houses some standard tropes/life lessons such as don't judge people before you know what they've been through. This trope is even more emphasized by Baby's dad. It touches on real topics without changing the feel of the movie. The 'dance how I want' idea was not utilized quite enough. This movie is ICONIC and Patrick Swayze is HOT.,8,0,0,19 May 2019
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia!
","Mamma Mia! is and always will be considered my favorite movie of all time. The setting is magical and transportive while being the perfect housing of the film. The story is heart-warming and I love stories where the focus is not romantic love but familial. I refuse to see the play version, purely because I love the cast so much, I could not see anyone else playing these characters. Finally what is the best part; the music. The tracks by ABBA are obviously beautiful and, as much as people criticize Pierce Brosnan's singing, The songs are all sang wonderfully and the cast clearly put effort in. If you love musicals or are a middle-aged woman, you'll love this movie.",10,1,2,27 April 2019
Batman Begins," Incredible origin story
","This is a gritty Batman. Origin stories are difficult to pull off and I think it is done great. The villain is not a very concrete single body but takes more of the sort of form that a bad guy of a detective show would take. The plan is both convoluted and impactful, it really presents a challenge to our hero. The starting origins are, in my opinion, somewhat overdone and the relationships he builds are meh. I truly think that this movie is the perfect setup for the rest of the Dark Knight series and think that it provides the most concise origin story & superhero plot in one movie.",8,0,0,2 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," INFINITE CHARACTERS
","Infinity War is one of the greatest crossover events in cinema history. It wastes no time and jumps straight into the plot because it expects the audience to already know who the characters are. Thanos is one of the best MCU villains, he is evil. He has a clear goal, that of which he thinks is good, but everyone else thinks the opposite. The minions are expendable and the audience does not get to learn about them before they die. These characters are also all pitted against mirrors of the MCU, matching powers of the villains and heroes is a great touch. The movie, while making a small amount of jokes, hit each one on the head. While the jokes are few, the witty banter between similar characters provide for wonderful interactions and introductions. The fight scenes are epic and the adventure of Thor provides from a good break away from the other two plots. Each plot has a different setting which allows for great contrast in background between blacks, oranges, and greens. Overall good action packed movie.",8,0,0,29 April 2019
The Theory of Everything," Majestic lighting
","This is not only a good movie, but a wonderful story. The story is full of ups and downs throughout Hawking's life and gives an amazing (fairytale like) insight into his younger years. Eddie Redmayne does a wonderful portrayal of Stephen Hawking which never feels off. The relationships built are abundant and impactful. The actors make every relationship feel real and intimate. The deterioration of Hawking was done very well and gradually (I would hope that was how it really was). The best part is definitely the cinematography and especially the lighting. The lighting creates this amazing mood and atmosphere that the characters flow throw. Overall extremely heartwarming.",8,0,0,13 May 2019
Big Hero 6," Disney but japan?
","One of the best modern animated Disney films out there. The setting is phenomenal, it manages to be both futuristic while also staying completely feasible in our own world. It makes a sort of superhero origin story sort of thing but has it feeling like a friendship based Disney adventure instead. The 'loss of parents' hero trick is overplayed but here it is flipped on its side where our hero starts without parents and loses family in the same story. Baymax is a lovable sidekick and each of the side characters manage to leave the spotlight to Hiro while also developing interesting and unique personalities that the audience is able to find some of themselves in. The villain has a good motive and while not amazing is still good enough to hold his own in such a fun movie.",9,1,1,20 June 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," Not my style
","Grave of the Fireflies is a good film. I will say that first. It is a pretty film and incredibly moving. The relationship between a brother and sister during WWII Japan is not only the main focus, but done incredibly well. The concept is very interesting to an American and provides a great perspective on the events of WWII. It has good pacing and each step along the way moves the plot forward. The biggest issue for me however would be that the movie could not hold onto my attention for much of the middle of the film.",6,3,5,27 April 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Dance off to save the galaxy
","Guardians of the Galaxy was one of the most surprising films to come out of Marvel. It follows a band of outlaws/misfits/losers that come from all walks of life and are all forced to work together for a common goal that is for once NOT taking down the government. Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill and he makes the character as handsome, charming, and epic as he always does; while each other team member is played to great comedic effect as well as emotional effect. The cast of characters is so incredibly likable and this may have to do with how they as characters deal with their personal flaws and learn to accept them in themselves and their friends. This is the first MCU movie that shows life throughout the universe on multiple planets, with many species of people, that are all living in a large society. It sets up and explains infinity stones providing a way for the audience to follow the large arc of the MCU. Finally the reason this movie got so much praise and publicity, its amazing soundtrack that is both diegetic and nondiegetic. The concept that the whole soundtrack is a series of songs on Peter's Walkman is interesting and fun, it allows for the soundtrack of the second to be easily set up, and it features all of the best feel good songs from a very nostalgic time period. Final note: The dance off to save the galaxy, enough said.",10,0,0,28 April 2019
The Imitation Game," It looked well-done and it was
","The Imitation Game is a great film. It is set very well with good visuals to depict the time period. The soundtrack is phenomenal, all of the music is great and fits the theme. The way the movie moves in time is smooth and really adds another layer to the story. When watching, I noticed those things but more than those the two things that stood out to me were as follows. The writing, the writing is extremely well done and keeps you engaged and wondering throughout. This writing evel works well in the form of narration which most films tend to stay away from because they fear they will do it poorly (unlike this one). This leads into the other thing being the man himself Benedict Cumberbatch. The cast is good and well acted; Benedict steals the show (as he should). He absolutely accels at playing an anti-social awkward super genius, similar to his role of Sherlock in the hit show 'Sherlock'. However what is different from his role in Sherlock is how he portrays himself here. He has crafted the perfect character here that feels very far off from Benedict himself. Beautiful acting and writing overall (and the cinematography is pretty good too).",8,0,0,5 May 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," More development? Yeah okay
","Age of Ultron is a great sequel to the original Avengers but not quite better than it. It fits very nicely with the other phase two MCU films in that it serves to not only introduce new and complex characters, but to also allow for growth. This movie very clearly teaches the Avengers as a group that they must work together and be honest with each other in order to have the best chance of succeeding. The villain, while not terribly clever, does run with a plan and has morals that make sense. It is always good to have a villain that believes what they are doing is right. The stakes, while not alien level of dangerous, still feel impactful and provide tension. This movie also features maybe the best scene in the MCU when we get to clearly see the cast as friends instead of just heroes.SPOILERS: I find it amazing that this movie manages to introduce us to a new character, turn him to the good side, and then kill him off all in one movie. I would expect the death to feel less impactful because of those reasons, but it definitely isn't.",8,1,2,28 April 2019
Big Fish," The bright side of Tim Burton
","Being so far from Tim Burton's usual style, it exceeds expectations. It is artistically and thematically beautiful. The way each character is portrayed and the environments that they interact with are so nuanced. It merges fantasy great with reality, containing lighting that allows the audience to easily distinguish between the two. The story revolves around love. It focuses on life, then onto love as you'd see in a romance, only to finish with an incredibly touching relationship between father and son. It is hard to explain what makes this movie so great, but you really do feel good watching it. (full of metaphor).",9,1,1,12 May 2019
The Mummy Returns," Mummy but a little worse
","The Mummy 2 delivers on being a Mummy sequel and like most sequels is a little worse. Their son is fine as a driving point but most of the movie is definitely more cheesy. The cgi is pretty cringy but it does have most of the personality of the first, thanks to the characters. So much more epic and overall pretty wacky. Still overall a movie that I would be totally fine with calling a Mummy sequel.",6,0,0,2 June 2019
La La Land," La La awesome
","La La Land is gorgeous. If you like film, see it and realize why it had so many Oscar nominations. First of all the movie has basically two characters, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's characters are the central focus and it works. They both get nearly equal screen time in order to show off their amazing acting. Not only do they show off their acting, but also dancing and singing, all of which is beautifully sung and choreographed. (This especially applies to Ryan who learned to play piano beautifully just for this movie.) The plot is sweet, romantic, and I always love a tragedy. My favorite aspect of the film are the visuals and the pacing. The movie focuses a lot on color and uses that to paint a fantastical image of Hollywood without being to direct. It helps the plot and determines the mood. The pacing is also perfect; the use of seasons to separate periods of Seb and Mia's relationship works and is timed like they could be chapters in a book. It has a plot that could have been a book integrated with cinematography and musical aspects that I have never seen in a film together.",10,4,5,27 April 2019
National Treasure," CLASSIC Cage
",Here we have a classical Nicholas Cage film that will carry into the future. It is the peak of 'follow the clues' type of adventure film. The premise is just obscene enough to create this funny air over the movie and has enough twists and turns that keep the audience engaged. The villain is a very standard villain but it is nice that they nearly mirror our heroes in treasure hunting prowess. It is simple and not necessarily the most impressive but overall I would have to consider it one of the quintessential Nick Cage films.,8,6,6,19 June 2019
Les Misérables," All star cast, great visuals
","Les Mis is the purest film adaptation of a Broadway production I've ever seen. The Movie itself follows the production beat for beat and it is done great. All of the sets are not well made films sets, but are instead meant to represent the play flats. It looks very pleasing and stylistic. The all star cast is something that I've heard criticized, however, they all portray the characters accurately and both Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are more than perfect for their roles. The costuming and makeup are phenomenal and Anne Hathaway 100% deserved the Oscar she got for best supporting actress.",10,2,3,27 April 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," YONDU!
","At first glance this movie may seem to serve as a moderate sequel to the original, however, it actually serves as a great progression in the MCU for the guardians. The whole movie is about family. Quill doesn't trust his father until he does, only to realize that his real family died when he was young and that his new friends are his family. The most development is all around not Quill, but Yondu. Yondu we learn has had good intentions from the moment he picked up Quill but never really knew how to express them. Here he is partnered with Rocket (another character who has driven those close to him away) and they bond over their flaws. By the end of the film
*SPOILER* Yondu is finally accepted by Peter as his real father and he gets one of the best send offs ever in an emotional light show. I cried.",9,1,1,29 April 2019
Thor," The original god
","Thor is a good movie but nothing to great. Our main cast is good and they keep everything interesting throughout the film. It is always a funny thing to see someone from a different world attempt to become accustomed to American society, that is most of the humor found in Thor. But it is not a comedy by any means, the main focus of the film is instead the classic hero's story of redemption. The plot of Thor banished because of his insolence and then learning to love and protect those around him before saving his homeland. It hits all of the beats of a good movie and flows nicely until the end.",8,0,1,27 April 2019
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Sweet and fun
","This movie is a sweet New York romance. It is an adventure akin to Almost Famous and works wonderfully as an hour and a half long good time. Michael Cera is very comfortable playing the socially awkward guy like in Scott Pilgrim so this is pretty standard for him. The supporting cast is also phenomenal and extremely funny at times. I love how there is a semblance of a direction for our characters adventure but as the night goes on, it totally derails and develops into more of a mental journey. Nick and Norah's relationship is dynamic; it has highs and lows, while slowly progressing towards our final result. Finally the soundtrack is wonderful, as expected entirely from a movie that has a focus on music and playlists. It truly is a great movie for what it tries to be, a short and sweet romance between two music loving outcasts out with friends looking for a secret concert amidst the New York nightlife.",9,0,0,16 May 2019
Inception," A modern classic
","Inception could honestly be considered a modern classic. It is a shame that DiCaprio didn't get as much recognition as deserved for this movie because he really did do a fantastic job. The supporting cast is very, very strong as well, this includes Molly which as a character makes the movie even more engaging. The premise is super unique and makes for an extremely interesting and different action movie experience. As a movie, it plays out similar to a heist film but with no actual heist and a much more complex plot.. Thanks to the dreaming concept, there are some points of special effects that are actually done really well and look/fit perfectly. This also applies to the well-timed speed changes, going from regular speed to slow-motion without feeling at all out of place. It is paced well and hits every beat that it tries to hit. Even if you don't particularly like the idea or genre of the film itself, I feel that it is a movie that everyone should see at some point as a representation of well-made film that takes advantage of modern effects without using them overwhelmingly.",9,0,1,15 May 2019
Sherlock Holmes," Downey's second best character
","The well-named Sherlock Holmes is in my opinion comparable to the acclaimed show Sherlock that came a year after release. Here, the formula of the slowing of time to show the thought process of Sherlock is of course well done with explanation. Robert Downey Jr. is obviously a great actor and does a great job at portraying the beloved detective. He seems to really put an emphasis on the crazy side of Sherlock here as opposed to the more chill Benedict Cumberbatch (this may have something to do with the makeup and costuming). The writing and Downey together create a character that blends very well with Rachel McAdams' character and creates an oddly satisfying relationship. I appreciate how Jude Law's Watson is portrayed as his own person and not just as Sherlock's sidekick. The violence seems unnecessary but at least the fast camera during makes for exciting moments. The villain is mediocre and the music is the fun late 1800s tunes that contrast with the more serious low and slow tunes at other points. Overall enjoyable, especially if you like Robert Downey Jr.",9,1,1,7 May 2019
WALL·E," Lovable robots
","WALL-E is the only animated film that can make absolutely fall in love with a pair of inanimate objects that can only communicate through saying their names. The movie up until it goes into space is somehow extremely charming with a setting that is absolutely terrifying when compared to our own possible future. The music is amazing throughout and there are certain scenes that will make you tear up. However the 'bad guy' in the movie is not likeable and has no motive. This movie could possibly have been transformed to a higher state of film had the movie had been a pure adventure/comedy with romantic overtones in which our main character attempts to help communicate with the human population and also rekindle his relationship with a futuristic service droid, I think that the movie would have truly been a masterpiece.",8,0,0,20 June 2019
Arrival," Interesting take on aliens
","Arrival takes a great approach to the alien contact concept. It showcases the flaws of humanity and also the intricacies of linguistics. The cast, while small, works incredibly well together and creates some awesome chemistry. The soundtrack is a crazy orchestral soundtrack that creates a duper dramatic feeling for most scenes. The end of the movie deals with some really complex conceptual sci-fi kind of stuff but instead of treating it like an actual sci-fi it instead takes on this much more serious tone. I feel like the main character deteriorates by the end of the film in comparison to her start as well. Solid but generally not quite compelling enough to draw in the audience.",7,2,3,20 June 2019
Wonder Woman," Wasted Potential
","Wonder Woman, for a superhero movie such a strong female lead was an incredible let down. The supporting cast was one of the best parts of the film; they were unique, interesting, and showed great chemistry with each other. Gal Gadot portrays the character beautifully and her relationship with Steve is very well developed. The character is exactly what you'd expect and she is pitted against a very interesting villain in the form of Dr. Meru. However the final act of the movie for me ruins it. The actions scenes are well choreographed and very well shot, however, the final fight with Ares is stupid and unneeded. Diana learns nothing throughout the movie and by the end is totally vindicated in all of her opinions. I find the last part featuring Ares to be such a poor way to conclude the plot, leaving a sour taste in my mouth.",5,0,6,27 April 2019
Black Panther," Overhyped
","Black Panther was in my opinion overhyped by the media at release. This is in part because of it's nearly all black cast. First, the fight scenes for the throne have great visual effects and a great environment, however, those scenes are so over-exposed and take over the scene in my opinion. Our main character is unfun and he doesn't create any meaningful emotional bonds throughout the film. Not only is the main character not funny, but none of the jokes are; zero of the jokes hit. The movie has a really good pace and works well as a movie, but NOT as a superhero movie. As a hero, the Black Panther is one of the least epic heroes of the whole MCU. Because of his distinct lack of crazy abilities the ending cannot put him in any insane situations. Killmonger is a well-acted villain but has a master plan with very little threat. The distribution of weapons, while dangerous, does not hold the same weight as other superhero movies. Most hero movies have a villain who either threatens the lives of millions/billions immediately, or threatens the hero's family/friends. T'challa has no relationships to exploit and no big powers to stop the end of the world leaving the ending lackluster.",7,0,2,29 April 2019
Iron Man," Robert Downey Jr. in movie form
","Iron Man marks the start of the MCU and it does so with perfection. This movie deserves all the praise it has been given. The movie has great pacing, funny aspects, and exposes the audience to something they had never seen before. The biggest part of the movie is obviously Robert Downey Jr. He is in his absolute element here: He virtually plays himself. The character is written beautifully and exactly how you would expect Tony Stark to be. Without him this movie would be virtually nothing, but with him it becomes a great origin story to a character we will inevitably come to love even more than we do here.",9,0,1,27 April 2019
The Greatest Showman," I love Zac Efron
","The Greatest Showman, while not a critical masterpiece, appeals to the casual musical lover. It provides a nice story that spreads nothing but positivity. Hugh Jackman is a wonderful actor to be put back into the musical scene and I wish that Zac Efron's character would make an appearance earlier in the film because he deserves more time on screen. No parts of the movie are particularly phenomenal, although the cinematography and choreography during many of the musical numbers is quite good. It's an okay musical with an amazing soundtrack, that alone gives this movie as high of a score as I'm giving it.",8,0,1,27 April 2019
Pitch Perfect 3," Pitch eh
","This is a Pitch Perfect movie. It could be seen as the natural progression of the Pitch Perfect franchise but really does nothing special introducing nothing necessarily new or fun. It reuses aspects from the first two films, hits many of the same beats and is pretty forgettable. Oh yeah, and it's a spy movie. (WHY IS IT A SPY FILM) This movie normally would just be a fine sequel to Pitch Perfect 2. But NOPE, IT'S A SPY FILM. There is less than no reason to put any sort of spy aspect into this movie much less dedicate a large portion to it. Nobody cares about the character development of Fat Amy and it takes the film and shoves it down to a one star.",2,1,2,27 April 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Fantastic Mr. Fox
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a masterpiece of cinema. I do not indulge in many Wes Anderson films but this however is an exception. It gives hope to the future of stop-motion and will hold up forever. The cinematography is absolutely phenomenally creative and beautiful throughout as well as the lighting and use of stop-motion elements. Everything is stop motion, from the smoke to the water; you would never notice. It is all of the small details that happen simultaneously that make it feel so real. The cast brings so much emotion to the characters and George Clooney and Meryl Streep do a beautiful job playing a fox that is both civilized and (wait for it) a wild animal.The chapter names as well are a nice reference back to the book.",10,0,1,27 April 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Better than you'd think
","Known across the Marvel fan base as the worst of the MCU films much of the time, it gets too much hate. When it comes to a stand alone Thor sequel, I really could not have expected anything different. This sadly means that it is quite forgettable but even so, it is a Thor movie. Dark World focuses mainly on Thor, and Thor. The supporting cast is there but much less important than anything Thor does to progress the plot (the plot on Earth has no effect on the story). Even though this movie is a progression of the Thor series, it still manages to provide no development of the mentality of Thor, or Loki, or even Odin. This movie seems to me as a good way for Marvel to accomplish things that set up other movies now, The Aether, deaths, etc.",7,1,1,28 April 2019
Final Destination," Great start to the series
",Final Destination is a fine movie for all the criticism it gets. The movie is based around an interesting premise and is executed well. It is fun to see the characters struggle to figure out what is happening and the trope of the characters running from the cops being blamed for murder works well. The deaths are creative as expected but not as gory as one would think. The movie has that B-horror feeling but is definitely not a horror movie. The mysterious man who helps our cast does not get enough screen time.,7,0,0,19 May 2019
Pitch Perfect," Don't watch the third
","The classic Pitch Perfect is also the best Pitch Perfect. The plot revolving around an acapella group is interesting to most and it takes place in a world with an acapella scene that is more well developed than it is in real life. The cast is diverse in personality and work well together, creating moments ranging in humor. Anna Kendrick plays her role great and is incredibly talented. The trope of an outsider coming in and creating change works really well here. Her relationship with Jesse is sweet and it allows for some good redemption later in the film. The fact that there are downs and ups of the film make it overall more impactful, and the writing is high quality.",8,0,0,9 May 2019
Footloose," Faithful but not upgrade
","As far as remakes go, you cannot be much more faithful than this. It takes an absolute classic movie and updates it in all aspects from music to cast. The movie hits all the same beats as the original. So as far as most of the plot it is just as good. The dancing in my opinion is more well choreographed this time but even still there doesn't seem to be that special. I do have to appreciate the fact that they kept in pretty much every iconic quote from the 9184 version. Footloose was already a 4/5 star good movie but this as a remake, while faithful, is not quite as well done (acted among other things) as that original.",6,0,1,6 May 2019
Incredibles 2," Doesn't live up to the hype
","Incredibles 2 is a sequel too late. Of course it will be hard to make a sequel that lives up to the original and they didn't quite overcome that challenge. The movie picks up right where the first left off but it seems as if the previous movie didn't happen. Character growth from the previous film is pretty much not there and the Tony bit throughout the film is awkward. The humor is lost on me, I don't find much of it funny but maybe some do. The graphics, upgraded clearly to stay competitive in today's market, but it differs so far from the original that it feels out of place. I enjoy the twist of seeing Helen doing the work and getting to see Bob bond with his kids while supporting his wife. Edna is just as good and the suit rundown is just like before (which is a good thing). The big problems with this movie come from the new characters, villain, and climax. First the new heroes look very weird; they look inhuman. Winston Deaver is the only charming newly introduced character to me. The villain is not good. Dull, predictable, and trying to fulfill a poorly thought out plan are all ways I'd describe the villain. Finally the climax of the film. Why is there a hydrofoil? There is not reason for there to be a hydrofoil. Overall I have some huge issues with the plot but the action sequences are all great and the humor probably appeals to people that aren't me.",5,2,4,7 May 2019
The Social Network," Jesse Eisenberg is smart
",I love a good biographical movie and this is not too shabby. Jesse Eisenberg does a wonderful portrayal of an anti-social super nerd by the name of Mark Zuckerberg. One thing I will say is that this movie is much more educational than I would expect in regards to the history of Facebook. It is entertaining to see how the characters progress in the movie. It is a pretty standard film that I won't necessarily recommend watching but also definitely not complaining about seeing in the first place. Not too memorable overall.,8,1,1,20 June 2019
The Martian," Do rewatch this
",This movie was a hit in 2015 but many seem to have forgotten about it. This movie should definitely not be forgotten about. It is Matt Damon's best movie in my opinion. The humor brought to us through the writing is hilarious and it is delivered perfectly by people like Matt and Donald Glover. The concept is both sciencey and interesting to your average watcher. It is a compelling story filled with trials to overcome. With an amazing soundtrack this really is a 10/10.,10,1,2,2 June 2019
