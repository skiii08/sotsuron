Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Can that Lucas guy direct or what??
","Two years ago, when I heard that the new Prequel to Star Wars was being made, I thought to myself, 'HHHmmmmm...What an interesting idea.  But there is no way it can be as good as the originals.'  I was an ignorant human being that day.  It took about ten minutes before I was totally hooked and believing that this movie was just as amazing as the original Star Wars was the first time I saw it!  With George Lucas behind the camera you are guaranteed a good show, and he comes through once again on this film.  His characters seem to lose something among all the puppets and digitally created shots, but the story, as well as the acting, is as good as it could be!  The Star Wars theme is just as memorable as before, and you walk out of the theater humming the tune with a smile on your face and the memory of a great movie in your mind!",7,0,0,21 May 1999
Elizabeth," Wish I could have seen it again
","The first time I saw Elizabeth, I was so enraptured with the performance of Cate Blanchett that I couldn't easily tell if the movie was good or not...but the second time I saw it, I said, 'Ah...It is a good film!!' Some of the best parts of the movie come not too far in and are comedic for a short while, as the French Prince comes to England to try to marry Elizabeth.  All of the performances were great in this movie...and, though he didn't get much credit for this or Shakespeare In Love, Joseph Feinnes did a wonderful job.  As did Geoffrey Rush and Sir Richard Attenborough. The costumes were also teriffic...there are scenes where I would just block out the sound and stare at the costumes for minutes...literally staring, at the sets, too.  They were absolutely beautiful.  Shekar Kapur definitely knew what he was doing with this one!!!  I'd also like to say that this movie was not very commercially successful, and people don't know what they were missing...Go out and rent it today!!!!!",8,0,0,5 May 1999
L.A. Confidential," What is wrong with this movie???
","What's wrong with this movie...I'll tell you.  Nothing. I can not find a single thing wrong with this movie.  The acting is incredible for a virtually unknown cast, aside from Spacey and Basinger, and the story is almost perfect!  The writing and directing are almost flawless and the best thing about the movie:  The art direction.  It was so perfect! The whole time I was watching, I actually thought it was 1953.  It absolutely blew my mind. Aside from the violence in some scenes, and some choice words in others, the film is almost for all ages.  And anyone who likes a good mystery would enjoy such an intriguing piece of filmwork!! It is truly masterful and I think that it should have beat Titanic based on the acting alone!!",10,0,0,3 May 1999
Empire Records," Horrible, Horrible, Horrible
","Everyone was talking about this movie, Empire Records...'Empire Records is great, man...you gotta see it!!!'  So I did, and I hated it.  From beginning to end it was like one big suckfest and everyone was invited.  Had it not been for Ethan Embry and Renee Zelwegger, I probably would have turned it off, but I thought that they did great jobs, and I commend them for working so hard on a bad movie. The director also, I much prefer his old work, such as Pump Up The Volume with Christian Slater...That was a real movie, Empire Records is like, Pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-teenage crap...I don't know anyone that is above the age of eleven that acts as immature as they do... There were scenes that I liked, especially the ones with Brendan Sexton III, but other than that, I thought the whole thing was mundane, boring, and stupid...I wish I could recommend it, but I just can't.",1,8,22,4 May 1999
Jerry Maguire," just when I think Tom Cruise is done
","Every time I watch a Tom Cruise movie, I compare it to my favorite one, Rain Man.  Even though he wasn't the main character, I still feel that it is his best acting job.  The closest he has ever come to that is Jerry Maguire. When I sat and watched this movie the first time, I kept thinking to myself, 'This better be much better than 'Days of Thunder' or I'm walking out.' Then within the first five minutes, I was hooked.  Tom Cruise has some kind of magnetic charm over everyone in the world...it's scary.  So that is my favorite aspect of the film, the acting. Next is Cameron Crowe.  I thought that this movie was a little better than his previous work, Say Anything-which I love-and Fast Times At Ridgemont High-which is okay.  The writing seemed to be very similar to Say Anything, with the monologues and the quick dialogue back and forth between characters...and of course the dramatic love scenes. I also loved the child, Jonathan Lipnicki...he was so cute.  He is the kid that should be in every movie, but of course that is impossible. I wish that the movie would have been longer...or lingered more on the relationship between Jerry and Dorothy...I felt that that part of the movie went by way too quickly...but that is just me. Finally, I love the way the movie ends...it is one of those endings that makes you feel why they make movies anymore...besides, I know that I had you all, 'at hello...I had you at hello.'",10,4,12,3 May 1999
Titanic," A Great Movie...If You Like Bad Acting!!!!
","I liked Titanic, don't get me wrong, I thought it was beautiful.  The direction was marvelous, the costumes, the music...everything was great. Except the acting.  I found all of the characters, except Molly Brown(Kathy Bates) and the Billy Zane rich-boy, totally fake.  Leonardo DiCaprio, on one hand, is an excellent actor.  If you watch him in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'-which scored him a nomination for Supporting Actor-you can see his passion for acting...in Titanic, you can see his passion for the paycheck. Another former actor is Kate Winslet, who was nominated for her role as Rose...C'mon, please!!!  I could have played a rich girl better than she did...and I am neither rich nor female.  The fact that she fell in love with the Jack Dawson character not only upset me personally, but it also disturbed me-in a very weird way.  I never expected to not like Jack Dawson...I just liked the Billy Zane character so much, I couldn't stand to see him lose-even if he did deserve it. I think the real problem I have with the movie is that I saw at least three better movies, and didn't think Titanic was anything great.  I was rooting for LA Confidential to take home the Best Picture award...maybe I'm just not sensitive enough to understand the love between the princess and the pauper, but that's just my opinion, I may be wrong.",8,2,3,1 May 1999
