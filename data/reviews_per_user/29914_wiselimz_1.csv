The Perks of Being a Wallflower," It did the novel justice. Watch it, seriously.
","It's been sometimes since movies have done novels justice; and I am grateful this one, is.Last night, I went to watch this movie. 8 months ago, I was browsing through a bookshop and I found this book with a very creative cover: The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Very intrigued by the title of the book, I decided to try my luck and read it.One of the best books I've ever read, I was immediately stoked when I found out Stephen Chbosky himself decided to adapt his own book into a movie! What!!! This to me is pretty unprecedented because it also means that the movie wouldn't be butchered by some stupid director! I was again very excited when I found out so many of my favorite actors are going to star in this movie!Okay, sorry for the irrelevant introduction. Anyway, the whole movie was very amazing, it almost stuck 90% to the plot, with the omission of certain parts of the book's storyline, because of time constraints. During the interval of 120 minutes, I never yawned once!This movie tells on this guy, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who is a socially awkward introvert and how his life progresses as he meets a senior, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his sister, Sam (Emma Watson).1) Charlie (Logan Lerman) - Logan immediately portrays Charlie to near-perfection, as I saw for myself, Charlie coming alive from the book. And Logan just transformed from the charismatic Percy Lightning to this boy who is so awkward around people, it's just unbelievable. He's a great actor, that's for sure. There was this scene towards the end that was so powerful to me because it seemed so surreal; Logan acted exceptionally phenomenal at that part of the movie.2) Sam (Emma Watson) - Hermione is no more Hermione. Emma acted out of that role, she became Sam in this movie. She is as she is from the book, just feisty enough, frivolous, loving, caring and beautiful inside out. I loved how she portrayed Sam, she did not give the character a perfect image, it was like a beautiful painting tainted by forgivable negative traits! One thing for sure though, you wouldn't believe that she's played that smart witch at Harry Potter.3) Patrick (Ezra Miller) - I was excited for this guy because I watched 'Honey, We Have To Talk About Kevin' and he played this sick-minded guy in this respective movie but in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, he transformed completely! I couldn't believe it when I saw how Patrick come to live! Ezra definitely came close to stealing the show. You should just watch the movie for the sake of this guy.4) Kate Walsh, Nina Dobrev - These guys were incredibly good too, they did their roles justice without, however, much screen time. Still, the few minutes given to them were enough as their presence was felt.Overall, I can't tell you how great this movie is. You just have to watch this movie to believe it. Don't worry if you haven't read the book, it's equally good, TRUST ME!!!!!!!!I'm having several catharsis right now, the movie is just too fantastic. Not to mention, the soundtrack makes you wanna believe the movie is real and the characters are out there, somewhere.",9,1,3,13 October 2012
