The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Dawn Part 1
","I just returned from a packed theater with my friend. I saw Breaking Dawn part 1. Before I begin I'll tell you that I am a male teenager who is a die hard Twi-Hard. I am on Team Edward. Okay now I'll start.... Breaking Dawn was an enthralling, beautiful movie that was hugely more serious than the other films. It was even scary at times. The CGI was extremely realistic. You could tell that this was made by a new director and that he really knew what he was doing. Also, against what anyone says, the acting was superb. Bella's wedding nightmare scene was terrific. Also her vampire transformation contained cool shots of crystallizing veins. The birth scene was just graphic enough and Kristen's perfect acting made her look completely dead. Seriously, I've read the book about 7 times and I know that she doesn't die but I was convinced that she was actually dead. The final shot is witty and thought out. The perfect time to end the perfect movie.",10,12,29,18 November 2011
