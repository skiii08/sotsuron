Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," This film definitely does NOT fall for the sequel 'curse'
","Sherlock Holmes lived up to my expectations, clever, funny and action-packed to the rafters. The first one was good enough, and when i learnt that a second was in production i was buzzing to see it. It was one of few films that i felt confident it wouldn't fall into that dreaded sequel 'curse', and when i saw it on Wednesday, it didn't disappoint one little bit! I was hooked from the start and i was that way until the end where Holmes (Robert Downey JR) printed a '?' on Dr Watsons work. This surely means an arrival of a third film? I think Stephen Fry done an excellent job as Mycroft (Holmes' Brother) and as did Jared Harris as prof. Moriarty (Holmes' Arch Enemy).Overall this film is definitely one of my films of the year. 10/10 & *****",10,2,7,23 December 2011
The Hunger Games," This film is excellent, and VERY cleverly done.
","I haven't actually read all of the first book, but I was so enticed in it i'd thought i'd see the film and compare the two. I must say, the film was sensational.The film started as the book started, with Katniss(Jennifer Lawrence) and her sister, Primrose (Willow Shields),in their small house. Both actresses played their parts exceptionally well, especially Jennifer, perfectly casted as Katniss.Throughout the film there was action and enticement on offer. There was also emotion felt, and scenes that kept on the edge of your seat. Best part and arguably the saddest, Rue's death, so emotional and directed perfectly, well done Gary Ross for that one.Overall the whole film is a success, and i hope it grosses so much money. Well, it seems to be doing that anyway as I write this. Excellent.Roll on 2,3 and 4!!! 10/10 5 Stars *****",10,6,15,1 April 2012
Finding Nemo," Clever, Funny, A Stroke Of Genius From Pixar!!
","Finding Nemo is the perfect example of a great, no not great, brilliant animated movie. And the best thing about it is, even if it didn't have the big names of the world of acting in it, it still raked in more success than LOADS of other movies. The reason for this is easily the whole story of it, the clever scripting and the hilarious outcomes.The film follows a clown fish (Marlin) trying to find his son (Nemo) who was taken by humans while at 'school'. Along with Dory (A Fish which surprisingly had the memory of a GOLDFISH) he sets out on the epic trek across the ocean in search of Nemo.Now you may think this movie is quite depressing, and the humour intended wouldn't be funny. But,to be quite honest, it is hilarious. My favourite part has to be the Seagulls. Their constant repetition of 'Mine!' had people laughing right from the start.I rate Finding Nemo 10/10 just because it deserves it and how Pixar have put this whole film together is a stroke of Genius! Very VERY Well Done!!",10,0,2,24 April 2011
The Woman in Black," Excellent, Finally a Proper Scary Movie, but Why Is It Rated a 12?
","No word of a lie, i was scared before i even sat down to see this high anticipated movie. As far as i was concerned i thought that if i hadn't seen the actual play, i wouldn't understand it. This review will be my most thorough to date, reviewing every square inch of this movie.Firstly, CASTING. Before going to view The Woman In Black i took some time to read other peoples reviews in local newspapers, and the thing that really stood out for me as a criticism was the fact that nearly every reviews mentioned Daniel Radcliffe not being right as the main part, saying he was too young to be cast as a long term father. I went to see if these critics were just out there to criticise Radcliffe and i discovered that i felt he done a great job as a major lead role, obviously having enough experience from blockbuster film series Harry Potter. I did see the critics point, but i did think they were a tad harsh. 9/10 Secondly, PLOT: Personally, i thought the plot was clever, yet quite easy to follow. Apparently, according to friends, they had changed the ending. I observed that, yes, the ending was different, but it didn't bring my overall rating of the film down at all. It was still spine-chillingly good. 10/10 Thirdly, SETS/LOCATIONS: Loved them. Thought that the ideas gone into where each scene is set were exquisite. No criticisms. 10/10 Lastly, EXPECTATIONS: I truly expected the best from this film, and the best is what i got. It was a tense, scary and overall brilliant affair. Throughout the movie you could expect at parts something was going to jump out and make us gasp, but i couldn't predict exactly when, and even though i knew it was going to happen, i still jumped in shock. The film exceeded my expectation and was well worth the money i paid. 10/10 5 STARS *****",10,1,4,11 February 2012
