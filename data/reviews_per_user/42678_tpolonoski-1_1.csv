Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Beautiful!
","Quentin Tarantino is at his best,we all wish there was a #3,Kill Bill 2 has the most wonderful music!Tarantino has excellent taste for beautiful Japanese music.My favourite was when the bride is in the coffin and that Brass music plays,Beautiful!Everyone I know loves Uma Thurman!Shes a very good actress in all her movies!I give Kill Bill 2 an excellent 10/10!More if i could! There's so many mysteries hidden in Tarantino's movies I love Kill Bill the most!I haven't seen Reservoir dogs yet but I'm sure Kill Bill is better.I don't get it how people don't like Kill Bill how could you not?Buds Hot :3 Make sure YOU vote for Kill Bill 2 or 1 so it can be #1 MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!",10,2,4,24 March 2006
