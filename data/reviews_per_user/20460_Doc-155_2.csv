Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good film - definitely a must see
","In general the film is lots of fun with just some minor detractions.  The #1 detraction has to be Jar-Jar Binks.  I hated that character and found myself wishing that he would get squished sometime during the film.  The only other detraction is that the purpose of the film seems to set up the events of the following two films while contributing very little to the overall storyline. Besides these relatively minor criticisms, the movie is exciting, engrossing and visually stunning. The lightsaber fight is one of the best 'sword fights' I've seen in any movie.",8,0,0,30 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Amazing movie
",This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long while.  Highly recommended.  Don't expect a generic horror movie...no blood and guts for blood and gut's sake alone.  Very well done with a shocking twist.,10,0,0,7 September 1999
