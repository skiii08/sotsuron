The Lobster," Yet another author's bitter view of the human flaws
","I'm not too familiar with Yorgos Lanthimos' works, and so far i've only seen his Oscar-nominated Kynodontas. But it looks like the author is on the mission of exposing the defects of the modern society in a not-so-cryptic but still an allegorical way. And while i believe that his view of the parental overprotection/abuse of their children was way too exaggerated and dramatic, his view of the awkwardness of today's relationships between people is much more curious and realistic.Freddie Mercury, when he was once asked what Bohemian Rhapsody was about, gave a simple answer: 'It's about human relationships'. The same description probably fits this film if one was after a simple answer. A more detailed description would be inherently subjective, for a film that speaks riddles and metaphors to you is never what it shows but rather what you see, and different people can see different things. What i saw was a rather sad contemplation of how we humans interact with each other, of the pressure the society puts on us when it tries to categorize us or impose its views of normal on us, of the fact that no matter how you run or hide, there alway will be someone who thinks that they know better and that you're obliged to follow their opinion on what's right and wrong.In the modern Western world, where a CEO of a huge corporation can openly admit being homosexual and have no problem with it, such visions could be considered too dire to be relevant. So maybe the works of Lanthimos are a reflection of his personal tragedies or his experience of living in Greece. But there is still a reason to view The Lobster as a warning (or even a revelation) that we all should pay attention to.You see, the best way to expose something crooked or perverse is to simply demonstrate it in action. The Lobster does that by showing the societal pressure and personal defenseless as a norm, to provoke a response in us and make us think something like 'Why the hell aren't you doing anything? Stand up and fight for yourself!'. And it's a powerful tool, for it's often the case that only by feeling discomfort about someone else's compliance and passiveness we finally realize how much we avoid fighting for our own selves.But the scariest thing about The Lobster is that not everything that it shows is that utterly uncommon. But this time it's not the society and its latent dictatorship, but the people themselves. Even alone with their close ones, even when nobody's watching and there are no rules to play by, they still can't relax and be genuinely interested in and kind to one another. And that's not just fiction, it's what i personally see in more and more people these days: social awkwardness and sociopathy, lack of empathy and ability to read the emotions of others, a general coldness and discomfort from another person's presence. Like the parties where people bury themselves in their smartphones instead of actually talking to someone or the families where the partners hardly even speak, each in their own cyberreality. The way such people talk when forced out of their virtual covers, that helpless look of a fish taken out of the water - that's eerily similar to how The Lobster's characters behave sometimes, which creates a sinister picture of what our world of tomorrow might become. And if some of us do manage to see themselves in that distorting mirror then maybe transforming into creatures that live long and mate happily but are otherwise cold and indifferent is a fate humanity might still avoid.",8,6,12,28 March 2016
The Equalizer," Washington vs Russians, 2014 edition
","It's hard to invent anything new in the genre of the action movies. The Equalizer is no exception. This time, we have Denzel Washington as a nice and hard-working employee of a big hardware store, who comes to a nearby diner at nights to read. But when a young Slavic hooker named Alina, who he occasionally talks to, gets into trouble, this old man, 'dedushka' as the Russian mobsters call him, decides to put some people-killing skills he tries so hard to forget about to work.The movies where a small and quiet man is revealed to be some sort of retired John Rambo who gets back to business for the sake of justice are always a guilty pleasure. You can predict almost all the plot turns, and it's not like it turns all that much, but still you end up rooting for the good guy, simply because all of us sometimes wish that such people really existed in this world. The whole idea of a one-man-army doing the impossible so that the weak and exploited of this world could finally have some peace in their lives will never die as long as we live in a society ridden with criminals and ruled by corruption.Too bad that a likable protagonist doesn't automatically make a movie excellent. And that is why the filmmakers use all the tricks up their sleeves to persuade us to turn off the brain and judge by emotions only. Cruel and dumb mobsters, poor young girls who need protection, ruthless boss villains who seem to have no single positive trait about them, and all that is financed with the Russian oil. Awesome sauce.I do admit, with the way my country behaves lately in terms of the international matters, the return of the old-school image of a Russian evil is very well timed. And i personally have nothing against it, after all, we do deserve to be treated as a threat. I just wish it was done in a fresher way. Denzel Washington is without a doubt a great action movie actor, but it looks like he'll hardly top what he did almost a decade ago in Training Day. Now that was really intense, there he really had to break a sweat to get the job done. On the other hand, in The Equalizer things simply happen the way he needs, so this action thriller inevitably loses the thrills it tried to hold. And while the villain guy was moderately believable as a worthy opponent, and the final scene in the hardware store was really impressive, those were probably the only things in which this movie actually tries to stand out.On the other hand, with a little imagination this average action movie may turn into a very dead on political satire. Evil Russians are exploiting and brutalizing a girl with a rather Ukrainian name 'Alina', and a black man with a profile resembling Barack Obama's and a last name 'Washington' that speaks for itself, manages to singlehandedly deal with all the bad guys and tops it with killing the mob kingpin, whose last name starts with 'Pu' and ends with 'in', in his Moscow mansion. Since we all know that the real mobsters prefer London to Moscow, it makes the allusion even clearer. And the fact that the movie was obviously filmed before the recent political turmoil makes it almost prophetic.But even if that interpretation is just a pipe dream, this movie is not that bad. Especially since for an eye candy it has Chloe-Grace Moretz who's obviously trying to do more various roles but still can't help ending up in the same cute, a little clumsy and somewhat childish image. Not that we don't love her for that, do we? ;)The bottom line is: if you want to see a decent action movie where the good guys win and the bad guys die, or if you like to find the hidden meaning where there probably is none - then The Equalizer's your game. But don't expect anything close to Training Day from it, this way you'll save yourself from unnecessarily high expectations and disappointment that usually follows.",6,4,6,13 December 2014
Deepwater Horizon," Too technical, too messy, and arguably too glorified
","Here we go again, Deepwater Horizon is a film that claims to be based on true events. Indeed, there was an oil rig by such name that made a huge mess in the Gulf of Mexico. The question is, how close this film stays true to what really happened there on April 20, 2010.Because if we judge this film by its cinematographic merit only, then it could easily be described with a concise formula: a catastrophe flick, brutal but generic. The typical build-up, with lots of banter, friendly and not so much, and a ton of techie jargon you'll hardly understand even if you could pause every now and then and look up every word. And then the typical climax, when the hell breaks loose and everyone gets their chance to reveal themselves and to be either @ssholes or heroes. And the typical finale, grim but happy, with the survivors hugging their wives and kids and exchanging those meaningful looks. If that was the first disaster movie I had seen, well, I'd probably feel absolutely satisfied. Because the disaster part of Deepwater Horizon, finally devoid of the mumbo jumbo talks and turned into a big quest of survival in a burning hell above water, is definitely gripping enough, thanks to the solid performance of Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell, and the impressive visuals. However, I've seen such films before, both dramatic and ridiculous, so I'm bound to wonder whether Deepwater Horizon is able to bring something new onto the table.Unfortunately, the answer is no. Last year we've seen another catastrophe film based on a real story, Sully. Well, it was not a typical catastrophe indeed, more like a catastrophe turned miracle. Still, it was a demonstration of a different approach to telling the stories of such events. And while Sully was definitely less dynamic and much more political, it was at least original. And that is the quality Deepwater Horizon isn't really able to boast.If only we could only know how much of this film is fiction and how much is based on reality indeed. Because if the filmmakers had shot Deepwater Horizon strictly in accordance with the real events, then all that purely American heroism and even the techie talks would've felt... different. That way we'd actually be able to assess the scale of stupidity and greed of the people who let that disaster happen, and the scale of heroism and sacrifice of those who were doing their best to avert that disaster, and, when the worst finally happened, were risking their lives to save those of their fellow men. That would've been a true feat deserving every praise possible. But I know Hollywood. And, while I'd like to believe that some of the exemplary behavior shown in this movie did take place that day, I'm more inclined to think that Deepwater Horizon is just a rough outline of the true story, and all those inspiring and noble actions done by Wahlberg and Co are there just for the show.",6,3,5,2 March 2017
Kung Fu Panda," A big furry piece of excellence
","An old computer programming proverb says: the best written code doesn't need any comments, for it's self-sufficient. The same can be said about movies: the best of them don't need to be reviewed, for they are perfect without any side comments whatsoever.But since IMDb makes you write at least ten lines of text for them to be passed as a review, here i go. I have first watched Kung Fu Panda back in 2008 and instantly fell in love. And every time i got to re-watch it, i kept falling deeper and deeper in love with it. Wall-E may be topical and artistic, but Kung Fu Panda is like a reflection of Po's soul: deep, kind and sincere. And that's exactly what we love animation for: that it turns us into little kids for a short time and helps us believe that there is good and beauty in this world and it's up to us to create and uphold it.A good animation film just sends you this message, a great one allows you to feel it, a brilliant one can make you truly believe in it. And with Kung Fu Panda's magical touch that reaches for the deepest parts of a human soul, we can all become believers, and not just for 92 minutes.",9,0,0,7 December 2015
Rocketman," Reflections of a rock star
","A person in an angel-demon costume bursts into a room with people waiting for him, crashes on a chair and begins his confession. His name is Elton Hercules John, and his life is a mess.When we talk about biopics, it's very cheesy to use the word 'special' to describe them. Obviously each of such films is special, because it shows us a story of a unique person, prominent in some way. However, Rocketman is indeed a special case, not just because of who it is about, but because how the story is told.Usually, the biography movies are focused on a person's achievements and milestones: did this, came there, won that. As if we went through his or her Wikipedia page sections, turning the dry facts into a sequence that's fictionalized enough to make the viewer engaged. The thing about this approach is that it's someone else, a screenwriter or a producer, who does the 'guessing' part, trying to get into the protagonist's head and deduce his thoughts and feelings based on his actions. And whether that guessing was done right is usually an open question, either because the person has already passed away (like in the case of the recent Bohemian Rhapsody), or because he's not in direct contact with the crew.Rocketman, however, has Elton John himself as an executive producer. And from the very start of the film it becomes clear that this is gonna be a story told through _his_ eyes and imbued with his emotions. The whole AA-like rehab meeting backdrop creates a sense that Rocketman is a psychotherapeutic exercise for Reginald Dwight himself, his attempt to solve, or at least acknowledge, the existing lifelong conflicts and issues, and reconnect with his inner child, the latter even demonstrated explicitly, in a very direct but nonetheless touching way.Another absolutely fantastic feature of this film is how the musical elements are interwoven with the main narrative. Usually the singing and the dancing happens as some sort of a cut scene, which is somehow dictated by the current state of the plot but is generally something you might skip without missing anything crucial. Here, however, music _is_ the plot, the way to accentuate and convey the main moments of Elton's life, the songs' lyrics often given to the characters, basically showing us how this or that song was born and what it was inspired by. The visual sequences of such moments are fantastically surreal and organic at the same time, the Rocketman sequence being maybe the most complex, bizarre but at the same brutally raw act of cinematographic self-expression I've ever seen on screen. These four minutes simply take your breath away, and alone are worth spending two hours to watch this film.Is there a punch line? A moral lesson for us to learn? A late apology for not living up to someone's expectations? Honestly, I can't think of anything. The only curious fact I've learned from Rocketman is that apparently the guy who produced Elton John has also produced Queen at some point, and his characters from Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman are played by two different Game of Thrones stars and are shown in a very different way. Curious but utterly irrelevant. What's relevant is that music is and always will be for the living, for those who crave to express and to be heard. So live while you do, and love while you can.",8,1,1,15 April 2020
Wind River," Makes you feel ashamed for not feeling much
","Do you know these cases when you get to learn something which you know is important somehow, but you can't still quite touch the topic on the emotional level? It doesn't even mean that there are no emotions to touch, maybe it's just you being a heartless piece of wood. But you just can't help but stare, unable to make a link from what your mind perceives to your heart.Wind River is exactly this type of story. It's not that the story is not touching, nor is it not important. But you can't shake off the thought that you've seen it all a thousand times already: a depressed place, a bunch of sad and tired people who have nothing good coming at them in this life, some people still have goodness within, some have chosen not to care too much because it's easier that way. And somewhere along the way, one unlucky event follows the other, and something evil ensues.I can't decide whether it's my fault for not being able to take such matters to heart simply because they are not sensational, or it has something to do with the writing being kinda thin and the directing being kinda slow and sloppy at times. Not something major, just the little details which only rub it into your eyes yet another time that it's one of those 'sad, but sadly nothing new' kind of stories, something you wish you could've done something about to fix it once and for good, but you know at the same time that you simply don't have the power to.We humans suck in general. Thanks for reminding us once again of our rotten nature. Does it automatically make a film good because it's about this main law of life most of us don't really dispute?",6,2,5,19 February 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Looks solid, but feels uninspired
","Not a long time ago, in our very own galaxy, the filmmakers decided to create a prequel to Star Wars: A New Hope. And they really wanted to do it by the book: by putting in a list of recognizable actors, a plethora of characters and locations and tech, old and new, making the story emotional with the force of family bonds and the sense of duty. They even showed us a glimpse of Darth Vader as a cherry on top. Sounds cool, right?True, on the surface Rogue One looks very grand. But, as we have learned from the case of Death Star, even grand things may have very small flaws that ruin everything. And for Rogue One those flaws are characters and pacing.Indeed, with so much bound to happen and with only 133 minutes of running time, you must move quick to cram everything into the timeline. But for some reason Rogue One doesn't feel consistent in its density. At times it's painfully slow and almost boring, with people talking and arguing and debating some more. And at other times it flicks through characters and hops planets like a mad rabbit, causing a degree of 'what is this place/person again?' frustration even in a prepared SW viewer, while outright alienating the freshmen (although the same freshmen could digest The Force Awakens just fine).Another stone pulling Rogue One down is the main characters, or rather the actors playing them. I don't mind Felicity Jones or Diego Luna at all, they are fine actors per se. But they are not fit for the action figures. Jones may deliver a sharp punch at times, but mostly she makes that sad puppy face - and you just quit buying into her fighter spirit. Same with Luna: no matter what he does, he looks awfully tired and overwhelmed, dragging our mood down with him.Maybe if we had characters as vivacious and fierce as Rey and Finn as protagonists, the whole story would feel different. But we have what we have, and despite all the graphic lushness, a number of nostalgia-inducing moments, characters twisted and conflicted inside, and actual space fights, Rogue One feels like one major drag, where everyone does something, but only the bad guys actually believe in their cause. The space fights are overly long and tediously repetitive, the graphic lushness mostly resorts to cold space or desolate deserts, and even the character twists and development, with an unexpected sense of common purpose and a timely remorse for the former wrongdoings, have a whiff of generic movie psychology. Two slightly redeeming points of this film are the blind monk, but even he gets annoying towards the end with his repetitive chanting and inconsistent potency, and the Ben Mendelsohn's character, who is a typical Mendelsohn's not quite good but not entirely evil guy. As a mirror character of Domhnall Gleeson's General Hux from The Force Awakens, he's done a much better job. Too bad it wasn't enough to salvage the whole enterprise.When The Force Awakens turned out to be a soft reboot instead of being an independent story, I was hoping that maybe it was for the best and that way the filmmakers would be able to expand on the original story and give us additional depth, the chance that was skipped back in the time of the original trilogy. Rogue One is definitely an attempt to fill the blanks and deliver some background. But so far it's more of a miss than a hit. So hopefully it will be a lesson learned for the SW film crew: that spin-offs require as much effort as the main story films. You were inspired enough to bring the Star Wars back to life - now use that inspiration again and put it to good use.",5,4,8,24 March 2017
Zootopia," A children's guide to multiculturalism
","We were prey and predators once, antagonizing each other. But it was thousands of years ago, now we're all evolved, peaceful and equal. And if anything falls out of that paradigm then it's definitely a result of some malicious interference.That's basically the message of Zootopia. Calling it utopian is hardly insightful, but there's no better way to describe it. An upbeat and positive story of a little bunny who wanted to be different and to change the world by making it a kingdom of kindness and equality once again - that doesn't seem remotely realistic, even if the story was not about animals but humans. Still, with nice visuals and enough goofing around, it's exactly what would keep kids captivated for enough time so that their parents could get their much-needed precious rest. By being somewhere else or doing something else.And I mean it. Zootopia may be full of surprises for the young generation, but it's not a film that can provide a second layer an adult viewer could enjoy. There's no subtlety, instead, everything is explicit and for show, so any attempt to demonstrate some character development is somewhat staged. The difficulties are temporary and solve themselves without much labor. So, at the end of the day, even rooting for the happy ending is not too engaging because it never really seems that it could happen any other way.It's hard to blame Disney for a lack of the real-world complexity. After all, it's what they do: flicks for kids. And those flicks are more or less fairy tales where the good wins simply because they want us to believe in goodness and uphold it. However, there's a thin line between teaching the good and claiming that it's the natural way for everyone, which could be corrupted but is still something we all perceive equally. And while the fairy-tale thinking, despite being obviously naive, bears no big harm, the white lies of the latter approach create a much more distorting illusion. An illusion that we're all the same inside and that we all want to be the same.Come think of it, there might even be a second layer in Zootopia. Unfortunately, that layer looks like some sort of leftist propaganda, telling us that whoever we are, we have no other destiny but to stay united. That no matter who you are, a predator or a prey, a Muslim or an atheist, a Syrian refugee or a German burgher, living together is something that all of you must want and love. And if you wanna separate and set your own order of things, even if you're a vast majority, then there's something wrong with you and you're definitely a bad guy. No dude, stay put and love your neighbors, even if they bang at your wall and yell all night. And don't you dare expecting them to apologize for it!For more than half a century the real-world us were being told that there's no other way, and those who disagree should be branded fascists. So it's quite symbolic that I got to watch Zootopia just a few days after the British people showed the world that an alternative is possible. So nice try Disney, but sometimes it's better to ask difficult questions rather than to make up overly simple answers. And a word of advice to the audience: if you so desperately want a Disney's fairy tale about the world's issues, watch Tomorrowland instead. It's equally simplistic, but at least it leaves you the freedom of choice without stamping the moral labels on it.",6,7,18,27 June 2016
12 Angry Men," An ever-timely call to the human conscience
","No matter how prejudiced, preoccupied or plain angry you are, there's always a reason to slow down, step back and take a second look at things that seem obvious on the surface. That's basically the message of 12 Angry Men.It's been more than 50 years since this film was released, and obviously the rules of cinematography have changed since then. Now such theatrical films may feel somewhat odd or staged, and, indeed, 12 Angry Men is more of a play than a film. However, it's a rare occasion when the pure idea professed by a film becomes a manifesto that goes beyond a particular epoch or style, acquiring that kind of topicality that lives forever as long as there is a mankind.There's no point describing the events of the film, for they only serve as a means of delivering the film's message and call to our conscience, waking it up from the heavy dreams of our compromise-ridden lives. But it's the actors' work that turns the slow-paced narrative into a vivid showcase of emotions and characters. And even though Henry Fonda is the only big star of the cast, I can't say that the job is done by him alone. On the contrary, it's the men his characters confronts that really give the stage enough diversity and naturalness to feel real and true.The expected happy ending of the film doesn't really chime in with the gloomy cinema trends of the modern cinema. However, the hope that it brings has a deep symbolic meaning. 12 Angry Men isn't about opposing good and evil people. It doesn't divide us, instead, it tries telling us that, despite how we look and act right now, there's something good and honest and kind in all of us, and the future of this world, represented in this film by the life of a young boy tried for murder, depends on our ability to stay true to those sides of ours and find them within, however muddied they might be. Each of those twelve jurors had certain principles that he was ready to put above his personal fancy. And I can only hope that in the world of today our own anger, vanity or indifference are still not strong enough to make us lose our light completely.",9,0,1,6 August 2016
Spotlight," Maybe not the best, but undeniably the most important movie of 2015
","There are two genres of modern-day cinema that are strictly American: the courthouse drama and the journalism one. Why? Because what they work with are the true powers #3 and #4 in America, absolutely on par with the legislative and executive ones. I realize that democracy and separation of powers is not owned or copyrighted by the United States, but only there we seem to have a system where judges can - and sometimes successfully do - defy presidents and the press can break careers of the government officials of a highest rank. I don't think i love America all too much, but these are the things that America can - and should - be respected all around the globe. Still, something is rotten in the state of Denmark, and to make things right it's not enough to simply be a power - you have to actually use it sometimes to enforce that the good remains good and the evil is eradicated.Spotlight is a story of one case of such struggle. And this time it's not just Good vs Evil, it's about the evil that comes from the roots of the good itself. Because the way the film shows it, the Catholic Church is an alias for God himself for a great many people in America, and the problem of child molestation by Catholic priests is more than just a rare case of 'a few bad apples', it's a widespread phenomenon, a tendency, a real system.Of course, a journalism drama movie is mostly defined by the topic it covers, so it could be tempting to put the equals sign between the quality of a movie and the importance of the topic. However, it would be an understatement. A good movie is more than just a summary of the story, it's a drama (or even a tragedy) of simple people involved in it. And through their eyes we get to see what could be a dry text in an encyclopedia book as something living, vivid and emotionally disturbing. Something that we take personal.And that's where Spotlight really shines. What we are shown is not just the facts - which, i'm sure, most of us have known (at least to some extent) for a long time - but the way those facts hit the real people living in the same world the story belongs to. Facts that hit people like a hammer hits things: some of them break, some get bent and crooked and some remain straight and pierce the reality around them to make a difference. The team of investigative journalists from the Spotlight section of The Boston Globe is a pack of those straight things: no matter what pressure is put on them by the story they uncover, no matter how personal it ends up to be, their top priority is to serve the public good.What makes the story of Spotlight stand out is that the public is not completely aware of what is good for it. The Catholic Church is not an enemy people wanna fight, it's something that gives you faith, a ground to stand upon when the world around is shaking, but then starts corrupting all the good things it's done, leaving people confused, emptied and destroyed.It's one thing to just tell about those horrible devastating things. It's a completely different one to make you feel something about it. And to give you more than a one-dimensional sense of shame or anger or disappointment, but instead to fill you with a stinging cocktail of them all, is a task only a master can accomplish. And i believe that the team that made Spotlight had such masters in it.I believe that it was the characters and their portrayal by actors that made a difference. They are just a team of journalists and a couple lawyers doing their job. But at the same time it's not just a job for them. It's a personal stance. And each of them has different feelings because of it. Mark Ruffalo's character is energetic and angry, a true Hulk of a reporter (maybe even more believable as one than in Avengers or anywhere else), Rachel McAdams' characters brings soothing compassion only her face and voice are capable to convey. Stanley Tucci gives us an outsider with limited power who still tries to do the right thing. And Michael Keaton and Liev Schreiber show us the people who finally try to cha(lle)nge something that was neglected for way too long and go all-in while doing it. One by one, these characters don't seem like much special, but united by one thirst for justice, they become a force capable of making a major change.I can't say that Spotlight breaks the confines of its genre. Even with Michael Keaton in it, it's no Birdman, and it can't simply fly away from all the rules set for it. Still, it's a movie that tries its best not to be a cliché fest, and for a story that's bound by the facts it's based on, it has a surprising amount of freedom in it. So if you even remotely enjoy movies where people talk about complex things more than they yell or throw punches, give this one a try.",9,2,3,28 February 2016
Aquaman," Scale alone doesn't cut it. Even a golden one
","Marvel has Thor, and he was larger than life, at least while those charming blond curls lasted. Disney has Frozen, and it was all over the place. What could have DC done to prove that it's them who must be the most shiny and sparkling princesses of this realm? The answer is: to make The Most Epic Film Ever!Imagine putting together Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar, Black Panther, The Lord of the Rings, TRON, Blade Runner, Hunger Games, Mission Impossible, Fifth Element, G.I. Joe, King Arthur, Jurassic Park, and even Shrek to spruce things up a bit. Then crumb a ton of lesser blockbusters and blockbuster wannabes on top. Sounds terrific, 'but will it blend?' Of course it will! With the new WarnerBro 3000, we could mill this into a uniform, fine-grained mess, with giant seahorses, roaring sharks and blaster-wielding steampunk dudes bestriding them.Some superhero films at least have the decency to pretend to have some sense about them before plunging into the abyss of brain-convulsing insanity, but not Aquaman! Aquaman wants to be a Superman x Deadpool, both unparalleledly badass and unbelievably corny. Aquaman is a champion of heavy submarine-lifting and a wizard of cheesy oneliners. Aquaman flies, Aquaman jumps, he does all but sing Italian opera under the sea - and for that omission alone I'm indeed grateful.Being a total self-belittling goofus was maybe the only point of indulgence for the Aquaman himself, so at least we don't have to try to watch this farce with serious faces (like we had to with the latest Batman and Superman movies). Maybe if I was a woman, I'd find some another redeeming point about this movie, but seriously, if you just want to watch Jason Momoa look all buff, watch that Conan film instead, you would feel much smarter while you do. Watch this, however, if you've been sitting in a dark cellar for the last fifty years, and you want to recall what colors and moving objects look like. You might even be surprised by the (not so) delicately delivered ecological message - and start reducing, reusing and recycling right away.And if you do, please go ahead and recycle this trash first. It would make a better confetti filler than it had made a screen one.",4,1,1,31 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Absolutely ridiculous, yet the best possible outcome
","I don't know whether the comic book Thor is or has ever been popular, but its movie adaptation never stood much chance. It's simply impossible to make good cinema - which implies evolution and improvement - when your main theme revolves around almighty and technically unkillable gods which seem to be perfect by design. The first movie had the bonus of setting's and characters' freshness, but the sequel was basically a mess simply because the franchise hit the ceiling and started to suffocate.What Ragnarok did to Thor is both a blasphemy and a revival. The almighty ones are still mighty enough for the show, but aren't quite omnipotent anymore. More to that, this movie has much less hero'ing and much, MUCH more goofiness. Director Taika Waititi basically splits it in two: the 'typical Thor' stuff, with Asgardian theme, a serious villain and 'true' confrontation, and the 'comic relief' part which, from its neon disco start, was obvious to bear nothing but the ironic load - and that irony is exactly what makes Thor Ragnarok not merely watchable (which Dark World failed at) but even actually funny.The difference between funny and fun is so subtle that some don't see it at all - but there is one and it's important. By breaking the rules and turning a superhero film into a sequence of 'Thor and Loki walk into a bar'-like sketches, Ragnarok loses a clear point of view we could perceive it from. Should we still expect it to be coherent and consistent within its own rules? Or should we just let ourselves slide along the slapstick action because nothing is truly serious or important anymore? The film tries to cater to every side of this argument, but kinda ends sitting straight in between of two chairs, with no obvious failure but with a typical crack implying that its pants might've fallen a victim of the bold maneuver.Call me old-fashioned and rigid, but, despite all the funny quirks, this film feels more like a filler intro for the upcoming Infinity Wars epic where Thor will probably make sense again. If we accept such purpose as worthy though, Ragnarok isn't bad at all. Had it taken any other road, and we would've ended with another dark and tedious drag filled with mumbo jumbo and long fighting scenes with gloomy faces. Luckily for us, the faces here are far from that (maybe far enough to call them goldblum'y), so let's learn to enjoy the little things and have fun while they still serve it, shall we?",7,2,5,21 February 2018
"I, Tonya"," Pure pain on skates
","So, you have watched Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and thought that story was tough and Frances McDormand was terrific and nothing could ever be more tough and more terrific. Especially something with that hot blonde chick from The Wolf of Wall Street. Right? Wrong! So get ready for a big fat kick in the nuts, because sh!t has just got real.From the very beginning of the film you realize that it won't be pretty. An abusive ever-smoking and ever-cussing mother who would rather wipe the floor with her daughter than say a nice word to her. So destructive that even her rifle-shooting husband loses it and flees leaving a poor child completely unprotected. And when it turns from verbal abuse to the physical one, by her mother, by her boyfriend and later her husband, it's clear that it's not just not pretty - it's damn ugly, and that it's gonna get even uglier still.The trio of Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney does an unbelievable job of focusing a huge amount of anger, hate and frustration onto the single character, Tonya Harding, making almost every second of her screen time a pure pain to watch. You see her going through things you'd be waking in cold sweat from if you saw them in your dream. But, then again, for someone it was not a dream but an everyday routine. A vicious circle of abuse and humiliation, and the only way to forget it, even just for a minute, was through that ice rink, doing the only thing that would make you feel like something more than a pathetic loser with no single bright perspective ahead.And with that ugliness comes the true power of this film, of Robbie's performance, and of the real Tonya. The power that channels all the hate she received from all around into the thirst for skating, as if that ice rink is your arena where you fight for your life - or die trying. And when it's your life at stake, things are never chivalrous or graceful - so the way the Hollywood sex symbol dies and gives birth to a relentless competitive monster is a true miracle. And, just like a miracle of a real birth, it's full of pain for both the participant and for the ones witnessing it.What makes I, Tonya an even more shattering experience is that it's not just a made-up story, it's something that a living human being once went through. When you see her husband beat her and threaten her and even shoot a gun at her, you wish you could simply tell yourself that it's just cinema - but this time it's not quite so. When you see her mother come to her, pretending to be offering a helping hand when she's the most vulnerable - to end up being yet another vulture that came to feast on the prey that looks done but still keeps twitching - you wish you could say that no real child has come through such pain and betrayal, but you can't once again. You see a girl whose story was simply meant to be a tragedy from the very beginning - and you just wish it to be over. But she takes another hit, falls, yet for some reason refuses to stay on the floor.I guess I realize why this film missed the Best Picture Oscar, just like Margot Robbie missed the Best Leading Actress one. Just like the real world Tonya who outskates her rivals but fails to meet the expectations about her presentation, this film is technically the most riveting and intense story this year, with the leading performance being a big shiny diamond of a masterpiece, twice as precious because it wasn't an established Oscar winner who delivered it but a girl who till now was the most famous for doing a full frontal nude shot a few years ago.I'm not saying that the scores are rigged and that the competition was flabby. On the contrary, Three Billboards was a great film that I loved, and McDormand's performance is 100% Oscar worthy. The point is that I, Tonya is just not the image the Western cinematographic establishment is ready to associate women with yet - ugly and abused and blood-spitting. But, if in the figure skating world you could at least say that such are the house rules, and a pretty dress and a smile are something that matters at least as much as - if not more than - a triple axel, then the film industry community screaming 'equal rights to women!' at every corner and not acknowledging the most glaring case of one woman, fighting for her right for her skills to be valued and for herself to be treated as a human being, and another woman, incarnating all that fight and suffering that comes with it on the screen, is pure hypocrisy. Inclusion rider or not.",10,19,22,7 March 2018
Moana," Tangled joins Kung Fu Panda to save the environment
","There's a theory that in this world there is only a handful of truly original stories, first told ages ago, and the rest is just a combination and a rehash of those. Well, I'm not sure about the whole entirety, but the story of Moana definitely sounds kinda familiar. 'Sounds' being not just metaphorical, hehehe.In case you want your details and explanations dry, it's a story of two persons who join forces to overcome a greater evil, discovering their true selves along the way. Sounds indeed familiar. Right, because every other story out there, from Luke Skywalker to Jason Bourne, is about fighting evil and self-discovery. But is it a curse or a blessing in disguise? After all, being familiar doesn't necessarily mean being boring. And it's the details of the particular implementation that make all the difference.Speaking of details, it's simply impossible not to fall in love with Moana, that's how beautifully this film is drawn. The lush colors, the beautiful landscapes and the sea, the adorable characters - everything here is an eye candy. Add some decent (albeit slightly lacking variety) singing and a cute and vigorous young heroine - and you've gotten yourself another Tangled, this time without the castle and blonde hair but with tropical islands and catamarans to compensate for it.But while this film is undoubtedly a joy to watch, it falls just a little short of becoming a real hit. Probably because, unlike his latest predecessors, it didn't bring into the genre anything fresh. Tangled was the first really successful animated musical in decades. Frozen built on that success and redeveloped the world of fairy tales into a place where girls can actually take the lead. And while Moana has all the strong points of its older sisters, giving us just that is not entirely satisfying. Which doesn't mean that you won't have fun watching it, but the chances that Moana will win a permanent spot in your heart and memory are fairly slim.",7,6,14,17 February 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Best attitude since The First Avenger
","Can't say I'm a huge fan of the comic book movies - but I tend to watch all the big ones Marvel and DC release these days. Some are more fun, some are less - but it's always intriguing to see the evolvement of the approach to such kind of cinema.It may sound strange to some, but, despite Hulk's unbeatable strength, Thor's divinity or Tony Stark's wit, it's the Captain America movies that became a pinnacle of the Marvel way of storytelling for me. Maybe because, unlike every other super guy, Steve Rogers is not even about the display of power but rather about ethics. Ethics that's distinctively far from any preaching, but is instead aimed more at yourself, making yourself your own harshest judge. For an superhero action movie, such approach is not simply unlikely - it's unique, allowing the film to bring in the dramatic quality that genre seldom is able to possess.And now, after the pretty bland Ant-Man, disturbingly flashy Dr Strange and outright ridiculous GotG2, it's such a pleasure to see a Marvel film whose main character is as mature as he is modest. Sure, Peter Parker is still a kid, and the movie never misses a chance to prove it with a portion of goofing around, but he is much more than his goofy side shows. Which we seriously need to thank Tom Holland for. I have no idea how the genuine Spidey must be, but both Tobey Maguire and especially Andrew Garfield felt as if they wore the Spiderman suit mostly to show off themselves. Tom, on the other hand, is as natural in this role as a human being could possibly be, feeling like a true teenager for whom having such abilities is not simply cool but also awkward and even frustrating, and who's torn apart between the desire to become larger than life and staying down to earth.One thing to attribute that character versatility to is probably the fact that Peter has a mentor this time around. Which is curious, because the same exact reason that turns Tony Stark into a great support for Parker/Spider-man buildup makes Iron Man himself acutely annoying. But maybe that's just natural, after all, all parents are annoying in their kids' eyes. Still, despite all the Civil-War prehistory and Cap's current outlaw status, it feels as if Spider-man's much closer spiritually to Steve Rogers than to the guy who's actually sponsoring all his superhero'ing. Why do I get this feeling that such resemblance isn't just a random coincidence and that it's gonna be built upon later on...Another thing to love here is the villain. Well, apart from the tongue in cheek reference to the Inarritu's masterpiece, Michael Keaton's character is exactly what Spiderman movies (and Marvel universe as a whole) have been missing greatly: a villain who's formally a bad guy without a doubt but who you have mixed feelings and unlikely sympathy for nonetheless. Overshadowing everyone, Parker included, Adrian is a guy whose agenda doesn't only sound legit - it _feels_ like one: I couldn't help feeling that our 'billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist' dude is like a huge corporate colossus sucking in all the tech he could lay his hands on, while the small guys might be equally resourceful and even useful for the society, if only they weren't pushed out of the game by the big shiny players.One last thing that I can't get out of my head. Spider-man Homecoming is exactly what Deadpool might've aimed to be, but failed to: a film where clumsy isn't equal to devoid of a soul. Homecoming isn't perfect in any way, but it makes up for it in one single way: it's damn sincere. There's no over the top cynicism or self-irony, no self-adoration or self-loathing. Just a story of a kid who wants to be true to what his heart tells him to do and to be, and learns to do that throughout the story. That may sound not as cool as throwing a magic hammer or chopping your enemies to pieces with two katana swords, but to me it's a real superpower, the most worthy of them all.",7,0,1,10 February 2018
The Beach," Not your average trainspotting
","If we get to think about it, Danny Boyle's highest point as of 2000 was definitely the year 1996. Trainspotting was such a smash hit and a defining moment of the whole generation that it was just too tempting to try recreating its success. And, with a new emerging star of Leo DiCaprio, whose pretty face has been looking at us from the posters on the girl room walls ever since his Titanic days, the task seemed like a piece of cake: add some palms, beaches, spice it up with a French hottie and add some Robert Carlyle's brilliance as a cherry on top and a guarantee of the old-school spirit. Nothing could possibly go wrong. Or so they thought...Some spirit you can't deny this film indeed. Boyle's signature upbeat techno soundtrack, lush imagery and the whole sense of an acid trip do make this film look like its director's older child. And even though DiCaprio of 2000 is more of his annoying adolescent self than of that solid and mature figure he's become later, he is natural enough that you don't have to wish Ewan McGregor was back at his place.However, this time something's missing, some invisible but crucial glue that holds the story together and makes it evenly paced. Trainspotting was so amazing because it never dragged for a second. The Beach, on the other hand, feels much more jerky, combining the intensity-packed moments with outright droning or unnecessary filler. And while that depressing Scottish scenery could make even a filler look refreshingly novel, beaches of Thailand, although beautiful and calling, are more fulfilling for a tourist brochure than for a movie with a certain pretence of cultural weight.Still, it's not the patches of horrible dialogue and ridiculous continuity that bring this film down. Apparently Danny Boyle is better at building a story than dismantling it. And since The Beach' plot reaches its paradisaical climax only halfway through the movie, desecrating this paradise and bringing us back to the mortal world was a paramount task. And that's where it all went haywire, with lack of logic, consistency and sometimes even basic sanity. When an organic utopia falls apart it's never pretty, but one doesn't have to turn it into a travesty.All in all, The Beach is good at being a story of a spoilt kid's dream adventure going slightly sour. As for anything behind that pretty but shallow facade, like strong characters or a gritty story of their struggle for their ideals, don't hold your hopes too high.",5,1,1,21 August 2016
Closer," Life in a nutshell
","People are weird. Even if they love someone, they can't help hurting those people and themselves in addition. And the rest is just happening on a pure whim of chance or is simply secondary. And that's it.Seriously, expecting some moral lesson or a message from Closer is like having the same expectations about a Cohen brother film. There simply are none, that's just life. Less ironic as the brothers tend to depict it, but still both bizarre and inexplicably believable. Every single weird action or an illogical conversation is much more realistic than a thousand things we find reasonable. And that's the beauty of this film.It goes a bit over the top at times, purely for the dramatic effect, but that's the only imperfection this film affords itself. Oh, and sliding from light irony to pure intensity towards the climax. It didn't make this film any false, but darkened the mood enough to think that maybe life would be better without certain moments. Although if there's still something remotely resembling a message in this film is that no events are good or bad on their own and the beauty of this world is that even becoming a victim of a nasty prank might be a way to finding true happiness in your life.Nobody knows what will happen to them and to those they love the next moment. And sometimes it's even better not to know: too much truth could be poisonous. So just enjoy being happy fools, because the ignorant bliss is more fragile than you think.",8,2,4,23 January 2017
Doctor Strange," A big shiny interdimentional fart
","'He's compensating for something', that's what Shrek said when he saw the tall and impenetrable castle of Lord Farquaad for the first time. Well, in a way, the same could be said about Doctor Strange. This film has so many talented and trending actors involved that it could either be absolutely great or... or all that talent and gravitas were simply a distraction from something profoundly failing. Cloud Atlas was an example of the former. This film, alas, is one of the latter.Doctor Strange goes off the hinges from the very beginning, when you see people as serious and dramatic as Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton go full Last Airbender and start waving hands as if they had a seizure. You might be hoping that it's just an awkward intro and another acclaimed batch made of Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams would do better. Alas, that talent also gets wasted on waving hands and saying pompous nonsense. Well, except for McAdams, who basically remains her typical cute/sensitive/soothing self, thus giving this film one of its scarce redeeming points.However, it's not the characters that cause Doctor Strange to fail. Separately, they are rather amusing, and the talent and charisma the actors still possess bring in a handful of small ironic or witty or indeed dramatic and touching episodes which we could actually enjoy.But when the main story kicks in, it all goes sideways. Because the world of Doctor Strange is not just lacking a strong guideline. It's also ridiculously rehashed, looking like a product of a perverse carnal love of Harry Potter and The Matrix that took place inside Christopher Nolan's mind while he was trying to go deeper by taking another LSD pill and reaching into that fractal trip. It might even sound cool, like who doesn't love HP or The Matrix or Inception. But, albeit intricate and appealing by themselves, together those concepts are as compatible as a fish, a dog and a bird: pulling each in its own direction and ultimately letting the combo go stale. Towards the finale the film gets so dull and generic that you would have to force yourself to keep attention to what's going on.It's obvious that, after several decades of comic books and almost 20 years of screen adaptations, Marvel is in crisis of coming up with new interesting characters to build new stories around, while the old characters gradually wear off. The last Iron Man was a mess, the last Thor was a dark dullfest, and a fresh addition of Ant-man resulted in a complete travesty. The only hero that still pulls his (and his colleagues') weight is Captain America, which is even more surprising considering that he's far from the most popular superhero Marvel owns. The studio still manages to mix its toys in rather interesting ways, making them fight either alongside or against each other. So my only hope for Doctor Strange is that his addition wouldn't ruin that already overcrowded mob scene. Because in Marvel's world there are way too many marvels already.",4,2,5,15 February 2017
Interstellar," Monumental, but lazy, stumbling and ultimately confused about its own message
","Now, months after Interstellar hit the screens and days after it got its home media release, one can already start summing up the impact this movie made. It may not have caught up with Nolan's other top products like The Dark Knight and Inception in terms of ratings and popularity yet, but it's already obvious that Interstellar was his attempt to make even a bigger bang. The longest of Nolan's movies so far, Interstellar sends us to a humankind-saving journey across the Universe, at the same time putting to test everything that we are used to calling humanity.This movie was simply bound to be monumental. Taking into account Nolan's love for complex plots oversaturated with details and the premise of galactic scale, we could expect a spectacle which only Kubrick dared to stage before in his 2001: A Space Odyssey. Yet Nolan doesn't simply call his bet, he raises it, putting the fate of the human race itself on the table. And since it's not 1968 anymore and Christopher Nolan has no shortage of either money or technology, one thing is for sure - that Interstellar is as visually stunning as films can be today.Now that was an obligatory piece of praise since one cannot deny Interstellar the merits mentioned above. And, of course, for some audience those merits will be enough, since it's not so difficult to imagine people who get all orgasmic from any high-budget sci-fi film or run in circles yelling 'Spaceship! Spaceship! Spaceship!'. But, truth to be told, not all is perfect in the glossy Nolan kingdom.And i'm not even talking about the counter-scientific statements this movie makes. After all, any good science fiction at some point has to venture out into the unknown, with only the author's imagination to guide it per aspera ad astra. What i'm talking about is the quite earthly ground this movie is based on. And it is obvious that even the best spacecraft would have a hard time lifting off if the ground beneath it isn't solid.Just a quick glimpse into this topic, since i don't wanna turn a review into a bashing. A piece of dialogue:<ul><li>You're a well-educated man, Coop.</li></ul><ul><li>And a trained pilot. And an engineer.</li></ul><ul><li>Okay, well, right now we don't need more engineers. We didn't run out of television screens and planes. We ran out of food.</li></ul>How do you like it? This is supposed to be a futuristic world, where the apex of human technology is in the past and the dwindled humankind is striving for food by engaging in manual labor. Yet we are told that engineers, the salt of the modern earth who can automate just about anything, including the food production, are not needed anymore. Because the bosses are happier with people driving tractors than with people knowing how to make machines do the job. After that, the logical consistence of the movie takes a nosedive and never straightens itself. Blight that breathes nitrogen, which somehow leads to the decrease of oxygen. Making the whole space station spin for two years simply to make the crew feel some gravity for a few minutes before they go to hiber-sleep. And so on, and so on.But Interstellar's worst is not being handicapped about displaying the technical stuff. It is trying to add a deeper, more humane message to the film, yet being handicapped at that too. Here, people do not simply save mankind from its demise. They proclaim love, yes, love as a driving force of evolution, a not yet fully understood mechanism of survival of the species, the only thing besides gravity that can pierce through space and time, etc. And this hippie 'love is the answer' nonsense is served with a dead serious face from people who only seconds ago were talking formulas and science.Well, okay, if love is the answer then at least show us that love. Instead, we have a protagonist, a father of two children, whose only motivation is to come back home and save them. Yet for some reason he only really cares about his daughter, totally ignoring his son, as if he doesn't matter simply because he didn't throw a fit when his dad left them for a space mission. Moreover, his son is even displayed in the film as some sort of a bad guy, simply because he allowed himself to feel abandoned (as he actually was). Even when Coop returns back to people, he doesn't even ask a single question about his son. Now that's a true father's love that saved the world, no sh*t.Still, Interstellar does have its powerful moments. Maybe the best one is the story of Dr. Mann (Matt Damon), which showed how people are actually unwilling to die, even if the fate of humankind depends on it, even if they knew beforehand that it might be a part of the plan, even if they devised that plan themselves. Once again, it proves that the most emotional yield is given by the stories in which a man's nemesis is a man himself. Too bad that Interstellar much often prefers to shows us battles with lifeless things like time and gravity.Despite its flaws, Interstellar is a very enjoyable high-quality product. Unfortunately, the word 'product' describes it better than 'art'. Like those fancy rectangular robots, it is shiny, useful and sometimes even funny. But still ultimately soulless.",7,1,4,17 March 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Anger, what it begets, and what to do about it
","When you think about great cinema, you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon. The likes of Gone With the Wind or Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, such films span through decades or cover the major historic events.But a great story isn't necessary grand on the outside. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is like a tiny rabbit hole size of those three wooden screens, but stick a head in - and you'll see a huge empty space laid with people's sorrow, guilt and regret. And that emptiness sucks you in and leaves no way to stay untouched.But there's also hope. Hope for justice. Hope for retribution. And maybe even hope that it's still not too late to change something, or to change yourself. That nothing is absolutely black and white. That even in the darkest moments of our lives there's some room for a sense of humor, maybe a sad and bitter one but still one worth a warm smile.This world is a crooked place, where crime often goes unpunished. And Peter Dinklage's small role in this film, as a reference to another not so pretty world where the 'happily ever after' way doesn't quite exist, is a stinging reminder of that. TBOEM does not, however, try to pull the magic sword out of the stone and go crush the wicked and protect the righteous. Instead, it shows that sometimes, crumbling under the weight of the evil things that fall on us, we lose our own limits and become those who sow evil ourselves. Anger does beget even more anger.And maybe the reason that makes America great indeed is that, with all the messed up stuff happening without and within, it's in your culture to value forgiveness, something Christianity teaches everyone but not everyone tends to listen. To suffer without guilt, yet to offer a helping hand to your offender when he's down and wounded. To break the circle of evil and help each other wake that yearning for decency that everyone has inside them, albeit dormant sometimes. Forgiveness is tough, and, just like revenge, it doesn't bring back the things - or people - we've lost. But at least it helps to hold onto what could still be here.Yeah, it's just a movie, and most people aren't as deep and philosophical as the movie characters can afford to be. But if some unrealistic complexity (and sometimes even wisdom) of the simple people could make some real regular people on the other side of the screen stop and think over their own real regular ways, maybe that's exactly what we need from time to time. Because life is still here, and so are the multiple choices it gives, And which road to choose today, we can still decide along the way.",9,201,283,17 February 2018
The Devil Wears Prada," Everything that men knew about women all along
","Let me begin by saying that i'm actually very grateful that i got to watch this film. Don't get fooled by the rating, because the gamut of emotions this film is capable of inducing in you is really unprecedented.At first TDWP seems like a regular '@sshole boss vs intimidated employee' flick. You know, one of those generic 'feel real bad and then feel real good' movies where the punchline is always some kind of a liberation act when all the previously suppressed frustration is finally let out, which by some miracle sets everything right.But no, this film went quite a bit ahead. It actually attempted at showing us a Stockholm complex in action. To show us how a person with self-esteem, ambitions and education can turn into a mindless female robot crazed with vain glamour and conspicuous consumption of the fashion industry. A person who is treated like sh!t at work but grows to love that slave's status. A person who betrays her former moral ideals for an illusion of success and importance. A person who doesn't simply fail at saying 'No' to the things that frustrate her or make her feel uncomfortable but actually goes to embrace screaming 'Yes!' to them all at the top of her lungs.Now that's how The Devil Wears Prada could've made history. Just by doing this and not saying anything else. Because that would've been the boldest move in the history of modern cinema, an apex of naked sexism and an attempt, beautiful in its insane straightforwardness, to show women as they really are: DUMB. And not just dumb, but devoid of any will to control their lives. Devoid of any intention to stop an abusive boss whose abuse is so blatant that any person with even a tiniest spine would've slapped or - even better - sued her, or to resist a creepy so-called admirer and a drunk rapist who's so full of himself that it's plain ugly. Devoid of any guidelines in life that would've helped making right choices at the crucial times. Leave it like that, and you get an all-time masterpiece, albeit hated by the whole womankind and scorned by the p#ssy whipped critics. Who would've cared? The mankind would still worship it for finally making a statement about what everyone of us knew all along.Alas, dumbness is more common in Hollywood than courage these days. And since TDWP's writers are both female (and the director is most certainly p#ssy whipped), the film didn't stop after the second act. Instead, it decided to give us a naive attempt at a protagonist's redemption, followed by an equally sappy happy ending. Which only proves the point the film was making all along: that only a totally dumb woman would think that a few smiles and a couple of 'i'm sorry's could fix any predicament you got yourself into.Unfortunately, it's not a movie character that is the source of all this idiocy. It's the people who created, approved, produced and eventually eagerly consumed it to later view it as their role model. Which ultimately turned what could've been a revolutionary coming-out of all the modern industry of making money out of the women's inherent vices into an outright advertisement of one. A highly expensive advertisement most people even paid to watch. A hymn of stupidity, just like those $1900 handbags.",3,1,2,12 November 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," Jason Bourne's highest point
","How many movie trilogies do you know that don't go south towards the end? The answer is, even aside of the spy movie genre there aren't too many, and all of them are classics. Now, Matt Damon & Co made that list one item longer.True, there's not that big of a competition in this genre, for the spy film franchises that take themselves seriously and live long enough are so rare that you could count them by one hand's fingers. There's James Bond, there's Ethan Hunt, and there's another JB now. But Mission Impossible has long transcended that line beyond which the laws of reality don't apply. As for James Bond, it's a phoenix that can only live on by burning up at the end of its every incarnation, and Spectre was a perfect example of such pyre. Yet, Jason Bourne managed to walk that line between carnal ashes and mythification and do it with flying colors.The first group of people we should thank for that remarkable achievement is the screenwriters. The spy thrillers are only as good as their story, and when the story bends under scrutiny, the whole movie goes down. In that aspect, the Jason Bourne trilogy was played brilliantly, with enough loose ends to keep us involved throughout the three-act story and with enough wit to tie them up in a single convergence point towards the finale. The second film might have dragged a bit and has gone over the top a few times (the unbelievable yellow taxi car chase being one of them), but it was worth the amazing two-point transition into the third film that not just redefined the meaning of the second film's ending but also gave us a new angle to look at the main character at. Such things don't happen occasionally, that's an intentional masterpiece, something I simply can't help admiring.And of course there's Matt Damon. Now, in 2016, we know him as a big star. And of course he was already a star in 2002, for his role in Good Will Hunting was not to ignore. Yet it seems that it's Jason Bourne that really made Mr Damon who he is today, a solid all-round performer who's able to bring a deep emotional charge into a whirlwind of action.Speaking of action, it alone could earn the JB trilogy a place among the titans of the genre. The fight scenes and the chases are what make these movies hold their viewers at the edge of the seat, and no shaky camera or rapid cuts could deprive them of the sense of true realism that such action monsters as Mission Impossible or Fast and Furious tend to lack these days. Even though Mr Bourne manages to dispatch his opponents without seemingly breaking a sweat (and definitely without breaking anything more vital), he still looks and feels like a human being who's not deathproof but simply trained enough to outplay it.Even though the producers' greed made them try to capitalize on the JB success (which they failed at, it seems) and release a totally disposable spin-off movie, it doesn't at all reduce the trilogy's value, making The Bourne Ultimatum a Skyfall of its franchise, but without the disgrace of Spectre. The phoenix didn't burn down, it just flew away to its own lost paradise. Off the grid, exactly where Jason Bourne had wished to stay.",9,2,2,27 August 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," A film Freddie would have liked
","My acquaintance with Queen was in the mid-90's, when I was in middle school, it became my first real music passion and still has a tender spot in my heart. So forgive me if I'm a little biased...Still, I think Bohemian Rhapsody is a film Freddie really deserves. Not a massive and monumentally serious biopic, with lots of interviews with the band members, friends, relatives and whatnot. But a true 'live fast, die young' flick. One in which it doesn't matter how closely the actors look to their real-life prototypes, how correctly the plot follows the truth of the story and how blatantly it uses the archive sound instead of making some of its own.This is not about Queen. Queen is four people, and we'd need way more time to look into their lives and their heads to make it substantial, and such substance, in addition to the remaining trio's old and gaunt faces, would be just boring, if not miserable. And Queen was never like that.So this is a hymn to Freddie himself. Not to the pop culture icon he's become in our eyes, but to the person he's been offstage. The vulnerable and sensitive, but nonetheless flamboyant and daring and believing that punching a hole in the sky was his true and only purpose. Even if half of the events of this film are pure fiction, even if all of it's invented just to give us a taste of what it could possibly have been, that divine flame we could feel within that person is still genuine enough to justify the whole endeavor....In that almost academic and definitely too prudent Queen story I read as a kid, they said Freddie could've possibly lived longer - if only he resorted to serious treatment, pressure chambers and so on. But that would mean stomping on the way he lived - and turning into a house-dwelling fungus, just to survive some more. So he decided to burn out but remain who he was, until he wasn't. In that sense, putting the last period in this story right after Live Aid, without six more years and two more albums, follows the same way Freddie would've respected. Not waiting for the last flame to die out but to go with a bang. So that we don't cry that it's over, but that we smile that it happened.And for all that happened, Freddie and the rest of the guys, I thank you all.",7,1,2,16 February 2019
Baby Driver," A hot ride indeed, but still not a space rocket
","If you're reading this then you have probably read a lot of other reviews by now. So you know the upper sides of this film. It's fast-paced, full of slick dialogues and hot car chases. Acting isn't exactly stellar, so isn't the story, but both are fine just enough to keep you entertained.What you might not know is that, despite all its glossy charm and a pretty mighty cast (Kevin Spacey might be an a-hole off stage, but a fine actor he remains), this movie is still a rehash of the old 'good guy force-tied to a bad company' story. The old-school soundtrack trope, one which worked so well for Guardians of the Galaxy, is effective in this film too, adding to its mojo, but dig one layer deeper - and everything becomes way too black and white and convenient. Ansel Elgort is charming and handsome as ever, and his character is peculiar but nonetheless charismatic. The bandits each have a one track mind they over-exploit in each scene. And even Doc's latest switch of tune - the 'I was in love once' one - is as expected as it is cheesy. All rolling to a finale convenient and satisfying.I liked Baby Driver for being just what it is - an awesome popcorn flick. It's great at that, never pretending to be anything greater. So if you want to watch a movie to have fun, then choosing this one will make you a happy person. But anything outside the entertainment scenario - including the thought-provoking part - is clearly not what Baby Driver can deliver, no matter how fast it rides. So be straight to yourself and expect no Drive from this film - to avoid any possible disillusionment afterwards.",7,0,2,14 January 2018
The Revenant," A spiritual journey from nowhere to beyond
","Iñárritu's been a hot commodity lately, and his Birdman was a movie well deserving its fame, a perfect combination of intricate style, witty multi-leveled delivery and free spirit that made it such a unique joy to watch. A year later, the maestro is back with a new story, way gloomier and deeply rooted in symbolism.In a way, The Revenant is the Birdman's dark twin. Both films concentrate on the problems of a person struggling with finding a new path in his life after the old bridges have been burned. This time, however, looking back is only a source of sorrow and grief which can hardly be a guide on your way forward. In fact, there is no way forward for Hugh Glass, just like there is no reason for him to live. And when the last tiny thread tying the hollow present to the beloved past is forcibly torn, Glass' will to live comes back once more - just to drag back to the void those responsible for it.Throughout the film one can't shake off the feeling of illusiveness of everything that happens on screen. This time Iñárritu relies heavily on various visual tricks like filming through a fish-eye lens or a camera that dashes around the scene like a trapped animal. Combined with a dark troubled score, this produces a sense of discomfort that builds a glass (no pun intended) wall between the audience and the characters, not letting us too close to them and preventing an emotional participation in the events of the film. At times, The Revenant feels like a dream you got caught in, unable to wake up, and the only thing you can do is to simply follow the path charted by some grim mastermind.However, the director's brilliant and truly Oscar-worthy intentions are constantly foiled by one thing this film has been praised the most for: Hugh Glass himself. The unnatural vitality of the character portrayed by DiCaprio requires some suspense of disbelief, but is not a problem per se since it's clear that he's drawn forward by something stronger than mere human nature. But Leo himself simply belongs too much to the world of the living to fit this role. He's been too alive through all his career, and this time, working so hard for that Oscar, he, in my opinion, simply failed to show us how it feels to be dead inside and be pushed forward by a greater mission. Unlike Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald, who actually felt like a savage power with no real humanity inside, as if it went away with his scalp.Can't say that The Revenant is a bad movie. On the contrary, it's a fine piece of cinema well-thought and well put together. However, in an attempt to take the place warmed by Dead Man by Jim Jarmusch, it kinda missed and fell into a pit nearby. But the pit is shallow, and Leonardo DiCaprio is so good at crawling, which allows the film to remain entertaining, albeit at the cost of a blurred concept.",7,2,3,10 April 2016
American Psycho," A Clockwork Orange of the noughties
","It's the 80's outside, and it looks like Patrick Bateman is living a true American dream: a job of an investment banker, a pitch-perfect physical shape, a pack of high-status jock friends and a hot fiancée. But is he really? Because behind this mask of success there are real demons, skeletons in the closet and heads in the freezer.To some adepts of Stanley Kubrick, even comparing their beloved masterpiece to anything else would be a sacrilege. But those films are indeed strangely similar. Even though the former bathes in a cosmopolitan decadence and preaches about a conflict between a citizen and a state, while the latter is more about an American mission of the world's guardian and a conflict between a person and a society. But both of these films choose a very peculiar means of delivering their messages - a sheer and unobscured violence, gore and sexual narcissism.To be honest, A Clockwork Orange didn't work for me. Partly because it lost most of its shocking charge over the decades, and the scenes that must've been extra provocative in the 70's are now nothing too special. But it's not just that. The main character of the movie was always just a part of a bigger system, something he might have loathed but at the same time would've been helpless and even pointless without, like a fish without water. Which makes the overall drama less intense and more like a sketch from a regular 'homo homini lupus est' life.In American Psycho however, the drama resides within a single man, in his life and (or maybe it would be better to say 'or') in his head. Patrick Bateman tries his hardest pretending to be a normal fish, but he's already suffocating in the poisonous pond of his life, and nothing, even the drastic measures, can help him truly embrace it and feel fulfilled.Maybe this concept works better because, unlike a bizarre and rather dystopian world of A Clockwork Orange nobody could imagine living in, American Psycho shows us a very believable image of an American upper class citizen's life. So believable that Patrick Bateman could easily be neighbors with Bud Fox from Wall Street. Which only makes it even more shocking to see how different are the things those seemingly similar people do behind the closed doors of their vast apartments.One could not talk about this film and not mention Christian Bale's performance. We all know him as a versatile actor capable of doing extraordinary things to make a bang out of his roles, and if you doubt that then simply look up that pic with a chart of weight changes he made himself go through in order to fit into his roles. Yet this time it's not just the weight. It's that unabated self-adoration and self-loathing. Separately those things had been done a million times, and i could probably recall Philip Seymour Hoffman being natural doing each of them for various roles, but i have yet to see a better display of a character showing them both at the same time. Still, such brilliance has its drawbacks. Because, even cast along with such heavyweights as Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon, Bale simply outshines everyone else, effectively making this film mostly a single actor's performance. What is worse though is that the rest of the cast don't even seem to care to make their presence on screen memorable or at least noticeable.Despite being set in the time of Reagan's presidency, American Psycho is obviously a child of late 90's and early noughties. I'm trying hard to remember when the movies started showing this mental shift from glorifying success and making it an apex of human desires and dreams to despising this glorification and rejecting the vanity it brings and symbolizes. Maybe it was Fight Club that pioneered this niche, in which case its cult status gets another reason to exist. But while Fight Club uses mental illness as a main ingredient for an action thriller where the protagonist does break the system he hates so much, here in American Psycho we are ultimately left clueless whether these breakouts of insanity really took place. What if they didn't - and all this was just a sick cry for help from a soul forever trapped in the cage society put it in? Or maybe they did - and the society simply didn't care, busy with its everyday routine. Wouldn't it be even worse?",8,1,2,31 July 2015
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A franchise on drugs
","Most of us have dreams. Not the ones about having a billion bucks or getting that girl, but the night time ones. So most of us would agree that in that twilight zone our brain unleashes its creativity, no longer bound by the constraints of reality, and that allows us to dream the most crazy and amazing stuff. And most bizarre and incoherent also. Especially if there were some substances consumed beforehand.In that sense, I'd agree with those who say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animation film we could dream for. I'm far from the comic book culture, but even I can admire the visual style of this film, made so that any still out of it could actually pass for a real comic book's frame. That aesthetics is brilliantly done, no questions about it.The rest of admiration, however, heavily depends on how much you are into TV cartoons, comic books and Spider-Man himself. This film loves to reiterate over and over again that it's based on an established universe, so there's an abundance of Spider-Man movie references and other allusions. If such things make you gasp in awe and maybe even shed a tear of nostalgic affection, you'll love it all. But for me as a non-Spider-man-acolyte, this soon became somewhat boring. I wanted to see something new, something unexpected.And something new I did receive! In the form of a slapstick action multiplied by the pseudo-scientific stuff as grotesquely absurd as it was far-fetched. And I can clearly see how Sony was inspired by the likes of Big Hero 6 and its outright fusion of the Western and Eastern kid entertainment culture, and of Ant-man and even Dr. Strange and their abundance of moving colored specks and nonsensical words in lieu of common sense. The deeper we go into the Spider-Verse, the more bizarre it looks, feels and acts, until we're forced to accept that there are no rules anymore to cling to and that pigs can indeed fly, just as trains.I do appreciate bringing a new stylistic vision into the world of full feature animation. But I can't say as much about bringing a popcorn bucket of LSD along with it, turning everything into a final battle from Final Fantasy, with its constant sparkle and rush and a muffled feeling that it used to mean something, but now you can't remember what exactly and it's way too late to stop and think about it.It was a fascinating trip while it lasted, but praising it as something more than that would be like retelling your dreams to someone else: you'd end up realizing how little sense your words make and feeling embarrassed about the whole idea.",6,4,8,10 March 2019
Warrior," A beast in man tamed by financial motivation and family values
","Over the course of history we saw a great lot of the fight movies. There was Bloodsport and Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and The Fighter. In all these movies there were the heroes, each of them having their own reasons to keep going, to keep fighting. Fighting for their friends, for their pride, for the sake of proving themselves, for their dreams. Or at least for some vain glory. Those heroes were facing the improbable odds, the unbeatable foes - and the only thing that made them victorious was their motivation, their goal.Warrior, a new member of the fight film family, tries to play it right, play it modern. No more black and white, good and evil, righteous and deceitful. It brews a nice steaming pot of conflict, adds the characters, each twisted and flawed in their own way, spices it all with a dark prehistory that connects them together, and finally boils it all down to a burning mix of action, emotions and adrenaline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, both teeth and fists clenched. Sounds like a perfect game, right?Indeed, seconds after the credits start rolling, accompanied by that mighty blockbusterized Beethoven theme, when your head is still hot and your armpits sweating from all the fighting you imagined yourself being a part of, i'm sure you wanna say that you just saw one of the best, if not THE best fight movie of all times. And yes, in terms of the action and the tension that was continuously building up towards the climax, Warrior does hit well above par. Much higher than the same Million Dollar Baby where the last third of the movie gives you almost no action at all, letting your steam cool off and leaving you confused and unsatisfied. But thankfully Warrior is our hero tonight, and we should be grateful for that unparalleled and non-compromising feeling it gave us.Hovewer, if we too do it right and modern and dig one layer deeper, the things we uncover might be quite a surprise. Because it turns out that Warrior played a very unlikely, almost a cynical trick on us: it sold us the movie where a man is made a hero for fighting over... money.After all, who are our protagonists? Two brothers with a dark shadow of the past lying between them and the father figure looming in that shadow.There's Tommy, the younger one, cast away and left alone to take care of his dying mother. Who lives for one goal - one dictated by his own honor and responsibility. A beast in a human form who's willing to kill and die for that goal. Whose only brethren are those who've gone through literal hell shoulder to shoulder with him. And there's Brendan, the older one, who used to be envious for his father's love to his sibling. Who changed loyalty to his kin for a girl's love and became a happy family man, with a wife, two kid daughters and a job as a school teacher. The only thing he doesn't have is a money to pay for his mortgage.The stories of both brothers are hard and dramatic. But for the first time in the fight movie genre, the cause of providing for a dead friend's family is antagonized by a personal housing crisis. Nobody's dying in Brendan's family, he simply refuses to move to a smaller house or an apartment because it's a personal matter to him. Yet from the get-go we are almost forced into rooting for Brendan. He has more screen time, he's shown as a good husband and a loving father. Even his school students seem to adore him. While Tommy is portrayed as an abusive and aggressive chaotic pill-eater and alcohol-drinker, who has no place in this life to call his own, no person to call his friend, no love neither for his father nor his brother. Just an animal at large, roaming around and trying to survive somehow.One might think that Nick Nolte's character of Paddy, an alcoholic-turned-sober father, who's equally rejected by both of his sons for his actions in the past and who now finds refuge in the 'Moby Dick' audiobook, could become a bridge between Brendan and Tommy and between their causes. Indeed, up until some point there was hope in it, and Paddy's attempts to mend what's been broken felt most sincere and endearing.But the director and co-writer Gavin O'Connor never dared to sail as far and deep as Herman Melville did. And when the contract between the outcome of the Captain Ahab vs Moby Dick confrontation and the prescribed ending of the film itself became too obvious to ignore, Paddy was comfortably written off without any reasonable explanation whatsoever, to be reduced to a distant and wordless part of the setting.After that cowardly transformation we are left face to face with the predictable ending that's been built for us through the whole movie. The good husband and a loving father wins, the animal in a human form loses. And with that a new moral testament is written down in the history of the fight movie genre: that no matter how improbable are your odds and how uncrushable your foes seem, you're bound to win if you have a wife, kids and, most importantly, a mortgage to pay. Because the modern American hero must live by the family values and never inflict loss to financial institutions.And the rest... the rest is negligible.",7,0,2,10 April 2015
Ratatouille," Not without a charm, but lacking depth
","I first saw this film back in 2007 when it just came out in the movie theaters. Back then i hadn't seen The Incredibles or Toy Story yet, so it's no wonder that Ratatouille seemed like a breath of fresh air, something new, vivid and inspiring. There was simply no much competition in the field those days, except for Shrek maybe, which had already passed its peak by that time. And now, eight years later, Ratatouille and i got a chance to meet again.The times have certainly changed since then. Plus, now we have some new prominent examples of fine animation like Kung Fu Panda or How to Train Your Dragon. And while ignorance is indeed bliss, knowledge makes you re-evaluate certain things, and your cinematic experiences are not immune to that.The most important thing that's literally screaming at you from the screen is how goofy and childish this film is. Of course, all the animation movies try to be appealing to the kids so some goofiness can't be helped. But Ratatouille wholeheartedly embraces the buffoonery, trying to turn it into the film's major source of charm and the main selling point. And while France had its history of brilliant and lovable clowns like Louis de Funès or Pierre Richard, Ratatouille fails to reproduce that fine balance of hysterical and touching that made those actors and films they starred in so different.But all that clowning around could be easily forgiven if Pixar hadn't missed the spot with the dramatic angle. The most intense and emotionally saturated animation films these days inevitably revolve around the topic of coming of age. That genre is dearly beloved by me because there's nothing as mind-blowing and revealing and literally touching you to the very core as the process of transformation from an adolescent into an adult. It's something relevant to everyone, and a film that truly resonates with the kids' current feelings and is able to bring the memories of those feelings in the adults has a chance at being a true epiphany, a family-binding moment of sincerity and understanding that matters so much in the world of today when the fast pace of life drives generations further and further apart.Here we had not one but two struggling heroes in existential crisis. Remy, a brilliant rat chef, is torn between his rat's nature, which his family never misses a chance to impose on him, and his humanly passion for cooking. And Linguini, a loser kid trying his best not to screw up for once and outgrow the shadows of the father figures he's been surrounded with.Unfortunately, in Ratatouille the whole sub-plot of that transformation of personality is wrapped up so abruptly that it seems as if no transformation has occurred at all. Both Remy and Linguini fight for their freedom to be themselves and to do what they love without being told what to do by someone else, however, they both end up dependent on each other and ultimately not free at all. And their act of liberation that was supposed to change everything ends up being nothing but a deus ex machina device when the world suddenly decides that it's not gonna interfere anymore. Compare it to the culmination of the same Kung Fu Panda and you'll understand why some movies give you that goosebumpy cathartic feeling while others slide past you with no aftertaste at all.Ratatouille is by no means a bad film. It has enough kindness and charm to make the time you spend watching it enjoyable. However, the tone it speaks to you at the end is pretty much the same as what the film started with, and that lack of maturity makes it rather forgettable in a long run.",7,0,0,11 November 2015
Captain America: Civil War," When titans clash
","Everything flows, everything changes. And the superhero movies are no exception. The times of characters whose human side resorted to a single facial expression are over, now the world wants to see heroes who are more human than godlike.Steve Rogers, a character I hardly knew before the new era Marvel films, is arguably the most prominent landmark of that switch. He started off as a human, whose humanity was his only strength, and remained a human even after having been turned into that super powerful machine called Captain America. Batman, Hulk or Iron Man are all fancy and stuff, but it's Captain America whose films make it one level deeper and one step further into blending the CGI action and the real drama of human relationships.Last two times these Cap's qualities were used to fight super villains. Now, when there seem to be no sinister forces on the horizon, Steve Rogers must face a new challenge, coming from within the very nature of the world he pledged to defend, and from the very league of extraordinary gentlemen he's teamed up with to do it. Of course, we are our own worst enemies, so there's nothing new. But when politics starts meddling in, there's no worst thing that couldn't get any worse.There's no point re-telling the events of CA:CW. However it's clear that Marvel really wanted to push every aspect of the film to the limit, even the smallest details. Because when even for the small episodic roles you cast such solid figures as Martin Freeman and Marisa Tomei, it's clear that you don't want to leave anything to chance. And since the action was always a selling point for the Marvel movies, one can be sure that CA:CW won't fail to deliver.Yet, while exploring the almost uncharted territories of the questions like whether humans should try to subdue a force that they can't control or whether a public consensus is worth casting aside your personal beliefs, this film treads a bit too carefully, unwilling to burn any bridges leading to the old unanimous days. The antagonism between Tony Stark's corporate ways and Steve Rogers' faith in individual freedom was clearly there from the very first meeting of the two guys, and The Age of Ultron has brought in Stark's overprotective and paranoid delusions. Yet, as the conflict unfolds in a more violent way, no side manages to move it past the point of no return, either by incapability or by unwillingness and forgiveness. Which, despite the fact that our superheroes don't shy away from publicly flashing their bruises and black eyes anymore, is a promise of a happy ending one bit too obvious to be compelling.CA:CW is without a doubt an excellent and gripping movie, and letting the second echelon of Avengers participate on par with Captain America and Iron Man was a pleasant refreshment which hopefully will lead to their characters having enough depth in the future. And of course thank you Marvel for introducing the new incarnation of Spider-Man, because even though we saw Tom Holland for just about ten minutes, he is already more natural and appealing as Spidey than Andrew Garfield was throughout both of his films.Yet despite a bit of green in the blue of his eyes, Captain America is still way too flawless, both outlook- and performance-wise. And no millions of dollars in school grants, political approval or traumatized past make Tony Stark's flaws genuinely appealing. So there might be a civil war going on, but when it doesn't induce an inner conflict in yourself, dividing you in half and making you guess which side is the good side, there's only so much engagement such war could provide.",8,1,8,31 August 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Gotta catch 'em all, gotta save 'em all
","Once upon a time, there was a peaceful city of New York, the only place where action ever happens. And it was living its usual mundane life, with self-righteous people fighting the badass people and the badass people fighting back. And they would have been confronting each other happily ever after, but then came a sociophobic British pokemon catcher moonlighting as a WWF volunteer, and it all went haywire...Just as a disclaimer, I'm a total muggle, devoid of any worship for the Harry Potter universe. So all these people who are so powerful, but only as long as they have a phallic symbol in their hands to play with, have absolutely zero effect on me, well, maybe besides cracking me up. Yet I was hoping that maybe the ties of Fantastic Beasts to HP would be loose enough for me to enjoy the story it tells. And while the connection was pretty thin indeed, at least allowing me to understand what's going on without the previous experience of watching the Harry Potter movies or reading the books, the essence of this film was still too weak to my muggle taste.Yes, we're given some sort of conflict. The magically endowed people are in hiding, something like what the mutants were doing in X-Men: First Class. And, just like in First Class, the mere mortals don't really enjoy the perspective of having such potent and unpredictable neighbors. Those who want to retain the status quo are obviously the good guys, but there's this mysterious baddie who rebels against the set order of things and wants the magical world to be reckoned with at last (wonder if he wears a metal helmet too). To make things worse, some chaotic forces wreak havoc on the peaceful city, threatening an already shaky balance.So what's gonna be the last straw that breaks the camel's back? What will be the center of this convoluted story? Maybe a tormented and cast-out creepy young dude played by Ezra Miller, who's been brilliant at portraying such twisted and complex characters since The Perks of Being a Wallflower and We Need to Talk About Kevin? Maybe an unlikely bond between the depressed foster kid and our loner monster lover? Maybe a fragile feeling between a sensitive ginger Brit and a hyperactive American brunette? Nah, forget this petty nonsense. We'll put in the very center of the story a kleptomaniac platypus and a huge whale/hippo in heat. And don't forget a big shiny griffon, because this is what the audience wants to see!Seriously though, Fantastic Beasts suffers from the same illness the whole Harry Potter franchise seems to have been susceptible to from the very beginning. That is, it brings in so many visually fascinating, but substantially hollow things, but when it comes to the real human drama it's awfully shy to develop things or let them at least be fully revealed. The mysterious villain remains a mere rumor until the very end, and even when he's finally exposed you're left to wonder what's so villainous about him at all. The chaotic threat to the very foundations of the world gets disposed of within minutes with no second thought, making you guess what the fuss was about to begin with. And the characters that showed the most promise walk into the sunset without ever unfolding their true potential.In this story full of magic and weird creatures, the only character that stands out is that poor no-maj who just wanted to get a loan in a bank and simply ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. For him, this kaleidoscope of magic flickering and slapstick action is genuinely novel, so the guy is enjoying every second of it. And why shouldn't he? After all, his real life takes action in a canning factory, so a fairy tale dream would make a pleasant distraction. But it's not the dream itself that makes it so precious, its the inherent fleetingness of it which allows you to take only the best into the real world. And while Mr Kowalski had been graced with a gift of oblivion, nobody is gonna erase our own memory. So, when the two hours are over and the credits start rolling, we'll be unfortunate to ask ourselves: true, it's been all cute and easy to digest, but is that really all the film had to offer?",6,1,2,28 February 2017
Ocean's Eleven," More glitter than gold
","You know this type of people whose broad and most sincere smile only means that they have come up with some tricky scheme to screw you over? Well, George Clooney seems to be that kind of a person. Once you see his smug face, you can definitely be sure that whatever you buy that he's selling is gonna be the truest of fake.Now add some serious cast, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts (still in her prime), a convoluted heist plot, and enough reason to dislike the bad guy - and you'll be literally waiting for our A-Team to succeed and cheering when it does. Yes, it does indeed. Did you really doubt that for a second?Ocean's Eleven, released in 2001, still belongs to that (hopefully) gone era of Hollywood cinema when easy was fun and style was enough to substitute substance. And damn, how in style this film goes! All shiny and sparkling, with enough fun little twists and moments of humor, with Clooney and Pitt exchanging impeccable smiles and snappy one-liners, with a sleek kingpin of an antagonist and his dumb nitwit minions - and of course with the charm of Las Vegas and its vibe of easy money and endless entertainment - Ocean's Eleven makes you feel like a spectator at a very expensive and exclusive show.But that era is over, and even the general audience is into trying to dig a film's surface, not necessarily deep but enough to expect a second layer to show itself. And that sort of thing Ocean's Eleven is kinda short of. The big talent is wasted on walking around, looking perfect and sounding confident, while the only character carrying at least some emotional charge is the usual suspect of a good person's ex-wife and a bad person's current love interest. So we can only thank Julia Roberts for being a good actress enough to make those small things count and show a variety of emotions on her face. Because it seems that the rest of the stellar cast only took a single facial expression with them on stage.It is said that a casino is built like a labyrinth to keep visitors in. Huge, loud and blinking, but still a labyrinth. And so does this film, like a race through a maze, try to keep you thinking of anything but its essence. The truth is, the real essence of this movie is not Mr Clooney's smile or the wads of cash he and his friends try to steal. It's that fir-shaped car air freshener that is shown to us for long enough to suspect some bizarre case of product placement. A screamingly strong-smelling piece of unidentified material that doesn't really make the air enjoyable for breathing but instead is only suitable for distracting you from realizing how stale and stuffy it is. Well, you could of course let yourself be fooled for the whole ride, but it's much healthier not to take it at all in the first place.",6,2,3,21 September 2016
Jackie," Not so curious case of one gigantic ego
","Good cinema is not bound to entertain, that's the popcorn movies' lot. Good cinema is, however, bound to fascinate. And not necessarily in a pleasing way. Well, Jackie is definitely not an entertaining movie. But is it at least fascinating? That depends on what you personally expect from the films you watch.If you expect to experience some strong emotions towards the film characters then Jackie will be the right thing for you. Because the one emotion it is definitely capable of drawing is the mix of disgust and bitter pity for the protagonist. Whether or not the film's portrayal of Jacqueline Kennedy is accurate is not for us to judge, and it's not even important because the only Jackie we have a chance to know is the media icon carved in stone of history. What's important, however, is that such icon, no matter how glamorous, is beyond ugly due to the obsession with her own self. Over and over again, this film makes that painfully obvious. If that was the goal then it's been brilliantly achieved.But if you expect a true drama, a story that touches you and keeps you enthralled, this film is probably not the right place to look at. That's the paradox of Jackie, because, despite the profound historical depth of the tragedy of JFK's life and death, this film is about something else. John Kennedy is merely a stage for the main performer, the white swan of the White House. But that star is so busy with trying to impress the world and live up to the image of the First Lady of the greatest president who ever lived, that she fails to notice how false those claims are and how stale she is in that never-ending search of her own perfection.It could've been different. It could've been better if we could see multiple Jackies, one for the public eyes and one more genuine and for the closest ones only. But maybe there never was a genuine Jacqueline Kennedy, and her whole life, day after day, from the morning till the night, was one huge play called 'The First Lady'. If that's true then the film's fault is that it chose an obviously boring person to tell us about. And if it's not so, and there was actually some versatility in that woman, then the film's fault is in a complete failure to grasp it.Either way, we're left with 100 minutes of a painfully slow showcase of one person's endless ego, wrapped in multiple layers of fake self-loathing and real self-adoration. And, of course, the masturbation to the past and its greatness. Because, if the present was shot down half-fledged, without anything to show for itself, but you already have gotten your hopes so high and your pride even higher, it's the past that your only hope for indulgence lies in. And while we know that the life of the true Jacqueline Kennedy was far from over when that glorious play of hers ended, and that she'd have many more years of glamorous life ahead, there's never a hint at that in this movie. Never a hint at a mere hope for a change. And that inherent staleness, no matter how chic and pompous, is the film's true and only taste. Stale and still, like the air in a crypt the past is buried in, the past we might want to honor but don't really want to recall.",6,0,1,1 March 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Unexpectedly good and inexplicably funny
","All i knew about this film prior to watching it is that he has Michael Cera doing the main role. It may mean nothing to some, but those who had seen movies starring Cera before might get a clue or two. And i don't mean it strictly in a good way.Actually, since i first saw Michael in Superbad, he had one stable trait about his characters... they are all the same. Literally. He's always this kinda shy and awkward, nerdy but at the same time sorta streetwise type of guy of undefinable age, the one you wouldn't hate straight away but who you still wouldn't envy even if he got the hottest babe in the show. And if we add his constant grimace of a puppy who just sh@t himself a moment ago and is all sorry about that, i would expect his puppy charms to wear off rather quickly and the frustration to take over.But at the same time, no matter how single-dimensional Michael's characters are, this 'i'm shy and gentle' trick almost never fails to work. It definitely worked in Superbad, where Michael Cera and Jonah Hill duet played some Kyle&Eric sort of magic which, with help of other characters like legendary McLovin, made the film equally fun, deep and touching. In Juno, it was Ellen Page's turn to fill Cartman's place, which she did brilliantly, which also added to the film's overall success.Here, in Scott Pilgrim vs the World, there's no single teammate whom Michael Cera's character of a guy with a complicated approach to relationships could play along. Instead, there's a whole bunch of friends, foes and love interests who swirl around him in a sick (in a good way) mix of garage rock, 8-bit games and comic book extravaganza. Which means, this time Michael has to prove that he can be a single locomotive for the big show.The first 15 minutes of the film weren't too reassuring on this account. They are without a doubt visually creative, and this is probably the first time after Sin City that style does not only overcome substance but becomes a source of it. Yet, the character of Scott Pilgrim itself is what looks like a main drawback. I mean, our guy is still cute and naive, but there's something missing, some driving force that could turn that series of awkward and silly moments into something substantial.And then the miracle happens. Once we finally get to know Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character of a femme who's literally fatale, the story gets a major kick up the butt, and apparently Scott's personality too, because he starts demonstrating will, determination and skills we never got to expect from Michael Cera's fragile and semi-vegetative characters. Can't say this transformation looks very natural, but naturality is the last thing one should expect from a movie that looks more a comic book than a typical cinema.Maybe this visual surrealism is the main defining point of Scott Pilgrim vs the World. Because what might otherwise be somewhat bland and boring transforms into a unique sort of fun, something i never had a chance to experience since Kick-Ass and The Green Hornet, which was years ago for me. The action scenes are equally intense and bizarre, which makes them all the more unpredictable and satisfying.Yet there's more to this film than just the action, visuals and the raw energetics of the whole performance. There's this trademark Canadian approach to life that this movie teems with: from the little comedic episodes, sketches and phrases to the characters to the whole entourage. Not as self-absorbed as the typical American everything, more willing to have a joke on itself, maybe even insecure in some ways, but still with enough soul to incur rather sympathy than abasement. As if the film plays its strengths and weaknesses open but relies on your good will to expect forgiveness rather than judgement.This is the main message this movie sends us by its ending. That whoever we are and whatever we've done, the most important thing is to be able to accept ourselves and those who surround you. Not that big of a philosophical breakthrough, but still satisfying enough to leave a generally pleasant aftertaste. The same could be said about the movie as a whole. Very solid, with both the unique sides and the touching moments. Maybe not breaking enough rules nor touching enough sore spots to really stand out as a film to be remembered across generations. But aiming for that would be too pompous and pretentious, which isn't how they do things in Canada. After all, there's nothing wrong with just good ol' entertainment.",7,1,1,29 July 2015
Avengers: Endgame," A story of a super loss and a super recovery
","Ten years the MCU has been with us, and through all these years I've been watching their films and grading them like a teacher grades homework. Sometimes too harshly maybe. Today I'll be at my most benevolent, so the rating might be somewhat biased.Let's be honest. All the previous MCU movies, except the Captain America ones, were inherently flawed (as Thanos would've said, those flaws were 'inevitable'). Not because of the writing or the visuals, but because of the heroes' nature. Only Steve Rogers was both mature and complete from within, so his story was always solid and compelling on all levels. All the other 'heroes' were more or less kids in powersuits, fighting their own childhood traumas or searching for their purpose. And, as much as I love the coming-of-age movies, a certain annoying goofiness is always their prominent part.But not today. Thanos' Snap didn't just remove a half of the universe's population - it forced everyone to re-evaluate their whole modi operandi. When so many people just... vanish all of a sudden, you just can't stay the same, especially if you feel like it's in a way your fault.And this turn has given us the first hour of this film, maybe the deepest and the most sincere hour in the history of the superhero genre. The post-apocalyptic fright isn't anything new, but this time it's not about the actual survival, but rather trying to accept the new reality, in which, by some lucky coincidence, you were... allowed to live, while some people hadn't been.This, and the whole grandeur of the culmination, are the things that mark out Endgame as a masterpiece of its kind, which deserves to be remembered. The rest is a pretty typical Marvel'esque stuff, lots of pathos and bright CGI effects. Towards the end the movie becomes almost too sentimental, but I guess I would be too, if that universe became my second family for ten years.One more thing. I've been a part of the Team Cap since his first film, and I rooted for his side in Civil War. But this time Steve Rogers and Tony Stark managed to play it together and create a duo that truly shines. I guess when a story that big comes to an end, everyone has a chance to be a hero without overshadowing anyone else.",9,37,58,7 August 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A bland and incoherent mess
","I watched the first movie when it came out on Blu-ray and i remember how thrilled i was. It had all the right things in all the right places. A decent plot that unfolds gradually, keeps you involved and manages to surprise every once in a while. Awesome characters, diverse, with lots of intensity and drama between them, who search for their true selves, question the set order of things, develop and make uneasy choices, sometimes leading to uneasy sacrifices. Not to mention the beautiful animation and great voices. For me, the first movie was definitely the best animated film of that year and one of the greatest i've ever seen. One of the films that can entertain the kids, but also leave a lot to adults so they could thoroughly enjoy them too. Now you can really understand how high the bar was set and what anticipation i had towards the sequel. It had a great older brother to look up to.I don't know what went wrong along the production of the second film, but instead of actually trying to give some of its predecessor's feel (look was more or less delivered) it decided to take a kindergarten road. From the very first scene, where we are shown some silly and over the top fidgety dragon games, it felt like we would be seeing this sort of pointless commotion a lot. Right, because kids like it. But i was totally dumbfounded by this new-found ineptitude, so towards the end of the movie the only excitement left in me was about waiting for it to end.Unfortunately, those who decided that HTTYD2 must be aimed at kids only didn't stop at just filling it with lots of fuss. The characters, even those who showed wits and guts and determination and clear thinking in the first movie, became one-dimensional buffoons. Hiccup's lost-and-now-found mother, who first appears in some Slipknot'esque sort of costume, talks and acts as if twenty years spent away from the people messed up with her sanity somewhat. Stoick is a stubborn moron again, but this time even more like a dimwit with a single tune playing on loop in his head, 'You must be a new chief, a chief does this, a chief does that, you must protect your own, nothing else matters, no, i don't wanna listen to you' kind of thing. Towards the end he's written off, but in such lazy way that you are bound to ask yourself if the screenwriters did that intentionally because he got too annoying and out of his depth. And Hiccup himself... In the first movie, he's a witty but confused underdog who tries to prove himself worthy but has more questions than answers inside, which actually result in a great versatility and lots of emotional moments. This time, we get a self-assured and defiant but terminally naive hippie who's trying to preach 'people want peace, so please stop doing bad things' to the villain. Who, by the way, looks and acts so dumb, growling and swinging his tamer's prod, that you can't help thinking 'How did this stupid brute even manage to take control over the Alpha'. The rest of the cast, including those who mattered in the first movie are hardly more than a mere decoration, a placeholder for a handful of overused gags to fill the pause every now and then.Oh, and the dragons. Lots, lots of them, one more bizarre than the other. But now they are around all the time, constantly brawling, bantering and fooling around, like there's nothing else to do. Even Toothless. While in the first movie we were given much more time of Hiccup and Toothless by themselves so we could see their relationships develop and their personalities unfold, this time around the only thing they seem to be doing is playing games on the ground or having fun gliding in the sky. A great threat-turned-savior diminished to a mere dog with wings and a blaster. So when it's attempted to turn the things around later, it feels nothing but a deus ex machina trick. Even the newest addition to the family, the Alphas, don't bring much refreshment and originality. Once you see them moving and fighting, you just can't help thinking they are all but a ripoff of another type of beasts, starting with 'God' and ending with 'zilla'.Given all the above, and the plot that only the target audience would find satisfying, no wonder that the result is nothing but a plain and emotionless mess. Really, there's absolutely nothing to feel for, because all the problems the characters experience they create themselves, and when they finally fix them you just think 'why couldn't you do that in the first place?!'. And to finish it off, a pumped up, with extra slices of epic, soundtrack that rocks a mighty tune every time somebody so much as farts or, more likely, barfs. Towards the ending credits i really OD'd on that stuff so i had to turn the sound down and kept watching only in case they decided to put some potential sequel teaser after. Thank god they didn't.Some people might claim that the movie's better if you don't compare it to the first one. No it's not. The good remains good, the bad remains bad, no matter from what angles you try to perceive it. The first movie just makes the second one's flaws more obvious, because it gives you a hint at how awesome could be a movie with a given premise. So while the first movie was called 'How to Train Your Dragon', probably, to tell us a thing or two on the matter, the second movie should just have chosen a title more suited for its own message, like 'How to screw up a sequel to a great film'. With that task the creators coped brilliantly, i just hope they won't try to prove their competence in that area again.",4,6,15,19 October 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," Sentimentality for sale
","Let's admit it, people love watching sacrifices made out of love. We just can't get enough of that mushy pathos of the most pointless, irrational and simply plain wrong things being done just because it would lessen the suffering of a single human being (or maybe even a puppy), albeit just for a moment.This is humanity. And, judging by the rating, it is madly in love with Avengers Infinity War. Well, no surprise, since, for the first time in a while, Marvel Studios made a film that dwarfs most of the melodramas ever created in terms of making the soft-hearted people shed a tear or two. The war is waging across the whole galaxy over the topic of sheer survival of myriads of living beings, and our brave heroes, so eager to care none about the collateral damage before, have suddenly become too soft to handle the fact that someone might not make it eventually.And what a time to grow a conscience! Thanos is about, the looming figure from the past Marvel movies, the phantom menace of this cinematic universe, and he's come to strike it big this time. And with him, a huge army of creatures equally ugly and disposable and a few special units he calls his children, finally with a speck of individuality, but still ugly as the rest. Makes you start wondering if those Titan genes are really the best judge of the galaxy's fate.As for 'the good guys', they are quite aplenty too. Maybe even too aplenty to actually have any decent interaction among each other, unless we count some quarrels and a few flashy co-op FPS action scenes interaction. Tom Holland does try to bring his old lively 'friendly neighborhood Spider-Man' attitude, but he's severely outnumbered in this game of big talk and personal issues. Even Steve Rogers, the only guy who was previously known for bringing charisma and integrity into everything he's involved in, is demoted to a mere fighting machine. He's good at that, no doubt about it, but after Winter Soldier and Civil War you expect much, much more from that character. But this time your expectations are your own problem I'm afraid.The rest you have probably seen yourself - and if you haven't then you probably should, because, even with its somewhat generic and one-dimensional taste, Infinity War is still quite good as an action flick. The moving figures won't let you doze off too soon, and a few 'deep' dialogue scenes will keep your palate from getting too numb if you have a taste for anything besides punches and gunshots.Still, after all we've seen from Marvel in these ten years, Infinity War leaves a rather dull aftertaste. Not as pathetic as Iron Man 3, but something between GotG2 and Thor Dark World. In other words, the intense buildup and high expectations make the actual endeavor feel faded. Like all those figures from the ending, this movie doesn't present any substantial endpoint - but rather flakes away, so that instead of feeling absolutely overwhelmed you simply go check on your Instagram updates while the (surprisingly rather impressive) ending credits score keeps banging, find no new posts and feel somewhat disappointed.The film wasn't bad per se. But most of the fan theories and memes people generated while waiting for this to hit the theaters were indeed more exciting. In a way, that does create a balance of sorts, something Thanos would have appreciated, but, as for you, I wouldn't be so sure.",6,2,6,6 August 2018
The Theory of Everything," Life of a scientific celebrity
","The year 2014 has brought us two popular movies dedicated to the lives of prominent scientists - 'The Imitation Game' about Alan Turing and 'The Theory of Everything' about Stephen Hawking. While the impression is still fresh, there's a big temptation to compare them both to each other and look for similarities. Yet, honestly, i could hardly name two seemingly similar films that are as distinct as these two.As i wrote in a separate review for 'The Imitation Game', it generally follows the steps of 'A Beautiful Mind', in a way that the hero is doomed to struggle, and no achievements or scientific success have a chance to bring him peace or happiness. The whole life of Alan Turing is shown as a fight with everything that's around him: bullying fellow students, impatient and short-sighted bosses, hypocritical society etc.On the other hand, in 'The Theory of Everything' we are given a completely opposite picture. The main character, who looks like a hipster male model, receives nothing but praise and love from everyone around him: hot girls swoon at first sight of him, colleagues and mentors only worship him for his bold endeavors with no sign of envy or disgruntlement whatsoever, the society is ecstatic whenever he makes a public appearance, random guys lend a helping hand acting like a non-staff nurse just simply because being near Hawking gives purpose to their lives. Even the queen of England wants to see him.All this is rather cloying. The movie portrays Stephen Hawking as some sort of a superhero prodigy who's the first at everything and is never wrong. It completely obscures the truth of his life, like that several of his bold theories were outright wrong, which he was annoyed to admit, and that his main scientific achievement - the Hawking radiation - still haven't been proved to exist, while the Higgs Boson, the subatomic particle whose existence he denied, was actually found.Just as real-life Stephen Hawking, the movie image of him suffers from the celebrity status. In the movie, his father tells him that he is world-famous. 'For black holes, not for rock concerts', Stephen replies. But still the film makes a rock star out of him, focusing only on the strong sides of his life and completely striking out the rest.The filmmakers might have thought that Hawking's disability is enough of a downside to go with it alone. Indeed, Eddie Redmayne's performance of a man gradually losing control over his own body was brilliant, and there is no doubt that he deserved the Oscar he received for this role. But at the same time i can't help thinking that the way 'The Theory of Everything' portrays the life of a person with ALS is oversweetened and even cynical. There's no doubt about Stephen Hawking's suffering from it. However, he is constantly surrounded by people who view taking care of him as a source of joy rather than a burden, who literally 'worship the ground beneath his wheels'. I'm quite certain that a life of a regular person, neither wealthy nor famous, who suffers from the same illness is infinitely more gritty and dramatic.While 'The Theory of Everything' is a decent and captivating movie, it ultimately fails to go beyond the already existing myth of Stephen Hawking and to show some less glorious sides of his life and personality. And it's just too bad, because, in an ever expanding Universe, a public image of its Master would definitely benefit from some expanding too.",7,0,0,27 March 2015
A Quiet Place," A Stupid Place
","So, you've been feeling too cozy and relaxed lately, and you want a horror/thriller movie to spice up your life a bit? Then look no further, because A Quiet Place will definitely make you experience a solid spike of emotions. However, these might not be emotions you actually expected...I've watched hundreds of movies through all my life, but this film is literally the first one I rage quit halfway through. No, it's not the monsters with extra sensitive hearing that make me mad - it's the stupidity of people who try to survive those monsters and who you're supposed to root for.From the very first scene of the film, where a bunch of kids, including a 4-year old, run around a deserted pharmacy in the not-so-distant post-apocalyptic future, A Quiet Place goes head over heels with bizarre idiocy of the characters, as if to compensate for the lack of its sonic diversity. We can't be scared with the generic spooky music - so let us be constantly strained by the way characters act. Parents not watching over their kids way too young to comprehend the gravity of the situation, kids more grown-up acting as if they don't know what death is and haven't seen it with their own eyes, and both kids and adults behaving as if they were Wet bandits from Home Alone with a death wish for wits.I hoped that the first death (basically shown to us in the trailer) would change something - so that the characters would become less idiotic and more self-aware. But no, the degree of moronity only keeps going higher - as if the only person who's actually interested in surviving this grotesque nightmare is the husband (aka the director). Well, maybe he was the only one who actually read the script, so go figure...My honest guess is that the Hollywood got so engrossed with the cash cow the family values theme is, the movie bosses decided it's enough just to show the adolescent people doing dangerous things to make the audience drool in an overprotective parental ecstasy, willingly closing their eyes on the nonexistence of the plot, incoherence of the characters and a totally emotionally manipulative nature of the whole premise. If there weren't any non-adults involved, most of us would just scoff and approve the stupid deaths of the stupid people (because 'every stupid person dead helps the smart guys remain alive'). Here, however, we're expected to feel involved and worried and sympathetic - simply because there are kids on stage.A hundred years ago, a child exploitation was when infants were forced to work at factories - and the first world countries worked hard to abolish such slavery. Only to end up with this kind of exploitation - maybe less damaging, but definitely no less ugly.",3,2,4,20 January 2019
School of Rock," A goof parade, but with heart
","I guess the concept behind School of Rock's story is old as the hills. A good-hearted but too much of a screw-around loser gets kicked out of his natural habitat and has to pretend to be someone else to get around people who have no prejudice against him. Then he screws around some more, doing antics that make you cringe, until his good-heartedness finally wins you over piece by piece, and then the happy ending ensues. Have fun, feel good, bye-bye!Well, Jack Black has a real talent for turning the 'feel good' into 'feel embarrassed'. A good half of this film, when he's moping around and making idiotic jokes and faces, you really have to battle your instinct to shut your eyes and ears to avoid that horrible shame. Because when it comes to that, one can think of no man more obnoxious and annoying than Mr Black.But, luckily for us, School of Rock is not about our chubby narcissistic doofus. It's about the kids who he teaches while on the mission of impersonating his spineless roommate to earn some easy cash. The kids really steal the show, providing the film with enough character versatility and the real-world child issues. And despite being an abysmal teacher of proper things, Jack Black's infantile character manages to reach out to the kids, gain their trust and wake up the talents which the 'proper' education tries so hard to mould into something useful, convenient but utterly generic. And from then on, the students take over and lead this unlikely alliance to something that ultimately makes this flick enjoyable and even fun.The 'everyone is special, you just need to find your true self' trope gets kinda worn out with time, especially since the real world is not as shiny as it is in the movies, and not everyone is just a vessel of pure talent waiting to be unearthed. But this time, School of Rock managed to nail this theme without getting cloying or force-feeding us that political correctness. And although i would hardly want my kids (if i had any) to be tutored by a lazy bum like Dewey Finn, i'd definitely show them this liberating piece of teen spirit. Because self-confidence is what kids need the most to grow into someone mentally healthy and capable to love and respect himself. And what could be a better source of self-confidence than a sloppy fat guy basking in the self-propagated glory of a rock star, especially if that's what he is really good at.",7,0,0,15 March 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Too contrived and kinda awkward
","When we are done dealing with the actual foes, we start fighting amongst ourselves. This has long been the case with the humankind, and now the superheroes are in for it too.The thing is, while Batman fought Superman just briefly and the fight between Iron Man and Captain America was more like a friendly brawl, the mutants have been confronting each other from the day one, it's not a new ground for the X-Men franchise. So, to advance the story one step further, the screenwriters had to create some new kind of enemy, both entirely abysmal and at the same time integrated into the mutant universum. Enter En Sabah Nur, an ancient mutant superpower determined to wipe the current civilization off the face of the planet.The biggest problem with such diabolical plans of total destruction is 'Okay, let's say you've done it all and turned the world into rubble. What next?'. And that's where it usually starts slipping, because beyond some maniacal delusions of 'the new order' there is barely anything of essence and systematics. For which the main evil genius might be forgiven, since he's always somewhat out of this world, but his disciples, usually much more rooted in the current ways of living - not so much.X-Men: Apocalypse is several notches down from Days of the Future Past not only because it's hardly fun to watch heroes fight a seemingly omnipotent villain whose powers come like trump aces off a sharper's sleeves. But mostly because the motives of the villain's aides, characters much more sympathetic and relatable, are either shallow or muddied. It's one thing to let such a confused and controversial antihero as Magneto be the bad guy, because he'd be bad (and hence good) at being utterly bad, and another to make it a powerful puppet in someone else's soulless hands.But at least Magneto is still moonlighting as his human counterpart, Erik Lehnsherr. And, played by Michael Fassbender, he's one of the pillars of solid, albeit dumbed down at times, drama that upholds this film enough to let it stand till the end. He and James McAvoy, whose low stature is no obstacle for his high acting talents, are the true superpowers that make this film watchable.Unfortunately, that is not equally so with the younger generation of the cast. Jennifer Lawrence, being an inherent vice of the modern cinema, is a tolerable exception, with her only facial expression solemn enough to fit the pathos of the plot. Evan Peters is also good at providing the much-needed comic relief as Quicksilver. But the rest of the kids are one big travesty. Especially the film's attempt to reintroduce Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan as Jean Grey and Cyclops. They are cute and all, but totally lack the gravitas and maturity which were there with Famke Janssen and James Marsden. So when X-Men: Apocalypse makes Jean go full phoenix, it doesn't look grandiose, instead, it much more resembles a little girl trying on her mom's makeup while she's not looking, and defiling in her high heels 10 sizes bigger.And I'm not even talking about that totally awkward Wolverine cameo where the actor generations collide. It's Logan who's supposed to be immortal and forever young. But put a now almost 50 year old man next to a 20 year old girl playing Jean, and no make-up or CGI could steal away that difference. Considering the classic story between those two characters, that face-off wasn't just awkward, it was embarrassing.I don't know where the X-Men franchise is going with all that vibe of rebooting and reincarnation. Right now it seems that Days of the Future Past was the highest point of the new wave. So we can only hope that Bryan Singer is not aiming to cook some sort of The Last Stand of his own.",5,1,5,10 September 2016
Coco," A colorful ode to the Mexican culture and to the family values, but that's kinda it
","If you agree with the 'family comes first' motto, but are tired of it being linked solely to the muscular bald guys and fast cars, then Coco will become a pleasant refreshment for you. A lush and lovingly made animation film based on the Dia de los Muertos theme from the Mexican culture, it is a touching experience and a joy to watch.However, after all the praise Coco received from all around, the actual viewing experience has left me slightly disappointed. Maybe because I did watch The Book of Life, another animation inspired by the Dia de los Muertos lore and featuring the similar 'family wishes vs personal destination' conflict, a film some consider Coco to be a rip-off of. Or maybe it's because, despite all its pretty visuals, cute characters and singing solid enough, Coco clearly doesn't invest too much into having more than a single layer of meaning.You see, here we have a painted prettily and with lots of fizzy buoyant quirks, but still a rather simplistic take on the eternal topic of love's duality and generations' conflict. A kid who loves music, but hatred for it is a family trait for several generations, so he embarks on an unexpected journey through the world of the dead to find a way to unite again what has once been separated and to mend what was once broken. And to sing a few songs and to battle some personal fears while he's at it. There are some nice and emotional scenes along the way, and some lessons learned for some characters, but it's still more or less a linear journey from A to B where good is mostly good (although not without a typical feminine touch of a raging maelstrom of emotionality), and bad is, well, at least clearly selfish from the get-go, and then it's plain outright evil.What is missing in my opinion is the multi-facet delivery, or at least a deeper morals of the story. Sure, 'love your relatives and do what you believe in' is cool, but ain't it what every single animated film is eventually about? And you could reach the ending inevitable for such genre with some more convoluted and morally difficult effort than just being a boisterous music prodigy with tons of luck to his aid.It's not a good idea to criticize art for not meeting your expectations. After all, nobody does it just for you, so why what you think must matter at all? Still, if you are not too fond of stories being rather straightforward, then Coco might feel somewhat shallow. And if you're not a kid who loves everything shiny and moving, then the second half of the film might feel kinda random, slapstick'y and, at times, on seriously heavy drugs (the color-changing monkey burping blue flames or multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya to drink an even more giant cactus' tears being some examples). For you, I might recommend watching The Book of Life instead, which, albeit arguably less glossy and vibrant visually, has a story much more complex and not stamping 'good' and 'evil' labels on things, thus showing the duality of people and of the life itself.For everyone else, go ahead and watch this film. For its loving care for the Mexican traditions, sharing not just the language but also the passion for something outside the typical Western outlook. And clearly for the multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya - that was hilarious beyond all sane measure!",7,57,112,25 February 2018
Sing Street," A feel-good moment for Ireland (and for us all)
","Don't you hate those oversweetened soppy good stories that literally reek of fake? As if the movie creators thought they could really make us buy into all that positive sh!te they just made up without even trying to ground it into something realistic! Well, I certainly do. And it's my pleasure to announce that Sing Street had no single hint of that fake happiness, which makes it a rather unique case of a feel-good film that genuinely feels that way.The story here is simple as hell and revolves around the things all the adolescents dream about: feeling love, finding your true self, breaking free of the confines of the house rules and societal prejudice. But how come Sing Street still feels like a breath of fresh sea breeze in the morning? From a rational standpoint, it's a mystery.Mr Freud, whose face we could glimpse on several occasions in the film itself, might have an answer though. Feel-good movies don't feel too good because they are about people we (okay, most of us) actually failed to become. Failed to find that true love, or pursue our true destiny, failed to become what we've been dreaming to become. And seeing an artificially crafted cinema figure reach for its stars is less motivating as it's depressing.But this time we don't have to choose between a starry path charted for and by someone else and our own less stellar reality. This time we've gotten our alter ego right there. A stoner, a school dropout, formally a typical loser... but who still gets some love from the movie, and for whom someone else's pursuit of a dream is not a source of jealousy but rather a moment of redemption and liberation, however small or past due. And for those who are already too expired to put their hopes into following Conor's path, Brendan is an alternative still positive enough to make us all smile, and this time actually feeling that it's a sincere smile.My only complaint about this film is that, by making all the main characters so dashing and daring, it made them way too unrealistic. Ireland might be a birthplace for a lot of famous musicians, but passing the lyrics written by six(!) grown-up men for a 15 year-old's work is just way over the top. Being so fiercely brave and witty, both with enemies and love interests, and looking so shamelessly dazzling is what every kid has wet dreams of, but nobody ever had for real. So if the Sing Street members had been just several years older, it would've been much more natural. But, then again, the movie wouldn't have had that break-away vibe it bases itself on...But these are the things we sacrifice for the greater good. And, at the end of the day, Sing Street is good because it made us believe in something for a moment. That no matter if you live your life in Ireland or in some other depressing sh!thole, no matter if you took an arrow in the knee or if the world's trying to screw you over right now, the steering wheel to your future is still in your hands. So ride it like you stole it! PS: the kids playing the band members are just unreal! I can't believe almost all of them don't even have an IMDb profile pic. And Mark McKenna who played Eamon... Dude, you're like Shia LaBeouf all over again, but without that Transformers stain he still can't wash off. Keep going like you do and you're golden!",8,1,2,14 January 2017
Big Hero 6," An Oscar-winning boy's wet dream
","I guess there should be a rule that forbids people to review movies out of personal spite and rage. But, luckily for me, there's no such rule, and nothing will stop me from saying everything that i think 'Big Hero 6' deserves, just like nothing stopped it from brain-raping me earlier.Where to begin... Honestly, i wanted to enjoy this film. I had almost no idea what it was about, so i thought that maybe there was a reason why it got that Oscar and my beloved 'Lego Movie', 'the shallow self-endorsing postmodernist junk' as they called it, wasn't even nominated. I held no personal grudge, even though i read those interviews with the Academy people who vote for the best animation, in which they admit that they select the picture based on what their kids liked the most. I threw it all aside, wanting and expecting to receive something fresh, something that would really stand out and prove that it deserves all that praise it received.Well, i guess the year 2014 simply wasn't destined to make my animation-related dreams come true. First they botched the 'How to Train Your Dragon' franchise, and now this...You know, my girlfriend has a nephew, a 10 year old kid. This little fellow simply adores the comic book movies. First his favorite hero was Spider-man. He had a Spider-man costume, all the possible Spider-man toys, even a Spider-man shampoo. Then at some point he kinda switched to Iron Man, and now that dude seems to be his favorite. Well, don't know who he switches to next, but what i do know is that he could've easily written this movie's script by simply writing down any of his dreams.Seriously, everything in 'Big Hero 6' is secondary, as if all the most popular animation and comic book movies blended together in one glossy banging mess. An awkward harmless robot with a bit of a WALL-E in it (the best part), who later becomes a puffy martial artist like Kung-Fu Panda, then gets seriously upgraded like Iron Man, while our main character, with only his aunt to look after him, kinda like in Spider-man, keeps inventing stuff like that dude from Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, learns to fly the robot like that dude from How To Train Your Dragon, while his posse gets all powered up like Fantastic 4, and all this to oppose the evil masked guy who mentally controls matter like 'that dude' from X-Men. And did i mention that one of the posse members has those plasma blades like the Protoss infantry units from Starcraft?.. Ugh, i wanna vomit already, can anyone give me a plastic bag? Preferably 100% recycled, to perfectly match this movie.In Russian, when we wanna say that someone's joke is old, we call it 'beardy'. Beardy is how one could call this movie's attempt to make passing gases look funny. But when the gas passing moments are the only jokes you have to offer, it's even worse. In such cases we could say 'if you shaved your joke, you could slide it under the door'. You know what i mean.So, if we shave all the action boom-boom stuff from 'Big Hero 6', it falls (un)surprisingly flat. The main character, Hiro, living in some weird fusion of two coolest cities of US and Japan, is a troublesome little prodigy who's so brilliant that he creates a groundbreaking piece of technology in his garage as if it was some school science fair project, yet he fails to see the most obvious logical connections between the events that happen afterwards. His posse, a group of so called geniuses, who are in fact just zero-dimensional muppets with only a single trait of character and who never go beyond that prescribed agenda. The villain, the biggest collection of clichés one could come up with, almost forcedly placed in the right place and at the right time to create something remotely resembling a conflict. And all this - to deliver what message exactly? That friends = good, killing people = bad, even when people = bad too? Give me a break!Some say that all this stuff is forgivable because 'Big Hero 6' is a kid's movie. Well, kids can love it all they want, i don't care. Because kids also like ripping wings off flies and burning ants with a magnifying glass, and it doesn't make those activities any cooler. So i really hope that at some point in the future (hopefully sooner than later, but i'm not too optimistic about it) the animation business bosses wake up and realize how full of sh!t they have become making all that cheap generic stuff nobody will care about once it stops moving and screaming. And if that really happens - i only wish they feel shame, for putting monetary gain over the artistic value, bangs over substance and for diminishing animation to its technical core - just a sequence of moving frames. Because that's what 'Big Hero 6' really is. Just a mindless, senseless, soulless sequence of frames.",3,28,83,18 April 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Style over substance - space edition
","Right after his mother dies of cancer, a little boy is abducted by an alien spacecraft. And so begins the story of Peter Quill, or Star-Lord, who will travel to unimaginable places, will find the most unlikely friends in the most unlikely situations and will save the galaxy from the ruthless space maniac along the way.The humankind has always had a soft spot for the adventure movies. The far-and-away lands, hidden treasures, exotic beauties, deadly perils and of course the fearless heroes - what could be more fun to watch on screen? Add 'space' to it - with multiple planets, crazy spaceships, bizarre alien creatures and literally limitless freedom - and the audience will simply be lying in orgasmic convulsions asking for more. It's actually funny that two of the most iconic and cult adventure franchises of the last 40 years, Indiana Jones and Star Wars, are created by the same person, and that Indy and his space cowboy twin brother Han Solo are portrayed by the same person. Now that duo probably knows everything that there is to know about the genre.Guardians of the Galaxy is probably the first movie i've seen that delivers that feeling of a space rodeo, something we first experienced thanks to the original Star Wars trilogy. And that really is something to value if you are into this sort of things. The locations, characters and names change with a speed of antelope stampede, plot twists and turns like a giant python around its victim, and the only good thing you can do to yourself is to stop trying to rationalize what you see and just enjoy the show. Pew-pew, ka-boom, yeehaw!Unfortunately, if you are older than 10 years, don't have ADHD or just have a brain that's not easily switched off, you'll notice, to some degree of regret, that the abundance of style this movie boasts covers a serious shortage of an actual substance. The whole idea of a mighty artifact being sought after by some of the baddest and meanest of the guys in the galaxy, only to be found by a small-time treasure hunter who doesn't even know what it is, just makes no sense. Exactly like the motives of the other characters, who switch from 'shoot first, ask questions later' to 'best buddies ever' in a split-second. The biggest and the most plot-important things happen mostly due to luck, stupidity, recklessness or a combination of those, as if you're simply not allowed to think straight in this world. For instance, two planets just signed an important peace treaty - but their leaders clearly don't give a damn about being friendly and respectful to each other, as if they are old buddies who can f**k with each other verbally with no consequence. And one of those leaders is an evil woman from 101 Dalmatians. Yeah, sure, give me a break.Treating GotG seriously would only inflict brain damage on you, so i can hardly analyze this movie as a whole. Probably, it doesn't even want to be treated that way. Instead of trying to give a solid impression, it breaks itself into a multitude of small episodes where the little things like a dude dancing around an abandoned planet listening to a cassette player and kicking alien lizards, a ship flying over some space station with the 80's pop hit playing on background, or a walking tree that probably escaped from the Lord of the Rings production pretending to be Eywa and launching some luminous spores, can do the trick.In these little moments and the crude but harmless banter that usually accompanies them lies the true power of this movie. The bad thing is that besides them, and some pretty decent CGI, GotG can hardly offer you anything else. The good thing is, it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it. So if this space adventure is your kind of game, do hop in!",7,3,6,16 November 2014
The Imitation Game," A Homosexual Mind
","A WWII influenced atmosphere. Protagonist, a young mathematical genius, sociopathic and emotionally restrained. Great promise and struggle with underachievement. A popular and charismatic rival who later becomes a friend. A woman who starts as a follower but later moves to the center of the protagonist's attention. A major revelation thanks to flirting with girls in a bar. A final breakthrough and the major success. Turn to the worse, the dark times and the dark secrets. Loneliness and impotence, with the only friend living inside your head. Acceptance of own fate. And finally a widespread recognition and a legacy that's hard to overestimate.It's funny how similar the stories can sometimes be. Is it because the filmmakers simply want to use the same instruments? Or because the people on whose lives those movies are based, brilliant but controversial, are bound by their fate to pass through such hardships to fulfil their destiny and find regard for their achievements? One can hardly tell. And maybe we shouldn't even dig deep into it, leaving it stay as a magic of the cinematographic art.As for 'The Imitation Game' itself, it is a very solid movie, gritty and dramatic, just as a life of Alan Turing itself, whose work made a huge influence on the course of the World War II, helping save millions of lives, but who ended up prosecuted in his own country for something that is now considered, if not a norm then, at least, a matter of one's private business. And while it may sometimes feel that the movies covering the WWII period are too aplenty already and that the filmmakers should move on and look for some fresher and more burning topics, films like 'The Imitation Game' allow us to see a whole epoch via the eyes of a single man, feel not only the world as it was but also what it was for real people to be a part of it, to live in it.But despite having an Oscar-winning screenplay, this film would not be what it is without the people who act it out. Benedict Cumberbatch may be hugely overrated and overpraised, but here he proved to have enough spirit, emotional charge and diversity to be really considered a great actor. Keira Knightley deserves the similar regard for portraying her character, but one has already come to expect that ability to make a teeth-clenching delivery of characters of any complexity from her. And although you can clearly see that she's not a young girl anymore, it seems that maturity only enriches her acting talents.Maybe 'The Imitation Game' is not an all-time masterpiece for which the last year would be remembered, but it's still pretty much worth watching. Even though it's about mathematicians, it's not school-boring, and after watching it you might even find more value in the everyday things that surround you, like having no government control over your intimate life or having digital gadgets that do not occupy a whole room or take forever to load a web page or play back a song.",8,5,7,11 March 2015
Silence," God and humanity: Scorsese at his deepest
","I had quite distorted expectations towards this film. One review I scarcely read called it a 'sado-maso flick with priests'. And, considering Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield's sleazy mugs, I was almost expecting some perverse variation of 50 Shades of you know what. Well, truth be told, I have never been so wrong in my life.Silence is a story of two Jesuit priests from Portugal, who go to Christianity-intolerant XVII century Japan to discover the fate of their mentor. That's basically all the story on the surface. Beneath it, though, it's a journey much more profound and mind-provoking. A journey that, depending on how deep you're able to analyze the topic, might make you ponder whether religion is a virus that cares solely about spreading, whether the only thing multiple religions produce is people's suffering, whether your high spiritual beliefs and principles are worth letting people die, whether faith really needs the tangible symbolics, and whether god actually cares about people, or the only thing he cares about is being worshiped properly. And that's just the obvious philosophical and theological concepts Silence reaches for, and if you wanna look harder you might find even more food for thought here.Seriously, this is not a film you would wanna watch in a movie theater. Besides two and a half hours of its running time, I spent at least another hour for just pausing and debating over what's going on and what do those actions imply with the person next to me, sometimes digressing from the film's context towards the universal concepts of humanity and civilization evolution. And that rich ground for discussion, something way beyond the scope of a mere review, is probably the most impressive of Silence's achievements.Still, this film is not just its story, which is primarily a merit of the book the film is based on. It's the way that story is told. And I don't know what kind of cinema magic Scorsese put in here, but he has managed to do an almost undoable job: make the film clearly speak to you between the lines, conveying the most complex and confusing and even intimidating topics and concepts without saying much out loud. The silence that finally revealed to Rodrigues the voice of God is probably the same silence in which we can hear everything that this film has to say, and more. It may sound silly or trivial, but trust me: it's no small feat to raise topics of such magnitude - and make them obviously relevant to our turbulent world of today where people kill and die in the name of various gods every day - without being cryptic like Umberto Eco or pop and glossy like Dan Brown. My only complaint about Silence is its ending, opting out of the open interpretation and thus losing the precious ambiguity and at the same time the philosophical potential of such, but otherwise what Mr Scorsese did out here is nothing short of divine, whether you believe in god or not.",9,0,1,17 March 2017
La La Land," Takes your heart out to play it like a piano, and does that just right
","In a sense, creating perfect films and perfect relationships is a similar task. You just start with the best, and then simply keep it up, never compromising, not a single mistake, not a single wrong step. In a sense, it's a technical task: follow these rules - and you are bound to succeed.However, simply perfect is just too simple. Too plain. When you come to expect the perfection, you start taking it for granted, and even the perfect things lose their shine and become kinda dull. But how to create something perfect if perfect itself won't cut it? The answer is: you just have to wing it, turning your heart into an antenna and listening to what it's telling you.La La Land does just that. And, technically, what it does isn't perfect at all. The opening scene is way too cheesy and orchestrated, the dissonance between the people and their song is tiny, but stingingly apparent. And you're already bracing yourself for another hyper-hyped ultra-colored hymn to itself. At that point, the film's all but a future disappointment.But the perfect relationships are not a sunny day on a loop - what's more important is being able to make it up for the flaws and turn them into the details you'll eventually love as well. So, after having overplayed the bravado at first, the film becomes softer and more delicate, not miming its song, however perfectly, but finding its own voice, honest and sincere. A voice in which Mia and Sebastian speak to each other. At moments gruff, at moments insecure - but ultimately telling the most true story there is.Right here is where most other participants take the smooth road to an inevitable happy ending. And the summer in La La Land is sweet and promising enough to deliver just that. But will the technically perfect thing be really perfect? Or even a sunny day could get pale if not the clouds and rain to be its counterpart? So the summer is bound to turn into fall, and, once inevitable, the prospect of a happy ending vanishes like a sad pipe smoker's dream.But that's when we're hooked with no way back. From that point on, we want to listen to the story, no second thoughts, no distractions, there's only us and the storyteller. Like children who stopped squabbling and all want to know if the prince eventually finds his fair lady. Our emotions are already at stake, and the elegance with which La La Land took them out of our pocket is almost illegal. The thief doesn't even conceal himself, playing our hearts openly, and it's tempting to stop playing along and call the police. After all, the emotional manipulation is indeed a crime, even when it's so sublimely carried out.Well, if you still had strength to resist, the last shreds of it fall when Ms Stone takes the lead. And it's not just her ability to act or sing, which was out of question a long time ago. It's how she takes the razor sharp blade of emotions concealed within the script, and pulls it out in one impeccable move, like King Arthur once did. And oh boy, don't you just start shivering at that moment, so bright she shines.And just after that, it becomes really inevitable. The mastermind of this brilliant spectacle, Mr Chazelle, might be young, but when he's behind the wheel of a story he wrote himself, he doesn't miss. Every single romantic nonsense that we used to laugh about - like 'and she felt as if those five years have never passed, as if she was right there, in that quiet restaurant at Christmas eve, her eyes on him, as if nothing else existed' - becomes alive in his hands, and he literally takes us on a journey others could only describe. The feeling you experience at that moment... it's pure magic, something that not only makes you forgive the pompous intro, but makes you realize that it was the only right start for something that led you where you are now. And that's when your feeling is finally complete.Technically, La La Land isn't without a flaw. And if I was a grumpy old fart, I might've groaned on about it for a bit. About Ryan Gosling's questionable singing, or the plot's lack of complexity, or the ending being not what we might want it to be. But that doesn't really matter, after all, it's just technicalities. What does matter is what the film emanates - love. Love for art, love for those who dare to dream and dare to follow the dreams, who dare to be open and true. Love for life itself. The kind of love that shows the passion of the person whose heart that love flows out of. And these feelings don't just show off or simply graze you. They reach out to you. They ARE THERE for you.And for letting me take that love as my own, La La Land, thank you.",10,5,10,16 April 2017
How to Train Your Dragon," A truly magical ride
","There's no fun writing good reviews about movies that are commonly seen as good, or the other way around. It feels pointless, like repeating the obvious. But sometimes people seem to be mesmerized by the look-alikes and simply forget what it is to deal with something truly original and precious. So when i first saw How to Train Your Dragon back in 2011, i didn't find it necessary to say anything: anyone with eyes and ears would've understood everything without help from aside. Or so i thought. But after the excitement and praise the HTTYD's sequel received in 2014, with some even claiming that it surpassed its predecessor, it got obvious that eyes and ears are not enough: only with your mind and heart open you can feel the movie's 'soul' if it has it, or notice its absence if it doesn'tSome details of the original movie might've faded in memory with time. But a single re-watch made them all vivid again. And, the most important thing, brought back that magical feeling that made me instantly fall in love with this movie back in the day. As if you are transferred from the cozy modern environment to a world full of scary and dangerous things and creatures, and the only thing that could compare with that fear of unknown is the curiosity and eagerness to finally find out the secrets it contains.But HTTYD is more than just about exploring the unknown that's around you. It's also about the search of your own true self, about questioning the stereotypes based on fear and, above all, about kindness and compassion, and how such things can actually change the set order of things.The protagonist named Hiccup, is a nerdy and tiny son of the gigantic and brutal chief of the Viking tribe, people who may pray the Norse gods but whose true god is strength and toughness. Being a total failure in his people's eyes, he desperately tries to prove himself worthy and to kill a dragon, only to find out, when he finally gets a chance to, that his heart goes against it. And so begins a story of a person who, in the world where people are taught to kill first and ask questions later and nobody bothers to think whether it's right or wrong, decides to take a different path. Which leads to things like accepting who you really are, standing up for it and finally making a difference. And finding things that you were so desperate to find, like love and approval, along the way.In the world ruled by the machismo stereotypes, it's especially refreshing to see movies where silly and clumsy characters who, on the other side, have a soft and kind heart, may actually save the day and even be sexy. The same approach worked brilliantly in another Dreamwork's gem, Kung-Fu Panda.But the magical spell would not be complete without amazing visuals and a truly beautiful score. Seriously, unlike the sequel's soundtrack that was borderline annoying, so excessively vigorous it was sometimes, in HTTYD we have a great mix of a whole variety of themes, from suspenseful to gentle to cheerful to really epic and fist-clenching, each of them perfectly complementing the actions we see on screen. And the scenes of Hiccup and Toothless just flying in the sky, free from everything that confined them on the ground... That was just an indescribable experience that only HTTYD and Avatar ever managed to deliver. As if you're up in the sky yourself, gliding through the clouds with no care in the world...Alas, all the fairy-tales are bound to end sooner or later, and this movie was no exception. Still, i'm utterly grateful to the team behind HTTYD for creating something that, even for an hour and a half, turns you into a child again and lets you feel the magic long gone from our own reality.",10,1,2,22 October 2014
Rocky," A triumph of self-pitying losers
","I'm well aware of the story behind the creation of Rocky, especially the fact that Stallone had a very hard time to draw the studios' attention to the screenplay which was his vision of a chance to get out of the obscurity his career and himself were in at that time. So if we were to look at Rocky as a defining moment for the Stallone's star then yeah, it's a pretty important film. However, i don't think that a film's merits should be defined by whose career it helped boost. And, as a separate cinematographic product, Rocky is not just undeserving to be among the best films of all times, it's plain average.The whole fiber of the film oozes hopelessness and despair. And maybe Philadelphia of the 70's was indeed a grim place to live in. But the main reason for setting up a story in such a depressing environment is to allude the life of Rocky Balboa and those surrounding him to some kind of a Cinderella story and make us root for the underdog. And it might have even worked if Rocky was even slightly intriguing and charismatic.Instead, Stallone's script does its best to avert the audience from Rocky. The first half of the film is basically a showcase of what a bum (if not a true imbecile) Rocky is. Unable to talk like a human being, instead mumbling some deranged nonsense, Rocky is more like Frankenstein than Cinderella, roaming around the murky streets of the Philadelphia slums, devoid of any idea how to live his life today or what to do with it tomorrow. The only way to make him look less of a creep was to give him pet turtles and an affection for an equally socially and emotionally disabled woman working in a store nearby, which might be sentimental enough to work for some, but feels unbelievably forced and corny to me.But for the Cinderella story to work, Rocky had to receive an invitation to a ball. A title boxing fight in his case. Which happens late enough to get bored by Balboa's constant downer's attitude (how's that for an example: 'You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what I mean? It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.'). But, luckily, still early enough to give the film some room to capitalize on that change. Because when Rocky finally shuts it and starts doing something useful, he becomes watchable at last. Even inspiring for some.The end of this fairy tale is as predictable as it's gracious for the protagonist. It's by no means realistic, but i guess Stallone just didn't have enough star fever to write a better ending for his character. Still, the fact that the film ends rather abruptly is probably a sign that the author had no idea what to do next other than to call a woman to the rescue. Unfortunately, the impression that the whole film leaves is exactly the same: unaware of its goals, hardly knowing what to do, simply trying to go the distance because... well, because there's no much choice otherwise. Apparently, the audience loved that blind weary spirit back in the day, but now it looks like the success of Rocky and the career of Stallone itself were nothing but freak luck.",6,1,3,1 April 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Bells and whistles and family values
","When a movie has a single major flaw, writing a review is easy: just be sarcastic and keep hitting the same spot from different angles. But when a film, despite its gigantic proportions, is flawed on so many levels, you're often at a loss to choose which flaws to pursue. GotG2 is the perfect example of the latter case. So where do I begin?The first thing that comes to mind is that, unlike the first GotG film, the sequel has lost the ability to get its act together. Sure, the first Guardians of the Galaxy was far from being a 'serious' superhero movie (maybe because having Iron Man and Captain America battle each other is serious enough for the Marvel universe), but at least it could, when the circumstances demanded, be mature and even touching, the 'we are Groot' moment being a perfect example. That contrast deepens the experience, making you care about what's going on ever so more.This film, however, feels as if, with Groot reduced to a twig childhood state, the same happened to the brains of the other characters: now they are constantly risking the lives of their own and their friends' simply to pester their sense of masculinity or for the sake of unhealthy banter, only to end up with some turd jokes. There are a few glimpses of maturity here and there, but when yet another film with Kurt Russell and Vin Diesel tries to build all its pathos upon the 'we're family' line, it becomes just too much to handle.Another thing that strikes you about GotG2 is how all over the place it is. The Marvel universe is seriously lacking villains right now. And if the Avengers can afford to simply fight each other in the absence of a better thing to do, the Guardians have to be supplied with a multitude of strangely generic or single-use baddies, especially since the family values doctrine demands some old baddies to become goodies. The vindictive golden lady might have been mildly amusing if her plot line was put in here for jokes only, but the ending credits scene shows otherwise, so it's not even funny anymore. And the figure of Peter's father, despite all its technical grandiosity, ends up kinda hollow inside (in all senses). So even when the good (or should we say infantile and aggravating?) prevails, there's no true satisfaction in it.Finally, there's this weird glossy neon atmosphere all around this film. Everything is polished and sparkling and blinking with a million different colors. In that sense, GotG2 definitely takes after Doctor Strange: both films, despite all their potential, look like some generic Japanese/Korean action RPG game: too fast-paced, too jerky and, most of the time, too meaningless. Maybe the overabundance of shiny objects and slapstick jokes was meant to hide that lack of essence the films fail to admit.All in all, I take GotG2 as a sign of geriatric dementia for the whole Marvel universe. True, the style and the looks are still there, but when it comes to charting course forward, there seem to be no true aim ahead, and, most importantly, no true understanding of why such aim should exist in the first place. This makes the Guardians franchise not just the 'style over substance' type, but simply pointless.",4,2,6,13 August 2017
The Shape of Water," Of monsters and men
","It's the space race and Cold War crazed 60's again, with America being at its finest: gloomy underground facilities, 'mission above humanity' ethics and slightly covered racist undertones. And huge glorious metal beasts on four wheels of course.And among those cold monstrosities live regular people, some big and self-important, some little, alone and confused. Elisa Esposito is a shy mute janitor girl working in some secret lab, whose life is a repetitive chore with the only refreshment being her dreams of something bigger and brighter, something we can only guess about from her gestures and the words of two people who understand her - a black co-worker and a older sexually confused painter with whom she shares a shabby but stylish apartment above a cinema.What comes next may be viewed as yet another take on the 'beauty and the beast' story, this time told mostly without words and taking place inside a dark rusty bunker instead of a palace. But it's more than just love between a woman who feels out of place around her own kind and a creature taken from its natural habitat. It's a story about all the rejects of this world who don't know where they belong or, even if they do, hardly receive any acceptance in return. About those who dare to dream, to stay true to themselves and to do what they believe in, even if the risk is high and the consequences may be severe.In fact, this whole film feels like Guillermo del Toro's profession of love towards all those bizarre worlds filled with bizarre creatures that he's been creating for as long as we know him. The amphibian creature from The Shape of Water may not be directly connected to Abe Sapien from Hellboy, but it does feel like a homage to del Toro's roots, and to the gentle and sensitive side we rarely get to see in the monstrously looking things.This film is much more sentimental than you could expect from a movie with Michael Shannon playing a violent creep with two zombie fingers sewn to his hand. So sentimental that one could suspect del Toro was putting some personal reflections on his life into it. Yet, just like the creatures his imagination brought to life aren't a pleasant view for some, so is the subtle mix of erotic fantasies and yearning for a kind touch displayed through bodily movements and pantomime not a fail-proof key to everyone's hearts. I, for one, can easily admire the creative brilliance of the entourage and its aesthetics, but when it comes to letting the main characters inside your own head and seeing the world through their eyes, The Shape of Water is as effective and eloquent as talking to a fish. I guess the 60% of my body that is water is not in shape enough for this trick to fully work.",7,2,4,1 March 2018
American Made," The Wolf of Mena, Arkansas
","A story about a con artist having the time of his life, tons of money, hot wife and all, till the payback time came. Oh yeah? That's too innovative to be true!But even if Martin Scorsese haven't made his masterpiece four years ago, American Made would still not feel great. This typical story of a smug guy getting his hands dirty, just a bit at first, and, little by little, he's shoulder deep in some complex mess and has a hard time hiding cash in suitcases - it feels so overused that even the custom set of plot zigzags or the quirky little scenes don't transform it into anything you'd really wanna pay attention to.It's hardly Tom Cruise's fault - after all, he's doing what he's always been doing, that is, smiling wide, talking smooth and emanating confidence. Neither it's the fault of any other cast member. Especially Caleb Landry Jones: this guy seems to be everywhere hot this season. And even if this movie will definitely not become the peak of his thespian career, the likes of Get Out and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are an alibi enough.Maybe we should simply admit that this film was never supposed to be anything great. Just a generic crime adventure with an already infamous 'based on real events' stamp. To be great wasn't even the goal - to avoid being a failure was (mostly a box office one). But fear not: the sufficient amount of properties of a consumable product is here. Will it taste good? Probably not really. But who cares about taste as long as you don't make a scene and don't ask for a refund. Nothing personal, just business. That's what being American made is about after all, isn't it?",6,1,2,23 February 2018
Steve Jobs," A good movie about a bad person
","It's quite difficult to expect to be amazed by a movie about a person you don't really like, who founded a company you're not a fan of, which produces gadgets you've never bought and will never buy. Especially since there was a movie about the same guy and the same company just a year ago. Which had a guy who looked so much more like the real-life Steve Jobs but still didn't pull it off for me.Well, sometimes the expectations are to be exceeded. And what 'Jobs' failed to achieve, 'Steve Jobs' - by some uncanny magic or a dirty marketing trick - kinda managed to accomplish. It managed to show us the history of Apple and the key people behind it as a story of real people, not just look-alike moving and talking puppets. It managed to create drama which you don't just observe but instead feel to the marrow of your bones. And - despite being a movie about one big egotistical megalomaniac piece of sh!t of a person - it turned out to be a movie which you actually wanna like and end up doing so.Michael Fassbender did one amazing and pretty impressive thing playing Steve Jobs for this flick. He actually proved that you don't have to look like a historical person to succeed at conveying him or her. Quite the contrary, it's the fact that they didn't even try to mess up with Fassbender's appearance to make him look more like Jobs that sold me on this one. Because it basically shows that you may look like anyone or anything, even like a giant talking papier-mache head, but if you truly live into your character then the audience would also believe it and after some time it would not even matter how you look. Although, and i have to admit this, by the time the movie reaches its apogee, Fassbender starts kinda resembling (in the physical sense) the person he was called in to portray. Not that it's a bad thing in the first place.Another thing 'Steve Jobs' did right is by almost completely avoiding the bureaucracy of the business making. All these board meetings, corporate intrigues, 'which department gets more financing' kind of stuff - all scratched out to make more room for what really makes this film stand out: the human side of every business. We finally get to see that it's not just Jobs who has any substantial personality, that both Wozniak and Sculley were deep and consistent and actually sympathetic people, and that even some engineer guys may have enough soul and guts to be given the screen time. Which only proves one big message most Apple fanboys don't wanna see: Apple is not just success, and Apple's success is not just Steve Jobs.The two hours of this film didn't tell me much new about Apple or its products, and they certainly didn't depict Jobs as a person less unpleasant as i've come to imagine him to be. Still, those two hours were not wasted in vain, because no matter if you love Apple or his infamous co-founder or not, it's a company that did a lot to make the world of today what it is, and the people behind it deserve the tribute this film paid to them, even if some self-endorsing glorification couldn't have been avoided. At least it did mention some right things, showed some right choices being made and some true effort to be acknowledged. And if you need some photo flashes and an upbeat Google Zeitgeist-like hipster music to keep you on the edge of your seat and fully immersed - then why the hell not?",9,1,2,24 February 2016
Joker," Sad people's comedy
","A frustrated but relatively harmless guy gets pushed over a little too much and goes on a sick rampage. This is a story I've seen several times, the first one I remember being Falling Down, that 1993 movie with Michael Douglas. There were definitely some more, I just can't recall them, because the plot of such films always goes through the same steps, you just can't tell the stories apart.I've heard so much praise for Joker, I expected something groundbreaking. Instead what we have here is one stellar individual performance in front of an otherwise dull and intentionally grisly landscape. An unsettled city full of unsolved social issues, cynical politicians saying things as if to fire up the situation on purpose. Violent kids on the street, white-collar jerks, everything around created specifically to depress the viewer.Sometimes it does feel as if DC simply doesn't want its fans to have a single bright thought or a light emotion. It's a universe full of sad and uptight characters delivering to an army of equally sad people. At least before it was about one emotionally scarred individual putting on a mask and putting on a tour de force against the 'bad guys'. It was dark, but the action tried to make up for it. This time, however, there's almost no action - and you are just taken on a journey of the main character to join him in wallowing in all his personal darkness and drama.Joaquin Phoenix is no doubt exceptional here, his performance is worth all the accolade it received. Besides that, though, Joker is simply too one-dimensional to be touching. When you paint everything black too many times, all the next layers of paint just don't make any difference, and even a clown's garish garb can't bring in enough color to make up for it. Joker is a beautifully messed up character, but he's nowhere close to Tonya Harding, another fantastic performance that was not given half the credit it deserves. Joker's craziness is predefined by his grotesquely gloomy surroundings, while Tonya's fate was a real life story of this very world. Makes one guess whether we can really sympathize with issues we classify as our own.Despite a truly fiery (in all senses) ending, Joker the movie fails to ignite a spark of prolonged interest. If not for the crazy praise this film has received, one might not even feel pressed to share their thoughts on this film with others, turning the watch into a cinematographic one-night stand. Tomorrow, I will probably not be ashamed of what I did tonight. But is this experience simply forgettable without a hint of a lasting trace? Totally so. If people will be thinking about 2019, Baby Yoda is what they'll probably recall first, and that speaks volumes about this film's quality.",7,2,3,11 April 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Technically, the most compelling Kong of 'em all
","Yes, the review title may sound ridiculous, especially if you're one of those people who hate remakes. And I agree, it's kinda crazy that the story of a gigantic ape now got its fourth installment. But if you rise above the prejudice, you will see that there's more to this film than just a monetary incentive.Over the years, I happened to watch all the King Kong films (not the sequels, just the story openers), including the 1933 classic. And while their plot is generally the same, it's the accents that make the difference and show what the films were about in each particular epoch. The first film was basically a wow-inducing breakthrough with a social undertone (showing a giant ape in chains for the white crowd's amusement might ring some bells in 30's America). The film from the 70's was much more of a melodramatic tear-jerker. And what Peter Jackson did, apart from actually remaking some of the original scenes like a fight with a T-Rex, was ultimately devoid of a substantial core of any kind, so the only thing I do remember from that film is Jack Black's character's ridiculous ending line said with a totally unfitting pathos.But the progress moves on, and even the old tropes acquire additional depth the audience has come to expect from films no matter what the genre they belong to (unless the genre is the CGI metal porn directed by Michael Bay). And this Kong, compared to the previous films, tries its best not to be shallow.We've been given the characters with reasonable agendas, ones that might seem insane per se but are quite believable in this particular setting. We've got the story progression that gradually shifts our view of Kong from a bloodthirsty killing machine to something worth feeling sympathy for. And all that is done without emotional manipulation of any sort - and that thing alone earns Kong: Skull Island my respect.But the best thing of this film is that, unlike what others say and what I've been kinda expecting myself, it doesn't just spray acting talent around hoping that the famous names and faces cement the whole gig. No, the film exploits its acting squad just right, making even the secondary/expendable characters memorable. So it's actually not so big of a surprise that the whole emotional narrative of this film is built not around the classic 'beauty and the beast' line but around a letter that one of the soldiers keeps writing to his son. And the fact that that soldier is played by Toby Kebbell, the same guy who's behind Kong himself, adds even more humanity to this film, something that even the talented Andy Serkis failed to bring to its 2005 predecessor.Even though Kong: Skull Island is far from perfect, with its own preposterous moments, it's still a film that's enjoyable to watch. And it's something that even being the third remake can't spoil.",7,6,11,24 June 2017
Arrival," A psychological drama in disguise
","Remember Lucy? That film made by a French director about a girl who took a brain-enhancing drug which gave her abilities beyond logical comprehension. Well, if you do then Arrival, made by another French director, might be something you're prepared for.Is it completely true? Both yes and no. Yes, because this film tries to take a different path unfolding a rather exploited premise, breaking both the clichés and the barriers of plausibility. No, because this time action is not the means by which the film talks to its audience. Not the main means at least.It's hard to discuss the film's details without crossing onto the land of spoilers, and you definitely don't want this film to be spoiled for you. But one thing is for sure: if you don't mind some suspension of disbelief and if you perceive cinema not just as a carrier of logically-grounded and scientifically-proved statements but rather as a conduit for emotions, then Arrival is a kind of a movie you might not wanna miss.At the center of this intertwined whirlwind of human feelings and grand scientific revelations is a figure of Louise Baker (played by Amy Adams), a top-level linguist summoned to establish contact with a group of aliens. Mrs Adams, along with her co-star Jeremy Renner who played Ian Donnelly, a physicist and Louise's colleague, are no strangers to the films featuring extraterrestrial creatures. Yet it's not the sci-fi that has the most value in Arrival. It's the whole gamut of our very human emotions, from fear, anger and desperation to hope, happiness and love. And while there are some nice visuals to please our eyes in this film, and some intellectual claims and assumptions to make our brains engaged, it's the feelings, and how painfully exposed emotion-wise Amy Adams goes to convey them, are what you keep thinking about and sensing once the film is over. And that, in our utterly material world, is an achievement of its own accord.I still can't get over the obvious parallels with Lucy, something that you'll probably be thinking about as well once you've seen the films. Yet Lucy, albeit so action-packed and fast-paced, felt incredibly hollow inside, so hollow that the absurdity of its premise becomes first apparent and then abhorrent. Here, however, the absurdity is just a single step you only have to take once, in a leap of faith, to reach the connection with what's happening on screen. Just like Louise, who reaches out to the alien creatures to be able to communicate with them in their strange language, this film talks to us and induces thoughts and emotions both familiar and so irrelevant to what's seemingly being discussed. What do we make of our lives? Do we regret our mistakes? Would we change something if we knew what it's gonna end with? Would we wanna keep living at all? There are no correct answers to those questions, neither in this film nor anywhere else, but sometimes even simply asking could make a change. After all, some things are just a reflection of how we see and treat them.",8,0,4,5 February 2017
Parasite," Up and down the ladders
","Some stories are plain and simple, a line from A to B. Some are convoluted mindgame mazes that force you to solve riddles or to stay forever lost. And then there's this film. A traditional Asian gift of layers upon layers of wrapping, each concealing and disguising not just the shape but the essence of what's inside. And in the end, the gift might not be what's in there, but the act of unwrapping itself.I'm amazed how Bong Joon Ho tricks us into believing that this is a cheap con artist comedy at first. It was almost natural to shout 'No way! This can't be the film everyone's raving about!'. Had I recalled that this man has also written Snowpiercer, I would not have been so simple. Just like the rich family whose house the parasites have invaded, naive and gullible, ready to call the number on the first business card given, we fall into the traps of easy interpretations, and Bong knows it well enough, giving us all these hints we understand only after a while.Parasite is definitely not about the action, and maybe not even about the visual brilliance, although the scene of running down the stairs, equally physical, social and psychological, under the rain is a phenomenally executed message, just like a scene of an elevated toilet bowl regurgitating back what it's fed up taking in is an image only a person who made two Oscars kiss could come up with. In terms of graphic expression and witty dialogues, Parasite could make both Tarantino and Miyazaki proud, all at the same time.This is no doubt a fancy wrapping, but the best thing about this film is what you feel through it. From condescending disbelief, to light interest, to full engagement, to the sense of watching a social message play within a movie, to feeling as if no borders of genre or common sense exist at all, to feeling dumbfounded and uncomfortable, to a sudden calm. As if a petty half-penny story has taken you into a Zen parable.In the end, nothing remains. An experience that leaves you blank as a mountain side under the snow. So if you do see a light in the distance, don't rush to decode its signals. Just enjoy the scenery while it lasts. After all, it's what you came all the way up for.",10,2,3,19 April 2020
Rango," Quite chaotic and rather delirious, but still fun
","When we hear about a Gore Verbinski/Johnny Depp tandem, we all know what movie franchise comes to mind first. Pirates of the Caribbean is a huge defining point for both the director and the actor, since the former will hardly ever beat the overall success of it with any other movie, and for the latter his character of Captain Jack Sparrow was, is and probably will stay the most recognizable image he ever brought to life. It's hard to get away from your fame, and it's probably the case when it becomes your curse - just like the Black Pearl's crew was cursed for being too successful at plundering.At first glance, it's hard to imagine anything more opposite to Pirates of the Caribbean than Rango. And not only because it's an animation. Rango is a story of a pet chameleon who's deeply in the hell of a self-identification crisis, and Captain Jack Sparrow would be the last person in the world to question himself who he is. Yet there's a strong vibe of the whole PotC trilogy (to me it IS a trilogy) coming from Rango. The Curse of the Black Pearl was all adventures, Dead Man's Chest was all goofy and slapstick, and At World's End was a rather surreal journey to the other side. And Rango has it all.But in this attempt to transmit the already well-mastered recipe for success from one franchise to another Gore Verbinski chose the second installment of PotC as the base tone. Which is weird, because, apart from being a huge commercial hit, Dead Man's Chest was a rather flat and over-the-top action adventure which, as most second episodes of trilogies do, simply served as a link towards the climactic third act. And while Rango was showing some promise to become a parable of the social inequality, a satire about brainwashing, vice and exploitation, and finally a story of a person on his self-exploring journey, it's still mostly a situation comedy where a striving for local punchlines outweighs a global dramatic effect. Jump funny, say fancy words very fast and make weird noises - and you're good to go. Yee-haw!I guess it's actually enough for the audience that simply wants to be entertained. After all, Rango is beautifully animated, and it definitely delivers a feast for your senses. But for those who prefer to go deeper, Rango could be a much more fulfilling, albeit not so happy, tribute to Johnny Depp's own thespian journey. Rango is a chameleon, an ever-mimicking creature, who has to play a character he invented himself - because he has no idea who he actually is as a person. Just like Johnny Depp himself, who had enacted so many personas during his actor's career that to most people he's just Jack Sparrow or even 'that guy from that movie'. It may be a hymn to the whole tribe of actors, but Johnny Depp is probably the most prominent example of a person who's been in so many pairs of shoes throughout his whole life that it's getting difficult to remember which one is actually yours.The ending, when our hero rides into sunset to solidify himself as an icon to be remembered, is a sort of a silent resignation to this fate. After all, what's the point in trying to define and defend your personal individuality if everyone else will still have his own image of you that's only vaguely related to the reality. Apparently, this choice goes beyond a single film, because in the next work of the aforementioned tandem, The Lone Ranger, Johnny Depp's character is all but a legend alive, with hardly anything truly human in it. Depp may be a most perfect hanger for film personas, but they do start to feel somewhat empty inside. Just like this film itself. But if you're not looking for more than what meets the eye, you'll be thoroughly entertained, because, even though the make-up may be flaking, the smile still stays on. Show must go on, and it will go on. Amen.",6,0,0,20 June 2015
The Big Short," Vigorous as The Wolf of Wall Street, depressing as Margin Call
","Like i said in my review of Spotlight, there are two kinds of movies that are inherently American: courthouse drama and journalism one. I guess i have missed the third kind: a Wall Street money porn. Yeah, it's not just drama, because in each of these films someone gets screwed so hard it's sometimes scary.Since Wall Street (1987), we're being told the stories about greed, ambition and moral flexibility that have a permanent residence at that part of NYC. Some stories are more light-hearted, some are of a gloomy kind. But all of them are quite exciting to watch if made right. And since The Wolf of Wall Street was such a big hit, i guess someone has decided that maybe the darkest page in the history of US economy of at least the last 50 years could be given a similar presentation. In fact, The Big Short's intro and Ryan Gosling's opening monologue were such a direct reference to the Scorsese film that it almost felt like a blatant rip-off. So when Margot Robbie made her cameo as a stunning blonde drinking champagne while taking a bath with a seaside view, i was hardly surprised at all.Still, The Big Short is not just a dark comedy about the '08 economic crisis. In fact, it's hardly a comedy at all. It tries to lighten the moods with some witty gags or episodic hilariousness, but it doesn't really conceal how depressing, sad and wrong the main topic of the film is. Steve Carell's character is the best reflection of we are left to experience: if at first he's just angry and fuming and yelling at people, then at the end all he can do is sit all bent and silent. And that's a guy who got $200 million out of this big scam, now imagine how a regular homeowner who's been thrown out on the street for being late on his insanely overpriced mortgage must have felt.Despite being a truly dramatic and emotional movie about a very important moment in our history, The Big Short is not without a flaw. I guess some stories are just too overwhelming to take them on from all the angles at the same time. Not only did The Big Short try to recreate the timeline of that crisis and show us the stories of several people, each with their own hard life paths that had much more tragedy than Wall Street could be responsible for, but it also tried its best to educate people and give them the basics of the financial competence. A noble endeavor, but the gap between an encyclopedic and a fictionalized approach is too big for a film to be comfortable trying to embrace them both at the same time. Which, despite all the film's efforts to be as simple and clear as possible, leaves the audience kinda numb and dumbfounded, with the only thought left being 'thank god it's over'. Both the crisis and the story. Since most of the real-life prototypes of the main movie characters quit the financial industry, they probably felt the same way too: it was good while it lasted, but now let's move on to something more pleasant.",8,0,1,2 March 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Don't follow this white rabbit
","It's hard to blame me for the lack of love for Zach Snyder's works. No matter what this man does, he'll still remain a genius to me for 300 and Watchmen. However, no love in the world could make me call Batman v Superman a masterpiece.Truth be told, I haven't seen the theatrical cut, going right for the Ultimate version instead, so I can't say whether the cinema critics were right in finding this film so abysmal. The extended version is almost three hours long, and although those hours do have a spark of genius in them, for the most part it can be said that Snyder seems to have forgotten that he himself isn't the main audience and got lost in his own visions and interpretations.If you thought Nolan's Batman was dark and depressing then welcome to the Snyder's vision of Bruce Wayne, who's borderline psychotic during the day and is outright maniacal during his bat-costumed nights. Dwelling on the traumatized past is what Zack Snyder has already told us a story about once in Sucker Punch, so no wonder that this time his characters are either balancing on the edge of insanity and emotional breakdown or are well beyond that line. Combined with the classic noir'ish atmosphere of the Batman universe and with the intentionally disjointed and fragmented storytelling Snyder employs this time, it produces a powerful bizarre effect when the borders of reality get blurred and you aren't sure whether what you see is really happening or it's just a product of some character's sick subconsciousness. The apogee of that surrealism is Bruce Wayne's Batman dream, which, in my opinion, is the single best part of the film that still has enough punch to show you that Snyder used to be called the most innovative and visionary director of the 2000's for a reason.But, as the story progresses, it loses its charm of an unhealthy illusion and becomes more and more mediocre in its reality. Bruce Wayne's motives behind the blind hatred towards Superman, which aren't important at first because Batman as a character isn't reasonable as a whole, become more and more blunt and shallow, to the point where he can be provoked by a series of notes written on paychecks. The action sequences, the dialogues, the character emotions - they all signalize that Snyder had probably been bitten by Michael Bay under the full moon, so now the virus which makes people shoot mindless generic messy fights with lots of destruction and explosions has found a new carrier and even mutated.It's a pity how much talent had been buried under the ruins of Batman v Superman. It's like The Avengers inside out: alone by themselves, the new Superman and even the new Batman are (or might have been if we had a standalone Batman film by now) solid and wholesome, but together they create a whirlwind of undercooked mess that leaves absolutely no aftertaste (which I'm even grateful for in this case). The only person who managed to stand out is Jesse Eisenberg, who, after having shined in The Social Network as a misanthropical eccentric nerd with a suppressed contempt for the world, seemed to have a real itch to put on those shoes once again.",6,1,4,7 July 2016
Jojo Rabbit," A healing experience
","Here in Russia, it's a common opinion that we have a twisted perception of German language because the first encounter with it usually happens when we watch a war movie, where hearing the German speech usually means that something really bad is about to happen. I'm not sure if I ever had nightmares about running away from 'Ze Germans', but just the sound of Till Lindemann counting from one to ten does indeed sound like some unholy incantation.My generation is maybe the last one still scarred with this cultural propaganda. There have been so many war films made in the USSR days, and those films still keep on coming. And the absolute most of them feed you two main things: fear and hate. I wish it was otherwise, I really do. But that's how it is, and it's part of the reason I never really liked war movies as a kid.So I can honestly say one thing. Jojo Rabbit is the best war movie that I've never seen in my childhood. But I'm still grateful that it happened now. Despite being such a grotesquely simplified guilty pleasure, it has one thing any other serious films about this topic lack: sanity. That, and humanity. The 10 year old boy with scars on his face and a swastika on his armband somehow managed to keep his soul intact, and that child's purity is what allows you to see the horrors of war but avoid its traumas.It might be Waititi's writing that won this film an Oscar. But the heart of it was carried by Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell. Ever since Lost in Translation it was clear that Johansson can act, but for me this film has revealed her ability to steal scenes and carry them single-handedly. That soot mustache speech and a dance that ensued, that's quite mature for someone generally associated with 'sexy' characters. And Mr Rockwell, oh my, I didn't like him since The Green Mile, respected him since Moon and loved him since Seven Psychopaths, but here he's just a perfect cherry on top. The last battle attire, that smokey-eyed stare, he's a true hero for giving the Nazi image a face nobody has probably dared to put on before, at least not in such a dashing and self-accepting way.The accolades could go on and on. To Waititi's 'your own, personal Adolf', to Jojo himself, who managed to come from a clumsy kid to a swaggering hustler at the end, to the brave and gentle ghost in the walls. Waititi has a talent for using the little details that look simple but add that very taste that turns cloying into touching and dumb into funny. He's done it before, and he's clearly doing it this time as well.Whatever silly nonsense this film has shown, it is not something to be bothered about I think. If a war movie has to be surrealistic to spread love instead of hate, let it be. There's nothing civil about war anyway, so better a funny Hitler than the real one.",8,0,1,19 April 2020
Lucy," An epically shameless nonsense
","What if i told you, in a subtle but persuasive manner, that if you had a third leg you could shoot it like a blaster? Or that if you stuck your finger deep inside your nose you'd produce a quantum fluctuation? Or that squishing your feces would allow you to time travel? Well, i tell you what: if i'm lucky, you'd just beat the sh!t out of me, and if i'm not - you'd deliver me to the mental clinic and tell them to never let me out because i'm a freaking lunatic. And guess what: you'd be totally right!The problem is, this movie essentially does to you the same as what i described before, but honestly and even naively expects you to take it for granted as some sublime wisdom and enlightening experience. To do that, it uses three components it considers omnipotent: Morgan Freeman as 'deep', Scarlett Johansson as 'sexy' and lots of random CGI as 'cool'. Well, and some shoot-outs and car chases as a cherry on top.The fact is, even though these components seem to mesmerize some of the people to make them believe there's some deep essence in this film, they are surely not omnipotent. Because they definitely fail to transform this utter piece of crap into anything decent.The only way to believe that Luc Besson's not completely insane is to assume that 'Lucy' is his way to say 'f@ck you' to the viewers and to make them pay for it afterwards. And if it's true then one can only wonder how much of the brain capacity that grateful audience actually utilizes.",2,3,8,25 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Same story from a different storyteller, love it or hate it
","My first review of TFA focused on the film's objective merits, but it was massively downvoted by disgruntled old-school fans (i assume). Only after that did i find out that the vast majority of the IMDb reviews of this film are actually very negative. So after brooding over this unjustified hate i decided to write a new review, this time concentrating on the reasons why the fans might hate TFA so much.First of all, i'm gonna admit one simple truth: TFA does look more like a soft reboot rather than a fully independent sequel. It's not necessarily a bad thing, because the film doesn't rub it into your eyes too hard, and you could still genuinely enjoy the story it tells. But after the movie's over and your initial delight settles, it becomes quite clear that The Force Awakens is A New Hope's little brother: it's not exactly the same, but the family traits are too obvious to be unnoticed.But if the most of the fans love and cherish the originals, why so much hate towards something that is clearly in awe of the old trilogy's spirit and passes on the best of its qualities? I believe that the answer lies not within the film itself, but in our own psychology. We simply loved the originals, both story- and character-wise, too much, and now anything that dares to have a similar look and feel is considered a disgusting impostor instead of a friend who has lots in common with you.People criticize TFA for badly acted or cliché characters, for a lack of epic battles and a pace too fast. And it's true that J.J. Abrams managed to fit a huge piece of story in just two hours of the screen time. But can we blame him for trying to show us as much as possible without getting distracted on the secondary and unimportant details that were only dragging the originals back? Especially since he had such a huge ground to cover by introducing the new characters and binding them to the old ones.As for the characters, the truth is that J.J. gave us the same archetypes we saw in the originals, but mixed and spread them across several characters. Luke Skywalker's righteousness and yearning to find out about his past are now with Rey, who also inherited Leia's willpower and resolve. Han Solo's mix of emotions, adventurer's spirit and loyalty to his friends now lie in Finn, whose visceral energy and vividness keep the world spinning when the times are hard. And Han Solo himself becomes a mentor for the young lot, serving almost the same purpose as Obi-Wan once did. It's almost no wonder that (spoiler alert, skip the rest of the paragraph if you wanna avoid it) his fate turned out to be so similar. However, if you think of it, it was inevitable, because for the young to come of age they have to face their fears without their father figure to stand by and protect them.What Abrams did to Star Wars is similar to what Daniel Craig did to the James Bond franchise (and i don't mean Spectre, think Casino Royale instead). Craig's biggest achievement was that he gave us all a reason to doubt that there is only one James Bond and that there is no school like the old school. It was a breath of fresh air, a long-awaited rival who could do the similar things but do them differently, giving us a diversity we could satisfy our taste with. Some might have hated Craig for that, but it was a hate of jealousy, simply because the old king could rule unquestionably no longer.But, as that rejection of Craig was silly back then, so is the today's hate towards TFA. We simply can't stop the progress, stop people from bringing the old stories up to date and telling them in a way that could help the young of today fall in love with them, just like the old trilogy fans fell in love with it almost 40 years ago. The originals are good, but let's face it: some of their aspects look and feel archaic now, diminishing the power of an otherwise perpetually appealing story. So instead of criticizing the director or the cast for not giving you what you expected, simply try taking The Force Awakens as it is, just like you took A New Hope when you had no idea what to expect at all. And maybe then you'll finally admit that Abrams did an amazing job conveying so much love for the Star Wars universe but making that love accessible to the next generation of people for whom the old trilogy just doesn't do it anymore.J.J., thank you for your marvelous job, and only the time will show if your vision guides the upcoming trilogy to the stars. May the Force be with you and with us all.",9,3,23,25 March 2016
Deadpool," Deadpool, the first truly postmodern superhero. And it's not a compliment
","Back in 2008 when Scarlett Johansson married Ryan Reynolds, who I only knew back then as the sidekick from Blade Trinity, the celebrity gossip sites (another one of my guilty pleasures of that time) praised that guy for having a typical Canadian trait of self-irony. Back then it seemed like a good thing. Now, eight years from then, Ms Johansson is in the past and Mr Reynolds is by no means a sidekick anymore. But the self-irony still remains, and this time it found a fresh, almost gargantuan outlet.The genre of superhero movies is always at risk of catching a disease of repetitiveness and predictability, which is no wonder considering those big manly chins that are constantly pulling you down. So, just like Wade Wilson, at some point it had to start mutating into something fresher and more curious to retain the viewer's attention. It may be a pleasure to watch a superhero, but it's a much bigger pleasure when he is not exactly super, or not exactly a hero. Tobey Maguire might not be Spider-Man that every kid dreamed of becoming one day, but his Spidey was a person we all could relate to, with his own flaws and imperfections. A superperson who's still genuinely human inside.Then it was time for the genre to mutate again, to show that heroing can actually be fun (contrary to Christian Bale and all the X-Men's sullen faces). First it was Kick-Ass, an amazing example of how great it can be to make the protagonist a total amateur. And then, of course, Green Hornet, with Seth Rogen taking the concept of a superhero to a completely hysterically ridiculously awesome level.Well, apparently the world needs a hero again. And since all the big-chinned roles are already taken by the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth, this time the filmmakers decided to go deeper and produce a completely new type of a superhero - one that takes nothing seriously, himself included.There's no denying that Deadpool is good at being that type of a film. With Reynolds giving us a wisecracker who's both marveling at and deriding himself at the same time, and with the entourage that from the opening credits rams home the idea that no ego will be left inviolable tonight, Deadpool feels like a hot stand-up show but with fists flying, bullets buzzing and swords clashing, all in a single bedazzling whirlwind.However, the first stun only lasts for about a half of the movie, after which you start realizing that Ryan Reynolds indeed got this far not thanks to his superior acting method. The gay jokes wear out, the snarky remarks miss the spot and become annoying, and the shallowness of the sidelines gets so obvious that even the constant breaks of the fourth wall to self-admit it don't make it much better. The only thing that keeps holding you is the villains, who, despite being made of cardboard by design, hold their ground exactly because their typicality is authentic.And that is what's wrong with the postmodern approach. In attempt to bring it further on by parasitizing on the idea that there could be no 'further on' at all, Deadpool eventually loops and bumps into its own rear. And no matter how Mr Reynolds might enjoy his rear to be bumped into, it doesn't compensate for the lack of heart he brings into this film, which is even comical considering the obvious binding to the theater release on the Valentine's Day, and equally tragic considering that Reynolds can, in fact, pull off decent roles, like the one in Mississippi Grind. Sorry Ryan, but this time watching you was like listening to Barenaked Ladies: the music is good and the vocals are decent, but at some point you simply realize that the lyrics are just whiny and immature, and that spoils all the fun. I only hope that Chris Evans will bring that fun back, because despite the big chin, his Captain America also has an equally big heart.I'd give it 6.5, but since IMDb only deals in whole numbers, let's round it up.

Kingsman: The Secret Service," From chav to gentleman in two hours
","It's actually a rare occasion that you see a movie based on a comic book about British people. Until i managed to recall V for Vendetta, i thought it's my first rendezvous with a material of such sort. Especially since it revolves around a figure of an English gentleman, and who can be a more unlikely comic book hero than a tea-drinking suit-wearing umbrella-cane-carrying snob?Well, this is where it gets interesting. Because, although our main gentleman figure is played by Colin Firth, a seasoned veteran of Regency era courtships and chivalry, it's not gonna be a Pride and Prejudice of any sort. What we have here is a modern day dandy spy squad. But it's not just James Bond dressed for Royal Ascot. It's more like Captain America dressed (and mannered) for the same sort of thing. Fancy, ain't it?But, as with a recipe for a proper Martini, all the ingredients, including the last one, are equally important. And, as a cherry (or should i say an olive) on top, we have here a little social confrontation, because our modern time knight with impeccable looks and manners chooses as his apprentice a young chav'ish guy, who's equally talented and troublesome.At this point, i believe that anyone who's at least mildly interested in the action/adventure movie genre will be intrigued to the limit. And they should be, because Kingsman: The Secret Service delivers a today's interpretation of the ages old fairy tale about a commoner who rose up and got into the highest ranks thanks only to his courage, wits and honor. And this time, instead of bows and swords, we have shotguns and super spy gadgets.Surely, as any fairy tale, Kingsman is hardly a sci-fi. So don't expect much plausibility here, since what's believable is not always fun. Instead, enjoy how marvelously graphic this movie is, how brilliantly the fighting scenes are filmed and how insanely surreal (or surreally insane) the main villain is. It takes a courage and some wild imagination to actually transform the current collective subconscious into a figure of flesh and blood and make this figure really evil, but only evil enough to still take it seriously. Because, as we know from the old Bond movies, the over-the-top baddies cause more laugh than fright, and we don't want the audience to laugh before the punch line, do we?But no matter how gentleman material you are, it's hard not to get your suit wrinkled and specked a bit when it's raining punches and bullets. So, while Kingsman is light-hearted and jolly enough to be on par with Kick-Ass, it certainly lacks some depth and character development. Surely, we see how Eggsy, the ballsy (no pun intended) Galahad's protégé, goes from that council housing punk to well-esteemed gentleman with fighting skills straight from The Matrix. What we don't see is some real, not fairy tale sort of, challenge he has to overcome to become what he becomes. Just a bit of brawling with some higher-born competitors and one skydiving trick - that's all. He doesn't even seem to break a sweat, which falls in line with the fairy tale style, but lacks realism so much that it undermines the value of the achievement somewhat. And yes, there's product placement. So explicit and blatant that they even make Colin Firth endorse McDonald's as a part of a dialogue. I try not to be a snob, but that was a bit too much.So, while Kingsman is hardly a movie that would hold you enthralled on a re-watch, it's still entertaining enough for your first date to be pleasant. It's fresh enough, funny enough, and who would skip an opportunity to see Colin Firth kicking major ass for three minutes straight? Not me for sure. And neither should you, because for that alone watching Kingsman can be a lifetime experience ;).",8,3,8,23 May 2015
Cube," Blunt and badly delivered
","Cube is one of the movies that brag being not what they seem. This sure is true, because one has to be insane to take a movie with such a bizarre and contrived setting at face value.And of course it's a metaphor. At least it's what the creators of Cube wanted to think they were making. When you do something utterly unrealistic and make your characters behave in the most unlikely and unnatural way imaginable, you must believe you're conveying some sort of a message via those acts.Unfortunately, the director and the screenwriter seem to forget what a metaphor is. Metaphor is a second layer, concealed and subtle, of anything that is still rather believable, albeit shallow, on the surface. You can't simply blurt out some message you consider important out of the blue and think it adds artistic value to your product. But here, this is exactly what happens. If the movie wants to make an allegory of society as a giant machine in which people are just little cogs, it does no more than just make one of the characters say something like 'we're nothing but cogs spinning in this huge machine'. If it wants to claim that life is a headless beast with no mastermind but human stupidity, it also bluntly says it out loud. That's not a metaphor, and it's definitely not art. It's just ravings of a madman, which can be enlightening to some who are desperate to find a hidden meaning in everything, but are still more or less a pointless nonsense if observed on a long run.But the script is not the only weak point of this movie. The acting which starts as just blah, goes to laughable to hysterical to preposterous. Obviously, in a movie that views itself as a naked metaphor, the characters are all but walking archetypes, but, with the delirious approach the film has taken, they are hardly more than caricatures of the types they were supposed to enact. And that is really sad, because no matter how much promise your idea shows, when it's delivered that bad one is only left to shrug and wonder on what drugs the film makers were.Still, Cube undeniably has at least one true virtue. Which is to be an example for the new and aspiring cinema artists of what can happen when you take a promising premise and screw it up with a bland and uninspiring implementation.",5,4,7,22 June 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," Stylish, yet empty
","John Wick is back, and once again he's the person others constantly sing praises to. Limping more than ever, and looking as if he's about to turn into wood any second, he's still inexplicably unkillable and wondrously fatal. So fatal that sometimes his victims prefer to kill themselves, simply to grant themselves the luxury of dying their own way.This movie upped the stakes style- and execution-wise, that's for certain. And even though the plot is ridiculously thin and the action as repetitive as an FPS game, one could not deny John Wick: Chapter 2 a certain charm. However, just like Mr Wick's magical ability to withstand death, that charm is an artificially crafted gizmo delivered by the hands of many unnamed (or not so much) characters put everywhere for the entourage. The entourage that gets viciously exploited by Keanu Reeves wearing the same single face everywhere and saying his wooden lines like an animated corpse. Without Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Lawrence Fushburne, Common, that equally hot and deadly mute girl, even without Riccardo Scamarcio and his character, John Wick is just a bogeyman: a ghost of a scary story which can only frighten little kids but loses its potency once they grow up a bit.",6,8,19,31 May 2017
Annihilation," Yet another sad sci-fi
","It's funny how we love categorizing things, as if putting a label on something makes it easier to understand. 'Science Fiction' is one of those labels which makes us think we know what to expect. But sci-fi films may be as different as a horror movie and a Mickey Mouse documentary. There are serious sci-fi's like Terminator or Alien, there are epic sci-fi's like Avatar, there are even yeehaw sci-fi's like Back to the Future.And there's this genre I'd call SSD. Slow, Sad and Disturbing. Something sad like Nocturnal Animals, something slow like Arrival, something disturbing like Enemy, but joined together into a single pseudo-hypnotic experience.Annihilation isn't gonna annihilate anything but two hours of your time spent on watching this. What it can give instead as a semi-bitter and semi-disgusting sense of wading through treacle of the author's convoluted imagination and troubled visions.It can also give you some food for thought and imagery abstract enough to stir your own desire to interpret things. Which may be the major goal for any art form. In this sense, Annihilation does indeed not destroy, but instead just changes what exists and creates what hadn't existed before.If you find this text difficult to interpret and not too pleasant to read, that's probably a good thing, because it's giving you a sense of what you'll probably feel watching this film. So it's up to you to decide whether you wanna volunteer for such a task. However, one thing is certain: if you are tired of banal stories and superheroes with blasters, then Annihilation would certainly become a refreshing experience.",6,0,1,6 October 2019
Incredibles 2," The Washed-Ups
","It is a clear sunny day boding nothing bad, and then suddenly a random guy bursts in on a giant drilling machine, robs a bank and literally sucks it dry, making off to an undetermined direction with his prize.I can't help thinking that this is the best way to describe what Incredibles 2 did to its paying audience. I haven't paid a penny to see this film, but even I felt robbed, of my time, my hope for having a good taste in cinema, and - most importantly - my good memory of the first Incredibles.It's been 15 years since the first film had been released, but instead of going forward the sequel seems to have gone back in time, to the fantasy 60's that only existed in the James Bond movies. The super family, however, had frozen in time and looks almost the same, but those real life years have indeed taken its toll - in the form of Holly Hunter's voice, which now sounds as if Elastigirl is an elderly lady not yet accustomed to her new dentures. And that is just the first of many more stark contrasts between look and feel Incredibles 2 aren't able to hide.Another thing that deteriorated just as bad as Elastigirl's voice is the filmmakers' ability to distinguish quality and hollow filler. I don't remember all the details of the first film, it's been quite a while indeed, but I do remember that, despite intentionally goofy graphics, it felt real enough in terms of sincerity. That super family acted in a way that made you care, and the plot was a balance between keeping it reasonable and providing enough surprise factor.This time, however, we get a clumsy mix of hollow action scenes, generic parent-child moments, really forced promotion of gender equality and a dystopian anti-brainwashing message more fitting the bleak Blade Runner universe instead of the colorful tech-happy retrofuture. Watching the kids do kid stuff is now more tiring than cute, and the little family quarrels from amusing become ridiculous. Just like the new villain's persona and motive.Overall, Incredibles 2 made me realize once again that some things aren't meant to be remade or continued. Especially if you can't add anything new or fresh to what's been said and done earlier. And if you're not that good with creativity anymore, at least let your heroes grow up a bit. Because seeing kids not ageing a day in fifteen years makes one feel like John Nash from A Beautiful Mind, and that proved to be not the most healthy thing.",5,3,6,12 March 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," War glamorized
","There's a certain charm about true stories adapted for cinema. Because, while the fiction lacks absolute constraints, giving the screenwriters more liberty and allowing for some laziness, true stories must remain true - and at the same time must be told captivatingly to keep you thrilled. Finding the right balance between the naked truth and the gloss of creative imagination to make the truth shine is a real art.However, some true stories don't tell us much besides what happened, omitting the 'how' part. Such stories are basically legends, no matter how ancient or contemporary. And in this case, it's up to the movie creators to recreate the how, often not based on bare facts but on their own perception. And that, in my opinion, is what happened to Hacksaw Ridge thanks to Mel Gibson.Hollywood has made quite a few war movies, genres varying from dashing black humor like Inglorious Basterds to eerie surrealism like Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. Yet what Hacksaw Ridge reminded me of first was Malick's The Thin Red Line. Stylistically very unlike, both these movies still tell a story about the same war. And it only makes it more obvious how different are Malick's and Gibson's takes on that story.Malick's war was a useless and ugly thing, a notion that fills everyone's minds, transcends the boundaries between people's personalities and unifies people on both sides of the front line. It's a stain that lies upon you no matter which side you fight for, and corrupts you from within, to the point when there's no good and evil anymore and everything is a single grey mess and everyone is an equal part of it.But Gibson's vision is different. This man has been long known for his fascination with pain and violence, from the explicit focus on his own character's torture in Braveheart to the gory details of Jesus' fate in The Passion of the Christ. This man's obsession with showing pain and death on screen may raise questions about his morals or sanity, but at least he's being thorough and consistent with it.And Hacksaw Ridge was yet another proof of that. With all the beautiful healthy faces put in the middle of the carnage of war, with blood, guts and brain pieces splashing out of gun wounds like little fountains, with cartridge cases ejected from rifles and machine guns like some confetti, Gibson creates a hymn to the war, as if it was a holy gift, cleansing the unworthy and leaving the pure intact. And in the middle of that hymn, is the figure of Desmond Doss, portrayed by Andrew Garfield in a way Saint Sebastian would be jealous of, with his face glowing with some perverse naivety and conscious righteousness. The hybrid erotism and holiness of Gibson's vision of Doss are further enforced by two landmark scenes of the film: the scene with Garfield alone on that ridge, pulling the ropes and letting them loose, with his lean figure against the dark smoky sky, sensualized to the point you'd rather expect from the likes of 50 Shades of Grey, and the scene of Doss slowly sliding down the ridge in a stretcher, with a strong parallel to some divine experience you simply can't help coming to think of.Still, at the end of the day Hacksaw Ridge is a story of a real person who has performed an unbelievable feat in a middle of a true bloodbath, has done something that nobody ever expected of him. And that achievement is a fact that no director's vision could distort or negate. We'll never know for sure where the real Desmond Doss was taking his courage and strength from, and, to be honest, it's the kind of spiritual privacy a person is entitled to. But, private or not, I would still prefer the fact-based stories to follow their roots instead of becoming a victim of a storyteller's inflamed imagination. And while Hacksaw Ridge literally smells of Mel Gibson's own personal beliefs and tastes, apparently it's that rare case when the spirit of a story is so strong that, no matter how hard you twist it or bend it to your own will, it remains true to itself where it really matters.",7,2,5,21 February 2017
Warcraft," RPG + RTS - brains
","I still remember the times around 1996, when Warcraft II was my first big computer game love. I didn't know much English, so the story briefings between missions were mostly just a text scrolling upwards. The mission goals also weren't making sense most of the time. But the action was fun! Train a pack of infantry units and send them kill someone. Zug-zug, job's done!Now, 20 years from then, the Warcraft universe has expanded into a huge cash-making factory, going so far from its RTS roots that it even includes a movie now. Well, the funny thing is, when I was watching that movie, I felt like that ignorant kid again. But this time the game I was offered to play lacked any excitement.If there's a list of typical fantasy film mistakes, Warcraft has made most of them. The characters are introduced with the same neglect as some game NPCs, leaving you no room to guess why they are what they are and where they are. The plot progresses in a mission-like style, jumping from one location to another with hardly enough glue to put it all together. And the dialogues are an embarrassing mix of fake second-rate epic clichés and equally fake tearjerking tirades compared to which the soap opera drama feels truly Shakespearean. Combined, all of that makes you guess whether Warcraft was an Uwe Boll creation.It's not that horribly bad though. The cast is rather fresh and not taken from an old moldy and moth-ridden wardrobe. The CGI, although sloppy at times, is up to par and not cheap. And if you really try to turn your brains off while watching it, Warcraft might even be a way to spend two hours without getting bored, especially if you can appreciate its universe and like being given an easter egg once in a while. But don't expect anything beyond that sort of popcorn entertainment, otherwise you risk being bitterly disappointed.",3,2,4,12 September 2016
Sully," When too much glorification is not a good thing
","I'm sure that every one of you knows the story behind this film. A passenger plane dies in the air above NYC, and the captain pulls off a tricky save by landing the machine on the Hudson. A great job indeed. And one way too appealing to make a movie about.But it's just too boring to tell a story about a person who did his job right and saved a lot of lives. Or that's what the cinema bosses might be thinking. So let's bring in some less genuine or relevant conflict about the corporate pigs who always aim to blame the little man, or about the confused wife and financial struggle back at home. Yeah, that's so much better, now we can actually root for our guy even more and see that even if you're a hero for the whole nation you still have severe issues to fix. And what would be better than seeing the little man prevail and beat the evil system fair and square for all the world to see?Well, I don't know how exactly it was in reality, but the one created by Clint Eastwood was a bit too cloying to be appealing. Of course, it's impossible to criticize the work of one of the most esteemed actors-turned-director of late, featuring one of the most esteemed actors of the last decades, especially when it is about a true heroic story America could wholeheartedly call its own. So it's just easier to ignore the general lack of a true drama in this film and let yourself be tricked into spending a few bucks to watch something that would at last make you feel proud to be an American. After all, it's not just New York that was in a desperate need of good news, especially those about an airplane.I'm not an American. Still, it's no problem for me to admit that what the real Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger did was extraordinary. What the movie industry did with this story, however, is much farther from 'extraordinary' and much closer to 'sentiment exploiting and money grabbing'. Which of course is a form of art as well, just not as fine and noble as saving lives on board of a plane doing down.",6,0,0,5 January 2017
Alien: Covenant," A truly mixed bag
","In certain circles, there's a term called 'coproeconomics', which basically implies making inherently flawed products with planned ageing, so that you'd be able to sell the same thing, only slightly modified, again and again and again. The progress between iterations might be ever so slight, and the emphasis on quality might eliminate most of those iterations as unnecessary, yet the manufacturer needs its profits, and we need to buy something to feel up-to-date and privileged.Alien: Covenant, if I'm not mistaken, is the 6th installment of the Alien franchise (if we take Prometheus, which I haven't seen, into account). Still a long way to go to catch up with the Fast'n'Furious production line, yet quite a handful in itself. How come Ridley Scott still has ideas to build new Alien films upon, and the audience keeps going to the theaters to check them out? The answer that seems correct to me is: to make something new, take something you already had, cripple it in some way and then add a speck of something refreshing to make up for it.Covenant follows this recipe brilliantly when it comes to crippling. It's the umpteenth time we see humans land on a potentially dangerous planet - yet they keep making the same mistakes they oughta tell about at 'Space Colonization 101'. Still reckless, short-sighted, unable to control their emotions and follow the basic protocols. The equipment follows suit: withstanding extreme overloads, it (in)conveniently breaks exactly when someone's life depends on it. Looks like even in the XXII century the space programs follow the same principles of coproeconomics.What saves Covenant from being a total failure is that speck of originality that this time took form of Michael Fassbender. It's no big secret that in Covenant his character builds upon his role in Prometheus. But it's _how_ he does it that makes all the difference. The Alien movies always got their scares from the confrontation of humans and those deadly creatures. But this time there's something entirely different that makes this film scary, something borderline diabolical, and it's Fassbender's delivery that gave me most of the creeps this time. Without him, this film would've been completely pointless.But even Michael's stellar job doesn't remedy the overall predictability of this film. Maybe if he was the only person on board of Covenant, this film might've become another Moon. But the surgical precision of Fassbender's synthetic character is muddied by the mere mortals making their typical mistakes and playing their typical games. Mere mortals including the director: the revelation near the ending could be seen from a mile away, and only made the sloppiness employed to make it happen more apparent. So unfortunate. But fear not: there's the sequel coming, which will surely fix all its predecessor's flaws. Only to add a load of its own ones. So don't forget to reserve a place in lines in front of the movie theaters: the wheel of coproeconomical samsara ain't gonna spin itself.",5,2,6,3 August 2017
Furious 7," Fast and Expendable
","As if speed-dragging a multi-ton safe and jumping the tank wasn't enough, here comes another larger than life set of car chases, girls' asses, shootouts and mass destruction. And if you thought that the sixth installment was over the top, then brace yourself for a complete re-definition of that term. Because compared to what our old friends do here in Furious Seven, the feats of Ethan Hunt are a wee child's walk in the park.There's one undoubtedly good thing about this film, and it's the fact that it brought Nathalie Emmanuel, hands down the hottest babe from Game of Thrones, back to the big screen. She was definitely the right person to break that typical 'nerdy hacker' stereotype, although for the relevant skills she hardly presents anything besides tapping helplessly on the keyboard when it doesn't even matter and the British accent. But who cares really when you have such hair, face and figure.Other than that, it's the same old Fast'n'Furious routine, which always goes exactly the same way, except this time we all know something unexpected happened in the real world and someone managed to get himself proper f@cked, as Jason Statham could've said in a different time and in a different movie. This is pretty unthinkable for a franchise famous for its damage-proof characters who can get blown out from the 4th floor or fall from a cliff and hardly bleed after that.I wish i could cut the cynicism and get a little sentimental for the film series i spent all my maturity along with, especially since the ending of Furious Seven is a real tearjerker, with Vin Diesel's soliloquy that sounds as if coming both from his character and himself as a person. But the filmmakers simply couldn't resist the temptation to capitalize on Paul Walker's death and announce that the film would be released anyway and that he'd be digitally recreated for whatever scenes he didn't get to do. So instead of simply enjoying the show i came to see this movie for, i couldn't help playing the guess game of whether it's the real Paul or some masterful CGI. And i guess i even found at least one 'fake Paul' scene - a few moments in the episode with the drone and the truck carrying pipes. Or was that the stunt double? Nah, he better not be, otherwise it would ruin the game.Seriously, do you know any other action franchise that outlived the actor playing the main role? (Well, one of two main roles, but whatever.) Can you imagine Mission Impossible without Tom Cruise? Or Expendables without Stallone? Nope, it's just unreal. And even if those actors died halfway through film production and the movie makers decided to finish the job anyway, would their characters be kept alive? Don't think so. Why? Because it's not how the heroes go. They were risking their lives on screen, they were doing it again and again because it meant something for the world, or for themselves. Or maybe they were just missing the bullets. So if they were meant to finally go for good - especially after what happened with Paul who died doing what his character loved the most - they at least deserved to go with a real bang and not in some sappy PG-rated scene. This is an old geezer's way, and the heroes must always die young to be forever remembered.But even if the film didn't do you proper justice, hopefully the time will. Rest in peace, Paul, and may they never make another F&F movie. It would just not be the same without you.",6,1,14,22 July 2015
