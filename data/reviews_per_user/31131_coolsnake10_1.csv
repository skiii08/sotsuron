The Incredible Hulk," Best Marvel Movie
","The Incredible Hulk is the best Marvel Movie yet. It does not waste any time. The beginning is powerful, and it doesn't lose energy. The ending is awesome. I would recommend this to every superhero movie fan. I was not disappointed at all. I don't know why everyone is saying that it is not that good. It is so good! Maybe I have a different taste. I think the movie showcases very well how Bruce has problems with his alter ego. Emil Blonsky, the arrogant soldier working for General Ross, is trying to get his hands on the power of the Hulk, while Bruce is trying to get rid of it. It is great story for anyone. See this movie. It completed me.",10,4,5,3 March 2013
