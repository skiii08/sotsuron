The Ring," ***Spoilers***
","This movie is well made, well acted, and has some great visuals. It was very creepy and I enjoyed watching the story unfold. I have to disagree with people who have said it relied on run of the mill scare techniques. The story was compelling. I was sure that the video was going to be some mish mash of unexplained ambiguous crap meant only to scare and disgust the audience. Instead it's like a map of clues, albeit deadly ones. They didn't come right out and mention psychic photography, but that is what I believe it was. You see that when they show the negatives from her file. In the beginning, the teenager says they put a tape in that was supposed to have been football. Instead a bunch of strange images appear. These were images from the ghost of a girl capable of psychic photography. That was compelling in and of itself. The reporter follows the visual clues which lead her to the body of the girl and you assume that once she's peacefully buried it will all be over. This is what most ghost movies end up being. I was sitting there thinking...why would she kill innocent people...when the woman's son drops the bomb about 'why did you let her out of the dark place you weren't supposed to'. A lot of people haven't understood why her son had to make a copy or why she lived because she did. It's simple she gave the girl a victim, her son's father. The chilling part was the question the boy posed of 'What happens to the person we show the video too?' Theoretically the cycle can end by the woman being smart enough to say. Hey watch this and make a copy of it....etc etc. I was uneasy after watching it, but not terrified. It's well worth watching.",8,0,0,10 March 2003
Unbreakable," Beautiful Silence *huge spoilers*
","I have to say this is the most underrated film I've ever seen. I knew little about the movie other than Bruce Willis survives a train wreck beyond that I had no clue what it was about.  What a huge, glorious treat.  When it was over my boyfriend and I just sat in the dark silently for a while and then were up til 2 am and cuddling and talking about the movie, life etc.  This is what movies should do. Evoke a strong emotional response in their audience and be highly entertaining. As for people who didn't 'get it'. Try viewing the movie next time without blinders. Here is a brief synopsis of what the movie is about. It's about an ordinary man who finds out he isn't very ordinary after all. His feelings of melancholy about his life soon transferred to all aspects and he eventually was a shadow of his former self and contributed nothing as a father or as a husband. He finds out he is in fact extraordinary and that he has a higher purpose in life which is to use his gifts to help mankind. The brilliant twist with Jackson at the end was like poetry in motion. The subtle hints about Jackson are beautiful..the dazzling material we see peaking out of his overcoat now and again. I don't think I made the connection until the gallery when his mother explains to Willis about the two kinds of heroes.  Then I felt stupid for not putting it together sooner. How lovely that he took such care with character development and pacing. I am sorry waited for video on this.10 out of 10",10,1,2,12 July 2002
Hostel," Craptastic
","Any social commentary or message this film was trying to make was lost amid the grotesque and the obscene. People can try to convince me that this movie was brilliant, but all I witnessed was torture for the sake of torture. It was exploitation and an excuse just to see someone get horribly mutilated. I don't enjoy gore or the suffering of other people. I can't understand anyone who would want to watch this multiple times. I guess serial killers who aren't all that imaginative can really brush up on their techniques and skills. These movies are like training videos for the depraved and insane. Way to go Hollywood. How about on Oscar night when you stand up there and announce to the world how 'Movies have the power to change the world', maybe you should take responsibility for the movies that corrupt it too. Oh no you'd never do that. There is no way Hollywood would admit that a lot of the crap they produce changes the world for the worst. When it's something good they take credit and when it's horrible it's the parents responsibility to make sure their children aren't corrupted.",1,0,2,28 February 2008
Sleepy Hollow," This Movie is 'all together ooky'
",I loved this movie.  The fact that it bears no resemblance to the short story by Washington Irving really didn't affect my opinion of it.  I think if Burton had approached it as just another chapter of Sleepy Hollow people would have been more accepting of it.  The biggest complaint I hear about it is that it isn't like the story.  Aside from that it's a great story and has some incredible effects. DVD really affords the viewer the luxury of watching the heads get whacked off in slow motion. Let's face it Walken is the most frightening individual ever to grace the screen (with the exception of Batman 2).  I was very creeped out.,7,0,0,16 November 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Bedazzled and Bespelled be Me
","God bless Mr. Jackson. Dear Santa make sure Mr. Jackson has lots of good stuff in his stocking this year he has been a very good boy. First, let me say to the people who gave this a 1.....it's called imagination look into it. The fact that over 10,000 people gave it a 10 and 337 gave it a 1 tells me something is really wrong...like maybe people are giving it a 1 to keep it from having such a high score. I admit I've done this once myself. After I had voted I thought to myself that I should have just cast my actual vote instead of trying to affect the rating.    I am hoping that directors the world over will watch this film and get a clue on how a fantasy movie should be made. Ian McKellan as Gandalf was absolute magic!! He played him without the usual bravado. Actors usually ruin fantasy characters with an attempt to seem grandiose, larger than life, and it ends up simply being annoying. Ian Holm played Bilbo splendidly. In fact, the entire cast was perfect. People who aren't interested in fantasy will not understand how important this movie is to the genre and to fans everywhere. HUZZAH!!! to everyone involved in this film. I am so happy. ;->",10,0,0,24 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," additional comments
","Some people have asked in the comments how dare we put it up there with movies like 'The Godfather' or other 'beloved' classics. Do I think it's as good as 'The Godfather'? Yes I do. It's better in my opinion simply because I am a huge fan of fantasy. The Godfather is a classic, but it also bored the *&^% out of me. I really don't care about criminals or their lifestyles and I really hate movies that sensationalize them. 17,000 people have loved this film enough to give it a 10. It's my guess that the vast majority of this 17,000 are avid movie lovers which is why they have sought out a website like IMDB in the first place. I base my first opinion on whether a movie is good or not...on whether I enjoyed it, learned something from it, or it evoked some emotional response. I can appreciate Citizen Kane for it's contribution to movie making and directing, but if given a choice of watching it or LOTR over and over again locked in a room for 24 hours...guess which one I'd choose.  'Our Vines Have Tender Young Grapes' 'Ghostbusters' 'The Ox-Bow Incident' 'Night of the Hunter'  'How Green Was My Valley' 'Empire Strikes Back' 'Jane Eyre  (1944)' 'On Borrowed Time' 'Excalibur' 'The Thing'  'Windwalker' 'Babette's Feast' etc These are among my favorite movies and I think LOTR would fine them pleasant company. Don't assume that the votes given to this movie were uneducated ones just because you believe yourself some sort of aficionado of the cinema. I still believe that it's unfair of people to give this movie a 1 just because they're trying to change it's rank in the top 250. I'd much rather see a movie about the humble and unassuming overcoming great odds to defeat evil like LOTR in number 1, than a movie about selfish brutes killing one another and upholding archaic outdated notions of honor in 'The Godfather'.",10,0,0,3 January 2002
The Thing," A study in paranoia *spoilers*
","I love this film. I recently bought it and watched it last night with my boyfriend, who hadn't seen it.  He really doesn't care much for tv or movies. He was reading a book while I was cuddled up next to him on the couch for protection. Needless to say he put the book down. This movie has always frightened me. I think it's the paranoia that intrigues me the most. The fact that we don't know let's us experience the character's hysteria. I think the reason I appreciate this film so much is that the characters do not find a solution.  This is what is so scary.  The language barrier between the Norwegians and the Americans isn't broken as a character reveals some hidden talent for languages.  (referring to the notes that they find) The chance to do the test the doctor suggests is sabotaged. The person then put in charge of finding a new way to test for infection disappears. We never get an answer as to what happened with him. The one that Macready comes up with is perfect. It's simple yet does the job.The effects in this are horrifying, even after all these years. This movie has really held up. At the end when Macready and Childs are looking at each other and know they are both going to die is truly moving.  Yet you're still scared because you don't know if one of them is infected or not that the fate of the world still doomed despite their altruistic actions.",10,0,1,24 November 2000
The Patriot," I cried but tears do not a good movie make
","I cried a lot during this movie, but I don't think emotional outbursts are the best way to judge a movie's worth. My biggest problem with the movie is I can't stand Mel Gibson.  So my own bias is going to affect how I voted which was an 8 out of 10.  Visually I really liked this movie. It had some great shots.  I only paid 50 cents to see it so it was well worth the money. I love second run theaters. I am starting to think that Mel studied at the Jessica Lange school of over-acting. The director did a good job of pretending to be John Ford. For some reason all the little things they tried to put in the movie like the rocking chair and the locket served only to annoy me.  I will view the movie again a year or so and see how I feel about it then.",8,0,1,16 November 2000
Dirty Dancing," Dorm room trauma
","One of the most horrible memories I have of college is that in our dorm they seemed to run this movie 24/7.  I would go down to the TV lounge to watch something and it would be filled with my peers pajama clad and munching on popcorn and clutching their box of kleenex.  It was a constant rotation of Pretty Woman, Dirty Dancing and Can't Buy Me Love. I have night terrors because of it. I hated the movie. I hate Patrick Swayze. I think it goes back to his promotion of the movie as having more substance than Footloose or Flashdance....like saying that cotton candy has more substance than marshmellows. I have to give this movie a 1 to counteract the average of a 5 on this film. I would normally had given it a 3, but the majority of you folks left me no choice. I don't know that this movie inspires anger in me but that time of your life song makes me cower and whimper curled up in a fetal position. The biggest clue that this movie lacked anything interesting, it wasn't in black and white.",3,3,9,17 November 2000
Cars," Simple Way of Life
","This movie captured the sadness of dried up towns in America. There is so much more to America than the big cities. There are small towns all over this country that are slowly dying out. Railroad towns, Route 66 towns etc. Every time I go home and visit the town I grew up in I am saddened by how much it has declined. I wish I could live back home, but there are no jobs. The use of shadows in this movie is probably what struck me the most. The shadow of Mack on the side of the road as he's traveling, the dappled effect on the road as Sally and Lightening are driving, etc. Everything is so subtle that you forget that it's not real. That a group of people actually sat and created this world is astounding. We're so jaded and cynical about everything. This movie was obviously a labor of love for Pixar and it shows. I would suggest this movie to anyone who is given to nostalgia and sentimentality, especially for Americana. If you're not then this movie might be boring to you.",10,0,0,11 October 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Magical
","When I saw this in the movie theater I actually set forward on my seat the entire movie. I was completely captivated. This movie took a lot of work and it shows. Jack is such a wonderful character. The music is excellent. When the opening music starts it pulls you into the story. It's rare that I see a movie that stirs my childlike imagination. This movie brought back all my anticipation as a child. I remember how exciting it was every holiday waiting for the x-mas programs to air on TV. With the advent of cable and VCRs I feel sad for the kids who won't get to experience that joy, but I am sure they have their own experiences to look forward to. I thought it was amusing to hear people complain about how 'dark' the movie was. I asked them what they thought Halloween town should look like? I pointed out how bright and festive X-mas town was. That usually shuts them up. If that doesn't work there is always duct tape. ;-P",10,0,1,27 November 2001
A Bug's Life," Delightful
","I worried about the people who have animosity for this movie. I think it's a great movie for kids and has an excellent message. It shows that thinking outside the box can be of great benefit to society as a whole.  It shows how team work can solve problems. Aside from that it was funny and great to look at.  Is it an accurate depiction of insect life...no.  I didn't care that the ants weren't anatomically correct.  The male mosquito ordering a bloody Mary was interesting as well, since males don't drink blood or so my degree in science from the discovery channel would have me believe.  Anyway check this movie out. I enjoyed it a lot more than Ants for the very fact that Woody Allen is no where to be found.",10,0,0,16 November 2000
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Too Intense for Small Children *spoilers*
","I thought this was better than the first. I've read all the books and am impatiently waiting for the next. Each book gets darker and darker as Harry gets older. All I have to say to people complaining that this was too much like the first is what did you expect? Just to fill you in the entire series is about Harry Potter, a boy wizard and his adventures at the Hogwarts. Guess what? He's going to interact with the same set of characters and he's going to be battling the same evil threat every time, which is his nemesis Voldemort. Here are some Major Spoilers. In case you missed it....Malfoy plants the diary in the Weasley girl's bag. She starts interacting with it. Volemort's spirit is in the diary and starts to thrive on her energy. She gets scared and tries to throw it away. Potter finds it. Which enlightens him about Hagrid's past at the school. It's more of a mystery than the first one. On a special note..Gilderoy Lockhart was not 'the bad guy' he was an arrogant, cowardly, blowhard. The continuing theme in the books is that Hogwarts keeps losing their Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. If I sound overly sarcastic and patronizing it's because I am. This movie is way too intense for little kids, but both of them are going to be classics just like Willy Wonka and Wizard of Oz, because they ARE too intense for little kids. We adults may not think of them as classics, but we're not the ones who are currently being mesmerized and captivated. Of course the child in me is completely bewitched by the entire series. This may be why the Xian sects are all up in arms. They want their children fearing hell and damnation, not a wizard who can be defeated by a little boy. I've heard all the arguments of why Harry Potter is luring kids to witchcraft....so what if it is? I say we can use more witches and warlocks in this world and less religious bigotry, repression and ignorant violent behavior ignited over say.... a beauty pageant. It's highly entertaining and original and is classic just like The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka, The Dark Crystal, Nightmare Before X-mas. P.S. The Basilisk was incredible!! ;->",10,0,0,29 November 2002
The Iron Giant," magical...*possible spoilers*
","I absolutely loved this film. I love how it captured the magical spirit of 40s sci-fi. I can't explain it, but there was this overwhelming feeling of nostalgia as I watched it. It left me with this bittersweet feeling. I felt loss and sorrow, but it wasn't a negative feeling. It was like having touched the most fragile parts of humanity and realizing those were your parts. I think the feelings were amplified for the time period than the actual content of the movie. It's funny since my parents were just born in the 40s and I wasn't even around. I thought the most touching part was the homage to superman. I thought it was interesting that this alien's desire to emulate a fictional alien made him more human. It was because Superman has always embodied all the very traits that as humans we strive to posess. His desire to be like Superman meant he yearned to be good, although programmed only to do harm. The animation was beautiful. I am really leary of people who didn't understand or enjoy this film.",10,0,1,20 November 2001
Shrek," umm...
","Well, I usually love this type of film and I love Mike Myers. There was something missing in this movie and kept it from being great. I can't forgive it for that. I mean when I laughed which was maybe twice they were really good laughs, but that isn't enough to make a movie great. Granted every movie doesn't have to be a masterpiece, but when you obviously put so much time into something you should make sure it's complete. I think part of the problem was Eddie Murphy as the donkey. It was very annoying and just not funny at all....period. The three blind mice were great. The basic plot was good. They should have spent more time with the relationship between the ogre and the princess. Throughout the movie I was either grossed out or shocked. Hopefully the next one will be better, but I'm not going to hold my breath.",6,0,0,26 November 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Breath of fresh air
","All I can say is I avoided this film because I am so tired of the same Disney formula. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I finally viewed it.  I went with my boyfriend and his 4 year old son. It may have been above the 4 year old's head, but the point is it was clean and he watched it. I am not quite sure why everyone thinks that every Disney film or film that's geared toward kids has to be solely for children. Let's face it kids stop to stare at commercials.  Everything is new and somewhat confusing to them. It's part of growing up learning to puzzle these things out. Kids need things that are suitable for them true, but adults need things that they can be entertained by and occupy their child as well. Anyone who has kids or are around them know that you will spend a lot of time watching the same Disney movie or cartoon over and over and over and over.  Kids don't get bored with it because it's all new to them. So giving The Emperor's New Groove a poor rating based on the fact that your 4 year old didn't get every joke is inane, asinine, absurd..etc.     I gave this movie a 10 based on the fact that I was highly entertained. Critics need to try rating something based on what it is rather than what it isn't. Movies should either entertain, provoke thought, elicit an emotional response, be awe inspiring, or in some way advance movie making be it through technical machinations or plot devices etc. *see Citizen Kane*. There are few films that have been successful in executing most of that criteria.     Will you laugh and giggle while watching this?...Yes...quite a bit. David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Seinfeld's Puddy do a wonderful job. If you haven't this yet please do. If you loved Alladin you will appreciate this film. 10/10",10,0,2,19 March 2001
Mr. Holland's Opus," This movie inspires disgust in me
","I really can't explain it. I had a definite chemical reaction to this film. I perhaps need to watch it again because my mood may have affected my perception. I do remember laughing really hard at the cheesy scene when he is singing John Lennon's 'Beautiful Boy'. I mean it was uncomfortable to watch. When he actually signed C-O-L-E, I remember sort of looking at my best friend and we both started laughing. I guess it is because I didn't find him a very inspiring human being let alone an inspiring teacher. I need to watch it again in a few years and see how I've changed and how I relate to this film.",3,6,16,3 July 1999
Signs," Very Simple Film
","Well, I can't say that the film is as good as his previous work. I still feel 'Unbreakable' was his best film. I did think the plot to this was very weak and predictable and not at all as good as his other efforts, but something about how simple this was appealed to me. I love that it's slow and takes it's time. I truly enjoyed the characters and came to care about them. It frustrates me that it fell so short when it had such potential. Phoenix was excellent in this and pretty much stole the show. Also the little boy played by Rory Culkin was very good and a much better actor than his older brother. The little girl was adorable and I really enjoyed the touch of her obsession with water. Gibson did a good job and it was nice to see him in a role were he wasn't the almighty hero with all the answers. In this he was a broken man who really didn't know how to handle the situation. His weakness was scorned by his children. I think there were strong performances from everyone even the local cop who I thought was fantastic. If you can get around the sub-plot of the aliens it's a very nice film. That's right I said sub-plot. The main point isn't about regaining faith either. The main point is that events in our lives happen for reasons we couldn't comprehend, but they happen for a reason. For people bent out shape over the religious aspects I just have to say get over it. It was a very simple film with a simple message. I enjoyed it and the people in the audience with me seemed to enjoy it enough to clap at the end. Although not everyone applauded I think we all got more than our money's worth.
