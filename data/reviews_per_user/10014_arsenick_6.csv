Marie Antoinette," A nice tale but not a biography
","As a Frenchman, I was really delighted to watch a movie about Marie-Antoinette, coming from outer-Atlantic. We cut her head off, but I notice that she is always fascinating people from the oldest republics in the world: USA and France. The movie is well colored, costumes are marvelous, using rock and roll music is also a good idea. The actors are not bad, especially Mary-Jane Watson in the main part, as Sofia Coppola elected to see Marie -Antoinette as a lost teenager, unadapted to a so much exposed and sumptuous court. What Coppola uses to say is that she was 14 when she came in France. OK, she is right. But to be 14 in the XVIIIth century was very different from now. The 'teenagers' was not a concept in itself. At that time, people was either children or adult. And adulthood was earlier than now. Children from the mob used to work very early, and the others were educated to become rulers very soon. Marie-Antoinette was raised to be a princess or a queen, even if protocol at the Austrian court was loser than at the French one. Furthermore, she was not a teenager any more when she became queen, as she was 18. It was the age of maturity at that time. So, she had no excuse for being immature, what she was not any more. That is the only bad thing about this movie. It doesn't say a word about the greatest about: her treachery. She betrayed France by choosing to be Austrian before being queen of France and sent valuable information to her brother (Emperor of Austria) through the Austrian ambassador first, and then through her lover Axel Fersen. Another grief could be her bad advices to her husband who truly loved her (which was quite unusual) and trusted her in politics. One of the explanations of the failure of the monarchy could have been the court system and the Chinese wall between the rulers and the people, but not the age of the Queen. The movie ends at the most interesting period of French history: the beginning of the revolution.However, this movie is amusing if you do not imagine that it was reality.",6,0,0,3 September 2007
Black Book," Black or dark?
","Both, I could say. Somme comments on this movie enhanced the '50's movies' style of it, which I agree on, but it is obviously a European movie, without heroes and villains, however we clearly see who is good and who is bad. The only thing is that good is not always simple as it appears to be. Almost every character is very much complex. I only have one doubt about the 'traitor''s character (I do not reveal it, but you know that there is always one or several). We do not have enough comprehensive background about this character. Except from it, all characters are deep...and sound as human nature may be reassuring, capable of doing right AND wrong. Actors are wonderful. I have always loved dutch actors ...and actresses. Dutch people often say that their language is useless as it is only spoken by them. Even thought I do not understand it except when they use words similar to English, it is always a pleasure to hear it as it sounds to be a whistle which sometimes go deep into the throat. I am eager to watch the first WWII movie shot by Verhoeven. I first discovered Sci-Fi Verhoeven's movies, like most people among us. I appreciate his long sight about human nature, and this movie is a very sharp example of it. This movie is also dealing with issues not developed but still there, as the link between stolen gold from the Jewish families and Germans, Israel and south America or any other place where Nazis ere hidden after the war. I just do not know what to think about the last seconds of the movie: the attack of the 1956's war involving Israel, as Israell was one of the aggressors against Egypt, along with UK and France. I have just seen the movie and may need more coolness to think about it. Anyway, go and watch it!!",10,2,3,18 October 2007
Match Point," Almost a masterpiece
","I am an Allen's fan, and I love his movies when they are truly amazing, as some of them are (the list should be long). However, besides that, he has always made small entertaining quickly-shot movies that I like much less, but that would be good enough if not directed by Allen. He did a couple of such kind of movies recently.'Match Point' does not it either category. It is shot as a 'genre' film, which Allen loves to do, shot and taken place in Britain, as an Ivory movie, underlying the inside perversity of British high society. The story is full of questions, the actors are tremendous, but... I am disappointed! Why? I did know at first sight. I believe that the movie is challenging, and that Allen did not achieved his goal. Nola's character is finally not deep enough, despise the great talent of Scarlett Johansson. She even get us hoping more about the depth and tragedy of her character. Unfortunately, she does not appear to be such a fatal woman as she is supposed to be one, because of her appearing sensibility.She really loves Chris. And the scenario treats her character as a supporting one, explaining Chris'choices. Chris as well, did not succeed in being a tormented person, choosing deliberately to have a classical and healthy life, even if it is fake. The moment of the choice and the final ending are too quick. Only the ghosts of 2 dead women are there to suggest the terrible inside dilemma and guiltiness. The British actors (devonian, londoner and Scottish ones)are perfect in their supporting roles. I guess it is not the fault of the actors. It simply does not work, after having been mostly promising. That is a pity!!",5,1,4,18 June 2006
The Aviator," Could have been a wonder
","This movie could have been a wonder if the main character had been portrayed by anybody else but Di Caprio. I have to confess that I appreciate Mister Caprio's efforts to fit the great and complex character, but its not enough, obviously. He does not succeed in making us forget leonardo and see Howard. The womanizer Hughes was not present at all: Leonardo is shy and appears as such. The 'Lolita' scenes with the 15 years old actress is not believable. seduction and Bluff parts of Hughes' personality were not there. Good rates: Alan Alda, mean and corrupted ; Kate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn: wonderful!; John C.Reilly: good as usual in a supporting role; the story. Other bad rates: the coloring choices: interesting but not always relevant (ex: the golf party between Hughes and hepburn).Please watch it anyway, it's worth it, but it could have been a great movie. Robert Downey Jr did well in 'Chaplin' what Leonardo Di Caprio fails here. But it was not an easy challenge. Congatulations anyway for your real efforts, Leonardo.",5,2,3,22 January 2006
National Treasure," waste of talent but not of money
","It is one of these blockbusters made to be efficient and earn money. Cage has his typical blockbusters-noemotionnormoving-face and acting. Sean Bean is in it (I should hae be warned, I do not know any good movie with Bean in it), as well as Jon Voight,who is not really acting but only appearing from 'MI 1' (as he had reluctantly shot movies that did not deserved his talent). On the other side,Christopher Plummer and Harvey Keitel (as good as usual) do waste their talents while playing supporting roles. Diane Kruger is delightful, and the young hero's best friend is doing his best (which is not so bad). The story is funny, but above all, the way it is screen-played is pathetic: Dear studios, please fire your popcorn-writers and hire real ones! The result is a pale copy of 'Indiana Jones' movies. What makes the movie watchable when you want to empty your mind, is the slight humor in it (and Diane Kruger's beautiful...eyes and...smile).However, the underlying references are interesting, enlightening the free masons' role in the building of the free US and their values (together with the pilgrim fathers and protestants), from the declaration of independence to the mason symbol on USD bills.",2,2,4,8 July 2006
300," Could be a successful propaganda
","I feel exactly the same as many people about this movie (i.e kind of fascist values, melting defense of the race and civilization, body glorification, and hate over decadent and perverse eastern peoples), but I am wondering about the intent: was it made to condemn that fascism or to glorify it? I preferred to choose the second option, while kind of liking the movie anyway. It is well shot, not too bloody, and much better than epic movies like 'the lord of the rings'. Sex scenes are very exciting and beautiful, as well as the oracle's scene. I also fear that this version of the Battle of Thermopylae will be kept in the mind of main people to be historical. We do know that Xerxes was not evil and Leonidas was not good. The reality of both aechemenid Persia and Sparta is more complex. Anyway, we must also remind that the story of the Battle of Thermopylae had been written in ancient times to be a glorification to Sparta and Greece, as a propaganda against new enemies and towards a unification of the geek cities. We knew the same with the war of Troy, the battle of Marathon, all Egyptian stories, even the bible's stories were mainly made for strategic and political goals. So, it would not be fool to think that this movie nowadays could be used as a propaganda against Iran and/or an alliance of Turkey with Asian states.",8,3,5,29 September 2007
